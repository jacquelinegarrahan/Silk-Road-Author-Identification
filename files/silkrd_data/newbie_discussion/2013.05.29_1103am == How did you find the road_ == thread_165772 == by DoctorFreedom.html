				I found it years and years ago through an article on it and some google searching, and checked it out but decided not to pursue it. How I wish I did, I would be swimming in BTC. But alas, I did not seriously delve into until recently, when someone brought it up to me in conversation, and I realized I could now do something with it.

				I got incredibly lucky finding SR.&nbsp; I had been burned soooo many times online, and gave up about 1 year ago.&nbsp; However, about 15-20 days ago I realized that I wasn&#039;t going to make it the entire month with my suboxone, so I started looking around where I live to find something to hold me over.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I live in very small &quot;good ol boy network&quot; town, and I&#039;m from the east coast.&nbsp; Obviously couldn&#039;t find anything around here, so I once again I began looking online....&nbsp; Eventually I came to some website that listed &quot;supposed&quot; sites that wouldn&#039;t burn you.&nbsp; As I read on, I was somewhat intrigued by what it said about SR, so I downloaded TOR......Typed in the SR address (which was listed on the site).....and......BAM!!&nbsp; The &quot;Log In / Sign-up&quot; page appeared...&nbsp; I signed up, and then SR took me to the listing page of &quot;drugs,&quot; and all of sudden I felt like I was in a movie.....&nbsp; You know....

				I happened upon an article about it online.&nbsp; Finally got up the nerve to download Tor to access it.&nbsp; Read the listings and forums non-stop for a week.&nbsp; Finally decided that to take the plunge.&nbsp; So far both my orders have been problematic, but I&#039;m convinced that SR works.&nbsp; I think I know more now and am picking and choosing better.&nbsp; It is really fantastic, opening up a whole world which I&#039;d never be able to access in RL.&nbsp; Amazing!

				Pretty sure I first heard of SR thru articles online. Probably the same Gawker article. Did further research on BTC. Tried to access SR on a whim about a year ago. had the URL &amp; tor setup, but couldn&#039;t get the page to load. Gave up on it. Tried again about&nbsp; months ago, and I was persistent enough to finally figure it out. So far its been wonderful, minus the downtime from hack-attack. And now I have two orders in resolution. But this literally could be the most important community I&#039;ve ever been a part of in my life.

It&#039;s almost like they want more people to find out about it haha. I heard through a friend that made a successful purchase.

				Some interesting stories about how you all ended up here!<br /><br />I found out about SR in June 2011, when a friend emailed me the Gawker article. Over the next week, I got my head around Tor and access the marketplace and forums. I could hardly believe it was real, but real it was - since then I&#039;ve been observing the marketplace and forums, and commenting on the site to mainstream media in Australia and abroad (I&#039;m a drug policy researcher - I did my PhD on drugs and the internet, so ended up being approached for comment on SR...)<br /><br />I got really interested in Bitcoin late last year when I attended a cryptoparty, then hooked up with a guy who sells bitcoin directly to buyers through bitcoin-otc. I purchase some coin, and then watched them wildly rise in value only to fall dramatically (March-April) - that was a wild ride. The more I learn about virtual currencies, the more it looks like they will be the way of the future. It is exciting that money could be transferred without government management/oversight and across international borders without attracting transaction fees (when person to person).<br /><br />When I speak with media on SR, they often say they don&#039;t want to write a &#039;how to&#039; because they don&#039;t want to encourage people to use SR. Of course, all the media has to do is mention the name and they can spark someone&#039;s curiosity, who just needs to do a little online research to end up here. And as all your testimonies above show, the media is playing a large role in increasing overall awareness of the site.

				After discovering bitcoin a few years ago, I wondered whether you could buy drugs with it ... after a while of googling, I figured that you could:) Ended up making some orders on OVDB due to better prices and migrated to SR once OVDB ceased to exist ...

There was a very small artical in the back of i think rolling stone mag .After reading about it i tore the page out and kept it safe for the next 3 1/2 years till i was released back into the wild. Now i am learning the ropes and staying safe as can be. Love the road, its wondrous

I think it was CNN or maybe Faux News. <br /><br />Funny how it was basically an advertisement lol, even though they were talking about it being a bad thing obviously. <br /><br />A week later I am getting my Tramadol for less money than a doctor visit and trip to the pharmacy costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D ;D ;D<br />
