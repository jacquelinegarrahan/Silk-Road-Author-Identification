				I just want some feedback on this situation...I am a newbie on SR, I think maybe 14 purchases, nothing huge...I have my favorite vendors I use, but this last week I tried someone else out.&nbsp; Excellent feedback on SR and on here, I selected the super speedy shipping (WAS needed asap) that has been 8 days ago.&nbsp; I messaged him, he said he couldn&#039;t log onto SR for the last two days, sent the package out the next day...I still haven&#039;t received it, I am not too worried about it not showing up, but what I&#039;m kind of ticked at is this was the fast shipping I paid extra for...In the terms they demand 5/5 feedback and if the product shows up I&#039;m hesitant for leaving anything less because A: these are dealers, I&#039;d rather not fuck with them and B:I will have my product, but I feel taken on the shipping costs.&nbsp; I have had first class packages show up faster and most priority arrives in 3 days so something that is overnight or even 2 day shipping (SHOULD) arrive faster, right? :/&nbsp; &nbsp; So long story short, should I leave 5/5 feedback but bring this mishap up when leaving feedback, or just ignore it all together?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to really mention names, don&#039;t want to piss off anyone...&nbsp; Does messaging the vendor to complain help?&nbsp; Like I said, I&#039;m a newbie pretty much and have never had any problems before...Any helpful advice would be great before I go pissing someone off..

				BE HONEST,POLITE AND FRIENDLY.<br /><br />ASK FOR A PARTIAL REFUND ON SHIPPING BUT OF COURSE AFTER FINALIZING AND AFTER GETTING YOUR GOODS! :)<br /><br />I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE FROM A SELLER AND BUYERS POINT OF VIEW.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF ITEM WAS ORDERED?

				Small order of a few Oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; Not a huge deal at all for either of us, which is why I am not too crazy about screwing up this persons feedback, but still money is money, right?&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Iceprincess huh?... sounds cold.<br /><br />I&#039;d message them.&nbsp; I mean what can it hurt?&nbsp; Maybe dude will toss some coin back to you... and if no compromise can met, do what&nbsp; you have to.

				I personally would ask for the difference back between the super speedy shipping and just regular. If they agree to that, I&#039;d leave a 5/5. <br /><br />If that didn&#039;t fly, then I would ding their rating and explain in the review what happened to give other prospective buyers a heads up, in case it isn&#039;t just a one time thing.
