				It certainly beats driving around and dealing with dodgy dealers in person, especially since anything apart from weed and pills are rediculously hard to find where I live (well, at least as much as I know). It actually turned out that one of my last dealers was just using SR to order me products, and charging me quite a premium, so I&#039;m glad I started doing it myself.

I myself feel safer, more secure, while conducting business with SR vendors.

				Welcome! Until you get to 50 posts, you can only post in the newbie disucussion area. It has something to do with preventing spam I guess.

				Agreed OP. Although in relation to weed, i think the UK can do a lot better in terms of quality. The weed on here most definitely beats street weed, but there is still an abundance of pretty poorly grown weed.
