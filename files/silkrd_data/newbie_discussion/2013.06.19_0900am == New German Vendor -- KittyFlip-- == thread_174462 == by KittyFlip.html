				Hello,<br />I&#039;ve had perfectly smooth and fast deal with KittyFlip and I would like to give my feedback.<br /><br />The item was a tab of acid.<br /><br />Communication was amazing, all of my messages got answered in less than 2 hours.<br />I was lacking a couple cents due to BTC fluctuation but we worked out this issue instantly.<br />Item was shipped in just a few hours after order was placed.<br />Arrived in 3 days within EU.<br />Stealth was very good.<br />Product is really nice, good acid. Strong, probably somewhere around 120 mcg indeed.<br /><br />Thank you for the smooth deal, I appreciate it. :)

				@touchthesky<br /><br />If I could I would have PGP already but unfortunalety it&#039;s not possible for me at the moment... Sorry but I&#039;m working on it. If you want you can use Privenote as an alternative, if that&#039;s okay for you.... :)

				Ordered one blotter of lsd and 20mg of 2C-B. I have never ordered anything like this before so I was really surprised how small those things were. :)<br />Anyway:<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5, arrived in 2 days, can&#039;t ask for a faster delivery, at least until teleportation is invented.<br />Stealth: 5/5, I&#039;m no expert on this, but it got here without any problems, and I got a bit confused when opening it so I guess it&#039;s good. :)<br />Product: So far I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but it looks good, got what I ordered, so I trust it will be a 5/5<br /><br />Can&#039;t tell anything about communication as it wasn&#039;t needed since it arrived so fast without any problems.<br /><br />I&#039;d say he&#039;s a great vendor worth ordering from.

				I wanted to wait until I had sampled things to write a review.<br />The k tested as k, it was purchased to try a low dose as a depression treatment because I&#039;ve read some promising things about it as a depression treatment. I tried it a week ago and my mood has been improved pretty significantly for the last few days.<br />i tried 15mg of the 4-HO-MiPT and had a good experience. Amazing how fast it kicks in. The duration is short but it didn&#039;t feel like the experience was too short. The tactile effects were awesome. I really look forward to trying this with my wife.<br />As fot the Vendor KittyFlip is awesome. Fast communication, friendly, and I don&#039;t know how he does it, I got my order in 4 days to the east coast! Great stealth. I will be a repeat customer!

				Got my second order from KittyFlip last weekend. <br />He´s now my favorit speed vendor at SR.<br /><br />Speed has a good quality and a really nice effect - that´s how i like it!<br /><br />The package is super-ninja-stealth, no one i´ll ever guess, what´s inside.<br />And shipping time was both time next day delivery - that´s awesome, because lot of Speed-Vendors are so slow and instead of your order you get lame excuses for delay. <br /><br />I´m glad, I found a new reliable Vendor.<br /><br />THX for the smooth deals - Please go on that way!<br /><br />Greetz<br />
