				The more you do, the deeper you go...<br /><br />Even as a K veteran, I&#039;ll often only want the mild sensory effects that come from a bump or two.&nbsp; I usually find my senses get muddled, such that I can *feel* things that I hear (like music), as though they have form and shape.<br /><br />Lines lead to much greater disconnect between self and reality, which I think can most succinctly be described as &quot;powdered confusion&quot; (it&#039;s as though something profound is just beyond one&#039;s reach, and nothing really makes much sense - disorienting, but fun).<br /><br />Much more than that, and you&#039;ll likely &quot;k-hole&quot; where you zone out entirely and are left alone to your crazy confused thoughts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t find it a very sociable drug (meaningful interaction is bloody difficult), so if you&#039;re going to be around a bunch of people who aren&#039;t familiar with K you might want to steer clear - they might get freaked out by the confused, barely communicative, dribbling mess.<br /><br />I&#039;d also warn against combining with alcohol, as I invariably find that leads to the prompt evacuation of my stomach.&nbsp; Of course, for that matter it&#039;s not really wise to combine with ANY form of CNS depressant.

				Thanks for the help, I live in the US and when I was younger we had never heard of K. I don&#039;t know if it wasn&#039;t around, or if it wasn&#039;t around my the circle I ran with. I only ordered a 1/2g to start with, I am really excited to try something new. Can you tell me how long I can expect to be under the spell of the K?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks Mr420

				I&#039;d guesstimate that the most significant effects of a bump last around half an hour, whereas a line is perhaps twice that?<br /><br />That said, it&#039;s pretty hard to tell as one loses all sense of time (and certainly in my case, I tend to redose).&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend operating any heavy machinery or trying to drive within a good few hours at VERY LEAST.&nbsp; Interested to hear other&#039;s thoughts on this one.
