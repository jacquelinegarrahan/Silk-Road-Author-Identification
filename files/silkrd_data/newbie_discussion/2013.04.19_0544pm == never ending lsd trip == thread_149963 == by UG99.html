				well you might get perfectly good answers here too, but its important to talk to people who&#039;ve met people in similar situations - unfortunately psychiatrists might not have a lot of experience with people with histories with psychedelics. there&#039;s a lot of issues at play and talking to people can be great help. Ive had plenty of &quot;issues&quot; with dream life/waking life spirit-world/consensus-reality world and it can be a huge struggle. For me it came down to realising that other people are also the center of the universe, just like me, and they&#039;re not illusions, nor are they inferior. many people in fact go in and through the multiple dimensions all the time and can still come back and inhabit consensus-reality without a struggle, and this is my goal (to a degree). This comes with the tough lessons of compassion, which is tied tightly with empathy. my goal is also to contact the people who are not like me, and to understand their reality so that I can be closer to the whole of the human race. like i say, there are lots of things at play here and it&#039;s up to you to heal yourself, and find your own way through the cosmos, possibly picking up things you lost along the way, and finding new ways to protect yourself and strengthen your spirit. At the end of the day, all is well and the cosmos is balanced.
