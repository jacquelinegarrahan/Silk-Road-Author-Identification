				It seems that vendors all push you to give them 5 out of 5 and get real but hurt if you don&#039;t.<br /><br />I think the ranking system should be just that, rank the experience and the product with an honest rank. It seems that if you receive the product then you are obligated to give them 5 out of 5. I think it would be much easier to find the good vendors if the system was used as intended.

It&#039;s a new vendor and the reviews he has all say he ships fast which is why i chose him, to give him a chance to get his transaction count up. i hope i didn&#039;t make a mistake.

				The entire ratings and review system needs some work.&nbsp; DreadPirateRoberts has a topic going on right now in the main forums about this, and everyone is chiming in.&nbsp; I thought about it some and I think here are the core issues:<br /><br />1. No clear definition/enforcement of rating/review standards.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Does a package that arrived late but had high quality constitute a 5/5?&nbsp; Should vendors be allowed to request &#039;good faith&#039; 5/5 FEs?)<br /><br />2. There is no differentiation between the purchase and the product.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Are we reviewing the overall experience with the vendor?&nbsp; Or just the product? What about communication and shipping?)<br /><br />3. Vendors are requesting FE too often and without cause.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Even &#039;good&#039; vendors end up asking for FE, and that leads to false ratings &quot;aka 5/5 FE&quot; which are bad for the community)<br /><br />4. Buyers are allowing FE&#039;s to happen too often and without cause.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(In the spirit of faith in the system we&#039;ve all FE&#039;d a &#039;trusted&#039; vendor and faked a review/rating, which again, is bad for the community)<br /><br />5.+ ? (Please add in your thoughts)<br /><br />Personal anecdotes: <br /><br />&nbsp;- Vendor Name: V3SPAR<br />&nbsp;- Product: Weed<br />&nbsp;- R/R: High, with perfect 5.0 score, positive feedback in reviews and product comments - no suspicious behavior<br />&nbsp;- Result: No ship, no tracking.&nbsp; SR resolution with 50% refund.&nbsp; Vendor claimed buyer scam, but did not provide any shipping details.<br />&nbsp;- Note: * Left bad taste in my mouth for SR; I receive various SR products to my secured ship point without fail; this was first no-show/no-ship.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* I feel like the vendor was selectively scamming; and was poor in communication.&nbsp; But R/R was high with perfect 5.0 :( <br /><br />- Vendor Name: Haizenberg<br />- MDMA &amp; LSD Blotter<br />- R/R: High, 4.9 score, mixed feeback in reviews and product comments - some late-ship reported<br />- Result: Eventually ordered three times from vendor:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) LSD Blotter: Asked for FE based on positive reviews, and I obliged; product arrived in 1.5 weeks from EUR, but had no drug effect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) MDMA Messaged vendor about order; without asking he sent a free blotter to me as apology; along with high grade MDMA; arrived in 2 weeks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(3) LSD Blotter: Based on positive experience, I ordered additional blotter from different brand, vendor has been communicating in process<br />- Note: This vendor maintains a good amount of criticism, and R/R show mixed bag, but I had a great experience every time. What gives?<br /><br />Theres more examples like this but I would love to see SR make some editorial and admin changes to prevent situation 1 from happening more and giving &#039;good&#039; vendors like in situation 2 more exposure and positive credit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway my long winded 2 cents.<br /><br /><br /><br />-

				It swings both ways sometimes there is a 5/5 for bad service etc and somethimes there is a 1/5 for a scammer it takes time but you can normally spot them after a while

				One of my concerns is vendors who put up listings for product they don&#039;t have. Or they run out of product before they run out of listings. Ordering blow is hit and miss, and when I order based on pictures and reviews of a certain batch, I expect to get that batch. If a vendor runs out and has to resupply there is a chance that the new batch is going to be different. It could be better or it could be worse, but it&#039;s not right if I order something then I get something I didn&#039;t order. Like i said earlier I put an order early thursday and it really should have gone out on friday, but it hasn&#039;t been marked in transit yet. I really went out of my way to obtain the bitcoins I needed so I could order it thursday in hopes that it would have the weekend to travel and get here on Monday or the latest tuesday. Right now I am looking at tuesday if I am extremely lucky or wed IF he ships on Monday. I&#039;m sure when I get it I am expected to release the funds as soon as I open it but I would like to wait and try it first so I can give an honest review on it.<br /><br />I know i am being a little impatient about it, but having been scammed one time already I am a little worried. Something tells me to have faith in this guy though, i get good vibes from him so here&#039;s hoping.
