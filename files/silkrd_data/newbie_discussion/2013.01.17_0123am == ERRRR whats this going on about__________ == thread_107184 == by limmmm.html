				Yeah, I&#039;m totally not feeling this. Just wrote the third review for my third transaction, and found that I couldn&#039;t post it. It was a juicy one, too, re: some Agent Orange Outdoor currently for sale. But Alas! I was silenced. Wasting my time.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m not willing to play games to become allowed to post reviews in the main review thread for a vendor, nor do I aspire to move out of the &quot;below 50&quot; ghetto. I&#039;m just looking to review purchases to improve the quality of information available to other buyers. I&#039;m 100% positive that I&#039;d be a member for over a year, with transactions totaling well over BTC50 before I would exceed 50 posts. The number is arbitrary, and punishes certain types of forum users (apparently, the ones focused directly on the business by discussing individual transactions they&#039;ve made).&nbsp; As a buyer, I now know that others just like me whose purchases per day avg. is equal to their posts per day average won&#039;t be sharing their experiences in the &quot;rumor mill&quot; forum until they&#039;ve made 50 or more transactions motivating them to post a review.&nbsp; In a sub-forum.<br /><br />I do urge everyone to consider the practical implications of this change, to better mitigate any challenges it might present for everyday consumers. <br /><br />Things like reports of selective scamming, which new customers are vulnerable to, should be reported in the appropriate areas on the main forum, if only to maintain the integrity of the data! <br />Possibly a consumer guru like Uniwiz can work with us on that, if things are organized in a manner that makes it convenient for others to obtain this information without wading through b.s. (which has now been encouraged, mind you, meaning constructive information gets buried).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
