				Alright I&#039;m going to upload all of these old papers of mind to try to get to 50 posts!!!<br /><br />Written by DMtryptamine285<br />This is a brief introduction of my essay on psychedelic allylbenzenes I have been working on, right now its just some notes lacking structure, I just thought I would share my insights on this little known frontier of psychedelic research,<br /><br />Many people may have powerful psychedelic drugs sitting on there spice rack and not even know it, Herbs and spices containing psychedelic allylbenzenes include nutmeg, parsley, Mace, Elemi, Dill and possibly others.<br /><br />The following compounds are known Psychedelic Allylbenzenes<br /><br />Myristicin<br />Elmicin<br />Methyl Chavicol<br /><br /><br />Normally psychedelic allylbenzenes are deactivated by CYP450, it isnt until one ingests a CYP450 inhibitor that one will experience psychedelic effects from psychedelic allylbenzenes. If one consumes a large quantity of Nutmeg without first taking the enzyme inhibitor they will only experience the anticholinergic, sedative, and emetic effects of high doses of nutmeg, which is likely why nutmeg is not a more respected psychedelic and the experience is generally described as unpleasant. The compound responsible for the many of the negative effects and toxicity of nutmeg intoxication is Trimyristicin which is not psychedelic and is not present in the essential oil of nutmeg. the effects of myristicin when combined with the proper enzyme inhibitors are quite pleasant and somewhat resemble the effects of mescaline. without the enzyme inhibitor pure myristicin has effects similar to cannabis with unbearable dry mouth.<br /><br />The combination of psychedelic allylbenzenes and Cytocrome P450 inhibitors is known in the psychedelic community as Oilahuasca, deriving its name from the amazonian brew ayahuasca (the combination of DMT containing plants and beta carbolines)<br /><br />Black Pepper and German Chamomile are both highly effective CYP450 inhibitors, german chamomile being the more effective of the two, when German chamomile (or fresh black pepper) and Elemi or nutmeg essential oils are ingested togather the result is moderate psychedelic effects, with a touch of stimulation, highly reminiscent of san pedro cacti.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Making Oilahuasca-<br />Making effective oilahuasca can be a challenge and, as with ayahuasca, it takes practice to be able to make an effective brew. here are some tips to help you get the most out of the oilahuasca experience.<br /><br />1. German Chamomile is recommended over black pepper (Note: German chamomile is not the kind of chamomile you can buy at wal-mart, it has to be German Chamomile.)<br /><br />2. Drink the German chamomile tea both 30 minutes before consuming the psychedelic allybenzene and while consuming the psychedelic allylbenzene, I like to mix the nutmeg or elemi oil into the chamomile tea.<br /><br />3. The dose varies depending on the person and the compounds used, for example with elemi oil some people only need a few drops whereas others need 10-15 drops to experience effects, Psychedelic allylbenzenes should be treated as research chemicals even though they are natural, we really don&#039;t know a lot about them and this is pretty much uncharted territory. Start low and slowly increase the dose until you find what works for you.<br /><br />4. Use the essentail oils, do not use raw nutmeg, Trimyristicin is toxic and is present in active doses in nutmeg, only using the essential oil helps to avoid this.<br /><br />5. If your still having trouble getting it to work, try putting the essential oil in enteric coated capsules and using your second dose of the german chamomile as a chaser.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Why is it important-<br />What is so facinating about these compounds is that they are so common, they are literally everywhere, every single one of you could walk into a GNC or supermarket and pick up psychedelic drugs. these compounds are so prevelant in nature on cannot help but think that they must play some role in human conciousness and thought process.<br />these compounds are the basic precursers used in the synthesis of many different tryptamines and phenethylamines, understanding how and why this works could shed some light on the bodies ability to biosynthesize compounds from there precursors, and this will give us greater insight into how Cytochrome p-450 works. Imagine how many seemingly innocuous compounds can possibly be made active by inhibiting the different digestive enzymes.<br />This will be discussed in further detail in my book I am writing called our chemical world, I will upload some more later.

				Wow you&#039;re really educated on drugs DMT! So you take a few drops nutmeg essential oil and German Chamomile and you have a mescaline-like experience? That&#039;s really interesting, I&#039;d like to try that out. Have you tried it with other oils like parlsey oil? It would be pretty funny to trip on parsley :P<br /><br />And where can you buy German chamomile or nutmeg essential oil? I&#039;ve seen essential oils but nutmeg essential oil is an oil I&#039;ve never seen... Maybe you can do the extraction yourself though, essential oils are pretty easy to extract.

				Well the place I always bought oils for the allylbenzene thing was from flowing visions. They sold elemi X and Nutmeg X which where great.<br />Elemi is more mescaline like than nutmeg oil and is quite a bit cleaner. Unfortunately flowing visions is temporarily closed right now because the owner of the site lost there passport while traveling abroad and cant get back in the country.

				Have you tried other oils than Elemi and Nutmeg? And how&#039;s Nutmeg like besides being a bit dirtier? I presume you mean there&#039;s more body load. I&#039;ll try to find Elemi oil and German Chamomile :P I hope it&#039;s not too expensive! Can German Chamomile be bought at any convenience store that sells tea?

				I vow to reach 100 posts soon just so I can give you positive karma.<br /><br />Is harmaline (e.g. syrian rue) a similar CYP450 inhibitor, or are the harmal alkaloids inhibiting something else outside of the liver. I need to re-read about monoamine oxidase, but would inhibitors of MAO be operating neurally or in the liver....

				Harmala alkaloids inhibit monoamine oxidase which is entirely different than CYP450. The allylbenzenes are hit and miss and are very much dependent on your individual metabolism, nutmeg seems to be the easiest to get working but make sure to use essential oil NOT WHOLE NUTMEG (whole nutmeg as most of you should know, feels absolutely terrible).<br /><br />Nutmeg is much more speedy and less psychedelic than elemi but as I said, works for most people whereas elemi requires more enzymatic modulation and is alot of trial and error.<br /><br />Yes, there are alot of essential oils that work and I will post a more comprehensive thread on the subject of allylbenzenes once I get my 50 posts and can post in the other forums.<br /><br />Generally nutmeg tends to be more MDA like whereas elemi oil tends to be more mescaline like. That is because the respective allylbenzenes are being converted into compounds analogous to mescaline and MDA.<br /><br />Look into the work of 69ron on herbs.maxforums for more comprehensive information on this subject.
