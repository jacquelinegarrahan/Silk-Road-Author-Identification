				dude, here you go. my friend fucked up doing this too, i didnt think anyone could but i guess it happens<br /><br />-the first section is if you want to withdraw bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet outside of SR, or any valid BTC address really (a valid btc address must be used, such asTyrEsmjGoqX...)<br /><br />-the second section is if you want to send your coins directly to another SR user (enter their username)<br /><br />

				No I dont want to withdraw the coins outside of sr I have a service that acts like a middle man while there waiting to be transferred in here my question is I know I write who I want to transfer them to but do I just put my normal name runwithscissors up the top as transferring from since its coming from my silk road account? and not my middle man account that I have while it waits to get transferred in here?

				Use your middleman account name, if that&#039;s the account you want to send it to.<br /><br />(Only the account name of the receiving account needs to be filled in)

				Sorry I dont think anyone understands I have to go to my account and then fill in the bottom section for someone Im giving coin to. What I want to know is the top section isn&#039;t bitblock and my numbers cause the money has been sent to s.r so do I just put my s.r name and my pin and they will get the money? :) thanks for helping

But for once and for all:<br /><br />You see three possibilities:<br /><br />1. To deposit coins, send them to this address:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(bladiebladiebla)<br /><br />You use this one to send coins to your SR account from a Bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />2. Withdraw Bitcoins:<br /><br />Fill in the Bitcoin wallet address you want to send coins to from your SR account.<br /><br />3. Send Bitcoins to another member:<br /><br />Use this to send Bitcoins from your account to another user/account.<br /><br />Hope this will do the trick.<br /><br />And if you like high quality pills for sharp prices, come by and look at our Vendor page :)

				You do not understand ONLY fill out the top section to send to external wallet <br /><br />The person you fill out on bottom line now it came from your account <br />top line WITHDRAW BITCOINS (OUTSIDE SR)<br /><br />bottom line SEND TO ANOTHER MEMBER(INSIDE sr) <br /><br />SIMPLE
