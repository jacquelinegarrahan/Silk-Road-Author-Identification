				You told somebody about this place, didn&#039;t you?<br /><br />Rule number one of fight club is:&nbsp; Don&#039;t talk about Silk Road. <br /><br />Rule number two of fight club is: Don&#039;t talk about Silk Road. <br /><br /><br /><br />My paranoid ass would still burn the address, but that&#039;s just me. Someone&#039;s probably fucking with you, you&#039;re probably okay, but probably not going to jail is not good enough for me.&nbsp; Straighten up and fly right, learn pgp, and either become a crypto-NSA-defeating badass or leave the party, no offense.

				You&#039;re on Facebook.&nbsp; &nbsp;That explains everything.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t sound non worrying.&nbsp; Even if a friend was just joking... him just writing you that message is bad.<br /><br />This goes for FB too I&#039;m sure:<br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/how-the-cops-watch-your-tweets-in-real-time/<br /><br />Don&#039;t understand why people still use that thing... especially people that have found their way here.

				Yeah... I mean I don&#039;t see how it cant be anyone but a vendor you used.&nbsp; One that you pissed off or something?<br /><br />This still doesn&#039;t change my opinion about FB though :)

				I have wondered about being on Facebook and using SR. I don&#039;t mention anything about SR on my Facebook, (I think maybe like a year ago before I was using it I did tell someone about it in a message, but that&#039;s it), however I still get a bit paranoid. I know this sounds ridiculous and totally a newbie thing to say, but I&#039;ve heard that Facebook can somehow &quot;see&quot; whatever else you have open while you&#039;re logged in. I&#039;ve wondered about this because I have noticed that sometimes it seems like the ads in FB will be catered to what I have open (I&#039;m sure it also takes into account your Google searches, etc.) I have searched on Google for Bitcoins and I think I accidentally even looked up the SR link that way before. Does make me a bit paranoid... that&#039;s why I at least never talk about my exact location on Facebook. Still...

				That&#039;s probably an overreaction. All a vendor really has is a name and an address- it&#039;s his word against yours. The legal system is actually pretty good about not letting LE cause you trouble if there isn&#039;t a good reason. That&#039;s not saying that your communications aren&#039;t still intercepted, but you&#039;ve gotta be aware that they need hard evidence to do anything. Facebook is a useful tool, and maintaining a presence is nothing out of the ordinary.

				Is the username you have on SR the same one you use for other internet activities?&nbsp; Or maybe when you created your PGP key you used your real email address, and they linked that to your FB account.&nbsp; That&#039;s about all I can think of.&nbsp; When I created my SR account, I made up a username that is completely unlike any other online alias I&#039;ve ever used.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that when I search for things on Amazon, or Google or whatever, I get targeted ads on some websites.&nbsp; I generally use the Tor browser for any drug related web surfing, not just SR and the SR forum.&nbsp; I think once I was looking at a website that had smoking accessories on clear net with my regular browser, and later that day I logged into Facebook and saw ads for glass pipes.&nbsp; It freaked me out, so I deleted my cookies on that computer, and then installed adblock plus to hopefully prevent that.

				Admittedly I use a somewhat similar username here in the forums, but I use a totally different username on SR and don&#039;t link my real email to anything.
