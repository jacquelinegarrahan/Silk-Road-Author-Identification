				5 month anniversary on road today and feel like its time to give back :)<br /><br />Hoping to get recognised as a reviewer here on the boards once I hit my 50 but in the mean time I wish to share some of my feedback to date and hopefully get some community input on what information they look for / want to see. <br /><br />i&#039;ve only skimmed the forums but havent yet found a standard product review template <br /><br />so I&#039;ve gone and done a draft including criteria I&#039;d love to see left idealy as buyer feedback but for now I&#039;ll be happy if this gets accepted by the forum community<br /><br />

				happy for others to use this when leaving feedback or reviewing their substance of choice on the board and hoping to offer this service once tested by community to potentially be used as a *verified* status for vendors looking to get rep up when they are starting out or looking to get a balanced rank on quality/service vs, sales/price...<br />
