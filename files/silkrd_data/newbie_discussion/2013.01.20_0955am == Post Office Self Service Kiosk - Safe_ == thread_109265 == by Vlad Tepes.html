				Someone mentioned this, or at least I read it on a thread I can&#039;t reply to atm. As some of you know, you can buy stamps at these self-service kiosks at certain post offices. The problem I see is that you can&#039;t pay with cash. Using a card, I don&#039;t know if this is true, but wouldn&#039;t it be very easy to link your card number/identity to the qr code or something the machine prints on the stamps. They only know you bought stamps...until LE gets their hands on a package you sent with one. My question here is does anyone know for a fact whether or not those stamps you can print for any amount are linked to the card you must use to buy them at the kiosk?

				Issue with the Self Service Kiosk<br /><br />Pros - <br />- Can use a visa/mastercard giftcard note traced to you / prepaid card.<br />-Very fast convenient to use, no irl interactions<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Has camera on the kiosk<br />

				That settles it for me. I&#039;m sure LE and the postal service could figure out more countermeasures at this point, but I&#039;d rather not make it so easy. I&#039;ll do it. I won&#039;t do it. I might do it. I&#039;m smart enough to do it. I&#039;m dumb enough to do it. It&#039;s possible. It&#039;s not. I know how, but I don&#039;t. Thanks for the info you asshole! You&#039;re a helpful jerk and I&#039;m partially serious.&nbsp; ;)

				Whilst on the subject can any UK users chime in on this.<br /><br />Royal Mail offers tracked services Recorded Signed For and NextDay Special Delivery, both require going into the post office which of course contain CCTV. I&#039;ve noticed some UK vendors do offer this. Wouldn&#039;t it be as simple as ordering something using this, LE checks tracker number in Royal Mail system to find out where and when it was posted, then check CCTV?<br /><br />Hardly a big effort required right?

				Move to the mountains and wear a ski mask. Or move to LA and make friends with some Hollywood makeup artists. Plastic surgery, terminator-like robots, carrier pigeons(hell no). Knowing I&#039;ve never been there, the UK seems like a police state to me. Cameras everywhere, no guns so they have problems with knives. <br /><br />OFF TOPIC:As an attacker I&#039;d rather stab my victim discreetly than shoot them. Don&#039;t bring a knife to a gun fight. As a victim, I&#039;d feel much more comfortable defending myself with a gun knowing both may have access and they call them the equalizer for a reason. I could try to rob an old lady and if she has her concealed gun in the right spot, and some other good preparation, I could easily be the dead one. Gun defense is easier to learn than knife fighting and a dude with pro knife skills can easily kill and fake trying to kill you with their movements. Easy learning curve evens the playing field. Guns are loud: advantage victim. I apologize for the tangent. I just don&#039;t get UK gun laws. Cultural differences maybe? Or perhaps the citizens used to shoot the cameras. I&#039;m pooped, so don&#039;t take what I said too seriously. I&#039;m not an expert on UK crime. What say you people?
