				Greeting SR, I recently purchased 50g of Speed paste from FASTWAYS, and I now have a pretty wet substance in my freezer.<br />I&#039;m not sure about the quality, but all I know is that in the place where I live, people dont have speed with the same quality.<br />What do I cut the paste up with, and how?<br />A friend of mine told me to use baby powder, it would dry it up, yet still leave the substance in the powder.<br />But what kind of amount should I do it with, and is it safe?<br />What is your experience in cutting up speed paste? <br />I want my paste in powder, and lower the purity, just for pure safety.<br /><br />Hope you can help, and this is my first post, sorry for my bad engrish.

				You should let it dry and try some before you decide to cut any yourself, just set it out room temp for a few hours or you can use a hair dryer to speed up the process, after its dry, try it report back the effects and I can advise further. <br /><br />I am interested in the pure potency I have some on the way, I had some from amsterdope but the people who tried it said they felt nothing which is hard to believe but I want to make sure fastways stuff is up to par, thanks

				Dont let it dry to much!<br />Put in some Pure Coffein Powder or u can use SchüsslerSalze or simple Placebos or Creatine,<br />i think the best is:<br />dont let it dry,<br />do it in the freezer for 1 day<br />after that cut it fast as possible with an mix of Coffein Powder &amp; Placebos.<br />The Powder and the Placebos take up the wet substance and you dont loss to much.<br />After this the best is to wait 2 weeks befor you sell this stuff, let it work. Dont do vacuum do it in a mbb bag and wait.<br /><br />I dont know why everybody said you should dry it?<br />The wet substance turns!!!!<br />Take a Pipete and do a small portion in you morning coffee,<br />you will have fun the whole day!!!
