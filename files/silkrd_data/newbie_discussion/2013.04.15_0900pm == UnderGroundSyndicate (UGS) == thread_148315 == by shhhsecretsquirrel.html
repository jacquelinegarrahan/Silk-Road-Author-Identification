				I know that there has been a lot of bitching after the massive market fluctuations with BTC the other day, but guess what? Everyone suffered. It sucked for you, it sucked for me, it sucked for vendors too. It&#039;s like the stock market, and with currency it&#039;s an even riskier game to play. Get over it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve read through some of these posts regarding UGS (UnderGroundSyndicate) and I don&#039;t know how there could be so many negative comments. In my experience, every transaction done with this seller has been irreproachable. The quality of the product is ALWAYS beyond excellent. I have never experienced these packaging issues that people are reporting--nothing but discrete, well done shipping on UGS&#039; part. In fact, my experiences with this seller have built absolute loyalty to them on my part--if given the option, I wouldn&#039;t even consider ordering through anyone else. <br /><br />Anyone complaining about ban lists is simply ignorant of the way the SR works--vendors have to have their security and assurances as much as buyers do and when there is a buyer out there ripping people off, endangering sellers or the community, or otherwise not following the rules (which should be pretty straightforward to anyone who can read and has half-a-brain), need to get bitch-slapped. Sure, the vendor could just blacklist the buyer--but that would not alert the SR community to a possible danger and someone else could get ripped off etc. <br /><br />What has been established here is an economy--and simply because it operates on the underground of the market, it doesn&#039;t mean that the same principles of economics are any different than in any other market. Operating in an anonymous environment requires additional methods and layers of trust to be built, and that&#039;s just the way it is if the market is to be protected. The only people who should be complaining about ban lists are the people who want to rip off sellers. If you aren&#039;t guilty, then why worry about it?<br /><br />UGS is, in my opinion, top-notch, and anyone who is worried about doing business with them because of the posts in this forum--DON&#039;T WORRY. UGS is fast, reliable, and, in the rare event that something did go wrong with your order, happy to make the situation right. People who don&#039;t get what they expect and rush to give a poor rating/review aren&#039;t following the proper channels--there is nothing wrong with contacting the seller if you think they did something wrong and, in my experience, most of them will be more than happy correct any errors made (which are usually just human mistakes, we all make them). <br /><br />I&#039;ve dealt with a number of sellers on the SR, and UGS is without a doubt, a professional, reliable seller. Anyone who says differently hasn&#039;t got a clue what they&#039;re talking about.<br />
