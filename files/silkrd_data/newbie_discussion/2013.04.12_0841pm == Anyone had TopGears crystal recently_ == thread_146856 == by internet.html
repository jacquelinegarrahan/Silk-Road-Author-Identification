				TopGear is a relatively new vendor--and up until yesterday, his stats and feedback were excellent. I personally know a few senior members who recommended his gear ... yet several people--including myself--have received either very weak or completely bunk meth &amp; coke in the last 24 - 48 hours. Frankly, I was shocked, as I wouldn&#039;t have expected this to happen given his reputation. From what I know, he strikes me as an honest vendor who values his customers. I believe that this was an oversight rather than intentional. I have sent him a PM and will update when I hear back. Until then, let&#039;s hold off on guesswork and condemning him.<br /><br />Also, when we receive a questionable product, it is best to leave our rating at 5/5 and contact the vendor. Issue a final score only after giving them a chance to explain and/or rectify the situation.<br /><br />In the meantime, here are a couple of threads and reviews to look at:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.msg1007660#msg1007660<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=134182.msg1007495#msg1007495<br /><br />--Dr. Jay

				My order arrived today. So far it&#039;s feeling legitimate, but I haven&#039;t thoroughly tested yet. Will post in the Meth Vendors thread about it when I get around to spamming to 50
