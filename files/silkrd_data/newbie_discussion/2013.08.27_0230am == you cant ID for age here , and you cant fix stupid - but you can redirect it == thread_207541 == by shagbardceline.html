				I was looking at a few threads in &quot;general discussion&quot; that I am not allowed to respond to - and some in <br />newbie that are older.&nbsp; <br />The common theme of several was that very young buyers do things that are either bad for their health, bad <br />for their future, bad for SR, bitcoin, or just bad for business. <br /><br />I am not going to fall into the trap of saying that young people should be somehow prevented from <br />transcending the law and shopping here the way that folks past some arbitrary age can.<br />It seems to be much simpler than what age. <br />I knew 13 year old girls that could raise&nbsp; a family and 35 year old men who cant start a savings account. Whatever dichotomy you use - ___&nbsp; enough to do drugs, _&nbsp; enough to understand privacy issues,<br />&nbsp;___&nbsp; enough to be street smart&nbsp; &nbsp; - <br />the operative word is not &quot;old&quot;<br /><br />So that fact that one can&#039;t &quot;ID&quot; ppl for age here is irrelevant. <br />But, I think a test can be devised to weed out people who are so dumb that they endanger the site.<br /><br />Like, maybe a flash game where you have&nbsp; pics of drugs, and then a pic of a strong-safe&nbsp; and a pic of a facebook profile. Anyone who drags the drugs to the facebook profile gets booted. <br /><br />Now - If we can&#039;t figure out a test that will weed out people so dumb that they will incriminate themselves and SR - then perhaps we can lessen the blowback. <br />if they are sooooo&nbsp; intoxicated ( or stupid) that they simply muuuust post to social meida about their new toys, get them to promise they will claim they got it from _______ <br />and name some fundamentalist closed minded religious organization that has tax shelters.<br />IE - i got this from the scientologists at a fair! or I got this from the Mamlukks on the last day of ramadan or I got this from - oh whats that right wing church that protests US veterans&#039; funerals if they are gay or had an abortion - you get the drift. <br />Or have them say that Anders Behring Breivik sold it to them. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
