				OIk, so here&#039;s my situation:<br /><br />Had trouble the past 2 weeks with bitinstant and finally found out that my state is no longer doing the whole bitinstant/zip zap thing.&nbsp; So i finally found a local bitcoin vendor and make a large-ish purchase bc my wif and i are moving and we wanted to order enough #4 H to last us through the road trip.<br /><br />Did our research and decided to go with Marlo&#039;s 3.5 for $550 plus fees and shipping. Well, we get home from buying bitcoin and find that Marlo has sold out.&nbsp; So we do our research and find that 10toes also offers 3.5g &quot;off the brick&quot; for $550 as well.<br /><br />So I review 10toes policy and reviews and feel comfortable enough to plave the order.<br /><br />Tonight i log on and recieve a message requesting me to FE bc this order is &quot;several times the size of my average $100 order&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I explained to the vendor that i have had trouble with btc, and that this order is to fill a not-so-common need for me (holding my wife and i over on a 36hr road trip).<br /><br />So, 10toes seems to be a stellar vendor with stellar stats, but FE is a huge no-no and generally a red flag.&nbsp; My gut instinct is that this should go ok, but want to kow if anyone has any advice either way. Thanks

				I&#039;d be very cautious. Never dealt with that vendor, so not sure. Seems like a lot to risk for a vendor you&#039;re unfamiliar with. The only way I&#039;ll FE is if it&#039;s a vendor I&#039;ve dealt with several times before, and am confident that he&#039;ll at least partially make it right if something goes wrong.<br /><br />Up to you though.

				Thanks for the input.&nbsp; Still awaiting reply to my message explaining my siotuation.&nbsp; His normal req for not FE are:<br />USA<br />10+ purchases and 0% refund rate.<br />25+ purchases and less than 5% refund rate.<br /><br />I have 11 purchases and have spent just over $!,100.

				NEVER FE for any vendor. There may be vendor&#039;s out there who are legitimate in what they do but on an Anonymous Market Place run on a Tor Hidden Service on the Hidden Web, don&#039;t take a risk that you don&#039;t have to take. Escrow is there for a reason so utilize it and save yourself the headache. There are plenty of vendor&#039;s who allow the use of Escrow. Just make sure you Finalize your order immediately upon receiving your order.&nbsp; :)

				It&#039;s a tough call.&nbsp; I did FE for my very first order, and I didn&#039;t get scammed (it was Freeway, btw, and he has some crazy strong H right now).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not recommending that you FE.&nbsp; Generally speaking, it IS a bad idea.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying, it&#039;s not ALWAYS a scam.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s just a vendor who&#039;s scared of getting ripped off themselves. <br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t ever want to FE again for anybody.&nbsp; Those days I spent waiting for Freeway&#039;s package -- not knowing if it was even coming, or if I&#039;d been scammed -- were some of the most stressful days of my life.&nbsp; I took a risk, and that time it paid off, but next time, I might not be so lucky.&nbsp; And even though it worked out fine with Freeway, the stress took a real toll on me, and I don&#039;t want to go through that again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry, I know this probably isn&#039;t very helpful.&nbsp; Thing is, this is really something you gotta decide for yourselves.&nbsp; Can you stand to lose the $550?&nbsp; Can you get a comparable deal from someone who doesn&#039;t require FE?&nbsp; Has anyone ever accused this vendor of scamming them in the past (search the forums)?&nbsp; Are there some solid, positive reviews from people who did FE with him?&nbsp; And does this vendor&#039;s reason for requiring FE make sense? <br /><br />Actually, come to think of it, 10toes&#039; reason DOESN&#039;T make sense.&nbsp; If he has a listing for 3.5 gm for $550, then it stands to reason that people order that listing all the time.&nbsp; So, clearly $550 is not an abnormally large order for him.&nbsp; If he has a $550 listing up, then people must order it with some frequency.<br /><br />Based on that logic, I&#039;d say don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Just judging by the prices on SR, $550 is definitely not an abnormally large order, so his reason for requiring FE doesn&#039;t add up.<br /><br />Also, what are your stats like?&nbsp; Would he have any reason to think you might scam him?

				Simple, DO NOT DO IT. <br />If he says &quot;I&#039;ve already put it in transit&quot;, tell him thank you and I&#039;ll finalize when it gets here. He&#039;ll tllyou it was ini his vendor page and you agreed to it when you ordered. If it&#039;s not a rip-off on his part, a couple of days should not be a problem. If he&#039;s really put it in transit, he should be willing to wait a couple of days. if not your money will be held for the time until resolution can begin. <br />If you order 3.5g and he sends you 1/2 g. he can claim he sent all of it to you and he&#039;ll have proof he sent it. You, being new, will be SOL. Admin will side with him and you&#039;ll be out screwed out of your money and everyone will blame you for FE. BTW, if he threatens you with blacklist if you don&#039;t, report him.<br /><br />Again..........DO NOT FE FOR ANYONE. If you do and nothing comes, you&#039;re fucked. SR will tell you there&#039;s nothing they can do, you shouldn&#039;t have FEd<br /><br />.<br />DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......DO NOT FE.......<br /><br /><br />Keep saying it until you&#039;ve got, it then do it.<br /><br />SR Admin. will tell you the same thing.<br /><br />There many vendors that do not require FE. Find one. <br />If necessary break up your order. Lots of money to lose if anything happens <br />When buyers quit doing it vendors will get the message and stop this practice.

				well, look at it from 10toes side. <br />you don&#039;t have really many orders and have only spent around 1k $ on the road. now you are trying to order H&nbsp; worth more than 5 times your usual amount from a vender you never bought from before. that looks a bit fishy when you have in mind that H-users are not the first people you think about when you hear &quot;trustworthy&quot; ;)<br /><br />no idea what you should do with the situation right now, i&#039;d probably look for another vender and contact him before making an order that much out of my usual modus operandi.<br /><br />cheers

				I normally buy 1-2g. I&#039;ve spend Leary $400 in one shot with Hatter. This really isn&#039;t that far put of the norm for me. I planned on grabbing a 3.5 from Marlo, but he sold out sometime between last night and this afternoon. My stats are flawless even if they are kind of short, but, again, I do meet 10toes req for not having to FE. I&#039;ve got 11 orders totaling over $1k. 10toes has flawless reviews and is a 1% vender. Nobody else offers a similar deal for a ball other than Marlo. Need this for a move.<br />Leaving wed and will be on road for 2+ days. Does anyone have any actual recent exp with 10toes&#039; gear and/FE policy?

				Yeah, the arguement that my average buy is $100 is crap, by I&#039;ve made some $300-$400 orders, Nd some for $5. I asked him to reconsider and ship using escrow, or release my funds so I can order elsewhere. <br /><br />Any suggestions on how to best spend &lt;$550 on gear that will get to me on NEast US by Wed? I&#039;m considering going with UGS, I&#039;ve heard his gear is actually fent, but it keeps my and the mrs happy reguardless. Pity he doesn&#039;t list a ball/3.5

				The problem is that this fucker is letting my $550 just siit on an order he does intend to fill. Will NOT return my messages, will NOT cancel the order so I can order with a vendor who knows how to fill an order and respects his potential customer&#039;s time and money. 10Toes has fucked me. I needed my shit by wed, now the wife and I will be spending 36 hrs in a car sick.<br /><br />If anyone talks to 10Toes, tell him to cancel my order and release my cash! This guy is holding my shit hostage bc I refuse to FE

				What&#039;d I say... &gt;:(&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />Sorry you&#039;re having the problem brother.&nbsp; &nbsp;:( <br />If this vendor was any kind of business man,&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; he would cancel the order and go on his way and let you go on yours. What&#039;s it going to cost him? I guess he&#039;s just proving to everyone what kind of person he is. If there&#039;s any justice in the world, he&#039;ll get dope sick one day and no one will help him out....&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br />If I could I would send you some and help you avoid what&#039;s coming.

				Tell him to either cancel your order or fill it without FE. Otherwise you have to wait four days to cancel it yourself.&nbsp; If he is not willing to do that it is not the sign of a vendor you could trust to FE.

				Well hell I bet you&#039;re glad you didn&#039;t F.E. Shady business practices, it&#039;s sad really. Why can&#039;t some vendors be more gracious? If you met the requirements for not having to F.E and he asked anyways, now that&#039;s a red flag. All you can do is hope that he stops being weird about it and cancels it or wait the four days out. Sorry about you&#039;re situation OP, vendor sounds like a dick.

				I&#039;ve never dealt with 10toes and now I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. He does have a pretty loyal following, I don&#039;t get what the fuck he&#039;s trying to prove by shitting on you like that. If your money is tight, maybe you can at least scrape together enough to score some Subs for you and the wife so your not snap, crackle n popping the whole ride.

				Thanks for all the kind words, everyone.&nbsp; Just an update: 10Toes FINALLY released my $ sometime last night (over 24 hours after I turned down his FE request).&nbsp; Sent a message, but I havent read it bc Im not interested in excuses or doing business with the dude again.&nbsp; So went with UGS bc I know what to expect and am hoping that his/her/their mystery shipping schedule alligns with the stars to get our gear here before we head out.&nbsp; <br /><br />In other news: A friend floated the wife and I a sleeve to work/hold us so the ride is enjoyable.&nbsp; So all in all, a stressful start to the week, but shit&#039;s looking up! (just keeping fingers crossed that our mail comes quickly! ;) )
