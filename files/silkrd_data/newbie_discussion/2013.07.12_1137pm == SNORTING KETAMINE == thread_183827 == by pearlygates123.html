				looking to purchase ketamine from a vendor on SR, have never done it but been reading about it and seeing videos on ketamine, I want to try special k to experience this potential psychedelic.<br /><br />I understand it can be dangerous in the sense of addiction, I have tryed opiates, alcohol, exstacy, pain killers etc and never found them satisfying, my conclusion is if you get addicted you are a slave to your own addiction, a weak individual will get hooked on anything<br /><br />Can anyone please give their first experiences with ketamine? give insights on use, experiences, dosage, if k hole is possible with snorting and how much? ive heard the great T. Mckenna speak about it and am interested and cautious, thank you

				I&#039;ve snorted Ketamine a few number of times, the rest of the hundreds of dozens of other times I chose the route of intramuscular injection.&nbsp; If you are an experienced Ketamine user you will understand why IM (intramuscular) is the only way to go.&nbsp; Usually the dosage for racemic for someone with no tolerance is 100mg, for the S isomer a dose of 50mg should induce a psychedelic trip.&nbsp; &nbsp;The trip on racemic for me feels very euphoric and drunk, while the trip on S-isomer is truly psychedelic, ego loss, you feel like you&#039;re on a roller coaster that is slow moving, and your limbs are dragged across the room.&nbsp; There is a usual after glow with Ketamine, but if you use it everyday or very often, it will become an addiction.&nbsp; I think I read somewhere that it acts on some of the receptors that opiates work on.&nbsp; I also think snorting ketamine is very stupid and habit forming.

				Ive only did it and snorted it when i did it. I agree that it was very euphoric and a drunkish/lit up kind of high. I took a big shot of captn and puked and still felt amazing and had a blast all night. Definently a psychedelic trip that was enjoyable as ever. I would do it again for sure ! there was an afterglow and I guess I can explain it as when you look from something to the next you definently get kind of streamers or something of the sort. hope this can help some.;

				I have only ever snorted it... a lot! But i don&#039;t like needles and so couldn&#039;t do that however I&#039;m well aware its the better way to do it.&nbsp; <br />Anyway you can certainly k-hole easily by snorting, its my go to drug of choice and can be habit forming although not physically adictive.<br />I would probably start with bumps of racemic and see how you get on, for a first timer a G goes a very long way! in fact a g would be good for 5 people with no tolerance for a good session.<br />My first k-hole was literally amazing a trip through time and space with visits at various scenes from my life which felt like an eternity but was actually about 30 mins!<br />It is easy going and at no point was i ever scared at all and nor was anyone I know.<br />IMO it is quite a solitary drug and I would advise doing with a few close friends in a comfortable setting, I would never go out socialising on it, mostly I prefer to do it on my own.<br />Have fun and hope this helps!

				All very interesting advice and experiences, I look forward to bumping a couple lines here and there to feel the effects of K on my body and where it takes me, re-dosing when it feels necessary. I read there is a kindling effect also, is this true (easier getting high the next time you consume) <br /><br />Ive never stuck a needle in my body for the purpose of getting high, its an unlikely route for me. If i can achieve the k hole while snorting im ok with that. The trip of a slow roller coaster seems like a pretty amazing feeling of euphoria.<br /><br />How is the comedown? after you decide you dont want anymore K is there any addictive feeling like say cocaine?

				I would say it gets harder to get high the next time you consume, in fact tolerance builds very rapidly if you do it everyday! Keep it to a once a week drug!<br /><br />You will feel a bit groggy for about 30 mins after the peak (strangely it feels like coming round from an anaesthetic&nbsp; :P)<br />No comedown after an hour or so, the next day you will be right as rain.&nbsp; No addictive feeling as with cocaine/mephedrone etc.<br /><br />happy tripping

				after product is all gone comedown is alright. just ride it out. I snorted a bit of klonopin to help knock me out as it was early in the morn.<br /><br />some good info. to add though, I did do a line and then my buddy when we were at a rave was like &quot;this is lame take me home&quot; lol...so after I bitched at him a bit for being a pussy especially after waiting to tell me after doing the first. I drove him home and drove back and had some slight visuals but everything was fine. made it safely :) You&#039;ll enjoy it. Ive only did it once like I said but I would do it again.
