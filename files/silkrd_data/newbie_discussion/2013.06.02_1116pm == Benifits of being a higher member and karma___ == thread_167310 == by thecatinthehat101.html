				Hi all being a fairly new member to the forums I think some of the newer members as well as myself were wondering exactly what are the benefits of say being a full member with a more seasoned reputation??? What is the benefit to having a higher positive karma number vs someone who doesn&#039;t???<br /><br />And what happens to a member who has a very large negative&nbsp; karma in contrast to a very low positive karma over an extended time?? <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />The CatInTheHat101

				i dont think any<br />a lot of people have been getting mass negative karma. i got 14 negs in a mintue lol<br />some people are just dicks and hit the button<br />i wouldnt put too much behind the karmas<br />i asked the same question as you when i started. i have found people with lots of - karma who seem to be really nice and have great posts that contribute a lot imo<br />theres a thread giving away postive karma somewhere around here.

				No point in Karma, because you can place negative or positive karma for any given reason.&nbsp; And being a more seasoned member just gets you noticed more and have (most of the time) a better reputation.&nbsp; Well known amongst the vendors and buyers because you haven&#039;t been scared off or scammed others on the forums.
