				So basically I made a transaction through bitinstant about two weeks ago which failed and they sent to the wrong address. I stopped thinking about it since I couldnt get my money back. About a week after that I changed my bitcoin address on my account. Then today I get an email that says my transaction was successful. I got excited and checked blockchain for my old address, and the money had just come in. <br /><br />I tried withdrawing money from that address to my account using my pin,&nbsp; but it said insufficient funds. Has anyone had this happen to them? Does my pin still work with that address, or is there another way to get ahold of that money? <br /><br />I will give bitinstant a miniscule amount of credit for finally getting money to me , though they fucked shit up when they got back to me the first time and this is 10 days later. <br /><br />Let me know if you&#039;ve been in a similar situation and what happened.

				The stupidest and unluckiest thing just happened to me. I was trying to get the bitcoins out of my old wallet address when I realized a bitcoin just came into my account. I was elated but had another transaction that I thought it was from. I didnt realize how the withdraw function worked so I tried withdrawing one btc from my old address and it sent the 1 that had just come into my account back to my old address. I now realize the withdraw function is not for other addresses but your own. not something thats very clear on the page but ill get over it. <br /><br />Please, If anyone knows how I could get that money I just sent to my old address back I would be very grateful and send you a few bitcents as thanks! I feel very stupid but also like a higher power is playing with me...<br />The blockchain says the money i just sent back was a unconfirmed transaction? whats that mean? <br /><br />Anyway HELP!
