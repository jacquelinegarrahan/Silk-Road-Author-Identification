				Title: <strong>Retroshare over Tor</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Getting Retroshare to work over Tor is far from trivial, however, uglier protocols have been hacked into functioning over Tor using things like onioncat and transparent proxies of various kinds.<br /><br />If a Retroshare network over Tor were offered for Onionlanders, would anyone be interested in playing around and experimenting with Retroshare?<br /><br />If onioncat or other hacks do not work, we can resort to using quicktun or another lightweight VPN tunnel that does work over Tor to encapslulate Retroshare.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with Retroshare, it is a decentralized friend-to-friend darknet that lets you use forums, email, chatrooms and podcasts without a centralized server of any kind.<br /><br />Recent releases of Retroshare are more stable, provide more features, and even have an internal DHT that lets you rediscover IP addresses of your friends if and when they change after being disconnected for awhile, such as during a thunderstorm, a services outage, having your internet disconnected after not paying your phone or cable bill or your computer breaking.<br /><br />Retroshare is designed in such a way that it expects relatively static IP addresses, as opposed to domain names, even dynamic domain names, so it may be necessary to use a lightweight VPN, or at least Tor IP spoofing so Retroshare is given a (fake) IP address.<br /><br />Retroshare does NOT support IPv6 addresses, making certain overlays impossible, and does NOT support SOCKS or HTTP proxies, much less remote DNS resolution, which is necessary for full Tor support.<br /><br />However, quicktun, openvpn and other VPN protocols can be a lot easier to get working over Tor, which permits Retroshare to have a static IPv4 address.<br /><br />So, would anyone be interested in participating in such a Retroshare-over-Tor network?
