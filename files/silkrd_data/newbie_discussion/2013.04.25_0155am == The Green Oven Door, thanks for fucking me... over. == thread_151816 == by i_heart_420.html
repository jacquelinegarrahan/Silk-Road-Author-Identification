				Here&#039;s how I do it:<br /><br />- Bitinstant to MtGox<br />- MtGox to a shared-send address on blockchain.info in a new throaway wallet.<br />- Create two more throwaway BCinfo wallets, and use the shared send feature to split it up and send to the two new ones<br />- Shared send from those two into my SR wallet.<br /><br />Yes, for 1k I end up paying about $20 extra in 0.5% fees for the shared send on BC, however that $20 is worth it for my own protection.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151816.msg1051087#msg1051087">Quote from: CrackerJackoBacko on April 25, 2013, 02:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ah, thank you for the info! since you seem to be coolk with questions, hope you dont mind another...do most people use something like bitinstant to go to mtgox,...then buy bitcoin...then send that directly to SR? doesnt that expose your personal info from mtgox?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
