				ok I don&#039;t get how the price on product listings work. Obviously it can&#039;t only be tied purely to BTC because if BTC prices nosedive, everybody would have a hey day. So how is this avoided? I prefer to view things on SR in USD so I see the money in my account fluctuate. probably wasn&#039;t crystal clear on my question but can somebody please shed some light on this for me? would be much appreciated.

				You can change it in your settings, click on account, then click on settings.<br /><br />Also with BTC fluctuations, when it goes up (most of the vendors prices go down, when it goes down, BTC prices go up)<br /><br />So it&#039;s basically the same for you, if you&#039;re buying coins at the times when you want ur drugs. Only time it will change is if you have coins sitting there, obviously then you&#039;re either gonna make a profit, or lose out, depending on which way the market goes<br /><br />Is that clear enough? I couldn&#039;t be bothered explainin it better tbh... lol

				I believe sellers can choose to hedge (bind) the price of their product to the dollar instead of the bitcoin, to avoid fluctuation. The value of the bitcoin on SR is based on the MtGox-rate - however, it&#039;s not completely accurate, and seems to be a little behind the actual rate.

				Yeah well, either way the vendor can set it to fluctuate or can have a set price (i&#039;m pretty sure)

Thank you! Can anybody else attest to it not mattering when I buy BTC if I quickly spend them? I don&#039;t think it matters if they&#039;re hella expensive cuz I believe at least some sellers &quot;hedge (bind),&quot; in northsouth&#039;s words, the set BTC price to the dollar value. In other words, if i want something on SR, is it a waste of my time for BTC prices to go down before getting BTC?

				As someone posted earlier in this thread if you are spending your coins the day you buy them it makes no difference, if however you buy when they are up (like today) and then leave them in your wallet and the price drops you lose out, simple.<br /><br />

				So, SR protects us from BTC fallout, in the event of a thermodynamically-inevitable &quot;crash&quot;?
