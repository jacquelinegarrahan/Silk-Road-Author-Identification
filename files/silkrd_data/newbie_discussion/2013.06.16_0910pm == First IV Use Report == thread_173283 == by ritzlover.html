				I haven&#039;t posted in several months, but thought I would share my first experience using a needle. FTR, I&#039;m not a newbie on Silkroad, but I don&#039;t use these forums for much other than occasional exchange of information. And I thought this information could be valuable to newbs out there, especially ones considering IV drug use. Because it&#039;s pointless to tell a drug user not to IV, period, when they ask for legitimate information pertinent to their health and safety. That&#039;s like telling a teenager simply not to have sex, and giving them no other information about how to prevent pregnancy and STDs. If they want to do it, they will probably find a way, like I did; and when they do, they need to know how to reduce their health risks as much as possible. Once they have the information, it&#039;s up to them to use it or not. The point is, that harm reduction information should be readily available and not withheld or ignored based on judgments of IV users. OK, enough rambling. My first shot.<br /><br />I had a ton of 28 gauge 1/2 cc insulin syringes for several months and no drugs, until I found some cocaine. Now, I followed some harm reduction techniques, and others I chose not to follow. This should NOT be read as a guideline for how to inject (there is a wealth of great information on all the harm reduction/needle exchange program websites out there) but rather as my personal experience. And those websites I studied diligently for several months before gathering the courage to try it. First, I took an average sized line of cocaine.&nbsp; The quality was not great, but enough to produce a good numbing effect on the gums. Then, I split it up into three sections. Why? Because I was scared. The thing I was most afraid of was accidentally doing too much, so I started very small and stayed there. I washed my hands. I took a clean metal spoon and poured a third of the line (about the size of a key bump) in the spoon. I took the 1/2 cc (very small) needle, inserted it into a brand new bottle of purified water (sterilized would have been better) and drew up 25 units of water. Then I squirted the water on the cocaine in the spoon and watched the cocaine dissolve. I stirred the mixture with the plunger (shouldn&#039;t have, it was no longer sterile since my hand touched it). There was no need to heat the mixture as cocaine dissolves readily in water. I cut the tip off a sterile Q-Tip and dropped it in the mixture. I wanted to use a Q-Tip tip because the fibers are tightly wound because I was deathly afraid of the cotton fever stories I&#039;d heard about. I took the tip of the needle, inserted it in the filter, and drew up the mixture. I accidentally scraped the tip of the needle against the spoon, so I squirted the mixture back out, capped the needle, and started with a new one. I drew correctly this time, not touching the tip to the spoon. Now I had my shot.<br /><br />&nbsp;I did NOT sterilize my skin with alcohol, as I should have. My veins are very hard to see, so I went in the bathroom because it&#039;s well-lit and used a leather belt as a tourniquet. The only vein I could really see with the tourniquet on and my fist clinched was the cephalic vein in my right and left arms, but especially the right. Even so, I chose not to use them at first, because I thought they weren&#039;t the &quot;right ones&quot;. Now, I&#039;ve never fucking watched a person inject before in my life other than in a medical setting. So I was really confused about which vein I should use. I thought I should use one closer to the middle of the underside of my elbow, and I faintly saw one and decided to try it. Well, I got about 3 millimeters away then got scared. I took a deep breathe, said fuck it, and gently pressed in where i thought the median cubital vein was. I guided the needle almost all the way in, and no blood was coming into the syringe. So, I pulled back on the plunger a bit, waiting to know that I registered--still nothing. I withdrew, took a deep breathe, and decided that maybe I should just use the cephalic vein I could actually see somewhat well. Smart move. I also thought to myself that this part of the process would be a lot easier if I were a guy, or a girl who actually lifted weights so my veins would show. I guided the needle in (almost no pain--a lot less pain than the shit your nose goes through when you snort it) and pulled back the plunger (which is NOT easy to do while simultaneously keeping the needle still), then got excited because I saw blood rush into the chamber. I gently eased down on the plunger and it easily went, all 25 units gone into the vein. (That&#039;s a very small amount). I slowly withdrew the needle and put pressure on the spot with a cotton ball.<br /><br />&nbsp;I felt a slight rush as I injected, then it slowly faded away as I smoked my cigarette--I knew I would not get high on this shot, because it was such a small amount and the quality wasn&#039;t great. I did the other two sections of the line I had split, separately, a clean needle and filter for each one, to make sure I had the technique down. Really, I was most excited that I actually was successful at IV&#039;ing myself for the first time, so that I could do it the right way when I was ready to do a real shot. Which I have chosen not to do as of yet. Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to disappoint you with an ending that didn&#039;t leave me flopping like a fish on the floor. Not that that&#039;s what I want. So, lessons learned: there isn&#039;t any &quot;right vein&quot; to use, as long as you don&#039;t use an artery; guys have it easier than girls; and my nonchalant attitude about the whole experience kind of worries me. It&#039;s like, yeah, I shot myself up three times last night, now I&#039;m gonna walk my dog and read the paper. I don&#039;t know, It&#039;s so hyped up. Maybe I&#039;ll keep you guys posted about any new experiences I have. I&#039;m really just a pothead on a daily basis, so I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll do this again in the near future. <br />Any questions, comments? Other first-time experiences? I&#039;d really like to hear from experienced IV&#039;ers. And hold the bigotry, please. Nothing I hate more than bigotry.

				I&#039;m a former IV user and I know it&#039;s hard as fuck for females in general to find a vein to begin with and honestly, stimulants aren&#039;t worth it to me.&nbsp; The rush feels gross; I liked IVing heroin, but nothing else; tried coke, meth, Oxy, Dilaudid, and Opana; Oxy was a waste and Opana and Dilaudid were alright but not worth the health risk of IVing pills sans wheel filter.<br /><br />It sounds to me like the amount you did was too small for the quality.&nbsp; May just be my experience but I don&#039;t really feel like IVing coke is fun or effective.&nbsp; I did a $5 bag once that I got on the street and thought I was going to die; not sure if it was astronomical quality or just my not doing cocaine too often, but it was gross and I have no desire to try it again.&nbsp; Again, personal experience/preference.

				Yeah it was a really random thing. The coke was there and I was bored. I wanted to get the technique down because yeah, I really just want to try IV opiates. And now I feel confident I can without screwing it up.&nbsp; but I&#039;m glad you mentioned the wheel filter because I&#039;m gonna need one of those. Better start shopping...
