				He likes sweets but doesnt eat well.&nbsp; He eats once a day, always has, since he has cancer and doesnt eat right and is losing weight, would it be a good idea to sneak him weed brownies, unknowingly ofcourse!?<br />I dont need him to get fubar but i do need him to get the munchies so his weight stabilizes.<br /><br />Yay or nay?

				please do not sneak your grandpa pot brownies .... it could be really scary for him.&nbsp; :( <br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />also, if he already eats mostly sweets and doesn&#039;t &quot;eat well&quot; i don&#039;t think the munchies from pot brownies are going to improve anything!&nbsp; he&#039;s just going to want to keep eating more sweets!

				Very sorry to hear about your grandpa, hatchetman666.<br /><br />I know how the elderly can be sometimes when discussing the possibility of trying something new, but perhaps print off some research into the effects of cannabis on cancer patients (in layman&#039;s terms if possible) and show him that it&#039;s not a &quot;devil drug&quot;. If he&#039;s suffering from cancer he may very well view things that have the potential to manage the pain and increase his appetite in a different light than he has before. Also let him know that there are various ways of using cannabis (vaping, eating, smoking, tinctures, THC pills etc.) and that he doesn&#039;t have to sit there with a joint in his hand! Perhaps he&#039;d be interested if he knew nobody else would find about it, something possible if he doesn&#039;t have to smoke it.<br /><br />As scout said though, don&#039;t sneak him anything. It&#039;s not right to do that to someone against their will, and he may very well end up very confused, angry and scared.<br /><br />Let him know the benefits of cannabis, perhaps show him one of the Rick Simpson documentaries about his hemp oil and how it can help fight cancer and he just may come around! His generation were exposed to a huge amount of negative government propaganda about cannabis and its effects, so he may simply be opposed to it because he doesn&#039;t understand the reality of it.<br /><br />Libertas

				I believe weed is being bred that only contains the cannabinoids that have medicinal benefit, and none of the ones that get you high. Find out if you can gain access to it.

				Thanx guys, this is something to ponder. I will be there for him if he needs it and/or comes to me for insight.

But definitely do not drug anyone against their will.
