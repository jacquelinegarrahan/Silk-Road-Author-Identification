				Im sorry and sad to say it but ii think it&#039;s end game for SR. I have always avoided making posts like this in the past but i am at the end of my patience. I know DPR is working hard etc, but tbh SR has always been a pain for me. It was the benchmark without doubt and also groundbreaking, but unfortunately it is flaky and unreliable. Very rarely do i get a good experience with the SR site as far as reliability and speed go, plus there have been issues with maintenance, and a few scandalous attacks such as image hacking and another update caused BTC accounts to be falsely credited plus numerous other extended downtimes that i am sure you can remember. <br /><br />While DPR is a true anarchist whom i hold in the highest regard he seems to be losing a battle. I respect the secrecy of the issues, i really do. It should be that way. I understand fully the issues of the operation and he is a true pioneer of the blackmarket and will forever have my utmost respect.<br />BMR never interested me It&#039;s ugly and seems half baked, but this is just my opinion, Some prefer Reddit over Facebook. I prefer SR over BMR.<br /><br />But now we have a new player, Atlantis. I don&#039;t know if you have looked yet but it seems a lot more user friendly than SR. It is only weeks old but seems to have a lot of the features i had hoped SR would have implemented over time are there already. The only noticeable addition to SR i have seen in recent months was an extra significant digit in your BTC account value.<br /><br />I really hope DPR gets on top of this, i am loyal to him/her/them, but i have a business to run and these downtimes have wasted too many opportunities for me. As it stands right now i am waiting to place a $15,000 order but am unable.<br /><br />Yes SR is the ebay for drugs but on an intermittent 28.8kbps dial up connection. Whereas Atlantis seems to be the real deal with ADSL speed. <br /><br />I&#039;m holding out for you DPR my brother, and God speed. But this will be your last chance

				Yes Jack n Hoff, this thread again. You didn&#039;t have to read it, i did not force you. Alas like me you must be bored. I am seeking some constructive comments on this issue and that is all..<br /><br />And thank you morganeverett for your input. Do you think this has a major effect? I was thinking this myself but not being a university graduate on the inner workings of Tor anm still looking for the answer.<br /><br />

				I do love the anarcho-capitalist elements on Silk Road but as of now the only advantage Silk Road has compared to Atlantis is the superior range of drugs as well as we here have the option to browse incognito. If the down time frequency doesn&#039;t get better I can see a lot of users switching to Atlantis as the range of products grows larger. The interface, I think, is also more appealing to most users.

				Having been to both Atlantis and BMR myself I can say that while it is true that the aforementioned sites are faster, I think SR is still a wee bit more reliable.<br /><br />I&#039;ve messaged BMR sellers and Atlantis sellers with the same questions I posed known quality vendors such as MDUK here (shoutout to you bro, you know what you&#039;re doing). While on SR, even though my account is new with no buyer stats (same as on the other sites) I&#039;ve had helpful information given to me and its made me feel like they want my business and they want to conduct their business in a legitimite way (yes its an illegal drug market....but what who says its illegal? the government? fuck that! these vendors run AS MUCH a legal business as a medical marijuana dispensary in Cali). In atlantis and BMR not only do I not&nbsp; get a response to the questions I ask but it seems as soon as they know that there is a new buyer wanting bulk they go into scam mode. The only replies I got was &quot;for such orders Atlantis/BMR fees will be too high for me. So I require you to FE coins straight into my wallet and I don&#039;t give out any tracking info&quot;.<br /><br />DPR and the SR community in general have done a LOT of work and have evolved beautifully from their inception. The other markets, while looking legit in their outset, I still am skeptical about them simply because of responses I&#039;ve gotten from non-SR vendors.<br /><br />I for one don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be taking my business anywhere but here and I hope people won&#039;t be too eager to jump ship<br /><br />The saying goes, &quot;Man has never learned from history, hence history always repeats itself.&quot; I think the more experienced members will remember incidents like ETM and/or other vendors/&quot;special sales&quot; that required people to jump on board and FE. The established members didn&#039;t jump on board. so how did they work? Because of this huge influx of new members who couldn&#039;t care to take a day out to go through some reviews and doing their research<br /><br />Thats why I PLEAD to everyone. Join WHICHEVER marketplace you want, it is a free world but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not jump on board start loading up your wallets without giving it some second thought.<br /><br />I hope this time the community will help the newbs, and even some established members see the light.<br /><br />As for DDoS. People always fear what they don&#039;t understand. And NO ONE understands why, even with such exposure in the mainstream media, clearnet etc HOW SilkRoad is working. Does that not speak VOLUMES of the time and effort that DPR and the rest of the crew put in behind the scenes?<br /><br />Just my 2 BTC

				Honestly, I think that has to do with the new markets such as Atlantis being relatively new rather than a systematic flaw within the market. The fees are lower which means it will grow over time simply because there is economic incentives for sellers to switch, or just expand, to these sites that offer better conditions. DPR is well aware of this and he&#039;ll have to ajust to this at a later point.

				Yeah thanks for those kind words. Like i said i have always avoided posting this kind of shit because i do understand the nature of the beast. I am worried about my BTC because it has been a hard slog accumulating them..The fact that atlantis has popped up recently is hard to ignore and yes i have not put funds in the account and i am still waiting on replies my self.<br /><br />It is great to hear your views, And i love how patriotic you guys are, it keeps it real and gives&nbsp; me a&nbsp; sense of security. <br /><br />I really do have a bromance with DPR and the SR crew. It&#039;s a pivotal time in our history, and winning the war has never been more in our favour, I love it.<br /><br />All good.....

Most certainly there are shill accounts and most certainly some people are doing everything they can to build up as much negativity as they can and build a propaganda (hmmmm sounds like government.....) however key word being SOME<br /><br />Most of the vendors here are the nicest people I&#039;ve met and honest to god I feel like part of a big family when I&#039;m here. There will always be SOME who try to ruin it for you. Unfortunately Society has always taught us that when it comes to bad things, the SOME represent the MAJORITY which is not true. I mean if a person REALLY is going to switch to Atlantis from SR cause he got scammed ONCE and that too cause he didnt do his due diligence then my friend he&#039;s going to go through the same things ten folds in Atlantis then in BMR and those kind of people the community is better without in the first place<br /><br />I do urge the majority of us however to NOT be deterred by small time scammers, shills, trolls and pointless DDoS attacks. You see when a man is down he has two options, he can either quit and give up and be a failure or he can see where he went wrong so that when he comes back he&#039;s stronger than ever<br /><br />Unfortunately, as I said the media and society has potrayed really fucked up things for a long long time. For example for me in Aussie land I&#039;ve seen so many people walking straight, see an Aboriginal and literally change the direction in which they&#039;re walking. Why? Well I saw on the news the other day that ALL and yes they said ALL aboriginals are into <br /><br />&nbsp;- drugs<br />&nbsp;- raping women of their own community<br />&nbsp;- known felons across generations<br />&nbsp;- unemployed<br /><br />The amount of importance hate and negativity is given in the world is UNBELIEVABLE. Since when were we taught that the silver lining is the whole cloud? apparently ever since we started watching Television and the media. Sad....<br /><br />Seriously WHATS wrong if an Aboriginal asks you for ciggarettes? or some change? if it is within my capacity I always give it to them. Still waiting for the world to turn upside down cause I gave 2 cigs to a noong or a I gave $2 to them and it baffles me how people can think any differently. Think about it iff you were a millionare today but tomorrow you were homeless, no money for clothes and food and you went to the station to ask for $5 and people spat on you (yes I&#039;ve seen noongs been spit on) how the fuck would YOU feel? Did we forget compassion? Did we forget consideration?

				Why are we portrayed as hapless junkies? This is seriously the most educated forum i have ever been a part of. The dogs are defo out there. Even in the free market the dogs managed to cause the &#039;GFC&#039;. It&#039;s no surprise to me that scammers are out there, At least here we are afforded the opportunity to be able to do our homework first. <br /><br />Out of all the transactions i&#039;ve made on SR there was only one time i was completely ripped by a vendor, <br /><br />This is all very brilliant, but the hard fact remains that we on SR are at this time bound by an unwanted clause in the contract fbeing DoS. How long will all the nay sayers hold out before they need to move to another premises?<br /><br />The incentives for change are there The risk takers will eventually discount the paranoia over Atlantis. It should not be swept under the carpet, this is real. The writing could be on the wall for DPR.<br /><br />I hope not, but the market WILL decide for itself.

				for sure competition is healthy. and visited BMR and Atlantis (not saying both are bad at all) BUT:<br /><br />as long as it&#039;s not been solved with SR being attacked and all other black markets ARE NOT, it cannot be said they have nothing to do with such attacks.

				first and foremost I&#039;d appreciate it if the Thread Starter and any current/future readers and subscribers to took the following suggestions into consideration<br /><br />&nbsp;- What (in my mind, at least) started as a troll thread has turned into a sensible discussion with facts being presented<br />&nbsp;- First and foremost. If the Thread Starter can simply change the position of the word &quot;will&quot; in their thread title will help immensely in reflecting the true nature of the thread. I think &quot;Will Atlantis rise from the depths and conquer all&quot; is more apt given the nature of this thread<br />&nbsp;- I encourage all to present cold hard facts and evidence as thatsall has done and STILL PLEASE only give your opinion and give others the right to form their own<br />&nbsp;- Anything not supported with evidence and/or verifiable facts shall be treated as hearsay and simply ignored<br />&nbsp;- Report ALL trollers and spammers in this thread. This is a sensible discussion among sensible people. Trolls can go to<br /><br />******CLEARNET WARNING*******<br /><br />4chan.org<br /><br />Most Importantly. I today Pledge to provide all my knowledge and skills to DPR at no cost to him and at every uncovenience to me to help him rebuild this site and in the future maintain this site. I Pledge that I will do whatever is in my power and&nbsp; &nbsp;whatever may be asked of me by DPR and of the SR staff and community to help in any which way. If others agree to do the same pm me and I&#039;ll start a thread and a petition to DPR pledging our lifelong support. In case any of you wonder why lifelong. I belong to (what used to be) a royal family of India and I knew of people working in my family whose generations had worked for our family because 100s of years ago their forefathers pledged undying lifelong service. I treat those people like my family. I consider them my blood. That is the highest honour and respect you can give anyone. Think about it. By creating this site has DPR not done the same to each and every one of you? Everyone has the capacity to take at least 30 minutes out of their day to help someone. I hope more people will join this pledge.<br /><br />The PM&#039;s I recieved from vendors in Atlantis - I messaged them all from a new account asking if they can do bulk order custom listings for me<br /><br />&quot;Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t do custom listing for less than $5000.<br />This because I&#039;m here to sell bulk, only I need a good reputation before I can start with most bulk orders.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hey there,<br /><br />As for shipping, you don&#039;t have to worry about that. You can understand I can&#039;t give you the exact details of packaging, but it includes heat seal foil packs and other methods, to guarantee dogs wont detect the packages. I have shipped bulk before, also to Australia. Currently my biggest bulk shipment was 22,000 pills, to Australia the biggest one was 9,000.<br /><br />If you want to order in such bulk I do ask you to not use the Atlantis system though, due to the very high fees that will come from it. I request you then send the pills directly to my wallet address. This saves out on transaction ánd withdrawal fees. I would otherwise request early finalization anyway so it shouldn&#039;t make any difference.<br /><br />Please let me know exactly what you want, I can obviously give you good discounts on bulk.<br /><br />Sincerely&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ok, I&#039;m going to get some heat seals after the holiday tomorrow.<br /><br />If you want to I can ship from Germany, only there will be some extra costs for driving to Germany.<br />The extra shipping costs will be $25.<br />The minimum is 250 pills.<br /><br />Belgium is also possible, but I have to ask $75 for the extra km&#039;s, and the minimum is 500 pills.<br /><br />I always ship packages with a maximum A4 size, because when I go bigger I have to fill in a big form with name and address + ID check.<br /><br />I know Australia is a hard-to-ship country.<br />But besides of that I only have had no package seized from the ~175. (he&#039;s been a seller less than a month....)<br />Other vendors might claim to have a 100% success rate or something, but no one other than me has it<br /><br />When you chose for shipment FE is required.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />We are the agents of change

				the Atlantis thing doesn&#039;t look right, touchthesky! trying to get around the corner to save the transaction fee is for sure immoral and points out the non-existence of a real community with trust in the system and the crew!! but you can find fiends on the road, too, that&#039;s for sure!! just walk around with open eyes and critical mind and you&#039;ll be fine! <br /><br />as this leads again to Altantis and their registration agreement... read it carefully before you consider to enter it! if you agree with these rules, then you&#039;re fine. if you feel there&#039;s something wrong or weird with it THEN DON&#039;T! but it&#039;s always up to you. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153419.msg1067826#msg1067826">Quote from: touchthesky on April 30, 2013, 10:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Most Importantly.

				Silky isn&#039;t that slow when it&#039;s up, and even when it is it makes me all nostalgic of the old dial up days.<br />Plus the Silky community is second to none. Atlantis is a good way to do in-escrow transactions while it&#039;s down, but we&#039;ll all be back riding the silky beast when she awakens :)

				in my opinion other markets will have to face the same problems as SR now does. But in future there&#039;s no chance to held up the revolution because it&#039;s a technical thing. Technology is changeable and will get changed. Attacks can slow things up, but when it&#039;s a TOR network architecture design flaw the attack is based on then TOR must be (and will get imho) modified to eliminate that threat.<br />

				The capitalist in me says that competition is good, although since the services aren&#039;t really the vendors it doesn&#039;t matter as much as if there were simply more vendors. What I will say is that if Atlantis doesn&#039;t get a large number of vendors, it won&#039;t be used by many, and if it doesn&#039;t see a lot of use, it won&#039;t get many vendors

				Yeah, a couple of SR vendors are moonlighting at the moment. I&#039;m just wondering about the vending acc./ fee. They are going to have -- actually probably passed that bridge by now -- an issue with it. A low fee will attract scammers and high fee will make anyone considering it wonder about how long Atlantis is going to stick around for.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
