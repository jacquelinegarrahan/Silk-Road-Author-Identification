				Someone in IRC asked me to register an account here and post a message for him. He said he was known as kmfkewm here. He wanted to say he was of course not involved in the downfall of SR despite the strange timing of his leaving. He also wanted to say that the day he left he got intelligence that the department of homeland security raided several people and were looking for information on him because they thought he was involved with SR, which is not the case. He also has intelligence that the FBI has the IP addresses of many servers used by DPR and that this forum will soon be under the complete control of the feds. He suggests a remaining member makes a new forum on a new server as a temporary meeting point, but not to allow illegal things to happen on the forum. Please post this in off topic for me.

				So a forum member has made a backup like suggested above. Like he said nothing illegal &amp; the operator has actually requested that no one post anything there unless this forum goes down. I&#039;ve already made an account there with the same handle as this one so if anything happens I&#039;ll see you all over there. Here is the link:<br /><br />http://6zyze2mkwyla7jwe.onion/silkroad/backup/<br /><br />I hope everything turns out well. I dont want to see DPR getting life or even years in prison if it&#039;s at all possible to avoid. Even if he did solicit the murders-for-hire, those people were rats &amp; potential risks to all of us. In any business there will be potential use for violence or wrong-doing once it gets big enough. He decreased the potential need for violence in the drug trade exponentially more than anyone else has done EVER, even law enforcement. He acted for the protection of all of us, so for that I hold the highest level of respect for him &amp; would like nothing more than to see him go free. <br /><br />#FreeDPR
