				Now you&#039;ve got a new way to safely liquidate your bitcoins. <br /><br />My goal is to be the highest volume mover of gold coins and bullion on silk road with the lowest prices that are competitive to retail. I&#039;m starting slow on here, but I&#039;m liquidating a multimillion dollar inventory with a continuous supply.<br /><br />Gold is forever. It does not tarnish or corrode unlike other precious metals used as bullion. There is a limited world supply that cannot be inflated or manipulated by any government. Its transaction is untraceable and its value is recognized and accepted everywhere in the world. For these reasons it has continued to gain value for thousands of years. The physical possession of gold is truly the safest, most liquid, and most recognized investment in the world.<br /><br />Since I&#039;m new here and just getting comfortable, I&#039;m asking all new buyers to make their first purchase no more than 1/10 ounce.<br /><br />srgold@tormail.org
