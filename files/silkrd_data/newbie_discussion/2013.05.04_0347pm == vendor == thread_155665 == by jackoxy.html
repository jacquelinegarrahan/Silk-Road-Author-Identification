				Oxy vendor (700+sales, feedback 100) for over a year now, new to the forum, just never bothered to write something so now I have to make&nbsp; the 50 posts.<br />Usually only on the forum to see what was wrong with the login, read about problems or the warning for scammers.<br />

				I&#039;ve been a vendor for 3 months and active in the last 2. I am in the process of racking up my 50 posts also, and I hope to do it productively. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 is the short version of my proposal. I think, especially vendors should pay attention to this. Obviously I can&#039;t post this in non-newbie forums yet but if I keep bumping this idea maybe I&#039;ll rack up my 50 posts and be able to post elsewhere in the forum less spammishly.<br /><br />I actually had registered my actual seller nick in this forum but I forgot the password (maybe lost it from my phone&#039;s password vault or something), which is irritating because I am one finalised order away from getting my bond back which means I could join the roundtable. It&#039;s not really the right time to be hassling SR administrators to fix up my lost password problem, so I won&#039;t. But if I can do anything to end this hiatus on SR sooner, I want to do what I can. A denial of service attack versus a creation of a rapid increase of Tor network capacity seems to me like the first step, as described in the post above.<br /><br />also, it&#039;s been pretty slack of me not to socialise a bit more with my fellow road travellers. It&#039;s pretty easy to get isolated when you are the kind of person that I am, a bit odd and at times difficult, long history of social exclusion and isolation. So I plan to become a regular poster here from now on. I really can&#039;t afford to have SR fall in a heap. I have backup plans for making a living now, but I&#039;d rather not relinquish the option of selling on SR, as I have dreams of owning a farm up in the mountains near where I live, and accumulating a nice stack of firerams and setting up a research laboratory for both physics research and pharmacology research. I don&#039;t really see myself achieving that goal teaching english to locals. SR really is the basket I&#039;ve put all my eggs into, so I better get to and stop letting it fall apart for want of what help and helpful solutions I may be able to offer.<br /><br />I am already now running a 15mbit symmetric non-exit tor relay, and I encourage everyone who can, here, to do the same.

				yeah, unfortunately i don&#039;t think i&#039;m gonna get much of my ideas read with the &#039;get to 50&#039; attitude most posters in this forum have. it is a kinda silly limitation really. posting 50 posts does not really prove anything. i&#039;d say the same thing should apply to the bond refunds, frankly. i have sold over 2000 worth of merch on SR, but i&#039;m at 29 orders finalised and i got my vendor account 3 months ago when 38 bitcoins was worth only 400. now it&#039;s worth well over 4000. it&#039;s driving me nuts because i could do so much to expand my offerings with that money. and make money for both me and DPR and co.

				yah, same boat, need 50 just to be able to respond to reviews of my product in rumor mill section, or talk about it. Then again I&#039;m not much of a talker, I spend most of my free time not on the computer chatting. It&#039;s almost summer so tieing flies for fishing is what I&#039;m focusing on.

				not to bitch but it is actually pretty strange that as a vendor for over a year with perfect score you need to have all those posts here.<br />Not much of a talker/chatter actually.<br />Just like to be able to react on the forum when something important comes up.
