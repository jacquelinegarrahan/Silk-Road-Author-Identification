				Brilliant newbie move of the month,..made about 7 purchases and had delivered to my present address, flawlessly, and decided to mix it up for security by having the latest delivered to my last address which I still receive junk mail on occasion, thinking it might still go thru,..even though,..I&#039;d made a change of address,..(go ahead and say it,.)&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor, being the most forgiving and cool person, PM&#039;s me stating that tracking stated it was &quot;undeliverable&quot;, and asked if I wanted a refund or to resend.&nbsp; I thanked them and asked to resend, offering to pay for any x-tra postage,.&nbsp; not knowing that the original package was then irretrievable by them. This awesome person sent another package,(no charge), and said if I could retrieve the first one, it was mine,..yeah, new vendor but still thought it was over the top accommodation,..havnt received 2nd ship. yet but recent ratings for this vendor are off the hook.&nbsp; I have began compensation for my error but wonder if I should attempt contacting Postal and try to retrieve the original,..greenhorn here,...open to sound advice,.....

				If you chose to contact USPS about your missing package, be sure that the vendor who sent it has VERY good stealth. <br /><br />Additionally, the type and quantity of drugs in the package will determine if you&#039;ll be TOTALLY fucked if you get a CD going to pick it up.<br /><br />Basically, if you feel safe that USPS has not found out about the drugs, you can probably go and get it.<br />But are the extra drugs worth your freedom?&nbsp; :-X
