				Well I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t vouch for any vendor in specific &#039;cause crack isn&#039;t my thing. But there sure is lots of it available from the US, Canada, Holland and Germany on here.

				Sorry to hijack your thread man, but my question does not deserve a new thread.<br /><br />Is the high from smoking crack comparable to IV/shooting up Cocaine HCL? I always IV coke and i was pretty sure that smoking Crack is very much like IVing Coke, just the high sets on slower and is not as intense. <br />When i had the chance to get an answer for this question, i always forgot to ask. So now the time has come to finally get an answer.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to whoever answers.<br /><br />Regards<br />Chubz101

				I&#039;ve tried Cocaine HCl before, but it was always throu the nose (snorted).<br /><br />What&#039;s the difference between snorting and smoking it? Is the effect really better?

				Even though still no one has answered my question if the high from smoking crack is comparable with smoking crack, here is what i do know:<br /><br />For smoking you need crack or freebase cocaine - you can not smoke HCL C. After you take the first hit of crack, about 5 to 20 seconds later you will get the most intense high (probably almost as good as IVing HCL Coke).&nbsp; Trying crack or IVing HCl coke are things everyone should have on their bucket list and try ONCE in their life. You need to experience this intense rush. But i would recommend rather wait till you are older/mature enough, with e a strong personality - so you will not get hooked.<br /><br /><br /><br />
