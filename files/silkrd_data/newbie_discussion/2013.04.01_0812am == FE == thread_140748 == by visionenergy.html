				Whats your FEing experiences?&nbsp; I Fe&#039;d one time and I got OG that looked like compressed brick weed.&nbsp; It was good, but I also didn&#039;t order OG.&nbsp; I ordered Cheese that cost a little more and when I told the vendor I didn&#039;t receive the right product he informed me he ran out and gave me a product of the same value.&nbsp; Then Why was it more expensive???&nbsp; Also the weight was just a little bit short of what I ordered...Not much, but damn...its weed.&nbsp; No need to be so stingy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whats your Fe story.

				I FE&#039;d because the vendor asked me to as it was my first ever SR order.&nbsp; The vendor has an extremely good reputation and has contacted me to say when the goods are being shipped.&nbsp; <br /><br />I realise I have put my money at risk by doing this and perhaps I should have done more research first but from looking at vendor reviews this seems to be fairly common practice when they are dealing with new users.&nbsp;

And the people that do know often don&#039;t spend the time to go back and change it.<br /><br />So don&#039;t rely on feedback comments for FE vendors.&nbsp; They werre most likely written after the buyer checked out and mean nothing.&nbsp; If a vendor has been scamming FE for a while, some of it may have hit his overall rating score, but that may not show up for a while because of the inaccuracy of the feedback.

				When checking the vendor&#039;s feedback, I was looking for feedback that was on goods actually received (and positive reports on the forums) rather than just FE feedback but yes, what you are saying is true. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d FE again, I was being just like a kid in a candy store after finding SR :)<br /><br />Fingers crossed my delivery will arrive without incident.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s good advice and one of the reasons I only placed a fairly small initial order. <br /><br />If it gets here and I&#039;m satisfied with the stealth, etc then I may go on to order again.

				I have only ever finalized early once and ended up being scammed but that was a year ago when I was a new member and was not too clued up on things.<br />Since then I have never had any bad experiences with orders, always have arrived and if they havn&#039;t Ive been refunded or had a reship arrive all good :)

				Yeah loads of barrier to newbs (such as having to contact sellers before bidding or having to FE). Better off building a reputation with trusted sellers. Then stay away from sellers who want FE.
