				so i used bitinstant twice this week, each time depositing $500 in cash via moneygram.&nbsp; the first time was tuesday, and it worked as expected and my bitcoins arrived about 2 hours later.&nbsp; then i deposited 500 again yesterday, but this time i recieved an email from them saying that theyve encountered some sort of problem processing my transaction and that they would be in contact with me about resolving the issue.&nbsp; i immediately emailed them back and asked if there was anything i could do to assist in settling up the transaction.&nbsp; i received no response.&nbsp; ive been exploring the new website trying to find a way to troubleshoot, but they do not have a phone number posted nor do they have any links or information on what to do in the event of a problem.&nbsp; it is very concerning that they are holding my funds and not making contact with me.<br /><br />furthermore, if i do get in contact with them somehow i may still run into problems because i used a made up name and phone number to make the deposit.&nbsp; i have enough bitcoins on my account to purchase a fake id in that name if need be.&nbsp; it is all such a huge hassle, i sure am glad the cash deposit cap is $500, if they were holding thousands i would be going berserk rightnow.&nbsp; in the future i will certainly be doing my business with a different exchange.<br /><br />anybody have suggestions of how to go about collecting my funds from bitinstant?&nbsp; anybody have a phone number for them?&nbsp; i welcome your thoughts and opinions.

				Wow that sucks. I use BI and have made several purchases from them. My coins always show up instantly.I did read somewhere on these posts that zip-zap was having issues. Maybe that&#039;s the problem.<br /><br />PLEASE KEEP US POSTED.

				yes please do let us know how this works out , sorry atm though but im sure they wont be wanting bad publicity floating around. and they must be dealing in so much money that $500 just wouldn&#039;t be worth it.

				I have money MIA too. I just figure the more I annoy them about it the more its gonna clog the support e mails. THis has happened to me before with them and I eventually got it. I know its hard but just be patient&nbsp; ;D

				Bitinstant is trustworthy, their customer service just sucks... fuck bitinstant.. you&#039;re going to be waiting up to a few more days to see your coin until they process the transaction. If your deposit was even 1 cent off it will fuck up their automated system.<br /><br />Forget bit instant, use bitcoin otc. You can do very large amounts with the trusted people there.

				You need to use the &quot;E Mail Us&quot; link on the support page. They should be in contact with you pretty soon after you do that. Don&#039;t worry, you should get your money eventually.

				my bitcoins were eventually delivered along with an apology for leaving me waiting.&nbsp; i had even changed my sr wallet address while my money was in limbo because i was paranoid late one night.&nbsp; bitinstant delivered my coins to my old wallet address and sr forwarded it to my new one without any hassle, i am very grateful.&nbsp; the old saying &quot;there is no honor amongst thieves&quot; clearly is not the case on silk road.&nbsp; &nbsp;and something good actually came out of this ordeal, if i had not experienced trouble with bitinstant then i may have never discovered blueskytraders and the truely excellent service that they provide for the bitcoin exchange community.

				From what I&#039;ve experienced, they definitely aren&#039;t in the business of scamming. They&#039;re notoriously slow with their support sometimes, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve *ever* heard of someone actually buying from them &amp; not eventually receiving their coins. They just aren&#039;t &quot;instant&quot; all of the time.

				BitInstant has nothing to do with the actual payment. That&#039;s on MoneyGram/ZipZap/The person working the counter. Did you get a payment confirmation email from ZipZap?

				Start posting around on bitcoin forums, once you do that they are real quick to get back to you.

				I was using them and it worked wonderfully and quickly.&nbsp; With the new website, it doesnt recognize my prior log-in and when I signed up for a new account, it said it couldnt verify my identity and wont let me use it.&nbsp; I am done with them which sucks because it was so easy.
