				I am in awe :) Any tips you guys can give a newbie are GREATLY appreciated! Specifically can anybody advise me on keeping my computer completely clean at all times? I am computer literate but I have never been one for anonymity on the internet and also lack knowledge in keeping my computer devoid of any evidence that I have ever accessed this site.<br /><br />Thanks in advance :)

				OK a few things to add to my post:<br /><br />1) I&#039;m not as naive as my OP makes me out to look.<br /><br />2) I won&#039;t be ordering anything for some time. I have been reading through a lot of posts on this forum (among other resources) and will continue to do my research until I am satisfied that I am as informed and educated as logistically possible on everything to do with this.<br /><br />3) I am genuinely in awe at this wonderful place and I am extremely excited at the possibilities it offers :)<br /><br />Finally I have a question regarding anonymity on the internet:<br /><br />Should I use TAILS and GNuPG encryption, what else would you recommend I use in order to maximize the protection I am providing myself in case of the worst happening? Can you recommend any other safeguards I can put in place? I&#039;m talking about, at the moment, purely the digital security side of the equation. I am not familiar with such concepts but I will learn (hopefully quicker with some of your help).<br /><br />Many thanks in advance again :)

				I&#039;d use PGP every time you have to give your address and avoid vendors with keys smaller than 2048bits because they&#039;re not really secure anymore (and also avoid vendors that don&#039;t use PGP). Use gpg4usb for PGP, it&#039;s really the best. <br />Don&#039;t finalize early (FE), it&#039;s not a security issue but you&#039;re way more likely to get scammed that way. You should encrypt your hard drive with truecrypt too, and keep any silkroad related documents encrypted.<br />TAILS is not necessary but it&#039;s safer than using TBB on windows or on other OSs, you don&#039;t absolutely have to use it but it&#039;s a lot better. If you want even more security, use whonix over linux.. It&#039;s more complicated than TAILS but even more secure. Forbid scripts globally on torbrowser is a good thing to do too.<br /><br />To optimize PGP and to use it anonymously, add the following to your gpg.conf file : <br />throw-keyid<br />trust-model always<br />utf8-strings<br />no-greeting<br />no-emit-version<br />no-comments<br />no-mdc-warning<br />armor
