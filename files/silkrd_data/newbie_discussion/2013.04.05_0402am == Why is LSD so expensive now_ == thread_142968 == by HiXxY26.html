				Didn&#039;t it use to be like $5 a hit back in the 90&#039;s? I think i&#039;m just going to order some 25i-NBOMe since it is a lot cheaper.

				LSD is so much better than those RC&#039;s though!&nbsp; Hopefully I can supply SR with high quality LSD at a more affordable price than it is currently being sold at.

				Well if we believe LE, the bust some time ago was still a major source of production, combined with an at best unchanging and likely increasing demand (more people afterall) pretty much means prices up.&nbsp; If you would even consider buying NBOME over LSD you should probably just do it.&nbsp; It looks like we have a potential new source on the road as well, so heres hoping his reviews come back in favor (possibly more if SirThomas can hook it up too =D)

				I love acid&nbsp; :) I have never tried any of the NBOMe but i have read some pretty good stuff about them. What&#039;s the lowest price anyone has seen for quality acid on the SR?

				The last time I ask my &quot;d&quot; for some lsd, I was told it was a white person drug and no one wants it.&nbsp; This coming from a tall lanky white dude so I&#039;m guessing with no demand the people that actually can get it will charge whatever they want because the 3 people that want it will pay whatever.&nbsp; As one of those three I can attest to paying north of $20 a hit in times of desperation during high school but it was totally worth it.&nbsp;
