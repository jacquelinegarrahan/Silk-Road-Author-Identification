				I see posts here and on reddit asking for help with PGP and I don&#039;t understand why. <br /><br />All you need to do is download a program (GPA), make some notepad files then do some copy and pasting. I admit I followed a tutorial but after that it is dead easy.<br /><br />PGP is just used to information (addresses) in messages yes? Or am I missing something...<br /><br />

				Some people online these days, even on the tor network, are not very computer literate because of how easy it is to find and access these days.<br />Also bear in mind some people on here are probably pretty fucking high 24/7.

				Not so simple for me to use on my Mac pc. I have downloaded GPG for Mac and can&#039;t figure out how I&#039;m suppose to use it while on SR. Any help would be appreciated very much as this is keeping me from ordering with some vendors. Thanks

I included my PGP key and when he messaged me back unencrypted I was a little disappointed but pleased that he had been able to read my message! Like you say I later realized my PGPing was pointless.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s a cross between poor computer literacy and high people then. <br /><br />And mac users.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to forget how bad a lot of people are with computers, like the other day when I showed my boss how to organise windows file by &#039;date modified&#039;.<br /><br />Ho ho ho.
