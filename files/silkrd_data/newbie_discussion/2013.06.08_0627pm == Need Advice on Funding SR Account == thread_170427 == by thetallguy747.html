				You have to first create a wallet address on the SR in case you have not already done so. You find how to do so by clicking on the account link up above (where it is also listed the amount of BTC you have - 0.0 now, naturally). You will find a button in the page that opens that will tell you that since you have not yet deposited any funds you have to create an address first. Simply click on that button and let it generate one.<br /><br />After you have the wallet address simply transfer the BTC from Pecunix to that wallet address (beware of not mistaking! copy &amp; paste to be sure). Done.<br /><br />P.S: It will take a little while before the funds are deposited, so don&#039;t panic. You can search on blockchain.info about your transaction by looking for the SR wallet address. Usually it takes about 6 confirmations before the funds are transferred.

				The only button I find is the one that says &quot;Click here to make a deposit.&quot;&nbsp; Is that the button that generates my wallet address?&nbsp; Then I take that address to Pecunix and use it for the transfer?<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				Yep, that&#039;s the button. You click there and it will generate a wallet (a very long alphanumeric string). You will have to wait a little (it depends; sometimes it is very fast, sometimes it takes almost a minute).<br /><br />Then yes, you take that address to transfer the funds from Pecunix (I never used Pecunix so I don&#039;t know how it works there specifically but it&#039;s usually always the same, somewhere it asks for a wallet address to transfer the funds on, and there it&#039;s the place you have to put the wallet address you generated before).

				Your advice had been helpful so far and I appreciate it.&nbsp; However, when I go to my Pecunix account it wants an actual email address to send the payment to.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can that be done somehow in order to make a deposit into my SR account?<br /><br />Thanks again.

				I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t know how Pecunix works.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why it asks you for an e-mail, didn&#039;t you already found the account there? The only thing needed should be where to transfer the BTC now, and an e-mail has nothing to do with it (until maybe there is a way there to associate the wallet with an e-mail and for this it asks for that).<br /><br />I fear that if you don&#039;t find a way on your own you have to wait for someone that knows about Pecunix how it works because I never used it. Maybe start another thread asking about this specifically (something like How to tranfer BTC from Pecunix to SR address?). It shouldn&#039;t be too difficult anyway; there&#039;s a forum there or someone you can ask? You have the wallet it shouldn&#039;t be too difficult to find how to transfer founds using it if you search a little (as in a FAQ there or an help).

				I&#039;ll do some more investigating and if I still can&#039;t solve it I&#039;ll post under a thread title like you suggested.<br /><br />Hey, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions!
