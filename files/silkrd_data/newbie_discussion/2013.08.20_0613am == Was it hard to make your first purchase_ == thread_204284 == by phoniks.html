				I have everything ready to go. All i need to do now is to just place the order, but it&#039;s my first one and i&#039;m a little apprehensive about it. I have done everything i can to reduce risk, but i can&#039;t control the postal system and lady luck!

				Ordering is easy. Just be sure the address is real and correct. And, watch out for deals that seem too good or FE requests from any but very reliable vendors with lots of transactions and lots of recent great feedback.

				It is very nerve racking, but after you see how easy and without worry it was you will laugh the whole time your getting high! I have over 75 purchases on my buyer account, all domestic, all perfect, now international, that is a whole other ballgame. Being a vendor helps with all the purchasing,obtaining BTC, etc. This place really kicks ass, its so nice not having to cop off the streetsanymore! DPR ~~I LOVE YOU~~~ :-*

				It&#039;s basically very simple, but was a bit nervous as I&#039;m slightly paranoid and tried to make sure I haven&#039;t leaked any information.
