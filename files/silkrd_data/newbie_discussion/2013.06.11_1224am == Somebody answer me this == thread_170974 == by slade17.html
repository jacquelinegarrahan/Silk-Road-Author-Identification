				I&#039;ve been curious since I discovered the site. What stops an officer of the law from creating a sellers account and arresting people who try to buy from them?

				Probably, or generally /care if you are not in the US. <br /><br />I suppose the reputation system also helps in this regard - to gain feedback you need to make a lot of transactions with happy customers. Luckily i&#039;m not in the US, but it would require such an operative to send good quality illicit narcotics to gain a serious customer base. I reckon that would be illegal to do as a means of research in most jurisdictions.

				I suppose they want the Whale not the fish...for the time and effort to get a few buyers and not the sellers, it wouldn&#039;t even look good on them to bother with that would it?<br />

				They may to try and buy domestically to get to vendors. Selling would seem to be a big waste of time in any case.<br /><br />Downside for LE is that most trade is international, and getting to someone selling some pot from morocco (or any other far away country) would be quite an ordeal to catch somtething relatively small. <br /><br />

				they want the sellers not the buyers.&nbsp; And would be a tough case to win if buyer has decent legal counsel, good entrapment defense

				Has US enforcement fallen to the point where they want to get to the end user?<br /><br />As i&#039;m in the netherlands i can understand why police would want to get their hands on a large scale online drug vendor, but just some individual user seems to be far fetched. I guess its something i simply cannot get my head wrapped around though.<br /><br />Sure. people are arrested for selling drugs here too, but very rarely for possession or purchase of amounts that are so small they are likely for personal use. This goes for cannabis, but also for substances like cocaine or heroin. If you get caught here with half a gram of heroin on you the drugs would most likely be confiscated, but conviction for possession of such small amounts is very rare.

				These days I wouldn&#039;t put it past them. There was that story where the FBI seized some kiddy porn site, then continued to operate it for some period of time in order to nab subscribers. But in this case, right, they&#039;d have to get some good buyer base, and even then if it&#039;s small quantities it seems like it would be a waste. They&#039;d want the big suppliers I would think, and I doubt anyone is going to just start buying kilos off some new person they have no relationship with and no history.

				That&#039;s why you always order to a clean address with nothing incriminating around. If they send you something and do a CD, you deny.&nbsp; If they get a warrant, there&#039;s nothing to find.<br /><br />Done.
