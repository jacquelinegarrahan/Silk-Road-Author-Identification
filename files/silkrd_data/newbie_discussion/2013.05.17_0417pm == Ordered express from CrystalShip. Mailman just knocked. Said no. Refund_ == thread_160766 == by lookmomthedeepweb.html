				I of course refused to sign and told him to return to sender. If CrystalShip forgot to waive the signature, who ends up paying for this item? After reading the several posts about people getting busted for CD I said fuck that.

				Question number 1. Did they ask you to sign?<br />Question number 2. Why did you answer the door?<br /><br />My usps deliveryman has knocked almost for every package that I got sent from silk road. I just don&#039;t answer then they leave it in mailbox. If they asked you to sign then yes you were right for rejecting. If there was no sig required you returned a package to sender. Which is not a real address. Now making your package compromised. Plus, it has your name and address on it. It would have been really dumb if you did that. But, either way no refund unless their vendor page states that in case of non delivery( which you have to show proof) you would get a refund. Sounds like you fucked up.

				Dude, this is my new vendor account. I am working up the first 50 posts and not spamming posts so I can access and post on the other threads. So, no I am not new. If the vendor forgot to waive the signature than you still returned a package to the return address with your name on it. If it was a CD then you did the right. But, you would probably only get a cd if you bought a lot. If the vendor fucked up you can get a refund as long as you did not finalize early. Other wise never answer the door. Were you expecting the package the day the delivery occurred or did it take a few days.
