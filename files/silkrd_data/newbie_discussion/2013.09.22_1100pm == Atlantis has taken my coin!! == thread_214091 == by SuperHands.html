				Well this is odd, yesterday I had sent a message to the admin at Atlantis expressing my distaste for them running with my coin.<br /><br />I just logged in and some coin has been returned to my account?? 0.08 BTC to be exact when I should have around 4.5<br /><br />What is going on over there...

				why would anyone ever use atlantis...or anything aside from silk road? &quot;don&#039;t fix what isn&#039;t broken&quot; - silk road works like a charm, and has always been far better than it&#039;s competitors in every aspect.<br /><br />i&#039;m not surprised at all people are losing their coins to these marketplaces. and honestly, you deserve to.

				Yeah, looks like they&#039;re going to run with the money. Just wish they&#039;d had the decency to disappear quickly instead of this drawn-out, torturous bullshit pretending they&#039;re letting people withdraw.<br />Oh well.<br />Greetings, fellow refugees.<br />As far as why ATL when SR exists, vendor account price was cheaper. No idea why buyers were there, though.
