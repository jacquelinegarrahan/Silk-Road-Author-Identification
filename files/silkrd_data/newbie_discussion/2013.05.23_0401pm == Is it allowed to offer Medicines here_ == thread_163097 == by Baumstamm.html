				By &#039;offer&#039; I presume you mean sell and as long as you have a vendor account I&#039;m sure you can sell any medicine you want here.<br /><br />What&#039;s it used for?

				Sorry didn&#039;t recognise the generic name. Ritalin of course I know and it seems to be very popular here but you definitely won&#039;t be allowed to sell it without a vendor account. They&#039;re understandably pretty strict about that.

				Sorry, no, you absolutely cannot sell anything here without a vendor account.&nbsp; However, keep in mind that the vendor bond is refunded after certain conditions have been met.

				Yes i know, that the vendor bond is refunded after 30 sales or something like this. But i&#039;m a bit sceptical because as far as i know the bond is more than 3BTC and that&#039;s a lot of money. <br />And for example the prices for methylphenidat here are astronomical (round about 1BTC/100€ for 200mg MPH) if i sell them on the street i get 20-30€ for it :o
