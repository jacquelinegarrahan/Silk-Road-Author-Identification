				Alcohol &amp; cocaine.<br /><br />I have read that technically this combination is dangerous but anecdotally everyone combines the two in excess without OD.&nbsp; Right?<br /><br />Not my favorite combo but a very useful one is a couple beers and 1mg of Xanax.&nbsp; This will knock me the fuck out for nine hours with zero hangover.&nbsp; Can be quite refreshing if needed.&nbsp; I have found this to be much more potent if you take the benzo first, then have the drinks.&nbsp; Many times I have one beer and am not nodding at all.&nbsp; Then I pour the second beer and pass the fuck out halfway down the glass lol.<br /><br />To be clear, 1, 2, or maybe 3 drinks and a low benzo dose is safe in my understanding.&nbsp; But combining these in larger doses is definitely risky.

				I may be a noob on SR, but I&#039;m not a noob at getting higher than fuck.&nbsp; the real drugs aren&#039;t even called drugs.&nbsp; they call them medicines.&nbsp; Ayahuasca and Peyote&nbsp; -&nbsp; they put everything else in the universe to the status of pointlessness.&nbsp; the reason why everyone does drugs is because they can faintly recollect mankind&#039;s ancient history, and our recent over 10,000 year old relationship with these two substances... ayahuasca cures drug addictions because it trumps them, it gets you higher than balls drags you across the universe by snarling wild horses transforming into pumas.&nbsp; you did acid before, but you weren&#039;t ready for the real one.&nbsp; that and aliens are coming and putting the most mind blowing gizmos in your hand and god is like hear me my son jesus, and you are like vibrating at 1,000,000 volts taking in the whole tree of life.&nbsp; the rainforest people say that ayahuasca is literally our ancestor, that we evolved from the vine.&nbsp; we are children of the plants.&nbsp; and the medicine culture around it is beautiful, I was fortunate enough to be invited into some ceremonies with the rainforest people and santo daime and another group.&nbsp; basically a 40 person circle of the hottest babes cleanest holiest babes you could imagine, singing at the holy whim of their soul all night.&nbsp; icaros and can&#039;t recommend the experience enough, its not a drug its a culture, its a cultural experience.&nbsp; go out to hawaii and find ceremonies too I been to em out there.&nbsp; its like bests thing that ever happened.&nbsp; I smoked dmt like over 100 times making contact with alien angel energy beings and getting higher than holy fuck.&nbsp; that&#039;s how I got into ayahuasca.&nbsp; good ayahuasca is like DMT for 8 hours straight.&nbsp; you only puke and shit yourself until you&#039;re done with your fear.&nbsp; when you&#039;ve surrendered to the only worthy thing, love, you won&#039;t puke anymore or shit. just channel infinite amounts of unbelievable energy and touch the face of god.&nbsp; that&#039;s what it feels like anyway.&nbsp; its undeniable when you have the experience actually.&nbsp; outsiders hearing this stuff are probably like &quot;what a loony&quot;&nbsp; that&#039;s just the nature of the experience.&nbsp; they&#039;ve been staying healthy physically and mentally and emotionally with it for over 10,000 years they say, maybe forever.&nbsp; nobody in science knows exactly how they figured out the concoctions.&nbsp; (trial and error i guess)&nbsp; they say the plants told them.<br /><br />I like mescaline in all cacti forms too, so did walt disney and he took over the world through fairy tales.&nbsp; jim morrison, meh.&nbsp; aldous huxley.&nbsp; and the rest of the pranksters... yada yada<br /><br />everyone on here says peyote is so rare and hard to come by, they must not be native american, I see peyote everytime I visit my relatives sometimes huge huge bags full of it.&nbsp; they get it from texas through the DEA.<br /><br />anyway, good question.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done every drug numerous times.&nbsp; I like them all.&nbsp; but at this point all I really care to stock up on is mescaline, and a peyote connection outside the DEA would be great too, cuz they regulate it hard, you have to account for your ceremonies etc. but SR doesn&#039;t even offer these things?&nbsp; wtf?&nbsp; i thought this was the place you could get any drug?<br /><br />anyway, I need to build my reputation I could make a killing on here with the medicine I make.&nbsp; its just I never sold my medicine, cuz the earth gives it to me freely.&nbsp; I make potions from trichocereus pachanoi and peruvianus.&nbsp; which I am abundant in.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;but its all legal if you&#039;re native american, i feel sorry for anyone who can&#039;t partake of holy sacraments legally.&nbsp; i would write my congressman.&nbsp; peyote grows fast if you graft it, that&#039;s what my friends do, they say it works great.&nbsp; <br /><br />you could all have all the peyote you could imagine in no time with the right heads on it, and declare a white man&#039;s peyote religion and do it all openly without harrassment.&nbsp; religious equality right?&nbsp; the creator will bless you if you have righteous desires, and peyote is a righteous desire.&nbsp; so is ayahuasca.&nbsp; <br /><br />and holy shit you guys charge ridiculous amounts for EVERYTHING.&nbsp; a .1 gram hit of dmt is .46 btc $40?&nbsp; damnnnnn you could make alot of money like that seeing how it costs like $150 to make 7 grams = 70 very large hits so like $3 a .1 gram ?&nbsp; good numbers people.&nbsp; I am broke, I could sell mine for half that and get rich in a few months. <br /><br />i&#039;m sure I have alot to learn from you folks too, <br /><br />its just everything here is illegal, I&#039;d rather stay safe with myself, I&#039;ve been to jail and it sucks<br /><br />... but... an ounce of cocaine looks pretty tempting.&nbsp; so does an ounce of hash&nbsp; dannnnngg...I&#039;ve been doing vipassana, and now i&#039;m in wyoming.&nbsp; weird place to be after LA.&nbsp; I need that hash and cocaine I live in the middle of nowhere now.&nbsp; my indian friends would shit bricks.&nbsp; we&#039;d be rolling on the floor laughing if I got an ounce of that shit out here, we just don&#039;t see that shit anytime anywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />wyoming!&nbsp; like per capita 1/1,000 people in wyoming have even seen herb, and that means just one person in wyoming, cuz the population is 1,000 and that one person is ME!&nbsp; yeah its bad here.&nbsp; I gotta take care of a ranch though my white grandparents are losing everything unless I make hay this year and they say they&#039;ll leave 3,000 acres to me if I sacrifice the next 10 years..&nbsp; don&#039;t even suggest growing pot, wyoming will butcher my ass.<br /><br />but yeah, I need to build a reputation on here, so maybe I&#039;ll import some bitcoins anybody give me a real good bro deal on something let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;m a broke ass I need to make money not spend it though<br /><br />anyway, I appreciate what yall are doing on this front anyway, I&#039;m with ron paul all the way, my ancestors were crow, choctaw, and cherokee indians and on the other side they were american revolutionaries, scottish and irish and english badasses that shaped the country.&nbsp; and swiss too.&nbsp; I&#039;m a fucking mystery even to myself being from all those early american people..&nbsp; and its always been about the free market economy,&nbsp; all the rules and regulations and bullshit are a headache for mankind, its like slaves run the country now wanting more rules on themselves.&nbsp; fuck that<br /><br />&nbsp;and in this regard, (SR) its out of the governments hands nobody can stop the real shit that&#039;s coming, anonymous has a vendetta. <br /><br />we just need lots of education for how to safely approach these substances, cuz I don&#039;t want my little brother ODing on heroin.&nbsp; education not regulation!&nbsp; the dawn of the new age is coming!&nbsp; yeah muchos gracias amigos.&nbsp; this is impressive<br /><br />anybody want to help my broke ass out 1JrpTYDogiMZn9B8iZ87ae1pSvNFXkfd71&nbsp; I think I have like 0.299 btc&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m just starting<br /><br />if I get any random donations I&#039;ll fuckin party

				I don&#039;t know about favorites because I haven&#039;t really tried everything, but I definitely agree with the consensus -- weed + tripping =win. <br /><br />I just recently had mescaline and weed and it was a nice little escape from the norm. It was at a friend of friends house, we all went to highschool together and haven&#039;t seen each other since highschool. This dude named Tony was there and I haven&#039;t seen him since graduation night which was like 8 years ago. He pulled me aside and asked &quot;Hey are you driving?&quot; &quot;Nope!&quot; &quot;Wanna do some mescaline?&quot; &quot;Fuck yeah dude!&quot; <br /><br />My friend who brought me also brought food, steaks, so I was cooking and tripping and it was melting together. When I got home I layed on the floor staring at the carpet which was basically just coral reef to me at that time. The stars looked really bright and amazing on it too.

I know you&#039;re serious but that made me laugh dude, that&#039;s like one of the best sentences I&#039;ve ever read. I&#039;m a writer, do you mind if I use this some time? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I like mescaline in all cacti forms too, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br /><br />Funny, I was writing about mescaline at the same time you were. Maybe the universe is trying to tell us something?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">everyone on here says peyote is so rare and hard to come by, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Yeah I was just searching for mescaline like an hour ago and there is nothing, which surprises me with the abundance of everything else. Have you had salvia? Let me tell you... that&#039;s a strong, terrifying trip. Like with mescaline and dmt (from what I&#039;ve heard) you get this benevolent feeling. Like the aliens/angels/gods whatever you&#039;re feeling and seeing WANT you there. But Salvia is different. You do it at high doses and you basically just stepped into the door of something elses dimension and it does NOT want you there. It&#039;s scary. Low does make people all giggly and that&#039;s what it&#039;s known for, but high doses are terrifying, encounters that feel like death. But it feels really amazing to come back and know your okay and everything is going to be alright. Thats what makes it worth it.&nbsp;

				GHB + weed. So happy and comfortable and the sex is amazing!<br /><br />MDMA + 2C-B. The muscular contractions feel like a whole-body orgasm. <br /><br />Looking forward to trying LSD and MDMA this summer. It has been many years since I&#039;ve been able to get LSD so I hadn&#039;t had a chance to try this legendary combo until now. Viva la SR!

Lots of weed, because the speed kills the weed high pretty quickly.<br />Gives a good head rush and a weed high, but with the amphetamine effects. A very awake, alert weed high / stoned feeling.

				I like a mixture of LSD, Ayhuasca, Mescaline, and Shrooms, and then Freebase DMT when the peak of all trips overlap.<br />
