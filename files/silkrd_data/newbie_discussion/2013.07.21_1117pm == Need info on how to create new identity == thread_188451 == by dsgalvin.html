				I remember a while back I heard of a guy who delivered a baby that was stillborn, and he never reported its death or anything. So it had a viable birth certificate, social security number, etc, and he just used that after a certain point at which it wouldn&#039;t be noticeable (i.e. when the fake person is 5 and you&#039;re 25 it&#039;d be bad, but when he&#039;s 30 and you&#039;re 50 you could probably pull it off if you aged well)...<br /><br />I dunno how he avoided getting caught when the &#039;kid&#039; never showed up for school or got his immunizations, though.
