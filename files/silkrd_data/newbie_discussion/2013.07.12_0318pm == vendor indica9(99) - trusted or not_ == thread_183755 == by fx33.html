				Hi.<br />I&#039;m 1.5 years buyer on SR, and the first time I faced such obvious deception.<br />There were many cases that orders didn&#039;t come to me. But such deception - first time.<br /><br />I want to buy good quality LSD, and I serach the vendor indica9(99) with good repputation on LSD-avengers. I done order that include the post tracking number. In compliance with vendor rules I was finalized early the order. And for now moment, 11 days passed, the seller didn&#039;t issue me the number. And he is ignoring my messages 10 days.<br /><br />And now I&#039;m afraid swith my feedback to 1 or not, because he move that buyers to black list. I don&#039;t know precisely, is the vendor scumming me or not.

				I have made one order with him and everything went great, have not tested the acid yet but from what i&#039;ve read here, it&#039;s exactly as advertised. How do you know he is ignoring your messages? <br /><br />Package took a while to get to me but communication with vendor was great.
