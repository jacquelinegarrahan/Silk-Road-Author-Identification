				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Police in Greater Manchester have warned (video) that the deaths of three young men in the last week may be related to contaminated ecstasy tablets circulating in the area and on Merseyside.<br /><br />Officers have offered complete confidentiality to drug users in their attempts to track down the source of the heart-shaped tablets coloured purple, green, yellow and blue which are thought to have put a dozen other users in hospital.<br /><br />The first death to be linked to them was in Tuebrook, Liverpool, where emergency services were called at 3.30am on Sunday to a guest house where a man had collapsed. Paramedics treated the 26-year-old at the scene and he was taken to hospital but died soon after arrival. He has not yet been named but had complained of feeling unwell after taking ecstasy.<br /><br />Doctors were also unable to save two men from Wigan who went to hospital for treatment after taking ecstasy tablets. Gareth Ashton, 28, died at Wigan Infirmary on Monday, shortly after 19-year-old Jordan Chambers died at Oldham hospital.<br /><br />Greater Manchester police said both were &quot;apparently fit young men&quot; and had suffered the same symptoms. Detailed toxicology tests are being done on all three victims before postmortem results are released. Recovering victims of what is thought to be the same syndrome are also being tested for chemical poisoning.<br /><br />Det Chief Insp Howard Millington of Wigan CID said: &quot;We are very concerned at how these deaths have occurred. Our main concern is that there may be a contaminated quantity of illegal drugs and if this goes unchecked it could result in further deaths.<br /><br />&quot;The drugs are believed to be ecstasy tablets, heart shaped in purple, green, yellow and blue. If you are suffering adverse effects after taking one of these tablets I would advise you to go to hospital for a checkup. If you have any information, I would ask you to contact police as soon as possible. We will treat the details you supply with the strictest of confidence.<br /><br />&quot;I would always urge people not to take illegal drugs and remind them that you do not know what they have been made up with. They can contain poisons and illicit chemicals that can have potentially fatal effects.&quot;<br /><br />Tributes on Twitter to Jordan Chambers included the message: &quot;God has gained an angel way too soon. Goodnight, God bless sweetheart.&quot; Another said: &quot;Such a nice lad. You&#039;ll be truly missed.&quot; Ashton, also known as Gaz, was described by friends as &quot;an absolute gem of a lad who always made everyone laugh&quot;.<br /><br />Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 7149 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SOURCE:<br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jan/22/police-contaminated-ecstasy-tablets-deaths

				Things like this make me really love SR. Shit like this doesn&#039;t really happen here. Everything gets reviewed, and most things will be scrutinized with a test kit. In the rare case that someone might fuck up and send out a tainted batch of something, most people can be alerted before they ingest it, and people can still get the drugs they want by going to a new vendor. Sure is nice.

				That&#039;s the beauty in SR. You know more about what you&#039;re going to get from a complete stranger then what you might get from someone you have known for twenty years.

				These deaths are directly caused by drug laws. Prohibition = people getting sick or dying off of bad drugs that make gangsters money.

				Well, not &quot;directly,&quot; but indirectly, yes. The people putting stuff in the pills that will kill you are the ones &quot;directly&quot; causing it.

				newsflash: it wasn&#039;t an ecstasy tablet if it killed them like that. It should read &quot;They took what they thought was ecstasy.

EZ test makes small vials of mecke or marquis that you just break open and drop a tiny spec into.<br /><br />moral of the story any responsible xtc user should test whatever they put in their body.<br />or at least consult pillreports. And if you don&#039;t, then you get no sympathy from me :)
