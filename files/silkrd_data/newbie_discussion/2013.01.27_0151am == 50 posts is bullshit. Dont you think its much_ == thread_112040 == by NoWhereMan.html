In my mind, the 50-post requirement is a right of passage. This can also be seen as another barrier to entry, along with the difficulty in getting BTC &amp; finding the SR in 1st place. We obviously can&#039;t just let a floodgate open &amp; everyone in at once. Of course there will be those who spam to get around the post-limit. But for me, I&#039;m gonna be doing this the old-fashioned way: actually reading thru the forums, and posting on topics. Contributing to conversations. Giving and gaining knowledge. The 50-post count will actually be useful for me, b/c otherwise my personality is one that would probably just lurk around. But now I&#039;ll actually be posting more :)

				I do NOT think 50 posts is too high. It forces you to actually start participating in the discussions. Even if you have nothing to offer, you will learn some new things; keep up to date with news; provided you at least read what is posted.<br /><br />
