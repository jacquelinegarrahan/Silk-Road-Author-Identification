				I was recently informed by a confidential informant that the DEA has offices in Canada now, several of them. This is a warning that the DEA is operating in many places that they shouldn&#039;t I understand that they have had offices in SA but now in the so called &quot;great white north&quot;? This is very intriguing and frightening&nbsp; for my Canadian colleges. -DFS<br /><br /><br />P.S. to any canadians don&#039;t you guys have your own version of the DEA?
