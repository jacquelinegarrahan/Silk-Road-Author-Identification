				Let me recount a true story that happened to me a few weeks ago:<br /><br />I set out on the Silk Road to find some ROXYs.&nbsp; I found the new vendor, MissBliss.&nbsp; I was excited, as her prices and demeanor seemed authentic and valid.&nbsp; I placed a minimum order with her for 5 pills (~$135 USD).&nbsp; She messaged me, concerned due to my resolution rate (%17).&nbsp; I reassured her that this was due to overseas orders that were seized and one domestic order in which I was scammed.&nbsp; To mitigate any worries on her end, I finalized early as I trusted her and she assured me that she had a 100% receive rate.&nbsp; That was that.&nbsp; The wait began.&nbsp; After about a week, I grew more and more concerned.&nbsp; She stayed in communication with me and reassured me that the post was VERY slow as of late and must be the attributing factor.&nbsp; I waited longer.&nbsp; After about 13 days, I figured it must have been captured and would not arrive.&nbsp; That is when I contacted her again and voiced my worries.&nbsp; Instead of meeting me with an empathetic ear, she simply accused me of lying to her, receiving the pack and attempting to extort more money/drugs from her.&nbsp; This was not the case.&nbsp; I was quite offended, as you can imagine, that I was met with such hostile ASSUMPTIONS.&nbsp; After which, I asked her what we could do to meet a mutual resolution.&nbsp; She has since stopped responding to me altogether and just made away with my $135 and an unhappy customer.&nbsp; I edited my feedback accordingly, however I wanted to let EVERYONE KNOW what she did to me and to beware.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read in another online forum that she has scammed other people (maybe not here, but on Atlantis).&nbsp; I will update if she ever gets back to me and resolves this matter, but I&#039;m not holding out hope.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to you all and please be careful.&nbsp; No matter how nice a vendor may seem or what their feedback (fake or real) may say... you can always get royally fucked over.&nbsp;

				busting out the shill accounts now huh?<br /><br />for the record, ya&#039;ll reading this can go on atlantis too and read my reviews there - they are all 5/5 stars and all happy customers. my stats speak for myself. <br /><br />i posted this in reply to your other slanderous thread:<br /><br />videwagina aka &quot;fuckbliss&quot;,<br /><br />as i&#039;ve told you over SR message, nicely at first, even tho you continued to badger me and demand me to fix a situation i did not create - i do not wish to entertain threats. i copy and paste all shipping addresses so they get printed as they were sent to me. if there&#039;s a mistake there, how am i to know?&nbsp; if there is someone else receiving mail at the destination and they grab it, how is that my fault?<br /><br />when i first realized what you were trying to do (extort me for another shipment) i informed vendor support about your antics, and to look over my message history with ALL my customers to prove my innocence. they replied back to me that i was doing everything right, and since i was getting consistent feedback from all the other orders, not to worry. so i&#039;m not.<br /><br />how is it that over 800 pills have been sent out in 3 weeks, yet only the one buyer that had horrible stats and *BEGGED ME* to FE after i told them i would rather not do business is the one that is giving me trouble? i dont think that&#039;s coincidence. the only reason i even let you FE in the first place was that at the time you ordered, i was starting out, and figured i needed to rack up transactions with whomever would do business with a new vendor. that was a dumb idea on my part. there is NO reason to deal with a buyer that has very high refund/finalize rates. as i&#039;ve found out, there are plenty of good buyers on the road. loyal ones too that come back time and time again.<br /><br />it is because of you specifically that i will not ship again to your entire city, nor will i be offering any more 1st class shipments to ANYONE because one bad apple spoiled the bunch, and i do not wish to have this type of conversation again with anyone else. i know the letter was sent because *i* sent it. if it were confiscated by the police, where is the seizure notice? the USPS loses like fractions of a single percent of all the millions of mail pieces per year. that&#039;s nearly the odds of a state lottery.<br /><br /><br />let this be a lesson to other vendors who are starting out: you can afford to be picky with whom you do business with. when someone has crap stats - it&#039;s for a reason. they act like this person. words are wind. this person wrote me a whole story that, looking back on it, i should&#039;ve realized was a red flag and gone with my gut to refuse service.&nbsp; my guess is his horrible refund rates are from other vendors caving in to similar strong arm tactics that videwagina is clearly currently employing. i know i did the right thing and held up my end of the bargain, and my stats prove that.<br /><br />before this devolves into a flame war, i invite anyone reading to follow through to my vendor profile - link is in my sig, and read through all of my reviews. you tell me if the 40+ other transactions that already cleared are hallucinating or not. with more coming in next few days when packs arrive.<br /><br />-mb

				OP maybe your address is bang on/burnt. You never know it still might turn up. I honestly can&#039;t see her doing this, especially just starting out. Remember it costs$$$ to open vendor account....<br /><br />Why would she take the risk for $135. <br />On the other hand I will have empathy for you and your situation, there&#039;s nothing worse that a ghost parcel/no show. Hope you recoup your lossess and work out an amicable agreement between yourselves. It would be a shame if you couldn&#039;t. good luck both of you.

				IMO, once you did FE you took a gamble and threw away any effective method to complain. Look at it from the vendor&#039;s side... you are just a random account with poor stats who is claiming to not have received your stuff. You could easily be lying and rake in some free stuff.<br /><br />Your gamble didn&#039;t work out. If you don&#039;t like to gamble, stay in escrow and have the vendor take the gamble. If both you and the vendor don&#039;t like gambling, find another vendor and build up your stats.

				a boy that creates fake accounts to reply to his initial story in order to back it up is not a boy with a true story.<br /><br />the truth stands on its own. it does not need newbie forum accounts to try and bolster the post. and really, you made them THREE MINUTES APART! seriously. think ahead a few steps next time. everything you have done screams &quot;SCAMMER!&quot;<br /><br />and that personal information is nothing you actually told me, but simply easy to find reckless breadcrumbs you left when you had your real life reddit account post on your slanderous &quot;anonymous&quot; SR reddit thread. that was my point: you&#039;re creating aliases to try and create the illusion that you have a valid concern, which you clearly dont. in addition, you link your anonymous life with your real life, which is like breaking rule #1 of darkweb security. also from the information i found on your real life reddit account, it would appear you have people in your real life that have physical access to your mailbox. <br /><br />i also gave you ample time to delete your reddit account and wipe that nonsense away to protect your identity, you should consider that a kindness. notice i didnt explicitly name the college you went (possibly still going) to. nor will i explicitly name it. anyone so inclined to find out who you are can do so easily themselves. you left that door WIDE open. also, if you had half a brain, you would&#039;ve flat out denied that the personal details mentioned were yours.&nbsp; instead, you confirmed it. real smart.<br /><br /><br />i did not start this nonsense. by publicly disseminating slanderous comments about me and my service, this falls squarely at your own feet.<br /><br />again, you should really look to those people with whom you live and interact with on a daily basis for the whereabouts of your order, since it was indeed sent.<br /><br />think logically: vendor bond is $500 - your order was $135. any vendor who would be scamming surely wouldnt risk five hundred bucks, and the privilege of continuing to sell on a mere quarter of the bond cost.<br /><br />-mb
