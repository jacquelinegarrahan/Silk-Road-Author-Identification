				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of opening a vendor account too fill the gap in street priced weed on silk road Australia. As my start up capital is low I would most likely be offering only 3.5 gram deals for $50+ $6 express shipping. <br /><br />This thread is to gauge any interest in such a substance at such a price. <br />If supply was up I could probably move onto better priced and bigger deals.<br /><br />So, who would be a customer?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />3.5Fifty

				So as soon as I make this I see a vendor made a listing for the exact same thing.<br /><br />After I got set up/ if I saved some more moolah for start up capital I could offer 1/4s for 90, 1/2s for 160 and whole ounces for 300 which I believe would all be the cheapest Aus domestic prices on the road.<br /><br />Any interest?

				Yeah I have that&#039;s why I have to start with such high prices. Once I make that back and then a little more I will be able to drop prices drastically. Maybe I&#039;m being naive but I think the price people charge on here locally compared ot the price it is available at face to face is exorbitant. I plan to provide fair deals to the community and a very modest profit to myself.

				Yeah, hopefully the first month can yield just enough for me to get my vendor bond back then I should be able to offer a huge price drop.

				Sounds nice mate. You got lots of stock? And isn&#039;t there a 10 percent fee on all sales?

				On hand stock will be low to start with as I have a capital problem but restocking will be fast and I can restock on credit if necessary. <br /><br />And yes I am aware of the commission and I will be fronting that. Buyer will only pay fair price + shipping.<br /><br />I am not sure whether to start up asap with little stock or whether to stockpile a bit and then start. Any suggestions are warmly welcome.

				Yeah sell what you&#039;ve got on hand in eighths and quarters, maybe even grams. Get your name out there, get some good feedback and when you restock you should have no problems moving high volume with very happy customers
