				I&#039;ve been reading this board for a few weeks and last week finally decided to open a market account. I haven&#039;t logged in for a few days...&nbsp; But I logged in today and have a three day old message from what appears to be a branch of the DEA. I don&#039;t know what this is or how serious it is so I made a new forum handle. I looked in to it and it seems to be some sort of LL. The names and phone number check out. The first thing that came to mind was an extortion scam of some sort or like you hear about from people that use IOPs.. <br /><br />Here is the edited version of the message with my info removed. Somebody please fucking give me some advice or repost this from an account with more than 50 posts because I&#039;m sure most people don&#039;t frequent the n00b section. <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dear &quot;**********&quot;, (Silk Road Username)<br /><br />You are receiving this message because your IP Address (***.***.***.***) has been identified in the registration of an account on this web service. The purchase of controlled substances online may be punishable by imprisonment under federal law title 21 u.s.c. 841 and 21 u.s.c.844. These controlled substances are often shipped from foreign countries. With limited exception, it is a felony to import controlled substances into the United States under title 21 u.s.c. 952.<br /><br />The Drug Enforcement Administration in coordination with the US Department of Justice and the United States Postal Inspection Service are actively and aggressively targeting members of online illicit websites for prosecution.<br /><br />This is a Cease and Desist order for you to hereby discontinue any association or affiliation with the purchase or distribution of narcotics via this web service or any similar medium. Continued use of this web service or others in defiance of this order will be met with criminal investigation and prosecution under federal narcotics statutes.<br /><br />If you have any questions or wish to make a statement in regards to this notice, or if you have any information to provide about illegal online websites or related activities, please contact the United States Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion Control at 1-877-792-2873.<br /><br />Very truly yours,<br /><br />Kevin S.

				Hmmm....was the IP address that they sent you your IP address??<br /><br />Certainly not good. Quick google search turns up other (seemingly) legit confirmations of receiving the same thing.<br />Clean house, and re-evaluate EVERY activity that you do. New handles, new computer, new btc addresses, new shipping names/addresses, new patterns, etc.<br />You&#039;re on somebody&#039;s radar and I&#039;d be very, very careful from now on.

				This is somewhat alarming in my opinion.<br /><br />Either you are trolling and are trying to frighten away all our noob friends for some reason with PSYOPS tactics, or this is a serious oversight on your part somehow. Can you possibly provide a little backstory as to how you managed to have your IP intercepted over TOR? Did you use onion.to or something? <br /><br />Did you make the mistake of googling how to use Silk Road?<br /><br />Have you made a purchase yet, because if not I think you might be one of the first people in history to get a love letter without even buying anything.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure being a member on here has to be a crime of some sort, but it wouldn&#039;t be worth prosecuting you over.. <br /><br />&nbsp;???<br /><br />

				Last active never? I&#039;m active right now dammit! This account has to be less than an hour old. It&#039;s a burner account. <br /><br />The ip address in the message is mine. I checked google for how to check my ip and it matches.<br /><br />No mention of my name or address.. just the IP. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing some looking into it and it&#039;s almost verbatim against some of the letters that were sent out to the farmers market customers by the DEA last year. I can&#039;t find the forum post that had the text sent out in them listed. Same attorney and everything. <br /><br />I downloaded the TOR browser bundle and have been using it lately. I use lot of regular clearweb sites like topix and forums. I have no idea what the fuck it is about. I have no reason to try and scare anyone. <br /><br />I want to throw my computer in the river.<br /><br />But why would they warn me before busting me? How many Farmers market letters went out last year? <br /><br />Can anyone find a copy of those letters from the DEA from that bust? <br />

				Hmmm...<br /><br />Is it at all plausible that you&#039;ve used the same username you registered somewhere before? Like.. on Topix or something? Because that would be fucking retarded. <br /><br />Shit, there&#039;s a search bar in the main market. You can message any random ass username you can type in that search bar that matches an active account. <br /><br />Couldn&#039;t some sort of &quot;Alphabet Mafia&quot; troll or bot sit on Silk Road all day and try different words and combinations from, say an index of the top passwords and usernames from database hacks or a list and just harvest SR usernames all day and run them against Google or something?<br /><br />I&#039;ve already read in articles that the government has been monitoring IRC chats in real time. I can&#039;t see why in some sort of fucked up way of social engineering and shady shit it couldn&#039;t be possible for someone to link a SR username to an IP. <br /><br />Another question.. <br /><br />What kind of activity do you do regularly on your main browser.. (clearweb)<br /><br />Do you sit and stream bootleg movies and torrent songs or have any torrent programs or you know, buy drugs on topix? Do you have a Facebook full of weed references and sit around looking at erowid or weird fetish porn all day or something that would register as suspicious?<br /><br />Do you share an internet connection with anyone? <br /><br />Because I think it&#039;s within the possibility of reason that it could be pulled off. Especially on someone who doesn&#039;t know what the hell they&#039;re doing and just tries to figure out bitcoin and Silk Road because they heard about it and managed to get on once or twice.<br /><br />You need to know a decent amount of shit to fuck around on Silk Road and not derp up. <br /><br />Either OP is a troll or a derp. I&#039;m subbed though. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it would be good if site administration investigated and could offer some confirmation.<br /><br />Anyway, assuming OP is legit, you mentioned you &quot;use clearnet sites&quot;. So I&#039;m assuming what that means is that you are accessing clearnet using a different browser while simultaneously using Tor bundle to access SR. I guess you weren&#039;t aware, but you&#039;re not supposed to do that. When you run Tor, it is essential that you only run Tor. Running other applications, including browsers or any program on your computer that talks to the internet parallel to Tor can give away your real ip, and further, connect your Tor identity/activities to your real identity. <br /><br />It&#039;s not hard to imagine LE monitoring Tor, and singling out the vulnerable connections, which would be the case here.<br /><br />If you are using uTorrent or other browsers while you use Tor ... don&#039;t! Don&#039;t do anything else internet related when you are using Tor.<br /><br />It&#039;s also a good idea to hit Ctrl+Alt+del, bring up the task manager, and close any and all processes you don&#039;t need before you run Tor.<br />There is usually a bunch of programs running in the background, some of which may be actively talking to the internet (broadcasting your ip)<br />close Windows Update (periodically talks to the internet)<br />and close anything else like product updaters, software managers etc. <br />Your processes menu should be down to a handful of items when you run Tor.<br /><br />If you are only running Tor and nothing else, there is literally no way to get your real ip, so it seems you have compromised yourself at some point along the way.<br />Sounds like you need to be a bit (or a lot) more paranoid.<br /><br />Obviously some house cleaning is needed if this is legit and LE knows your real ip address. Dealing with that dilemma should be your first order of business ...

				Some versions of TOR have a DNS leak issue; however I don&#039;t think the bundle had that problem.<br />It would only be an issue if L.E was actively monitoring your internet activities. That means are already onto you. <br /><br />Why would the DEA send a message through SR.&nbsp; ::) If DEA have your IP you would get a knock on the door or a letter in the mail. <br /><br />O.P are you positive IRL friend is not messing with you ?

				lol I&#039;ve know LE to be on the site for many months now, people better be careful, get linux liberte, rig up virtual computers with unique mac address, and wardrive for you connections, lots of places have free wifi now, beleive it or not using public internet gateways with masked ip/mac address gets pretty private, best part about Linux Liberte is that ALL network connections are torified which makes it impossible far any program to be running through your location based IP given to you by your ISP. But seriously people, stay alert, if the Feds have been on the site with multiple accouints including vendors I would assume and its still working now, we are winning the war. This letter seems to me like they are pissed off and searching for any little bits and peices they can get to attack any and all parts of the system they possibly can. This shows they are literally desperate to &quot;solve their problem&quot; (Destroy SR) As long as everyone can access the market with the highest regard of anonimity and safety I dont think they stand a chance in the world honestly.

I&#039;m no expert on the subject, but using uTorrent and clearnet browsers while using Tor is definitely not recommended, and is said to be a good way for LE (or anyone monitoring you for that matter) to identify you.

				Seriously though, even if this is a legit DEA message, consider it a blessing that all you got was a warning and nothing more, not even a knock on the door.<br /><br />To be completely honest, in the grand scheme of things, they would never bother with piss-ant purchases, unless it led to direct information on large domestic vendors. They couldn&#039;t give two shits about international vendors.<br /><br />But if they can&#039;t make a direct correlation between you and acquiring exact locations and referral information on the vendors you purchase from, they couldn&#039;t give a shit about you or your little half-ounce weed purchases.<br /><br />Stress less.<br /><br />Learn how to change your IP address, if you&#039;re using windows, wipe your HD, re-format your computer, re-install the Tor browser, change your delivery address and USE THE PGP SYSTEM.<br /><br />If this is a TROLL, however, fuck you. 9/10 for making me reply

Perhaps someone with some more credentials could weigh in, but I have heard this reiterated throughout my travels. I wouldn&#039;t mind getting it cleared up myself. Anyone?

				Just reading a post like the original poster shared still makes me tense up a bit....<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />When the DEA wants you, they come get you. They sure as hell won&#039;t send a PM to warn you. It isn&#039;t like this is drugbuyers.com and you got a 30-pack shipment of Xanax shipped from India seized by Customs...eventually triggering the infamous, heart breaking &quot;LL&quot; aka &quot;Love Letter&quot; aka &quot;We got yo shit, I dare you to come get it biatch&quot; letter.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let your nerves get the best of you...<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />Clean up your hard drive just in case, and always make sure you don&#039;t visit the &#039;ClearNet&#039; while using Tor. And don&#039;t make the mistake that SexyWax mentioned with the .to address example...in my n00b phase I did that a few times many moons ago.

Its people like the OP who will fuck it for the rest of us, clearly he has no idea how to use tor and the road safely. <br /><br />As for the DEA signing off with &#039;very truly yours&#039;, come on, how stupid are you? The letter doesnt even sound official, it just sounds like a weak attempt to seem official.<br /><br />What kind of agent would name himself on the road as DEAdiversionOffice or whatever it was, in plain sight for all to see?<br /><br />Sometimes people get themselves so paranoid that they stop thinking altogether. <br /><br />If the OP gets himself sucked in to this then I have to seriously question his practices and what he&#039;s doing to draw attention to himself and expose his IP (if it really was his real ip, if it even really happened).<br />&nbsp;<br />DEA? No.<br />OP insecure? Most likely.<br /><br />Fuck onion.to off, open up all the resources and reading on tor, pgp, VPNs, and anything else related you can find, download the latest tor browser bundle, disconnect off the internet, start reading and dont reconnect until you know you&#039;re covered...<br /><br /><br /><br />lol, OP says funny things like<br />&quot;I checked google for how to check my ip&quot;<br />scary.<br />and<br />&quot;No mention of my name or address.. just the IP.&quot;<br />If DEA had your IP they could work with your ISP and get your name and address, and take it from there, not send you a letter like that to your sr mailbox, lol.<br /><br /><br />You should have to pass a test when becoming a SR vendor on the basics, covering security and proper practices. Its these guys unaware that will lead to packages seized, wasting our time, and worse things etc. There&#039;s vendors out there who refuse to learn and use pgp, WTF? Does anyone even use a VPN and or VM, or does your ISP know you&#039;re connecting straight to tor?<br /><br />Im not scared of LE, Im scared of OPs like this.

				I the OP wanted to scare newbies into being safer it worked for me. I have done extensive reading and I havent heard that using a torrent service or other link to the Internet at the same time as TOR is dangerous. I prefer using Tails with TOR but there have been a few times I have checked in (only) with SR while using the browser bundle through Windows. I try to bounce around on other wifi signals to keep it confusing but now im worried.<br /><br />Time to get smarter I guess. If 1 thing like this can come up it shows me I need to learn a little more before I do anything else. The forum has been acting a little weird on me today freezing up for a second and not getting the whole page when I click a link. Stuff that is probably nothing but that worries me someone is interfering with my connection. Is that possible? Is that how the browser would behave if they were?<br /><br />If I get on wifi connections close by that I have the info too can the owner of that wifi signal (or anyone else) see anything im doing when I use Tor with Tails? What about when I use windows and mark the connection as public? Would a VPN be a safer way to get on then using random wifi signals with tails?<br />If anyone knows any of the answers that would be great. <br /><br />I never really thought about the fact that alot of these vendors arent much more than newbies and that they may not be very educated on how to stay safe. Not knowing or using PGP? I need to start considering more about what the other guy is doing to stay safe thus keeping me safe. In the meantime I need to get back to reading more and learning more. Maybe a lot of us newbies should do the same.<br />*I just went to scroll down to post but the page stops just below this box! Thats what im talking about when I say the forum is acting weird. I need to copy and refresh to post.

				I&#039;m calling total bullshit too on the OP. After re-reading his posts, I can smell a rat. Here is some of the language that didn&#039;t seem right:<br /><br />&quot;I use lot of regular clearweb sites like topix and forums&quot;....i am pretty sure the only people who use topix for anything drug related are either super desperate, underage, shit for brains, or cops. <br /><br />&quot;some sort of LL&quot; and &quot;a branch of the DEA&quot;....LE or LEO but what the hell is LL?? and who refers to a branch of the DEA?? They&#039;re not a fuckin bank or one of the three departments of government (tho they prob think they are).<br /><br />&quot;new forum handle&quot; and &quot;market account&quot;....who talks like this?? A troll who wants to scare you, that&#039;s who!!<br /><br />It seems like time &amp; time again we see posts from LE designed to instill fear and deter activity on sr. That&#039;s the only tactic that has any affect whatsoever. Well its not gonna work on me!!

				Ummm..&nbsp; <br /><br />LL is shorthand for love letter.

				Standard cease and desist letter. It pretty much just telling you to stop it. That&#039;s it. ALL or any communication between an official office and their mark (suspect) has to be done through proper and authorized channels, especially if they issue the notice first. They would have never sent a message to anyone from a Silkroad account. Having the correct IP address is very strange and really makes you wonder if they are using different tactics and procedures now. Always be on the safe side. The computer you connect to Silkroad with BETTER be an encrypted VM. If it is not, then STOP USING SILKROAD RIGHT NOW. Make sure you ALWAYS use a VM. And people, it doesn&#039;t have to be on a flash drive. Just make sure it is fully encrypted. Once it is encrypted and only YOU have the password it may take a supercomputer 20 years to break it. And that is a LOW number. Oracle Virtualbox is FREE. No excuses. Common sense goes a long way.<br />

So I&#039;m assuming what that means is that you are accessing clearnet using a different browser while simultaneously using Tor bundle to access SR. I guess you weren&#039;t aware, but you&#039;re not supposed to do that. When you run Tor, it is essential that you only run Tor. Running other applications, including browsers or any program on your computer that talks to the internet parallel to Tor can give away your real ip, and further, connect your Tor identity/activities to your real identity. <br /><br />It&#039;s not hard to imagine LE monitoring Tor, and singling out the vulnerable connections, which would be the case here.<br /><br />If you are using uTorrent or other browsers while you use Tor ... don&#039;t! Don&#039;t do anything else internet related when you are using Tor.<br /><br />It&#039;s also a good idea to hit Ctrl+Alt+del, bring up the task manager, and close any and all processes you don&#039;t need before you run Tor.<br />There is usually a bunch of programs running in the background, some of which may be actively talking to the internet (broadcasting your ip)<br />close Windows Update (periodically talks to the internet)<br />and close anything else like product updaters, software managers etc. <br />Your processes menu should be down to a handful of items when you run Tor.<br /><br />If you are only running Tor and nothing else, there is literally no way to get your real ip, so it seems you have compromised yourself at some point along the way.<br />Sounds like you need to be a bit (or a lot) more paranoid.<br /><br />Obviously some house cleaning is needed if this is legit and LE knows your real ip address. Dealing with that dilemma should be your first order of business ...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Man I didn&#039;t know that. Thanks for the heads up, I&#039;ll be closing out the other programs now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Except TR0N, that this is not actually true. I assume you&#039;re using the TBB. Unless you configure applications to use the right port so they communicate over Tor, there is no way for them to broadcast your real IP or leak DNS. Your regular internet traffic and your Tor traffic are separate, they don&#039;t mix. <br /><br />There are problems with running other applications. It&#039;s just that running them in parallel to Tor isn&#039;t normally a security risk. For example some common security fails are:<br /><br />You may accidentally login to your social networking accounts or emails while using Tor. <br /><br />Or you could download a file though Tor and open it, and it could call home, deliberately or inadvertently revealing your IP.<br /><br />Or you could run software through Tor that leaks DNS. Bittorent is an notorious example of that, you should never run Bittorent via Tor. Separately in parallel is fine.<br /><br />Or you could have LE spyware on your machine logging your keystrokes. I think you should be very wary of a certain closed source instant messaging and VOIP program that is quite popular.<br /><br />In any case, I am pleased the DEA sends messages forewarning me in advance they have my IP. Gentlemen, it&#039;s been a pleasure. <br /><br />Now I can disable all the bear traps, giant rolling boulders, laser sharks and R.O.U.S in the Fire Swamp. It was fun for a while, but you wouldn&#039;t believe the upkeep, constant neighbor complaints and other whinging, the insurance, on and on, it just becomes impractical in the end.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Running Tor and also running other internet using programs at the same time does not by itself compromise your anonymity.<br /><br />There is a special collection of circumstances that could produce problems, but information does not somehow move from your regular internet browser to the TBB. It does not happen. Different applications use different port numbers.

				Some wraparound.<br /><br />Here are my variations (not in order of likeliness):<br /><br />1. OP is DEA himself and wants you to think, that they actually can get your real IP over TOR. Trolling at its finest therefore. But it&#039;s unlikely that a non-ordering customer gets a threat while people who bought in for thousands of dollars (if you buy up drugs in the 4-fig range it might look like you are selling them offroad) never saw such shit. <br /><br />2. OP is a troll who somehow profits from such a scare letter, may it be 0.1% change in Bitcoin prices or the avaibility of a certain type of drugs (like one weed strain from a specific vendor which is sold out within minutes and he tries to reduce the number of ordering people by scaring them)<br /><br />3. The mail is from a guy who knows OP, and knows his IP through standard IM/Forums whatnot.<br /><br />4. OP&#039;s IP is static and doesn&#039;t change every 24 hours therefore making it super easy to obtain if he ever mixed usernames on SR with any clearnet site<br /><br />5. The Mail is really from the DEA or some dude who wants to be in the DEA and is more like a &quot;happy 420 day&quot; le<br /><br /><br /><br />Keep on truckin&#039;!

Or perhaps something no one thought of like a compromised Bitcoin exchange tracing ip addresses and bitcoin addresses? <br />I don&#039;t think running other browsers while on tor would effect anything.

				Since this thread has so many views and so many subbed users wouldn&#039;t this be a good place to discuss how this could be theoretically possible? So even in that case, we make use of the troll thread or at least have a platform for discussion? <br /><br />Like a war game or something. <br /><br />Construct scenarios as to how this could be possible? <br /><br />My contributions:<br /><br />1. Suspicious internet activity/shared internet connection. <br /><br />2. Running some sort of bittorrent or old school GNUtella based P2P program on a computer while on TOR. <br /><br />3. Opening a .pdf on TOR.. (think zip zap payment slip.)<br /><br />4. Open identifying tabs on other websites/browsers like facebook.<br /><br />5. Troll post. Really good troll post @ 2,000+ views in a day. Psyops and forum disruption tactics. <br /><br />In the theoretical scenario which the OP posted, it sounds like his experience with computers and browsers, etc. is shit. That could definitely be a determining factor. If you like in a major city and can wardrive that&#039;s awesome. But if you live in a suburb or a rural area I really doubt there are a lot of TOR users on your ISP. <br /><br />

He was merely stating that you can&#039;t assume key-logging from evidence of&nbsp; Skype-tapping. I agree that it was inevitable that Skype would eventually be listened to and is unsurprising to see that people have been indited from information gleaned from Skype. Key-logging is a very different story altogether though and he, like I would like evidence of this as opposed to making an assumption. It&#039;s a massive intrusion in to someone&#039;s privacy that I&#039;m not sure would find a legal basis in any liberal democracy. It might be used for spying on terrorists but as a method to prosecute somebody for supplying drugs in court? I can&#039;t see it. <br /><br />On a side note, I&#039;m assuming the Skype servers are all located in the US, meaning no sovereign but the US has jurisdiction to listen anyway? I have heard many times that the Mossad have cracked the Skype encryption however and listen to enemy conversations on the platform but never for prosecuting their own citizens in a court of law.

I mean let&#039;s not make it too easy for the government! You really ought to start investigating more extensive methods of anonymizing yourself than merely using TBB and assuming you have the same protections as an inner city dweller.<br /><br />PolyFront has it aright: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The literal definition of anonymity is a state of namelessness. A more technical definition of anonymity is the state of being indistinguishable from a given set size. As an example, imagine a closed communication interface with several hundred members. If all of the members use the name &#039;anonymous&#039; to make their posts, they are indistinguishable from each other based on naming information (however, they may not be anonymous based off IP information). However, they are not indistinguishable from those who are not a part of the system.

There are all kinds of goodies that can improve anonymity if you think about it. Don&#039;t look at Tor as a magic bullet. It&#039;s the best there is, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;ll always be the case. We rely on cryptographic trust in our world, not on assumptions or arguments from authority. We should have an acronym for this: BYOR - bring your own research. Too many people depend on the words of a few as gospel. That&#039;s the kind of attitude that can lead to successful social engineering attacks by adept LE hackers.<br /><br />Read this: http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/polyfront.html<br /><br />And search out similar types of information. <br /><br />LE hackers are likely to be well trained. But they are few, and we are the many. By leveraging Darknet know-how and scaling up, we can become unstoppable. Our strengths are adaptability and scale. But this is not predestined and won&#039;t happen if we&#039;re lazy. If ten thousand people suddenly learn just 1 piece of new tradecraft, however simple, we quickly gain an assailable advantage that knocks LE back months or years. Look at the impact of using something as simple as LOIC. Learning something like PGP is infinitely more powerful than that, and there is at least 10,000 people on this network that use it. It&#039;s like using the phone. If 1 person does it, who cares. But if 10,000 people do it, the power of the network expands exponentially rather than additively.<br /><br />Education! Education!

I have a couple torrent programs. I&#039;m guilty of simultaneous browsing while having TOR open. All I did was download the Tor browser. I bookmarked the silkroad address. I have a static IP address. I&#039;ve probably opened .pdfs. I just learned about metadata and downloaded images from the market site to my computer. My ISP has sent my roommate torrent warnings in the past and they throttled my service.<br /><br />My internet connection is shared with my roommates on campus. The area I live in is basically just a small college town. A friend told me about silk road and I did some research and made an account. I didn&#039;t tell anyone because I had planned on making a fair amount of money picking up a few things here and selling them locally. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t use onion.to that I&#039;m aware of. If I did it was just to read the forums. My forum name was the same as my market name. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t give anyone my username. I had only registered the account about two weeks before and I&#039;ve been trying to learn bitcoins and encryption before I made a purchase.<br /><br />The extent of my black market experience has been making small orders on topix.com and a few online pharmacies.<br /><br />My email inbox is full of pharmacy spam. I&#039;ve even been the subject of a DEA extortion scam which is what I immediately thought this was when I logged in. And yes, I know that I&#039;m probably going to be the whipping boy on here for quite some time.<br /><br />Believe me or not. I don&#039;t care. Somebody is making an example out of me or fucking with me. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Mullvad is a good VPN service if you are in need of one (eg. like pine said, you live in an area where it&#039;s likely you&#039;re the only person in 100km using Tor).<br /><br />Mostly because they accept BTC as payment, so there is never any exchange of personal information if they are subpoenaed.&nbsp; <br /><br />They also claim to keep no logs whatsoever, which if true makes them a fantastic service because even if subpoenaed for information coming from your account with them ... there simply is no information of any kind whatsoever for you or any other user, so whichever judicial entity subpoenaed them will get bubkis on you.<br /><br />It might get Mullvad in hot water for not keeping logs, but you&#039;d be safe.&nbsp; I obviously can&#039;t prove their telling the truth when they claim not to keep logs, but swince they accept BTC as payment and have no information on you (aka you didn&#039;t use a credit card or paypal or something stupid) there&#039;s no personal info for them to give.&nbsp; Just use TOR when buying an account, and don&#039;t lose your customer ID if you buy a long period of their service with BTC, cuz if you do, you aint getting your BTC back, and will lose all the time left on your service with them.

				I have a slight problem with your reply. It&#039;s a little too good. Your rhetoric is a little too advanced for a new user from my experience. You&#039;re trying too hard to make this situation feasible.&nbsp; <br /><br />You have no credibility due to posting from a burner account, so you cannot effectively use ethos in your rhetoric, so you appeal to pathos previously, and now your argument has become more concise and appeals more to logos. <br /><br />Modes of persuasion: <br /><br />Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.<br /><br />Ethos (Credibility), or ethical appeal, means convincing by the character of the author. We tend to believe people whom we respect. One of the central problems of argumentation is to project an impression to the reader that you are someone worth listening to, in other words making yourself as author into an authority on the subject of the paper, as well as someone who is likable and worthy of respect.<br /><br />Pathos (Emotional) means persuading by appealing to the reader&#039;s emotions. We can look at texts ranging from classic essays to contemporary advertisements to see how pathos, emotional appeals, are used to persuade. Language choice affects the audience&#039;s emotional response, and emotional appeal can effectively be used to enhance an argument.<br /><br />Logos (Logical) means persuading by the use of reasoning. This will be the most important technique we will study, and Aristotle&#039;s favorite. We&#039;ll look at deductive and inductive reasoning, and discuss what makes an effective, persuasive reason to back up your claims. Giving reasons is the heart of argumentation, and cannot be emphasized enough. We&#039;ll study the types of support you can use to substantiate your thesis, and look at some of the common logical fallacies, in order to avoid them in your writing.

				this doesnt sound good. but its the first ive ever heard of it. if your careful this wont happen. you not invisible ya know. dont any undue chances with your safety. move shit around. but use a verified address and not a fake. send yourself a few packages and see if there is any tampering. maybe even questionable packages just to see if there is any problem. its worth it.

He was merely stating that you can&#039;t assume key-logging from evidence of&nbsp; Skype-tapping. I agree that it was inevitable that Skype would eventually be listened to and is unsurprising to see that people have been indited from information gleaned from Skype. Key-logging is a very different story altogether though and he, like I would like evidence of this as opposed to making an assumption. It&#039;s a massive intrusion in to someone&#039;s privacy that I&#039;m not sure would find a legal basis in any liberal democracy. It might be used for spying on terrorists but as a method to prosecute somebody for supplying drugs in court? I can&#039;t see it. <br /><br />On a side note, I&#039;m assuming the Skype servers are all located in the US, meaning no sovereign but the US has jurisdiction to listen anyway? I have heard many times that the Mossad have cracked the Skype encryption however and listen to enemy conversations on the platform but never for prosecuting their own citizens in a court of law.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then perhaps I am the cynical one, because I am assuming that Skype is used as a keylogger. I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s doing it on a mass scale or whether it&#039;s a targeted approach. That is the only question in my mind.<br /><br />Lest we forget, an entire years worth of keystrokes, with you typing every day, would only be about 5Mb. It&#039;s spying on a budget.<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with either of you, that keylogging is dramatically different to a wiretap. There is no genuine difference between the two. I think you&#039;re stuck on the metaphor of a wiretap, where data is &quot;intercepted&quot; via somebody in the middle as if there was some dude on a hoist tapping a cable from a telegraph pole. Again, this is not what is happening with a P2P encrypted communications &#039;wiretap&#039;. This is mass surveillance technology by its nature.<br /><br />There is a piece of software inside *your* computer. You make the assumption that because Skype is listening to instant messaging and records it, that it won&#039;t be possible /legal to listen to keystrokes destined for other applications. Well! It is *easy* for Skype to listen to your keystrokes whether or not they are intended for it. There is no magic barrier that prevents that. And even if there was some protection against this &#039;over reach&#039; then you&#039;ve got to figure that the company that owns the VOIP/instant messaging program also owns the OS on which it&#039;s installed too! How would you like a windows update with a RAT to keep you company?<br /><br />If it is technologically easy, then it will be done. Judges don&#039;t know their assholes from their elbows with their AOL email addresses, they&#039;ll believe what they&#039;re told by Joe Serious Square in the uniform. If they don&#039;t, they go under the hammer like the rest of us. Nevermind judges, it happens to congressmen too. And your &quot;Law&quot; is a joke. Is that the same law that put weev in prison for a couple of years for downloading publicly accessible information, that is putting teenagers in prison for months to years for DDOSing websites? The &quot;Law&quot; is for little, weak people, like servile LE agents who think that their masters are as patriotic as they are when in reality they&#039;ll be sold out in a heartbeat. <br /><br />If you coerce enough people and bribe them off, or wave a NSL citing national security then there is no &quot;Law&quot; for you and that is a fucking fact. There are several million NSL letters issued right now and active. Do you really think there is a couple of hundred thousand terrorists walking around? Well, if not, then there is only 1 conclusion you can be coming to. The Feds have been using the tools of the clandestine services to get their dirty work done.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s a massive intrusion in to someone&#039;s privacy that I&#039;m not sure would find a legal basis in any liberal democracy.

America already has concentration camps, that much is known, and probably more private secure facilities as well.

				With the right amount of social engineering and skill and free time I can guarantee this &quot;scenario&quot; is possible. What I just don&#039;t understand is the wording of it, or why it would be pulled on a new user if it was a genuine incident. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t know the alphabet mafia had started recruiting trolls. In either scenario, OP or the sender of that message is LEO. <br /><br />If anyone else gets one of these messages I&#039;ll be worried. But I&#039;ve been on the darkwebz long enough to know anything is possible. I read those anon boards for fun and they hacked north korea for fun. <br /><br />Maybe they didn&#039;t know you haven&#039;t bought anything? <br /><br />Office of diversion seems a little specific. However they also deal with non-pharmaceuticals as well. Not just diverted prescriptions. <br /><br />And considering that most illicit drug seizures are prescriptions (painkillers, benzos, steroids, etc.) they would have significant experience with package interception and agents who monitor international mail and work with customs. <br /><br />So that&#039;s plausible. <br /><br />The US governement has been hiring and training hundreds of teenage hackers over the past year. <br /><br />My bet is you&#039;ve got a rogue tor exit node, or a bored LEO sponsored troll with some ISP data trying to mess with the noobs. <br /><br />I mentioned earlier that something similar happened to a friend of mine recently. Well it was similar, but on topix.com.<br /><br />I imagine that a vendor had just kept some shipping info and was trying to get extortion money posing as an undercover detective or postal inspector on topix and sending out PM&#039;s to vendors and buyers in the alp forum. <br /><br /><br />

Everyone using this site should have their own interests at heart and be using a VPN on top of Tor Browser Bundle. It only costs about $50 per year, you can pay anonymously via btc for most services, and it gives you that one extra level of security. Better safe than sorry. Also, everyone needs to learn to use PGP encryption properly. And use OTR for any chat apps you use. Those are the very basics. With a bit of further reading, there are many more steps you can take to stay secure. Do your homework. Stay safe.<br /><br />Much love to all.<br /><br />Kind regards, Googleyed

If pine is wrong, pine lives. It has a nice symmetry to it, don&#039;t you think?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK. Let me outline what I think has to happen for LE to be able to use Skype as a key logger to build a case against SR users.<br /><br />1. a) LE have to become aware that the Skype account holder is using SR - There&#039;s is no way Skype/LE monitor people&#039;s calls without good reason. That&#039;s conspiracy theory talk if you ask me. So I can&#039;t see how 1. a) is possible. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) LE have to link a Skype account with a user they have identified on SR - If someone is using TBB correctly, how??<br /><br />2. If they somehow do find out either of the above, they have to gain permission to key-log ever stroke from any computer the Skype-holder is logged in to? Even when permission is given to listen to phones, the permission is extremely limited. So in this sense, yes there is a massive difference between tapping (whatever the technology) and key-logging and I don&#039;t see it being granted very readily.<br /><br />(But the main point is, if they already know the user is using SR, why would they bother going to all of that effort?? They know they&#039;re using SR so they can simply conduct real life surveillance. If you&#039;re suggesting that LE would only become aware of someone&#039;s use of SR by using Skype as a key-logger I think you&#039;re getting into seriously fantastical stuff. Key-logging strokes mightn&#039;t take up much memory but the man hours involved monitoring every Skype user that types the words Silk Road on their computer is beyond colossal.)<br /><br />3. If the IP address of the user and the Skype server are in a different jurisdiction there also has be severe limitations to the listening they can do that would be of use to them in a prosecution - You can&#039;t use surveillance by US police to prosecute somebody in a French court for example.&nbsp; <br /><br />4. Let&#039;s say, that in the unlikely event this happens and they find evidence of using Silk Road, this is still useless to them for a prosecution. LE have to conduct surveillance and a raid, AND have to find stuff on the computer and more to the point, have to find drugs. Once again, if the suspect is in another country, this requires massive collusion and resources. This isn&#039;t going to happen unless you&#039;re a Mexican cartel boss. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Is key-logging technologically possible? Of course it is. Is it used by government agencies? Probably, when it&#039;s investigating terrorism or gathering other intelligence. They will never have to use the evidence gleaned from key-logging in court. For prosecuting people selling drugs online, they do. If key-logging were to keep me up at night, it would be because I would be revealing my passwords hackers. If I worry about LE, I worry about them sitting outside my house with a telephoto lens and following me around, not logging my key strokes needlessly when they already suspect me. <br /><br />But yes, by not using Skype, you have nothing to lose. So by all means... :)

The odds of LE having the IP of everybody using tor2web to get to SR is pretty high although of course nobody can say for sure. Course nobody who was slothful enough to use .onion.to is ever going to go to ground.

				What I received in my PM isn&#039;t exactly anything I feel like posting in the open forum. I messaged the &quot;DEA&quot; account out of curiosity and the reply made me uncomfortable. The user referred to something that I had said in the private vendor forum. <br /><br />I never suspected the vendor forums are private. This site has been around for two years. It wouldn&#039;t be hard for an account to fall into the wrong hands. It just was an implication of knowledge. Like how Dennis from It&#039;s Always Sunny intimidates women into sleeping with them. It&#039;s the implication bro. <br /><br />I can&#039;t speak for the other vendor or users who messaged with him, but I&#039;m sure as hell not messaging that account again. I was unable to ascertain whether or not this person is law enforcement, but he presented himself with a decent amount of knowledge pertaining to the etiquette of Silk Road, made mention of something I said in the private forum, and just has the demeanor of a sick-fuck LEO with a penchant for trolling. <br /><br />Since there are a few moderators subscribed to this thread, I would like to recommend that one of you suggest to the higher-ups that this account be suspended. I really don&#039;t see how any good could come out of having an active troll/law enforcement account on the site. Best-case scenario: he&#039;s sucking up precious darkweb bandwith and is an unnecessary appendage that needs to be amputated for my browsing speed. <br /><br />Worst case scenario: We have an enemy combatant in our midst. No good will come of having an account any random vendor or internet drug dealer or buyer can send messages and information to; expecting repercussions or fuckery from Officer Trollberry. <br /><br />Fuck this shit.

				As scout said it&#039;s been put on DPR&#039;s radar so they can investigate the account. I am aware of the types of messages you are referring too and yes they do make for unsettling reading but at the end of the day what we post in these forums, both public and vendor should be considered totally open to LE and post accordingly. <br /><br />There is no privacy here, anything we post should be assumed as being scrutinized by the Officer Trollberry&#039;s of this world. <br /><br />

				As scout said the information included in communications between our mystery member and those who have taken it upon themselves to contact them has only included info readily available on the public and vendor forums. <br /><br />I think what has unnerved a few people is how this information has been used in the context of the messages sent, the general tone is one of self assuredness that alludes to the sender maybe knowing specific information relevant to the recipient. It&#039;s like meeting someone for the first time and having them already knowing some specific personal details about you, takes you off guard a bit and causes you to wonder what else they may know.<br /><br />No one likes the thought of being under scrutiny of LE so to be given the impression the DEA has you in their cross hairs would understandably be concerning however as I said before none of this should come as any surprise to anyone really. LE are all over these forums and it stands to reason they are gathering information, I think sometimes we may be a little too complacent in our comfort zone on here.<br /><br />Whether this is the DEA or just some joker fucking with people only time will tell, same rules apply as always in that you should only post what you want others to know without offering up any identifiable information. <br /><br />My money is still on this all being psyops.<br /><br />

				Nothing sensitive was said to me. I&#039;m a vendor. They&#039;re not going to tell me anything they know about me and compromise their case. They&#039;re certainly not going to send me a cease and desist letter either. All I&#039;ll say is, the language and tone of the email was very convincing in making me think it&#039;s the DEA. There was one thing said and another thing I noticed from my exchanges with the account-holder that introduce some doubt as to the legitimacy however. Bottom line is, we can never know for sure but as Scout says, I think this is a good opportunity for everyone to check they&#039;re taking all the necessary measures to stay safe. <br /><br />I think I&#039;ve said all I&#039;ve had to say on this thread. <br /><br />Stay safe and happy shopping.

Let me outline what I think has to happen for LE to be able to use Skype as a key logger to build a case against SR users.<br /><br />1. a) LE have to become aware that the Skype account holder is using SR - There&#039;s is no way Skype/LE monitor people&#039;s calls without good reason. That&#039;s conspiracy theory talk if you ask me. So I can&#039;t see how 1. a) is possible.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) LE have to link a Skype account with a user they have identified on SR - If someone is using TBB correctly, how??<br /><br />2. If they somehow do find out either of the above, they have to gain permission to key-log ever stroke from any computer the Skype-holder is logged in to? Even when permission is given to listen to phones, the permission is extremely limited. So in this sense, yes there is a massive difference between tapping (whatever the technology) and key-logging and I don&#039;t see it being granted very readily.<br /><br />(But the main point is, if they already know the user is using SR, why would they bother going to all of that effort?? They know they&#039;re using SR so they can simply conduct real life surveillance. If you&#039;re suggesting that LE would only become aware of someone&#039;s use of SR by using Skype as a key-logger I think you&#039;re getting into seriously fantastical stuff. Key-logging strokes mightn&#039;t take up much memory but the man hours involved monitoring every Skype user that types the words Silk Road on their computer is beyond colossal.)<br /><br />3. If the IP address of the user and the Skype server are in a different jurisdiction there also has be severe limitations to the listening they can do that would be of use to them in a prosecution - You can&#039;t use surveillance by US police to prosecute somebody in a French court for example.&nbsp; <br /><br />4. Let&#039;s say, that in the unlikely event this happens and they find evidence of using Silk Road, this is still useless to them for a prosecution. LE have to conduct surveillance and a raid, AND have to find stuff on the computer and more to the point, have to find drugs. Once again, if the suspect is in another country, this requires massive collusion and resources. This isn&#039;t going to happen unless you&#039;re a Mexican cartel boss. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Is key-logging technologically possible? Of course it is. Is it used by government agencies? Probably, when it&#039;s investigating terrorism or gathering other intelligence. They will never have to use the evidence gleaned from key-logging in court. For prosecuting people selling drugs online, they do. If key-logging were to keep me up at night, it would be because I would be revealing my passwords hackers. If I worry about LE, I worry about them sitting outside my house with a telephoto lens and following me around, not logging my key strokes needlessly when they already suspect me. <br /><br />But yes, by not using Skype, you have nothing to lose. So by all means... :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Conspiracy talk? We must be on completely separate wavelengths, or perhaps in two different centuries.<br /><br />Marcel, the greater availability of technology is making LE adopt more and more precrime strategies, known as premptive policing. It includes various profiling techniques, such as the ones you see used at airports by the TSA. This is a general trend that is increasing, there is nothing especially outrageous about it, I&#039;m not passing on messages from Alex Jones here. Right now there are LE agents using special equipment to detect high emotional states in people entering zones such as airports. If you are feeling particularly stressed, there are visual cues, odors that can be detected by sensors.<br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/12/02/airport.security/index.html<br /><br />The Stazi pioneered the use of odor collection and detection, especially in connection with dogs, and now it appears that the TSA &amp; co are taking up that baton, especially with the &#039;seats&#039;.<br /><br />Back on the specific subject of Skype, there is every way LE can detect what is in your instant messages with a simple keyword search. I strongly emphasize to you that there is no technological difficulty in using Skype for mass surveillance. Any difficulties would be legal, and I&#039;m convinced that a judge is going to give the DEA and FBI a whole lot of leeway when it comes to sophisticated operations like SR.<br /><br />Most people assume Skype is a pure P2P application. This is not completely true. There are special computers called supernodes which Skype employes to enhance the organization of the Skype network. Many of us believe that these supernodes are serving a dual purpose to allow the possibility of a wiretap. Microsoft applied for a patent (which was given) to wiretap VOIP, the patent explains how what we think is a supernode is being used to conduct eavesdropping for VOIP or instant messaging. The only other possibility is that random Skype users have their machines commandeered for a wiretap, which seems highly unlikely for pragmatic reasons.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Legal Intercept Patent<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br />Aspects of the subject matter described herein relate to silently recording communications.

The data as modified is then passed to a protocol entity that uses the data to establish a communication session.

It is unnecessary to involve a supernode because they have your plaintext (which is why &quot;logging&quot; is the right word vs &quot;intercept&quot;), although they have access to your session keys too if need be, and basically all manner of data is vacuumed out of your machine and into theirs.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> If I worry about LE, I worry about them sitting outside my house with a telephoto lens and following me around, not logging my key strokes needlessly when they already suspect me. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This in particular makes no sense. Let me turn that around for you. <br /><br />Why on earth would they be sitting outside your house with a telephoto lens, when they can take photos of you every day with your own webcam, record every conversation in the room, record all your keystrokes and take screenshots of your desktop?<br /><br />Like I have already said, I cannot know whether they are using Skype for mass surveillance, although this is to me a far from unlikely possibility. I do know they are using Skype as a resource to gather information on individuals. Given everything I have posted, I believe it would be a good move for SR users not to be using Skype to talk about the Silk Road, nor to have the program running in the background.<br /><br />I have the strange vibe Marcel, that you think the Law is on your side at some level. That if you are apprehended that somebody, somewhere, is going to kick up a fuss about your privacy being violated. This is cognitive dissonance, these people will throw you to the wolves if they can. It really is a Us vs Them thing, many LE agents don&#039;t even believe you&#039;re human. Every piece of information obtained from LE HQs confirms this general worldview. If anybody from SR is arrested, they are going to be presented to the jury or judge as a leet haxxor with special talents, and hence this validates any unusual intrusiveness of the LE techniques. A piece of paper isn&#039;t going to protect you. The police break the law all the time to catch criminals and they are nearly always retroactively forgiven for this behind closed doors with the right judge, or if they have an awkward case they will just call their source of information a &quot;confidential informant&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s amazing how many &quot;confidential informants&quot; that mysteriously turn up when there is a case that is tough to crack.<br /><br />You get the point. The system is beyond corrupt, don&#039;t depend on it for any mercies. In general, the honest cops get the grunt jobs and the scum that makes up the numbers by whatever means rises to the top. Convictions almost never occur, except in highly unusual situations like NY when practically the entire department was fired. For a good detective to rise to a decent position, they either have to be almost supernaturally gifted or have family connections. If you want a fair shake in today&#039;s environment, you want your local cop shop to be dominated by one or two families with a strong sense of fairness and duty (as you probably know, like being a solider, some jobs tend to be done traditionally by a small set of families). Unfortunately that LE agents are rotated out of areas on a continual basis to prevent corruption, although it sounds logical, actually leads to more corruption of a far, far more vile kind in the end. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1036981#msg1036981">Quote from: tree on April 20, 2013, 10:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your articles don&#039;t say anything about Skype being able to record your every keystroke when not using Skype.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just to let you know, I found a link which explains some of what I was getting at, in that there is no magic isolation between GUI programs on your desktop, most people, including computer people appear to assume there is, but there is not.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There certainly is one thing that most Linux users don&#039;t realize about their Linux systems... this is the lack of GUI-level isolation, and how it essentially nullifies all the desktop security. I wrote about it a few times, I spoke about it a few times, yet I still come across people who don&#039;t realize it all the time.<br /><br />So, let me stress this one more time: if you have two GUI applications, e.g. an OpenOffice Word Processor, and a stupid Tetris game, both of which granted access to your screen (your X server), then there is no isolation between those two apps. Even if they run as different user accounts! Even if they are somehow sandboxed by SELinux or whatever! None, zero, null, nil!<br /><br />The X server architecture, designed long time ago by some happy hippies who just thought all the people apps are good and non-malicious, simply allows any GUI application to control any other one. No bugs, no exploits, no tricks, are required. This is all by design. One application can sniff or inject keystrokes to another one, can take snapshots of the screen occupied by windows belonging to another one, etc.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe me, I suggest you do a simple experiment. Open a terminal window, as normal user, and run xinput list, which is a standard diagnostic program for Xorg (on Fedora you will likely need to install it first: yum install xorg-x11-apps):<br /><br />$ xinput list<br /><br />It will show you all the pointer and keyboard devices that your Xorg knows about. Note the ID of the device listed as “AT keyboard” and then run (as normal user!):<br /><br />$ xinput test id<br /><br />It should now start displaying the scancodes for all the keys you press on the keyboard. If it doesn&#039;t, it means you used a wrong device ID.<br /><br />Now, for the best, start another terminal window, and switch to root (e.g. using su, or sudo). Notice how the xinput running as user is able to sniff all your keystrokes, including root password (for su), and then all the keystrokes you enter in your root session. Start some GUI app as root, or as different user, again notice how your xinput can sniff all the keystrokes you enter to this other app!<br /><br />http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.se/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />

Some guys even believe that their traffic is mirrored in real time/they made a deal with the feds to stay up/not face problems.

				@Pine<br /><br />Somehow in your lengthy rely, you managed not to even address my main points. <br /><br />1. If TBB is used correctly, they can&#039;t know who I am. If they don&#039;t know who I am, they can&#039;t use my Skype account to &#039;watch&#039; me in all the ways you alluded to. How can they go to a judge and get a warrant when they don&#039;t know who they&#039;re getting a warrant for??? <br /><br />2. If they get to the stage where they know who I am, getting a warrant to watch me through my computer is pretty damn useless to them because at that stage they need hard evidence, ie. both my computer with evidence of use of SR on it and most importantly, DRUGS to make a conviction!! (so of course it is far more of a concern to me them sitting outside my house planning a raid) <br /><br />PS. I&#039;ve stated twice that I know it&#039;s technologically possible to keylog. That&#039;s not what I&#039;m getting at. <br /><br />PPS. I don&#039;t think the law is on anyone&#039;s side. And I&#039;m well aware that the cops bend the rules sometimes. I&#039;m a drug dealer. Believe me I&#039;ve had many encounters with the police. And for this reason, I know what is required for them to make a conviction. And it&#039;s not easy for them to do. Surveillance is a minor part of their battle. <br /><br />

It is unnecessary to involve a supernode because they have your plaintext (which is why &quot;logging&quot; is the right word vs &quot;intercept&quot;), although they have access to your session keys too if need be, and basically all manner of data is vacuumed out of your machine and into theirs.<br /><br />Like I have already said, I cannot know whether they are using Skype for mass surveillance, although this is to me a far from unlikely possibility. I do know they are using Skype as a resource to gather information on individuals. Given everything I have posted, I believe it would be a good move for SR users not to be using Skype to talk about the Silk Road, nor to have the program running in the background.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why would Skype be monitoring all your activity? Wouldn&#039;t it be easier if it was simply windows that did all the job? And I agree talking about SR on Skype or MSN or any conventional real-time chat client isn&#039;t a wise move, but if Skype went as far as keylogging, would it really stop doing so if you didn&#039;t let it run in the background? It&#039;s still interesting to know that Skype is monitoring your conversations, but I think they were basically telling you they were in their privacy policy, or they didn&#039;t tell you they didn&#039;t at least. Nobody should talk about about illegal stuff or the SR on conventional chat clients anyway, PGP or OTR should be used for that.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1047484#msg1047484">Quote from: pine on April 24, 2013, 04:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1036981#msg1036981">Quote from: tree on April 20, 2013, 10:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Your articles don&#039;t say anything about Skype being able to record your every keystroke when not using Skype.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just to let you know, I found a link which explains some of what I was getting at, in that there is no magic isolation between GUI programs on your desktop, most people, including computer people appear to assume there is, but there is not.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">There certainly is one thing that most Linux users don&#039;t realize about their Linux systems... this is the lack of GUI-level isolation, and how it essentially nullifies all the desktop security. I wrote about it a few times, I spoke about it a few times, yet I still come across people who don&#039;t realize it all the time.<br /><br />So, let me stress this one more time: if you have two GUI applications, e.g. an OpenOffice Word Processor, and a stupid Tetris game, both of which granted access to your screen (your X server), then there is no isolation between those two apps. Even if they run as different user accounts! Even if they are somehow sandboxed by SELinux or whatever! None, zero, null, nil!<br /><br />The X server architecture, designed long time ago by some happy hippies who just thought all the people apps are good and non-malicious, simply allows any GUI application to control any other one. No bugs, no exploits, no tricks, are required. This is all by design. One application can sniff or inject keystrokes to another one, can take snapshots of the screen occupied by windows belonging to another one, etc.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe me, I suggest you do a simple experiment. Open a terminal window, as normal user, and run xinput list, which is a standard diagnostic program for Xorg (on Fedora you will likely need to install it first: yum install xorg-x11-apps):<br /><br />$ xinput list<br /><br />It will show you all the pointer and keyboard devices that your Xorg knows about. Note the ID of the device listed as “AT keyboard” and then run (as normal user!):<br /><br />$ xinput test id<br /><br />It should now start displaying the scancodes for all the keys you press on the keyboard. If it doesn&#039;t, it means you used a wrong device ID.<br /><br />Now, for the best, start another terminal window, and switch to root (e.g. using su, or sudo). Notice how the xinput running as user is able to sniff all your keystrokes, including root password (for su), and then all the keystrokes you enter in your root session. Start some GUI app as root, or as different user, again notice how your xinput can sniff all the keystrokes you enter to this other app!<br /><br />http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.se/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Interesting article pine, it could explain this whole Skype keylogging thing but as I said before, if it were doing it, it would also be doing it while you&#039;re not running it.

				The DEA are nothing but Dick Eating Assholes.... they couldn&#039;t catch a cold if their lives depended on it, let alone a SR vendor who follows the proper code of conduct.&nbsp; <br /><br />And like it&#039;s been mentioned... why would they send you warning and give you a chance to clean house? They&#039;d bust your ass and try to get as much evidence as they could. <br /><br />Either the OP is trolling or some other vendor is trying to scare him off the road.

				It&#039;s some sort of half assed scam attempt or a psyops exercise by law enforcement or a hacker. It wasn&#039;t even that good and it got almost 5,000 views and scared the hell out of some noobiess and a couple of vendors. A precedent has been set regardless. <br /><br />It reminds me of this just lamer.<br /><br />http://www.you.tube.com/watch?v=n-bYe2vQOwU<br />

Like.. on Topix or something? Because that would be fucking retarded. <br /><br />Shit, there&#039;s a search bar in the main market. You can message any random ass username you can type in that search bar that matches an active account. <br /><br />Couldn&#039;t some sort of &quot;Alphabet Mafia&quot; troll or bot sit on Silk Road all day and try different words and combinations from, say an index of the top passwords and usernames from database hacks or a list and just harvest SR usernames all day and run them against Google or something?<br /><br />I&#039;ve already read in articles that the government has been monitoring IRC chats in real time. I can&#039;t see why in some sort of fucked up way of social engineering and shady shit it couldn&#039;t be possible for someone to link a SR username to an IP. <br /><br />Another question.. <br /><br />What kind of activity do you do regularly on your main browser.. (clearweb)<br /><br />Do you sit and stream bootleg movies and torrent songs or have any torrent programs or you know, buy drugs on topix? Do you have a Facebook full of weed references and sit around looking at erowid or weird fetish porn all day or something that would register as suspicious?<br /><br />Do you share an internet connection with anyone? <br /><br />Because I think it&#039;s within the possibility of reason that it could be pulled off. Especially on someone who doesn&#039;t know what the hell they&#039;re doing and just tries to figure out bitcoin and Silk Road because they heard about it and managed to get on once or twice.<br /><br />You need to know a decent amount of shit to fuck around on Silk Road and not derp up. <br /><br />Either OP is a troll or a derp.
