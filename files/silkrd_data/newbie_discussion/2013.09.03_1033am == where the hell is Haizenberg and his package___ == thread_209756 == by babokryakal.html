				I think you just have to be patient. I&#039;ve been reading the forums a lot, as well as spoke to him myself, and there&#039;s no doubt he&#039;s unprofessional (he should make the necessary actions when he goes travelling, which he did mid-August), but I don&#039;t think he&#039;s trying to scam us.
