				I was just interested to see how everyone stumbled upon the site. I had heard of the Silk Road through University! Someone was bold enough to mention it in my Poly Sci/Drug class asking the Professor if he had ever heard of it&nbsp; ;D Prior to that one of my buddies successfully ordered but I was just too lazy to try because I could get everything I wanted. Now that I am done with school and moved to a new location I was searching the web for possible online Pharms and it was all too sketchy! Then I remembered THE SILK ROAD! I swear people make it out to be a lot harder than it is. I don&#039;t know if anyone else feels the same but I was so skeptical about this at first and very hesitant to even research it until I did and now I feel like its extremely safe if used the right way. <br /><br />So let me here your stories (One way to pass the time while I await my first order!)

				I was looking for child pornography, but now I&#039;m addicted to drugs instead.<br /><br /><br />Nah, I&#039;ve known about the site for a long time, and I probably heard about it from a friend at some point. I wasn&#039;t really interested in drugs up until around last year and I&#039;ve been placing a few orders since then. I guess curiosity built up over time! I&#039;m still sober all the time, except for that one time every couple of months where I do psychedelics.

				I&#039;m pretty computer savvy and usually in the know of most things on the internet, but was surprised about the Road when my friend told me all about where he got such a great deal on some flowers, and explained to me how it all worked and how bitcoins worked an all.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely had my mind blown, first with the road and then with cryptocurrency.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the road is a genius idea and helps the lives of others actually.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I actually need flowers to get by with chronic pain, so thank you for the road, since it&#039;s very hard to get stuff with your confined in a house so the road is a lifesaver for me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; word of mouth is the best way to spread news!

				i think that fact is that if you do your search your getting quality goods and the way the site is set up using escrow it eliminates most of the risk involved... although you receive some scammers as long as your smart do the research and do your due diligence there really is nothing to worry about IMO i WAS JUST TERRIFIED that i wrote the wrong address encrypted i would be nice to see it in english but oh well just received my first package and it rocks!&nbsp;

				Well, recently I stumbled upon quite a few people doing psychedelics, including 2c-s and other. Not knowing what those are I felt the need to figure out, so I began doing research on the net. Then I found out what rc&#039;s are. I didn&#039;t do any drugs for like five years, and in the time I did, those were all classics.<br /><br />Then I ordered some aMT and similar from some kind of company in UK. Got it, tried it with the only acquaintance of mine which is interested in things, became disappointed. Went to the club, took shit loads of speed and ecstasy - remembered why I liked those long ago. In the morning I said &quot;dude, I wish I could do this more often, I miss that so so much&quot; and he said &quot;did you hear about this silk road, internet black market, things and stuff?&quot;, so I came home and found it.<br /><br />Now I know about rc&#039;s, tor, sr, bitcoins, mining and stuff. Funny when I think about it. ;D

				I have been buying drugs online since like 8 years (mail lists, private forums,etc) but the past 2 years I was clean and lost all the contacts. First I thought that will be so difficult to get again those kind of contacts and start doing some research and end installing Tor, buying bitcoins and the past December doing my first transaction on the road. At the moment all the transactions were fantastic and I had the luck to deal only with great sellers. SR is the best thing that ever happened to me cause I live in a country where is very very dangerous get drugs in the streets, and the quality of the street drugs here are the worst so SR is the only source I have for quality and safety.

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t really remember, I think main stream media followed by a google search. Probably watched a video tutorial on youtube also. Not interested in drugs or anything. I mostly come here out of curiosity. I have been thinking of buying some weight loss pills because i need to drop about 80. Maybe sell some liberators in the future ;) (wish i could patent that, no one sell liberators here but me ok? lol), and maybe some weed. (I have a few seeds). 8)

				I used to buy my weed from Budmail, that is until they screwed me over a 2oz order.<br /><br />I remembered reading about Silk Road in a Sunday paper a while ago, so did my research (thanks Google) and here I am.<br /><br />Waaaaaaaaaay better than Budmail. How I laughed when I heard the Liberty Reserve site closed down recently. BM will have lost a king&#039;s ransom because of that. <br /><br />Good, slap it up them.

				I was on a drug forum and they kept hinting that there was a special place that only senior members would get to hear about. But someone mentioned something that led to me finding SR over a year ago.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t believe how amazing this place is. I was like a kid in a candy store at first. I have settled down and now have a few things that I like to buy.&nbsp; I also love that I can research vendors and the drugs to make sure I am getting quality.&nbsp; This community is also getting very good at warning people if a drug might harm them or a vendor is not stealthy enough. This is so cool and I love being a part of it. ;D

				A lack of decent acid in my local scene brought me here. Now it&#039;s flowing again on ALL fronts ;)
