				So pretty new to sr and have made my first buy with something small to get my feet wet to how it works. After that went well I made another larger purchase with high hopes. This particular vendor is very new (~15 days), but after reading all the great reviews I felt comfortable going ahead with it. Well unlike all the reviews I read, he still hasn&#039;t shipped after 2 days and after dwelling on this the past 24 hrs I started to think that all those reviews could essentially be the vendor and/or someone he knows right? I have been going through re-reading all of them and I start noticing patterns consisting of two excellent reviews for his multiple products posted very close in time with each other. A lot of them even sound very similar in their tone, structure and wording.<br /><br />Am i paranoid or does this guy have all the attributes of a scammer? But even then what would he gain really because I did not FE or anything, so my BTC are still safe right?? Is there some motivation he might have to do this that I just don&#039;t see?<br /><br />Thanks for any insight offered!<br /><br />P.S. Here&#039;s the page in question:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1b33af9249

				Well, in a place where, supposedly, you cannot know the other party&#039;s identity...think about what one could do.<br />If no one can find you or hold you responsible for anything wrong you do, you can try to fool people all you want. Even if you do some &quot;honest&quot; business for a while, the very nature of this place will force to start anew. If you scam one person at a time you can keep opening new services and make a fortune &quot;one scam at a time&quot;.<br />So, I think it is very difficult to &quot;trust&quot; any services here.<br />Anyway, 2 days is not a lot of time, give it a little more time and see.<br />Good Luck,<br /><br />Kilroy

				Don&#039;t s i learned on SR.<br /><br />Don&#039;t pick new vendors for big purchases. They start small and earn credibility.<br /><br />Don&#039;t assume. Trust is all we have. <br /><br />Don&#039;t FE. Ever. As long as you didn&#039;t FE you could get all or a portion of your coins back.<br /><br /><br />And if you can&#039;t afford to buy it, then don&#039;t buy it.

				Are you the same guy who asked about this yesterday? if not there was someone else who ordered and it hadnt been shipped yet. If you dont FE the most common scam is the 50% one where they offer you 50% refund you take it and they get half the order for nothing happens alot now it seems.<br /><br />When looking at feedback look at the transactions a buyer has 10+ in all catagorys says the buyer is prob legit not always but prob 1+ in all except btc then 0 most likely first buy so could easily be fake <br /><br />As said in above comment if not shipped by time to cancel appears msg the vendor telling them you plan on canceling before you do as some vendors actually put it in the box then come back and mark it shipped so to avoid problems give them some warning before you do

				Your probably OK. Most scammers try to:<br />1- build a customer base<br />2- gain their confidence<br />3- bend them over<br />4- fuckem hard <br /><br />&nbsp;This guy is skipping steps 1 + 2 if he&#039;s a scammer with 14 days and 39 transactions.

				No this is my first post here and i just wanted some veteran insight into this deal. I can afford the to take the 50% hit, and if it turns out that way then I will consider my second purchase on the road to be that of wisdom. <br /><br />So the 50% resolution deal would be if he sent something in the mail, even if it&#039;s just capsules of ginkgo biloba?

				well they wont neccesarily send anything thats the point of the 50% scam they say they did, didnt and get 50% of the money for nothing. As they are so new they cant ask for FE and if they do report them as its a break of the vendor rules apart from that wait till the cancel option appears and msg them before cancelling incase they have sent it and not marked it and also remember if its hedged you might get less coins but the same dollar amount if cancelled&nbsp;

It doesn&#039;t count as a refund if your order is cancelled. Your refund rate will stay at 0%.<br /><br />If you have to go to resolution and you win, I think it might. I&#039;m not sure because in 2 years of buying, I&#039;ve only entered resolution one time. I ended up extending the time, the package came a few days later, and I promptly finalized. Maybe someone else can answer to that part.<br /><br />As a side note, f a vendor shorts your order and sends you some coin to make up for it (you can send coin to any member), that doesn&#039;t count against your refund rate either. And that&#039;s only happened to me twice, once last year and once this year.<br /><br />There really are a ton of awesome vendors on here if you choose carefully and follow your instinct.

				It sounds like he&#039;s padding his feedback, which is sketchy, but as long as you don&#039;t FE you should be fine.<br /><br />Would I want to do business with someone who creates fake feedback? Not particularly.

				update:<br /><br />so the seller in question sent me a message a couple days ago stating that a package was sent out and provided me a tracking number, said it should be delivered by Wednesday. I am still suspicious tho, and today I noticed that he has taken down that particular listing but still has his other three up. Working thru a web-proxy and a third-party tracking site, the tracking number cannot be found which only strengthens my growing suspicions. Perhaps the tracking number isn&#039;t available until it is scanned in by the PO, which should be by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. So if nothing with the tracking number changes by tomorrow, I will know my answer. <br /><br />wish i was a poor, punk-ass bitch with no integrity whatsoever so i could post up some listings, leave myself some 5.0 ratings and trap some newbs into giving me some bitcoins. <br /><br />on a side note: I am listing some magic pills which will make turn your penis into a 10 inch black dong over night! Get em while their hot!

Two things:1.&nbsp; USPS isn&#039;t known for rapidly updating it&#039;s tracking numbers (especially in the early stages of mailing). I&#039;ve had non-SR packages that say &quot;Sender is preparing package for delivery&quot; until the same morning they hit my local PO. And 2., you&#039;re using a 3rd party tracking site; it could be that they aren&#039;t up to date. None of that means anything, nor will it tell you anything tomorrow.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that you&#039;re overreacting or that you didn&#039;t get beat. You&#039;re just worried about something you&#039;re powerless to change. And there&#039;s nothing you can do about it tomorrow.<br /><br />If the tracking number were fake/non-existent, he wouldn&#039;t have a very good case in resolution. It has to correspond to some package, whether yours or not, in order for it to be marked delivered or non-deliverable. A fake number only hurts your vendor&#039;s case.<br /><br />Just relax for now; I know the first buy is stressful, but it&#039;s out of your hands.<br />

Here&#039;s the page in question:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1b33af9249<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I missed this part. Ummmm yeah, you got beat. I&#039;ve been watching this seller. I was tempted to give him a try, but he&#039;s the only vendor I&#039;ve ever seen selling &quot;amphetamine sulfate capsules.&quot; And now he&#039;s just selling pure powder, which to me would also be suspicious. It&#039;s also not a very common name for generic Adderall (although there is such a thing). I&#039;m not saying that the package won&#039;t come, but I doubt it&#039;s pure amphetamine salts.<br /><br />Now, let me get this straight: you&#039;re buying amphetamine powder? Loose? In the US? I wouldn&#039;t do that. <br />The street value for Adderall is $1 per MG. For the 0.5 g /500 mg item, he&#039;s charging only $60. He only wants $300 for 3.5 fucking GRAMS of PURE amphetamine? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh OK; and I&#039;m fucking Santa Claus. That&#039;s the deal of the fucking century.&nbsp; <br /><br />You need to be doing more research on the drugs if you&#039;re buying prescriptions. There&#039;s a plethora of information about prescription drugs available online. And it wouldn&#039;t hurt to poke around in the forums to see if an offer seems too good to be true BEFORE you make the buy! Or even to find out street prices if you don&#039;t know them.&nbsp; Learn from this!

				Never stress if it takes a vendor several days to mark your order in transit. Defintely not a sign of a scam. There are so many reasons that it could take a few days. Your on a list, their waiting on their own product, care in packaging, or suprise, suprise they aren&#039;t plugged into sr 24 hours a day. As other have stated pay close attention to the particular feedback you are reading also. Someone with a $100 buying stat has less experience on the road then someone with higher. So review those carefully and use some logic. If the vendor does cancel, big deal at least they giving you back your btc without affecting your rating and vice versa. Patience and common sense are key on here at all times.

				well he got me because I&#039;m new and didn&#039;t think ahead enough to realize that all those reviews could be fake. That dawned on me at some point later on after i purchased it. The capsules is what i purchased and it was around 7 dollars or so for 30mg, and considering that I wasn&#039;t expecting it to be pure amp it seemed reasonable to me. Price for pharmaceutical grade&nbsp; amp seems to be around 20 bucks for 30mg.&nbsp; Even those prices are hard to pay for me because i get 30 x 20mg IR adderall from the pharmacy for less than 50 bucks. Wish I didn&#039;t like em so much or i would sell them on SR and make a killin. Also have vyvanse which seems to be pretty popular.<br /><br />anyways, glad someone took the time to check out the listing cause i just wanted a second opinion if i got scammed cause i was 90% sure i did, now im at 99%.... thanks<br /><br />also, the feedbacks were varying on his listings, ranging from buyers with $10+ to $1000+...

Those amphetamine prices or ridiculously cheap and are ungodly quantities. Seriously, $60 for 1000 mg of pure amphetamine powder? <br /><br />If that shit&#039;s real, then back a fucking tractor-trailer up to my fucking front door please! I&#039;ve never seen someone sell it as powder or for that matter admit that they are packing their own capsules. It&#039;s usually sold as a paste or in pill form. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s not possible to possess amphetamine powder, but it&#039;s rare on SR and even rarer in the US at large.<br /><br />I do think the package will arrive, but think the product is going to be bunk. It has a tracking number, so the vendor is going to submit that as proof of delivery. Then they will argue over the quality of the product. I&#039;m not sure that he would get a full refund in that case (I&#039;ve never been through resolution and have never recieved fake products though).

				I read this thread and have to admit I&#039;d be skeptical of this vendor also, mainly due to the short time they have been selling.<br />The one thing that gets me, though, is all of the +10 btc patrons leaving reviews...<br />I mean, either this guy is loaded and buys a whole helluva lot of drugs on multiple accounts, or there are multiple people involved in the scam.. or maybe I&#039;m not giving them enough credit.. maybe they make so much damn money off the scam they can afford to have all of those dummy accounts with 10+btc on their stats..<br />Still, I wouldn&#039;t be buying amphetamines anyway.. if I wanted that I&#039;d buy meth..

When you place an order, the very last column of the order page says cancel. When you make the purchase, it&#039;s greyed out and you can&#039;t click it. If you hover your mouse over the word cancel, however, the number of days after which you can cancel will pop&nbsp; up in a small box. After exactly 96 hours from the time you place your order, the word cancel becomes green and is clickable. Simply click it and your coins are automatically returned to your wallet.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised to hear that&#039;s not in the buyer&#039;s guide because you can; don&#039;t take my word for it, see for yourself.

				For all your first buys, I&#039;d recommend buying lots of cheap things (under 20 dollars for each buy)<br /><br />And don&#039;t buy from someone that new. Ever. Unless they&#039;re offering a sample or something for $2. That way, well, you only lose that dinky amount of money, so no foul.<br /><br />And I recommend the large amount of small orders so the sellers can trust YOU too. Then you never have to FE.<br /><br />And if they require FE after many buys, then they&#039;re either paranoid or a scammer, so don&#039;t do it.
