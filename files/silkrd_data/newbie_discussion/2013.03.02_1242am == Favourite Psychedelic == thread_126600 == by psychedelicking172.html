				I&#039;ve only tried 20x Salvia, if that counts. I slid down a talking metal zipper and then someone in the shadows was talking to me, calming me while I couldn&#039;t get up... really weird shit. I felt fine afterwards but never tried any psychedelics since.

				I only have experience with LSD and Shrooms. I just trust those because of the history. A lot of this other stuff like DMT, salvia, Bath salts, seem kind of little studies and trials have been done.<br /><br />Just my opinion based on track record. I like shrroms because they are mild and will eventually let me sleep. LSD is great when I want to really &quot;go somewhere&quot; but man I hate the comedown.

				What&#039;s the comedown from LSD like? Do shrooms make your nauseous or is the whole experience mostly pleasant?<br /><br />I did extracted salvia without a sitter; I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Although, I&#039;d be surprised if anyone could make it outside. I feel straight to the ground and woke up in a slightly different spot on the floor after a 15min trip. As many people have described, after the trip it feels strange like someone is trying to talk to you. Then you get really hot and sweat profusly for 20mins.

				I usually do 1-2 hits of blotter/paper LSD and am very aware of my surroundings. Get some mild visuals and some serious fucking laughs, but I do not black out, lose time, or anything crazy.<br /><br />The most I have ever done was 7, and I did it in anger after getting 2 bunk hits, bought a fiuve strip and threw it on my tongue, then about 10 minutes later the bunk stuff started to kick in, and then the fiver.... woah. I had lots of visuals and kind of felt like I was &quot;speeding?&quot; Couldn&#039;t really make any sense to people. <br /><br />The comedown to me is I feel kind of icky, a slight migraine, and just want to sleep, but can&#039;t fall asleep.

				hi, shrooms can make you nauseous - but depends on your stomach i guess; <br />until now i didn&#039;t have too many problems in that regard, i just try not to eat anything or only little breakfast, when taking them the same evening<br />also, i would recommend dried sclerotia (so called &quot;truffels&quot;), for they always gave me a very lucid experience and i never had any nausea problems; <br />there are quite a variety of different strains and species of magic mushrooms (the active compound being psilocin/psilocybin), <br />and some of them, like the more commonly used/sold &quot;cubensis&quot; species (because they are easy to cultivate) don&#039;t provide me with the same mental clarity that the truffels do<br />in small doses the experience is very similar to lsd (they are both in the same family of psychoactive chemicals and dock to the same neuroreceptor sites), but only lasting about half as long (3-4 hours)<br /><br />lsd on the other hand never provided me with any nausea, and for introduction into the world of psychedelics might also be more convenient, <br />as with magic mushrooms it might be difficult in the beginning to differentiate all that is all being sold under the label &quot;magic mushrooms&quot;, <br />at least it was for me <br />so some background knowledge might not be worst idea, then you could even cultivate them yourself<br /><br />i could definitely understand your reservation towards psychedelics when coming from salvia - it&#039;s a completely unrelated experience though, so no worries.<br />to me it is one of the most fulfilling experiences i can think of, and it comes without any serious risks involved

I just trust those because of the history. A lot of this other stuff like DMT, salvia, Bath salts, seem kind of little studies and trials have been done.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Bath salts and the drugs in them are definitely unknown in terms of safety, but DMT and Salvia have most likely been around longer than the humans. Seriously both have been used in shamanic ceremonies in many primitive cultures since the beginning of recorded human history. Neither of them are for everybody, especially salvia, but both are pretty damn safe.<br /><br />Personally I hate Salvia, but one time I smoked Salvia while on the peak of my first ever LSD experience (6 tabs, but it was known to be weak acid), and the nature of the salvia was completely different than any other time I tried it. It was honestly a really great trip, and I recommend everyone try Salvia on the peak of another psychedelic at least once.<br /><br />About DMT, the only dangerous part of doing DMT is if you make an Ayahuasca brew that involves MAOI&#039;s and you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing and what/ when you can and cannot eat. Pure DMT, on the other hand, is one of the safest drugs known to man. If you smoke too much, you simply black out and don&#039;t remember the experience. It is possible that DMT is naturally bio-synthesized&nbsp; in most if not all known life forms, and is even thought to be released in humans immediately before death and when we sleep (which would explain why we have dreams). There have also been many scientific studies of DMT done with humans and other animals (watch the documentary DMT: The Spirit Molecule if you want to learn more, last time I checked it&#039;s still on Netflix). And by the way, DMT is by far my favorite psychedelic&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Anyways, I have a lot of experience with many different psychedelics (I&#039;ve lost count, but it&#039;s probably over 20 or so). Here&#039;s a list of my top 5:<br /><br />1. DMT (smoked, but Ayahuasca would probably be amazing)<br />2. Psilocybin/ Psilocin<br />3. LSD<br />4. 2C-B<br />5. This one changes a lot, but right now I am really liking 5-MEO-DIPT<br /><br />Realistically I have a top 10 list, but top 5 is easier to place and more consistent over time. There&#039;s a couple psychedelics that I haven&#039;t tried that almost certainly would knock on or two of these out of their top 5 spot, such as Mescaline, DOM, or 2C-T-7, but for now it is what it is.

				Very curious about trying a psychedelic just not sure which one. I am completely terrified of having a bad trip. I heard the 2C family is recommended for first timers. Also just how&nbsp; bad can a bad trip be? I read one story of someone walking down the street and everyone&#039;s head had been replaced with squids.

				I think it really depends what I&#039;m looking to experience at that point in time. Boomers are my overall favorite, while DMT is more saved for the occasional profound mind-expandingfuck. All the L I&#039;ve had has either been weak or bunk, so I don&#039;t want to put my .02 on that just yet. HBWR seeds were very mild and pleasant, aside from the absolutely horrible nausea I experienced on the come-up. Never stuff yourself on chips and salsa and go hike 4 1/2 miles coming up on HBWR.
