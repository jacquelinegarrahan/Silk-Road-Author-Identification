				Check out the newbie PGP club sticky thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0<br />Use something user friendly like GPG4USB. That&#039;s fairly simple.

				Alright a step by step guide on PGP.<br /><br />1. Go to this website http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html and download the PGP program. <br /><br />2. When you run it for the first time you will be prompted to make a &quot;profile&quot;<br /><br />3. Make your profile any name you like and attach it to any email you like real or fake. (When you give someone this key they will see the email ... so they could email you there or vise versa you could email your vendor in a last hope if the SR gets taken down.) <br /><br />4.&nbsp; At the end of this process you will be asked to save something this file contains your private and your public key SAVE THIS FILE ON A FLASH DRIVE AND HIDE IT IN A HOLE IN THE WOODS 50 MILES FROM YOUR HOUSE!!!! lol JK but keep it on a flash drive off your computer. ( you can regenerate it later if you lose it for whatever reason)<br /><br />5. Now go to your lovely vendors page and find there public key Copy and Paste the ENTIRE thing including the little (----- PUBLIC PGP BLABLA ------) into the starting page of the program where you should see you account. (To make this more specific ctrl+c is copy ctrl+v is paste clicking on the PGP program and hitting ctrl+v should paste the key there and add it if all else fails select &quot;Keys&quot; at the top of the window and select &quot;New Key...&quot; and add it that way.) Now you should see your profile along with your vendors.<br /><br />6. Still with me? Good.... if not...well I&#039;ll deal with that later. Now select the clipboard icon at the top of the PGP program. This will open a note pad style blank page. <br /><br />7. Typedy type type your message away make sure the FULL NAME and FULL ADDRESS (of your friends house NEVER your own house is correct just as it comes on there bills cause that&#039;s all your package is right your mothers knitting supplies from Amazon) this aint no kindergarten we use correct capitalization and punctuation here on the Deep Web.<br /><br />Ex:<br />Mary W. Jane<br />420 S. Green St.<br />Cannabis Village, CA 89042<br /><br />*****Why your friends house I say?&nbsp; While your mail takes a warrant to open so the chance that it ever does is already very slim (vendors take measures to make sure your mail looks like all the other MILLIONS of mail flowing through the post office to further decrease the chance of that happening) in the very worst case but there always being the .1% of chance we can&#039;t entirely throw out of the realm of possibles and the mail man happens to bump into a man dressed in a black suit driving a government issue black suv that &quot;happens&quot;to have a knife that by some god created miracle cuts open the package and the 2 layers of heat sealed bags enclosing your product and decides he should pay your&nbsp; friend a visit they are covered by &quot;Plausible Dependability&quot; this means as long as they don&#039;t keep their bongs/vapes/pipes in clear view of the front door and the house dosen&#039;t smell like an underground growing farm when the guy in black comes back with the warrant to search the house after being told very nicely he&#039;s not welcome and there is no evidence (ie: previous packages and no SR on there computer) because your friend never ordered any drugs and has no idea how said package came to have his name on it they will be forced to let him go. Remember to educate your self and your friends on the law and never be suckered into &quot;you could be facing xx years if you don&#039;t tell us what we want or we use what ever we think we&#039;ve found to harass you into confessing because that&#039;&#039;s the only way we&#039;ll get actual proof.******<br /><br />8. Now that were all done typing select the button that says &quot;Encrypt&quot;<br /><br />9. Now select the vendor your sending your message to.<br /><br />10. Now click on &quot;ok&quot;<br /><br />11. Tada you have now &#039;fully encrypted your message to your vendor just copy and paste your message in it&#039;s entirety yes the little &quot;---- PGP blabla-----&quot; thing included into your SR message along with your Public key NOT the Private key but the PUBLIC key only in it&#039;s entirety and if you have caught on you know what that means.&nbsp; Then hit send and your all done. Your vendor adds your key and gets your message.<br /><br />** I may be mistaken on this last bit if someone can confirm if they need your public key or not that would complete this guide I do just to make sure they can decrypt it and they can encrypt things they need to send to me all though most just friendly messages back and forth between vendor and costumer will not be in PGP I started always using and they never did so I stopped.***

				PGP is not needed in order to make a purchase. You can contact your vendor to request that they use privnote. Don&#039;t flame me regarding privnote. I know that it has a certain measurable degree of vulnerability but the degree is negligible.

				okay but if im sending it to someone elses house other than mine, wouldnt the need for encryption be pointless? if they can just deny it and theres no proof they did anything but got a weird package they never asked for, there should be no need to hide their info. (if im wrong PLEEASE tell me haha). <br /><br />also, should i be creating my localbitcoins.com and extra ewallet accounts on my tor browser or my regular explorer? ive also seen people say using a public computer to create these accounts is smart (makes sense to me). i know these are probly a little too paranoid of questions but i dont like to take any chances with shit like this. any info is much appreciated!

I mean just cause she&#039;s on birth control dosen&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t wear a condom you could have sex 1111 billion times and never pull out but on that day of days when the stars a line and some Apache Indian is dancing outside your house BAM your a daddy.... and if someone you don&#039;t want to have your friends address gets it you can&#039;t just abort it. That being said if they where able to intercept the message who&#039;s to say they can&#039;t find you? The ultimate goal being that you don&#039;t get found out and your computer dosen&#039;t get seized searched through and bla bla your screwed. <br /><br />Again only takes one why wouldn&#039;t you take extra measures for security. <br /><br />Mmm you can do either or it dosen&#039;t matter again that part is legal but again making them through tor extra protection. <br /><br />When I&#039;m ever questioned by my methods of security or my own paranoid precautions I reply &quot;Better to be paranoid now then being forced to be later on, so when you are you have years of practice and it is no longer being paranoid but a part of your everyday life.&quot;
