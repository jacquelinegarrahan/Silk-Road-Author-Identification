				<br /><br />Hello SR<br /><br />I recently purchased New America&#039;s MDMA (1g)<br /><br />I am messaging you because what he is selling is not mdma.<br /><br />He is scamming people.<br /><br />What he is actually selling is a chemical called &quot;MDP-2-P&quot; also called &quot;Piperonylacetone&quot;<br /><br />MDP-2-P is a sassafras-smelling oil that is yellow colored.<br /><br />New America&#039;s product is bright yellow crystals ... Not anywhere near the color in his picture.<br /><br />The chemical is similar ... it&nbsp; has 4 carbon analogues of a mdma but these are totally inactive.<br /><br />Since the structure of this chemical is similar to mdma, a cheap testing kit will show positive results for mdma.<br /><br />If however it is tested by a professional lab/ chemists it will prove to be MDP-2-P.<br /><br />SR should not be allowed to sell imitation drugs.<br /><br />I hope you take this message seriously because MDP-2-P is a dangerous chemical and is known to produce undesiarble effects such as hallucinations, panic attacks, and convulsions.<br /><br />I tested it out and it was by no means an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />It causes visual distortions/hallucinations similar to low doses of lsd... Molly is not supposed to produce hallucinations.<br /><br />I would also like to add that that it has a very strong/ speedy come up... and a horrible comedown.<br /><br />The hangover the next day is similar to drinking two liters of vodka.<br /><br /><br /><br />This shit sucks...<br /><br />Never buying from this vendor again.

				First, let me say that I&#039;ve never tried New America&#039;s MDMA, so can&#039;t comment on that, however, I&#039;d like to know how you concluded that what you have is MDP2P.<br /><br />MDP2P is common precursor to MDMA and MDA. It&#039;s not known to be psychoactive in and of itself. It&#039;s also a controlled substance that isn&#039;t easy to get. I doubt that a vendor would try to it as substitute for MDMA. <br /><br />see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyphenylpropan-2-one<br /><br />Also, all the symptoms you described are ones that can occur with a high dose of pure MDMA for some people.<br />

				I was sort of at a loss at to what I was feeling with NewAmerica&#039;s MDMA until I saw this post. Thank you. It would be nice to know if you actually did test it pr if this is just a suspicion. <br /><br />Anyway it seems to be speedier feeling than MDMA (which is usually quite sedating for me) and produces more of a hangover the next day. It certainly shares more MDMA-like properties than methylone does. Hopefully someone is able to do a more advanced test on this stuff.<br /><br />

				Yes I agree with you guys, I made a post regarding to his brown/tan batch. It was one of the strangest feelings ever.<br /><br />I posted here.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178977.msg1295908#msg1295908<br /><br />But don&#039;t get me wrong, he gave me QUALITY stuff and it was the hardest i ever rolled with pure euphoria only have 0.1.<br />This brown/tan batch was pretty disappointing though :c<br /><br />It&#039;s just a heads up because I didn&#039;t like it when i tried it.

				You could send a sample to http://www.ecstasydata.org/ for testing. Unfortunately, it costs $140 for anything other than pressed tablets, but it would tell you exactly what&#039;s in it, although not in what quantities. <br /><br />Without testing who knows what&#039;s going on. I&#039;m not even sure that TheRoller used a home test kit, although the implication is that he did and that it passed. It would be nice to know which reagents he used and see some photos of the results.<br /><br />Again, MD2P2P (aka PMK oil) is a popular precursor to MDMA manufacture. I doubt it is being sold as a substitute for MDMA although it could certainly be present as a byproduct in a poorly conducted synthesis.<br /><br />BTW, for those interested in such things, this paper details some of the common impurities found when producing MDMA from 3 popular routes.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/mdma.impurity.study.html<br />&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t taken the tan gram I bought from NewAmerica yet, but I did test it using Marques, Mecke and Simons from my DancSafe kit and they all tested perfect. The only possible oddity was that the Marques test looked more like a very dark brown than a black and it shifted to a dark black with purple tint after 5 minutes. I want to stress though that my kit is over a year old and I got the same result when I tested some crumbs of a previous awesome bean I had. The other two tests went immediately to black purple with bubbles and turquoise on the other. NewAmerica is a long time seller with a loyal following and a great reputation for quality, speed and stealth. He doesn&#039;t appear to participate on the forum, but I can attest that he&#039;s friendly and responsive to any questions sent directly. I would advise that anyone with any worries or concerns contact him directly and I think you&#039;ll be pleasantly surprised by his honestly and willingness to discuss the pro&#039;s and cons of his various offerings.&nbsp; &nbsp;
