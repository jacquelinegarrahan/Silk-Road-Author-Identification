				Well I made an order from the seller thecandykingdom. He had alright reviews and they were looking better as of recent. Anyways I placed the order but he didn&#039;t hedge the funds. Now bitcoin has dropped about 20-25%. I have tried to send him a couple messages. It has been 5 days so far now (4 since i sent a message being like I am a legit customer and want the order and read through his profile and did as he asked).<br /><br />Anyways the messages are in bold print when I look at the sent section. Does this mean he didn&#039;t read them? I had another one that wasn&#039;t bold print. I was wondering should I cancel my order soon? How much more time should I give him? <br /><br />Honestly I want the product he has and don&#039;t want to have to take the loss. I feel he may have noticed the price drop and is not filling the order because of this effectively gambling with my bitcoin without having to take a loss. Could me just being paranoid but he says he normally ships in 24-48 hours and I know he has been online at least 3 times since. Once probably to check orders, once to change his PGP and go stealth and he accidently left it blank and another time to actually repost it.<br /><br />Also how will that affect my buyers stats?<br /><br />I am probably just over thinking this (just cancel and cut my loss) but would like other peoples input before proceeding any further.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.<br /><br />NextTime

				I heard some vendor are doing that. I can&#039;t say as I blame them, I mean who wants to take like a 25% hit. Although the vendor should have hedged then if s/he was worried about it. But generally in industry the order is not an order until the vendor accepts it; just placing an order doesn&#039;t guarantee a vendor will accept.

				So should I attempt to report the vendor for fraudulent practices? He could have replied. He still could have canceled. I am still really unsure what to do. He went to stealth mode and I am frustrated. Not only will I take a loss on the bitcoins but also the SR fee. And like you said he should have hedged. If I had the choice I certainly would have for him but I didn&#039;t. It should be a requirement now days with bitcoin fluctuation. The only reason not to would be to screw over would be clients such as I feel may be happening in this case.

				Well once it hits 4 days you can cancel it yourself as long as it still says &#039;processing&#039; and not &#039;in transit&#039;.

				I know I can cancel but I don&#039;t know if I am just being paranoid and the vendor has been busy and missed it or he is purposely dodging me. Is it typical to not hear back and him not cancel?

				We are afraid that not much can be done.<br />Money is in hands of vendor so all that have left for you is hoping for the BTC price will go up or asking to get your money back.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT

				The vendor is going to take the loss, not you. He will get the bitcoins that are in escrow now. No more will be taken from your account.<br /><br />Also, the bold print means he didn&#039;t read your messages.

				It should never take a vendor more than 4 days to ship. Most vendors will ship in under 3 days. Things do happen though. Maybe your vendor is out of stock and restocking even. If you want to cancel the order, just cancel it. I&#039;m sure there won&#039;t be any hard feelings since you could always reorder.

				After your 4 days or whatever is up, and if you haven&#039;t gotten response back from the vendor. That way you can move on to another vendor, and get what it is you want. Just my opinion, because 4 days or more is way too long to have to wait, even for a busy(popular) vendor.

There are some unwritten guidelines to follow on SR that should probably be in docs presented to people who are starting out. Like for example, you should always leave a vendor a 5/5 rating unless there is a significant problem with your order, since it effects their rating. It&#039;s common for people ordering bud their first time to leave a 4/5 because the quality of the bud is not what they expected and that should not happen.
