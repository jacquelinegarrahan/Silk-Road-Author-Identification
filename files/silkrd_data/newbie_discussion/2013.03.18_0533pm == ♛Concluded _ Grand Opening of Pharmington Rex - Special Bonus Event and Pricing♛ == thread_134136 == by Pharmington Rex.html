The other separate order transactions will not be eligible. And here again the number of eligible <br />patrons remaining is only decreased by one since it is merely the same patron placing multiple separate orders. <br /><br />In other words, all items placed in a patron&#039;s shopping cart and ordered at the same time count as a singular transaction <br />with each item placed in the patron&#039;s shopping cart being eligible to receive a bonus quantity. Multiple or subsequent <br />order transactions placed by the same patron will result in only the first transaction being eligible to receive a bonus <br />quantity. The subsequent order transactions placed by the same patron will not be eligible to receive a bonus quantity and <br />thus the number of eligible patrons remaining is only decreased by one.<br /><br />⌖ Those individuals who partook in our sample giveaway are also eligible to participate in this Grand Opening event bonus <br />giveaway.<br /><br />⌖ Given the nature of TOR connections, if the number of eligible patrons remaining is 2 or less at the time a patron places <br />an order, we would make a reasonable allowance at our discretion for extending the Special Bonus Quantity offer to a <br />patron&#039;s order if by the time they actually submitted the order, the number of eligible patrons remaining had recently <br />dropped to 0 before they actually submitted their order.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />●ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ●<br /><br />✧Vendor Profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a10e537301<br /><br />Do take the time to read it.

				⚠ ●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●URGENT NOTICE:●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●⚠<br /><br />CONCERNING US ADDERALL STOCK... <br />&nbsp;<br />⚠ Do to the enormous and unanticipated demand for our Adderall product over the course of the weekend, our US supply has been outstripped and is unable to properly meet the sum total of demand. This applies to most Adderall orders placed after 17:00 UTC on Friday, 22 March, 2013. (The larger the order, the more likely this applies to you even though FIFO [first in - first out] would seem fairest. Though, we may simply default to FIFO since technically, these earliest patrons would experience the longer wait by virtue of the date and time order was placed). <br /><br />However, we have in place the means in which to execute delivery of your order from our amply stocked UK division which we were preparing to initiate at the beginning of next month for UK customers. Sending you your order from our UK division will add an additional 2 to 3 days on top of what you were expecting for delivery making for a total delivery time of 4 to 6 days from today, Monday 25 March 2013. <br /><br />NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SIGN FOR ORDERS COMING FROM THE UK. <br /><br />All orders for Adderall placed during this week will be shipped from our UK division until our US division is properly stocked - an event we anticipate occurring on or before Monday 1 April, 2013.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not the end of the world but not the most ideal of circumstances. And it speaks ill of our initial operating protocols. We openly, though shamefully admit that. <br /><br />As compensation for our error to properly anticipate demand and popularity of our US operations, we will add an additional quantity to your order that is coming from the UK on top of the bonus you were already set to receive. So in a way, it&#039;s a blessing in disguise if you can see the glass as half full.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another bonus is that you will NOT have to sign for the package upon arrival. Our stealth for transcontinental packages from the UK to US is such that we do not anticipate a single customs seizure. Our experience in having done so in the past in our other operation prior to SR confirms this. <br /><br />Tracking will not be available until Wednesday, 27 March, 2013 at the earliest. At that time you may request tracking information for your parcel placed during the span of the weekend. Orders placed during this week will have a 2 day delay for tracking information availability from the date of order.<br /><br />We apologize for our oversight and hope that our additional quantity added to your order on top of the bonus you were already set to receive will stand as proper compensation for the delay. We also beg your pardon in this matter and hope that it will not sully the prospect of future business. <br /><br />As you can see, we have contingencies in place to handle many situations we may suddenly find ourselves in. It is our hope that you take into account our foresight to have such contingencies in place in order to continue operations, albeit with a modest delay, and our willingness to compensate for our error without prompting that will instill in you a measure of trust and forestall a loss of confidence or loss of credibility. <br /><br />As there were no other large to bulk sized Adderall suppliers on SR from whose sales we could make accurate projections of demand from, we entered new territory without having&nbsp; such information and we simply were found to have underestimated. <br /><br />Experience is an austere teacher, because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards. <br /><br />Going forward, seeing how much demand US customers have for our Adderall product, you can rest assured that we will overstock Adderalls in such a manner as to never find ourselves in this sort of situation again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Signed, <br /><br />♚ The Right Honourable Lord Wellington of Xanaxia<br /><br />⚠●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●END NOTICE●▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●⚠
