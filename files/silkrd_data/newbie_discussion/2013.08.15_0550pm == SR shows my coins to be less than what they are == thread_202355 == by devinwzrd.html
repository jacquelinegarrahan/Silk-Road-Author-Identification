				ok i have 2.0733 btc on my account. according to preev (mt.gox) it says my coins are worth 230 USD, whereas SR says they&#039;re only 216 USD, which is keeping me from ordering what i planned on ordering. what causes this and how can it be fixed?

				This has to do with the fact that MT Gox has always had an inflated rate, &amp; SR finally adjusted it&#039;s rate based on several other exchanges so the vendors weren&#039;t consistently getting hosed when they tried to cash out at 10% below MG since most cannot use MG to cash out from.<br /><br />So all along most buyers have had a up to 10% advantage over the vendors, so some adjustments have been made.&nbsp; Figure out a way to get coin from other exchanges that has lower cost btc rates like right now, MG&#039;s rates are $111.00 &amp; BTCE is $96.00 &amp; SR is $104.66&nbsp; &nbsp;so buy from BTCE &amp; you are money ahead!<br /><br />NCK

Isn&#039;t the bitcoin the currency your using? Not the money that you paid for the bitcoin. Like if I pay $90 to bitinstant for 1 bitcoin and I put it in my SR wallet, SR will adjust my bitcoin to .9 BTC because it knows I payed $90 and SR thinks BTC costs $100? That doesn&#039;t seem to add up, how does SR even know how much I paid for the BTC, who I bought it from, and when I bought it?
