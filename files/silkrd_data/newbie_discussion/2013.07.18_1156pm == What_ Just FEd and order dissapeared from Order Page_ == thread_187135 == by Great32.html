				Never ever FE!<br /><br />But to answer your question; The order page only shows pending orders.<br />If you want to see your order history, or change your feedback (you should do this after receiving and trying the order), you have to click on &quot;account&quot;, and you will find everything to the right, (View feedback, purchasing stats, account history).<br /><br />Hope this helps.?

Most people here hate fe&#039;ing, and you will get no sympathy if you fe and something adverse happens. Personally, I never ask for fe, but I&#039;m not totally against it for trusted vendors. Do your research!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In response to your question, go to your account page and click view feedback, you can edit from there,&nbsp; good luck, AB.

When you join SR, there is information which MUST be read if you intend on using the site. Beginning with DPR&#039;s &quot;a few words from the Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;, if a buyer was to read this they would immediately be aware of 2 very important points made by DPR which are imperative to using the site successfully. 1 is Staying in Escrow and 2 is Read the Forum and Wiki. If the OP had of read through the guidelines and comprehended what was written, there would have been no need to ask these questions. How can anyone use a website like this safely without the basic knowledge required to do so? This isn&#039;t a game!! Security and maintaining your anonymity are the top priorities you need to sort out first before even considering placing an order. Be patient and don&#039;t rush into something until you, at a bare minimum, have a basic understanding of how things work.<br /><br />Hey Chemy.&nbsp; :) ;)

Read the entire wikia, buyer and vendor guides to gain a general knowledge about how the system works. Then maybe you could resume.
