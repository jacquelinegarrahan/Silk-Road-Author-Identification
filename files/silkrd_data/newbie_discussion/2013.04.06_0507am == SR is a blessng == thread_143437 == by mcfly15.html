				For a person like me, also a newbie, SR is everythng I have ever wished for.&nbsp; I&#039;m from an area where shady people sell crappy... CRAPPY bud for 400 an ounce... it&#039;s bullshit.&nbsp; I had quite an addiction to pain killers and xanax for about 8 years and smoked bud on the side if it was around.&nbsp; After near death experiences I knew I had to change so I went to rehab... 8 months out of rehab I noticed my anxiety had increased and pain from old sports injuries where really coming back to haunt me.&nbsp; I smoked a joint of White widow and knew that if I never wanted to be the person I was while on the meds.&nbsp; I would have to medicate with marijuana.&nbsp; Since my short time of the Road my medication had worked to perfection... the vendors knowledge and helpfulness is beyond anyone&#039;s expectations.... theemertriangle. meaniemart, bayareabuds, happysmoke420 You have all been amazing... hope this get this.... And to newbies.... GREAT VENDORS!!! I know there are many more but these are the guys I have dealt with and they are all stand up people with the way they handle business..<br /><br />and DPR.... You are the man... You&#039;re customer service not only from you and your staff but also the vendors is next to none and that&#039;s real.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THANK YOU.&nbsp;
