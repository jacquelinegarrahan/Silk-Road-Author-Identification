				My guy is pretty reputable. Top 1%. It&#039;s also a pretty large order, but I expect it by this thursday (which would be 14 days after being shipped). Fingers are double crossed&nbsp; ;D

				Ive had letters arrive after well over a month. The postal system in the US alone handles million of letters per day. Be patient. What you will learn to do is try and always have a head stash of w.e or place small domestic orders while you wait for the heavy orders.

Going on 25 for a local order myself. Still not sure if the shit has even been SHIPPED yet. Vendor claims there have been internal problems with his US syndicate ripping him off, but I think they&#039;re just shitty at what they do. <br />Hilariously enough, my OS FE order came yesterday, and was placed WELL after the local escrow order. They say never FE, I say fuck that. Do business with people who take it seriously, and you&#039;ll be fine.
