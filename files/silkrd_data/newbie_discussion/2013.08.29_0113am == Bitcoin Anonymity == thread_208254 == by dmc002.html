				I posted this over in security but I thought the newbies could use the info as well.<br /><br />Found this online. Some people seem to not care about anonymity. If you value your privacy please do not deposit your bitcoins directly in to Silk Road. That&#039;s just bad practice.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Average bitcoin users appear to be unaware at how quickly their bitcoin spending could be linked back to them. The Silk Road, an online marketplace of mostly illicit goods, only accepts bitcoin.<br /><br />&quot;We saw a lot of people deposit into Silk Road directly from their Mt. Gox address,&quot; Meiklejohn said. In those cases, law enforcement would have minimal work to obtain the name of a user if they presented a legal order to Mt. Gox.<br /><br />Money laundering is not impossible, but it is not particularly attractive with bitcoin. &quot;It seems like an offshore account at this point would be a lot easier,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Still, as long as bitcoin users are willing to take certain cumbersome steps, such as generating new bitcoin addresses for every transaction, staying off the exchanges and using other evasion techniques such as repeatedly forwarding funds, Bitcoin retains its privacy strengths.<br /><br />&quot;I do think inherently Bitcoin can provide you with a huge amount of anonymity, but the argument here is you have to work for it,&quot; Meiklejohn said. But most patterns of bitcoin use &quot;indicate most users are falling short.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Depends how you buy your BTC. There are ways to make your purchase of them totally anonymous, meaning there is no need to worry about where you send them.<br /><br />Example: use localbitcoins.com, only connect using Tor and use a fake email account to register. Select a seller who accepts cash deposits into his bank, and do that. Then send the BTC straight to SR from your&nbsp; localbitcoins wallet. Totally unconnectable to you.

				I think most people are pretty lax. If you take some precautions, you&#039;ll be the ones laughing if the shit ever hits the fan though.
