				Vendor: Emerald<br /><br />Product Reviewed : Ali Baba Hashish<br /><br />Delivery Time : 5 Days to the UK<br /><br />Stealth : Excellent<br /><br />Communication : 5/5 Answered all my newbie questions<br /><br />Quality : For the price you&#039;d be hard pressed to find any better<br />Good quality hash, equal to best i could find from most street vendors.<br /><br />!<br /><br />As opened up my triple vacuum parcel I knew that this was the future of the drug trade, gone would be the days of meeting a B.O. ridden drug dealer with a women&#039;s purse at the local KFC, That was then and this was now.<br /><br />I warmed the hash with my lighter, rolled a nice inside out joint and started to smoke.<br /><br />A nice mellow soothing aroma brings you back to a previous life when the world made sense, gone are your troubles, liberated are your emotions, the curtains have been drawn, take a bow son, finally a worthy audience.<br /><br />I thought about the future and the inevitable revolutions that would take place in the next 20 years,&nbsp; 3D- Printers, Holographic GUI&#039;s, Self Replicating Robots, The Technological Singularity was nearing and most of humanity seemed to be in the process of devolution.<br /><br />Was i crazy? Or was the world? Did that cat just give me a knowing smile? Was he a medium channeling the ether of a super evolved species across billions of light years away? So many Questions....So little time.....if only time was constant then at least i could set my watch to the ticking of the extra dimensional clock. <br /><br />BAM!!!! I am awakened!! 2 hours later I realized that I&#039;ve been staring at into a empty void whilst neither truly awake or truly asleep. Was a good smoke after all....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
