				I recently bought 10g of MDMA from a reputable seller on the road (I won&#039;t say who because I don&#039;t want to tarnish their reputation before contacting them.) Anyway, I sold an eighth to a friend who asked for his money back half an hour later because it didn&#039;t look right. He said it tasted salty and didn&#039;t trust it as it was very powdery and not rocky like my last batch (dutch trade) had been.<br /><br />So I was curious and anxious at this point to see what I&#039;d actually got, so I tasted it, and sure enough there was a distinct taste of molly, but also a salty taste which was unfamiliar. So I took a 100mg bomb about 90 minutes ago, and then snorted another 100mg about 20 minutes ago. I feel some effects of MDMA but not as strong as they should be for this amount. Its a lot more jittery/speedy than other stuff I&#039;ve had before. My heart rate is quite for Molly as well, usually goes back down after the inital rush. And my head is a lot less clear, I feel a bit dizzy. Also feel quite cold/hot not really in control of my own temperature.<br /><br />I&#039;d just be curious to know if anyone has any thoughts as to what this might be? I&#039;ve read about PMA being cut with Molly recently so if anyone has any experience of that could they tell me if it was anything similar to what I&#039;ve described? Hopefully, its just low purity molly though, I&#039;d to have 10g of a nasty drug like that on my hands.<br /><br />Oh I don&#039;t have any reagent kits available to me either, I would be happy to send a small sample to someone with access to a lab?<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp;

				Its a yellowy colour, when you grind it finely it all sticks together much more than molly does as well. I think I will, do they sell them on the road?

Also head shops in most major cities will have them.

				believe it or not, its probably cut with what you are tasting.. SALT!<br /><br />i remember not too long ago, a month maybe, a very reputable domestic vendor was selling MDMA for cheap bc he ordered from an overseas vendor and when he received it, noticed that it didn&#039;t look right. after researching he realized that it was mixed with salt to make it took like more. he said most the salt crystals were fairly large and that you could pick them out, not sure if that was the case or not with your batch. i don&#039;t remember off the top of my head who it was, otherwise i would send you in their direction, but i wouldn&#039;t be suprised if you got shammed the way he did. <br /><br />sorry buddy.

				Is it common on SR to get sub-grade product? Never had a batch of MDMA that was salty. Nearly all I have has reminded me of the smell of playdough! :D

				Don&#039;t be afraid to ask questions about sellers, just don&#039;t throw out accusations without some kind of proof.&nbsp;
