				are you asking what you can do individually? My recommendation would be NOT to tell your friends/party buds that you&#039;re using SR. Don&#039;t drop hints as to where your sources might be. Use a VPN when accessing and ALWAYS use PGP. Loose lips sink ships--

				Yeah, what is getting weird is that as SR becomes more popular people are asking me about it, and i have to play the dummy and be like &#039;oh yeah, heard about that site.....&#039;<br /><br />It feels weird when close friends ask who my source is-- i have to make up excuses, but i don&#039;t want to start making this a communal experience,

				What everyone can do is get more people to use SR. The more people that use it, the more anonymous it becomes. It makes it harder to track everyone.

				I disagree.. the most ppl that use SR the worse off it gets. I used to think that it was a good thing, but now become set with the idea that LESS attention THE BETTER!

				The gov&#039;t already knows about it and that is not going to go away. So there is no harm in having more people come on. What would be your reasoning for having less publicity making it safer?

				Not many realize that TOR was developed by the government to keep their shit secret, we are using their tech against them of course they know it exists but they cant do shit about it, also the more users on tor the more nodes / ips which makes it more secure.

				How bout this? The less publicity for sr the better but the more users of the board also better. Its kinda like jay walking if a ton of people are doing it how do you enforce it with that many people breaking the law??? The least likely you will be caught if you play it by the statistics.

				It&#039;s always about the media. If a major newspaper in some country writes a big article on SR, it will put pressure on government officials to stop it. Customs could get tougher.<br />But (at least in Europe) there are two things playing for us: <br />a) it&#039;s less dangerous top buy drugs online than on the streets, so the non-profit organizations are quietly supporting it and public as well<br />b) it&#039;s not creating as much crime as normal distribution scheme - a dealer&#039;s gotta be protected and have guys working for him. Vendors on Sr are more like businessmen, they dont need (much) guns<br />and try to work with as few people as possible to cut costs.

				I have an idea, how about DPR develop a test page and a SR study guide and people would have to read the guide which details how to keep SR safe and out of the limelight while also covering other issues such as scams and encryption, then people would have to pass this online test in able to sign up.

But vendors would probably be against it, they want as many customers as possible. Plus, passing the test doesnt mean anything. If you&#039;re stupid, a test won&#039;t help.<br />But it is certainly better than nothing.

				It would force them to read the guide to be able to pass the test, instead of people just blindly stumbling around not knowing their ass from a hole in the ground.

				As long as vendors and buyers play it safe they will not run into problems. A stupid buyer is not going to get a vendor caught, just himself. It is the stupid vendor that will get himself caught alone. So if people want to be stupid and not learn the process they will have to deal with the consequences and no one else.
