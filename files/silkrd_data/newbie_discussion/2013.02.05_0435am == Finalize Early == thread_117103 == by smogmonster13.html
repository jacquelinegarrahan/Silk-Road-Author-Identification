				Even though the buying guides clearly instruct us to not finalize early, there are several top rated vendors that demand finalize early. I respect the escrow process, so I have only ordered from vendors who do not ask for FE. <br /><br />Why are some vendors not honoring the escrow system, and is this a non-issue?

				I believe that most of the top vendors that require FE do so for buyers with either bad stats or no stats at all. They generally do this to protect themselves from scammers. I would recommend finding one that does not require FE, or trying out some of the digital downloads to boost your stats. PurpleLotus&#039;s Coupon Collections are good, and Shroomeister has a very nice collection of infographics.

				Yup, you can definitely just look elsewhere and find plenty of reputable vendors that don&#039;t require FE.<br /><br />Although sometimes it&#039;s worth the risk especially if they&#039;re a top-rated vendor with 99%+ feedback.

				Thanks, for the advice. I found Underground Syndicate, Hypnotiquestatz and Off the Wagon to be highly rated, don&#039;t require FE, and have delivered product to me super fast and stealthy. The only thing is, I haven&#039;t had a chance to assess the quality of the product. <br /><br />What is the best way to provide feedback, if everything else is good, but the quality isn&#039;t. Quality is very important (especially purity), and there doesn&#039;t seem to be an obvious way to provide good feedback.

				They do that because ....once customers receive the product...they never finalize....or they play that game of &quot;dude I never got my package&quot;......lots of scammers.......I my mind if you have a tracking number....you gonna receive your package....have used usps over 500 times never had a package lost....have had some get re-routed and it took like 10-14 days to get where they were going...but never had one lost......now if the customer gives bad information...bad address....bad name &quot;joe schmo&quot; bill clinton, stupid crap....ya shit could happen.....<br /><br />venders just want to make sure they get paid....end of story......the choice is yours.

				I will never FE early with any seller.&nbsp; Does no one remember the seller that used to be apart of SR?&nbsp; I forgot his name but he was a legend. <br /><br />He started from nothing and worked his way up the ranks as one of the top rated vendors.&nbsp; Eventually his order volume became so large that he started asking for FE so he could have the funds to produce those orders.&nbsp; This goes on great, so many people on the SR forums supporting him and justifying his new FE policy.&nbsp; He is fulfilling his FE orders as promised and no one is getting screwed over.&nbsp; Everyone is happy and his business grows even more.&nbsp; <br /><br />One day however he completely disappears, his volume of product gets so massive with enough FE purchases that he disappears with approximately $120,000 of BTC at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of his defenders say he will come back.&nbsp; But the man was a scam artist doing a long con on the SR forums, and he did damn good. <br /><br />This story is why I will never FE even if the seller is legendary.

				There&#039;s risk we can control, like escrow. It&#039;s there for a reason. If we all refused to FE, there would be no one demanding it. <br /><br />Sorry if that sounded a little, &quot;you may say I&#039;m a dreamer, but I&#039;m not the only one.&quot; : )

				My advice: Don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />Escrow system is there for a reason. It&#039;s to keep vendors from screwing us. It works. It&#039;s not perfect and it can be abused by someone malicious enough, but more often than not, those who do are blacklisted by both buyers and vendors alike. <br /><br />Do your research and buy from vendors who are newb-friendly or just outright awesome and don&#039;t ask for the early finalization. Everyone (usually) wins!

				blojan: Honestly, you can never tell. That&#039;s why word of mouth (the forums) is your best bet for finding out if a vendor is sketchy or not. Close to a year ago, the #1 vendor on SR pulled off the biggest scam of this site&#039;s history, and if memory serves me right, he had close to 100% customer satisfaction. Just do your homework and ask if you&#039;re not sure, you&#039;ll figure out how this works.
