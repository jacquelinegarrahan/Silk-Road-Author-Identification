They are just finishing the fifth week of a ten week flowering cycle.&nbsp; Links to the steamy pics are below.&nbsp; The pics are on a Tor image hosting site. Tor file hosting sites can flaky and unreliable at times, so if a link doesn&#039;t work you might try again in a little while.&nbsp; But if a link seems to be seriously broken, please PM me so I can re-upload them if necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll post a pic and some info with each posting.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a little challenging taking good pics under HPS lights; the raw pics have an strong yellow cast that isn&#039;t the most flattering lighting for people or plants.&nbsp; I did my best to color correct the pics in post-production with mixed success.&nbsp; If you see anytrhing you like, watch for my listings on SR in mid April.<br /><br />JackBlue<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/15f394e321

				Chernobyl is a variant of Trainwreck by breeder TGA Subcool.&nbsp; &nbsp;It has the same intoxicating smell, and long, airy runs of buds.&nbsp; Incredible resin production at this early stage of flowing.&nbsp; The buds stick to your hand if you brush up against them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect a huge yield from this strain, but it should be some really fine bud.<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=wp9.jpg<br /><br />Stay tuned.&nbsp; &nbsp;More bud porn to come.<br /><br />JackBlue<br />

				Fire OG Kush: Looking great so far!&nbsp; Very sticky, great structure and filling in really well.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they keep fattening up like this over the rest of the cycle I&#039;m going to have my work cut out form me tying them up so the branches don&#039;t break under the weight of the buds.<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=wrn.jpg

				Girl Scout Cookies:&nbsp; They are a little slower in early flowering than the other strains; I&#039;m hoping that they come on strong in the second half of the flowering cycle.&nbsp; At this stage the buds haven&#039;t filled in along the branches but you can get a feeling for the structure and great color of the buds.&nbsp; The buds have a high calyx to leaf ratio (should make them really easy to manicure) and are already sticky as hell.&nbsp; Hopefully the buds will fill in nicely over the next few weeks to give a good yield.&nbsp; My first grow with GSC, so I&#039;m not sure what to expect.<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=wpj.jpg

				Right now I&#039;m between crops (I only sell what I grow personally and always sell out before the next crop is ready).&nbsp; When this next crop is ready in early April I&#039;ll be selling 1/4, 1/2 and 1 ounce of each of these strains. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t settled on prices yet since it&#039;s still a while to go before it&#039;s ready.&nbsp; But I want to say something about my philosophy on prices and this business.&nbsp; I try to charge what I feel are honest, reasonable prices.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t usually have the opportunity to smoke other SR vendors week, I can&#039;t really compare the quality of my buds to others on SR.&nbsp; But I have been told over and over again by my customers that I could be charging a lot more based on the quality of my buds.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not why I&#039;m in this business.&nbsp; I enjoy growing the best buds that I can; getting rich off the weed market is not my goal and&nbsp; never has been.&nbsp; You may think this is just a bunch of vendor BS, but it&#039;s truly how I feel about it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a major grower.&nbsp; More of a boutique, specialty operation for people who appreciate what I&#039;m trying to do.&nbsp; If I can make some customers happy and pay my bills and live in one of the most beautiful places in the world free from the corporate rat race, there isn&#039;t a whole lot more I need.<br /><br />More pics will be going up tonight so stay tuned.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!!<br /><br />These two pics of Girl Scout Cookies were taken only six days after the first photo in this post.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost unrecognizable as the same plant.&nbsp; Talk about sticky!&nbsp; What was that girl scout pledge?&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t something like helpful strong courteous, resinous as hell..?&nbsp; Something like that anyways.
