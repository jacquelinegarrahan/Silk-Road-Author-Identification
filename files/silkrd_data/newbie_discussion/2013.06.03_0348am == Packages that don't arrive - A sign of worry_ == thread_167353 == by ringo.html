				If a package doesn&#039;t arrive, is this a cause of worry. My buddy ordered from a vendor and his package has not arrived after two weeks. I know some packages eventually come through, but let&#039;s say the package never arrives and ends up in the &quot;Dead Letter&quot; office of the USPS. What happens? Is the address flagged or does the letter get shredded? Anyone? He is getting paranoid, and I am new to SR. I want to make a purchase, but he is scaring the shit out of me.

				I am sitting with him right now ... here is a verbatim response (he does not want to log on):<br /><br />&quot;Under a gram - domestic. Never had a package missing before.&quot;<br /><br />Hope that helps wraithe.

				it would depend on the vendor if hes known to slack off but 2 weeks is bordering yea wtf. but majority of packages dont get lost.&nbsp; either they are not sent, the buyer is lying, or there was an error with the address and was returned.<br /><br />i wouldnt be scared.&nbsp; 1gram is usually personal depending and I dont see it being more then confiscation if theere was an issue.&nbsp; <br /><br />talk to the vendor find out when he really shipped it, did it have tracking etc then take it to resolution

				Alright, so my buddy gave me permission to post this:<br /><br />&quot;The package was under a g ... it was shipped with &#039;insufficient postage&#039; from the start. It still hasn&#039;t arrived. [He] believes it is sitting somewhere with [his] name and address on it. [He] is worried about future shipments and GPS trackers.&quot;<br /><br />Hope this helps. I really want to make a purchase, but it seems like this entire community/operation is compromised. It sucks being a newbie and getting in at the &quot;end&quot; of it.

				if the postage was short I have an idea who the vendor is.&nbsp; item is likely in the post office waiting for you.&nbsp; could be or not be sent back to sender. not sure how that works.

				If you have a good idea, then that is sufficient. I posted another thread concerning this vendor already ... but I am glad you realize whom my buddy is speaking of. He feels as though his journey on SR over, and he is unwilling to make purchases. I know that I would probably be safe with a new address, but it seems as though vendors fuck up every once in awhile. It&#039;s scary! I don&#039;t think this place is safe at all ... I am not convinced by any means. I know that TOR is protecting me at the moment, but it is weak (as a computer nerd, that is my opinion).<br /><br />How should I proceed? I am seeking guidance. My buddy is just trying to stay off LEO radar with any future packages. I know my buddy is in a location that is vulnerable to other roommates signing off on packages with ZERO KNOWLEDGE of what is inside the package.<br /><br />Is there a distinct mark or symbol that will give away a tracking device? For his benefit and mine! I am a semi-attorney in my opinion, and I don&#039;t think PC exists with mail without other circumstantial evidence (at the least). Maybe I am wrong, but this seems like a &quot;trap the roommate for permission&quot; situation. Although a judge may disagree, it all seems like &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;

				I had something similar happen. A vendor messed up somehow and my package(of WAY more than a GRAM!!&nbsp; ;) ) was sent back to the return address. Shit freaked me the fuck out! I switched addresses for a while but then had problems with that drop so I was forced back to the address I was sure was burned. I used it a few times with absolutely no problems. I think your friend will be just fine. But if at all possible find a new drop just to be safe.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=167353.msg1193076#msg1193076">Quote from: ringo on June 03, 2013, 04:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hope this helps.

Even if the package really got returned back you have not the address flagged for less than 1g. You are perfectly fine. They will just confiscate the drug and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />But if you are really paranoid about it (really you shouldn&#039;t) just change drop for a while or buy many legit things from amazon or similar to your address for some time, then begin again.

				Thanks to those who have replied to this post (including wraithe, who flamed me in another post ... come on man, I am not your enemy here). I told my buddy exactly what you guys have been saying ... stop orders, let the address cool off, or just fucking move. His real worry was using a real name when I got to the bottom of our conversation. I think that was the kicker ... he can always change addresses, but his name is connected to an order gone missing. So, I have got him a little more calm, but on his behalf ... I am paranoid as shit about people engaging in this stuff. I guess I am just a worrier, but nothing seems right about this situation. Thanks for the input.

				Be advised the Postal Service Blows! Even priority mail I&#039;ve noticed is now taking more than 3 days almost half the time I use it. I have waited in some cases ,9 10,11,12 days to receive pakages due to errors made by the postal service. <br /><br />The postal service has been cut to the bear bone and its really starting to show in the delivery times. It makes me fuckin crazy and ya know what its only gonna get worse. <br /><br />They are talking about adding yet another day to all priority and first class mail and packages to save more money in the future. Wonderful thing isn&#039;t it?

				it doesn&#039;t seem like a vendor with experience would apply the wrong postage.&nbsp; if that is truly the case, i think you would simply get a postage due notice.&nbsp; the USPS actually works pretty good, and safe, as long as the users don&#039;t muck something up.&nbsp; my personal opinion as to why a pak might not arrive is that the buyer has generated an error in the encrypted mailing address.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve had this happen before - vendor shipped... item didn&#039;t arrive after 10 days. Vendor reshipped a larger quantity to make up for it... that didn&#039;t arrive. I took the refund. A few days later, a package shows up with mystery drug in it - I check the guy&#039;s reviews and see that someone else received the second package&nbsp; &gt;:( I have no idea how it happened, but it was definitely major vendor screwup and I continued to use the address without issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently waiting on a package that&#039;s been over 10 days - but 2 other orders have arrived in the meantime.<br /><br />So it&#039;s probably fine, but to be completely safe, you could switch drops. I think it&#039;s addresses that get flagged, not names.
