				god no...I go from hyper and wired, to WISHING I could sleep.&nbsp; I dont do coke much anymore cause it takes me sooo long to comedown and I can&#039;t sleep without benzos and just prefer an opiate I used to do coke often and liked it but not anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you were sleeping it was not good at all

				jack...<br /><br />lol thats why I dont like coke much.&nbsp; a tiny bit can be nice but if its crappy cut w meth or I have too much I get that same feeling.&nbsp; I can even tell myself I am being irrational yet I still think the nieghbors car door shutting must be a cop even though I know it is not and I had to look out window.&nbsp; Enough reason to stay away from coke!<br /><br />The lavalita or &quot;lavada&quot; coke is a different story...pure euphoria but I havent seen that stuff since i would get lots of coke and it was the stuff the dealers did and sold the normal shit...mmmm lavada
