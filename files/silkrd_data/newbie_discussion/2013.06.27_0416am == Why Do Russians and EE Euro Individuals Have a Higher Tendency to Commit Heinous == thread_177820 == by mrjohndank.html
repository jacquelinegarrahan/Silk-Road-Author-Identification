				Crimes. Like that one guy from Russian butchering kids for snuff films, or that 3 guys one hammer guy, or other atrocities. Why do they tend to have rather dark sides. Not trying to be racist, just seems like a lot of dark things come out of that area. Communism as well.

				^ what he said. No easy access to guns equals gruesome kills with other, not so humane weapons. Although really a gun death is no walk in the park, you are pretty much being stabbed by a bullet.

				Also, confirmation bias might play a role in your belief. You only tend to hear those kinds of stories from these countries. So, it creates a fallacy that they may be more gruesome when similar shit happens almost everywhere else too<br /><br />just my 2c

				I imagine that is true. There are some gruesome murders here too in the States, but I am surprised anyone could kill children like that guy did. Also, it seems like Bulgaria has a lot of missing young women. The only other place that could compete with Bulgaria would be Colombia (via Interpol). I guess what I mean by gruesome is sex trafficking (not that it couldn&#039;t happen here), snuff, severe abuse of children, and just cruel deaths. I am not trying to paint a bad picture of Russians, but it has always seemed dark (even read some literature from there).
