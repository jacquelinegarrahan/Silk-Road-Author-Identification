				You have to have 50 posts in this Newbie Discussion section before you can post in any other section. It&#039;s a new rule in case you have an old account and are just now noticing this.

				I wish I would have known this 3 hours ago. I am so fucking frustrated right now. I couldn&#039;t figure out why I couldn&#039;t post. Especially since I have posted in the other boards before. God damn.<br /><br />Alright, 50 posts here, this is number 2.<br />I was trying to get help with PGP so I could get an order in (my first one) tonight otherwise I need to wait until next week for the vendor to ship. It doesn&#039;t look like the newbie PGP thread is that active but I will go there. I&#039;ve been working on this for the last 5 hours and it is so fucking frustrating.
