				When you receive your drug from a vendor, do you actually try it before writing a review?&nbsp; It seems like you&#039;d want to make sure it&#039;s good first, but it&#039;s not always convenient to take a drug whenever happens to arrive, especially something long-lasting like acid.

				You can do the review in stages.&nbsp; When you first get it, finalize and make your comments about shipping, stealth, and communications.&nbsp; Later, when you try the product, go back and edit the review to add in more info.

				Haha, awesome!&nbsp; Psychedelics are my favorite and I kind of hate looking at a computer screen while I&#039;m on them, but whatever works for you!&nbsp; Sounds like your night is more fun than mine.

				Actually strangelights, you&#039;re dead right. Wasn&#039;t psychedelics per se but MD*. I&#039;d dread the thought of a computer screen on anything else :)

				If you can (hard with acid) its in your best interest to sample first before finalizing because I got sold some Bunk Crack that was completely fake and totally unusable, Im soooo glad I tried it before finalizing that order!!!

				I finalise soon after I receive it. So it kind of depends what it is, or whether it&#039;s the weekend :).

				I feel like the review section is more for a quick &quot;Yeah I recieved it, they&#039;re not gonna rip you off&quot; review while the forum is more for extended discussion about shipping, product, etc etc. Although I didn&#039;t realise that you could edit your review, so perhaps I&#039;ve been doing it wrong.

				auto11858418, I think between the stats and the forums, there&#039;s plenty of information to make fairly well informed decisions. If a guy has 300 transactions with 99% feedback shipping worldwide, AND the forum posts are all quite positive, you can be fairly sure, dependent on your on LE of course, that you&#039;ve got a trusted guy. So far, that&#039;s been my experience. Not one let-down. Perhaps I&#039;m lucky, but a bit of research does go a long way.

				I usually comment before trying for weed since it&#039;s probably almost impossible to make &quot;fake&quot; weed that looks and smells real.&nbsp; Other drugs especially any powder or crystal based things should certainly be rated and commented after trying.

Unfortunately, some vendors don&#039;t have that forum presence or reviews, yet have really positive stats. It&#039;s a bit of a risk ordering from them, but I&#039;ve been pretty lucky so far to not have any of my money scammed.

				True, it also depends on the drug.&nbsp; I feel like for small amounts of weed you&#039;re not going to run into too many scammers, it&#039;s not worth it.&nbsp; However more heavier drugs like heroin or oxies it seems like the client base might be more easily duped into scams.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought weed and mushrooms and have never had a problem.&nbsp; I still think you should try the drugs before reviewing, that&#039;s the whole point and it allows future buyers to know that what they are buying is legit.

				I&#039;m gonna agree with excellenttoast. You should wait until you take it to review it, even if you just need to send a message to the vendor to say &quot;I&#039;m waiting until I take it to review it&quot;.<br /><br />But in the end, something is better than nothing so if you review it in full on the forums I think that&#039;s fine. People should know to rely on both stats and forum reviews.
