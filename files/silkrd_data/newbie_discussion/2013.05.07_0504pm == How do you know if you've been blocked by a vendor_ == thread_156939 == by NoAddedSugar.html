				I dont think a vendor can block you, at least not in the way you are referring.&nbsp; Maybe they have been having trouble getting onto the site of if they are a large vendor, maybe they are just back logged with orders. Up to you if you want to cancel, but 7 days is a long wait. <br />

Vendors were given 7 days to process orders due to the recent DDoS attack but this has now been brought back down to 4. I agree with Toska though, 7 days is a relatively long time to be waiting for an order to process.<br /><br />Libertas

				It seems even longer with no word from TopNotch, and nothing on his page. It&#039;s so frustrating not knowing. I don&#039;t feel I should cancel though. I don&#039;t want to seem fickle and jeopardize any further dealings with him.
