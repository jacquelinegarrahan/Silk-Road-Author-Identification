				High folks,this may be posted in the wrong section,sorry if so<br />As the Subject says,i first started buying @£1=11 BTC-now its steadily risen to £1=16BTC,there`s no need to explain the implications on item cost because of this and has any buyers noticed vendors reducing product prices ,proportionally to the increase,i personally haven`t!<br />Please leave any info on the subject-as i`m really not prepared to pay a price one day and the next nearly 50% more...............<br />Cheers and be lucky........................................B

				I have watched the price of btc more than double in the past three months. When I first started with SR checking things out and studying things the price was 13 usd now they are 26 $. For the answer on vendors changing prices most are not on a daily basis, but the really good ones are keeping up. Those are the one I keep up with..

				Thanks for the reply man,i was beginning to think that users were all drug addled to the extent that their pockets were so deep it didn`t matter-so with your vendors they adjust on a weekly...ish basis?<br />Its a shame a software could be written that rises drops directely proportionally with BTC trading-of course i understand why SR is so very popular,but on a 50|% increase on a sale from one day to next,its understandable why the prices aren`t changed accordingly.<br />Just a thought,but if there was a drop in BTC value,do you think the vendors would be as slow/remiss in changing/upping their prices? .......it is a sellers market eh?<br />Thanks again man..................................B

				most vendors have their prices set on a dollar amount, so the BTC price automatically adjusts with the inflation while the dollar amount stays the same.
