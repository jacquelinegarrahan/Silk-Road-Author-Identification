				Does anyone know how SR places a dollar value on it&#039;s bitcoins?&nbsp; It definitely isn&#039;t linked to Mt. Gox in real time.&nbsp; There is definitely a delay but does anyone know the true methodology?

				With the way Bitcoins have been going up I would wait before buying more.&nbsp; It was less than a month ago where one Bitcoin equaled $30 and as of yesterday one Bitcoin equaled $80.&nbsp; It is such a new thing that kinks will have to be worked out I&#039;m sure.&nbsp;

				Bitcoin demand is increasing due to the EU instability in Cyprus. Many Russians have their money stashed in banks in Cyprus, with the talk of taxing deposits to support the insolvent banks people are pulling their liquid assets and buying bitcoins.<br /><br />Several other countries with sketchy monetary situations are making decentralized currency look very appealing. I don&#039;t see the value dropping until European instability resolves. Most likely to go to $75 by the end of the week and stabilize there for a few weeks. Then when the next crisis comes along it will spike to $100. No telling where it will end.<br /><br />I am just happy that SR has some mechanism for trying to follow the dollar. With rapid changes in price it may spook vendors even with hedging.
