				Thought Id document my first purchase beginning to end as this might help new buyers after me especially ones looking to purchase id. I think we should all document purchases and experinces with vendors of coin and vendors on here as well<br /><br />So far I purchased my coin from a user on localbitcoins. My experience with the seller and site were good. Had zero problems. Ive since transferred all the coin to my SR account.<br /><br />Ordered an Illinois ID through vendor leOracle. Its been about 24hrs no update. Ill keep the curious informed.

				I&#039;ve noticed SR if not doesn&#039;t allow, definitely doesn&#039;t seem to promote its id/forgeries/info dumps very much.&nbsp; There are other, better markets available for such things imo.
