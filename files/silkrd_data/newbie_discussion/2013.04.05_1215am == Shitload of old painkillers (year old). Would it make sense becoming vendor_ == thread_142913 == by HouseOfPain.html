				So, lets say I had a shit load of old painkillers. Vicodin, Percocet, Dilaudis, Roxies, even some Fent. BUT, they&#039;re not new. I&#039;m guessing between 1-1.5 years old. Are they safe to take?<br />I&#039;ve done some here and there and the buzz has been on par with normal. Would it make sense to create a vendor account just for these and firesale them at a cheap price? Or do people prefer only &quot;phramacy fresh&quot;? Or if I put a disclaimer on the vendor page saying these are not new... but I&#039;m selling them for half price or whatever. Dunno the health ramifications/interest level to be honest.<br />Anyone?

				Morphinans have a tendency to be exceptionally stable to prolonged storage. the dihydroderiviates are somewhat a little less stable than their saturated ccounterparts but they are stable, too.<br />Pharmaceutical manufacturers salt their (freebase-)products to make them more stable. (with morphinans its tartrat salts, mostly, but hydrochlorides and sulfates are being produced, too)<br />And then, they integrate them into the matrix under nitrogen atmosphere to avoid oxidation. <br />What I am saying is, that the manufacturers do everything they can to make them stable as long as possible. <br />The &quot;best before&quot; (or whats it called in english) is just the suggested time to reconfirm the ingredients are still intact according to the pharmacopoeia. Seller would need to test, which is more expensive than throw away and get new.<br />It is save to assume that your products are save to sell even in five to ten years.<br /><br />I have got 1g bottles of original german dilaudid, dicodid and some other rare opioids from the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s, if I had an interest in taking them, I might consider recrystallizing them because of the eventual spores that went into them when they were produced but I dont doubt the purity of the product due to potency decline.<br />After all : trust your chemist :)

				I&#039;m sure you could create a vendor profile, but like you said you&#039;d probably have to sell them cheap because you won&#039;t be able to build a reputation.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;d get Ron Paul&#039;s Anhydrides for fun/profit and turn it into super morphine or heroin or whatever.&nbsp; But I&#039;m just getting into chemistry, and that would take quite a bit of time I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link in case you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0f18d9fad1
