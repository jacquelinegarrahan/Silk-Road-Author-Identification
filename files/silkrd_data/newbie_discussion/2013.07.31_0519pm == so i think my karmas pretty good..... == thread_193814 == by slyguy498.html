				Go to the &quot;Spare Btcs thread&quot; in &#039;off topic&#039; ... you could have some luck there, but DO the right thing if you do get a loan, and return it ... that will set you up to do it again if need be ;o)<br /><br /><br />m m m

				you get to be able to &quot;give and take karma&quot; to another member, when you reach 100 posts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Making posts that are informative or helpful will get the clicks of a few people ... there are also &#039;karma whoring threads&#039; where members go around boosting each others +karma ... but it&#039;s a scam, coz ... it just is!&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s how some &#039;pretty random&#039;&nbsp; people have +karma of over 500, sure there are a few members who have rightly deserved this, (i.e. Pine, a truly wonderful member, runs the PGP club here) but it will show in the amount of posts they&#039;ve made ... Or, maybe If they&#039;&#039;re DPR!&nbsp; lol!<br /><br /><br />Karma doesn&#039;t really mean much except you&#039;ve said stuff that resonated with people, and as you can see with myself for instance, also &#039;rattling some cages&#039; as well, when the bullshit starts to fly!&nbsp; IMO people with about 50/50 good/bad karma are probably the &#039;most honest&#039; with their opinions, as someone with something solid to say, will definitely get a response.<br /><br />So,&nbsp; Go forth and post sensibly, and help others in your travels, and you will be well&nbsp; karma&#039;d ... and dont worry if you get 5-10 neg K points one day, there are some sad souls floating about, with multiple accounts, who sometimes go on a mission to get somwone lots of bad karma!<br /><br />&nbsp; At least there&#039;s a rule where you can only give any one person, a karma point, up or down, once every 72 hours! A very good idea, as it stops pissed off people, and people &quot;on drugs&quot; from doing stupid stuff with the karma, and THEN it WOULD BE pretty useless ... once you read around the forums a bit, you&#039;ll start to see the&nbsp; patterns!<br /><br /><br />Take care out there, and do your research on the vendors etc HERE on the forum, and you&#039;ll come out on top<br /><br />m m m
