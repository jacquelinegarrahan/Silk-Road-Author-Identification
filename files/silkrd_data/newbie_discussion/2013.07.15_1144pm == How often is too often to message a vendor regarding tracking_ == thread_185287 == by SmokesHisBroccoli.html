				I placed a domestic order via priority mail that hasn&#039;t shown up in 5 days after being market in transit.&nbsp; I&#039;m starting to get a little nervous.&nbsp; The vendor&#039;s profile states to not message before 3 days after ordering for shipping info.&nbsp; They do not state whether or not they will release DCN in their profile.&nbsp; When I messaged him today asking for either DCN or just track it for me and let me know where it&#039;s at I got no response. <br /><br />I feel like messaging him again but I&#039;m trying to be professional.&nbsp; I was very diplomatic and polite in asking for the information before.&nbsp; Should I message one more time today?&nbsp; All I want is peace of mind and this vendor isn&#039;t helping me out with that.&nbsp; Very frustrating to say the least.&nbsp; It&#039;s one thing for USPS to be dragging ass but to have a vendor not provide information just leaves me assuming the worst.&nbsp;

				Personally, I would wait a full 24 hours after sending the first message but that&#039;s just me. USPS has been erratic lately. Some things I get lightening fast, others take up to a week.

				Answering messages is a full time job for most vendors, and since it hasn&#039;t been an inordinate amount of shipping time yet, it probably isn&#039;t their priority. Give it a day or two, if it&#039;s a good vendor you&#039;ll hear back from them by then.

The resolve button is set to appear this Thursday night.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read on other threads that you should wait until a day or two before auto finalize to hit the resolve button.&nbsp; Should I try sending yet another message to him?&nbsp; Should I hit resolve right away if I haven&#039;t heard back by Thursday?&nbsp; Does he have to provide shipping information during resolution to prove the package was shipped?&nbsp; <br />

				I know it&#039;s nerve-wracking waiting on an order to arrive, but also remember that just because a package has been marked &quot;in transit&quot; does not mean that it was actually mailed that day.&nbsp; In fact, I know that some vendors print their labels one day and mail it on another.&nbsp; <br /><br />In regards to your other questions, I would say what you do from here on out depends on several things.&nbsp; To start with, is this your first order with this vendor?&nbsp; Secondly, what kind of feedback does he/she have?&nbsp; Thirdly, has the vendor been online and read your messages since you sent them?&nbsp; The answers to the above and whether or not you receive your order and or hear back from your vendor in the next couple of days will significantly impact the decision to go to resolution right away or not.<br /><br />Hope this helps a little bit.&nbsp; Keep us posted on the outcome.

				It is nerve wracking waiting on the package that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; But what is really getting to me is my vendor seems to be too busy to answer my messages.&nbsp; The only communication I received from the vendor is when I asked on Friday if the package was in fact sent out.&nbsp; They informed me that even though it was marked in transit Monday it was sent the following day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes this is my first order with this vendor.&nbsp; They have almost flawless feedback.&nbsp; Almost 100% positive on well over 1,000 transactions.&nbsp; Huge fan base too.&nbsp; Everything looks legit.&nbsp; And yes the vendor has been online and read one of my messages.&nbsp; They read the one I sent yesterday and without going into detail I know for a fact they were online today after I sent my message today asking for shipping info even though that message was not read.&nbsp; One thing I did notice was over the past few weeks they have had a couple people not receive their packages but they took care of them enough to where the people left 5/5 feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just sent another message now just because I feel my messages got over looked this vendor does a good volume.&nbsp; Will keep you posted.&nbsp; <br />

				Maybe i can be of some assistance&nbsp; 8)...I read messages all the time and don&#039;t respond. Some i don&#039;t respond to because i consider it a dumb question and others I&#039;m actually checking into what the individual asking. Most of the time if you say i&#039;ll look into it, you get a message right back that says Yea thanks, I ordered last night and it doesn&#039;t take that long.... 5 days is a long time for priority but I&#039;ve seen express get missent to the wrong state or stuck at some hub for over a month. It should never be a problem when asking where your merch is. Given that it;s been within a respectable time and the end of that USPS workday.&nbsp;

				Hitting resolve always gets their attention. If they don&#039;t give tracking in reso, then try for a reship at first. With SR&#039;s new buyer stats, a refund looks worse than it is because it will show a 100% refund rate for the month. So you want to save that as a last resort. <br /><br />If they have tracking and it shows delivered, then you&#039;re SOL.

				Thanks for your help everyone.&nbsp; Today was the 7th day after being shipped and my priority package finally arrived&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I was so happy to see it I got an instant high just like getting my very first order!&nbsp; What a relief.&nbsp; It was very nerve wracking for me trying to stay patient and just when I was giving up hope the package showed up.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing is this is the first time I&#039;ve had to wait this long so my inexperience with waiting had me second guessing and thinking the worst.&nbsp; As I read through other people&#039;s experiences on this forum in the past few days I realized I was not alone.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve had it take this long I think if it happens again I&#039;ll be better prepared for it.&nbsp; Conditioned if you will.&nbsp; Like soulkontroller says, patience is very important and next time I&#039;ll be more patient.&nbsp; I probably messaged the vendor one too many times.&nbsp; I probably lost one too many hours of sleep over it.&nbsp; Next time I won&#039;t let that happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, I hope that I didn&#039;t burn a bridge with this vendor.&nbsp; In the end I was very happy with their product and stealth.&nbsp; They say that messaging them too soon after a package was shipped might get a future order canceled.&nbsp; At this point there&#039;s nothing I can do but hope they understand what I was going through.&nbsp; I was polite with my messages.&nbsp; I left a great feedback and mentioned nothing about the delay with shipping because it was 100% USPS fault so why even mention it.&nbsp; I never mentioned them by name on here either because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt and protecting their identity and that turned out to be the right thing to do because in the end they fulfilled their end of the business transaction.&nbsp; I&#039;m a stand up guy and this is a stand up vendor.&nbsp; So for all you out there dealing with this same thing do your best to have patience and whatever you do don&#039;t flame your vendor because there&#039;s a high probability it&#039;s the bums at USPS dropping the ball!&nbsp;
