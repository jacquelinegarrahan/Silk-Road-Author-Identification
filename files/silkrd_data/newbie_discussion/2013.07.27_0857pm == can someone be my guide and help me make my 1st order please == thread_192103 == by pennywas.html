				it is a good idea to read the buyers guide/SR wiki first&nbsp; ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page ) and to lurk a bit on the forums.<br />bitcoins are easiest to get at localbitcoins.com<br /><br />cheers

				yes def. read the buyers guide for sure, as well as read up on all type of security measures you can take to protect yourself, learn about browsing anonymously, learn about constantly changing methods to stay ahead of LE...learn about encryption methods and so forth&nbsp; ....you have to realize LE know about SR they know how it works ....the key is to be 5 steps ahead of them read all about shipping practices, stealth methods, the way to get coins from A to B ..with foggers and other programs that conceal the transfer to SR...you need to really go out of your way to make sure you protect yourself from all angles especially with sensitive information before you consider purchasing...as well as i go into indepth convos with the vendors from shipping to stealth to the storing of sensitive info you need to have all your basis covered....i did research on SR for 6 months before i placed my first, and i still study up everyday on safety , security , and how to stay ahead of the game.....if not my friend you can end up behind bars.... SR is a beautiful thing ....if you know how to properly use it and how to keep yourself safe the moment you get complacent is the moment you end up in the PEN....goodluck my friend i hope you learn alot and safeguard yourself before you decide to purchase.&nbsp;

				To help out newbs, I wrote up some methods for buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road. <br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				Getting BTC will likely be your hardest step.&nbsp; Also, make sure you know how to encrypt your info.&nbsp; I personally encrypt my info using a simple gedit plugin for Ubuntu.&nbsp;

				Flip them a few times first. Like a free wallet at&nbsp; https://blockchain.info, especially if you are going to use a site like Coinbase, I am considering using CB first since I understand flipping and don&#039;t intend on ordering large amounts.

				Getting bitcoin is a pain in the ass I did lot&#039;s of research to find it then when I did most sites want a bunch of personal info which I am not to keen about.&nbsp; So I go through moneypaktrader for my bitcoin, it doesn&#039;t ask for no personal details onlly pitfall is the percent they take but worth it for being discreet.&nbsp; All you need to do is buy a moneypak card put in the info and you&#039;ll have your coin within 24 hours mine never took longer than 4 to deposit into my wallet..&nbsp; Goodluck!
