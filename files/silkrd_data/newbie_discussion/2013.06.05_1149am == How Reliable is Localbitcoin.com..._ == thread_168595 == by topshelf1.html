				I&#039;ve set up an anonymous account...using the tor browser of course...and a tor email address as my contact...<br /><br />I made contact with a local seller who I can meet in person and do the transaction from his smartphone/laptop to mine...using wifi in a local place...<br /><br />I give him the money when the bitcoin shows up in my wallet on my laptop...<br /><br />Does this make sense...?<br /><br />Are there any gotchas...?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t use a TOR address since that is a pretty big &#039;red flag&#039; to the seller that you are probably buying the bitcoins to purchase stuff through TOR/SR/etc..

				The website itself is trustworthy.&nbsp; The people....well...just don&#039;t agree to meet anybody in a dark alley with handfuls of sweaty cash.

				I would not worry about the tor address...I am in a country that pays little to no attention to tor or bitcoin...<br /><br />I do have a localbitcoin.com account that is set up in a regular browser...I could use this to deposit the bitcoin into...however...this leaves an IP adddress and a clue to my physical location...<br /><br />My main worry is that the seller will be able to somehow scam me...by supposedly transferring the bitcoin in my wallet...and then poof they&#039;re gone...<br /><br /><br />Is this possible...?...once I see the bitcoin in my wallet (whether the wallet is in my tor browser or ay other kind of browser)...it should be there safely at that point...no?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...

				That&#039;s ridiculous, banks need better things to do. One example would be not failing and asking for bailouts.
