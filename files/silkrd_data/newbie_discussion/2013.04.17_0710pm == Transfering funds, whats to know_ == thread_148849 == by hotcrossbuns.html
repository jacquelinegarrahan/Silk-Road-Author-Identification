				&nbsp;So I have found a good BTC supplier on localbitcoins.com <br />they do Escrow which is awesome.. <br /><br />So I know that this supplier is on the SR also, is it safe to send straight to my SR wallet?<br /><br />Also, mtgox, love it or hate it, will get much better rates than localbitcoins... is there anyway to get funds off MT safely, I don&#039;t understand what Tumbl means ?<br /><br />thanks x

				Gox is not recommended. Verification is a bitch, and it is about as unanon as you can get. Bitfloor or BTC-e would be better, although Bitfloor is only good if you live near a Bank of America.<br /><br />Really, there is no risk in you being discovered through BTC transfers. But I like to send my BTC to my personal wallet first, partly for obfuscation but also so that if a problem occurs I know whether it is something wrong with the Road or something wrong with the guy who sent me the coins.

				You shouldn&#039;t use the escrow system of localbitcoins since it requires your telephone number which isn&#039;t exactly anonymous.. Getting them without escrow isn&#039;t that risky. They withdraw the coins in front of you usually so.. You also shouldn&#039;t use MTGox, use bitfloor or BTC-e. <br />If you bought your coins anonymously (without localbitcoins escrow) and went to your online trading site on an anonymous account you shouldn&#039;t really need to tumble your coins.<br />If you live in the US though, just buy your coins with a cash deposit.. Much better price.
