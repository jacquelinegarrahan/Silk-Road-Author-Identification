				I think i read somewhere in the past that a new buyer could only get into escrow after they have previously made a few transactions. This can involve just purchasing a couple EBooks. I tried to search for it, no luck.<br /><br />Could someone just quickly explain to me how many previous transactions, if any, are needed for one to be able to get into escrow for their larger transactions?

				look ill tell you from experience dont fe unless you have a tracking number so you can verify a sent package..&nbsp; other than that its entirely upto your judgement if they have alot of positive feedback then maybe try. BE CAREFUL. new buyers are easy to scam. pleanty of legit vendors wont require fe even if youre new

				Listen, if the product you want is not rare and other vendors have it try to look for one that does not require FE for new users or you could just take a leap of faith and FE. <br />There is an old saying, do not gamble more than you can afford to lose.

				SR is all a gamble, domestic not so much. but FE is just a plain blind leap of faith if you have no prior dealings with the vendor

				If you have to do it because you&#039;re new then do it with a very trusted vendor. Otherwise tell them to fuck off. If you have more than 10 transactions and a decent amount of money spent then continue to tell them to fuck off

				The vendor has 99 feedback over about a 6 month period and hundreds of transactions. Obviously, very good feedback.<br /><br />I can pay an extra $35 to not have to FE early, the product cost is $200. Doesn&#039;t really seem worth it to me to pay the $35.<br /><br />Also as my original question introduced, all this goes into escrow, even with it being my first transaction?

				It goes into escrow and then you FE. That means you&#039;re no longer in escrow. That means you can get ripped off. 99 percent is pretty good but if you have the option just pay the extra 35
