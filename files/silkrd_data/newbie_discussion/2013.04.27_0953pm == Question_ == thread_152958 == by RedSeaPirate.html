				I encrypt my message and then include my private key under it in the address box.&nbsp; In my experience most vendors are pretty busy and that can cut down on the number of messages they have to deal with.

				I encrypt my address using the vendor&#039;s key. I never give them my key unless I need them to send me an encrypted message which is very rare.

I recommend looking up the PGP club if you haven&#039;t already, they&#039;re all about the ins and outs of encryption.

				Liston on SR is a scammer.&nbsp; I spent 1.5k with him and everything was well.&nbsp; Then he gained my trust and made a large purchase and he royally dicked me.&nbsp; It was supposed to come from the US, I don&#039;t do international because it is more dangerous.&nbsp; I even emailed him about it and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...

You already have your own thread stating this verbatim.<br /><br /><br />To The OP - I&#039;m sorry I just wanted to say that first. <br /><br />I do encrypt my address with the vendor&#039;s public key, but I never include mine. I don&#039;t PM it to them. That&#039;s not the protocol. You encrypt your address and paste it into the box where your supposed to type your address.<br /><br />If they need it to encrypt an email to me, which is extremely rare, I just paste it into a blank email an send it to them.
