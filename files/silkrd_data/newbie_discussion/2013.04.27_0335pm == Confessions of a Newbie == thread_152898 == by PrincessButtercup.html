				I&#039;ve been lurking around SR and the Forum for a awhile now and am quite amazed at the time some people put in to help the less clued in among us - good folks like &quot;White Out&quot;, &quot;Pine&quot; &quot;Vegeta&quot; and many more.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve learnt (and put in to practice) so far:<br /><br />1) Always always always use PGP encryption for vendor communications - no exceptions!&nbsp; <br />2) Never FE -- except of course some will insist on it from newbies and if you are dealing with a limited number of suppliers your may have no choice - but resist.<br />3) For those of us with compromised computers - machines that have been used to torrent, download any amount of porn, that kind of thing - it&#039;s best to use a Linux based boot software like TAILS or Liberte to access Tor. It&#039;s important to keep your Tor life and clearnet life completely separate.<br />6) Change your default wi-fi router password, your ISP will know the password for the router at your address if they provided it.<br />4) Consider using a different name on the Forum as SR - not everyone agrees this is important. Individual choice.<br />5) If you buy bitcoins using a bank transfer or any other method that links you to the transaction, move the coins to a service like Bitfog first, and then on to SR. Bitfog (or whatever is used) should only ever be accessed through Tor.<br />7) Use your real name and address for the delivery (no consensus on this at all) - I think this makes sense for small orders/ personal quantities. For anything larger a safe address should be sought (not sure how this is done as most of us would have a hard time finding a reliable address)<br />8) Keep your house CLEAN if that is where your small purchase is destined. <br />9) If LE get involved in any way say nothing - zip! Don&#039;t accept the assertion that you are in control or possession of anything that arrives in your mailbox - anyone can send anything anonymously to anyone.<br /><br /><br />So this is what I&#039;ve worked out so far - anyone have anything to add?<br /><br />

				That&#039;s a really good list. I love lists! Good info/advice for all new comers to the drugs in the mail game. 2 things. 1)For the pgp encryption you don&#039;t have to use it for EVERYTHING, just for sensitive info like your address or anything else you wouldn&#039;t want anyone else to know. A lot of vendors find it annoying to have to use their pgp to answer questions like, &quot;did you send it yet?&quot;. Although I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll all understand why you wanted to.

				Great list. Almost like an unofficial code of conduct. Thank you!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And the addition of eating ice cream - genius. Vanilla...now there is a spice that evolved over millions of years just for making ice cream great!

When I post here I remind myself that LE are among those reading and having an extra layer of anonymity between my two activities (buying and talking ... about buying :)) helps ease my slightly paranoid mind!<br /><br />As for delivery, you have no control over what comes to your mailbox (thus all the junk mail we live with) - true address, real name = clean hands (imo).<br /><br />

				I read all the advice threads and still didn&#039;t use PGP on my first orders. If the site wouldn&#039;t have gone down and got me all paranoid, I&#039;d probably still be doing it that way.&nbsp; Now that I took the twenty minutes (or so) it takes to figure out how to use it. It seems stupid not to.<br /><br />I have another confession...<br /><br />For a grown man, I spend way too much time daydreaming about how cool it would be to be in a bromance with some of the vendors here. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would add to this that you are much less likely to get a love letter from customs or the USPS if you stick to ordering domestic only.&nbsp; I understand this isn&#039;t always an option for a variety of reasons, but when you can, you should.&nbsp;

Now I know I am anonymous, but it feels better to have an extra layer of anonymity between my buying activities and my &#039;talking&#039; activities - it really does come down to personal preference.

For me, I remind myself whenever I&#039;m on the Forum that everything I contribute is being read by my fellow travellers and LE.
