				Just saying. . . We should start a waiting club for this shit. Something supposed to go out via priority on last Monday morning, still not here by Friday is just crazy! The last two orders I had with other vendors went out on a wednesday, one got to me friday and the other got to me on saturday. Indubitably said he got his shit together with shipping times a few weeks ago, I guess that is not the case! I got one thing to say : If you are selling Heroin, you had damn well better send it when you say you are going to send it. I&#039;m only doing Express from now on, priority is too unpredictable.

				Yeah. This dude is fucking up big time. He won&#039;t answer his messages. He marks the orders in transit, but he hasn&#039;t sent anything yet. I have contacted support about it, still waiting for a reply. I think everyone is going to have to cut their losses with this guy.

				Well that fucking sucks, still could come tomorrow but I don&#039;t believe that he shipped on monday because it would have been here today for sure. . . I went with Indub over Einstein777 because last time Einstein sent me a priority letter it took 6 days, but should have went again with Einstein I guess!&nbsp; People are saying they ordered at the same time as me, but did express and they were getting their stuff last tuesday and wednesday so I don&#039;t think he is just out to fuck people over but maybe he uses too much of his own product?<br /><br />&nbsp; But yeah that shit had BETTER come tomorrow because when you buy heroin, you fucking NEED it to show up in a timely fashion and I don&#039;t have another $100 waiting to spend on something my money for the pay period went to a purchase with Indub. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If it doesn&#039;t show tomorrow I will ask for a refund or proof of shipment, but I don&#039;t get it why he would try to scam someone when they did not FE, and paid for priority. . . That would just be a huge waste of time because if he cannot prove he sent me anything then I would get a 100% refund. It&#039;s just a waste of time which I DO NOT have the meds to cover that time that&#039;s why I bought some of his #4.

				He has a 98.3% rating, which is definitely a good rating. . . And people who ordered at the same time I did got their express packages earlier this week. I don&#039;t understand, there are only a few complaints compared to what seems like the vast majority of people getting their stuff fast and on point. And there is no FE so what is going on, why would he want to waste his and other people&#039;s time? I paid for priority which should be tracked so if he sent nothing, I get a refund.

				feedback review can be placed there by the vendor. It is a decent indicator when a vendor has 300+ feedback reviews, but the forum reviews are what actually matter, and those should be coming from people that are established posters and not 50 post newbies. ordering from new vendors is&nbsp; a tricky business. come to terms with losing the money and then it will be a pleasant surprise if you end up getting your stuff<br />

				He is really pissing me off. He sent me that message asking me to FE at like 6 am. I told him I wouldn&#039;t do that and asked him to go ahead and cancel it so I could find someone else. He hasn&#039;t canceled it. He won&#039;t answer me. I don&#039;t know what else to call this other than pure laziness.

				Well I&#039;m going to ask him for a&nbsp; refund, or a tracking number at this point. Such bullshit. . . Einstein777 would have come through but last time his priority letter took 6 fucking days so I did not give him repeat business this time. Silkroad owners MUST BE MORE PROACTIVE at ridding the site from jokers and scammers. They get commission from sellers, that is true, but those fucking Bitcoins come from BUYERS ya cunts! BUYERS are the ones that need to be backed up by DPR or the crew that owns the Road. Sellers need to be held to a much higher standard than they are right now. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t plan on losing any money on this transaction, it is still in escrow . . . At most I will lose some time which still pisses me the fuck off ! I guess my ONLY reliable way to get H now is to pay Nod way more than that shit is worth, but at least know it will arrive on time. And get some free coke along with it haha.

				WELL Indubitably replied to my meessage within 20 minutes, and he said &quot;It did get shipped and I put in extra to make up for it &quot;(I assume for sending it after he said he would) OKAY, now what? I wish he had told me WHEN he actually sent it. At least he did not ask me to FE, and if I receive something tomorrow that is overweight I will be satisfied. But when i ordered on Saturday, and it was marked in transit on Sunday, I expected it would have been PLENTY of time to get it in the mail by Monday morning. . . I feel like I will receive a letter from Indub but I will not likely be a repeat customer.

				I placed my order last Sunday (3/10). I looked everywhere on the envelope but couldn&#039;t find a postmark anywhere. My husband couldn&#039;t find one either. My guess is that he mailed mine on the 14th as the post office was closing like others have said he told them. Sorry you didn&#039;t get your stuff! Hopefully it&#039;ll be in your mail tomorrow.

				haha thanks for the karma.. still I got nothing today. I&#039;m beyond pissed. I bought a gram from my local neighborhood dopeman and it was leaving all kinds of garbage left over after I cooked it, made me sick last night.. the gram didn&#039;t even last me 24 hours. Maybe I just need to save up and start getting that top shelf stuff from nod.. although I&#039;ve never tried tar before, only east coast powder. Have you ever tried tar before repus??

				Hoping you get it today, brother. Indubitably is new to the SR game, so IMO he can be cut some slack on judgment. I purchased from him on a sample of Molly and received within 3 days. I am sure he has not fucked you and your order will come in. His Molly was top notch, as I hear his dope is too. So hopefully the quality/quantity makes up for it in some way! I have a feeling he will get his shit together and running smoothly over the next couple months tops. (:<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor

				Same story..I ordered the $11 sample and it never showed. I msg&#039;d him and then finalized after he assured me it would be &quot;made right&quot;. I wouldn&#039;t go into resolution over such a small amount anyway. That order never arrived. <br /><br />I wanted his other cheap listings so i ordered 2g with express on monday 3/11. The order was marked in transit a few hours later. I began messaging him when it became late that friday. He last responded the following monday 3/18. I am now in resolution and he still refuses to respond.<br /><br />I have no idea how people see in his feedback the non-deliveries and shitty gear but still order. his rating high because he sent lots of samples on the cheap and got lots of 5/5&#039;s at first. Also much of his feedback is too over the top.. I believe, like so many vendors, he has multiple accounts to bump his own score and dilute the real feedback as the shit begins.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE.. STOP ORDERING!!!!

				Wow this thread caught on after all the spammer posts were removed from the forum I guess! So here it is March 23 and I still have not received jack shit from Indub, fuck that crackhead POS. Last tuesday (10 days after I ordered) he said he would reship and send Express for free. Of course you know what happened after that. . . NOTHING. So he fucked me over twice now on the same order. I started a resolution yesterday that he is not replying to either, so the good news is that I should get 100% refund since he cannot show any proof he sent anything and his reputation should convince SR admin that it is a no-brainer to refund.<br /><br />Ordered a G from DragonCove yesterday, really hoping that is finally the stuff I have been looking for here. So far I have had 2 headache inducing shitty purchases from hell, one alright one, and I think DC is the guy who can prove what he says about quality and service. <br /><br />I would bet a bitcoin that Indub is such a fucking scrub in real life, like a total scumbag you could see a mile away. Probably lives with his parents and deals stamps he buys and repackages after cutting them 10x. I really don&#039;t want to even have anything he touched. Just my BTC back so maybe Nod4Less will hook me up. You know a vendor is horrible when another vendor has to make a sale based on the first vendor fucking everyone over! I can&#039;t believe why DPR has not called this guy out and suspended his account yet.
