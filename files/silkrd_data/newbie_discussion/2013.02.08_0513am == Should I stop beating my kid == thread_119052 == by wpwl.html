				Funny. You chose that specific title to get a lot of views. And it&#039;s very interesting how I&#039;m sure people assume you&#039;re talking about abuse.<br /><br />For those that are actually in that situation with anyone...yes, learn to share every now and then. And eat your veggies too.

				Another stupid thread. ???&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you ask a question you need to know about SR instead of creating pointless threads about bullshit?? ??? What is it with these people who think being able to open Tor and navigate to the SR Homepage is all you need to know? There is so much to know and learn, obviously a lot more than you think.

				Nah, ninetails are too unstable and don&#039;t really distribute the force of the impact... unless you&#039;re looking to flay someone (in which case get something with spurs on the falls).<br /><br />But what i want to know is, how did you train a baby goat to play CoD? :D
