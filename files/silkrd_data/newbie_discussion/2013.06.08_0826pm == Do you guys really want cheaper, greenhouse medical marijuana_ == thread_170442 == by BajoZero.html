				Hey Newbies&nbsp; ;D<br />In the past, I&#039;ve focused on only top quality, indoor grown, small crop, organic medical marijuana.&nbsp; That shit is expensive.&nbsp; There&#039;s simply nothing more that I can do to bring down my prices for buyers.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve noticed: 1. Everybody seems to want cheaper weed, and 2. The weed that most SR buyers ultimately buy tends to not be top quality.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that ultimately, everybody wants top quality drugs at low, low prices. But let&#039;s be realistic.&nbsp; Sure, in Cali, you can get weed for $1000/lb.&nbsp; But the best weed costs a hell of a lot more than that, even in Cali.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to stop offering amazing bud.&nbsp; But I know that lots of people can&#039;t afford amazing bud, and just want bud.&nbsp; So I&#039;m trying to determine whether or not I should stock lower-quality, greenhouse grown weed.&nbsp; If you buy weed on SR, please let me know what is your interest in this by responding to this poll.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Z

				Well, personally I&#039;m buying from SR because I lost my connection to good quality product where I am and I&#039;m not in a medical marijuana state. If I&#039;m buying I want quality and I&#039;m willing to pay for it but I know not everyone else can always afford that I guess. And I like that there&#039;s a lot of variety across the vendors on SR. A lot of times I don&#039;t have much of a choice buying locally.

				Well, I guess everyone has different needs and buying habits, but personally, one of my main reasons for going to SR is access to top-notch bud, since it&#039;s hard to find reliable sources in my area. In general, I think it&#039;s much easier to (locally) find mids/regs than it is to find consistently high-quality, medical-grade bud.<br /><br />Naturally everyone is going to want to get the best quality for the lowest price, but I think that many people who only want the best are willing and able to pay for it, including myself. I wouldn&#039;t necessarily agree that most SR buyers want cheaper/lower-quality weed, but then again, as a vendor you would probably know more about that than I would.<br /><br />Maybe try selling some small batches of cheaper mids along with your usual stuff and see how it goes? I&#039;m not experienced enough to offer any advice on the economics of selling bud, but I hope you give up on offering the highest quality stuff you can!

				I voted no.<br /><br />My only interest is in high grade marijuana. No reason to smoke anything else imo.<br /><br />
