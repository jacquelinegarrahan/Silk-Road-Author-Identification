				<br />Yes it is a 100 post. After that you will have the POWER!<br /><br />Just use it wisely. There are a lot of people out there that I think just enjoy giving bad karma because they can. Once you give a person karma you will have to wait 72 hours before you can give them karma again. This prevents people from abusing it.<br /><br />However I went from 0 to -6 karma in just a few hours for reasons unknown to me. Feel free to look up all of my previous post through my profile and see if it was deserved.<br /><br />There was also a thread awhile back where everyone who posted in it received -30 karma! Not sure how that happened either.

The truth is that lots people give negative karma simply because they disagree with you, no matter how polite, insightful, or helpful you try to be. Or for whatever random reason, maybe they love having the power to be assholes. Don&#039;t pay attention to karma, say what you have to say and don&#039;t worry about anything else.
