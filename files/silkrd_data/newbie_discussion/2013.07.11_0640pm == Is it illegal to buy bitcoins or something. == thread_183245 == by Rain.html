				Bitcoins are legal..<br /><br />They are just implementing new regulations for them.<br /><br />What most people are talking about it just trying to buy them in a dark ally, because with enough research, coins can be traced.. even sometimes to identity if you are not careful.

				Buying bitcoin is not illegal, but a lot of people that are on here do not want to associate themselves with bitcoin, so therefor they are willing to go a long way to stay anonymous when purchasing btc.<br /><br />The most convenient way of acquiring btc is often to do a bank transfer, but this will also compromise your anonymity (at least if you are using your own bank to make the purchase).<br />

				Okay say you bought bitcoins with a verified paypal account then you deposit them too bitfog, how many days would one have to leave your bitcoin in bitfog to make it hard to track?

				You can even transfer it to 1-2 wallets before going to the fog, so they don&#039;t even have a direct link from your named account to it. Of course they CAN check the 2-3 additional steps if they really want, but at least it&#039;s not suspicious at first glance, if something is checking these transaction against the fog (e.g the site itself where you bought them).<br /><br />I think the initial 6 hours are enough in the fog, especially if you break up your transaction to 2-3 parts, in a way that a small fraction even stays in your fog wallet (amount matching negated). Then send the 3 parts with 6, 8 and 10 hours of tumbling to your SR. You should be as safe as one can be.

				Oh yeah, one more thing: you can use 3 different SR wallets for the 3 transactions.

				Nothing wrong with buying bitcoins. However it&#039;s never a bad idea to stay anonymous. If a case does get built on you being affiliated with bitcoin purchases doesn&#039;t look the best if you get caught purchasing/selling drugs through the mail.

				It&#039;s no more illegal to buy bitcoin than it is to exchange US dollars for Canadian dollars, or any other sort of currency exchange. It&#039;s also not illegal to buy a digital lab scale and a thousand tiny ziplock baggies, but you just have to know that when you do, people will assume you&#039;re up to some mischief. Fair or not, bitcoin is associated with illegal activity.
