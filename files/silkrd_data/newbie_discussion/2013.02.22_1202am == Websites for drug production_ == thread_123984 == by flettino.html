				I&#039;d really like to start making drugs, like MDA and stuff like that.<br /><br />Is there a TOR website which has discussions about drug production ? even non tor websites, i can&#039;t find them anywhere. <br /><br />Thanks, F.

				So, there are plenty of places you can find synthesis&#039;s. The real problem is getting reagents. Sure you may find some precursors but you will be damn hard pressed to have everything you need. MDA and the like are much more difficult to synthesize than the nasty meth you see getting cooked inside of walmart on the news. <br /><br />Its pretty clear that you dont possess the general or organic chemistry knowledge to even know what to search for to find the synthesis you are after. Plus, the synthesis that is actually available to you will most likely not be spelled out in some paper on say.. rhodium or the hive or sciencemadness. You have to know what kind of reaction you need to perform etc and then look those up individually. There is also a huge problem that 99.9% of people do not even realize exists.. Paper chemistry is really easy.. Once you get into the lab and start putting dollar signs on everything and start realizing that many reactions are difficult to get to go to more than a 50% or so yield. The financial loss is compounded by the fact that you now have to SEPARATE your products from any side reaction products, as well as any unreacted starting materials.. Which only means more solvents, etc.. Which all gets difficult to remove without a rotovap etc.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Chemistry is a rather difficult to subject to master, and without a university education(and chemical connects), one will most likely find failure in their path, hopefully not one that ends with an explosion in your face.

				pihkal has recipes for&nbsp; MDA MDMA&nbsp; mescaline, 2C-B and many many other compounds<br />tihkal&nbsp; has many tryptamine recipes&nbsp; &nbsp; such as psilocybin and dmt, 5-meo-dmt&nbsp; etc<br /><br />firstly your need to study organic chemistry&nbsp; &nbsp;this may take 2+ years for you <br />second&nbsp; before you even think about the precursors&nbsp; &nbsp;you must consider that most of these recipes involve using glove boxes, fume hoods, bunsen burners. don&#039;t be suprised if equipment all together equipment cost money in the thousands<br /><br /><br /><br />so.. if you think your intelligent enough to learn organic chemistry, have money to invest, and can obtain precursors (some available on SR)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;then&nbsp; thats were you start.<br /><br />tbh the most marketable drugs are ones that are easy to make though&nbsp; &nbsp;i.e. meth, heroin, marijuana, cocaine.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Get yourself a solid connect for lab supplies (this is actually really fucking hard to find).. And PM me up when it happens so i can get some of them tasty reagents!<br /><br />Sorry to thread jack, i need 50 and i figured i would use this as my own personal list of shit.

				I&#039;m sure everyone&#039;s thought like this, then they get overwhelmed with the information and risk and give up. The people out there who do make this stuff are incredible.

				I always wonder what the yield is of the illicit chemists. Since purification of the product is usually the most difficult, I would think they have some perfect technique with extremely high yields so they only have to wash and dry.
