				I have an acct with localbitcoins.com.<br /><br />The email of that account is tormail. Which is still OOS.<br /><br />I placed an order this am with a seller to buy some BTC after I trusted him and gave my SMS.<br />They were supposed to send me their bank account # and I was going to do a bank transfer to it.<br /><br />I waited 90 minutes on the order page, sent a few inquiries, even provided an alternate email address. Never heard from them so I cancelled the order (excrow) with 2 minutes remaining.<br /><br />My question is-- did they send their account no. to my tormail address (OOS) or are they supposed to reply on localbitcoins.com order page. They did not acknowledge the three messages I sent to them on the order page.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your feedback.<br /><br />Toke it ez&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				I feel like you should have checked both sms and email to figure that out.(sorry i sound cranky i just woke up.) I know my guy just sent me his info in the messages on localbitcoins. If he didn&#039;t reply then he went offline. I know the process only took me like 15 minutes before I had the coins. <br /><br />Ryno

				Doesn&#039;t sound very good on their half with no response. Might have not been on.<br /><br />They should provide their bank information (if its a bank transfer, cash deposit) in the View/Message Invoice associated with the order. The same place where you can see your message sent with your request. You should receive a notification when they reply with information.<br /><br />You could check on their profile when they were last seen( activity). Probably just poor communication on their part.<br /><br />Best of luck.

				you should also make sure you are within there contact hours of the vendor as well....but they should respond to you right away on the localbitcoins page because once you send a trade request it has the chat window underneath your BTC inquiry and order form....that is the nice things about localbitcoins only the buyer can cancel the trade and since it seems like it didnt go thru for you...no money lost just got to look for a different vendor....its weird tho cause i had coins literally 5 seconds after i provided my guy with the receipt of transaction , most vendors i encountered have been 10 minutes or less in getting coins out....hopefully you find a different guy.

				Here is the update. The seller said he was 24/7/365, and had recent unconfirmed feedback, so it appeared they were available. There was no bank info in the reply window. Never did figure that one out.<br /><br />But a few hours later, went back on to another seller at lbc. This time the sellers info was all on the page without having to wait or ask, so I went and sent it, and after an hour got my btc in my localbitcoin wallet. Success!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />So now I want to move it around a few times before putting it into my SR account. Want to make at least two hops to get it nice and clean. <br /><br />Tks for all the replies! It&#039;s all good! see you on the road&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				An hour WHOA... my guys get me my coins literally under a minute after I send confirmation of deposit. I&#039;d be freaking out if it took an hour, lol.... Anyways just watch the fees even mrbrownfuzz mentioned above id a little higher than my go to. I typically pay about 3 - 4 % above ask and thats usually still a little lower than SR average at the time of purchase. Get here quick and make a nice turn around on them :)

				So here is my story about localbitcoins:<br /><br />I am just new to this all, informed myself and thought it is now time to start. So i chose a trader (he had not much sells but all with positive response) and asked in the forum about getting in contact. Contact is not possible without starting a buy (or sell). <br />This was a moment I just had to get rid of.... I clicked buy and immediately after this sent a message to the trader. And a second one, and a third one (as I told you, I am a newbie). No response to any message....<br />Now I had to decide whether cancel the trade or go into it and send the money (to get my bitcoins into escrow and get them at a price that seemed ok for me :-)). <br />I sent the money to the given bank account (never forget to add the reference here!). <br />What now came was a long time of waiting and being not sure if this was right. I got the first message after over 18(!) hours (info that trader awaits the money and will then release the coins). But my bitcoins were in my wallet within 24 hours too. But in my case I also had to consider that SEPA needs about one day to get my money to the traders account. So in the end I was happy, the trader was not as bad as I thought and everything went right. <br />Maybe this is a very unusual amount of time it took, nevertheless I think not every trader has the time to answer everybody immediately (who knows how many requests they have if they provide a good price). <br />All in all I think localbitcoins is a good way to get bitcoins, if you ignore some scamming (which also appears in the forum there). <br />Give it a try! <br />

				Yesterday was a busy day. After I got some coins, I sent them through the fog and changed my password before going to SR acct. <br /><br />Installed Thunderbird/Enigmail as an alternate PGP contact method, and it works great. Tormail is unreliable.<br /><br />Made another private key and stored all my important stuff on a locked USB. Backups of backups. <br /><br />Woke up this morning ready to go shopping.&nbsp; &nbsp; :P :D<br /><br /><br />

				I was on LocalBtc earlier on. <br />You contact a vendor via clicking on their page and then getting their details, I personally only ever use vendors with hundreds of feedback, and a number to call. <br />Then you ask them if they have the coins, They say yes, You ask them to fund the transaction, Make sure its in escrow as you did . <br />Then you deposit funds into their bank account, there should be a message bit on the transaction page that you can chat with them on. <br />They release the funds and your good to go. <br /><br />But the bit that you were confused about, Below the bit where it says it has been funded there should be a chat section where they send the details and you can answer them back :)
