				I liked bitinstant because i could make an order and then pay for it at walmart, very simple. Now that bitinstant doesnt work in my state I need the next best alternative that i dont need to use a credit card or bank account for. I&#039;ve tried signing up for some of the other popular sites, but I cannot tell if they work with payment through walmart or MO etc.

				I&#039;ve not had any problems with BitInstant in my state - although I feel the same way as does Mcrad as far as liking them better before they changed it to where you pretty much have to create an account with them...&nbsp; but since there&#039;s not really anything preventing you from using fake info, that&#039;s not really that big of a deal to me.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t heard before seeing this post that any other states are not dealing with BitInstant or vice verse...<br /><br />A couple things to know though:<br /><br />When you pay cash to buy BTC from BitInstant, you&#039;re not really buying the BTC from WalMart (as some seem to think), rather you&#039;re using MoneyGram - a separate entity, which just happens to be located among other places in most if not all WalMart stores, of which there are many - making it probably the most commonly used Money Gram location for most people.<br /><br />Also, in case there is a State or several States in which BitInstant really doesn&#039;t operate, there are probably several other options for anonymous cash transactions.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t personally dealt with or know of any other than one which I&#039;ve done business with and not had any problems.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nanaimogold out of Canada accepts Western Union cash transfers and processes them fairly quickly.&nbsp; Even almost instantly if you care to pay an additional $7.00 (approx) fee for that service.&nbsp; I used w/u and didn&#039;t&#039; pay the extra fee and my coins were in my wallet within a couple of hours after I made the transfer.. so... just my one experience with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;They don&#039;t ask for much in the way of personal info either...&nbsp; &nbsp;(I think though that overall, they are more expensive overall than BitInstant).. still, an alternative if you need one.&nbsp; AFAIK, they operate in all 50 States....<br /><br />

				Localbitcoins.com. you will meet and greet with seller, and do an even exchange for btc. Pay with cash. Meet in public place. Instant transfer of btc. Alot simpler than moneypak, and i&#039;ll never trust that fucking bitinstant ever again! Hope this helps

Using fake info with Bitinstant can lead to them holding your payment until you contact them about it. Another thing that is annoying about Bitinstant is that if you make two similar payments in the same day, they hold one of the payments until you contact them in case one is a duplicate payment. They had a limit set at $500 per transaction, so it was necessary to make more than one payment to get more than $500 worth of coin loaded.&nbsp; When you buy bitcoin through Bitinstant, you are actually buying it through a California based company called ZipZap.

				I had a issue with using a bank account.. But you get screwed on the surcharge/fee prices when you do it the other way.. So why don&#039;t you use a legit account if you can.. then have several block chain wallets and just randomly transfer the BTCs soo you stay anonymous . Would love a response from the Vets btw.

				Just used BitInstant today in the US and service was quick. Got a confirmation email while I was still in the Grocery store. The fee is minimum, only $25 on $500 order and when compared to BoA transfers it beats it every time. Only downside is they require ID / sign up and the $500 maximum is a pain in the ass, but nothing is stopping me from making multiple transfers as far as I know. It took thirty - forty five minutes max to hit my BlockChain Account and then from there to SR it was an hour. It was a wonderful first experience and I plan to use them every time unless something awful happens. Oh and the best part about it when it hit my SR account I wasn&#039;t $25 short anymore but more like $18. Now, three hours later, I am four dollars away from breaking even. <br /><br />I was so close to using BitStamp but if it weren&#039;t for BoA&#039;s ridiculous international charges (and domestic at that), and 2 to 5 business days to clear. <br /><br />In my opinion, I hope BitInstant is here to stay.<br /><br />This has been a wonderful day. Now excuse me while I go buy a big bag of drugs.&nbsp; :P

				I gave up on Bitinstant when they started asking me questions about where I lived and what cars I owned like 30 years ago. I use Localbitcons now and the guy just meets me at Starbucks and does the transaction right there on his smart phone. No high fees, no anal probe.

				Every person I&#039;ve seen that has given humbolt positive reviews on the forum were accounts created within the past week. Seems a bit risky, if you guys get your money and he&#039;s still going strong then I&#039;ll consider using him in a few weeks.

				true, and many of the glowing vendor feedback is from 0btc orders, which could be placed numerous times by anyone with an account.&nbsp; but there was positive feedback left on orders for marijuana which can indicate they are at least sending out product and buyers are receiving it.&nbsp; no btc yet, but they sent me a status update message so we will see...

				I gave him HumboltGreenGarden $280 MP about 19 hours ago. About 18 hours ago I asked him how long for the transfer. He sent me a message 5 hours later saying it would be 2 hours tops. That was 13 hours ago. I messaged him about 5 hours ago to check on things. I’m still waiting for the transfer and / or a response. Meanwhile, that listing is no longer there. I just looked at the listing 3 hours ago. It had to have been taken down some time over the past couple of hours. Listing was taken down but he still hasn&#039;t opened my messages. I will update when the situation changes.<br />

				Update: <br /><br />I checked the MoneyPak and it still hadn&#039;t been touched. So I used it myself and told vendor to cancel order. I still haven&#039;t heard anything from this vendor. Its been almost 24 hours since I placed this order and he never touched the MP. Eventhough at one point he said 2 hours. Staying away from this guy and others like him. Learned my lesson and at least I got my money.
