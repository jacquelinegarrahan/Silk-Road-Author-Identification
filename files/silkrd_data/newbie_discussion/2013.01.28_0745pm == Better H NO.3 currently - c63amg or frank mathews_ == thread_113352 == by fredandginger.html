				Hi Guys,<br /><br />was just wondering, if any of you have tries them both recently who has the better stuff?&nbsp; I have ordered from c63amg a few times, has always arrived to the UK very quick in amazing packaging and quality has always been good.<br /><br />I ordered from Frank Matthews one time, and he requires FE, and the order didnt show up (the only time i havent received an order from Silk Road in the 20+ orders I have made with various vendors from all over the world) I got a 50% refund, which is better than nothing.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, Franks is cheaper, and seems to be one of the best sellers in the H department, so I am keen to try it.&nbsp; I am just a bit weary of FE&#039;ing again, to the only person that i havent received from, even though I am sure it wasnt his fault these things can just happen and i was just unlucky, as he wouldnt be such a popular vendor if he regularly had orders not showing up.<br /><br />Just wondering if I should stick with a vendor I know whose package will arrive and pay the little bit extra, or take another chance with Frank Matthews and pay less, but have to FE (which I dont like being an established buyer with lots of transactions and no refund rate) and risk the package not arriving?!<br />

				I haven&#039;t had c63&#039;s dope, but I have had consistently high quality no.3 from Frank Matthews. Six orders, five of which arrived in good time with excellent packaging, excellent quality and spot on or slightly over weight.<br /><br />The caveat to this is, for the first time ever in 8 months ordering from SilkRoad, my order from Frank has not arrived. It&#039;s been fifteen days now. At ten days he asked me to wait a little longer. <br /><br />I sincerely hope this is resolved - there are others reporting recent delivery problems with Frank - where an earlier order has not made it, but subsequent orders have. It looks like some problem has arisen in the past fortnight for some deliveries.<br /><br />That aside, he&#039;s excellent. I personally expect to be ordering from him again as soon as this difficulty is resolved.

				Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; As I have heard all good things about Franks stuff I was quite frustrated when I didnt receive it, especially due to his requirements for all orders to FE (regardless of purchasing stats, which I really dont like)<br /><br />Just for your information, if you do start having problems with Frank, I highly recommend C63AMG.&nbsp; His packaging is by FAR the best I have ever received on all my orders from this site, and it always arrives very quickly, and he is very quick to respond to messages!<br /><br />I recently (late last night) ordered a half G from Afghan Apothecary, who has just started stocking it in the last couple of days.&nbsp; Now I am not expecting as higher quality as C63 or Franks, but the price was very low, so couldnt resist, and his reputation is very good, and he is a very established seller, so I am hoping that he wouldnt start selling low quality product which could tarnish this reputation he has worked hard to achieve.&nbsp; It is already marked in transit, so I am hoping he is a vendor that only marks in transit once it has been sent!&nbsp; I will update once I have given it a test (hopefully arriving tomorrow!)<br /><br />Also, if you are UK - I would highly recommend TopNotch&#039;s strong afghan stuff.&nbsp; It is a little pricey, but not over the top expensive, and is just as good, if not better than other NO.3 I have ordered from non-uk vendors.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />F&amp;G

				<br />&nbsp;Hey juste ordered 0,5 G of N°3 from Frank.<br /><br />&nbsp;Got it in 2 days. I&#039;m not used to Heroïn. (especially this quality)<br /><br />&nbsp;When i told my friend i was so fucking sick after a snort of 0,1 g, puked all my guts in the toilets...<br /><br />&nbsp;If i had no heroïnoman friend i would definitely throw it in the bin...<br /><br />&nbsp;Too strong for me, If i had took 2 snorts of 0,25 as usual i would be dead by now.<br /><br />&nbsp;This H is serious shit take fucking care, personally i&#039;m done with H since this last expérience...

				for someone who doesnt do it that much, snorting 0.25 in one go is a pretty large amount!&nbsp; When i do it i buy £10ers worth at a time, and smoke it over a period of between 10 mins and an hour, depending on how im feeling, and that gets me in a good place.&nbsp; Doing a quarter of a gram hitting you instantly for an irregular user sounds like quite a lot to me!&nbsp; Are you definitely talking about the brown no.3 and not the white no.4? As just from what I have heard brown no.3 isnt that great for snorting, its the white no.4 that is the one for the nose from everything I have read / heard?

				Ha! Chinotraf.......You are comical that is the first time I have ever&nbsp; heard someone complain about Heroin or any other tackle for that matter being to STRONG. I think Frank would like you to tell everyone its too strong ha! comical. You certainly cannot be a seasoned&nbsp; heroin addict, no addict worth his salt would refuse to touch the best goddam heroin in N.L. I suggest you bash it ( mix) it with manitol and lower the strength. Jeez that&#039;s cheered me up!!

				<br />&nbsp; I know you&#039;re right northern, when I told my friend I puked all my guts in the toilets he laughed out loud ^^<br /><br />&nbsp;But I ordered for him not for me i just wanted to try it...<br /><br />&nbsp;I shouldn&#039;t had :/<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know how ppl can get addicted to this stuff... Smells like shit, taste horrible and after all this, you get sick...<br /><br />&nbsp;What&#039;s the point ? :D

				as i said, i think if you dont do it very often, and your body is not used to opiates, sniffing that much and having it hit you all at once is probably why it makes you sick?<br /><br />as i said, i do it semi-regularly, and a 0.1 - 0.2 smoked over a period of time (so not all hitting me at once, but gradually) gets me in a great place.&nbsp; I think if that amount hit me all at once i would prob be sick too...as i said, is the stuff you have sniffed the brown number 3 stuff or the white number 4?

				&nbsp;To answer your question I snorted 0,1 g of brown n°3, twice.<br /><br />&nbsp;First time i was fucking stoned like hell. I knew from the deep of my stomach that I needed to puke, but I did&#039;nt for the first one.<br /><br />&nbsp;The second one, I was even more stoned like hell than the first time. I just puked a bit of héroïn after 1 hour then i went off to bed, I can&#039;t even tell you what time it was, how long it took, I have memory holes...<br /><br />&nbsp;The morning after, I woke up with a god damned headhache, with a god damned desire of vomiting in the toilets.<br />&nbsp;That&#039;s what I did twice, then fucking feel bad all day long...<br /><br />&nbsp;I just start to feel better now and I could eat a little bit :)<br /><br />&nbsp;In France we don&#039;t have that kind of brown, I can easily snort 0,25 g of brown in France, (bad quality i guess) withouth puking or anything. <br />&nbsp;The more i snorted was 0,5g at once, I puked once and that was okay.<br />&nbsp;In my country, They all said that for a non-addict person i have a good resistance to the product, i did not puke first time i snorted and just vomit a few times only after snorting...<br />&nbsp;That&#039;s why i wanted to try it out, now i&#039;m convinced I suck and this batch beats me really hard...<br /><br />&nbsp;I think i was not aware of what was coming to me. (into my nose ahah)<br />&nbsp;I know it was my fault but i have no regrets, now i can say : I tried fucking strong stuff from NL and you ? :D<br /><br />&nbsp;But seriously i mean no offense or anything but my friend who&#039;s on heroïn since more than 10 years looks like fucking death itself.<br />&nbsp;I bet I can print his face for an album cover of my metal band and have great success !!!<br /><br />&nbsp;I tried to push him back from that stuff many times with no success.<br />&nbsp;Nevertheless he can still live his life like the others, very well orgganized person and clean but I lived with him for 1 year and he&#039;s just unbearable... (umor issues, always upset and these kinds of stuff...)<br /><br />&nbsp;I mean if you&#039;re addicted to this shit you have to move away from this drug sooner or later...<br /><br />&nbsp;The sooner, the better...

				If your ever planning on doing it again, and its the brown stuff, try smoking it off some foil, it is the best way by far to use brown number 3 H.&nbsp; I am not including IV in this as I have a ridiculous phobia of needles of any kind, even at the hospital, so wont be going near one!&nbsp; and from what I hear snorting brown isnt the best way to do it as it needs acidity to dissolve (thats why IV users disolve it in citric acid or something before injecting it, and the liquid in your nose is not very acidic so it doesnt absorb that effectively.&nbsp; Also, smoking it is much nicer as you can smoke a bit, then take a break, and then smoke some more if you want to feel more of the buzz.&nbsp; If you snort it, you cant take less, but if you smoke it and you feel like you want more you can just have a few more lines off the foil!<br /><br />If you want to snort H buy some Number 4 - the white stuff.&nbsp; But definitely dont be snorting 0.25 at once, especially if you have a low tolerance / resistance!&nbsp; I have never tried number 4, i have just smoked brown number 3, but i have heard number 4 is MUCH stronger, and people with low tolerances get a good hit from a match head sized bump up their nose if the gear is good! So I imagine a trip to the hospital would be on the cards if you sniffed a quarter of a gram of that stuff at once!<br /><br />Anyway, the original question doesnt look like its going to be answered!&nbsp; Never mind eh!<br /><br />Peace

				<br />&nbsp;Thanks fredandinger.<br /><br />&nbsp;To tell you, I already &quot;chased te dragon&quot; on a foil with low quality hash in my Country and I felt nothing. I wasn&#039;t truly prepared to snort that stuff and I tought smoking it would not be enough for me. I guess i was wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;I will try it that way but not now ^^<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway, about your original question, i can tell you that I didn&#039;t try c63amg stuff but Frank stuff seems pretty hard H my friend is gonna inject this shit directly into his blood so he&#039;s gonna feel the whole thing at once ^^<br /><br />&nbsp;Peace.

				Chino, If you&#039;re going to score again, just toot it dude, you can put a tiny bit on the foil say size of a match head, then just burn with lighter. It&#039;s called spotting it, that way you won&#039;t be sick. Mate people only ever sniff Heroin when the haven&#039;t got foil or hitting up kit. Generally when they are Rattling =withdrawing I think you guys call it dope sick?. The best advice I could give you now would be please don&#039;t smoke/snort any more or you will become addicted mate, try a less severe drug like Weed or Even Beek (cocaine) They are less addictive ( well mentally but not physically like the brown) And you have a chance. Stay safe !

				Chino - You chased the dragon with hash?!&nbsp; Have never heard of anyone doing that!&nbsp; And definitely dont snort hash, or any other form of cannabis for that matter!&nbsp; smoking brown H on foil will be very different - it is the way most people use it!<br /><br />Northern star - I think a lot of people snort H, just not in europe, as the stuff in europe is usually the brown stuff, which is meant for smoking (or injecting if you mix it with citric acid).&nbsp; In the US and where the white number 4 H is more available, I think a lot of people snort it, its very common.&nbsp; The white stuff is not smokeable, it is just for IV or snorting.&nbsp; But yeah you are right, dont do any form of H too much, it will get ya!<br />
