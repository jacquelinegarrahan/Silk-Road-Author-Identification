				way way way, back in the day. I only consumed coke via IV. Crack wasn&#039;t around then (Late 70&#039;s, early 80&#039;s)<br />The only &quot;Crack&quot; I have smoked, was made by me, I have no experience at this&nbsp; ;D The amount returned was next to nothing, due the fact of very shitty street coke around here&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I got a little buzz, but I have always heard, it&#039;s the bomb 8)<br />I was wondering what the best way was, IV or Smoking... tell me what you think ;)

				Found some info on How to make Crack from Cocaine<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well, SWIM really wants to share a little info, so here it goes:<br /><br /><br />1. SWIM takes a piece of foil (prefferably the thicker kind) about 12 inches long, and 7-8 inches wide.<br /><br />2. SWIM cuts the coke up... and it doesn&#039;t even have to be finely chopped, having little rocks makes it better actually.<br /><br />3. Now, SWIM can do a small bump of a line and put it on the foil (on the shiny side and on the bottom half of the 12 inches) but it will make just one hit (a good hit, but only one) OR SWIM can put a pretty fat line and get at least 3-4 really good hits. If SWIM makes big foilys then SWIM runs out quicker and the craving seems a little stronger. If SWIM makes 1-2 hit foilys then it lasts longer, and doesn&#039;t seem as strong of a craving.<br /><br />4. SWIM gets some baking soda and sprinkles some on top of the coke. The ratio here is essential, SWIM usually does 1/3 baking soda and 2/3 coke, but sometimes almost half and half if there&#039;s a lot of coke.<br /><br />5. SWIM puts his finger in some clean water, lets the first drop fall off his finger (not on the coke) and then uses the remaining water to mix it. Making sure he has enough water on his finger, because if not it will make a paste and it wont stick to the foil. He usually mixes in a circle from the inside out, because it mixes it the best. Remember SWIM is trying to mix all the baking soda with all the coke evenly, that&#039;s what makes it work best with the most consistency.<br /><br />6. SWIM lets it dry anywhere from 20 seconds to a couple minutes. Fold the top half of the 12 inches over the now white spot on the foil. Fold the edges over eachother to seal the inside and make an envelope shape. SWIM is always careful not to spread the mix to far to the edges because he has to fold them over a couple times to make sure the smoke doesn&#039;t come out.<br /><br />7. This is a very important part... SWIM lights his lighter, and makes passes underneath the foil (about 4 inches underneath) and he has to go slow but quick, it sounds hard but others get it by just trying a couple times. Watch the inside on the white spot, the white will disappear and you know it&#039;s been burned enough. If while on this step SWIM starts to see smoke, he&#039;s burned it too long. It only wastes a little, but he&#039;ll be craving it later in the night. Anwyays, now it&#039;s ready to smoke...<br /><br />8. SWIM lights the lighter and puts it about 2 inches underneath and holds it in one spot until smoke starts to form. Then he takes a rolled up peice of paper or any kind of tube and uses it to suck up the smoke. If SWIM makes one with a perfect mix, all he can say is GOD DAMN!<br /><br /><br />Hopefully a lot of people will use this info and try to make one really good foily to see if they like it... it saves your nose and in SWIMs opinion uses a lot less coke then snorting plus you get a lot more fucked up!<br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Source Clearnet<br />drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=32429#ixzz2W4KB9ojg<br />
