				Ive been ordering from him a few times. The first 2 times it took over a week (7 days) to another EU country. The 3rd time it didnt arrive at all (doubt he even send it), and now the 4th time its been over a week already.<br /><br />So Iam worried I wont recive the package this time aswell, and if I were to contact him it would take atleast 2 days before he replies, and the replay would just be hurrdurr wait 17 days before contact me.<br /><br />So thats why Iam creating this thread, to see how long you other ppls order took before arriving.

				Well I&#039;ve been waiting 8 days for mine. Am convinced that he never actually sent it as when I changed my feedback to 1 out of 5 he messaged me offering a reship if I switch my feedback to a 5! I said I&#039;ll do that when I actually receive the product!<br /><br />Looks very much to me like he is a selective FE scammer. Yeah some people will receive product but quite a few will get nothing.

				My order finally arrived today, also to the UK. It took two weeks to get here from Germany to the UK and I was starting to believe I&#039;d been selectively scammed. In fact it was posted on the day it should have been, the date of posting is on the printed stamp. Why it was so late I don&#039;t know, but it was the postal system&#039;s fault, not Supertrip&#039;s fault.<br /><br />As for everything else, yes it&#039;s super high quality and the deal was significantly overweight. I&#039;ll be back for more sometime :)
