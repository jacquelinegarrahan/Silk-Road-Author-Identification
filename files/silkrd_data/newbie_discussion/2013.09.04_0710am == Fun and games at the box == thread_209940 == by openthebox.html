				If you read the torrent forums youll know that a private uk tv tracker called the box closed at the end of august. Or did it.<br /><br />The box users said they got under a weeks warning it was closing cos the guys who ran it said they were under presure from the new antipiracy LE which was starting in september. The box always made a big thing of it being a real comunity with the staff doing everything they could to help&nbsp; everyone so people took it hard and everyone was saying how sad they were and how good the guys running it had been to them but they could understand them stopping the site if it meant they wouldnt be arrested. At the same time everyopne was expecting an unlimited free leach seeing as the site was ending but they didnt get it and no one understood why none of the staff even answered when they asked for it. People even got banned for downloading too much on the last day. WTF.<br /><br />Now the fun starts. Strait away rumors started that a third of the 90000 members got a message from the box staff to go to zxcv.fm where the box had moved to and they could log in with their old user name and password but they had to keep it secret. The new adress was in articles on torrent news sites but disapeared the next day but its still in some foreign articles. People who posted comments about a new site got attacked for being LE setting up a honeypot or accused of being a scammer trying to get people to go to a phishing site.<br /><br />Then there were rumors of people saying on the zxcv forum they were policing other torrent forums and making anyone who posted about the new site look stupid. They also said theyd posted comments telling people not to visit zxcv cos theyd been to that adress and got malware on their computer. They boasted theyd got torrent freak to edit their articles and had got reddit to take out links to the new site and that theyd deleted it from wikipedia but it is still in some cached pages when you do a search.<br /><br />Then people started asking why they hadnt got an invitation but there mates had. Some guys said that only people who had donated to the box got invitations and other guys said it was how long you were a memeber or what your ratio was. There were screenshots put up of the secret message and the new site but people said they were photoshopped. Its confusing cos theres lots of lying going on.<br /><br />Theres plenty of articles about the box closing but they dont say anything about all the rumours not even to say theyre not true. The new site exists all right cos i&#039;ve been there and AFAIK I didnt get any malware, but all it is is a login page so idk. If someone with a rep said the new site was a scam then thatd end it but no one has and those who said a few days ago that the site was genuine havesuddenly stoppped saying anything.<br /><br />I reckon the old site closed cos the guys running it thought theyd be the first target of the new LE cos theyre the biggest uk torrent site. So they decided to become more low key and get rid fo most of the members hoping itd take the heat off. If they were going to close down completley theres no way theyd not have a free leach cos they have lots of limited free leaches for birthdays and haloween and other times, and they didnt have any free leach at all which in my book is a dead giveaway. Maybe they didnt say anything til just before they closed it cos they didnt want their old enemy uknova or another torrent site to download all their torrents cos they needed them for the new site. Thats why they stopped giving out invitations a few months ago when they started planning to close the old site and start the new one.<br /><br />If im right then theres 30000 folk smug as fuck cos they&#039;ve been invited to this not so secret torrent site as well as all the undercover LE who were probably the first to know, and there&#039;s 60000 going to feel well pissed when they find out theyve been lied to and abandoned by the comunity they thought they were part of. Or can the internet keep a secret.<br /><br />49 more posts to go.<br />
