				It&#039;s DR1 who has recently been banned and is now acting like a little bitch. <br />I&#039;ve reported all of his posts and am sure that the mods will clean up as soon as possible.

				lol, i just noticed the report to mod link. reporting ain&#039;t something i like to do tbh, but this could be pretty serious shit.<br /><br />would sr advise you if your PI was ever posted like this? i would want to know myself so i could start finding a new shipping addy. they&#039;d be throwing you to the wolves if they didn&#039;t.

				at the end of the day the cops ain&#039;t gonna bust you because you once bought some drugs on sr, coz they&#039;d know full well the drugs would likely be long gone. as long as the people who&#039;s PI has been posted get notified and can take appropriate steps, i really can&#039;t see what harm he can do to silk road as a whole.<br /><br />i think most of us in this game accepted it was a risky business a long time ago.

				I wouldn&#039;t put it past American L/E, however in the UK this information would be used for intelligence purposes. All they need is a name and address and your arrested for conspiracy.<br />I mean come on 1 guy asks another &quot; hey can you score me some coke?&quot; &quot; yes, no problem&quot; then your done for conspiring to supply. Hell the even sell you drugs there, and then have the cheek to arrest YOU! At least the police here would never use these teqniques as it amounts to entrapment. Long live the Queen..I&#039;d rather get nicked here when the feaces hits the fan, and were all arrested like annomnymous were not long ago.
