				Hello again. Yesterday, after the attack on the site, my coins disappeared from my account. At first I thought it was a problem with the site since it was running so slow. Then today, I&#039;ve checked my account history and there was a withdrawal. Lucky for me it wasn&#039;t too much (0.36 BTC) but I wanted to use them today and now they are gone.<br /><br />The thing is, I&#039;m pretty sure I don&#039;t have keyloggers and 99% sure I&#039;m using the right address (I have it memorized). What else could it be so I don&#039;t make the same mistake again? It worries me that they got the password (which WAS easy to guess) but they also got the PIN.<br /><br />I will reset everything and I think Ill set up a laptop with tails for my tor activities (using windows right now) but it still worries me that there could be other ways of hacking accounts that can&#039;t be prevented. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The most common reason for losing your coins is having accessed SR via a phishing site.&nbsp; You haven&#039;t use the hidden wiki to access SR or any other link page have you?<br /><br />Did add a PIN number to your account?&nbsp; The PIN number that is needed to complete any order or transfer of BTC from your account.

				Yep, anyone wanting to move your coins would need your account password AND your PIN.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely that at some point, you logged in via a phishing link and provided your PIN.<br /><br />Change your password immediately.

				I&#039;ll do it as soon as the site goes up, and I hope it doesn&#039;t happen again :(
