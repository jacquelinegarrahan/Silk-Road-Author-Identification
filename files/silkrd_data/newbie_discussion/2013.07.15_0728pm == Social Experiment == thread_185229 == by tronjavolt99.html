				I’m running an experiment in generosity on this site and see what types of caliber of people are on here and how it is around the world. If you have BTC change left in your accounts send it to me as a sign that people are around the world are a generous lot. I recently got taken for some money on here in a bit coin scam it wasn’t a lot but it did hurt. Here in the USA it’s almost imposable to buy bit coins anonymously with cash so I tried it here and got scammed. So anyone reading this can see it there heart to help a brother out and send your change, I would have a renewed feeling of support that this site and all the people on here are the kind of people I am. Down the road the Karma would come back 10 fold. And I’ll give you a heartfelt thank you on top of that and that alone is priceless. I’ll look forward to hearing from all of you spiritual guides and we’ll see how this goes. If it works the way I think it will I’ll mention it in my new book of People are People around the world, It’s our governments that screw it up. Blessing to all!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sorry, bro. The more and more I skim-read, the less and less it sounds like an &quot;experiment&quot; to me.<br />When I think &#039;social experiment&#039; I think research I read about in academic journals, research articles...

Refusal on my part is the same either way.

				What&#039;s annoying is him calling it a fucking social experiment. OP, shut up and go to the spare coins thread or be up front and just ask for a loan instead of trying to pass off your begging as a social experiment, prick. By the way your book sound like doodies in the toilet, try promoting it in a different light next time.<br />Sorry for being rash today I&#039;m out of bud and on the rag.

You were just being frank. Props, dude.
