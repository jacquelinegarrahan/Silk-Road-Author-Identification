				The powder form of some pills (e.g.: alprazolam) seems to be cheaper than the actual pills. Could I just buy empty gelatin capsules and fill them with powder?<br /><br />Would that be a ton of work? Also, I presumably wouldn&#039;t fill the whole capsule with alprazolam powder, so what else should I put in there? Or do I just leave a gap?

				Sure, you can &quot;cap&quot; them.&nbsp; Doing a bunch though can be a bitch... you can buy like filler machines, but those, you&#039;ll see.<br /><br />Just leave a gap.<br /><br />

				yep, a ton of work to put in capsules and hard to measure out beforehand.<br />cornflour is an option.<br />yep, you could&nbsp; leave a little gap.

				You could always get smaller sized pills, like a 2 or a 3. Some pills are pretty large like the 00. Errowid has a very handy pdf that shows the actual size and approx volume of each. I found it through Google with something like &#039;pill size comparison&#039;

				Just buy a milligram scale and measure out doses as such.<br /><br />It&#039;s okay if you leave a gap in the cap!

				I&#039;ve thought about this. It seems like measuring out powder for the individual pills would be a time-consuming pain in the ass. The only way I&#039;ve thought of to get around it would be-- well, have you seen how sort of primitive, a couple-hundred-at-a-time capsule fillers work, where it&#039;s filling one-half of the capsule to the top and then capping? I figure, you calculate the volume of that capsule half, figure out the volume of the dosage you&#039;re going for in pure powder, then cut it with starch or sugar or whatever so that the right dosage fills the half-cap. For example, if the half-cap is 1.5 ml and the volume of the ideal dosage is .5 ml, you add enough sugar/whatever to fill the other 1 ml. <br />That way you don&#039;t have to measure for each pill. Hopefully that makes some sort of sense.

				Pretty sure there&#039;s a product that automatically caps pills(Definitely a market for it). Kinda like one of those joint rollers but for pills, and it&#039;s not too expensive.<br /><br />I&#039;m too stoned, but google automatic pill capper or some shit, it exists and not that expensive

				I just purchased a pill filler machine, it was pretty in expensive and I can fill as many as I need to as long as you are filling them up. I use Cap M&#039; Quik model(it&#039;ll do sizes &quot;0&quot; and &quot;00&quot;) but there are all sizes and different brands. Disregard this if you have these just trying to help.

				I guess I&#039;ll try some of the smaller pills and see if maybe the volume of that ends up being a normal dose. That would be convenient...

				gelatin capsules are fine; a gap does nothing, unless you are selling and are afraid buyers will think the gap indicates less product.<br /><br />also depends how many capsules you want to fill. if not many, just use a straw cut at an angle, or even a needle point cylinder. <br /><br />pill filling machines are out there, but the cheaper ones tend to do a sloppy job, especially if using very small capsules.

				Make sure it is powdered pill and not pure alprazolam.<br /><br />I have never heard of broken up pills being sold but that makes sense. Figure out what a whole pill weight and what its dose is then you know how much pill powder to take.<br /><br />If however it is pure alprazolam, which is by far the cheapest way to get it, then it is too potent to eyeball. In that case you should dissolve it into everclear using volumetric measurement.

				I&#039;ve used regular vitamins for pill capsules. I was ingesting nutmeg at the time. (In case anyone didn&#039;t know, it&#039;s a legit way to trip, if you buy the right kind. First heard of it in the appendix of Naked Lunch where William S. Burroughs lists all the drugs he&#039;s taken and their effects).
