				Just wanting to hear anyone&#039;s stories of packages being seized by postal service.<br /><br />From what I understand if this happens at all costs do not accept the package and deny ever expecting, or any kind of knowledge the package is tied to you.<br /><br />This is obviously my number one concern with this whole system. I do not want to put my life down the drain over a purchase of weed, which should be legal in the first place.<br /><br />And that&#039;s a question I keep on asking here. People who have had weed shipped to them, have these transactions been legit? Have you had qp size orders shipped to you, and are they successful?<br /><br />Frrom the vendors I have been looking at it the reviews make it sound like there is absolutely no risk, but I don&#039;t believe that one bit and want to learn how to mitigate the risk.

				there&#039;s a search bar on the upper right hand of the forum.<br />if you write &#039;seized package&#039; or &#039;controlled delivery&#039;, you will find dozens of posts which describe exactly what you inquire about.<br />

				Thought I had to get to 50 before I can join other forums. <br /><br />I&#039;ve read them too. There&#039;s no reason not hear more is there? I feel the more information users can get the safer they can be. I want to be as safe as I possibly can be. At least tell me your understanding of the process if you don&#039;t a personal experience.

				I&#039;ve never had an intercepted package, but just want to share my perspective.<br /><br />Since the shipping itself is handled by the vendor, the only ways I can see you mitigating risk are in where the package is shipped and how you transmit your shipping information to the vendor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can mitigate the risk of communicating your address with pgp (which most vendors require anyway). In receiving larger packages of cannabis, it&#039;s also a good idea to have it delivered to an address you don&#039;t have anything illegal at, just in case. Some of the especially careful (or paranoid) leave the package unopened for a day or two, just to be safe. If you want really useful information, I&#039;d recommend the review threads for the specific vendors you&#039;re interested in. The reviews in those threads contain lots of useful bits of info, not limited to the quality of stealth shipping employed. Just my two cents.

				Well even though I am trying to learn to swim in the SR I really don&#039;t have anything illegal at my house. Not even smoking devices lol. I am one of those few who chooses to be sober but due to an affinity in meeting people have found providing weed to people to be a great way to help pay college tuition. And in past semesters all of my tuition and bills, but that was too much work.<br /><br />Why leave it unopened? Is this in case they come back and try to pull something similar to a CD?

				I know.<br /><br />I am not trying to annoy people. I need something to discuss, and this is what I want to discuss. I don&#039;t see any harm in talking about it. Increasing awareness and knowledge seem to be the most important factors when first coming to SR. <br /><br />I mean you literally need to spend a good 8 hours of straight reading imo before you make any moves with BTC and SR

				In Canada they routinely seize packages. They don&#039;t have as much security as we do in the states. There are contraband laws in Canada that allow search and seizure of mail through the post service. Seeds and weed are the most common, and what even funnier is that it is usually busted with the &quot;super discreet tshirt/mug&quot; method of shipping because of the logos. But usually after that they (RCMP/Customs) send people nice little letters saying that they have seized and then your address goes on a list.

If they come back and you haven&#039;t opened it, you can just be like yea I wasn&#039;t expecting any packages to I didn&#039;t open this suspicious package.
