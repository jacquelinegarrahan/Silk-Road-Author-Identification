				I just made a purchase with this vendor. His listing seemed slightly shady, and his price for suboxone pills was incredibly low. I checked his feedback, and it hasn&#039;t been updated in awhile until, like, two days ago. I&#039;m concerned because he has some bad feedback, and I really need my product by mid-week, end of week, hence why I payed extra for priority. I messaged the vendor twice, and he hasn&#039;t responded, it also say&#039;s he was on SR today, and yesterday. Has anyone bought from him legitimately recently? Any info on this vendor?<br /><br />Link to vendor page:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/416fa39fe7

				I am always looking at the suboxone listings, and I have seen that vendor..his feedback was more then enough to put me off..I need it by a certain time, and dont have time to fuck off with a vendor who may or may not ship it..<br />I have used seneca, he ships basically same day, have FE&#039;d for free shipping, which has ALWAYS shown on the 4th day because its first class.<br />I think he is out currently however..<br />I have also used PillfirePharmacy, they also ship it same day, priority or overnight..as long as you are in time for them to get to the PO.<br />And Wallstreetx2, best deal around on sub with overnight, or priority, another one who ships same day as long as you get it in to them by 4pm est. <br />Too late today, but you could have it by thursday with either of these vendors. <br /><br />There are a few with just excellent feedback, it is not worth trying to save a few bucks if you really need it to arrive in a few days. I have tried and been burned.<br />
