				So, after 9months of local searching, I turned to the Silk Road for the shot I need to do before putting the needle down... the FIREBALL.<br /><br />I am Rx&#039;ed 20mg of Oxymorphone IR (generic Opana IR) and 40mg of Methylphenidate IR (generic Ritalin). I IV them every single day. I also am Rx&#039;ed 1,050mg of Soma and 6mg of Klonopin a day. I do a &quot;Babyball&quot; every day as the Ritty is more like Coke than it is like Amps... providing a small rush when IV&#039;ed (imagine shitty Coke, without the cut causing side effects). I want to do a souped-up Speedball called a Fireball. It will be 15mg of OxyM, 30mg of Ritty, 200mg of acetone-washed fish-scale Coke, and 100mg of rock China White H.... all in one syringe. I plan to use my U-100 syringes for this... I know watering Coke down will cause the chances of a bell-ringer shot to decrease. But, the OxyM and the Ritty require a good amount of water to dissolve. How should I &quot;cook&quot; (&quot;cold cook&quot;, I know) this shot? Should I mix the H&amp;C and use 20 units of water to draw them up, then draw up 80 units of OxyM and Ritty... combine, shoot. Or, should I draw up 1cc of OxyM and Ritty, then, use 30units of this chemical infused water to draw up the H&amp;C, then shoot? Will I need vinegar (to make the solution acidic) at all since I&#039;m dealing with rock China and acetone-washed fish-scale? I spent all my money on this stuff... I *HAVE* to get a bell-ringer Fireball.<br /><br />Also, will taking Soma before blunt the Fireball (does it blunt Speedballs)? I know it potentiates my OxyM... but I don&#039;t want to sedate myself out of the Coke giving me a bell-ringer.<br /><br />I will let y&#039;all know how the shot goes, by the way...<br /><br />A Speedball had allowed me to experience the female orgasm. The Fireball will be what it was like when Mary got knocked up by God. Ha.<br /><br />Then, I hope to close a 5 year chapter of my life that found me with a needle hanging out of my arm daily... and resulted in the deaths of several people... including my fiance (hung herself in jail).<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				Anyone know if I get a needle registered in one vein with the Boy&amp;Girl and another with the OxyM&amp;Ritty in another vein and inject them back to back, will I get the same effect as having them combined?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy
