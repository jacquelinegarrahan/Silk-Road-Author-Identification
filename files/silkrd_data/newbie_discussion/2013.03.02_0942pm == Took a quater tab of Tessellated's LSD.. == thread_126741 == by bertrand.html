				...wanted to play it safe as it&#039;s supposed to be strong and new to all this.<br /><br />Took 9 hours ago. No visions of any kind. Just felt drowsy. And no, I&#039;m not on anything else. Perhaps it was too small a dosage but drowsiness?

				Then don&#039;t buy from them again... Have you tried to contact the vendor? If so and they don&#039;t respond make another attempt... If nothing else then slam the fuck out of them on their review forum. If you FE&#039;d then you might be popped...

				i don&#039;t know what he advertises, but the minimum dose for any effect at all would be around 50µg - but at that dose you certainly can&#039;t expect any visuals. <br />so your tab would have to be rated at around 200µg for anything to happen with a quarter - even if it is, <br />you would have to take into consideration possible degradation (lsd is very sensitive to light and air) <br />as well as very optimistic dose estimations on your dealers side (i don&#039;t know his reputation, so i don&#039;t want to insinuate anything)<br /><br />a standard tab of lsd as used back in the day was about 270µg, so you would definitely be safe with a whole tab of your stuff, <br />but if you really want to ease more carefully into it, maybe start with the 3/4 you have left.<br />also try to store your lsd in a cool &amp; dark place and if possible vacuum seal it - this way you can prevent further degradation

				@jägermeister<br /><br />Still doesn&#039;t explain the drowsiness. Maybe it was a coincidence. I&#039;ll take the rest of the tab (other three quarters) in a couple of days and see.<br /><br />@lemongrabber<br /><br />I finalized but I wouldn&#039;t be asking my money yet after taking such a small dose. I&#039;ll give him the benefit of the doubt for now. I contacted him anyway.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice.

				Wait you took just a piece off of one tab? That&#039;s probably why nothing happened, should have dropped the whole tab. I&#039;m still awaiting my first L exp and plan on getting from Tess soon, but if there&#039;s one thing the shrooms have taught me it&#039;s that you gotta go all the way or not at all.

				Definitely go with a full tab... maybe a half tab if you want to be extra cautious.. A lot of LSD is actually dosed lower than it is advertised at and a quarter of most tabs nowadays will have no effects.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to find tabs of LSD anymore than will get you feeling it from a quarter of a tab.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend taking half a tab if you&#039;re trying to be cautious, but really a full tab should suit you find.

				Go with one tab. Two might put you in over your head. Start slowly and work your way up over the course of a few trips. That&#039;s the best way to have positive experiences.

				Yeah, you gotta go all in before you&#039;ll know.&nbsp; At least one tab.<br /><br />That&#039;d be like saying you ate 1/4 mushroom cap and deciding they&#039;re bunk.&nbsp; Or a quarter of a beer and not being drunk.&nbsp; Pick a nice day, be outside and have a blast...

				if the rating of your tab is correct, you should be tripping<br />honestly, i don&#039;t think that there is that great of a variation in human metabolism for 200µg to not have an effect, unless of course you&#039;re on antidepressants or any sorts of meds which may cause an interaction...

Getting to know your reaction to the product was a very smart thing to do!<br /><br />I would recommend doing more research on the product (the Avengers, the LucyDrop, youtube, erowid, ... or some books) so that you know more about it and about what it could do to you (dosage&amp;effect). That would help if you ever do ingest a dose that brings much more than you were expecting...<br /><br />Enjoy your discoveries in Lala&#039;Land!&nbsp; ;D

I to have a few decades of LSD experience under my belt as well. Once upon a time I got caught up by LE with a half sheet that I sold at a festival, when I got my discovery back from the State my cid tested out at 95 ug and that was way better then Tess stuff. Dont get me wrong he has clean pure product but it just is not up to par with the stuff from the 80&#039;s or the 90&#039;s. I have shared his product with a few of my friends that have vast experience as well and they have said the same thing. I remember in my day one hit would have real strong visuals walls breathing ect. Just my two cents But he still has some of the best on the road through&nbsp; ;D

Getting to know your reaction to the product was a very smart thing to do!<br /><br />I would recommend doing more research on the product (the Avengers, the LucyDrop, youtube, erowid, ... or some books) so that you know more about it and about what it could do to you (dosage&amp;effect). That would help if you ever do ingest a dose that brings much more than you were expecting...<br /><br />Enjoy your discoveries in Lala&#039;Land!&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the good advice. But as I stated in later posts I took a whole one and still the same. I agree with OwsleyStanley25 that they&#039;re probably not as strong as advertized.<br /><br />@jägermeister I&#039;m not on anything else. I stated that already.

				a quarter tab isnt going to do much, Ive ordered Tess&#039;s tabs before and they are pretty legit,&nbsp; I took a tab myself and tripped pretty hard, I had two tabs of other stuff that was pretty lo quality but I still tripped nicely def gotta take atleast a full tab to have a great trip

				Took 1 tab, was equivalent to 2 of nearly every street LSD I have found (1 exception), would highly recommend, though I may personally try JC next time.
