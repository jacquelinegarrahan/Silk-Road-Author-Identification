				who attacks BTC? who is most affected by BTC? who is buying BTC, besides American druggies?<br /><br />what hacker doesn&#039;t claim props for their deviant acts? who is the best at keeping secrets and lying?<br /><br />who has the MOST to gain from destroying BTC? who has the economic resources to attack BTC?<br /><br />most importantly, who has FAILED at rocking the boat?<br /><br />BTC is backed by drug addicts. BTC will NEVER fail. Silk Road down? Black Market is UP. See how this works?<br /><br />TOR goes down: street violence goes up...

				You called it GMO Taster<br />How soon after this little thread was started did SR get the DDoS attack?<br /><br />The other bottomfeeders could do well to try and grasp your simple point. <br /><br />It&#039;s the 30 or so families that control the world. Look into the FED, and just exactly what that is. <br /><br />Some more known like Rothschild and Rockefeller to name a few, are your masters. They own Obama, like they own the Bush&#039;s, the Clintons, Tony Blair and the rest, are merely their employees. <br /><br />The trickle down economics, that seems to be leaving more crumbs than dollars, is totally whacked upside the head by this whole operation. They may eventually get SR, and hell even the BTC, but as long as we have a free internet. Free of censure, like is done in those wonderful Communist countries our leaders seem to love. (I wonder why?)<br /><br />Recent article from the International Business Times;<br /><br />&quot;Censor Internet Content&quot;<br />Latest Transparency Report Shows Rise In Government Efforts To Censor Content<br />April 25 2013 12:03 PM<br />According to Google’s latest transparency report that was released on Thursday, the government is putting more effort toward controlling content online than ever before.<br />“From July to December 2012, we received 2,285 government requests to remove 24,179 pieces of content — an increase from the 1,811 requests to remove 18,070 pieces of content that we received during the first half of 2012,” Susan Infantino, Google’s legal director, said on the company’s official blog.<br /><br />For the rest of the article, you wont find on MSN or CNN or Fox, copy + paste this link into your browser;<br /><br />http://www.ibtimes.com/google-transparency-report-governments-intensify-efforts-censor-internet-content-1217211#<br /><br />That&#039;s my good deed for the day. <br /><br />Now it&#039;s on to getting 50 posts on another screen name. <br /><br />14 month member<br /><br />Chip<br /><br />
