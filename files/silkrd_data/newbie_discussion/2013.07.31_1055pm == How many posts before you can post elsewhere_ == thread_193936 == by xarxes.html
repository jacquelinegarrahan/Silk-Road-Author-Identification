				I realize that the incentives are such that people will just post a lot of spam, but there&#039;s really no need to just type in random garbage.<br /><br />Think about it: there has never been a point in human history where anonymous people from all over the planet could join together and discuss anything they wanted, with essentially no barriers or restrictions.<br /><br />So consider starting a new topic and posing thoughtful questions (that don&#039;t reveal identifying details) for your comrades. You get one more post to 50, as do all the people responding, but you also might have an interesting discussion.
