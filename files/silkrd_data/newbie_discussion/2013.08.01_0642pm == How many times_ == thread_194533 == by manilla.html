				OK, was going to post a review to a vendor and have found out I cannot post anywhere but here. So...<br /><br />How many post must I make before I can take care of my vendors request??<br /><br />I know, I know.... read the FAQ&#039;s.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, I can&#039;t be the only one who wonders this AND I need to post here, so there it is.<br /><br />NOW I&#039;ll go look up the FAQ and get the number. Will repost that number to this thread (it counts, right?).

				Thanks. Guess it wasn&#039;t so obvious. <br /><br />The FAQ was a bit vague<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_can.27t_I_post_in_the_forum.3F

				OK, I understand the motivation for having newbies post 50 times. Trying to build community, right?<br /><br />Really appreciate the tip on random post to the &quot;50&quot; thread. Think I&#039;ll just troll around the other threads and politely make 50 comments. Who knows, maybe I&#039;ll run into someone interesting? Maybe the guy in the next cubicle riding the road as well? You never really know, do you?<br /><br />Be seeing you my fellow enthusiast.

				Please dont spam anywhere but the spam titled threads..it&#039;s annoying and word on the grapevine is -karma is gonna start being the barely punishable result.&nbsp; <br />Member enforced from the grumblings of the few hero members that actually try to help the newbies that want to learn how the system works before going out into the main forum where they no doubt will be scammed because they didnt take a few days to learn from the more experienced members.<br /><br />Just a messenger.

				East India Traitor<br /><br />Thanks for the message. Clearly, I&#039;m a newbie and that very much helps to understand the culture. This thread has been very helpful to me and hopefully might be to someone else in my situation (newbie). I&#039;ll try to keep my comments pertinent. I assume that&#039;s what you are describing as &quot;spam&quot;, right? Meaningless comments?<br /><br />I&#039;d rather read threads and try and add to the conversation vs. mindlessly adding to spam threads. Compelled participation, perhaps, but preferred no doubt.

				Don&#039;t spam to get to your fifty that&#039;s the easy way out, just surf the newbie section and reply with your opinion and experiences and knowledge of SR and you&#039;ll get there in no time if you active.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
