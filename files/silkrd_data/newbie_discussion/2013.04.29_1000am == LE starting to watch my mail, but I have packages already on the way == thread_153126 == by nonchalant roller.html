				Hello, an acquaintance of mine was recently (Sunday) arrested for a multitude of things and decided to inform the police of my use of the silk road. So I think that it is safe to say that they will be watching all of my mail from now on. Unfortunately, I have an order that shipped Friday from the UK to the US, am I fucked? Is there any way that I can get out of this?

				I agree with samesamebutdifferent. I would discreetly clean out your house. When you receive this package, leave it unopened for a while - maybe a day or two. If they are going to raid you, I suspect it will be within hours. If you do get raided, don&#039;t say anything - just ask for an attorney. And when I say don&#039;t say anything, I mean don&#039;t say ANYTHING except I want a lawyer. They will&nbsp; try to trick you into talking - make you think it&#039;s just casual conversation, make you think if you tell them what they want to hear that they will go away. Don&#039;t be fooled!<br /><br />BTW, how do you know your &quot;friend&quot; talked?

				I concur, say nothing.<br /><br />Anyone can send anything to anyone through the mail - after all, who&#039;s to say you&#039;re friend didn&#039;t send the package to you to bring the heat down on you ...?

				Go to USPS.com and put a 14-28 day hold on your mail. Clean your house and leave for a few weeks. After the hold is over all of your mail will be delivered at once. <br /><br />It would be pretty hard to perform a controlled delivery if they&#039;re simultaneously delivering weeks worth of undelivered mail. <br /><br />Then you have an alibi. &quot;If I was having shit sent here, then why did I give you gentleman two weeks to get warrants and riffle through my mail at the post office?&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Better yet if your friend is out on bail and it&#039;s possible for him to access a computer, register a USPS.com account and put a hold on your mail from an open wifi connection near his house, or his own wifi connection if possible and put a hold on your mail and create an account with fake information. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s a possible misdemeanor/felony to misuse the feature.<br /><br />Then all you would have to argue is that someone is trying to set you up.<br /><br />Hell if its a small order and you think you&#039;re going to get busted and it arrives, call the police and report it. <br /><br />(personally I think this is a bit much, but I like exercises in strategy)

				the only correct answer is to say nothing, zero, zilch other than a name, bday, and I want to speak with a lawyer.&nbsp; don&#039;t try to lie, blame anyone, or anything of the sort cause it only takes one little fuck up for them to nail you with obstruction, lying etc.&nbsp;
