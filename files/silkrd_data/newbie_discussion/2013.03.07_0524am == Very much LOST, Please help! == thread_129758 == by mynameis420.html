				Hey 420....<br />I&#039;m pretty new too but I have made 2 deposits so far using bitfloor.com. Its easy, just sign up for an account through Tor. Java has to be enabled. Once you have your accout sign in and go to the Deposit tab and punch in the amount you want to deposit. It will spit out instruction including a unique deposit amount. Then you just need a Bank of America location to make a cash deposit. You don&#039;t need ID just the info they give you...fill out a deposit slip and hand it to the cashier with your cash...by the time you get home your money should be in your account and you can then trade it for bitcoin and send it to SR or your wallet. Viola! Your purchasing shit anonymously on Silk Road...<br /><br />Happy Trading!

				it took me a while to figure this process as well, but i find the easiest method is to make a mtgox account and go to&nbsp; bitinstant.com and choose cash deposit ---&gt; Mtgox, then just follow the instructions (pretty self explanitory) and then i just go to your local cvs with the specified amount of money and make a moneygram transaction, and tell moneygram you need to pay a bill, and dont worry if you have a smartphone you can have all the info you will need (codes, account numbers) emailed to you so you can have it in front of you while you make the moneygram. which all CVS have now, its usually a little red phone. follow the instructions and answer their questions then go tell the cashier you need to pay for a moneygram. the cashier will look it up on the computer and the whole process in cvs only takes 5 to 10 mins. then go back home and go to mtgox and log in, all of your funds should show up in your account pretty much instantly. then on mtgox under &quot;trade&quot; tab you have to buy your bitcoins. once you have done that you can then go to &quot;funding options&quot; on mtgox and then click on &quot;withdraw funds&quot; enter the amount of bitcoins you wish to withdraw from your mtgox account and where it says &quot;enter bitcoin address&quot; copy and paste your&nbsp; address that is listed when you view your account on SR. it may take some time for them to show up on SR but i have never had this method fail me. i know this probably sounds complicated but i find that it is the easiest way to obtain BC. good luck!
