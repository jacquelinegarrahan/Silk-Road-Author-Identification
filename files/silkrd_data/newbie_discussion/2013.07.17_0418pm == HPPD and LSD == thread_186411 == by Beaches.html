				I have not tried LSD yet but I am very curious. I was going to buy some but the vendor is out of stock at the moment. While I was reading more about it I came across something called HPPD. In short, this is like visuals remaining long after the trip has finished, except you know they aren&#039;t reality. I read severe cases where you must visit a doctor occur only 1%-5% of the time in first time users (usually people prone to it in their genetics or something) but there are suspected many more cases where the person does not seek help. I also read about an experiment involving regular people, LSD users, and people who used LSD and have HPPD and there are certain vision aspects that worsen down the line. Such as the ability to tell if a light is flickering or constant (like a strobe light). Regular people could tell it was still flickering while at a very high speed, LSD users in the middle, and HPPD patients the worst. LSD is supposedly not harmful physically unless you do something to yourself while tripping so what I&#039;m trying to determine is why the LSD users would be any less than the regular people. Potential damage to eyesight plus possibility of HPPD (which would drive me absolutely insane) are making me have reserves about trying LSD despite the fact that I&#039;m still very curious. Is there any real risk of developing long lasting changes like these?

				I know nothing about HPPD but I will say that if you are remotely worried about taking LSD you aren&#039;t in the right mind frame to take it.
