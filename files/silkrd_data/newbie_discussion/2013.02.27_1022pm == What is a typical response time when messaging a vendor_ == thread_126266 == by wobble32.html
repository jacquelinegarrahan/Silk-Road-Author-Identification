				What is typical for a response time when messaging a vendor? I was really trying to buy something, but vendor hasn&#039;t responded and its been over a week. Sent 2 messages. Vendor also has no review thread but great feedback. Should I just order a tiny amount even though there is zero communication? I wonder if it&#039;s because I haven&#039;t bought anything yet :(&nbsp; Do some vendors just refuse to communicate until I have a buying history?

				I&#039;m not 100%, because I&#039;ve only made about a dozen purchases thus far, but I&#039;ve gotten responses from every vendor I&#039;ve purchased from within two days. I don&#039;t recommend you purchase from someone who won&#039;t message you in a couple of days, because if they won&#039;t message you back promptly before buy from them, they likely won&#039;t be different after you have already placed an order and are waiting for your package to arrive. Also, from what I&#039;ve read, good reviews mean very little, without feedback from the community, because a person could just create dummy accounts to give themselves good reviews, if they had the time and funds available to do so. There have been a few scammers that have been exposed and banned from what I&#039;ve read, for doing this. I&#039;m not saying the guy you are messaging is a scammer, he could just be going through some personal stuff, or is having an off couple of days. That being said, its just good practice to be safe, to only purchase from vendors that don&#039;t require FE, and to find vendors that have been vouched for by longstanding forum members. <br /><br />Just my shiny two.... Hope it helps. :-)<br /><br />Anasterion

				I recently made my first transaction, and the vendor always got back to me in less than six hours. Of course, that was *after* I had made the purchase. I&#039;m a newbie here too, so I&#039;m just guessing, but I&#039;d be reluctant to deal with a vendor who doesn&#039;t answer a question from a prospective customer in a week.

				I&#039;ve only ever messaged one seller on the Silk Road, and he replied in about an hour and a half. I&#039;d steer clear of anyone who isn&#039;t responding to messages. I always find that good communication is a useful indicator of how professional a vendor is (at least on other markets such as Amazon and eBay).

				Word to both responses. I am very reluctant for that exact same reason. I also don&#039;t want to over message someone and get annoying. One thing though, theres not a lot of vendors offering what I am interested in, no other vendors offer it in the form this vendor sells it in, and his prices are a lot better. <br /><br />Ranxerox, that is kind of what I&#039;m wondering. If I need to actually make a purchase to get his attention. <br /><br />Anasterion, you are right that lack/delay of communication could easily indicate poor business practice, but to be honest if it is the real deal I am patient.<br /><br />Its sad, but I will probably have to give up on him...<br />I guess its been cool to watch my BTC get more valuable while I wait :D<br /><br />

				Are you using encryption? If not maybe try and encrypt your message. See if the vendor responds then. Also read his profile page to see if your answer is there. <br /><br />If he still doesn&#039;t respond then move on and find a different vendor. I don&#039;t recommend placing an order with a vendor you are not comfortable with.

				My first message was GPG encrypted, he posts a public key in his profile. I also tested out my encryption with a friend before ever trying it with a vendor. I didn&#039;t want to seem like a noob if I messed it up :D Then after a few days I was wondering maybe he only wanted personal information encrypted, so I messaged him just using SR msg system. My question was of a general nature, its not specifically addressed, but mostly i just wanted to see if/how quick he would respond. <br /><br />One reason I would prefer this vendor over others, is that I would be able to store his product for years potentially. Other vendors sell something which would be alot more difficult to store long term.<br /><br />He does offer sample size purchases. So I am still tempted to order one. <br /><br />If I was going to be totally safe, I would move on to another vendor. I will try a follow up email but I do not expect anything at this point.

				If the vendor you&#039;re refering to is EnterTheMatrix, then I&#039;m afriad he&#039;s gone rogue.&nbsp; Lots of people, myself included, were having a similar problem.<br /><br />Please god tell me, EnterTheMatrix or not, that you didn&#039;t FE.&nbsp; At least then you can get your BTC back...

				Isn&#039;t him, and I never actually ordered, so no FE. I&#039;ve decided to go another route i think.

				Assuming to problems with the site being overloaded, 24 hours is the most I would expect. Anymore than that, find another vendor.
