				So I bought a couple Oxycontin off of Liston, even though I read about him using fake xanax&#039;s, but his feedback on the oxy&#039;s made them look legit. I assumed they were Oxycontin Original formula even though there is no description.<br /><br />Anyways heres my experience..<br /><br />I Recieved the item and decided to share a oc 40 with my girlfriend. We split it in half and snorted it.. I felt really foggy headed and had a weird high. It felt nothing similiar to any percocets or oxy&#039;s ive done before. I went ahead and took another half a 40 by myself so at this point ive taken 40 mg total. I had a few beers and went to bed. Now ive literally drank on pills before and ive had my fair share of really bad hangovers but I woke up with the most massive migraine crippling headache I got off my bed and staggered around extremely dizzy I made my way to the bathroom, projectile vomiting, shitting my pants the whole 9 yards. <br /><br />I never felt so nausious my entire life and im certain it was the pills, and no it has nothing to do with tolerance and I didn&#039;t drink alot. These pills are absolutely bunk and fucking poisonous. I don&#039;t know if these are meant to be fake and sold to people or what the fuck they are supposed to be but they are not oxycontin. My gf couldnt move and we contemplated going to the hospital and we are not first time drug users I have never considered that. I wouldnt sell these to the worst piece of shit junkie in my neighborhood and I couldnt give them away if I tried.<br /><br />Im gonna take the loss on the chin and toss these in the garbage I just wanted to warn everybody.<br />

				Thanks for the warning. I don&#039;t know who to buy from anymore...<br /><br />I ended up buying a regent testing kit on ebay because I&#039;m worried about getting fake shit. You should invest in one too. They&#039;re very inexpensive and can provide great peace of mind.

				If it makes you feel any better, I purchased over 100 oxycodone 30mg from &quot;freegenerics&quot; as did a lot of other people and they were all fake. They came in blister packs and look legit, but it&#039;s nothing more than chalk.<br /><br />Sucks.

				No problem. There does appear to be a little (very little) oxy or some opiate present but I can&#039;t tell for sure. I plan on purchasing a reagent test and testing a few of the pills.<br /><br />As I said in another thread, I&#039;ll update or make a new thread once I do so. I know there&#039;s multiple people who got boned from him.

				I bought from him too.<br />They never gave me any bad experience and did make me nod from chewing them&nbsp; it took 2 x 40 so they seem pretty weak as I have no high tolerance to oxys.<br />Won&#039;t be buying anymore from him though.

				That sounds awful, man, glad youre feeling better. Thanks for posting your experience.&nbsp; I was looking at those, the fact that most of his listings are marked coming from UK and and some others are coming from US made me think something might be sketchy.&nbsp;

				If your in the US and you want oxy&#039;s, ya just gotta give up on oxycontin and get some Roxi 30 IR&#039;s. They are the same drug as the good oldschool oxy&#039;s, the OC&#039;s , they&#039;re all oxycodone ,.

				<br />Yes thanks for the heads up! +1 to ya. I was looking at buying from him as domestic oxy has really dried up.<br /><br />There might have been some weak Morphine in them. That always gives me terrible headaches in the AM after taking them.<br /><br />I bought some 10&#039;s from caligirl when she had them. Got one in my mouth now actually. I am still undecided on the quality though. It could be that 10&#039;s are just to weak for me as I take 40mg&#039;s of Oxycontin ER 3x daily.

I chew the 10&#039;s after I take a 40. So really its 50.

				I just want to back up the OP - and say I ordered from&nbsp; listonishere i got 10 OC&#039;s shipped from the US.&nbsp; After almost 10 days, from &quot;in transit&quot; he shipped them.&nbsp; They showed up, and they are the worst fakes i&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve put the transaction in resolution.&nbsp; Hopefully the admins take care of this and get my cash back.<br /><br />But more importantly - this dude is going to get someone hurt.<br /><br />

Thats why we all chewed, sniffed , shot or did whatever to the old OC&#039;s so all the drug would release instantly instead of time released like they were designed for. Roxi 30&#039;s are nice.... Since they are IR&#039;s, all you really have to do is swallow them . I still snort 1 or 2 when I have them just because I like to but it&#039;s really not necessary . They taste freakin nasty to sniff too.

It tests a multitude of drugs and the colors range through the whole spectrum so there should be no confusion. For instance, if you have oxy and you test it, the test should turn a pale violet for the &#039;Marquis Test&#039;.<br /><br />Just keep in mind there are a couple different kinds of tests. I recommend the Marquis like I was saying above and since the information you get sent isn&#039;t great, look up the color chart on google and there will be a list of all the drugs available to test and what colors they should be when tested.<br /><br />Hopefully that made sense...
