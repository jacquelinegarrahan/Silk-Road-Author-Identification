				If BC value is half it was when I purchased, and the item is still in processing, will the seller still honor the purchase?&nbsp; Or do they adjust the amount of BC owed?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case.. I assume I can just cancel the order?

				It depends on the seller. Many sellers will cancel sales that have not been shipped as they could stand to lose a fair amount. I personally am a small time seller, and have shipped all orders that came if before/during/after the crash. In fact i have to orders on me now that i will be shipping this morning in the expectation that they reach the buyer by Monday.<br /><br />I do however have several thousand dollars of coins that are either in ESCROW or on orders that have not been shipped. I am not confident that they will be shipped. I know one seller was offering preorders on Liquid Acid early in the week, he specifically stated that he would ship and you would be protected if the price crashed. It will be interesting to hear from anyone who bought from him on whether the acid was ever shipped.<br /><br />Not sure i answered your question, but there it is.<br /><br />I am more interested in whether people will continue selling on SR whilst MT Gox is in a trading halt. Gonna be an interesting few weeks me thinks.<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya

				There is a good possibility you will get screwed. The protection for buyers on the road really isn&#039;t that great.
