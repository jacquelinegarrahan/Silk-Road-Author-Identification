				What prevents a vendor/seller from using a fake address with the right zip code to &#039;prove&#039; (via DCN) they sent their product to the buyer?<br /><br />For instance, let&#039;s say I live in New York City, zip code 10001. I order a product from a vendor and supply my address as:<br />&lt;my real name&gt;<br />123 Main Street<br />New York, NY 10001<br /><br />The seller goes to Google and types, for example, &quot;10001 accountant&quot;. This results in any number of legitimate addresses with the correct zip code such as:<br />&lt;accounting firm name&gt;<br />&lt;number&gt; 5th Ave, <br />New York, NY 10001<br /><br />The seller can then just add my name to the fake address and since it is no signature required, the package is very likely reported as delivered via DCN by USPS. Maybe a few parcels are delivered to an actual person... and maybe that person says &#039;that isn&#039;t me&#039; which would just result in the package trying to be returned to an illegitimate return address.<br /><br />When this goes to resolution with SR, the vendor sends the USPS tracking number that shows &#039;delivered&#039; with the correct zip code, but no actual mailing address.<br /><br />Add to this that the vendor may have excellent feedback and be able to show that other buyers have received their package(s) recently. In other words, the vendor does this only once in a while and/or selectively, otherwise SR becomes suspicious.<br /><br />Buyer has no recourse except to scour the SR forums (good luck with the search functions) and try to find other buyers who may have experienced the same scam.

				wount work long term, too many complaints would destroy the vendors profile. This kind of business is not viable long term.
