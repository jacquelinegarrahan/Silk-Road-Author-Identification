				&nbsp; &nbsp; Hey folks. Let me preface by saying I&#039;m an almost complete opium newb. I&#039;ve made 2 orders here on Sr from 2 venders. I won&#039;t mention names because I don&#039;t wanna talk shit when I don&#039;t know shit. So.. I got some opium a couple weeks ago and tried it for the first time. I was expecting a much more powerful experience, but I could tell it was at least real opium. I chased the dragon with foil, and the stuff slid and smoked just as I&#039;d read it would. Now, I just received 5 grams from a different vender, and the stuff is just not the same stuff. It looks and smells the part, but does not smoke or taste the same. The first stuff bubbled and rolled and smoked almost immediately when applying heat. This 2nd stuff was much harder, not smoking at all unless I broke it up into small crumbs after initially heating it. And it does not roll down the foil like it seems that it should. Honestly , it burns more like incense and tastes much harsher than the 1st stuff I tried. I have read about this red incense shit or whatever, and so now I&#039;m nervous. I mean, this stuff does nothing for me and is pretty awful to smoke. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What do all you guys think about this? I don&#039;t wanna mention the vender yet, but if that info helps, feel free to PM me and I&#039;ll tell you. I&#039;m pretty bummed out about this, as I spent over $200 and have no desire to even take one hit off this shit. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Welcome to opium. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that good.&nbsp; It taste like rubber and doesn&#039;t get you that high. Opium dens and addicts smoke the stuff steady from a pipe all day and night to get something off of it.<br /><br />If you took a gram of opium and divided it I to its active ingredients , you would have about a 100mg of morphine or so.&nbsp; The rest is assorted alkaloids some are not active at all.&nbsp; Then there is the season and freshness of it that is a factor.<br /><br />I would definaey spend the money on heroin or something more pure than opium.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s made up of mostly latex.&nbsp;

				Hmmm yea, I&#039;ve had opium that put me on my ass, and I&#039;ve had opium that didn&#039;t phase me at all.&nbsp; It all depends on the quality of the opium, but more often than not opium isn&#039;t all that strong.&nbsp; &nbsp;I find that even hydrocodone will get me a lot higher than the opium I&#039;ve seen lately, which I know to be 100% natural opium.&nbsp; like canuckboy said, it&#039;s mostly latex, plant resins and other inactive matter.&nbsp; i wouldn&#039;t personally recommend heroin because it seems like a tough habit to kick... what you may want to try is making a tea out of the opium that you have.&nbsp; basically you just heat up some water, dissolve the opium in it, and filter out all the black stuff that settles to the bottom.&nbsp; people have overdosed by drinking too much, so try a little at a time and build up from there.&nbsp; if it is opium, it will have a very bitter flavor.&nbsp; do you have a picture of it? maybe you could post it here:<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/<br /><br />
