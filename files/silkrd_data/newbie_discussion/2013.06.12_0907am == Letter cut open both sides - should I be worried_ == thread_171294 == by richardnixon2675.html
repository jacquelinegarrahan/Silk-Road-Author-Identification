				Hi I ordered molly from UK. Received today all fine however I noticed both sides of the envelope were slit open as if with a letter opener, however the molly was still inside??? <br /><br />The vendor I order from is really stealthy and it was triple vacuum sealed, however now I am paranoid that perhaps my address has now been flagged. Has anyone else had this happen to them?

				Thinking semi-logically I would think - &quot;Why would there but &quot;cuts&quot; on -both- sides?&quot;&nbsp; That seems kind of odd, in that if I would think for someone to investigate the contents they would only need to open it one time.&nbsp; Further more, to intentionally cut it two times increases the risk of the product falling out exponentially.&nbsp; Swaying on the paranoia/coincidence side (hey I&#039;m praying for you bro I promise!) it sounds possibly physically torn from shipment.&nbsp; How did the contents look logistically; Did it look possibly opened and repackaged?, Was the product consistent to prior consistency? Did it weigh correctly?&nbsp; Did anyone else know of the approximate arrival time/location - it could have been locally tampered with (pinched).&nbsp; In any case - whatever has happened can&#039;t be changed - but further reducing&nbsp; risk is a bonus - clean drop location temporarily,&nbsp; don&#039;t order, or switch drop occasion for a while, take an occasional back road and watch for cars following longer than normal (not trying to get you paranoid - but never hurts on occasion).&nbsp; Keep us posted, but at the same time take care of yourself, and don&#039;t let the stress overcome you - think clearly, your first instinct isn&#039;t always the most correct.&nbsp; Keep us posted &lt;/bow&gt;

				for safety switch addresses<br />but i doubt it was LE. they would never allow you to keep your drugs. i could see them confiscating your drugs and not sending you a letter or visiting you&nbsp; and then see what else comes to that address but to just let your have the drugs after they find them, i dont think that would work in court. they usually want to preserve evidence.

				You&#039;ll be fine dude, please wont do a controlled delivery for a couple of G&#039;s and if it was opened they wouldn&#039;t have found anything because they WILL NOT willingly send drugs to you, unless they planned on a controlled delivery!
