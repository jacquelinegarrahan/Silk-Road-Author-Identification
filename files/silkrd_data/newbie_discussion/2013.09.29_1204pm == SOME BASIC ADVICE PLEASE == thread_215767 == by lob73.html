				Now im very new to this side of the internet now ive spent some to time trying to get my head round the security lingo associated with using SR. Now am setting up a sellers account in the coming weeks, but I am concerned about being safe and anonymous for obvious reasons. I have not yet used the site as i want to be confident that im taking the correct protocol to protect myself as much as possible. so as far as i have got to starting myself off please advise if im missing anything or have any further advise at this stage.<br /><br />obviously im using tor, i have also set up a e-mail account with hushmail<br /><br />using PINGIT to purchase bitcoins. But by using my bank account this creates a link to me ??? but i move my bit coins to another bit wallet does this hide the link to my bank account???<br /><br />now if i understand right, in the wallets there is a function to send or receive funds there is a unique address&nbsp; and this is different for each transaction.<br /><br />now if anyone can make any comments on how a standard transaction works the steps the buyer and seller need to do do to make a safe secure transaction.<br /><br />any help or useful comments are welcome!! <br /><br />

				Yes, when you buy bitcoins via a bank transfer, those bitcoins are linked to your account, as well as all subsequent transactions - so, sending them to another wallet is absolutely futile. Bitcoins, like tor, are only anonymous if you use the technology in the correct way.<br /><br />The solution is to use tumblers. If you read the SR wiki, you will learn SR uses a tumbler to break the link between your bitcoins and drug purchases, but SR can do nothing about the link between your bank account and your SR wallet - you need to use 3rd-party tumblers for that.&nbsp; blockchain.info provides one, in the form of &quot;shared send&quot;, and I believe they only charge 0.5% commission. Another option is bitcoinfog, which provides a hidden service as well as a clearnet site, but charge 1-3% comission. Both tumblers introduce a delay of at least approximately 8 hours.

				Firstly are you running the latest beta version of the TBB?<br /><br />Secondly buying BTC linked to your bank account is not a good idea, think of it this way, you are using Tor to be anonymous on the internet so you can access SR but you are then linking yourself to the crypto currency you are going to use to buy illegal items on the dark web and have them shipped to you.<br /><br />You should acquire your btc anonymously, have you checked out localbitcoins? def worth a look.<br /><br />If you buy your coins in this way there is no need to worry about all the tumblers before transferring to your SR account, you have already broken any link between you and them.<br /><br />Hope that helps, ask away if you need to know more.
