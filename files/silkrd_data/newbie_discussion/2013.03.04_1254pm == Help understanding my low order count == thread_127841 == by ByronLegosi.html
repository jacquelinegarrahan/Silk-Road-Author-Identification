				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked around SR for a long time finding similar products to my own and other than the MDMA, which I&#039;m a reseller for<br />and have to add a middle-man commission, I&#039;m cheaper than pretty much everyone else. I also vend from the UK which is much easier<br />to get by customs on the way out than the US where a lot of my rivals are.<br /><br />Basically, what I&#039;m asking is, is my low order count just because I&#039;m new and when I get some finalized sales they&#039;ll come in quicker,<br />or is it my prices are still a bit too high? Or is there some other reason?<br /><br />Would love some advice from some long term members.<br /><br />Patience is OK if I just need to wait for my feedback to come in (which I know will be good as I&#039;m very honest and as quick as possible).<br />Just thought I&#039;d ask, as well as help get my post count up =D<br /><br />Regards,<br />BL

				here is a shot in the dark maybe its your creepy avatar? i&#039;m joking but its possibility just like any other product that has low sales but a superior or equal potent product its about networking and building a solid customer base as well as a rapid module base. in a sense you need to get people talking about it so they can share that information and promote your product

				Thanks powerndknowledge,<br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just the need for some patience and some word of mouth as it were.<br />I&#039;m sure my rep will soon become good as my comms are great my product is legit and cheap, my packaging is stealth<br />and I&#039;m generally just a nice guy. It&#039;s just such a big initial investment to setup that it&#039;s a tad worrying when interest is lower than expected!<br /><br />You&#039;re right though, I just need to try harder at getting a good name out there!<br /><br />thanks for the reply,<br />BL<br /><br />p.s. my original post got buried but I was serious. a free 100mg MST for the first person to successfully PM my name&#039;s reference! (It&#039;s ByronLugosi, the forum typo was in an injoke with my ex-associate)
