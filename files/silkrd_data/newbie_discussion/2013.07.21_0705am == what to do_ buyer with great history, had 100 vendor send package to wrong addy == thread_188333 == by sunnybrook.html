				So, looking for some advice on what to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m a buyer with a perfect history, ~20 orders, for a few thousand bucks worth of stuff for personal use.<br /><br />I made a small (~$200) purchase from a domestic vendor with a 100 rating and an equally clean history.&nbsp; But, somehow, they made a mistake on this one, and sent the package to an address in a different state... and are now accusing me of trying to scam them.<br /><br />So I should let it go to resolution?&nbsp; My primary concern there, is, I&#039;m reading a lot of vendor pages that say they won&#039;t do business with someone if they have a single auto-finalize for any reason.&nbsp; So if I were to let this one auto-finalize and go to SR resolution, is that an automatic ding on my buyer history, regardless of the outcome?&nbsp; That could jeopardize my status with future vendors?&nbsp; Because if that&#039;s the case, then I&#039;d rather just bite the bullet and finalize.<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				Don&#039;t let it auto finalize if you do thats it game over you need to hit the resolve button and deal with SR im not sure if they can see the addy you sent him but iassume they can until you finalize

				Demand a resend if you are still interested in the product and if they deny you that open a ticket and ask for a refund because it&#039;s a fuckup on the side of the vendor and not on yours.<br />Except if you gave them the wrong address, which I assume you did not.<br />Did you Finalize Early?

				Nah, I didn&#039;t FE.&nbsp; The vendor, understandably, doesn&#039;t offer resends or refunds.&nbsp; I definitely did not give them the address they sent it to--it was to a different city and state.<br /><br />Ok, so in re: opening a ticket for resolution, like I kinda mentioned above, I am worried that doing that would hurt my buyer record, and that future vendors would not be willing to do business with me?&nbsp; Because I had a ticket/resolution/autofinalize/whatever on my record?&nbsp; Is that way paranoid of me?<br /><br />I have seen a few vendor pages lately up that say they won&#039;t deal with anyone who has an auto-finalize for literally any reason.

However I cannot understand the vendor, if you really gave them the right address and they shipped it to a wrong one, how is that your fault? How are you trying to scam them? This is them scamming you.<br />I am not sure as to how it will influence your buying stats but I assume that as long as the money is in escrow, the SR support will simply delete the transaction and refund you your money.<br /><br />Hope this helps and stay positive.

				Yeah, the vendor hasn&#039;t been cooperative at all.&nbsp; The whole situation is pretty bizarre, as on the same day they messaged me demanding I finalize and accusing me being a scammer, I finalized on two other orders for more $.&nbsp; That said, the vendor does have a 100 rating, and an overall clean history.&nbsp; (Looking through their entire feedback history, it looks like this same thing happened to one other guy, whose said his package never arrived, and the vendor also accused of scamming.&nbsp; All other feedback is 5/5.)<br /><br />If the transaction is just deleted from the books, then that would totally be fine.&nbsp; Again, my primary concern is hurting my buyer record in any way, when it looks like vendors overall are getting understandably stricter about who they deal with.

While having a 100% Feedback can be intimidating and reassuring you should always keep your guard up. You never know when a vendor account might be sold or if a vendor decides to go rogue. I can&#039;t speak for everybody but I prefer finding a vendor who offers the drugs that I want, answers questions and makes a nice first impression but also doesn&#039;t have too many customers at the same time because this is when mistakes start to happen but the vendor just ignores them because he still has 100 other customers in line.<br />Unfortunately I can&#039;t really help you with the negative rep question. Your best chance is if cirrus or samebutdifferent take a look in here but as I said you definitely should get your money back as soon as possible and open the ticket before it auto finalizes.
