				My dumbass best friend ordered xanax bars from Liston supposed to be the Pfizer Brand with xanax on one side and a 2 on the other.My Wife gets those by prescription and the pills he got from Liston are thick and hard as fuck. He didn&#039;t believe he had been taken so when my Wife got home from work we compared them and they&#039;re are not at all the same.He thought he would get rich of the pills but you get what you pay for.

				Just cause they&#039;re generic doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re bunk. I always get generic amphetamine - ITS CHEAPER - same active component, same dose, pills pressed at the same pressure (b/c that will affect bio-availability).

When i compared them to pics on google images the ones &#039; bought were way more boxed than the one&#039;s in the pics. Also the raised part on the ends of mine were noticeably less raised. I sublingual my xanax and they usually dissolve under the tongue without any help other than a little saliva here and there. With these they wouldn&#039;t break down. I had ordered 30, and went to bed with my last two inside my pants on the floor and when i woke up they were gone. My wife did my laundry that morning. I ran downstairs thinking there&#039;s no way xanax would survive a run through the washing machine. Sure as shit i opened the dryer door and took out my pants, and pulled out the zipbag with the two bars and they were so intact you could still read xanax on one side and then the 2 on the other. That&#039;s when i knew for sure they weren&#039;t the real thing. Also, the 2 was slightly(but noticeably when compared to the google pics)higher or lower than the real xanax.

				Damn, I placed an order of 50 from liston on Friday. Item was marked in transit today after I sent him a message asking when my product would be shipped out. Response was the word &quot;soon&quot; and thats it. I&#039;m reading reviews of people saying shipping taking 20 odd days for domestic usa to usa. I&#039;m worried now if this was a bad purchase.

				They are not made by a pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; There are a whole lot of xanax bar presses in the underworld.&nbsp; ONAX is the MOST POPULAR press that I know of.&nbsp; Then the GG ones.&nbsp; Sometimes they use alprazolam and sometimes they don&#039;t.&nbsp; Sometimes they overdose them and sometimes they underdose them.&nbsp; It depends on the batch and who presses them.&nbsp; They are not made by the legitimate pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; If you want to call that fake then yes they are fake but they may contain alprazolam.

				I agree with most of the statements here, except for the one about these 2mg bars from listonishere being &quot;more potent&quot; they are very well made fakes. They do contain alprazolam or whatever benzo is in them. Unfortunately they dont break right, they dont taste right until the middle.&nbsp; He doesnt claim for them to be pfizer made, but they fact that they are stamped xanax means they should be from pfizer.&nbsp; I just dont like the trickery. There should be written somewhere that they are NOT pfizer made, therefore not pfizer quality.... They do the trick, sort of but they way that listonishere goes about selling them is not ok in my book.&nbsp;

				I have used caligirl once before and the product seemed ok. They were 10mg IR&#039;s and I am used to taking 40mg ER&#039;s so ik was hard to gauge potency .

Let me tell you though ive taken the old oxy&#039;s before and all brands of roxies and the new OP oxy&#039;s and these feel nothing like them. They literally gave me a headache immediately after i snorted it. It wasn&#039;t euphoric at all.. I gave one to 2 of my friends who are regular opiate users too and they both agree they are Bunk. To be honest with you I really wanted them to be real and I would of been a regular customer in fact I was gonna order 100 next so it really sucks they are fake. Theres something in them but its NOT oxycodone. Probably morphine or god knows what but it probably gave me brain damage. My fault for buying pills off the internet though. I&#039;ve seen junkies repeatedly buy fake coke off my friend before so that explains why people keep buying these.

				How does this guy have such a high rating with such shitty service and products? I ordered xanax from him a couple days ago and it&#039;s still processing. I&#039;m starting to hope it stays that way for 2 more days so i can just cancel it.

				He&#039;ll not get anymore of my money took a proper 20mg by chewing it nodded for about 6 hours and then fell asleep it was great.<br /><br />Took 60mg of Liston&#039;s couple weeks before&nbsp; felt something for a couple hours and then got a really bad headache I chewed never snorted no way could I take 60 mg of the one I took on Saturday I&#039;d be out cold.<br /><br />The favourite xanax I have ever taken are those bars I used to get them around 6 years ago from this fella that posted from Panama and I loved them , but because they are listons or I read somewhere that he might have another account on here can&#039;t remember the name I leave them alone. :&#039;(

				Yeah that guy is sketchy for sure. He used to sell his dodgy wares on topix a couple years back and people used to complain about his gear then too. His K is or was tiletamine from a number of resports iv&#039;e heard and his other meds are all generics - some are probably better than others.<br />Was surprised to see all his feedback on here cause I know for sure that what he sells is second rate

				When liston was new I bought 4-mmc from him.&nbsp; He shipped it registered mail (requiring a signature) without mentioning it and I stupidly signed for it but that worked out.&nbsp; Unfortunately the product was not 4-mmc.<br /><br />I went back to him a month ago and mentioned that the 4-mmc I bought from him wasn&#039;t 4-mmc.&nbsp; He responded that what he now offers really is 4-mmc unlike what he originally sent me.&nbsp; Then he tried to get me to buy it.&nbsp; wtf.&nbsp; He just admitted that he ripped me off (the stuff was crap).&nbsp; The kicker?&nbsp; The &quot;new&quot; stuff STILL isn&#039;t 4-mmc.

				Xanax might be fine not so much profit on them his Oxy 40&#039;s are $30 each roughly.<br /><br />There is something in them though as an earlier poster said probably morphine.<br /><br />I was looking through a vendors page the other day a good vendor and he was saying on his page no one wanted his morphine pills.

Does not get any better than her.<br /><br /><br />OK GUYS, why in the fuck would you send oxy&#039;s to a lab that takes 2-3 weeks for processing and costs $140?????<br />-- I have a marquis reagent testing kit which ALSO WORKS FOR OXYCODONE. You can easily buy one of these on ebay for $20 and free shipping... For marquis, you just have to chunk off a bit of the pill, put a few drops of the testing solution and according to the color chart, it should turn pale violet. I used this myself when I bought oxy last time and it was exactly a light purple color so I knew if it was legit. Even if it has SOME oxy in it and another substance, the colors will blend and you will not get the pale violet color. You can easily know if you&#039;ve been ripped off for $20 instead of $140 and wait 20 seconds instead of 2-3 weeks.<br /><br />I cannot believe some of the veterans of this bored would condone labwork over DIY testing if it yields the same results....

				damn i wish i read the forum before i bought from listonishere.&nbsp; he had a 5.0 feedback thats the reason i trusted it, but he does have great looking fake xanax, name brand, i knew as soon as i put it in my mouth they were fake, they taste like cardboard and have no bitter alprazolam taste they should have.&nbsp; I assume he will probably be doing it again on a new site now, so watch for his scam, i wouldnt even buy xanax 2 bars unless you know the seller
