				hey everyone.<br /><br />so i&#039;ve decided to use bitinstant to purchase my coins, cash deposit. after a bit of reading, i&#039;ve heard a few contradicting methods. some people like to use their real info for the moneygram, while others use fake information. i initially decided to use my real information, but now i&#039;m thinking that it may be a safer bet to use fake information, assuming of course that walmart DOES NOT check the authenticity of the fake name and address i provide. <br /><br />my plan is this: fill out the bitinstant form over tor using fake information, transfer to a blockchain wallet, move that through the fog, and then finally move it to the road. <br /><br />before i move forward, i need reassurance that walmart will not check the fake information i provide on the blue moneygram slip at anytime, and that they DO NOT require identification.<br /><br />in short, my questions are:<br /><br />1. Will Walmart check the authenticity of the fake name and address that I use on the Moneygram slip?<br />2. Is it likely that Walmart will ask for identification, and if I &quot;forgot it&quot;, will they refuse to serve me?<br /><br />thanks for reading, help is much appreciated!

				Moneygram policies are actually pretty clear. There are value amounts that have required levels of identification. As long as you stay below those amounts, you&#039;ll be fine. Like payday loans, I think these amounts are regulated in some places/states - so the value may be different than what I tell you. That being said, from the ones I&#039;ve used, anything over $900 requires an ID and a verifiable address. I&#039;ve used moneygram a LOT at walmarts around the country, and I&#039;ve never once been asked to provide ID. I don&#039;t normally do values more than around $250 for this exact purpose.<br /><br />Walmart and Moneygram both put this information very easy to find at the desk where you go to actually do the transaction. Its always on the moneygram form - read it carefully to understand what may constitute the requirement.

				Also this is important, and I&#039;m making another post for that reason...<br /><br />If you are using something like BitInstant, make sure you use the same name that you used at bitinstant. You don&#039;t need to use your name there either, but they MUST match. If you don&#039;t, there is no guarantee that you will receive your bitcoins. This is not a process that is actually performed by bitinstant - it is through an external company that they utilize to receive the cash.

				thank you for your quick response. knowing the official policy is exactly the kind of reassurance i needed.<br /><br />i won&#039;t be depositing very much, so i suppose i do not have to worry about identification.<br /><br />to clarify, you have deposited under fake name and address at walmarts across the country with absolutely no issue?<br /><br />any suggestions as to how i should choose my fake name and such? should i simply choose totally randomly (but insure that the address is reasonably close to the walmart)? i take it the fake name and address do not have to match up, as they will not attempt to authenticate it?
