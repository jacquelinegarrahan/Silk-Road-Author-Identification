				I&#039;m not a newbie to SR, but I am a newbie to IVing H. I need some advice. I watched a friend of mine do it a few times and he helped me as well but I just keep messing up on my own I feel like. I consistently end up with a tiny bump on my inner arm when I inject and it goes away within about 12 hours but does that mean I&#039;m missing the vein? I thought that might be it so today I tried on my wrist; that went even worse. I don&#039;t know what I did, if I blew the vein or missed or what, but I pulled the plunger back and saw blood so assumed I was in and injected. When I pulled the needle back, I realized I had done something wrong. My wrist immediately started to enlarge and it looked like the shot was pooling under my skin almost. I put a hot towel on there and then switched to ice and right now you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell there was a problem unless you looked at both wrists. The one I injected into is a little enlarged and very sore, but no bruising. Does anyone know what I may have done/ how to prevent this, and is this going to go away by itself as well? I really need some help learning to IV because the friend that was helping me isn&#039;t able to now.

				I can&#039;t say I can help as&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any experience with IVing and hope never to but don&#039;t try this again until you&#039;re sure about what you&#039;re doing!

				You missed in your wrist. You should always pull back on plunger about half way down to make sure you&#039;re still in the vein. At least till you are more experienced. Also if you take a second at the half way point you should feel the warm fuzzy feeling creeping through your veins if you hit your vein.

				Thank you. I understand I probably shouldn&#039;t be doing this until I know exactly what I&#039;m doing, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve now been kind of left on my own. I&#039;ve also tried smoking and it does absolutely nothing for me other than slightly irritate my asthma. Is doing a line of it going to be this weak too? I&#039;m starting to wonder if this is even worth it... I miss how easy it was to get a gel fent patch and nod the night away... any suggestions?

				When I got back into H I sniffed it for a while and at first the nods were just like banging it. Another option you can do is shoot it into a muscle. It just takes a little longer than a vein but not as long as snorting it. Maybe you don&#039;t have good veins to bang. I have that problem and I know it sounds crazy but some times I&#039;ll do some curls to get my blood flowing. In your spare time tie off above your elbow and just start feeling your arm for a possible vein. They will pop out eventually.

				Yes as the person above pointed out, you have what they call missed, It&#039;s nothing serious, will be gone in a few days, depending on size, you should of got a jolt of pain suddenly, which shows you your not in properly ( in the vein )&nbsp; you must of got one hit because you said it lasted 12 hours ( lucky fella you) When you go to try, don&#039;t use them small veins, try your main line archery, which is in the middle of your arm the underneath between the bicep and forearm. Or a leg on up top, never go in shallow veins. Look for it by practising first. make sure your belt string or whatever torniquet you use is pulled tight. Try and clench your fist to make veins pop up, then just go in lightly with new pin ( needle) and slowly carefully draw back on plunger, you should see blood, there should be no pain at all, period, save a&nbsp; sharp scratch at beginning, Make sure you cook up properly, and your filter is in ( little bits of undissolved heroin will block up pin.) making it impossible to administer. Please if you are going to I.V be careful, could you not stick to smoking? It&#039;s much more potent 100% stronger when you I.V. most people only choose I.V because of no money when the are dope sick, and they know smoking won&#039;t sort them out, so they inject. Please use clean pins and filters and citric acid, your local drug&nbsp; centre will give these out free. If you are missing , you will feel pain and a lump :&#039;( good luck!

				Yea sounds like you missed when you tried to hit on your wrist. When you shot it, did it burn as you were injecting? Thats one tell tale sign that you are missing the vein. It will burn slightly. Then you know to stop and retry hitting your vein. My best advice would be to stop injecting right away, before you get the hang of it. But that is coming from a recovering addict so I am a little biased. If you are going to continue IV&#039;ing, this is the 2nd best advice I can offer you. Tie off. Use a belt or a string or something to tie off above the elbow. Pump your arm a few times until your veins start to pop. Now take the needle and enter the vein at the closest angle to perpendicular to your arm as you can. This prevents you from pushing the needle into your vein and then THROUGH the other side. This is a common problem especially if you&#039;re using a longer point. Now once you think you&#039;re in, pull back the plunger to verify. If you see blood, then bingo. You&#039;re in. Push the plunger in slowly and make sure you don&#039;t feel any burn. If you do then you came out of the vein and you need to readjust. If you feel no burn then continue pushing the plunger until about 1/2 of the shot has been injected. Now stop and pull back on the plunger again just to double check that you&#039;re still in. If you are, then go ahead and inject the rest. A small little bump (sort of like a mosquito bite) is normal after a shot, as this is just from the needle poking you. Hope this helps.

				Mate , I forgot to add, don&#039;t go near them small wrist veins. They are too shallow, go on Google look for anatomy chart.&nbsp; Main archerys are in legs groin neck, aviod them at all costs,&nbsp; if you hit archery the blood will be pink, pull out and see medical advice.. Look for one in your arm&nbsp; when your in a normal vein the blood is dark red. You will know if you&#039;re not in vein , it will hurt you. Keep pulling back and just push a tiny bit in keep checking you&#039;re still in, by pulling and pushing slightly. I reread that, and realized you haven&#039;t had a hit so ignore the 12 hour comment. be careful.
