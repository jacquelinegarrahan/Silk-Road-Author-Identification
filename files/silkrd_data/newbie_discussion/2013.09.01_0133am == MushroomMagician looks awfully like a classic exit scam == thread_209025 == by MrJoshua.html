First, he dropped all the prices by 50% and added a ton of new products overnight, all half price of course, and with bigger amounts for sale. <br /><br />He changed his listings to worldwide.<br /><br />He says you don&#039;t have to FE, but look at his shipping. If you don&#039;t select FE, he forces you to sign for your package. <br /><br />Everything about the listings scream exit scam. <br /><br />I would not FE for this vendor under any circumstance.

				It just screams scam.&nbsp; Just look at some of the quantities listed.&nbsp; For his ounce listings, he supposedly has 58 ounces available when you add to cart...&nbsp; Then his half pound listing has 19 available, so with just those two listings he has over 12.5 pounds of product?&nbsp; I am a vendor, and I grow a lot, but never have this kind of quantity available, and it would be impossible to turn any profit at his price.&nbsp; Those prices would not even cover labor and energy costs.&nbsp; Something is awry.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Never been a fan of the idea of Social Darwinism, but SR seems to embody it sometimes.&nbsp; Both buyers and sellers can approach a 100% likelihood of being burned through lack of caution.&nbsp; Posts like this are exactly how such situations are avoided.&nbsp; Then again, the occasional burn is how most of us learned not to touch the stove.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s an idea I think might have merit - what about the ability on the part of the buyer to signify that a given order was FE&#039;d and, in turn, a stat kept about the vendor showing the percentage of FE&#039;s over time?&nbsp; This stat alone (particularly a recent spike) could raise a red flag for many of us.&nbsp; There could, of course, be a reasonable explanation - but, then again, the same could be said for a few troll reviews ruining traditional stats.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to point out why- or how- FE&#039;s are a bad idea (...as that&#039;s been covered) but they&#039;re a necessary evil in some circumstances.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t it be tracked as such?

				I placed an escrow order; we&#039;ll see what happens.&nbsp; The FE or signature is only for the large listing per MM, &quot;We just have one listing that requires a signature and that is the quarter pound mushrooms listing. Everything else is no signature. Thanks&quot;&nbsp; I messaged him and it took only a couple minutes to get a reply so he&#039;s either doing his job, or counting his free money; here&#039;s to the former!

				I guess he must have changed the listings up then, because earlier, you had to sign for all of his listings if you did not FE.&nbsp; Also, he charges more for shipping than he actually should.&nbsp; $10.00 for priority is a rip off, yet another reason why people might use the FE option.&nbsp; He is getting extra money on the back end of the sell, just like people try to do on ebay.&nbsp; I will not order from people like that as a matter of general principle.&nbsp; Like I do not know what it cost to mail items or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed that he has significantly changed his quantities as well after I called him out on it.&nbsp;

				So many&nbsp; screaming NO FE.&nbsp; But does anybody realize you almost cannot buy at all, until you have stats.&nbsp; Can&#039;t get stats without vendors stopping demanding FE.&nbsp; We go through all the set up work, vetting, reading, reading, F-ing getting BC in our account.&nbsp; Then when it is due to be shipped the pn comes &quot;FE now I send&quot;&nbsp; it&#039;s bullshit blackmailing, trap you in a box way to get you to FE.&nbsp; The the road says &quot;oh, you FE-ed.&nbsp; No nothing from us, dummy.&nbsp; KetamineOcean got quite a few of us that way.&nbsp; The Road is duplicitous.&nbsp; Openly allowing for FE and subsequent scams, mostly on &quot;newbbies&quot; who have little choice if they wanna play ball,&nbsp; then saying &quot;We out, dummy&quot;.&nbsp; We know our position&nbsp; we need non-judge-mental guidance.&nbsp; And support from the road in the form of contingency,&nbsp; you demand FE-warning, do it 2 x more times 2 month suspension for Vending Rites.&nbsp; Getting worse too.

				It looks like I might have been scammed.&nbsp; How do we resolve this?&nbsp; I am sort of a noob and fell to his FE trick TWICE!&nbsp; I thought these deals would run out soon and he had good reviews when I ordered, so I placed 2 orders.&nbsp; I feel stupid, but how do we fix this?&nbsp; Is all my money for sure gone now?&nbsp; I thought the Silk Road doesnt let people scam.&nbsp; God I am upset.
