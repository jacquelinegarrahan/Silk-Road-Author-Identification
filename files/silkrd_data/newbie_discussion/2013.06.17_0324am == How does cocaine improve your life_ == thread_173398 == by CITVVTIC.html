				I know cola has done great things for some. Didn&#039;t Freud write Intrepretation of Dreams while on a cola binge? I myself have only used it for recreational purposes. If I needed something stimulating to help get shit done I always used amps.

				I want to thank all three of you with positive karma for fostering an honest and productive discussion on cocaine.<br /><br />I get so tired of the non-drug world (the same ones that will get drunk but think any other form of drug use is wrong) looking down on something like cocaine. Its refreshing to me to see people that have actually been benefited through its use.<br /><br />+1 to all three of you.

				In small doses it could relieve depression, boost confidence, and boost motivation. However, there&#039;s always side effects to every drug. <br /><br />...and if it&#039;s just for recreational use; it does feel really great :)

				I&#039;ve never tried it before either, but I just thought sticking to psychedelics is safer.

				cocaine is fun but it will bring no value or improvement to the quality of your life unless you are selling it. moderation is key. mental addiction is just a word used by people who refuse to take responsibility for their own actions.
