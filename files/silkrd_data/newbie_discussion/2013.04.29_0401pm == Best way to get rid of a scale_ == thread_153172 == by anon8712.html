				The topic title is pretty self explanatory. I&#039;ve become quite paranoid recently. I am a pretty new smoker, only been smoking for about three months now, and when I first started out I bought a scale because it seemed like the smart thing to do. I could weigh up my stuff and know if a seller was awesome and packing my stuff fat, if he was trustworthy and the stuff was weighing up exactly, or if he was trying to cheat me and my stuff weighed up short. The more people I encountered though often tell me getting caught with a scale is a big no no if I were to ever get caught for some reason. So what&#039;s the best way to get rid of it? I know wiping it with an alcohol pad will get rid of any residue but what about fingerprints? <br /><br />Also, I recently bought this stealth stash product where it&#039;s an energy can that opens up and comes with a grinder and a scale. I&#039;m thinking this would be a smarter option for me. My only concern is that it&#039;s some no name energy drink company I&#039;ve never heard of so it may stick out a little bit more than I would want. Thoughts?

				PS if you have scales, just put them near some jewelery, broken pieces of gold or silver. After all they are jewelery scales. Just dont have any coke or heroin residue on them. If you do then you are sloppy and need a smack across the head.

If you are worried more about paraphernalia than your drugs, then I think you are probably a very safe person to get high with.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153172.msg1063545#msg1063545">Quote from: underbelly on April 29, 2013, 04:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PS if you have scales, just put them near some jewelery, broken pieces of gold or silver.

				Sorry, to answer your question: <br /><br />1) give it to a stoner friend<br />2) give it to a scientist<br />3) smash it to bits, then flush it (remove batteries first!)<br />4) burn it (remove batteries first!)<br />5) Why on earth would you destroy a scale? A precious piece of technology? It&#039;s easier to get rid of drugs, and claim innocence, then to take your paranoia out on your solid state piece of gravitational wonder.<br />6) STOP DOING SO MANY DRUGS, you&#039;re just paranoid.

				It knows your secrets and must be destroyed. To destroy a scale, you must shoot it at 20 yards with a .45 caliber handgun and give it a viking funeral or its soul will haunt you for eternity.

I have a fair number of visitors to my home. I&#039;d prefer not to have to go through the house &quot;cleaning up&quot; before they visit.

As for why it seems I&#039;m more concerned with paraphernalia than the actual drugs I guess it just goes with being treated as a user vs a dealer. If I was to ever get caught I have a clean record so I can see maybe just some community service, rehab, or bullshit punishment like that being thrown at me. But if they were to decide to try to paint me as some sort of dealer, that&#039;s when jail becomes a very real and scary possibility.

This guy gets it. You guys are trying to paint me as some sort of nutjob. While I won&#039;t rule out the fact that drugs may be to blame for a slight increase in my paranoia. I&#039;ve always been the type of person that&#039;s always thinking about the worst case scenario and try to stay prepared and as safe as possible. I&#039;m rarely in possession of anything over an ounce and now I am going to keep the scale by the jewelry so I can sleep a little easier now.
