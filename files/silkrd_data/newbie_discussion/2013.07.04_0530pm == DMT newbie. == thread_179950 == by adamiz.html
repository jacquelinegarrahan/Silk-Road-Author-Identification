				Ok people, need some help.<br />I got my 100mg dmt, got my glass pipe, got my torch lighter.<br /><br />The thing that has confused me is this.<br /><br />Should I mix it with something?<br />Some people say some spice might be good, other mix it with cannabis, others says the ash also works and other say just vaporize it pure.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any spice to mix and I don&#039;t want to mix it with weed.<br /><br />What do you suggest?<br /><br />All yours <br />Adamiz

				mix it with weed and make sure not to burn the DMT.<br /><br />I prefer to use a vapor genie over&nbsp; a normal pipe for this reason.

				Weed eh? Was hoping to avoid that. (don&#039;t know why although I love weed).<br /><br />I have also this vaporizer http://24.media.tumblr.com/wJhgwX9UnjelqclsDvie1nkio1_r1_500.jpg<br />But It has a strange chamber that I don&#039;t really trust

				You might find that you misfire(burn it all up) your first few attempts. Smoking it in a regular pipe takes a lot of practice and is hit and miss.<br /><br />The vapor geni pipe make it super easy.

				Ok will try it with weed.<br /><br />One really stupid question and sorry for sounding silly, but if I don&#039;t ask I won&#039;t know.<br /><br />The lighter should be under the pipe and I will wait for the vaporization right? <br />Not like like usual cannabis/pipe smoking when you hold it above and inhale so it can burn?<br /><br />:)

				Well my first try was a failure. (5 minutes ago) I put around 30mg to the pipe, had my torch lighter a few cm down and after some seconds when dmt started to melt (there i gently moved around the pipe for better vaporization). Then the pipe was slowly fulling with white vapor and when it started to come out from the little hole I slowly started inhaling. (was expecting nastier taste but, that was tolerable). I did this 2 times until there was nothing left in the pipe and lied down. Tried to keep the smoke as long as possible but somewhere I must be wrong..<br /><br />Any advises?<br /><br />Other details I should probably mention are the following.<br />Only at the very end my pipe became little black,<br />The second inhaling burned my lips a bit,<br />And that the chamber of the pipe is really small must I say.<br />Nothing happened :(<br /><br />Do you think maybe making a&nbsp; bigger pipe (ex from bottle so that I can make more vapor) is a good idea?<br /><br />Thanks again<br /><br />Adamiz<br />&nbsp;

				I would just stick to a regular bic. IMO using a torch is too risky. A regular flame is already plenty hot enough to burn up the deems and waste it if you&#039;re not careful. What kind of pipe are you using?<br /><br />There&#039;s a sort of steep learning curve when it comes to vaping DMT in order to get a good dose. 30mg is on the low end, especially if you&#039;re not sure you&#039;re getting it all in one go. <br /><br />

				Try putting a smal bit of herb in a pipe, then the dmt in the center of the herb(not near the edges), then a very small amount of herb on top.<br /><br />Then light just the edge of the herb so that the cherry slowly spreads from the edge over the middle. Inhale slow so the cherry does not get too hot or move too fast.<br /><br />Ideally you want a vape pipe, but I have had some success like this.

				As a precautionary measure, when you vape the DMT make sure that it doesn&#039;t puddle.&nbsp; By this, I mean that it turns to a liquid; this means that there is still solvent left in the crystals.&nbsp; If this does happen, let the solvent vaporize of FIRST, or you will get a nasty lungful of solvent.&nbsp; Good luck to you, and enjoy faster than light speed travel!&nbsp; ;)

				So you got a glass dick and some powders but donno wtf to do.<br /><br />Put a lil bit of the powder into your device (dmt is actually active in consciously aware humans at 5mg vaped).<br />Hit it with the coolest part of your torch until you see it start to melt and bead up.<br />Let it pool, then gradually increase the heat.<br />You do not want it to boil or SMOKE BLACK.<br />Allow the molten liquid to start to vape slowly, then hit it with a bit more heat.<br />Maintain proper temp on the bowl till its all vaped.<br /><br />Now load it up and hit your friend, then have them hit you, most of the time 2 lungfuls is all you need.<br /><br />I usually hold my first lungful for 70% of my breath time (like the longest&nbsp; Ican hold my breath underwater)<br />Then shoot for blastoff on the second hit, which is maximum capacity of lungs that I can hold for 100% of my breath time.<br />If you are not astral light by then, you should wait 45minutes to three hours to let your brain and body metabolize it, and give you a baseline worth trying again.<br /><br />Good Luck! See ya on the other side... maybe ;)

				I&#039;ll probably do more research before I buy/consume, but I plan on just getting a meth pipe and a torch lighter.
