				I got an order from someone with decent stats. 1500+ in business, 0%, and 0%.<br /><br />Customer left his address unencrypted. I check addresses to make sure they are valid before creating label for package.

				something does sound off about that seeing that he has done a modest amount of business on the road and should know to always encypt your address. As far as the po box being in the same location as other municiple offices is quiet normal in small town america. I&#039;ve lived in towns such as that where all the public services shared the same building where I could mail a package , see my po, avoid the cops and report a fire within 50 feet of each other lol..but deffinatly the address unecrypted is a small alarm..could of been accidental though.<br /><br />I would wait for response and depicted on what they say would sway my descision .

				That sounds like LE.&nbsp; Dumb enough not to get another po box or don&#039;t have the funds; all the while taxing the citizens to be able to make multiple drug purchases and then destroy the drugs. :/<br /><br />Honestly, using the exact same po box # and everything, I would just cancel the order.

				It&#039;s been said that vendor&#039;s should prepare every package as if they were sending it to the DEA headquarters or a police station. <br /><br />Personally I would cancel that order and decline to send it because that situation is sketchy.&nbsp; As a vendor I retain my right to refuse service for any reason.&nbsp; While I know that LE will probably order from me at some point(if they haven&#039;t already), and I feel confident that all my packages are clean, I wouldn&#039;t tempt fate and purposefully, intentionally send a package to LE.

				I got a message from the user. He sounds legit as far as I see it. I&#039;m not too concerned any more. It&#039;s a small ass town and actually kind of normal to have all the municipalities share one box. Plus, I don&#039;t think the PD in Bumblescrew, Americaland really knows enough about the SR to start making orders.
