				Hey!<br />Few questions:<br />1) I wanted to buy something here on the road, and i bought some btc from a company on the regular net, with credit card and not with cash.<br />After i got my coins to my wallet, I sent it to my SR account, and then I bought some MDMA.<br />Does the fact that i bought with credit card can cause the LE to keep an eye on me?<br />And if I once entered to an non-tor website through the tor browser mistakenly, is this bad?<br /><br />2) I&#039;m heading for my first whole acid experience, as im planning to eat one blotter of jannis&#039;s dolphins.<br />The thing is, I&#039;m constantly suffering of back and neck problems, that act as really high tension on the muscles.<br />What I&#039;m worrying of, is to be concerned of it all along the trip, because as i know weed for example really increases the tension and discomfort, and as i know myself, sometimes i cant think about anything else but my back, even when I&#039;m sober, and I really feel as if it blocks my energies...<br />Do you think that maybe the opposite will happen, that i won&#039;t be concerned about it at all, because of the mental explosive?<br />And generally, how acid affect physical feelingsand/or physical discomfort?<br />Same question about MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to get some advices :)<br /><br />sorry for being a lil bit to paranoid about the way things go with the btc and the tor and this shit..<br /><br />Thank You!

I&#039;d suggest trying a psychedelic that doesn&#039;t last as long such as 2C-B and then at least you can get a feel for how it&#039;s going to affect you without being locked in for 8+ hours.

				It is very unlikely that there is strychnine on any LSD blotter. This is an old rumor, and I cannot believe people on here are regurgitating it as if it was fact.<br />The statements made a few posts up about it being the cause of back pain, jaw clenching, etc is complete bullshit. That is nothing but &quot;street knowledge&quot; that is being regurgitated without any actual research. It sure would be nice if people checked their facts before acting like they know what they&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_myth5.shtml<br />

				MDMA has a mild analgesic quality so you&#039;ll probably be tensed up but won&#039;t realise until the drug wears off and you can feel the pain. That&#039;s what all the &quot;sore jaw/teeth from clenching&quot; stuff is about.
