				I&#039;ve never done it.&nbsp; I once worked near a Yemeni neighborhood where a &quot;khat bust&quot; occurred and I always wondered if I could wait around til somebody who looked shady showed up and ask them, but that plane never got airborne.<br /><br />Comparisons with khat and synthetic cathinones?

				i chewed rather a lot of it when i was in Kenya, to be honest didn&#039;t think much of it, wasn&#039;t a very pleasant thing to be chewing, tasted pretty bad even when mixed with chewing gum, Also you had to chew loads to get any sort of effect, it required quite the dedication to stripping the bark off and constantly chewing it. Buzz-wise a strong espresso coffee would have a similar effect without the bitter taste. Its rediculous that they&#039;ve banned it because as narcotics go its a pretty weak shit one and although seriously excessive amounts can damage your liver its not particularly toxic either, stupid governments sticking their noses in other peoples business

				I swear all our drug laws are based on rumour and race.<br />The first drug laws baning opium because they though asains were selling it<br />The USA slip on a bit about weed because they thought it made black men rape white women (and it was a threat to the timber industry)<br />And now Khat which is done mainly by North-African-Britishes. What about coffee/tea or Alcohol/tobacco??? our drug laws are retarded.<br />It&#039;s because it&#039;s soully made by a govt. which knows nothing about drugs and won&#039;t listen to the facts even their own experts who are there to advise them!!!<br />AAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

				its annoying isn&#039;t it. Not wanting to reform them then just comes down to governments refusing to admit they were wrong, they don&#039;t wanna say that something they previously told us is really bad for us is actual ok or beneficial to us, people will just question what else they are lying about then, and of course then theres the fact that some of these narcotics are threatening to other medicinal or mild legal narcotic industry

				Khat has to be extremely fresh to be strong, the active alkaloids break down within days of it being picked. So most of the stuff people use in foreign countries is useless by the time it arrives, you have to grow it yourself to get much from it.
