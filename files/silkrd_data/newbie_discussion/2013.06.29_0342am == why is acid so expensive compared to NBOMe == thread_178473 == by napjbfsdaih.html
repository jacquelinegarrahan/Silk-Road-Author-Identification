				One hit of LSD costs $5 to $10. NBOMe is $0.4. That&#039;s over 100x cheaper.<br />I&#039;ve heard some horror stories with NBOMe, though. So, is it worth it?

				NBOMe is fun. It&#039;s easier to make than LSD, hence the price variation.

				i dont get why people compare these two drugs, in my opinion there not even close, to me nbome is way different more like molly and shrooms x100 lol,my problem is 25 always makes me throw up, im not complaining though, the visuals get even better ;D but then again after trying 251 i like it alot more. i love how cheap it is, a huge money maker! plus i think its better for big groups just hangn out imo.

				It affects a lot of the same receptors, but at different ratios, or different subsites of the receptors. The reason for the comparison is because they are both active on quarter inch square blotters, and they&#039;re both strong as hell and very psychedelic.

				I&#039;ve just ordered 25 25i-NBOMe&#039;s and I cant wait till they arrive... coming from a poorfag, I just wanted to be cost effective and instead of buying 1 or 2 acid tabs, why not 25 NBOMe&#039;s! (Although I have no experience on both), I&#039;ll at least have enough to last me 6-8 weeks! <br /><br />By then I&#039;ll have cash saved up to get something else, or more NBOMe&#039;s and something else! <br /><br />I am aware of the bad effects of NBOMe after doing my research, and chances of ODing are possible, so I&#039;ll just be smart about the dosage knowing that being a milligram off can make a huge difference. Not to mention that it builds tolerance but doesn&#039;t last too long... I don&#039;t mind waiting a little longer till I try acid

				LSD all the way, it&#039;s worth the extra, cleaner, safer, more fun every time.... but to answer your question and it&#039;s already been mentioned, it&#039;s all got to do with the cost of the manufacturing process the cost and control of LSD precursors such lysergic acid or lysergic acid amide and ergotamine.

				I prefer 25i over LSD any day actually. I have more fun on 25i and i can be around other people. but if i just want to destroy my ego ill do LSD and i have to be alone or shit will go down like multiple perspectives and stuff.. Dont enjoy mushrooms at all though. LSD for me last up to 14 hours have no idea why but cant sleep for two days. with 25i i can fall asleep 9 hours after dropping almost every time and feel like nothing happened the night before. much easier on the body than LSD<br /><br />Wish LSD was cheaper tho so when I actually want to do it about once every 4 months i dont have to pay 30 dollars for two tabs.<br /><br />Also hope to be trying 2cb for the first time soon cant wait.<br />
