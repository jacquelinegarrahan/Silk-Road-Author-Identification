				Hey,<br />The domestic page for Australian cannabis is usually packed with about 50+ listings for weed alone. The last time I logged in all the sellers had stopped listing overnight and there were only 2 or 3 high priced sellers left.<br />Just wondering if anyone can think of a reason why this might be? It seems unlikely that all the sellers ran out of product at once. Or perhaps they were spooked by something? Perhaps an problem with memory on SR&#039;s part?<br />Either way those sellers that are left will enjoying making more money than they usually do.<br />It still puzzles me though.

				My assumption is it&#039;s just the time of year.<br />I bet a lot of listings for outdoor will start popping up around April, and the price will go back down, and the choice back up.

Wrong tab. Cheers tho<br />I meant this bust <br />http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/huge-interstate-drug-ring-smashed-by-police-in-south-australia-western-australia-queensland/story-e6frea83-1226565781069<br />I was pretty cooked...this shut down many people I know of. Pounds of weed at a time in the post? Silly business. Was only a matter of time...albeit several years at that volume.<br /><br />But anyways 2003? yeah wtf...
