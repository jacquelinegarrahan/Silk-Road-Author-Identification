				I saw someone offer Bitcoins for a favor, so I was wondering if anyone else needed anything done for them, or had maybe .10 btc or so burning a hole in their pocket. The only way i can get any other than that right now is to make a vendor account and list my 25x&#039;s for sale (I have two variations of 25I). But I still haven&#039;t even figured out how to look at my account page... So I&#039;m a ways from figuring out how to be a vendor and listing anything... <br /><br />1GUgu99U35Ahx22pQJbpnzZSN27PQSAkWu<br /><br />

				If you don&#039;t have .10 btc, you won&#039;t be able to open a vendor account because it, too, costs bitcoins.

				I could be mistaken but doesn&#039;t it cost about 500 USD to start a vendor page now?

				$500?!??! That&#039;s insane. So you have to already have products AND money to be a vendor... I guess it&#039;s gonna take me longer than I thought...

				I appreciate that it costs $500 to become a vendor.&nbsp; I imagine without this, and other safeguards in place, this would become a back alley NY city neighborhood instead of a relatively closed off community of mostly well intentioned individuals.&nbsp; I work hard for my money and put great faith in the system.&nbsp; In lieu of the initial requirement, I think all sellers should have to wait for Auto Finalize times for there first three months or so, would negate scams even more.&nbsp; But I like the system that exists as without it, this would all be a very different universe.

				Well, you can also apply to get your $500 bond refunded.

If they had to wait for Auto-Finalize it would mean it would take forever to re-stock their items. The venture would never get off the ground for a vendor if that was the case...Just saying ;)<br /><br />

				Are their other places where you can trade items for bitcoins?<br /><br />The stuff I am trying to sell isn&#039;t even illegal to buy/sell/trade (but it is stuff that people already sell on here, and they charge too much in my opinion), I just don&#039;t have any money to become a vendor. All I have is product :( Hopefully eventually I&#039;ll be able to do it...
