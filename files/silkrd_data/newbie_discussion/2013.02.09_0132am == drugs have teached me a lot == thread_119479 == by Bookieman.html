				Some drugs teached me a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Well, even the biggest dose of lsd didnt teach me not to forget at times an irregular verb form expecially as a non-native speaker, <br /><br />but it thaught me not to be so cocky about it for sure!! ; ))

				I do actually feel I&#039;ve &#039;learned&#039; things on drugs. Nothing factual, as such, but my outlook has changed for the better. For example, after taking MDMA, I think I&#039;ve become less cynical and more social. It&#039;s like I suddenly saw that communication doesn&#039;t have to be difficult, and I don&#039;t always have to consider 101 things before I say how I feel.

				drugs don&#039;t teach you anything. period. drugs open your mind and allow you to learn new things. They aide you in getting there but in the end it&#039;s entirely up to you if you chose to learn on drugs vs the quick fix you are looking for.
