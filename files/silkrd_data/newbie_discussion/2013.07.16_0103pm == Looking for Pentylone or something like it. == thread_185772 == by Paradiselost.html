				I don&#039;t party very often. My purchases here are for a loved one. However I did try some Pentylone a bit back and really enjoyed it. I&#039;ve never done any speed before, other than coke which really isn&#039;t speed I guess, but honestly it didn&#039;t do anything. Tried crack for a few months and honestly all I wanted to do was hit the pipe again. I didn&#039;t carpet cruise, but I was geeking all night, every night lol.<br /><br />So I&#039;m looking either for good Pentylone and/or something like it. The biggest thing I enjoyed from the penty was the empathy. The desire to be chatty and open up with people.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard X is like that but i&#039;ve only had X once, red bulls from here on the road and not sure I felt anything from it. They are supposed to be 100ish mdma, and 30mg speed, but after an hour neither me or the girl I was with felt anything. However it did lead to me busting out the pentylone I had so perhaps it was starting to lower my inhibitions. I do have some mdma power from dieseltherapy which I haven&#039;t tried but the GF and a friend did try it (IV she IVs everything...) and they appeared to have liked it.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve tried methylone, the high I got was kinda like penty, but it came and went, wasn&#039;t impressed. And didn&#039;t make me chatty or want to open up. I have some pentedrone, butylone, 4FA,and mkat around, but based on observations from my GF IVing them, none are as effective as Pentylone. I also have some Meth, but that really scares me honestly. Not sure what a first time dose snorted should be. I don&#039;t want to be high for 12-36 hours lol.<br /><br />I have some H around, GF drug of choice, but the strongest opiate I&#039;ve done is vicodin. The stuff I have is a mix of freeway and dieseltherapy and deezletime. Had a half of DT and quarter of freeway and 13 stamps (slightly over a quarter gram) from deezletime, she tried the stamps and dt&#039;s and both were just slightly above the street quality here so I combined them, then added Freeways. I guess I didn&#039;t mix them well enough because 1 shot threw her to the floor. Mixed it up better after that and she&#039;s been really high but not near OD status lol. Anyway I&#039;m leery of the H and no clue how much or how it should be done best. (again no IV)<br /><br />I&#039;m just looking to have a good time occasionally, enjoy good company, fuck like mad, and preferably not geek insanely at the end. Lowered inhibitions in the form of empathy and chattyness are the major desires.<br /><br />Also, something that won&#039;t make it a bitch to get a hardon would be nice. Pentylone and Methylone so far have both made that a real pain.<br /><br />I snort other than the X pills, though I&#039;m interested in trying bombing I think it&#039;s referred to, oral. Not ready to try things in the butt yet and I&#039;m not moving into IV due to my addictive nature.
