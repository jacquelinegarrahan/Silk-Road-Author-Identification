				I ordered a g of ethylphenidate and today the post office mailman asked me to sign a form saying I knew the contents of the package weren&#039;t for human consumption and legal. Thus, he implied it was legal but I don&#039;t know. It was so weird. I obviously refused, choosing to be cautious, and now I don&#039;t have my package :(.

				I&#039;d say you made the right choice. The form obviously implied they inspected the package and knew the contents. Also signing would imply you knew what it was and were expecting it. After signing and then getting questioned asking you what you were using it for would lead no where fast.<br /><br />What country was this in?

				ethylphenidate is legal i believe.&nbsp; You can order it from Research Chemical Websites...<br /><br />So I think you would have been fine.&nbsp; However I may be getting the chemical mixed u with another, so maybe you made the right choice.<br /><br />The fact that they asked you to sign it meant they surely must have inspected the package.&nbsp; I dont know on this one

				Ethylphenidate is not illegal in the US, but it may be considered an analog of methylphenidate which is a Schedule II drug. The form you were asked to sign may very well have been from the seller. It&#039;s not uncommon for RC companies to play CYA with these forms.

				The reason i posted what i did was because I have ordered elthyphenidate from an RC site a while ago, so at the time I did that it was legal.&nbsp; I didnt mean to piss anyone off with that post, I just was saying that when I last came accross the chem it was legal.&nbsp; Maybe I should have checked its current legality before posting, so sorry about that.&nbsp; I didnt think I would get such a burning for a comment like that.&nbsp;

				You did the right thing in my opinion. Better safe that&nbsp; sorry.<br /><br />Research chemicals are a grey area at the best of times. The &quot;not for human consumption&quot; label keeps you safe, but some countries&#039; posties/customs are more clued up than others. <br /><br />My personal rule: Don&#039;t sign for anything from SR. <br /><br />

				I have had to sign similar forms for RC shipments, however, they were never presented to me by the postman like this. However it seems doubtful that the form presented to you was produced by the USPS. Lets look at the chain of events that would likely have to occur: 1.) Open the package (requiring a warrant in and of itself). 2.) USPS PAYS their own $$$ to send a sample of its contents to a third party lab for GC/MS analysis. 3.) Wait for the results, confirm the research compound identity. 4.) Reseal the package, and print up a special form for you.<br /><br />Seems kind of unlikely.<br /><br />At any rate though, being asked to sign a strange form upon receiving a package can catch anyone off guard if it is totally unexpected. If your vendor requires anything like this they really should have informed you. Did you read their profile/listing carefully? <br /><br />At any rate, I would consider my bridges burned in regards to that drop point. <br />
