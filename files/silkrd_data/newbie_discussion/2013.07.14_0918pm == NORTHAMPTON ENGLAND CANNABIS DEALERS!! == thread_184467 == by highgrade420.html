				Hey everyone! i know this thread is a little bit specific but as i have used Silk road before (under a different username) and i have purchased online! without the fuss of waiting and having to plan in advance!<br /><br />I was curious is there are any cannabis dealers in northampton UK, preferably ones that can deliver although meeting may not be a problem!<br /><br />If you know of anyone or you, yourself are a weed dealer please post on this thread!<br /><br />(oh, and i have been smoking weed for many years! so i really only want good weed, no homegrown shit! im talking amdam!)<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />420

				Not a good idea asking to meet up with vendors here, YOU could be LAW.? I see its your first post, but you need to think why you are here and thats to buy (whatever) you mostly cant get legally.

				Like Red Eye said, nobodies going to meet up with you because you could be a cop, and if you aren&#039;t you&#039;ve just helped the cops narrow you down from being 1 in 62.74 million people in the UK to 1 in 212,000 people in Northampton. You really should be careful about what information you give out on here. I know this is your first post, but if you carried on in this careless manner, it would be no time at all before law enforcement watching the forums could use all the little clues you&#039;ve given away to work out who you are. Why not just use the service provided here? Most UK vendors can do next day delivery.

So it really wouldn&#039;t be hard to profile someone, especially considering most of the population are elderly or farmers lmao.

				Replies are appreciated, i do understand the risks involved and while i do understand that its narrowing down who i could be... at this moment in time, i could be male, female, 18-70, black, white, eastern european. Id be pretty surprised if the police force in northamapton (a poor one at that) would be able to suss me out lol But again thanks for the replies, i will keep that in mind and not ask for meet ups with Vendors<br />Many thanks,<br />420
