				This is awesome! Sorry you haven&#039;t had good initial service but Silk Road definitely has more room for LSD vendors. <br /><br />Good Luck and you should post a link to your vendor page, which has more info and all of your products!<br /><br />Just one question: What does WoW stand for in your product? Am I going to get an Orc on my tabs? LOL

				Sorry no Orcs on tabs. WoW stands for White on White. Basically all my tabs come from straight unprinted un-perforated watercolor paper. No needless fancy designs. No blaming any bitterness on ink. Just clean simple tasteless tabs.

				Unfortunately my intent to purchase was thwarted by this continual attack we&#039;ve all been experiencing on SR. So hopefully this gets squared away soon enough, although I&#039;m a bit worried with all the speculation going on in the SR discussion forums. But once the site is back up, I&#039;ll be placing an order and we&#039;ll see what its hitting for.

				Thanks so much guys, being a new vendor is easier said than done. I have now sent out the first batch of orders. All but the privnote orders have been sent. If you ordered using privnote, please resend your address. If you need help with PGP, there is thread right here to help you.&nbsp; I have not been able to confirm on them due to SR being down, but hopefully I should have some reviews coming in starting on Tuesday I estimate.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have posted in the avengers thread. I have decided to offer them double my rebate of 0.02BTC for them. I don&#039;t really want to give free tabs; not for financial reasons, but because there have been too many LSD scams. It&#039;s too easy to give out high quality free tabs, and then switch to lower quality gear. I want to help the road in the long run, in the best way I can.

				I was one of the first to order from you and received the 2 tabs in a timely manner. They certainly look legit. By the way, your stealth is excellent! I&#039;m really looking forward to trying them but I have to wait until I&#039;m at a music festival at the end of the month. If your offer still stands, I&#039;d be happy to write you a review and trip report of my experience. From what others have said, your product is definitely legit! I&#039;m stoked to have a good domestic vendor of this beautiful substance.

				Their acid is wicked awesome. Got two 100ug tabs and took them last Saturday. Railed 100mg of K shortly after dosing for some super stellar hyperspace visuals. Then after hour 2 when I was starting to really peak I popped 150mg molly (from alkaloyd - amazing vendor) for candy flipping fun. It was an amazing trip overall. Lasted around 10 hours. No bitterness whatsoever.<br /><br />I highly recommend OrderOfThePhoenix. It&#039;s great to see legit lsd back in the states.

				Seeing as this will be my first post on the SR forums, I&#039;ve gotta post in the newbie thread. <br /><br />I ordered two tabs a week ago, and after they were shipped, it took them about three days to arrive. Packaging was effective (and upon closer examination while tripping, I realized it was also very clever). The product itself was legitimate and very enjoyable. One of the cleanest feeling trips I&#039;ve had out of any psychedelic, and there was very little body load. The body high was extremely pleasant, and the head space was so acid. I&#039;ll definitely be ordering again sometime. <br /><br />Trip Report:<br />Dose: one blotter (100ug)<br /><br />&nbsp;My first ever drug experience was LSD, and I&#039;ve been a regular psychedelic user since then for the almost the last two years. I&#039;ve done a lot of different psychedelics, mainly different research chemicals, but I have had experience in most &quot;classic&quot; drugs like mescaline, shrooms, etc. However the substance I&#039;ve used most has been 25i-NBOMe. <br /><br />I dosed with three of my friends at approximately 11:35 PM, all taking one blotter, but two of my friends got theirs from a different source. The come up was very gradual and extremely gentle, and I spent it playing Pokemon Crystal on an emulator on my phone as we walked to a park nearby to lie down and look at the stars and just chill out and stuff. I finished beating the Goldenrod City gym and was noticing some effects, particularly a warm lightness to my body, and glows and auras around lights. We walked back to my friend&#039;s house after about thirty minutes and put Pink Floyd&#039;s Animals on the turntable, and decided it would be fun to play the original Star Fox on the SNES. I didn&#039;t play myself, but I watched my friends take turns. Staring at all the ridiculous combinations of rectangles and squares that make up all the on screen objects made me realize how much more I had come up than when I was lying down outside. Everything was glowing dimly and warmly, and because the game has a lot of frame rate issues, I was perceiving myself slowing down and speeding up the game in my head. <br /><br />Probably about an hour into playing, I was noticing lots of time distortion, much more apparent visual effects, as well as the most relieving and relaxing body high. However, one of my friends (who was having his first psychedelic experience), starting feeling nauseous and ran to the bathroom. He didn&#039;t end up throwing up, but he was a little startled and claustrophobic feeling, so we decided to go back outside again. After we managed to collect ourselves enough to go back outside (we all had the giggles), it was around 2 AM, so we had to be much quieter, which in turn made it harder to control our laughs. The night sky was extremely clear, and though the moon was about a half moon, it was still very bright. All the stars created a sort of blanket across the sky, it felt as if we were in a dome or massive planetarium. I was having extremely lucid, intense, and impressive visuals, both OEV and CEV. The stars were all connecting with each other, dancing and wiggling, and we saw several shooting stars, all of which trailed incredibly. <br /><br />We walked around some more, mostly letting our friend who was having his first trip lead the way, and it was amusing watching him figure out what it was like to trip. We returned back inside after about thirty minutes, though it felt like several hours. We decided that it looked like a lot of fun to build play with legos, since we were all feeling very imaginative and curious. It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and hilarious things I&#039;ve done on drugs, tears were streaming down my face nearly the entire time from laughing. I started to realize what a happy environment we had created, that it was just positivity and good vibes; we were just having pure fun. Legos are just pure fun, and it makes so much sense that they&#039;ve become what they are to our culture. Like, just imagine the ridiculousness of the fact that we have computer games that you just build legos in. I digress. <br /><br />I was still feeling some noticeably powerful visual effects, even after about three and a half hours in, and it was intensified once we smoked weed. We started cleaning up all of our legos and dismantling our absurd little creations after we realized how exhausted and tired our stomachs and lungs were from all the laughter, and also that we were pretty hungry. We spent a good thirty or forty-five minutes looking for real food, not just snacks, and wanted to make pancakes but were held back from the fact that all the milk in the fridge expired weeks ago. We all decided to wait until McDonald&#039;s opened up for breakfast at 5, and then drove to the one nearby (I do NOT condone driving under the influence of drugs, it&#039;s a very risky and dangerous decision to yourself and others around you. However, my friend who took a hit from the other source said that it was not nearly as intense as what I was feeling, and though he was definitely tripping, he felt capable of driving safely. Additionally, he&#039;s always seemed to require bigger doses of things to feel significant effects).&nbsp; <br /><br />We arrived safely and all ordered egg and sausage biscuits with hash browns and orange juice. It was absolutely delicious, and I was feeling euphorically content. A lot of the visual effects had faded away, though my perception was still noticeably off, particularly judging distance and vibrant colors. We drove home and listened to more records and just hung out and talked about what we had all been experiencing and reflected on things, and decided to smoke more weed before lying down to go to bed. This was at about 6:30, and I think it took me an hour to finally fall asleep, after finally losing interest in the different chirping of all the birds outside. <br /><br />Overall, it was a wonderful experience, one of the best trips I&#039;ve had. I definitely want to experience dosing more next time, as this was already so powerful at just a single hit.

				Nice report!<br /><br />Ordered a few LotS tabs yesterday, still processing but should be on the way shortly. Hopefully it is as good as your experience was!<br /><br />Has anyone tested the tabs yet? Just want to make sure I know it&#039;s legit, because people are claiming you shouldn&#039;t be tripping that hard on such a low dose..

				I ordered 2 of the 100ug tabs two weeks ago when OOP was out of the 5x and 10x sheets.&nbsp; Now i have a lot of experience with Mushrooms and i&#039;m a heavy weed smoker.&nbsp; This was my first time trying LSD.&nbsp; I took both tabs as I have a naturally very high tolerance for Mushrooms compared to everyone i know and what i read on forums.. so I figured 200ug would be the min for me.&nbsp; I was surprised how strong it was and actually made me feel a lot like a semi-large dose of Psilocybe cyanescens... but def not as intense and I was much more in control.&nbsp; Now when I take a large dose of Cyanescens i have a &quot;hang over&quot; after it wears off in the form of a pretty bad headache.&nbsp; With these 200ug&#039;s while i was tripping I had a very tense neck and upper shoulders/spine to the point where it was very uncomfortable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that this could be due to Vasoconstriction??&nbsp; Either way I was trippin pretty good for 10 plus hours on 2 tabs and i have an unusually high tolerance to psilocybin so I&#039;m assuming i would to LSD too.&nbsp; I plan on ordering more when OOP&#039;s in stock again and go for 300ug this time and see if I can get some visuals going!

And if you don&#039;t want to tell us, I hope you at least leave appropriate feedback. I&#039;ll be ordering LSD soon and I want to make sure I pick a good vendor.

				Can anyone with some experience attest to the 100ug claim?&nbsp; Better yet, if anyone tried k1llin&#039;s WoW hits could you try to compare strength? <br /><br />to Order of the Phoenix:&nbsp; Theres talk of a few different batches of yours going around, what print are you currently sending out?

				Trip reporttttt!!<br /><br />Alright, so last night a couple of friends wanted to long board in this tight ass garage close to my house and a friend asked to buy a couple tabs so I figured I would go ahead and trip myself while long boarding, since I had 25 WoW tabs and had not tested them. <br /><br />So I show up at 11:45 p.m. and my friend takes 2 at 12:00 and take a single tab at the same time. I just wanted to test them out and see how they were. They were totally tasteless. So we are just bombing this garage over and over then about 30 minutes in I get that anxious feeling and a smile starts to sneak up on my face. <br /><br />An hour in I was still coming up and almost took another but then I waited a few more minutes and decided 1 was PLENTY for me this evening. Hahaha. Man, these are pretty strong. So we are just boarding and I am laughing my ass off and I can not stop smiling. We are on top of this garage in the night sky and just looking at all the crazy lights and tall buildings. It was awesome. My body felt awesome. I had that clean electric feeling in me and I kept gettting chills from flying in the wind. These white lines in the concrete started to raise up and wave around and looked like water!<br /><br />At about 3 a.m. I have to go get some water for everyone and boy was that trippy. My friend was in the passenger side so I was safe but that convenient store really tripped me out! We get back safely and just bomb the garage more and more. We finally decide to ride the streets at about 4. This was really fun. Just cruising in the city with nobody around. I had a slight body load but nothing that really made me uncomfortable. My friend that took two kept on saying, &quot;Man, I feel crazy! This LSD rules!&quot; <br /><br />I decide to go home at about 5:30. I lay in bed and my house is making some weird noises and I lay around for about 30 mins then fall asleep. <br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this experience and the acid was very very nice. I plan on taking 2 or 3 next time. OrderOfThePhoenix hooks it up with some great L for great prices. Thank you OotP!!! I would advise placing an order through him.

				Trip Report:<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t planned to write this up, but after the trip I just couldn&#039;t resist. ;)<br /><br />Last night around 5pm I took a carefully-measured-and-cut quarter-hit of the WoW 10-strip that I had ordered from OotP. I may have opportunity for a full trip in a few weeks and wanted to suss out the strength, etc., ahead of time. It&#039;s part of my process with any new batch/vendor. Keeps me from unintentionally overdoing it for the first real trip (yes, I learned this lesson the hard way decades ago with some tabs that were double-strength! ;).<br /><br />Anyway... I expected a little sparkle to the evening, and perhaps some added focus at a music rehearsal I had planned for later in the evening with some friends.<br /><br />So at 5pm I dropped. No taste whatsoever (gotta love WoW!), and I let it settle in my mouth for about 15 minutes before it washed its way down. I then started a minor project, setting some stuff up. I like to do this to take my mind off of the &quot;am I feeling it yet?&quot; that I always get. ;)<br /><br />At about 5:55pm I felt that familiar roll in my tummy and thought, &quot;ooh... stronger than I expected!&quot; Started getting some CEV in a dark bathroom. I distinctly recall having the &quot;this is 25uG? Feels more like 40uG&quot; thought. Time started moving REALLY slowly, in that most excellent way. <br /><br />I began perspiring a little more than usual (which is normal when Uncle &#039;Cid is visiting), and had time for a shower. Went into the shower at 6:10pm. Was in there for what felt like forever... got some GREAT thinking done... the water felt fantastic... Figured it had been nearly a half hour so I got out. After I dried off? 6:19pm. Gotta love slow time!<br /><br />The next 3 hours were spent playing music with friends. I don&#039;t normally choose to play music on my stronger trips, simply because I usually get into a pretty good headspace *anyway* when playing, so I&#039;d prefer to enjoy the acid a different way. But since I had the rehearsal scheduled anyway, this is what I did. And man... it was SO good. Grooves were deeper, harmonies were richer... I most certainly had that feeling of being one with the group. All the non-verbal communication that naturally happens when playing together was enhanced, and I was so energized! <br /><br />It was truly a fantastic peak, and I even got some OEV out of the corners of my eyes, though I honestly was paying more attention to what was going on inside my head audibly than what was happening visually.<br /><br />Conversations during our mini breaks were fantastic. I had already been pretty metaphorical during the day anyway, and this was amplified during the peak, for sure. We talked about relationships between chords like they were sisters, we talked about how we have to manage water displacement all the time... anyway, it was good conversations, and excellent connections were made between topics that usually aren&#039;t so obvious to relate.<br /><br />Just like a good trip should be.<br /><br />I&#039;d say that peak lasted from 6:30 until about 11:30, and then the comedown slowly trickled through. All very clean, but WAY more than I expected from a 25uG quarter-hit... all in a VERY good way. ;)<br /><br />Now I wish I was able to buy a 25-strip and not just a 10-strip from OotP. I was one of those who had an order in with Albion that never arrived and hadn&#039;t yet gotten my refund from him when I needed to order from OotP, so didn&#039;t have the BTC in my account to spring for the 25. But I do now. :) Perhaps when he restocks I&#039;ll need to order more.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a lot of different acid over the past 25 years, and even though I only took a quarter-hit, I can tell you that this stuff is amongst the best I&#039;ve ever had. Gotta love SR! And gotta love OrderOfThePhoenix! Thanks, man!!

				Right now I am only doing 10 strips and more. I could offer smaller listings, but I would end up swamped with orders, and my service quality would go down hill. I could have very high price small listings, but I really don&#039;t think thats useful. <br />

				okay so i started off with purchasing a 10 strip just to get a feel for OOTP&#039;s product and know what I was dealing with. Boy was I satisfied. I took 2 hits and i had three friends join me (1.5, 1.5, 3).&nbsp; I didn&#039;t log times or anything since I did not plan to complete a trip report. I sure wish I would have because this was my first real LSD trip and it was wonderful. Peak probably lasted 6 hours with effects wearing off about 10-12 hours after dosing. Would recommend if you are apprehensive about dealing with OoTP, this was my first SR transaction and I could not have asked for a better experience. Will be getting more here in about a month or so. Great stuff OoTP :)

				hello all,<br />concerning the &quot;**REAL LSD**&quot; in the subject heading, i was wondering if anybody here has ever received fake LSD advertised as real LSD. this undoubtedly happens all the time off the Silk Road. indeed, it has happened to me. but does this happen on the Silk Road? if so, is it uncommon? wouldn&#039;t the seller quickly be discredited and blackballed if purchasers noted the flavor / test results in their feedback for the product? thanks,<br />-soberman

				I have never personally ordered LSD from anyone on this site, so I can&#039;t directly comment. But when I started, just a few short months ago, the climate for USA domestic LSD was basically non-existent. I am glad lately the lsd has been flowing, and I would like to extend my appreciation to my fellow vendors as well. It definitely did happen to people, and yes they do get discredited quickly, but with nbome and other substances, you would surprised how many noobs you could pull wool over before that happened. The one vendor I remember in particular was kat, who promised good prices on bulk LSD and would not require FE. I believe &quot;she&quot; did however offer extra tabs or something if you did. A lot of people did FE anyways. She easily made back the SR fee 10 fold. She shared pictures of tabs, and reagent tests. She ended up sending people empty paper, and lots extra of it. Because of her, I choose not to post any reagent tab pictures or reagent test pictures personally and to not build pointless hype.

				What&#039;s the potency here?

				Well, my order never got switched over to &quot;in transit.&quot;&nbsp; I put the order in midday Monday, so I guess he didn&#039;t get to some.&nbsp; Only other thing I can think of is that the road went down for maintenance before he could alter his shipment status&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s the latter since it&#039;s kind of rough not to at least cancel the orders that he couldn&#039;t ship out in time.

				Looks like Phoenix is not going on vacation yet.&nbsp; He took down all his listings Tuesday / Wednesday, now today he put back up full sheets (100 tabs).&nbsp; <br /><br />I have one recommendation to Phoenix about his listings page.&nbsp; If he could put the date in front of all his messages in regards to the NEWS section, that would be really helpful.&nbsp; Right now the first message says DPR took the site down &quot;today&quot; (which was yesterday).&nbsp; One of the next messages says &quot;Listings are down, please don&#039;t message me asking when I am coming back, or when your order in processing will be (shipped)<br />&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;But then there is a new listing up but only for full sheets.<br /><br />Anyways, just a small request that would make reading the news section a little easier for all us customers.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />My order was shipped out on Tuesday.&nbsp; I am crossing my fingers that my package comes in wth tomorrow afternoons mail so I can take this 10 strip camping with me!!!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />One Love &lt;3

				Hello, thought I would post an update, so you guys all know I am still alive and well.&nbsp; Allow me to explain what happened. I had a large amount of tabs that I wanted to get rid of before my vacation, so I ran some sales. unfortunately my AFK life got extremely busy and SR was down most of the day during the day I intended to get all the orders out. <br /><br />Being vendor can be extremely stressful. Buyers do not always understand the stress of dealing with large amounts of customers in timely manner and making sure that there are no mistakes. It seemed like there was no way I could get all the orders out in a safe professional manner, so I made the choice to cancel all the orders left before I left for vacation. This choice did not come lightly as&nbsp; not only did it cost me THOUSANDS in potential profit, but more importantly also lets down all my customers who were excited to receive my product. I hope this has not damaged my reputation too badly. For awhile the listings were up after I canceled, because while I was sold out, when I canceled the orders I the listings were listed back up. I forgot to turn on vacation mode<br /><br />On to the good news. I have been traveling the world, its been a great substance free 2 weeks so far, well with the exception of hash and weed. Taking a detox, even from my favorite LSD has been nice. Getting a tan where the sun usually doesn&#039;t shine, and met all sorts of wonderful loving people from around the world. I am on the final 2(maybe 3 if I catch a ferry today) legs of my travels. I don&#039;t have a return ticket booked yet, so I don&#039;t have an exact date of return. But I will probably be back in about 2 weeks. <br /><br />When I come back I still have all the stock that I did not send out, I will somehow run a sale only for those whom I canceled on. Not sure how I can do that, but I think I will probably stealth list at a reduced price, and put the links on the forums? If anyone has some good ideas about how to do that, feel free to suggest them.<br /><br />PS. Lots of love in this thread, I love all of you and wish you could be here having as good of a time as I have had. My metal health and happiness has been higher on average than it has been in years. This break has been wonderful, and I can not wait to return to better serve the SR community.

				Review of OotP:<br /><br />I was very pleased with the quality of the LSD I purchased and the customer service OotP provided.&nbsp; I ordered a 10 strip and it came in 5 days first class delivery.&nbsp; OotP answered a question that I had within a day of me sending it.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait for OotP to restock. Overall, I was very pleased--OotP will be the first vendor I go to for LSD.<br /><br />Trip Report:<br /><br />I ate two tabs after I woke up in the morning.&nbsp; It took about 45 minutes to begin feeling the effects.&nbsp; This acid did not have the &quot;speedy&quot; feeling--which I really liked. However, the LSD gave heavy visuals and a general feeling of euphoria.&nbsp; I played with my dog--which is always fun while tripping.&nbsp; Then I took a stroll in a nature reserve near my home for about 3-4 hours.&nbsp; I would look down at the dirt path, and it looked like the earth was melting.&nbsp; Then I went to a pond in the reserve and watched the waves on the water. <br /><br />I hopped into my car and I smoked 2 bowls of some easyryder as I drove around the countryside.&nbsp; After, this I went to Trader Joe&#039;s and purchased a protein shake.&nbsp; Then I went home and played a video game.&nbsp; After this, I did some homework. Then I played video games again and watched TV. I smoked 2 more bowls of easyryder and I didn&#039;t have difficulties falling asleep.&nbsp; The acid seemed very clean and the trip lacked the &quot;speedy&quot; feeling but I had lots of visuals and a smile from ear to ear on my face the whole day.&nbsp; I highly recommenced purchasing from OotP--especially if you&#039;re from the USA because it will be shipped to you more quickly.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to see a reputable and trustworthy vendor that is located within the USA.&nbsp; ;D

				Fully agree!&nbsp; I ordered a 10 strip - my first SR purchase - on a Friday at 6pm and Saturday morning it had been shipped.&nbsp; Arrived in Tuesday&#039;s mail extremely well packaged, very professional. Had my first opportunity to test it yesterday.&nbsp; The strip I recieved measured 1/2&quot; by 1.5&quot;, so when divided into quarter-inch squares, 10 strip is more like a 12!&nbsp; <br /><br />I ate one at 1pm, felt some effects after about 45 minutes, with peak being about 2 - 2.5 hours in.&nbsp; Not speedy at all - very nice!&nbsp; I can&#039;t comment much on visuals as I spent the day at a crazy outdoor street festival with enough of its own sights &amp; freaks to entertain the eyes - but I can say that when I did finally get home about 7 hours later I was pleasantly surprised to still have visions to enjoy.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />Would definitely order again from OoTP and highly recommend! Thanks OoTP.

				Hello everyone. I recently purchased a 10 strip of the 100ug WoW strips from OOTP as well. It took a little while to ship (ordered tuesday morning, shipped friday morning, totally fine shipping time, i ain&#039;t dependent on this stuff lol). Packaging was very good. I wanted to write up a little trip report from a few days ago.<br /><br />I started out cutting myself a nice little .25&#039;&#039;x.25&#039;&#039; square off and swallowing dat fucker at about 6pm. I was pretty groggy going into the trip, had slept far too long and drank far too much caffeine the day before. I mostly just relaxed and listened to music for the next hour. I started to feel a little tense and lightheaded around 6:45, I always get that placebo am-I-feeling-anything-yet? feeling when I take psychedelics. I came up gradually until about 7:30 when I was feeling like I weighed less than a pound, I could hardly feel the weight of my limbs at all. Simply moving around felt really nice. All of my anxiety and grogginess had subsided. I proceeded to get lost in a picture book of the American Wilderness for about and hour. I stared at a picture of mass swarm of thousands of seagulls for a good 20 minutes, with minor visual distortions/patterning reaching out and flirting with my eyeballs, making my brain feel wonderful.<br /><br />I then decided to take another 2 hits to really get the party started. I sat around and watched to Daily Show and the Colbert Report, and quite enjoyed them, though I was distracted and over self-analyzing trying to judge how high I was going to get. I ended up starting another really shitty movie called The Kitchen, and by the time I was and hour into it, I was so disappointed by the fact that I hadn&#039;t seem to have come up much more on the cid, and the fact that the movie was so mind-numbingly awful, that I went and sat outside for few minutes. BOOM! Those 200ug hit with a vengeance within minutes of lying down on a couch outside. Suddenly I could see all the individual particles of matter that make up our universe, swirling and waving in everything around me. Not only could I &#039;see&#039; that the universe is all made up of the same substance, I could feel or understand it on a level that only psychedelics can provide. <br /><br />After star gazing for a while, I came back inside and put on Step Brothers, which made me laugh harder than I have in a long time. It&#039;s the Katalina fucking Wine Mixer. I was getting pretty sweet visuals, equivalent to about 3-4 grams of mushrooms, though the character of acid and shroom visuals are totally different. My screen would distort and look like I was watching a 3D movie without the 3D glasses, multiple varying colored images stacked on top of each other, faces would morph and look generally hilarious. If I focused on my bed, thousands of realistic looking spiders would start crawling everywhere. If I looked at my cat, she would grow feet of thick, black, curly pubic hair tell she looked like Reggie Watts head.<br /><br />After Step Bothers, the trip became quite introspective, and I thought about my life and my problems with what was sometimes enhanced clarity, though a lot of the time I would become entranced in the music that was playing or get lost memories. The therapy of looking at your problems from a somewhat altered/objective viewpoint that psychedelics provide is one of the main reasons I love them, it is so nice to occasionally decompress and get some perspective with a nice entheogen cleanse. That and the felling of universal connectedness that often accompanies trips (and was quite present in this one), makes hallucinogens a useful tool for self examination, as opposed to many other destructive drugs that provide escape and self-denial. <br /><br />Over all, I had a rad time, and I hope Order of the Phoenix is around for a long time to provide us with this quality, well priced substance that helps make life a bit more easy and enjoyable. Thanks Pheonix! <br />

				Update:<br /><br />Fast ship, generously cut blotter, great, clean trip (full trip report on Ootp main review thread)... everything was perfect.<br /><br />Tested with NIK just for shits n giggles and got very clear positive result, nice deep purple fast reaction, perfect result. Good pure Lucy for sure. <br /><br />Based on trip I would put concentration at about 100-120ug per .25&quot; hit, right on par with what was advertized. Good show OOTP!

				Trip Report:<br /><br />Dosed approximately .8-.9 of a hit at 5pm.&nbsp; Started feeling good after 40 minutes.&nbsp; After an hour and a half the trip started to take full effects.&nbsp; I was at a music show and there were a lot of lights and sounds and art everywhere, and I appreciated everything so much.&nbsp; I started getting very introspective and philosophical as I usually do on trips.&nbsp; At 3 hours in I was peaking with sounds having inner-sounds and tracers on everything I looked at.&nbsp; I could see all of the lights really well.<br /><br />Around 3.5 hours in I went into an alter-vision 3D experience place.&nbsp; I felt like I was floating in water, but in space at the same time.&nbsp; Everything was breathtaking and beautiful (and trippy!).&nbsp; From then on I went back to listen to music.&nbsp; I really felt the message that each DJ was trying to deliver with their music, and appreciated the brilliance of their work.&nbsp; At around 8.5-9 hours I started coming down back to soberness.&nbsp; Although, like with any good LSD, I was as sober as I have ever been while on the trip.&nbsp; My mind had all of its gears in motion and I felt like I had some great insights on life.<br /><br />Amazing product OOTP, thank you!&nbsp; Beautifully pure LSD.

Well I have had his fluff and I have a sample of the needlepoint on the way so I can give a comparison in hopefully about 1.5 weeks! The fluff was niiiice though so I am quite excited. :D With purer xtal there is no body load and the experience just feels really clean overall. It can be a little stronger too due to there being no impurities that could be in the xtal versus actual LSD. If that makes sense...

If you find a OrderOfThePhoenix on the web, just message me a message encoded with my pgp key(include your key too), and if you get a propper message back, it is me.<br />- --Signing Off<br />&nbsp; OrderOfThePhoenix <br />- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQINBFF7sOUBEADCJSU8V5u/Uw3hnu/+iPEks2aUlvH4RbhV4hL2QNSVbvo4GPjL<br />w+SuQhkhFsR3sSK+gIcLj47EC2pWxrrLEuGH2Cqr0eiGmmOJJKgfXzGyZGC9iG91<br />ZWIjBghwInS1HuJKCq7MLAr1X/7mLl6OE6Mu/mFWYy8WVOvVLf3P/uss2lWzs0QT<br />K/rfN580fFaV+BdfcCFjaz8d+dvF0jC2piZoWgL8KG8zYr5H/+i4hi0A7+wEe+5x<br />t+fWga5eaSoYVp+Wfy6//R0YOjkW4oeuYmwWN5AWTYzvZkwiTG67Cb2lTso7NKE3<br />RWsyPa7tTFIz35H+8xg+8+51Uw9jO32VRyDqu+Q+Tn7UNF9FlmXzGMyvi/5Npl6i<br />U3oMltyL7EQP/iL7fQ9gXcWBaIOFZ03XNrjoBmPn53pSmctroRhZ/ZvUcx7oWdeG<br />kyaICE6wFfzQMmJ+dvfLtKA5tecUaihItOhKD/FJ2aldGCIB7gn0kFNaJD9u5Axc<br />KDCaKTEg1avh+VfMTmtJjQ2L0Rbo5OU0t4LeBzwEowPwHtJJrJpJATFum+BTBQ3H<br />8+X2KO2rm3DIPAxUq+3Q/D68HTbvqgmxTBy8gb2z0NTQjvReOQOvIjUBzAIn9/JX<br />JAYeSJnbD6elXXS6gbzrcKJUwKJR2jGeeWAjHtI1sp22waXFenQY6U9wjQARAQAB<br />tDJPcmRlck9mVGhlUGhvZW5peCA8T3JkZXJPZlRoZVBob2VuaXhAc2lsa3JvYWQu<br />Y29tPokCOAQTAQIAIgUCUXuw5QIbAwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AA<br />CgkQtE98F3SNntQ1Fw//c3+U9RHishZCHuYfqL5aVRvYLc/rZ29eGEYFooaQfjZP<br />1SQY9KCWRKHe48tQN1NOTisq0fgJaHpjx6DgnAvVdVIqN3S1Ce0T6ruBtBRR21j5<br />Ie3sV03flxez77AuZb82VEYDRlvjJUPauK7gePsMU3KVSMhIfAxu8cUXfBCR8UqD<br />5MChq/soZZ4F+fie2/tBQEFLWwk0L5oG7xVRkYRnbsnKc2GrKVg6TYlLVBNzPWld<br />ePzp6pJ2B94iEyYZtMJDKLPkq4TQVLVKPjAeg044av5m48DAWntQ6iTFyZyDlnQs<br />nx+AcyJ59lyszvBMlhSaRrOqS7imSfmbY5LueaQ0rHmjSQcoEfIPRTqXNzImCO8z<br />Fy2/MqOpIS3/mCch3qVI1g0O4eOsQYYuTh805BawKS0SPyX7ifzf00P7Nqvp5OOh<br />Be3w/wJlt8G4cTwRDE+Po4tdpv55+rCkYiF31AvhgA5XBI/59duZHcUhX7nnESLg<br />QxdXl6FPnr/GXkaJBQ4qmgXLO7peO+cQ2vjMoLk349pP2g5fMwabuwBiwAhWv0yp<br />r4ag3AaFITuiQyhHFYrZWn38K1vxSPDzbTdfiSHuJCr9mfCBjMk190eVAzcFIcvg<br />qAdDGE3qluGmbGuMvmPeFHKbr3hIQCcsUBIc3z74pvdWUo8czjMk2wRKUszOof25<br />Ag0EUXuw5QEQAM3B5381+n5xCHC+c6JYqo5sNG6tH7w/ekQZfoKZQZ/c+1O78+g0<br />vu3Rg2sH9Ss0pBpbdcvpECUWpKvobrLCl2v8UpmC0aXBO7ObXO9zaSw+Oy1XzxPe<br />1F5uFjxNoUdz5F5AhhM22ixAfWhYVFRrTOnBAW5R3yXK8y4Y7hdZZjZDAfzdJYII<br />W1lcxqastxiALpau2XgQaaEKKsNH0oamriML0Dj9OdvVIE3oAU+zF/MFOqN8L7Yd<br />Xyt5RSABBhsVkur2mFzFkTpiAQ2MPIV3PwGFiM6+hUMaCQvnsqkYl88qOT1/WQf0<br />1ZxYpFO1I39Km94SGU6NHG87mKu8UK+BNoetJaMYShbR3MGBPaxoZsuREi8FRJ+V<br />z5LFdHIi8Atfx3pdLzJFiuBIzir/FH1nOU4kuR95sNdE82mxSZQPJn2QqVMvQ8jb<br />suRN4QMJQF6sUSWqW5muchGFKp2dqIXlbUHRPANB5DcH0cZs6jSmaC4zuUwdc0LE<br />BY+femxs/9DY18Iz4kwhE0y1TviBByn1i3WkJG69C1AIgKgK5x6iT4R0U+xwOOAz<br />AwmfWQmZtYewXJhM1D/jbQuEDH4Orj5m8915G/WnMqIXgSBxAGU2mlJLgjWa3O52<br />u6Yi3zmYSSMlamNUDMcj+KRkP2Dmfc/7iXgAHb/jl2MvYho3Y8V9hVhPABEBAAGJ<br />Ah8EGAECAAkFAlF7sOUCGwwACgkQtE98F3SNntQO/xAAr3JyFDQvyUUi0OO/lQEn<br />2bQQWg0r/ebBD5LXZFngFwGwB7IEWavnuVJyjapf1VyIhXeaJYLx52tQ4SdMgsjS<br />UhXLvCFy6MClJO71VuHPxTEwU999PJSgLHUPICHendLxEXF+aH0tooi/BVbqfB3I<br />t/PM7e+9kaXzagC4NVDQXAaUAe+V2QkL8lIBWa6m+s+gmvOUgVuC7U8zILCkn379<br />rUNlQXP9jklil1VrhmJf5KSU5WAmD6aW5ZRe8wderkBnO/zwXb5HB1AlA9wjsKJh<br />6WbF+BvMFfUCTcZx7z9lSTniU2ezAaStEp/7vNMSdG1z515weK/PDIzd1TP05Lyf<br />lndfPfcRO3o7IVXa79oQnV6ftfeRK6O3PL81Yb5yIcqyJNUfha78/uw2wJN7fhY4<br />1UIsa2OQ4nOOkfARF81OjPuFl7yRYnCdauaAayVx7ZmCUG3qyeboZ8o9h8vVK/NM<br />LfTYsk31Gsje5Zt66QWHI0TFRVCCNdB/MrxlKxxckZjEGHqFdhdo15C0gz39Xj0g<br />aNCMo+gcviZbWCdVUwHJUF1C9bXe71nS/8DRtrQbHWyAI5yYzfQjpn4Iu1BeJY0J<br />OQg9BYVceumG8cy8e/lzQUkdy7lAOgbZdcjt4V+E/1ho1LgWu/9UBSFERvbiDS4Y<br />oq5ekr+pW/En7dzPXBOjtc8=<br />=+bPT<br />- -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQIcBAEBAgAGBQJSVZ4qAAoJELRPfBd0jZ7UasYP+QFU2fZvYpANX5cWdGlj97t+<br />wRTmWalGVduDvXggfI3aMG+dLgmcnMCH8zaKYpDNod1dSLQLHRtXQNx4lBK7KkJw<br />ETcTpN5y1jfPqSG4GTk1c4/Ngz9nf2kTkuXzsf+Usw3mRsIFcm0DAIZ35taPzFND<br />0/h2e+msXpf5SR1MNN2a6yR33ypaB7PEi/mFBJrxSYdFl3vP30H5rlTnD8m2dNkq<br />nuHOlWYxtZIkmtLr+y3dyWngc5+OqU5yPzEBLXv4B2pT6DtyGzSaxrgZOe8Vk3Zx<br />Jig/TlQCJGYikKjG7IePM5wg6rTvbVfnvF1YZLYYzi4/sgaHRhAqMuxO/UBvVB9J<br />rysh444fE/LAWg6RJbDeSqF6GmmcgR7JyiZNGwl9l6gO+aW6UeK29WSF107h0LKS<br />IX6saYJPmiAFFkPjzmBltNdAYxkRSQ17vYrmZxzla58cV+DlVyLwE76kJwV9ZR6k<br />/hKmGPxN9+Eah3cuxWFc8TStwzu5nzomfrvg0/8hfTi4qajpisLgcq9JXK4w4r6a<br />QVBwxabZAf5V8B0g5qbRTKTgOevdYG6zICKEKBggxxKCZzaUKUad2qzw9xZAunuG<br />l/KnDhTSfwsotQPn//18CXmBnvVoP6iyaR7t0CUz8ySYy68C6FMrqEg69bsbkGMv<br />D3RtzZA/KRl900sCByAM<br />=cWZ2<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

				I did receive my 50 tabs from you and I am sorry you took a hit. I will follow you wherever you go and continue to buy your product.<br /><br />Does the offer still stand for a detail trip report? I had quite the experience on three of your tabs. <br /><br />PsychedelicSphere
