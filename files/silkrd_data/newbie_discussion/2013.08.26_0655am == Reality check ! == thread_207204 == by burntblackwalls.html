				Hey everyone I may not be a regular poster on the forums but I am an avid user of SilkRoad itself and before I became a regular user I was a lurker of many, many months watching this place go through so many changes and as users as well as vendors come and go for any number of reasons. There has always been one person that has been around and kept this fantastic place going, Of course I am talking about Dread Pirate Roberts ! The authority figure that started this entire concept we should all be so greatful for using every day. Recently this man and the how ever many of people they may have helping them run this site has started to rollout several new ways to view and collect data about vendors and other users.<br /><br />For months people have been requesting that the feedback system be changed to something more up to date and to be more helpful as well as make it harder for scammers and vendors alike to forge fake figures and take a free ride without being noticed.<br /><br />Now that for the first time Dread Pirate Roberts has actually hept us up to date and didn&#039;t keep us out of the shadows of what they had planned to implement lots of people were very happy about the changes and those that were not spoke their mind and so changes were made to cater to those people as well as iron out any flaws. As of now you could assume that about half of what is to be implemented is already out there and as every week goes by something new is added and things are fixed.<br /><br />Yet people are still not happy ? Why is this ?<br /><br />Is it because your little suggestion didn&#039;t get put into place ? Are you upset that it isn&#039;t happening the way you think it should be ?<br /><br />Guess what ! This isn&#039;t your site, this isn&#039;t something you are running nor have any idea how to run otherwise you would have your own site up and out there like BMR, Atalntis and SheepMarketplace.<br /><br />This place was setup to help the commuinity in ways that were not easily accesible to the average users ( 90% of you out there ) now half of the commuinity is saying that what Dread Pirate Roberts is doing to keep this place up to date and running is wrong and shouldn&#039;t be in place at all.<br /><br />You complained that things needed to be fixed and now that something is happening to solve that issue you are complaining yet again that it shouldn&#039;t of even been done in the first place ?<br /><br />Here is the reality check people, this is a free service ! users do not have to pay to par take in this great service, vendors only pay a bond that is then returned to them at a later date.<br /><br />No one is forcing you to use SilkRoad and there are many other sites that offer similar services, so why be niave and and spew nothing but dribble onto others that you either have no real evidence of a fault with the new system or just don&#039;t read everything out like you are meant to and use negitive comments to bash the things that others like and could really bring this place up to scratch.<br /><br />One sentence people &quot; Suck it up princes &quot;<br /><br />You should be talking to each other in a respected manner and using civil language instead of bitching and whining that you don&#039;t get your way like a 5 year old that your mom just put into the car seat and didn&#039;t give you a juice box.<br /><br />The quality of this place is determined by the commuinity and if the commuinity is acting like a bunch of spoiled children then the entire place is going to seem like shit. This is why I do not post very often because it just seems to be a small main group of people that are in a tight click and if you aren&#039;t on their side you must be against them.<br /><br />This is also the same example of why todays society is slowly crumbling into nothing but crap.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw
