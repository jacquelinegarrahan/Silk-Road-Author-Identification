				Im new at SR and was wondering if anyone would buy a small amount of addy 20mg IR tablets. I dont want to sell over 20 pills for that price but I just want to give a discount so people can give me reviews and I can become a trusted vendor. <br /><br />Hopefully someone can answer these questions :<br /><br />Would anyone be interested in giving me a chance to prove myself a trustworthy SR vendor? <br /><br />How much would it cost me to be able to sell on the official SR site? <br /><br />Any tips for shipping the addy discreetly and effectively? <br /><br />If theres demand for it I could even vend xanax (idk the dosage yet, ill have to ask my connect). <br /><br />The reason Im wanting to vend these pills is because I can get them relatively easy for a good price. ( perks of knowing ignorant kids with scrips). And i want to get some BTC in my wallet to purchase decent quantities of tree (ozs and up) to sell locally since the profit would be good here in the midwest. If your a weed vendor maybe we could even work out a weed/adderrall trade. <br /><br />Thanks

				Dont want to be a debbie downer, but I would take this down unless you have a vendor page, Its against the rules and can be a reason for the mods to ban you and your account. Im speaking from expierence because I was warned by the Mods for posting something similar. Its too risky for everyone involved to have posts like this...Just a heads up :)

				Yeah, before you can sell anything here, you need to have a vendor account.&nbsp; As long as you don&#039;t accept any orders without one, it&#039;s okay to still talk about it and ask for advice.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t actually sell anything until you have a vendor account and can do it all correctly through SR&#039;s escrow.&nbsp; :)

				I would be willing to chance a small bit of btc with you should you get your vendor acct established. Addies are satan&#039;s little helpers for all tasks mind numbling and soul killing.
