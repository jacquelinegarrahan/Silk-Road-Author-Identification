				Only if there is sensitive info in the message . It takes them time to encrypt/decrypt those PM&#039;s .

				Only makes sense for things like address. Just asking general questions like &quot;when will my order arrive&quot; or &quot;can I get a bulk discount&quot; are not worth encrypting IMO.

				Think of it this way.&nbsp; if ANYONE saw what you are about to say to someone, could it identify you OR the person your talking to?&nbsp; For example when placing an order and asks for an address, PGP.&nbsp; Want to comment on how packing it up in a paper bag with poo in it is a little less desired, PGP it (it then gives out how they&#039;re stealthing it which LE could use).&nbsp; Want to know if your order shipped? simply message &quot;Order status?&quot;.&nbsp; If someone sends you a message and you just want to acknowledge what was sent, reply back with &quot;OK&quot; in the clear is fine.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not sure, PGP it.

				As weird as it sounds, I have started encrypting anything that mentions a specific product. I would personally also do it for addresses, of course, and for any specific delivery dates. But that&#039;s just my personal preference...

				And oh yeah, PGP anything dealing with TRRRAAAACCCKKKIIIINNNGGGG!!!!! Sorry for yelling, but this information is just as important as your address esp since some fools sit at their houses and track their packages (that&#039;s my sarcastic way of telling you not to do this)<br /><br />-Judge

				Aren&#039;t address details automatically encrypted? If I understand correctly, a service such as Skype automatically encrypts all instant messages because both the sender and recipient have PGP keys installed with their software. I thought the ordering process on SR did the same?

The only way to secure communications is to do pgp encryption on your computer and then paste it so the only way it can be decrypted is when the merchant takes the message and decrypts it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the only way to know for certain the message is secure.<br /><br />Also I saw a story on clearnet where some security researchers noticed that skype visits urls entered in chat.&nbsp; It could just be something benign like making sure there&#039;s no exploits on it but that proves that skype can decrypt your message.&nbsp; Think I&#039;ve read another story about microsoft essentially saying they comply to &quot;lawful requests&quot; for chat transcripts.

				Think of it this way, if you wouldn&#039;t want LE reading it, PGP it. Simple, vague questions or messages don&#039;t necessarily need encryption. Like &quot;oh hey placed an order last night wondering if you ship daily?&quot; Or &quot;What&#039;s your policy on FE for orders over x amount?&quot; (Side note never FE).<br /><br />Neither of these contain sensitive info (address etc) or anything that could be used to identify you. But say you asked if the seller ships express to the Southeast US, or what the expected transit time to Warsaw would be. These narrow down where the package is going, I&#039;d say if you ABSOLUTELY need to ask a specific question, PGP it.

				PGP whatever you feel like is &quot;sensitive information&quot;, that can be addresses, btc addresses, names, locations, etc.<br />Anything that pinpoint a time, location, etc. should be PGP.<br /><br />If you are just asking a vendor about his product PGP should not be used, takes a lot of time to respond than.<br />When ordering you should use PGP for your address for sure.<br /><br /><br />
