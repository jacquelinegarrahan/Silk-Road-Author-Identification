				i think the reason that this is going on is because lately there has been so many spammers about bitcoins sales or w.e and this is simply a system to stop this and or deter them from continuing from doing that, its a great idea really, but its only going to piss off some of the frequent users

				There will always be spammers, but it&#039;s always due to new people fucking it up for those of us who can breathe through our noses.<br /><br />Before being forced to have 50 posts I was fine and no one had a problem with me because I wouldn&#039;t ask in some other subforum on an unrelated thread, HEY GUIS, HOW DO I BUY DRUGS WITH BITCOIN?<br /><br />Shit is retarded, I don&#039;t know how you get here and not know how to get a fucking bitcoin.

				Due to the nature of the deepweb its almost impossible to &quot;ban&quot; a user from using your website.<br /><br />That means you have to find other limitations and make it more annoying for them to get started. Sure 50 posts isn&#039;t a lot but a locked account is just a few clicks away.<br /><br />Culls the spammers and the garbage users who will likely congest the main site, better quality all around. I&#039;m all for it.<br /><br />Know what else? Be lucky they didn&#039;t add a system in where you have to get a established users referral to get into the system ex: early days demonoid or any of the countless private bt trackers.<br /><br />This really going to help and put meaning behind accounts that choose to have it and you can make 50 posts and have them taken from you eventually it wont be worth it.

				The unintended consequences of the new policy are worse than the status quo ante. It&#039;s time to scrap the policy and begin brainstorming for ideas that might actually work.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a suggestion to get the ball rolling: a simple word filter like what primitive email spam detectors (or blog comment anti-spam screens) use that sequesters suspicious posts for approval, combined with a simple flag for established posters here that prevents their posts from ever being flagged in the first place (thereby minimizing false-positives).

				The new policy is a bit annoying, but I think its going to clean up the forums a bit. It will at least slow down the spammers and should reduce those bitcoin scam threads. Also, it seems to me like half the posts I see on the forums are stupid questions that get repeated over and over. If all the newbies have to spend at least a few days or so on this subforum maybe this will be the only area that is flooded with junk posts and basic info that anyone should be able to find the answers to after 2 minutes of searching. <br /><br />While I think its a good idea over it is a little annoying for myself, having been here for about a year now. I don&#039;t post often unless I have something useful to contribute, mostly just browse and search. So it is a little frustrating not being able to contribute to the rest of the board. But if exceptions are made to the new rules, then they probably won&#039;t do much good.

				How crucial is it to boot from USB?&nbsp; I bought a brand new netbook and USB drive solely for SR-ing after lurking and researching for several months; however, I apparently got the lowest possible model and it doesn&#039;t even have a CD/DVD drive, which (if I am understanding correctly, looking at this thread for example - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101603.0) will prevent me from getting TAILS running on my USB.<br /><br />Are there any workarounds for this, or can I have your input into the necessity of booting from USB if I am otherwise doing the following:<br /><br />- Access SR only on via Tor Bundle on public wifi<br />- Use Netbook ONLY for SR and other TOR-related stuff (i.e. no mixing of ANY personal or clearnet info - no Amazon, gmail, etc)<br />- Communicate with vendors ONLY using PGP<br />- PGP keys saved to TrueCrypt volume on (non-booting) USB drive<br /><br />Where does the virtual machine factor into all of this - also needed?&nbsp; I have VirtualBox from Oracle installed but have not fully dived in.

What&#039;s also true is that you&#039;re practically the only regular/long timer/knowledgeable person left willing to read and post in the Newbie discussion forum.<br /><br />I actually did post a couple ideas for what would work better in two other threads. Those threads are buried now.<br /><br />My goal isn&#039;t to just tear down, I want to be constructive too. Considering what this forum has become lately, however, it seems like even the status quo ante would be preferable.<br /><br />I&#039;ll think a bit more about this while I go cook dinner, write my ideas up in a post, and PM you a link.

				Yeah I can definitely understand the reasoning behind the rules in place. I am a bit disappointed because I had planned on posting a couple of informative reviews regarding purchases I had made that I think would been beneficial to both the up-and-coming vendors and the SR community, but alas I cannot do that now without reaching the post limit. <br /><br />Oh well, I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t take all that long.

				50 posts isn&#039;t that much, and I kind of like the whole concept, but it wouldn&#039;t really work with all these damn spammers and dumbasses who rather spam instead of learn how to use SR properly for the own protection. Precautions and warning signs that newbies should know when detecting whether a vendor is a scammer or not, how to properly use PGP, or how to work out the BTC exchange, are among just one of many things newbies should know before even trying SR. This will ensure you have to have better success rate dealing on SR.&nbsp; Tbh, a lot of the users in this community have a lack of knowledge in harm reduction and drug interactions, they shouldn&#039;t even be bothered to try out these hard drugs that can be potentially dangerous, let alone ordering the god damn drugs off the net.

And since the paying the 50 vote price comes at the expense of a usable Newbie discussion forum, you&#039;re not getting your money&#039;s worth. When you pay the price. So to speak. Metaphors.<br />

				It&#039;s annoying, but if a spammer posts 50 posts in here, it&#039;s proven to be actual-spam (vs. for the sheer sake of hitting the limit for legitimate posts) - which means you can see them spamming in here and ban them before they hit 50.<br /><br />Although maybe a different/better CAPTCHA might help

				the reason why silkroad is making these posting limitations is because they know people shopping for drugs on a slow connection need something to occupy their time while they are placing orders.

				If you could obtain high quality drugs IRL then you would not be here. Besides, you can make purchases without getting to 50 and even read the other forums, really doesn&#039;t seem that bad.
