You either send the bitcoins to a reliable 100% several dozen transactions vendor, and I will send moneypak, or im posting you in the scammer thread. Period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />InfiniteSource(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no feedback?

Matter of fact i dont care if he&#039;s added or not but SCUM like that should not be allowed to VEND or surf here..&nbsp; You&#039;ve been warned<br /><br />Had to go into vacation mode until it gets cleared&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(&nbsp; I would kill this son of a bitch IRL<br /><br />here is my vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad

				SR doesn&#039;t offer support for bitcoin transactions, so there&#039;s not going to be anything for them to &quot;resolve&quot; because they will point you to the wiki and tell you that there&#039;s nothing they can do.
