				I have now had two vendors (out of dozens of successful transactions) claim not to be able to decrypt PGP encryption of my address. The first time, I was new and used privnote; product came okay, everything was good, that was months ago.<br /><br />Now a NEW vendor (with many good reviews though) selling a substance it&#039;s hard to get domestically in my country (that I am very motivated to acquire) claims he can&#039;t decrypt my PGP encryption and invited me to use privnote. I explained I would not use privnote and re-encrypted my address to his key, but I wonder if anyone else had had similar experiences and what it could mean. Encryption is a pretty standard process and I&#039;m not really buying the &quot;for some reason I couldn&#039;t read your message&quot; thing. <br /><br />I plan to cancel the order if he still claims he can&#039;t decrypt my message - but what could it mean? Dumb vendor? Genuine technical problem? Narc?<br /><br />Thanks for any input.

				sometimes the message doesn&#039;t copy over properly, I&#039;ve had strange linebreaks and double spacings.&nbsp; check your message and see if looks as it should.

				Thanks! The new encryption I just sent looks solid &amp; properly formatted, hopefully it will work.

				Yeah I re-sent it and he decrypted successfully - guess I was just being a paranoid cunt. Yay!
