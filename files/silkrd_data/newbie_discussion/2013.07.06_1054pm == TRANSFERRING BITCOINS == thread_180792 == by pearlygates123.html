				Im fairly new to this, hence NEWBIE board, I have a question regarding the transferring of cash to bitcoins from a website like coinbase.com, mtgox.com, bitfloor.com, etc.<br /><br />Im seeking the safest way possible for transferring money for bitcoins, my opinion is that using a bank account is the wrong way to go about this process and leaves traces behind (coinbase), im not to sure using this method.<br /><br />I think using moneygram or western union is the best approach to transfer cash into bitcoins, without concern of traces of your identity, etc.<br /><br />Any suggestions and advice is greatly appreciated, your experiences and methods you use transferring cash into bitcoins would be great for guiding myself and hopefully others confused in this process<br /><br />Thanks guys!<br />

				What I did today (but I&#039;m a completely newbie, keep in mind):<br /><br />Bought them via bank transfer (yes, papertrail), but then moved it to Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) and only then moved the coins in multiple parts to my SR wallet.

				Yeah, same question.&nbsp; Where can I even buy bitcoins for cash?&nbsp; Bitinstant doesn&#039;t seem to be working. I dunno either.&nbsp; Any advise from anyone would be appreciated.

				https://localbitcoins.com/buy_bitcoins worked like a charm for me, with bank transfer, but there are multiple options. Picked a seller with 100% rating, bc was in my wallet 3 minutes later.

				localbitcoins.com/buy_bitcoins worked great for you? you used a bank transfer, arent you worried of you identity being seen by someone? or do you think this was a safe way to go about purchasing bitcoins, and did your transaction go well on SR?

				I used to use bitinstant, via blockchain, all the time. It was quick and easy, and anonymous . It hasn&#039;t worked for me in quite a while, at least a few weeks. I even tried to bypass blockchain and go straight to bitinstant and have had nothing but problems. . It just doesn&#039;t work for me. Localbitcoins works pretty good, I do it using a Bank of America deposit option, that is anonymous as well.

				Lol Bitinstant...<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought that way a few times.&nbsp; They now require you to create an account and verify all information you submit to them against a national database...<br /><br />So it&#039;s safe to say I don&#039;t deal with them anymore.&nbsp; Not to mention it took way fucking longer and the fees along the way were just gobbling USD...&nbsp; So yeah, localbitcoins is a great way to do it.&nbsp; Personally I do cash, public places with wifi, and first names only.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Stick with localbitcoins, its very easy and anon if you don&#039;t use your phone to talk to the seller.Just did a transaction and it was in my wallet instantly. Look for feedback and stick with a rated seller.<br />Blueskytraders are great, bank transfer is easy. No name or information is given to the bank, just fill out deposit slip with the information provided by BTS and your done. Money hit my wallet within an hour, 1200 USD. Although they are down ATM but when BTC value rises again im sure they will be back.<br />TORMAIL for all communication if your not already BTW<br /><br />Forget the rest if you in the USA as it has become a hassel with provider services such as BitInstant. Stick with localbitcoin or BlueSkyTraders<br />Safe travels and update when you have done this or that&nbsp; ;)

				Being in the USA, I like BitInstant. I mean sure it requires ID and they charged me $25 on a $500 (maximum)&nbsp; cash deposit using MoneyGram but that deal beats a lot of the other vendors out there with their international fees. Even Bank of America makes domestic transfers heartbreaking for $35. I made the cash deposit and within forty five minutes the BTC was in my BlockChain wallet, then took one more hour to my SR account. It was a beautiful thing, really.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I was looking into localbitcoins as well but either the top rated vendors wouldn&#039;t bother with me because I was new or they only accepted payment through OKPay, which doesn&#039;t deal with us Americans at the moment. <br /><br />But hey, whatever works then pay it.
