				@zenthor I&#039;m not really too familiar with H however the one time I did try it I was told to take one or two hits (smoking) and play it safe (had no tolerance for opiates).&nbsp; I did just that and I was fine, snorting would probably be much easier to miscalculate how much to do.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure someone else will chime in shortly that is more experienced than I am that can give you better information for snorting.

				H? Is that Heroin? I never heard of anyone snorting it before. I always thought you had to smoke it or inject it after &#039;cooking&#039; it in a little water with some citric acid (to help it dissolve). Injecting is dangerous because you can damage your veins and there is a great risk of secondary infection from blood borne virus if you share equipment. However, I would never use Heroin because it fucks you up even if you can get a clean hit. Just my opinion

				Oh, and I forgot, Injecting is extra dangerous coz it&#039;s easier to overdose and you don&#039;t wanna do that

				/\ what Tobias said.&nbsp; My friends that did H were constantly telling me how easy it is to overdose on that stuff.&nbsp; IV will be hard to judge since you may get different quality one day and use the same amount but get different results.

				@zenthor have you tried asking your vendor?&nbsp; they would probably have a good idea on how much to snort based on the strength of their product.&nbsp; Your other option would be to start off with very small amounts and work your way up slowly

				It&#039;s just that I never heard of anyone snorting it before, but I just found out that it can be done. Haven&#039;t seen anything on dosage though, sorry. I was just trying to share some understanding of methods I knew of if snorting wasn&#039;t an option. Good luck

				I suggest getting your 50 posts in here so you can post in the harm reduction forum and ask that question there instead, lots of experienced users in there who can help you out.

				Given that you haven&#039;t done any opiates in almost a year, it would be safe to say you no longer have any tolerance, so I won&#039;t go into the differences in strength between prescription drugs like Oxycodone, Hydrocodone and other Opiate derivative&#039;s, suffice it to say you should do a google search on Opiate equivalence tables.<br /><br />I prefer to IV my H. The bio availability of H taken via insufflation (snorted) as opposed to IV&#039;ing is less.&nbsp; In other words you get more of the drug by IV&#039;ing it than by snorting it, so doing 10mg or H by snorting it is not the same as doing 10mg by IV.<br /><br />All that being said, it is always safer to start small.&nbsp; I would make a small line of 10mg and snort it.&nbsp; Wait at least 15 minutes before trying more.&nbsp; Do not keep snorting more to try and get a better buzz, if you do too much you will start feeling nauseous and possibly start vomiting.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t do more than 50mg in one sitting the first time.&nbsp; The problem with H is you never know the strength from one batch to the next.&nbsp; So you might get high as a kite on 10mg from one batch and nothing from the second.<br /><br />The most common reasons users OD on H is they get a new batch and take their regular dose, only to discover the new batch is two to three times as strong.&nbsp; So they nod off and stop breathing.<br /><br />Always start small on a new batch, at most 1/4-1/2 of your normal dose.

				Listen to this guy /\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Since you dont have a scale, id say a safe dose by eye would be no more than what would be able to fit on a surface area no bigger than a pencil eraser. Roughly, that would be one small key bump.<br /><br />Wait no less than 15-20 min, to gauge how your feeling. You will know its working if and when you get a mild sense of euphoria. That is the come on of H, it will feel like your dreaming.<br /><br />I suggest sticking to very small key bumps. If you have little to no tolerance, half of your 70mg will have you pretty high. If its real good quality, 35mg with no tolerance will have you borderline nodding. Good luck, be safe.

				Well, I can&#039;t say from experience, but I can give you a logical, &quot;SAFE&quot; way to calculate it.<br />Morphine dose by IV is normally about 10mg for a fairly strong hospital dose.&nbsp; Pure H is considered 2-3 times stronger than morphine, so if you DID get some pure stuff, and did NOT have any tolerance, then you would theoretically only do about 3 to 5 mg for IV.<br />For nasal use, morphine is around 20 percent bio-available.<br />So you need 5 times as much, nasally, as you would need compared to IV.<br />Close to the same with H.<br />So looks like a careful starting dose of morphine HCL would be 40-50 mg, while a starting dose (for PURE H) would be 10-20 mg, if you are certain it&#039;s close to pure.&nbsp; If not, start there and work your way up, allowing enough time for it to fully absorb into the membranes before doing more.<br />If my calculations are off my much, please feel free to correct me.<br />

				sounds good ill probably start small, an eraser head sized bit wait 15 then work my way up if needed. also might take some benadryl first to cut back on the itching and any possible nausea.
