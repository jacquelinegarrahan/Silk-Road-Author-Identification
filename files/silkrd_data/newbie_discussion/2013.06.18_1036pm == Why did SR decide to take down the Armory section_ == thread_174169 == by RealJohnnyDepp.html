				I don&#039;t thing there was enough demand, I don&#039;t think shipping big heavy metal objects is the easiest thing, at least with drugs they can slip by an xray pretty easily.<br /><br />I konw they don&#039;t have a hitman section because that&#039;s some fucked up shit, if you want to pay someone to kill another human, get yourself checked into therapy.

				There is no hitman section because its strictly against the moral code of the road. Have you not read the SR mission statement from DPR?

				In the &#039;about&#039; section it says: &quot;Our basic rules are to treat others as you would wish to be treated, mind your own business, and don&#039;t do anything to hurt or scam someone else. In the spirit of those rules, there are some things you will never see here, and if you do please report them. They include child pornography, stolen goods, assassinations and stolen personal information, just to name a few. We also hold our members to the highest standards of personal conduct and work tirelessly to prevent, root out and stop any scammers that may try to prey upon others. &quot;

				don&#039;t get me wrong... i love &#039;boomsticks&#039; as most people do (just like people like fireworks). but, i don&#039;t own a gun because of a simple statistic... a majority of victims of death from a firearm are the person who pulled the trigger. i love to go with my grandfather and dad and blow away bright orange clay &quot;pigeons&quot; with their shotguns... but i would never want a gun in my possession without supervision. i&#039;d love to hunt these things: http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/22654036/newly-developed-micro-robot-bird-able-to-perform-reconnaissance-surveillance#axzz2WrUkKQUb<br /><br />i do take comfort in knowing i can shoot though... if it comes to it, i can protect my family&amp;friends.<br /><br />my late-fiance came over to find me deepthroating a military issue pistol from WWII (i think). the gun wasn&#039;t loaded, but i was ready to pull the trigger had it been. we stumbled upon it again a few weeks later. i missed a pocket on the holster containing a full clip. if i hadn&#039;t been so oblivious, my brains would have been obliterated.<br /><br />just my two cents.<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				Iv heard that i was because of lack of demand of guns and such but that cant be the problem. I also heard another theory thats more likely and that was that the Government, FBI or whatever Took this very seriously. Terrorism and shit you know how they are about this, got to much attention.
