				Hello,<br /><br />I have an SR account with BTC in from which I want to transfer BTC to another SR account. Will there be any way that the originator account of the BTC will be identifiable/traceable when the BTC arrives in my intended destination account?<br /><br />Thanks

				SR has a bitcoin mix that they use. It would be hard to figure out and I think it would require people snitching for you to get caught.

				I have a bitcoin wallet on my cellphone which I know is not impossible to track but I would imagine very difficult. <br /><br />Definitely more work than a local pd would do to track down my weekend party favors...<br /><br />of course I guess I could be wrong?

BTC transferred that way are not mixed etc., but are instead simply &#039;moved&#039; within the Silk Road internal wallet.<br /><br />If you use the &#039;withdraw&#039; function, then the Bitcoin should be tumbled but I&#039;m not 100% sure on this. If you&#039;re really concerned about it you may want to withdraw your BTC, send it through a tumbler such as BitcoinFog, and then send it to the other SR account deposit address.<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Libertas, that&#039;s really helpful. A follow up question if I may, how does bitcoinfog work? If I make a deposit into my buyer SR account and then withdraw the deposit into bitcoinfog (presumably I set up a wallet within bitcoinfog and then withdraw from SR to that bitcoinfog wallet address - is bitcoinfog safe and is there a charge for its services?-) and then redeposit into my vendor account from my bitcoinfog wallet?<br /><br />Thanks,

We get too many messages from people stating their Bitcoin have left SR but never arrived at their destination, and it is always as a result of user error.<br /><br />You can read more about how BitcoinFog works on their site:<br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br /><br />BitcoinFog have been around for quite some time, but please be aware that ANY site you send your Bitcoin to can abscond with them at ANY time. It is safe insofar as it has established itself as relatively trustworthy, but you have no recourse should they decide to just steal everyone&#039;s Bitcoin as other services have done in the past.<br /><br />blockchain.info also provide a mixing service but you&#039;ll have to check all that out yourself as I&#039;m afriad I don&#039;t have the time to write about it here. All the information is available on their site, and indeed dotted around the Silk Road forums.<br /><br />Libertas
