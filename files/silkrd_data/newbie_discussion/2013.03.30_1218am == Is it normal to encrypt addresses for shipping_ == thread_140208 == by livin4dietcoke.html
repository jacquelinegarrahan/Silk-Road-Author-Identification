				Just wondering if people encrypt their addresses for shipping? I&#039;ve had a few transactions and didn&#039;t encrypt and everything went smoothly. Is encrypting the norm? What&#039;s the best way to do it? I&#039;ve heard of pgp and privnote., I&#039;m not that tech savvy so any help is appreciated. <br />

				Yes. A good rule is to encrypt everything that you would not put on a poster inside the police station.

				It&#039;s an added layer of precaution, yes PGP encryption should be standard protocall, Consider this PGP is Free, Learn it and use it, you would be pissed if ignorance led you to jail , no?<br /><br /><br />SurfinSilly

				absolutely learn to use pgp/gpg and encrypt your address. look at it this way, if any info is ever seized by the authorities, do you want to have your info all in the open so they don&#039;t even have to try and decrypt it? there is a ridiculous amount of people who do not encrypt, close to 50% i&#039;ve heard from different vendors, and if the crackdown shit storm ever hits, they will be the first to get the letters from the government. if you think what you&#039;re doing on here is no big deal, then it&#039;s your own fault if you get caught or do something stupid. spend time reading the forums on PGP/ GPG and learn your shit. bottom line. there&#039;s a really good thread if you search for &quot;command line easy as shit&quot; and you can learn how to use pgp from your terminal application, which is in fact, easier than shit.&nbsp; to answer your question, if you consider yourself responsible, you should have never even thought of sending your address unencrypted

				In my experience as a vendor most people do not encrypt.&nbsp; But should you?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Do you have to?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Should you use privnote?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; PGP?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; If you don&#039;t encrypt will I cancel your order?&nbsp; LOL- no!&nbsp; It is for your protection.

				Here&#039;s an IT professionals point of view......... No, it is not required at all. The TOR network provides main levels of encryption. But having sad that, if your coming down off meth and paranoia is creeping in, then USE PGP MAN!!! Otherwise the popo will be at your door any second.

				If you dont use PGP / GPG , then as soon as you place your order, the DEA will be kicking your door in and forcing a pepperspray-coated baton into your bum.<br /><br />Just take an hour to sit down and learn it. Dont focus on anything else, just do it, you&#039;ll be glad you did. If the road ever got raided you&#039;d be kicking yourself that your address was there in plaintext for any LE to see.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a guide:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/<br /><br />
