				With all this spamming to 50 nonsense I could easily see this happening. It completly devalues the post count system.<br />Any thoughts on the topic of spamming? And don&#039;t spam here, I feel it necessary to say this because it seems you noobs will take any chance they can get.

				New members would be mistaken to think that they can continue to spam beyond the Newbie subforum.&nbsp; Those posts would be deleted as quickly as they were brought to our attention.

				Sorry this is a bit off topic. I really don&#039;t mean to jack your thread but what exactly makes a member a &quot;Hero Member&quot;? What makes a vendor a &quot;Senior Member&quot;?<br />All I know is: Newbie 0-49 posts. For that matter, what&#039;s the range for &quot;Full Member&quot;? My goal in life is basically just to make it to a hero member on the SR forums. Haha. I joke...but only partially.
