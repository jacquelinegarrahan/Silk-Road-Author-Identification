				I&#039;ve checked out localbitcoins, made an account, but I do not know which method of payment I should be using. I&#039;ve seen plenty of bank transfer options, and ways I can get bitcoins via moneygram, etc. But I am very cautious about it. Never made a purchase off the silk road, although I&#039;ve been following it for months now. Am I putting myself at any large risk by transferring money through a bank account via moneygram, or any exchanges such as that? Because to me that seems to be the simplest and quickest way. I have never made a cash deposit before, and I don&#039;t know exactly how to go about doing that. Either way, I&#039;m confused and frustrated as hell. I just want to get my bitcoins onto the silk road. Coming from a newbie, any help would be very fucking appreciated.

				I dont like localbitcoins unless I want bitcoin same day, people tax the hell out of you its ridiculous. I western unioned some money and it cost $40 to send an instant transfer... on top of expensive btc. And im not close to any of the banks to deposit money in so it sucks.<br />&nbsp;Campbx u can money order them and they have really cheap bitcoins. I like coinbase the best, straight outta the bank outta, not very anonymous but FUCK it. Takes 30 days for immediate transfer, otherwise it takes 4 business days.<br /><br />And also, i find it extremely frustrating buying btc too.

				I&#039;ve used local bitcoins a couple of times and its been the smoothest and most reliable way to get coins for me. The easiest way I find is to do a deposit into their bank account. Make sure you keep the receipt the teller gives you incase they try scam you then the admins will step in. <br /><br />All in all it&#039;s usually pretty straight forward.

				It&#039;s quite comfortable in Europe with SEPA-transactions. Isn&#039;t there an easy way for online banking in the USA?

				To help out newbs, I wrote up some methods for buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road. <br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

I use transferwise.com to make cheap bank transfers to other EU countries, banks often still charge a large fee for this.

				I have found Camp BX to be the best way to anonymously purchase bitcoins. You can set up an account with tormail. Use a fake name and buy up to a 1,000 money order. Mail the money order to Camp BX with express mail. Within 48 hours of sending the money order you can now purchase bitcoins well below the current Silk Road rate. And I don&#039;t know if I said this before ;) but its completely anonymous if you do it right!
