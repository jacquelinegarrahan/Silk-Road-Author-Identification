				I am completely new to the Silk Road experience and decided to become a member when drug in my area were being sold in very dangerous conditions. People were bein sold Molly with rc infused in them, fake LSD, and on top of gang violence where people were getting shot and killed just because they were looking for a good time and some greedy low life thought 20 bucks was worth more then a human life. Keep in mind this is in the heart of America. I decided like most of us there had to be a easier and safer way and fortunately for us there&#039;s the Silk Road. After much debate I decide I was going to make 3 purchases small amounts of 3 different drugs from 3 different vendors. I wanted some pure MDMA, LSD, and Ketamine. I decided to start with the MDMA which is what I will do the review on today more to follow late on the other two substances. My research first started on Silk Road itself I nailed 2 vendors down by prices and ratings. Karmapharma stuck out to me because his page seemed very legit and for some reason I felt like I could relate to him on a personal level. I then looked these vendors up on reddit and saw very little about them but the few posts I did find about Karma were just awesome everyone said this guy had fire ass MDMA and was legit. I then decided to try the forums before I made my decision again little about karma but what was said about him was great amazing us vendor with fire ass MDMA for cheap. That was enough for me I hopped on sr and purchased 1 gram on Saturday night. It instantly sunk in that ordering on a Saturday night was going to suck because of the mail not running on Sundays. Oh well. On Sunday morning I went to check my account to see if any progress was made and it still said processing so out of curiousity I went and checked out Karmas page and noticed he had increased his prices overnight and put an update up stating tht he was increasing his prices due to leaving the Silk Road soon and needed the money where he was going. My first reaction was like fuck he was going to cancel my order and make me pay the higher price or is he just going to take all the money he can from people and dip off to the Bahamas for an early retirement! I sent him a message just to confirm everything was ok with my order. He wrote back later that night and very politely assured me everything was goin to be just fine and to expect a little longer time in processing because he was so far back ordered it was going to take a day or two to get caught up. I did feel better but suspicion still laid heavily on my mind. Finally Tuesday it was marked for transit. Friday I go down to check the mail and to my complete happiness I find my little package from Karma. I was so excited I could barely wait to open it. From the outside the stealth was absolutely top notch. On the inside it was even more secure wrapped tightly inside of a personal note from Karma which was the cherry on top. Now down to what everyone is looking forward to hear. I weighed out the product 1.1!!! I then weighed out 300 mg yeah I know a super high dose but go big or go home I always say. I guess I&#039;m missing the description of the product. It was mostly crystals brown in color texture of sand two or three larger chunks and smells like root beer! I took 300 mg and put it into a glass and poured mt dew in it and mixed gently really due to having nothing else to mix it with at the time I would not recommend this to anyone taste like shit! Tonight was my wife&#039;s and I date night and we decide to go bowling I thought it would be fun music tons of ppl! I didn&#039;t tell her I took the MDMA but within 20 minutes as we were about to head out the door the x took over in a major way my pupils were so large they covered my whole eyes and I was just covered in a blanket of love. She knew by the time I walked to the car I was on something lol out of all the x I have ever taken this had the most psychedelic attributes to it my eyes jiggled intensely I couldn&#039;t see straight tons of trails. I am 100 percent sure this was pure MDMA and not cut with anything I just took a huge pure dose. The rest of the night was filled with laughter and love with huge waves of intense body highs washing over me every few minutes. The roll lasted 4 hours and the comedown was extremely gentle and soft actually fell right asleep when we got home. I definitely recommend finding gum. My jaws hurt so bad the next day!! And find some 5-http to help cope with the Monday blues. Overall experience was amazing and I still have a bunch left over!! Karma is a Silk Road hero

				yeah he&#039;s got great stuff, it&#039;s just a bummer he can&#039;t get his pgp figured out because I won&#039;t order without it. for the blues and the neurotoxicity with mdma, preload with 5htp and immediately after, and during. and also take antioxidants, alpha lipoic acid, selenium, vit c. stuff like that. there is a really good article on erowid about how antioxidants have proven to prevent neurotoxicity and also tolerance, along with 5htp. considering those are the most detrimental things about mdma, it&#039;s pretty bitchin that taking the right vitamins (which should be taken on a regular basis anyways) help to eliminate not only the dangerous side effects but also the tolerance. good luck! also, 2c-b is said to be a magical addition to the end of an mdma trip.. something to consider

				PotLuver awesome bro! You won&#039;t regret it I promise and Ralph thank you man so much for that little tid bit of info I did find the article on erowid and I am reading it now. Always good to have fellow Silk Roaders that care enough about the community to put things like that out in the open.
