				I just tried using the search feature but became impatient as sometimes it feels like I am using dial-up internet when on TOR. lol. It&#039;s okay, I understand why, though, but maybe somebody here can help me --<br /><br />I am a new member to SR, haven&#039;t made any transactions yet, but if and when I do, I intend to buy opiates. I am not totally picky about what exactly the product is. Basically, can somebody else here who enjoys opiates and has experience getting them off the Road maybe recommend a GOOD seller with decently fair prices, who would be willing to work with me even though I am new. I don&#039;t want to have to like, buy some weed or whatever just to get a few transactions under my belt. I get that with ease locally, and I would honestly be more nervous about mailing that shit than any kind of powder.<br /><br />I found a vendor while browsing who I am very interested in buying from, who actually also sells BitCoin himself via Reloadit card. If he didn&#039;t have such great feedback and reviews, I would be skeptical. Any advice?

				It&#039;s up to you. <br /><br />Depending on where you&#039;re from, there are many ways to get bitcoins, if that&#039;s your issue.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just trying to get some transactions under your belt than just buy a bunch of stuff on SR. <br />They do sell more than just drugs on that site, ya know.

				The best sellers that I have found are Modziw and Peels4u<br /><br />Both are super nice, have great prices and selection, and are willing to work with us newbies!<br /><br />Just shoot them a message over on SR and introduce yourself to break the ice. Tell em SorenBowie referred ya :)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/14845f6687 - Modziw<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/37f8d19139 - Peels4U<br /><br />good luck!!

				Yeah, they sell Art, Books, Collectibles, Forgeries... and even MONEY? etc <br /><br />I joined SR for one reason, and one reason alone. You and I both probably already know what that is. If that cannot be achieved with relative ease, I can just do things the old fashioned way ... shame to miss all the mouth-watering looking shit available via the SR though. Oh well<br /><br />edit: thank you Bowie, I am assuming they mainly sell just ... pharmaceutical-ish things. Those are nice but I have my eyes set on a different type of opiate :) but thank you for your recommendations anyway
