				&nbsp;I&#039;d really like some advice on some new treats to try.&nbsp; <br /><br />Something I&#039;m already loving about SR is the large menu that&#039;s on offer. So many things&nbsp; to choose from. Which is great, because there&#039;s a few things I&#039;ve always wanted to try, but never been able to source in the real world. LSD is top of my to-do list. <br />But I must admit, I don&#039;t really know what a lot of the substances on sale, actually are. <br /><br />I&#039;m very familiar with weed and opiates, and I enjoy these very much.<br />I&#039;ve also had a fair few E&#039;s in my time, but I never really enjoyed the speedy side of ecstasy. I prefer down, rather than up. If that makes sense(?). <br /><br />However, I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the initial euphoric rush when coming up on an E. The warm body shock sensation, eyes rolling around in my head, like being cuddled by the devil, beautiful.<br /><br />But I do NOT enjoy, the speedy sensation that comes after. Grinding my teeth, sweating, restlessness etc.. <br /><br />So now to my question (finally, I hear you cry) .. <br /><br />I want something that will give me sustained euphoria, but without the whizz crap after.<br /><br />If I could pick n&#039; mix effects from the drugs I&#039;m familiar with in order to create my perfect high, these would be the (only) ingredients.. <br />Strong sustained euphoria + weed couchlock + mild visuals = my magic all in one weekend pill.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />People of Silk Road, what dost thou suggest? <br />

You&#039;ve come to the right place. Seriously, good Molly should be way chiller than what you&#039;ve described, if you keep your dosage modest at least. <br /><br />Have you considered ketamine? A trippy anesthetic I haven&#039;t personally tried but from everything I&#039;ve heard, it sounds right up your alley. <br /><br />You could also try taking some hallucinogen with an opiate. The more spiritually-minded tripsters would discourage this, but I&#039;ve always thought it sounded like a neat idea.

				Yeah ketamine or MXE is a perfect match for what your after. More likely MXE as its longer lasting and not so intense when you keep the doses sensible. ;P

				Well, the kind of mdma you&#039;re looking for is that canadian brown sand stuff. You can fall asleep while rolling on it if you need to, it&#039;s that good and pure. I don&#039;t even feel any jaw tension when I take it though the eyes might wiggle if I dosed on the higher side. <br /><br />As for other sustained euphoric (and non-stimmy) drugs, we&#039;re talking a low dose of shrooms or lsd. 3.5g of gandiloi or 150ug of lsd are decent euphoria doses for me.
