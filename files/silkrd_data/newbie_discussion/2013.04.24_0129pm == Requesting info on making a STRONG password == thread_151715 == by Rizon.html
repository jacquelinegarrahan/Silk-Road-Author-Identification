				Create a phrase - include numbers and punctuation and ensure it is memorable to you. With the phrase complete choose every third and fifth character (or whatever). The passphrase that emerges should be strong ... providing pretty good protection :)<br />

				Password length is better than anything else.&nbsp; Using special characters doesnt really do much anymore.&nbsp; So create a sentence you can remember, and use it. <br /><br />Something like:<br /><br />MyFavoriteSongIsFromtheBeatles.

				Hello<br /><br />giving advice on how someone creates a password would be the first step to render someones password weaker ^^<br /><br />i know that doesnt help you much but i hope it will at least help someone not giving out any advice ;)<br />sry for that dude but im sure you can be smart enough to come up with your own technics <br /><br />a first thing you can do is search google for some freely avaible password lists and be sure to NOT pick one of those <br />also read on how bruteforce methods works and try to understand how to create a password wich would be harder to get bruteforced afterwards

				1. don&#039;t use words that can be found in the dictionary. foreign words and unusual proper names are fine. don&#039;t use dates or names under any circumstances.<br /><br />2. take the first letter of a sentence to get a good random chunk of letters that you can remember. Something like &quot;that damned junky faggot stole my erect penis and sold it on the black market&quot; becomes &quot;tdjfsmepasiotbm&quot; - very hard to guess.<br /><br />3. Salt your password. That means, throw some shit in there in the middle. So if your password is konkrete it you can make it konkshittingdicknippleskrete.<br /><br />4. Use unusual characters and substitute letters for weird characters. konkrete becomes kön|&lt;r3t3.<br /><br />5. make it long. each letter makes it exponentially more difficult to hack.<br /><br />6. take advantage of caps if the password is caps sensitive, but do it in an unusual way that would be difficult to guess.

				I use the following trick to generate strong password but that I can easily recover: (on mac osx or linux)<br /><br />- On the command line, I generate a md5 checksum for the name of the site + some salt (a random string, but always the same so I can remember).<br /><br />For example (where Yo is the salt)<br /><br />$ md5&lt;enter&gt;<br />silkroadYo&lt;enter&gt;<br />29b3adf5145e3d0b726a1800a50db0ec&lt;enter&gt;<br />&lt;ctrl-d&gt;<br /><br />- To make this even stronger, I replace some characters (which are all in the 0-9a-f range) with other characters.<br /><br />$ md5 | tr abc XYZ&lt;enter&gt;<br />silkroadYo&lt;enter&gt;<br />&lt;ctrl-d&gt;<br />29Y3Xdf5145e3d0Y726X1800X50dY0eZ<br /><br />- The length might be exaggerated, so I shorten it:<br /><br />$ md5 | tr abc XYZ | head -c 12&lt;enter&gt;<br />silkroadYo&lt;enter&gt;<br />29Y3Xdf5145e&lt;enter&gt;<br />&lt;ctrl-d&gt;<br /><br />- This I can remember or just regenerate whenever I need it, since I know the sitename, the salt and the replacement strings.<br /><br /><br />

				Once you get past a few characters, the presence or absence of special characters, numbers, caps, etc don&#039;t really matter.&nbsp; Pick 4 random words that mean something to you, in an order you can remember. xkcd said it best<br />http://xkcd.com/936/
