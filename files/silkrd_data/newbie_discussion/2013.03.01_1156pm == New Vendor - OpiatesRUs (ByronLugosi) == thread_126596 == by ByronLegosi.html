				Hi all,<br /><br />We&#039;ve just opened our vending account on here. We&#039;ve been buying for some time (on a different and obviously undisclosed account) <br />so we know the site well but we&#039;re new to selling on here.<br /><br />We&#039;re a team of two who have both been selling via other sites and word of mouth for well over 2 years now and finally thought we&#039;d enjoy the relative safety of SR so I fronted the cash and here we are.<br /><br />We sell mainly opiates though I do very nice MD but at not that cheap a prices. Tough. It&#039;s great quality and our rep will eventually prove it worth it =D<br /><br />Anyway, we&#039;ve only had 2 orders (sent out but abroad so not arrived) and 2 trials (also sent) so not much to go on yet but please do get in touch with questions etc and we look forward to dealing with you on a more vendor/customer level!<br /><br />Check us out: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8535dfb154<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Byron Lugosi<br /><br />p.s. a free 100mg MST for the first person to correctly get our names reference and why we might use it via PM on the marketplace.<br /><br />p.p.s Forum username spelling is a purpose injoke, that&#039;s not a clue or the answer ^ lol

				Am placing this here aswell as in the other thread. Can&#039;t seem to find an oxy/opiate dealer thread which would be helpful as tried nearly all of the UK ones and some of them are superb. Anyways copy and pasted below:<br /><br />I recently made a purchase with ByronLugosi and wanted to review this new vendor on account of another great experience on the road&nbsp; ;D Made a few reviews recently from opioid dealers and some have been so good, that I want to regularly purchase from them ;) Luckily they more or less have different inventories! Can&#039;t complain as great to have choices out there and am regular buyer so always good to have options...<br /><br />Firstly I&#039;m very glad I took a chance on this vendor and am sure you will too!<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it, it doesn&#039;t feel like the biggest risk re getting scammed with brand new vendor as they&#039;ve paid the bond to secure the account (thanks SR admin! lol) BUT it is a risk in sense of security and product -which in my opinion is the MOST important. There were none of these problems with this vendor and can recommend him to others without hesitation.<br /><br />I like vendors that will put the same effort into domestic as they would international as it&#039;s easy to get complacent! We all have a very limited amounts of drops and our ability to continue buying on SR fully depends on keeping them safe...<br /><br />Comms 5/5 - Instant responses, very knowledgeable about their product, but most of all is a real pleasure to deal with! Made it a very smooth,easy and friendly transaction. Top marks here and hope it continues once gets more busy! This vendor is also very open to suggestions and would suggest you get in touch if have any questions or requests.<br /><br />Delivery and Stealth 5/5 - Perfect! I placed my order at 1655 and was posted by 1710!! Amazingly fast and stealth was fine for domestic too!! I take security very seriously and have no worries purchasing from this vendor. Saying that, it&#039;s always good to keep adapting/improving methods and am sure this vendor will be doing this ;)<br /><br />Product 5/5 - This vendor has a really good variety of stock and would seem to get hold of some of the much rarer items like diamorphine vials for example! I don&#039;t inject but can see this would be very appealing for someone that wants 100% pure guaranteed!! Byron put together a &#039;surprise&#039; mixed bag listing for me as a first purchase and what a nice surprise it was!! I got combo of MST&#039;s (a great price on SR! Some vastly over-inflate their prices on here) and tried the oxylan which I&#039;d never seen before but came recommended and at the price it&#039;s being sold at, worked well and am sure will sell. Perhaps a little info on whether coating needs to be removed would be helpful as difficult to find any info on this brand (blistered and legit tho). If anything they gave me more of a gouch than the Napps which I find are a little more of a stimulating buzz, so great for those that like to get their &#039;nod&#039; on.<br /><br />Everything arrived in original blister packaging and you can feel confident you will be getting an original and pharmaceutical grade product! Top marks here and look forward to seeing what comes next in the inventory!!<br /><br />Overall 5/5 - Top marks for this new vendor! I enjoyed this hassle free transaction and would definitely recommend giving ByronLugosi a chance! The UK opiate scene has exploded on SR somewhat over the last few weeks which is great for us buyers and keeps prices down and vendors from getting complacent :) There are some very good vendors out there that really absorb the sprit of SR and how it should function. ByronL appears to be one of those vendors and hope it continues. Wish you the best of luck with your new shop!

				My care package arrived safe and sound. took awhile but I was prepared for that being as it was coming from abroad. <br /><br />First off, Let me thank Byron Lugosi for a great transaction. Communication with this vendor was top notch. <br /><br />I was under the impression that I would be receiving a 100mg Napp brand Morphine Sulfate and a generic benzo. To my surprise, I was gifted TWO 100 mg MST&#039;s and 2 generic benzos. That was an awesome surprise! So thanx brother<br /><br />The wares are exactly as described and were in their little blister packs. Packaging was spot on as well. No worries for customs checking if you are purchasing somewhere other than locally. <br /><br />So all in all, this vendor takes pride in their business and has some great oroducts for competitive pricing. If you are in the US, don&#039;t hesitate to PM Byron and get an order placed. You won&#039;t have any problems. I am glad to have met another quality vendor with great wares. I know where I&#039;ll be going when I need some more Napp brand morphine. They were amazing and really helped kill my leg pain for a few days. <br /><br />There are a handful of quality opiate vendors on the RD and we can safely add Byron to the mix. Drop him a line and see what the fuss is about. You&#039;ll be glad you did.
