				Little background personality wise, I am more or less emotionally numb. Not gone just locked away to the point that I can no longer access them. What would be good drugs for introspection and unlocking your heart so to speak? I was thinking LSD but I would like to hear from experienced trippers. I am new to drugs btw.<br /><br />One other question I have is, which you may want to PM me with your suggestions, how would I go about receiving said medicinal&#039;s anonymously? I was thinking of sending it to a persons mailbox then grabbing the package before&nbsp; they get up, but thats the extent of my imagination. Thanks in advance for any assistance/advice.

				These are both great questions. I may know a little about what you are saying emotionally. <br /><br />MDMA or ecstasy are both good, as well as mushrooms. Being inexperienced with drugs just means you need to test the waters before going all in. Start with a small amount and concentrate on what you are feeling. I don&#039;t recommend doing them alone, it&#039;s nice to be able to share them with someone whom you trust and are close to. It doesn&#039;t have to be sexual or freaky, can just be a buddy that you are close to and can talk about what the drugs are making you feel like. Makes for good bonding with someone.<br /><br />My only recommendation is you use a name that is actually associated with the address. The flag is using a name that is not a resident, the post office picks up on that almost immediately. That doesn&#039;t mean it still won&#039;t make it to your address, but they may notice the 5th or 6th different name at an address and get suspicious. <br /><br />Hope this information helps you on your journey, my friend.

				MDMA/ecstasy could definitely help your emotions come out, if only for a few hours. I second the recommendation to have people around while you trip, both for safety purposes in case you do happen to have an adverse effect, and to truly experience the extreme love/empathy towards others that ecstasy tends to bring out, even towards people that you don&#039;t really care for.<br /><br />Personally, LSD makes me see pretty colors and makes me really talkative but doesn&#039;t really affect my emotions or make me introspective. I&#039;ve only taken weak doses, though. Read up on some experience reports on erowid.com if you haven&#039;t already to get a feel for what reactions people typically have.<br /><br />Have you considered DMT? There&#039;s a movie called DMT: The Spirit Molecule that you could try watching to see if the drug could be useful for you. It&#039;s a powerful hallucinogenic that many people say has changed their lives for the better. <br />

I would recommend tho having some valium around to take if you&#039;re having a bad trip on LSD to bring it to an end otherwise you&#039;ll be waiting hours for the effects to wear off.

				Well thank you for all of the suggestions, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be using any weed, I&#039;d like for the drugs to be out of my system in 3-4 day in case there is a surprise piss test at work.

				Get some MDMA and big bag of weed. <br /><br />If you&#039;re *completely* inexperienced with drugs, then I&#039;d steer clear of LSD for the time being. Not exactly a gentle introduction. lol<br /><br />As for anonymous delivery, just order to your home address with your real name. Vendors put a lot of effort into making their packages blend in with the millions of other items in the postal system.<br />A bag of weed and a little powder won&#039;t be a problem at all.

				Always use encryption and always use your real address and real name.... unless you live with mom and pop and can&#039;t guarantee being there.&nbsp; Even so, would they open your mail?&nbsp; As for getting your head straight.&nbsp; Two ways:&nbsp; One, take a trip somewhere, see some old friends, take a walk in the woods.&nbsp; Or two:&nbsp; Take a one day acid trip, or take too much of anything, so that you&#039;re scared into taking this thing more seriously.&nbsp; Drugs need to be managed with discipline, or they will manage you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Only three more posts until nirvana!

				I don&#039;t want to offend anyone but the guys saying use my own address and name are LE correct? If they are I have a question for them as well. Why are drugs that have little to no harmful physiological effects(compared to alcohol) so highly attacked/prosecuted? Ex. LSD, Shrooms, Weed.

				short answers: alcohol is illegal because of the crazy shit that went down during prohibition money. tobacco tax makes the gov too much money. weed went down when it was associated with hemp in the cotton competition and it stayed illegal because of propaganda. After MKULltra the gov decides psychedelics are useless and use it to attack the counter culture. wanted &gt; functioning members of society

				LSD lasts far to long if your inexperienced. If you dont like it or it doesnt agree with you your going to have a long possibly painful time.<br /><br />DMT is very short but extremely intense. My experience of it has been incredible and really beautiful, but I would consider myself a pretty comfortable emotionally aware person. I would imagine that if you werent it could give you some pretty intense realisations..that you may not like!<br /><br />In all seriousness though mate...If you consider yourself to have emotional troubles I would strongly suggest going to speak to some sort of therapist rather than trying to find the answer in substances. Hallucinogenics can be pretty intense and even drugs like weed can cause negative psychological effects if taken by the wrong person or in the wrong frame of mind :)
