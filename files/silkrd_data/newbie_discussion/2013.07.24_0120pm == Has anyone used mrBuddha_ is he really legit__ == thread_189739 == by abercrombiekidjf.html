				i tried out mrBuddha for the first time over 30 hrs ago and at first he answered me all the time, i see he is having problems family wise on his end, but i wanted to see if anyone has had success because the forum reviews on him are so small but he has almost 170 trans. so i was wondering if anyone had any feedback whatsoever cause i havent heard back from him at all in a day now and im not sure what is going on. thanks you for all responses!

				I tried him aswel today like one hour ago we&#039;ll see how fast he does it. On his profile he updated it with saying money orders will take less than 12 hours so..

				I&#039;m starting to get very worried. Sent a $525 MP... his profile says 12 hours and he has been responsive on PMs.. however, if he is truly processing orders throughout this 12 hours then wouldn&#039;t there be more review showing up?<br /><br />Smells fishy. Hope I didn&#039;t lose $525

				I did a moneypak--&gt;Bitcoin transaction with that cocksmoker while he was just starting his scam. He built up stats/processed valid transactions, and now you might as well stick your moneypak up your ass instead of sending it to that piece of shit. It&#039;s a risky transaction to begin with, but when &quot;hero members&quot; and vendors are recommending him, It&#039;s hard to avoid. You have been warned, and should find this post because you did a vendor name search in the forums (right?), before you did any business with him. When I searched his name, there were no issues like this, I hope this helps some of you keep your cash. I lost $700 but some people have lost thousands!!

				I heard several thread about him being a scammer. If you want to get btc fast, there are other trusted vendors that would sell you btc for moneypak or RELoadit card

				I say use trading sites and launder the coins yourself. It takes longer but you wont get screwed by someone whos just trying to get themselves some bitcoins. I have been using trading sites since I got to SR and havent laundered the coins yet but have purchased without incident. I am gonna start looking into ways of cleaning the coins myself. Im pretty sure though that SR launders the coins before they are deposited onto the site and before they are withdrawn back to your wallet. If I&#039;m wrong on that fact let me know..... <br /><br />Everything in the bitcoin world takes time. When you try to rush it is when you make hasty decisions like finalizing early or purchasing bitcoins from people without any reputation and thats when your gonna lose money. Good luck, I hope you get your coins.

				THIS is why I&#039;m so opposed to getting Bitcoins this way. I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t legit Bitcoin vendors on Silk Road. I know there are because I&#039;ve bought from them in the past. But I&#039;ve ALWAYS felt uneasy about it, no matter how well trusted the vendor was.<br /><br />Operating outside escrow is INHERENTLY RISKY!
