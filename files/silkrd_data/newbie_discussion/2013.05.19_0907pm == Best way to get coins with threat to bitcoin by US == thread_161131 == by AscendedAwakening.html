				I was curious what is the easiest and best way to get bitcoins, I used bitfloor in the past and it was very easy but sadly they got shut down by the facists so now I need to find a similar anonymous way to get coins. blue Star traders or whatever there name is isn&#039;t accepting orders until the 24th. What do you all recommend? I don&#039;t want to use Mt. gox or Bitinstant personally.

				Hi, Ascended.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious about this too.&nbsp; I read that Mt. Gox is under investigation by the U.S. feds.&nbsp; Should Mt.&nbsp; Gox be avoided completely, and are people who have invested BTC with them at risk?

Also I feel like its a really large trading site thats probably watched along with mt. gox. I&#039;ve never used them but I have a few questions for you Jasmine13 did you stay anonymous getting your coins with Bitinstant or did you have to show ID and how did you deposit the cash to pay for the coins at a bank or some other kind of store?

				Bitstamp is good, never use Mt.Gox.&nbsp; You can get bitcoins via anonymous methods via CamBX but it&#039;s much slower than bitinstant, it takes a week. Bitstamp is relly good because you can access it over tor as well. To have anonymous bitcoins, it&#039;s important to only access your bitcoin wallets (or anything related to bitcoins) through tor or with an anonymous computer (ie a computer that isn&#039;t yours, like in a public library). Don&#039;t go to bitinstant&#039;s website with your own computer as well, everything has to be done on another computer!<br /><br />Bitfloor was amazing, too bad they went down. Lucky for me, I&#039;d bought enough coins when they were still up to last me a pretty long while :) I use bitstamp for trading now instead of bitfloor (trading is a good way to get more coins, keep that in mind).

				Bitinstant. People only had problems for a week and I had bought coins at that time. I was able to reclaim them instantly when I emailed them. Super easy. As long as you save all your transaction numbers you will be fine. Good luck

				Okay guys im going to use bitinstant. Does anyone know a good how-to guide for using bitinstant or is it relatively straight forward? I used to use bitfloor and that was super easy just went to bank filled out slip it was in your bitfloor account and then you bought coins. Also is it best to only access bitinstant on tor?

It would suck if you changed your SR number while you were in transit to transfer but that would be so nubby haha

				The dangerous part of SR is not buying bitcoins, it is receiving the packages. That&#039;s where people should be putting their brains to work. I read somewhere on the forums a guy saying to never put your real name, since you would be signing your crime. I mean, of course mail is public and anyone can send anyone anything in the mail. But having your name attached to an envelope containing drugs is not that easy to explain if it is intercepted. So I think we should be using a different address for delivery or a plausible different name, but not so strange that would get your package missing. A good example: name of the last person who rented your place. But i think that depends on which country you&#039;re in. Where I am, mail workers don&#039;t give a fuck to the name. They simply deliver it and go away.

For example, you buy BTC from bitinstant and have them sent to your SR current address, and then before they get into SR you go and change it... I think after funds are already in SR there&#039;s no way to lose them by changing your coin address.

				Bitinstant is best if you are in a hurry, usually takes less than an hour, unless theres a run on bitcoins and everybody and their brother tries to buy them again&nbsp; :p<br /><br />i go to bitinstant on my laptop @ mcdonalds then have money deposited into mt gox account (in another name, never seen my ip) from there i can buy bitcoins and transfer to myself.&nbsp; alternatively you could have bitinstant send coins directly to your silkroad bitcoin wallet, havent tried this yet, but i will be this week&nbsp; =)
