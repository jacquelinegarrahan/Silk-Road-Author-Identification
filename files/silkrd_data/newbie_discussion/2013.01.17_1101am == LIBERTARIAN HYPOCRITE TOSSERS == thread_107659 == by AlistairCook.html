				I feel like you are missing the crucial essence of my point.<br /><br />Please do explain to me what you mean by free speech and how it fits in to your view of libertarianism.<br /><br />This is obviously not my property, I believe DPR holds that deed. I figured you would get the point.<br /><br />This website is a business, SR gets a commission AFAIK. In a perfect libertarian world, I could build a business on my land and make any form of ridiculous rule I wanted for potential customers. As long as I was not stealing from them or harming them(physical harm, not &#039;Oh I am so damaged by being required to post 50 times) then I would be within my right. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see how I am conservative. <br />You are free to ramble about how unfair it is, and SR is free to do whatever they want(minus the stealing or harming). <br /><br /><br />In your conception of libertarianism and free speech, is it wrong for SR mods to ban spammers?

				so now libertarianism is not compatible with online censorship?<br /><br />So are they mutually exclusive, as in we can&#039;t even get angry at a libertarian for choosing to censor on his site?<br />or&nbsp; does personal freedom supersede a person&#039;s property rights. In your view online property not being real property?

				Here&#039;s the deal : <br /><br />LIBERALISM, later re-branded to LIBERTArianism, is a political philosophy built around LIBERTY.&nbsp; It is NOT a political philosophy whose main concern is PROPERTY. The focus of LIBERTARIANISM is LIBERTY. That shouldn&#039;t bee too hard to grasp, would it bee not.<br /><br />Now, it&#039;s true that property is a key element of libertarian philosophy but it&#039;s not the bee all end all of it. <br /><br />If we&nbsp; are going to get all lawyer-like about property anyways, notice that this forum and SR exist in a network created by the *us government* (I mean Tor). And notice that dpr is just a drug dealer who gets extraordinary benefits thanks to...government regulations (aka prohibition). This is a black market, run inside a government network, not a free market. <br /><br />The OP has a point about the contradictions of people who claim to be libertarians. <br /><br />bottom line :&nbsp; you can use your property in stupid ways or in ways that are not consistent with libertarian principles. But, the mere fact of being a property owner does not make you a libertarian. <br /><br />&quot;I could build a business on my land and make any form of ridiculous rule I wanted for potential customers. &quot;<br /><br />And you would hardly qualify as a libertarian.<br /><br /><br />

				Just because the govt funded a network does not mean that they own the private services therin.. this is the non-indexed Internet for gods sake.. at the end of the day SR is DPR&#039;s gig, to do with as he pleases.. otherwise would the feds let it survive?

				Liberalism and Libertarianism are not synonymous, sorry kiddo. <br />I will go out on a limb, someone please correct me if I am wrong, that all libertarians are liberals but not vice versa.<br /><br />You have an extraordinary ability of avoiding my requests for clarification.<br /><br />Yes this is a black market run by a person who AFAIK believes in libertarian ideals.<br /><br />With the quote on building a business on my land, that is meant to be in a libertarian nation. Of course owning a business doesn&#039;t make me a libertarian, sorry I wasn&#039;t clear. <br /><br />You are making a fundamental error in that you think libertarianism means you have all these inherent freedoms(natural rights) that cannot be squelched. <br /><br />Here :<br />libertarianism |ˌlibərˈte(ə)rēəˌnizəm|<br />noun<br />an extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens.<br /><br />A big focus on property rights and minimal STATE INTERFERENCE. DPR and SR are not a state. This is a business and a market which you are lucky to use. Hence my being able to make any rules I want for you to use my business in a libertarian state. Yes this may be illegal in the current state of the world, but I hardly see how that matter or how imposing a 50 post newbie limit infringes on your freedom as a libertarian. <br /><br />I feel like you would complain if a libertarian in a libertarian state refused you access to their land/business/etc. , you would be like oh man you aren&#039;t letting me be free...<br /><br />I just don&#039;t see what is so complicated. Why do people always argue without knowing about what they are arguing... about<br /><br />I recommend you read Anarchy,State and Utopia by Robert Nozick for a clearer understanding of libertarianism. Stay away from Ayn Rand...

				Libertarianism as commonly understood is the idea that human interaction should be mostly (entirely?) voluntary.<br /><br />Government censorship is obviously not voluntary, so it violates libertarianism. <br /><br />However, private censorship is consistent with a voluntary society, since people can choose whether or not they engage with the owner. If I create a rule in my house that you can&#039;t smoke, or that you can&#039;t wear clothes, or that you must sing all sentences, or that you cannot speak German on Tuesdays... then that is my prerogative as the owner, and other people can *voluntarily* decide whether they want to enter my house and follow my rules. <br />

				The site owner owns this forum, therefore he gets to say what goes on here. You could make your own, and not censor anything. That would be your right.<br /><br />That&#039;s basic libertarian ideology. You can do whatever you want in your own world. You don&#039;t have to subject yourself to this site. That&#039;s your choice.
