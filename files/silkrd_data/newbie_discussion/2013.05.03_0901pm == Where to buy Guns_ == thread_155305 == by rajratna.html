				The fact that you want to buy a gun through the darkweb doesn&#039;t sit well.&nbsp; Buy a gun legally or don&#039;t buy one at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s things like this that are going to make all guns illegal one day.

				Typical americans... He doesn&#039;t live in America if he is looking for a gun. Check me or CherryFlavor out on BMR, were the only vendors on the darknet with proven feedback and success on shipments. I currently have 3 firearms available for sale, and should have some more up next week. I offer full escrow, Cherry used to offer full escrow but now require FE due to the turbulent BTC price (Since they have required FE people have still received goods. Cherry has shipped 40+firearms so far).<br /><br />Cheers

				Raj, the gun show people are referring to is something that they don&#039;t have in your country.&nbsp; A gun show doesn&#039;t involve brandishing a weapon, it is an event where many vendors bring guns to sell.&nbsp; In the USA, we have them often in many places, although some places don&#039;t allow them due to stigma of firearms (bad press from individual acts).<br /><br />Your best bet to find a gun in India is to go to the police, who also control the licensing department.&nbsp; You apply there and they will do a background check to see if you have any previous criminal records, both local and national. If your background check is satisfactory, they will schedule you an appointment with the licensing office and you will be interviewed.&nbsp; During this interview they will ask you questions about why you want a gun, and you have to provide a valid reason.&nbsp; Luckily, self defense is considered a valid reason. Once you pass this interview, you will be given your license, then you can go to a legal dealer and purchase a firearm, where they will check your license to make sure you are legally allowed to purchase a gun.&nbsp; You can also buy directly from a factory that manufactures firearms, but the requirement is still that you must possess a valid license first.<br /><br />I think most pistols sold in India are small caliber- .22 and .32, or you can get a hunting rifle like a .315 or a .30-06, or you can get a shotgun 12 ga.&nbsp; A shotgun is great for home defense because you will stop whatever you hit, but since the projectiles are small, soft, and spread the force of the propellant over the multiple projectiles, they are less likely to overpenetrate through a wall and accidentally kill someone on the other side.&nbsp; For protection while you are out and about, you would need a handgun, as a shotgun is difficult to carry around while performing tasks and it&#039;s harder to aim a long barrel at someone that is close to you than to point a handgun at someone. Against an unarmored target (most civilians don&#039;t walk around with body armor on) a .22 and a .32 will kill someone equally dead as long as you hit something vital. Head, heart, lungs will all receive enough damage from either caliber to put an end to whatever your assailant thought he was going to do to you.<br /><br />I am uncertain as to whether you can purchase large caliber handguns in India, but they would likely be very expensive. A .22 pistol would cost you just under&nbsp; &nbsp;र44000, a .32 pistol would cost र86000

				Sorry for no updates, I have been very busy fulfilling orders since I got back from my last vacation and I am going on another in a couple of days before I am back for a while. <br /><br />Since than:<br />- 5 successful gun deliveries (100% rate), 2 to the UK, 2 to AUS, and 1 to Germany<br />- Several successful (100% rate) ammo deliveries, all over<br /><br />Now:<br />- 2 Brand new G19s (1 Gen2 1 Gen4) <br />- Brand new AR-15<br />- Romanian AK47 <br />- Marlin .22LR sniper<br /><br />Now the unfortunate news, most of those firearms are already reserved :P <br /><br />Send me a PM on BMR if interested in anything.<br /><br />News for my SR account:<br />- Spore prints are sold out<br />- Fake IDs coming soon: Just $90 a ID (Cheapest on SR by a good percentage), come with full security features. The template is perfect, I hired a friend to do the job who is OCD and has killer tech skills (He does tech art for fun using Photoshop etc), and put triple digit hours into the template. Group discounts start at only 3 IDs! <br />- Commercial weed should be available ~2-3 weeks. Sorry about the delay, have had some issues<br /><br /><br />Cheers, <br />Grass4Cash (I swear, I have been doing all the work. My partner needs to kick it up a bit :P)

				Surprised i haven&#039;t seen it yet or maybe i just missed it but ... 3D printers, its not myth anymore and its legit as for BMR they really need to get more users and vendors on over there, a couple gun listings are not enough to draw the crowds. <br /><br />I believe that the armory should&#039;ve stayed, it was perfect, not directly on SR so LE doesn&#039;t go after the whole site for just guns and still operational at doing its business. But man i&#039;ve seen some crazy shit for sale on BMR...slaves once i think... anyway<br /><br />its a good idea to have a gun, especially if you&#039;re in America, you be surprised how scary its getting in some places, DHS just bought enough bullets to shoot every citizen 3-4 times...I&#039;m keeping my gun real close.

				In some areas of the USA, certain guns are illegal but most PARTS of those guns are not.&nbsp; For legal and regulatory purposes, only one part of a gun -- the lower receiver -- is considered a &quot;firearm&quot; and thus subject to regulation.&nbsp; Every other gun part is just a hunk of metal, as far as the law is concerned.&nbsp; You can buy and sell those all day long -- no serial numbers, no paperwork, no licensing, nothing.&nbsp; As you can imagine, this creates additional options for people with some mechanical skills.<br /><br />Are the laws similar in other countries, where guns are more tightly restricted?&nbsp; Is every PART of every gun illegal?

				Ahhh I see, that is why most firearm vendors send them seperated into the different parts. But this is interesting, I definitely want a gun soon, as I am in my early tewnties and starting to wake up to the world.

				Thats not why the parts are shipped in different packages, its for stealth reasons. I offer 100% guaranteed arrival in any country in the world (excluding some asian/african countries), including Australia! My shipping will be the most stealth you have ever seen. <br /><br />As for firearms: The US is the easiest place to obtain a firearm (legally) in the world. However, in places such as the UK/AUS/Most of EU, purchasing a firearm (Specifically a handgun) is illegal in most circumstances.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 2 recent vendors on BMR have started to offer firearms (Bocca and GunRunner). I would NOT use either one of them, as they both as you to FE at least the shipping escrow ($100) before hand. If you want to purchase a firearm, dont be cheap. Just because they charge $1000 less doesn&#039;t make them a good deal, because you will receive nothing. Stick with me or Cherry&nbsp; and you will get exactly what you ordered :)<br /><br />Im on my vacation, but as soon as I am back expect several new offerings.<br /><br />Cheers

				Its not as simple as just printing a liberator. You do realize it costs ~$5000 to get a 3D printer, so why would you spend that much to make some shitty pistols (Thats what they are frankly, if I decide to make/sell those it would be for around $300 a piece). <br /><br />And suppressors are difficult to obtain in the US even, as your fingerprints have to be sent into the ATF among deep back round searches etc etc. They are really only effective on .22LR&#039;s as well, the CIA/other covert groups all use glocks/berettas chambered in .22LR in order to achieve the silence required. A 9mm or high caliber will have reduced noise, but still somewhat audible. Nojollyroger on BMR offers .22LR suppressors and rifle suppressors for sale.

				Wow, is a 3D printer really only around 5 grand?? How much would enough materials to print say an AR-15 be?? Is there any good source of information if I were interested in learning more about the basic fundamentals of 3D gun printing??

				Ah I see Jack, are you saying the cheaper one&#039;s parts do that, or 3D gun printing technology has not reached a point to be worthit at all unless its for like a 1 time hit or some shit? Just wondering what all the hype is about gun printing if this is true.

				Thanks for the info, as I do not know much of 3D printing but I wrongly automatically assumed we would have the tech to be able to achieve high density metal printing, Im sure its not too far away, and would be more expensive but think of the money you would make from probably relatively inexpensive raw material if you could print guns just as good as the professionally manufactured big&#039;uns

Either a friend knows some guy who lives in some dodgy neighborhood full of people sharpening their dog&#039;s teeth on park swings. Or you get them off some random in a club whose entire body is an event horizon for his giant pupils.<br /><br />But don’t worry, it won’t always be this way. Scientists are working on a solution. That solution is 3D printed drugs. Instead of having to go and get drugs from the scary outside world you’ll be able to print custom drugs adapted to whatever your needs are, right there at home, in your bedroom. Surrounded by empty takeaway containers and a cat that will be stoned forever because everyone knows that cats can&#039;t release THC.<br /><br />And you won’t buy drugs either, you’ll download apps. These apps will give you access to the blueprints that will give you what you need. And you won’t even need to worry about the legality of drugs any more, because there won’t be any drug laws, because drugs will be so tailored it’ll be impossible for the state to keep up without resorting to selling them itself.<br /><br />The current drug economy where wars are waged and billions exchanged illegally will be a thing of the past. With with 3D printed drugs, we could enter a brave new world where taking any drug is as legal as drinking a cup of coffee. But even more customized. Which is fine, as long as we don’t all end up addicted to something that makes us want to eat each other’s faces off, because the tandem effects make us feel like the sun.<br /><br />But mostly, 3D printed drugs will be about being able to give people the medicine they need, customized just for them, to combat diseases that are currently incurable. From a family that&#039;s predisposed to some horrible, life-crippling disease? Then you’ll be taking combative drugs from birth. Hayfever sufferer? Then why not take this bespoke drug synthesized from local honey, you pussy. Plus we&#039;ll be able to wave goodbye to the corrupt big drug companies that are in cahoots with chemists, because as long as they&#039;re regulated, anyone who has a breakthrough will be able to market the drugs directly to the consumer.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thats fuckin nuts, I have also seen theories on the ability to create organism printers!!! It seems extremely possible though, I mean add some carbon, maybe some nitrogen or hydrogen, and then boom instant shit! Although these technologies are awesome they could be super dangerous too. Imagine if someone got their hands on a blueprint for some crazy ass disease or something. I also saw an article once saying how not to far in the future, the tech will be so cheap and easily available you could have a man making nuclear explosives in his basement with a laser fission device or something, I have a feeling a major cataclysm of some kind(Probably human created) will happen before this becomes possible, lol I can only hope =p I really wouldnt mind if all technology was wiped out along with all the evil motherfuckers destroying our planet, and I could just live a simple ass life wit a farm n shit, ahhhh the true meaning of hakuna matata!
