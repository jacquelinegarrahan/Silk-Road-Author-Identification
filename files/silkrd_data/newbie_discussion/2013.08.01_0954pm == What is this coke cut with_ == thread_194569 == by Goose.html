				Hey all, I just got a new batch of coke from a vendor who will remain nameless.&nbsp; It is much shinyer and more jittery than other batches.&nbsp; It came as all rock so that made me feel like it was high quality.&nbsp; It also has a very weird taste and it doesnt numb the back of my throat very much.&nbsp; Is it cut with speed?&nbsp; This is from a vendor claiming to have &quot;97% pure cocaine&quot;

				Because you get coke rocked up means nothing. Don&#039;t let anyone tell you different. That&#039;s a sales thing. As far as cutting, there are so many different cuts. None of us have any idea. Go google the different kinds. and 97% would be crazy good coke. hope you didn&#039;t get jipped! I could use an 8 right now! LOL<br /><br />Ryno

				could be cut with anything.<br /><br />burn/bleeds could be speed<br /><br />if it&#039;s wet could be speed paste<br /><br />if you get lots a bitter taste could be caffeine, caffeine also could make you restless, meth could make you kinda paranoid<br /><br />ephedrine shrinks blood vessels <br /><br />if it does not work right away - under a few minutes, it&#039;s cut a lot<br /><br />numbness, shine, rocks can be made artificially, don&#039;t mean much<br /><br />my guess is it&#039;s hard to find even 30% pure, 50% you&#039;d need to know people and likely pay more<br /><br />people throw around lots of numbers like &quot;90%&quot; etc, it&#039;s a joke<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just because its all rock does not make it official yayo, I used to cop heavy and re rock all the time locally few years ago until everybody started doing it so made business slow cause everybody had good prices.&nbsp; All you need to re rock is acetone and your good to go.&nbsp; I doubt they would cut with speed cause that&#039;s gonna cost them just as much money if not more.&nbsp; When people cut there yayo there gonna look for cheap options nodoz,novacane,isotol baking soda so it can still be cooked up, if you go to smoke shops they have this special cut forgot what it is called exactly I think it might be fish scale or something along those lines but that cut was real shiny and looked like shiny flakes thats prolly what your talking about or they used, cause I used it once and people aint really like it.&nbsp; But remember the best yayo comes in all powder.

				manatol and inistol&nbsp; are avalable at health food stores and smoke shops, there both kind of shiney but there a laxitive .&nbsp; but it could be anything. theres ways to wash the cut out but you will end up with less volume but better product.
