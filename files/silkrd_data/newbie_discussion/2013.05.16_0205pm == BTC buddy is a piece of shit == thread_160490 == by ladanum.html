				The &quot;do not reply&quot; message was likely a link to the Buyer&#039;s Guide.<br /><br />It states in the Buyer&#039;s Guide (and the F.A.Q.), which every buyer should have read by now, that Silk Road cannot take responsibility for these kinds of transcations.<br /><br />Please read the following:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Getting_Bitcoins<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please note that, while there are many vendors offering to sell Bitcoins directly from this site, we are not set up to facilitate this and it is very easy to get scammed this way.

				to whomever did this thanks very much as my opinion has been&nbsp; :-X<br /><br /><br />be careful with this guy I didn&#039;t read about him on the forum till after I ordered... hours after my moneypak was drained I messaged him saying this was a test run(sent $60) and I&#039;m looking to place a big order but I&#039;m paranoid then less than 5 min later the message was marked read and my money was there... I don&#039;t trust it probably wouldn&#039;t have seen any btc if I didn&#039;t tell him I was sending big order...everyone on the forum say he canceled they&#039;re order so he probably left all this good feedback himself he seems to be a selective scammer use at your own risk
