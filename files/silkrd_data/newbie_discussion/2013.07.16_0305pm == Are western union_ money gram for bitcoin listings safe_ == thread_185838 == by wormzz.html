				Is it safe to use those listings? What would one do if they sent the western union payment to the vendor and never received bitcoins? Can the escrow system solve this issue?<br /><br />

				Dude that&#039;s nothing to do with vendors/escrow.<br /><br />You don&#039;t seem sharp enough to be dealing with this kind of thing.. between popo and scammers you gon&#039; get rick rolled!<br /><br />best thing to do would be to get a mtgox.com account and do it the safe/slow way or find a way to deposit it directly into the bank account of a coin seller not a silk road seller, as in a legit bitcoin seller with good reviews on google not here. It&#039;s not illegal to buy/own bit coins.

				No No and No again, those kind of payments are never safe unless its sending money to close friends or family abroad! AVOID man, at any cost.<br /><br />What country are you in, I can recommend some good sites selling coins, your always going to get a fee on top the MTGOX current rate, that&#039;s how people make there money, and why scammers can try shit like that!<br /><br />Stay safe man!

				eventually wormz you might come across people who will sell you bitcoins with out the fee, but that will come on months if not years of flawless transactions. They do benefit by not having to pay a fee to sell it to a websight.. Stay away from it for now though till you are certain the person is trust worthy and you understand SR more so.
