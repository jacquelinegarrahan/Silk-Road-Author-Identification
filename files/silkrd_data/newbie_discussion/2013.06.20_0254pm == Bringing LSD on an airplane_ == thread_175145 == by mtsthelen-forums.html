				I have had acid last a LONG time (19 years is my longest, to be exact!), and was thinking of taking some with me on a plane trip this summer (to be ingested/enjoyed at my destination, not during the flight).<br /><br />I&#039;ve done a few &quot;litmus&quot; tests by putting a few blotter-sized pieces of a sticky note, wrapped in foil, in a plastic bag in my carryon, and security has said nothing about it on multiple occasions.<br /><br />But I haven&#039;t yet done it with the real thing... so... thoughts on traveling with this stuff? The stuff I have is WoW and unperforated, so... maybe that&#039;s good?

				Sorry, did you say that you&#039;ve kept acid hidden away for 19 years?<br /><br />I don&#039;t imagine anyone would ever find blotter tabs in a carry-on, unless they were very invasively searching ever morsel on you for another sketchy reason to begin with.

I did. I&#039;d love to say that I did all kinds of research before deciding how to store it, but... I suppose i got lucky. I had the acid in a small ziplock bag (that I&#039;m sure hasn&#039;t been airtight in over a decade!), and then folded up the bag and wrapped IT in aluminum foil (backwards, I know). This I kept this in a dry, dark vessel with a ton of desiccants inside there. Each time I&#039;d get a new pair of shoes I&#039;d take the desiccant and tuck it in there. Tried about a hit-and-a-quarter a year ago (my last of it) and, after 19.5 years, it worked just as well as it had on day one. Perfecto. ;)<br /><br />Perhaps I should post this under another thread so more people see it. ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175145.msg1267736#msg1267736">Quote from: saulgood on June 24, 2013, 02:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t imagine anyone would ever find blotter tabs in a carry-on, unless they were very invasively searching ever morsel on you for another sketchy reason to begin with.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, yeah, that makes sense.

				Unperforated?<br /><br />Cut out a piece the size of a piece of gum, wrap it in foil and then wrap the gum wrapper over it. viola! :) You can put it in your carry-on, but to put it in your dufflebag would be the safest.

				Inside a book, inside your wallet, inside your phone battery case or even inside your ipad cover. Especially since its unperf, It will never be noticeable and might even just get passed up if it is found. But wrap it up like that, now its weird and noticeable. I wouldn&#039;t use anything other then maybe wax paper while in transport

				not sure if sniffer dogs pick up LSD but at most domestic airports you don&#039;t have that issue as customs don&#039;t usually do the rounds i(n my county domestically anyway). taking it O/S i would steer clear of that. i&#039;ve taken pot on domestic flights; very small amounts only a gram or two, i just stuff it into a corner or two of my check in luggage really tight and have never had an issue. this way if i did get stopped i can pass it off as being there from ages ago and if i knew it was there i would&#039;ve smoked it ages ago too.

Dont. Blotter is easy. Take your phone battery out and stuff it in there, or just keep it in the bottom of a tight pocket in your wallet. <br /><br />Weed is stinky and not easy to get on planes in some airports. K9s can smell blow and weed easy. The best way I seen it done was to take a sharp butcher knife and cut a rectangular chunk out of the middle/back of a boot sole. Stuff the weed in, then cut most of the chunk off and use the rest as a cap. But there&#039;s always risk. For drugs like that never, ever carry them on your person. If you get caught &quot;My friend perdo packed my bags while I was out. He said he left me a present, I figured it was a picture of your mom, not an 8-ball.&quot;<br /><br />*Note- Do not say that or do any of the things I just said. Ever.

				I have brought acid on planes as well as other drugs.<br /><br />For LSD, it is by far the easiest.&nbsp; Carry it in your pocket, in your sock, in a book, in an envelope, it really will not attract attention because it is paper.&nbsp; TSA is concerned with metallic and sharp objects, liquids over a certain amount, gels, and things of this nature.&nbsp; They are not there to hunt down and confiscate your LSD and it is highly unlikely that they would think twice under the xray and they certainly wouldnt feel it in a pat down.<br /><br />For Cannabis, it is certainly more risky due to its size and smell, but I have successfully put 1/8&#039;s under my balls or near the privates where they dont really grab with any force in a pat down.&nbsp; Key is to also wrap it up so that it won&#039;t emit any suspicious weed smells.&nbsp; Probably would do the same with shrooms<br /><br />Things in powder of any kind, I would say the same thing, OR, even better and safer, if you have a 5HTP bottle or a vitamin bottle or anything that comes with capsules that you can remove the contents from and then fill it with your product, that is really nice.&nbsp; Then you just stick the pills back in the bottle with the other legit pills or just your product pills.&nbsp; There is no way in hell they would detect that or ever ask to rifle through each individual pill in a vitamin pill bottle...at least HIGHLY unlikely.<br /><br />If you can, try to put these types of things in your checked luggage as they get way less scrutiny.<br /><br />It is never a guarantee, but these steps are probably in the 90-95% success rate if you are not stupid about it.<br /><br />Good luck to you.
