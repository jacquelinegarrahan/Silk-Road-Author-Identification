				Just another name for ecstasy/mdma.&nbsp; Alot of people will try to tell you it&#039;s pure 100% mdma but 90% of the time it&#039;s cut with something and even if it isnt most mdma is around 80% purity.

				Of course the same old misinformation song and dance but it is just getting so old hearing people who only have very limited experience in a situation provide the information.&nbsp; I have never seen anyone go to the hospital because of e let alone straight molly.&nbsp; But am I gonna say you can not have a bad experience on it and there is no unsafe way to consume it.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve seen caffeine and asprin mixed together to with a little brown sugar and encapsulated.<br /><br />It might be different where you live, but in the Eastern Coast of America, molly is never MDMA. Yes I do have a test kit, and I&#039;ve seen plenty of pills that contain MDMA under all the shit ones. but I can count how many times on one hand, out of over 100 samples, I have tested MDMA in molly.
