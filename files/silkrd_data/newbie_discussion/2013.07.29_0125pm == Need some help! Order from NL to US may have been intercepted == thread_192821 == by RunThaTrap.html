				I placed an order on the 17th for 10 Ecstasy pills to be sent from the Netherlands to the US. It&#039;s now the 29th and I have yet to receive them. The vendor has issued a refund and is convinced that they will not arrive to me.&nbsp; Since this is my first time dealing with something like this, what should I expect to happen next. I have not received a letter from customs or anything indicating their seizure, but I am starting to feel paranoid. The order was for 10x 200mg pills.

				There&#039;s no need to worry. It is probably just stuck up in customs. Should be fine if the seller has good packaging. If not you will most likely get a love letter. That&#039;s about it.
