				First off congrats on your first SR purchase, I&#039;m still awaiting to make my first purchase but to answer your question,<br />As far as I know, USPS delivers regular mail on saturdays in most areas (I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t regular mail in your case)<br />Sundays they don&#039;t deliver I&#039;m pretty sure<br /><br />Regardless of this, you ordered an ounce of bud on a pretty consistent website from a trusted member, I would give it till Friday before getting any concerns. Let me know how it goes man !&nbsp; :)

				Thanks guys, I&#039;ve been giving myself anxiety after reading the Shipping boards. They make it seem like CDs are common.<br /><br />I ordered it for NWDirect so I&#039;m not worried he didn&#039;t send it, and I&#039;ve read his stealth is amazing. I think its primarily because most of his reviews say delivery in 48 hours so I was expecting that, but I know that&#039;s not him its USPS. I was just worried about USPS fucking it up or finding it... First timer paranoia I guess haha<br /><br />I&#039;ll report back when I get the package.

				What a bunch of bullshit responses...&nbsp; USPS works like this, its gotta get from one major mail center to another (by plane) and then to your address...&nbsp; So, it starts with how far away your vendor is from a major metropolitan area...&nbsp; I&#039;ve had &quot;Express&quot; shipments from the same state take 2 days because it takes a day for it to get to the nearest metropolitan area and then another day to me since I&#039;m in a major metro area... So, I always ask my vendor how close they are to a major metropolitan area - if they&#039;re in one and you&#039;re in one, Priority takes 2 days... If one of you are in one and the other isn&#039;t, look at 3 days - maybe 4 depending on how far the person who isn&#039;t in a metro area is from the metro area... If you&#039;re both in the sticks, look at 5 days, maybe more...<br /><br />Best of luck!

				also, just like a flight from LA to Chicago may make counter-intuitive layovers (such as in NYC), your package may do the same thing, delaying its delivery

				Actually, some delivery companies use the same system that the Post Office uses - called Next Flight Out -- and mail gets priority placement on these flights.&nbsp; They have contracts with all of the airlines and know when flights are direct to cities.&nbsp; The only thing that can bump mail is human remains.&nbsp; (Private shipping companies are called Quik, Sterling, Midnite Express, etc...)&nbsp; So, I think they don&#039;t actually make &#039;weird&#039; connections that delay the packages - almost all of them are non-stop, maybe a few have connections, but they&#039;re few and far between (and they aren&#039;t way out of the way)...

				99% of the time for me priority gets here ahead of schedule, 3rd day or even 2nd day in some cases, but I have had it take upwards of 3 weeks when the mail was funneled to the wrong distribution center or something.
