				Sounds incredibly risky .... what if the vendor is LE?&nbsp; They get your general location, send you the phone numbers, you call those numbers, and what if those &quot;hookers&quot; are LE?

				I&#039;d assume you go off the vendors reputation in regards to that specific listing.<br /><br />He already has a few feedback for that exact item.<br /><br />Just like any other item? how do you know hes not LE and gonna send cops instead of MDMA/Weed/Coke/etc. you make a decision based on previous feedback.

				Just a heads up guys, for those who want to legalize a stint with a hooker. Making PORN is legal, even though prostitution is not. So if you could get someone to agree to an erotic photoshoot or being in a porno with you, it is automatically legal. Not all hookers would be up for that, mind you, but even on Craigslist people are posting looking for models and amateur porn stars. After all, it is legal to make amateur porn. That is what Xtube and other sites are all about.<br /><br />This won&#039;t be a great idea for those of you with families you are trying to hide your sex lives from or partners who think you&#039;re in a monogamous relationship, but it does save you from the cops.

				You do not need a business license to make a porn film. You need a business license to form a porn company, but you also have the legal right to make a film without a license. It won&#039;t protect you from lawsuits, so just don&#039;t go plastering it all over the internet or you may have someone coming to you expecting a portion of the profits if there isn&#039;t a contract. Legally, a verbal agreement is binding as long as it doesn&#039;t violate state laws. So check and make sure filming sex tapes isn&#039;t illegal in your area. You could go ahead and film her while you both agree to make the film, discuss how it can or can not be distributed, and how she will be reimbursed. <br /><br />Obviously the distribution should not take place at all and should be a moot point. The whole idea is to get proof that this is a transaction where you are -not- paying for sex, because legally paying someone to take naked pictures or erotic video is somehow different than prostitution, just like having someone pose naked for art classes is differently regulated than taking naked pictures of them would be.

				OP, just curious on how it worked, do the 0.74 BTC cover the hooker or was that just for the 5 phone numbers? also what is the point of charging for shipping if he can just message the numbers over SR? although i guess i should just be asking the vendor about that.<br /><br />as for something only you could answer, was the pussy worth it? aside from the novelty value of saying you bought it on SR with bitcoin.
