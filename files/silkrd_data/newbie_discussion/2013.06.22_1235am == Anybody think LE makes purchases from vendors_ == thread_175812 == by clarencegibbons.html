				Just wondering if Anybody think LE makes purchases from vendors on here? If they did, you&#039;d think it&#039;d be relatively easy for them to nail down where the &quot;goodies&quot; were being shipped from, and start surveillance of post offices/blue boxes in that area. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I&#039;m just unduly paranoid?&nbsp; Reason I ask, is I have a buddy who&#039;s interested in starting a vendor account on here, and trying to cover all the bases to stay one or more steps ahead of John Q. Law.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I know driving an hour or two from your home base to drop shipments would be advisable, and changing up the direction N,W,E, S . That you travel to mail packages would be advisable, just wondering if anybody else has any recommendations for minimizing the risk of getting pinched?

				I think there is no questions that LE is both buying and selling on SR.&nbsp; The question is are you large enough for them to care about?&nbsp; My guess is that if they are trying to hunt someone down, it is probably the top sellers making a ton of money and moving massive amounts of product.&nbsp; There just isn&#039;t the funding to go after every small to medium vendor on SR.&nbsp; They have enough trouble catching the big boys.&nbsp; It seems like all they can do is wait until they slip up once like receiving moneygrams directly or something like that.<br /><br />That being said, I think if you stay a medium or small-sized vendor, you keep your stealth up to speed with the latest methods, and are diligent about finding secure and unique drop-offs, using wisely chosen return addresses, and keep your finger prints off everything, you can safely maintain being a successful vendor.&nbsp; I think one of the keys is to not be greedy.&nbsp; If you are doing well, be happy with that and don&#039;t try to expand faster than you can in a safe way.<br /><br />Then the best bet once you have a healthy customer base is to go into stealth mode.&nbsp; This will keep your customer-base limited and will take you out of the SR public eye, and this will certainly be beneficial in avoiding issues and attracting attention.<br /><br />Best of luck.

				They most defiantly would be but there wouldn&#039;t be much they can do just because of the masses amounts of mail that comes through the good vendors change up there stealth regularly and packaging. <br />They could start tracing back similar items but I&#039;m sure there will be tons of mail that gets through the more people ordering the Bette chances for everyone :)

Discrepancies between return addresses and the zip code a package is sent from are a major red flag. <br /><br />And yeah, you could use false return addresses in the neighborhood of the area you&#039;d be sending from, but this brings other problems. What happens when the package is returned? It&#039;s far better to have a return address that&#039;s legitimate and at least somewhat within your control, as any vendor will tell you that buyers do not always give their true names and addresses, which means that packages will get sent back. If it&#039;s returned without trouble you&#039;ve got your drugs back and you&#039;ve avoided an investigation - no harm, no foul. Putting a false return address on the label means either that the wrong person will open it (and call the police as a result, meaning you&#039;d have to hope your prints aren&#039;t on anything inside and that you&#039;ll need to avoid that general drop for a year or two), or (at best) that you&#039;re out the shipment. <br /><br />Best way to minimize risk? Be smart and think things through.

				Don&#039;t overthink all of this.&nbsp; Remember postal employees have lives too and they mostly just want to finish their damn shift.&nbsp; I think the biggest risk factor is a funky smell emitting from the package.&nbsp; Make sure your vendors use Mylar packaging or some sort of sealed packaging.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know how LE could successfully pull off a sting operation by posing as a vendor. How would they find the evidence that the person whose address was sent over SR was that SR user in question?<br /><br />I think it&#039;s undoubtedly more likely they would pose as SR purchasers, but even then, there&#039;s only so much evidence they could possibly accrue with this method. Post offices pick up mail from dozens, even hundreds, of post boxes. In the one case I&#039;ve heard of an SR vendor being busted, I believe they were just caught in an unrelated traffic stop.

				To answer OP: yes. Better yet, it is highly likely they&#039;re a vendor already. The Farmer&#039;s Market bust was done initially via an agent selling to other Market members, and the recent bust of Casey Jones/Truckin/Hughes (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176320.0) is consistent with Hughes having bought from a SR seller. (Hughes is reportedly out on bail, so that raises the interesting question - what vendors did he buy from, paying with ~11btc...?)

				I think they know its too difficult. Regardless of the pressure they get to crack down on SR they are most likely still focusing on street crime and more traditional drug busts because they don&#039;t want to reinvent the wheel to catch a &quot;bad guy&quot;. They are too busy eating donuts to learn about encryption. But take every precaution because the risk is still always present. Just don&#039;t be stupid.
