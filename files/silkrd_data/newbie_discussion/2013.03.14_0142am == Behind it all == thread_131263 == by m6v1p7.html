				Being new to something as what was once percieved as &quot;unimagineable&quot;, believe it or not, is pretty exciting. I couldn&#039;t believe when i was told of an online drug pharmacy. I was even more shocked to find out that it was mailed to your house no problem. This then got me and a friend into the conversation of the existance of illuminati and how someone has to be tied to something and so on..But it did leave me with the questoion for ... who is really that is behind it all?

				Healthy paranoia is good.&nbsp; But this is no massive honey pot.&nbsp; The structure prohibits it (SR and BTC, the underlying structure).&nbsp; This is the true free market and the state has taken notice accordingly&nbsp; SR is too decentralized by design to be a massive honey pot.&nbsp; That said, stay safe and smart and don&#039;t give yourself away.&nbsp; Law enforcement is clearly present here to some degree.<br /><br />Always wash your BTC and PGP your address!

				Thank for the advice.<br />To my belief the man behind it all, well.. the authorities know who is behind it all but the man brought the term &quot;off the grid&quot; a whole new meaning, that is what i think anyways

				The somebody is most likely less than a person and more of many people.&nbsp; Too many variables would have to be closed for this to go away. Kill one site and several more will pop up. The genie is out of the bottle. <br /><br />This is a very foreign concept but we will all get used to it over time.
