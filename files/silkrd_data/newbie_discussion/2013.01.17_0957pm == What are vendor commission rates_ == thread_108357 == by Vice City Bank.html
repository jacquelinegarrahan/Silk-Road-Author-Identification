				For example I have a $1000 cash in your mail box listing. I am doing pre-commission.<br /><br />So the total at the end is 1,038.50. <br /><br />I thought the commission for $1000 bucks is 2% which should equals 1020.<br /><br />Have the commissions raised in price? Can some one please give me up to date commission details.<br /><br />Thanks

Does that mean everything after that is not 1.5%?

				SR&#039;s Sellers Fees are:<br /><br />10% of the first $50&nbsp; so $5<br />8.5% of $50 - 150&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+$8.50<br />6% of $150 - 300&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +$9<br />3% of $300 - 500&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +$6<br />2% of $500 - 1000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+$10<br />1.5% for everything over $1000&quot;<br /><br />so for a purchase of $1000 the total is 5 + 8.50 + 9 + 6 + 10 for the total of 38.50<br /><br />The fees are for each item sold.&nbsp; They are not based on the vendors gross sales.&nbsp;

				Dude set up, and maintains a site for us to sell and buy drugs on. And, he shouldn&#039;t make any money? Even a total of 3.85% on a $1000?

				I read online that there is an estimated $22 million in goods sold a year.&nbsp; Who knows if that is in fact the actual number or not but I believe that SR is definitely seeing growth due to efforts in the media.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure DPR is doing well but I am sure this is not a cheap operation to run annually and I&#039;m sure that is why the fees seem high to many.
