				Why do you bother posting shit like this about nothing? You should use some of that free time you currently have to stop wasting bandwidth on the forum with threads like this and learn to use the site safely and properly. If you want to talk shit, there are loads of threads already open which cover a range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;???

				Wadozo, didn&#039;t you read the thread title? Have you seen some of the other newbie threads? Folks have got to get their count up, there are worse ways than having a chat. She might even have been looking for somebody to tell her to chill on the pills a bit when she&#039;s between jobs.<br />C&#039;mon man, you&#039;ve obviously helped a great many people here given your stats--cut the girl a break.

				Mate, I did read the title. If you can&#039;t see that there are dozens upon dozens of threads such as this,&nbsp; made to get your post count up as quickly as possible, then you must be hiding under a rock! Threads such as this are just adding to the workload of the poor Moderators, considering there is just the two of them now. These threads will eventually be deleted as they serve no purpose, take up valuable space and create extra work for Mods who will end up deleting them, especially when you consider they are already over worked. Posting shit to up your post count is going against what DPR and the Admins want you to get out of it. It is a chance for new members to ask questions and do some research on how to use SR safely but more importantly, anonymously. There is a host of newbie&#039;s who actually believe that using Tor to order drugs online is all one has to do to be safe and secure. One day, these people will be wishing they took Internet Security a little more seriously when they find themselves in serious shit. There will come a day where SR will face a series of attacks from LE. When that day will occur is anyone&#039;s guess, but to under estimate the Police and the powers and people they have at their disposal, is sheer madness IMO. As they say, you can lead a horse to water but you can&#039;t make it drink! This is a situation where you can&#039;t afford to learn from your mistakes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;m not out to pick a fight with ya but she would be shattered by that post man.. remember how enthusiastic and excited we all where a week into the SR life and $1500 in a week is up there in the &#039;putting your money where your mouth is&#039; terms so maybe a little slack is called for here?<br /><br />Welcome Mrs.. can I suggest a forum search focused on security (actually just roll over to the security forum and read the stickies) and have a read of the new Aussie rthread in the off-topic section for a better understanding of the politics involved in posting &#039;Aussie&#039; threads... there is a whole story there and Wad knows it back to front. Prolly why you got crewed out so hard&nbsp; cause Wad and the long term forum posters have been dealing with all sorts of crap so will be on a short fuse for alot of things.<br /><br />I have been on SR for almost a year now but only in the last month I have decided to get my forum on! <br /><br />One final thing; any discussion about OS vendors and any success/tactics used are strictly a PM discussion. <br /><br />Feel free to PM me with any questions you have and I will answer what I can and direct you to others on the ones I cannot.<br /><br />:-D

				to answer the question i have had mostly success ordering from the UK but i have not yet purchased anything from the Netherlands because i have a feeling customs would probably be all over it... still i may try it one day as they have some great deals.<br /><br />anyway welcome to the road please take the advice of members like wadozo they are not trying to be harsh they are trying to help you learn.

				Wadozo, I take your point. For me it goes back to the old Aristotelian axiom..<br /><br />&quot;Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody&#039;s power and is not easy.&quot;<br /><br />Heavy hitters with big stats like yourself wield a lot of power to effect newbs, and let&#039;s not mess about, many of us will have issues in our lives here on SR. I do however, appreciate your frustration, but the 50 posts thing doesn&#039;t work, people just post total shite--I try to keep whatever fascistic ideas I think will work in a given situation a thoughtful going through--in this case though, anybody posting obvious one word random crap should have(once noticed) a week to consider why they can&#039;t post at all, and why it will take them 100 posts to get to post outside the newbie&#039;s forum. Free speech is essential, but I&#039;d expect Voltaire to have a longer conversation with Nick Griffin than someone without tourettes speaking as if they did.<br /><br />In essence I share your sensibilities on this I think, but whatever DPR&#039;s good intentions, a cumbersome loophole exists, but I don&#039;t think some high chick being excited about joining SR and at least making some for of community effort(instigating chat) warrants a put down from a person like yourself.<br /><br />Enjoy your weekend!<br />

				I do get frustrated sometimes with people&#039;s laziness. Some have this &quot;I can&#039;t be bothered &quot; attitude here on the Forum when it comes to doing some of their own research, especially looking for an answer to something. I will always go out of my way to help those who put in some effort towards looking for answers themselves and show a little initiative. Ask other members here about how they feel when they&#039;re constantly being asked the same questions over and over by people each and every day. <br />Before any newbie&#039;s even contemplate making a purchase, they should have read through both the Buyer&#039;s and Seller&#039;s Guides on using SR.&nbsp; Then a visit to the SR Wiki is essential as well. On the SR site itself, there is a little piece at the top right hand corner of the Homepage which was written by DPR called &quot;A Few Words from the Dread Pirate Roberts.&quot; It&#039;s basically a short statement where DPR reiterates some very important points previously made elsewhere. After reading the above mentioned documents a few times over, you should then start to focus on just reading and posting here on the Forum. Feel free to ask questions whenever you feel the need to and don&#039;t be shy. Newbie&#039;s showing some effort in beginning the steep learning curve required to use the SR site safely and anonymously will be surprised at just how lax their own security had become. Your safety on SR and ability to stay anonymous are paramount. <br />tolega - you sound like the uneducated, pretentious upstart down the road from me who thought his ass was his elbow!&nbsp; :P<br />HellInaHandBaske - I read somewhere a greet saying that is appropriate for this situation I believe...<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s nice to be important but it&#039;s more important to be nice.&quot;<br /><br />Can&#039;t for the life of me remember who the wise soul was that has this in their sig.. but its fitting huh?<br />Is that a joke or were you being serious?&nbsp; &nbsp;:P :P :P :P<br />Mate, did you read my signature at all? That&#039;s where you would have seen it.

We are pointing out some things to you so you won&#039;t potentially make a life changing mistake.<br />No one would ever expect you to know how everything works on SR in just 2 weeks, even after 4 months you will only be touching the sides, so to speak! Why you would ever think that, I don&#039;t know. However, why would you place orders for illegal substances to be delivered to an address of your choice when in all honesty, you have a limited knowledge of the dangers involved and the potential to fuck up is very real. You&#039;re doing things back to front. Educate yourself on how things operate on SR, on how to set up and order securely on SR and most importantly, how to remain anonymous when conducting business on SR. I&#039;m assuming that you still need to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages made with GPG which should be used to send your address to a vendor or am I wrong in saying this? The importance of operating in a secure and anonymous fashion can&#039;t be under estimated IMO. Having this attitude of &quot;I&#039;m just trying to get my post count to 50&quot; has become a real issue for some newbies but all for the wrong reasons. A smart person would use the first 50 posts they make to ask any questions they may have to help them grow and improve their knowledge of SR. Use the initial period of time in the Newbie Sub-Forum to prepare themselves for the unexpected and secure their system and operation in such a way that you don&#039;t have to panic about everything and anything should SR be compromised. You need to minimize or remove any risks that one takes here and continue to think about or create new and improved ways of doing things. This can only be done through continued education and an understanding of the principles behind it all. ;)<br /><br />As you said, I was just being honest with you and hope you will look at things differently from now on, perhaps even err on the side of caution. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

Why you would ever think that, I don&#039;t know. However, why would you place orders for illegal substances to be delivered to an address of your choice when in all honesty, you have a limited knowledge of the dangers involved and the potential to fuck up is very real. You&#039;re doing things back to front. Educate yourself on how things operate on SR, on how to set up and order securely on SR and most importantly, how to remain anonymous when conducting business on SR. I&#039;m assuming that you still need to learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages made with GPG which should be used to send your address to a vendor or am I wrong in saying this? The importance of operating in a secure and anonymous fashion can&#039;t be under estimated IMO. Having this attitude of &quot;I&#039;m just trying to get my post count to 50&quot; has become a real issue for some newbies but all for the wrong reasons. A smart person would use the first 50 posts they make to ask any questions they may have to help them grow and improve their knowledge of SR. Use the initial period of time in the Newbie Sub-Forum to prepare themselves for the unexpected and secure their system and operation in such a way that you don&#039;t have to panic about everything and anything should SR be compromised. You need to minimize or remove any risks that one takes here and continue to think about or create new and improved ways of doing things. This can only be done through continued education and an understanding of the principles behind it all. ;)<br /><br />As you said, I was just being honest with you and hope you will look at things differently from now on, perhaps even err on the side of caution. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It wasn&#039;t so much what you said, but how you said it. I understand you get pissed off with the majority of Aussies asking the same old dumb questions but the best thing to do in those cases is to simply ignore them or delete the thread. People will soon get the hint they need to do their own digging (hell, I just discovered I could post in the newbie forum couple of days ago).<br /><br />And now I have just discovered that there&#039;s a wiki! Yay for more reading.

				As an Aussie myself I am deeply embarrassed by the amount of absolutely pointless crap you guys post on these forums. Because of you idiots posting this shit we have become the laughing stock of these forums. So if you have nothing interesting to say bugger off and post on your facebook or twitter accounts. Better still there should be no Aussie posts at all as it only attracts attention by the wrong people.
