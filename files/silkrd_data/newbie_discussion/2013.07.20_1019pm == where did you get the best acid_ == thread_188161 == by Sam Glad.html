				I haven&#039;t bought any from the SR, but have had a little irl.&nbsp; The best I got came from a festival.&nbsp; I had 4 tabs WoW and 4 tabs of gel.&nbsp; I think I paid $15 a tab for each.&nbsp; Myself and 2others split the 8 tabs between us, each getting equal amounts of gel and paper, nearly 3 tabs per person.&nbsp; Tripped most of the day, then I didn&#039;t sleep at all that night.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty normal for me.<br /><br />One of them could have been bunk and other potent or both mediocore.&nbsp; Looking back I don&#039;t wish I had done anything differently.&nbsp; I will never know who sold me legit or if it was a combination of things.&nbsp; Such is life, no?

				They where most likely both potent clean LSD. The most potent hits ive ever had in all my years where from NorCal many moons ago, it was liquid, it was bliss. Thats not to say i havnt had equally clean L here on SR or from other IRL sources. That particular vial way back when was said to have had 500ug drops. <br /><br />There is some excellent LSD to be had here on the Road. Check the LSD Avengers thread frequently to keep up to date on the L buzz.

				hmm.. some dude name psychedelic eric, i think he was in england.&nbsp; gave me a few star microdots and some albert hoffman blotters.&nbsp; All acid i had since then didn&#039;t feel as strong. this was about 5 or so years ago.

				Wonderful replies.&nbsp; I enjoyed reading those.&nbsp; <br /><br />The aforementioned good deals were done very professionally.&nbsp; The dealers caught us leaving after a big mid-day performer to go back to camp.&nbsp; They were posted on a trail and near the gate.<br /><br />The only time I&#039;ve been TOTALLY burned on a deal was when I was SEEKING out the acid.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find it.&nbsp; It has to find me I guess.
