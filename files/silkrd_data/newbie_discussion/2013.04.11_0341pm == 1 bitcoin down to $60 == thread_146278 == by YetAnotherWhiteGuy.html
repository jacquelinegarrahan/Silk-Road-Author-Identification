				Yeah it&#039;s crazy how it&#039;s been fluctuating (dropping, mostly)... I&#039;m ordering something soon and very lucky that I haven&#039;t purchased my coins yet.

				looks like it&#039;s around 120 now.&nbsp; My guess is that it settles somewhere around 60-75, which probably closer represents their true current value, based on market conditions.&nbsp;

				Same boat as the rest of you, I was hours away from buying via bitinstant, then stopped. Tomorrow I&#039;m gonna try yet again. It was like $240 a few days ago, insane.

				The price is insane right now. On MtGox 1 BTC is going for $160 to $200? I can&#039;t believe it. But yesterday they crashed really low (or so I heard). Can anyone fill me in on what&#039;s been going on over the previous 2 days?<br /><br />I was going to make an order on Silk Road but I don&#039;t know if I should now. In the time it takes to buy the Bitcoins, transfer them to my SR wallet and make the purchace etc. the price might have plummeted.

				I agree, if you haven&#039;t bought BTC yet, I would probably wait a few days until the the BTC has stabilized before making the jump... The market is too volatile right now!

				It&#039;s not helping prices today with MtGOX down, and it seems Bitfloor is now down, while everyones slow. <br /><br />Everyone that jumped on board thinking they were going to get rich are sweating bullets, and may want to just massive sell tomorrow if things are ready to go again. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to hopefully have funds on standby with bitfloor to get some.

				With the insane spike in the value of bitcoins this year, this was bound to happen. The people who bought bitcoins in the early stages and sold them when the price was like $200 are very lucky.
