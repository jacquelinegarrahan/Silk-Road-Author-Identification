				I&#039;m wanting to get a po box to be more &#039;discreet&#039; and am seeking a little advice.&nbsp; 1. I&#039;d imagine that unless I have a fake ID to get the po box with, then i won&#039;t be any more anonymous than receiving it at my house.&nbsp; Am i correct there?&nbsp; If so is there another way around that i haven&#039;t thought of?&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Does it matter where I get a po box, or should I just go through usps?&nbsp; Grateful for any advice, thx

				Don&#039;t use a fake ID unless you&#039;re prepared to face mail fraud. That carries a heavier penalty than personal drug use, and if you get busted with drugs, or a controlled delivery is conducted, your fake ID scheme will pin you with intent to buy drugs (because it looks like you are trying to be deceptive--which you are). This is not a good idea. I would say, use your real name and order small amounts for personal use, research your vendor and PM about stealthy packaging before ordering. There will always be risk in this sort of business.

				I read that it&#039;s preferred to get a PO box at a &quot;mom and pop&quot; type place, but I haven&#039;t looked into this. Definitely don&#039;t use a fake ID though, because that&#039;s just adding to your potential penalties if you get caught!<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3

				Well there is always plausible deniability so just make sure if you get burned on an order to switch it up. Also using a fake ID can be more trouble than what you would be looking at normally so I wouldn&#039;t go that route. Good Luck and Happy Ordering.

				Just put up a letterbox with a pseudoname on it, somewhere besides other letterboxes,<br />works like a charm.

				Get a fake ID on the road or somewhere else online and go to UPS because they don&#039;t take check and you don&#039;t need a social security number.

				I opened up a box at a mom&amp;pop place under my real name, using a fake buisness with some fake names on it. Guess this way I have either option. IF it&#039;s a hot package ill prob put my name on it, and send dummy mail to the other names so it looks legit

				Either get a part time job at a hotel or find someone else who works at the front desk at one. Have your deliveries sent to a room number at the hotel that wont get rented to. Saythe room numbers in the hotel only go up to 200. have the package sent to room number 300. that way you can use what ever name you want, just make sure the person you have working there knows to keep that shit set to the side for you to scoop up.

				Yes.&nbsp; One good fake ID, no SSN, and CC needed at UPS.&nbsp; Although I had no idea that mom and pop places had p.o. boxes that&#039;s awesome!&nbsp; The same thing would work there.&nbsp; Also the friend at a hotel thing is genius if it could work out.&nbsp; You would have to no for certain it would work if it came and your friend wasn&#039;t working and etc.

I may or may not know a vendor who may or may not ship and deliver through a hotel mail system. They may or may not have items shipped to different names to the same room number or conference room that may or may not actually exist in the hotel. The item will sit in that room&#039;s mail box for months unless its claimed, due to guests receiving mail after check out or before check in. Someone just needs to be aware of the possibility that an item for a specific name may be delivered and that the item is to be set aside until they arrive. Mom and pop stores generally have cameras and hours of operation. If you have to follow someone else&#039;s schedule to open your box, you cant exactly be discreet about it. If LE is watching your box number, they dont need a name, they just need to catch you opening the box. <br />IF you cant find a hotel job or a trust worthy ally that works at one, then just have the items shipped to your home. Alter the spelling of your name slightly. if your name is john&nbsp; use jon for your shipping address. If it is intercepted you can just claim that you do not accept strange mail with typos. You will only need a drop address for LARGE and SMELLY purchases. Drug dogs aren&#039;t going to trigger on a ten strip in an envelope, but they will trigger on a bunch a smelly bud. If you ever get a letter from the post office dont even bother going down to pick up your package unless you are 100% CERTAIN that it is a non-contraband shipment.<br />IF you have fear, then SR is not our market and you should destroy your fears before venturing back to SR. Also Over confidence is what gets people locked up. Plausible denilability&nbsp; is the key to life. <br /><br />Good luck fellow traveler. Be safe

				Popping my forum cherry here.&nbsp; I got a PO Box and as long as you buy from a vendor with decent stealth, and stay away from moving pounds of coke or weed to your address I dont really see much of an issue.&nbsp; Mylar really has been a great addition to the stealth game.

				Everything I&#039;ve read seems to indicate that a PO Box is a way to attract more issues than it solves if you are simply conducting small personal transactions.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going for more then something else than a PO system would probably be more worthwhile anyway so take that into consideration.&nbsp; You know your address and mailbox so if something fishy is going on aren&#039;t you going to notice? Whereas a PO box has a lot more potential issues in my opinion.

				yea the only way to keep it truly anyomous would be to open a PO box in a business name, and say you are just an employee. to add an extra level of security you can use a mail forwarding service. for example, make all your orders off SR go to an adress in NY that forwards to your real address in OH.. then say that the business you work for is a mail forwarding servie and that you were susposed to forward the package to FL or some shit. it gets complicated but that the idea behind true anyomous packages. and the best way would be to create you business in a country besides the one you live in. using fake info. hard to do but the only way to stay off the grid
