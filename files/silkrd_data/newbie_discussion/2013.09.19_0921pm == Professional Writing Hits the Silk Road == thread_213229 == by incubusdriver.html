				I think this is a niche the Road needs and I believe you will find some success. That being said, without trying to be harsh, here are my honest thoughts after reading your profile:<br /><br />What sales experience do you have that is relevant? Is any of it on Silk Road? Have you ever had a vendor account? Do you know what is actually important to have in a vendor&#039;s profile? How much experience with various types of drugs do you have? Are you going to be able to write an excellent product description for drugs that you have not actually used? Where can I see other reviews you have left? Etc.<br /><br />I also found the alliteration a bit gimmicky (&#039;vicious&#039; vendor profiles? trying a bit too hard maybe) and it seemed to me that your page lacked some real substance, mainly in the form of more Silk Road specific content as mentioned above.<br /><br />Anyway, I do think there are a lot of people who need a service a like this, and I wish you the best of luck.<br /><br />edit: Also, I would find a vendor that appears to have excellent product but really needs your services and offer to do it for free. Then you can point to that vendor on your profile as an example. Just a thought.

				Hey Cork1Screw. <br /><br />I already wrote a couple of bits for vendors before setting up my vendor profile, many of whom have left comments scattered about my various threads (mainly my main thread in the &#039;Product Offers&#039; section).<br /><br />Also, thanks for your comments and support. I&#039;ll try to address the questions you raised:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213229.msg1556741#msg1556741">Quote from: Cork1Screw on September 22, 2013, 09:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What sales experience do you have that is relevant? Is any of it on Silk Road? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As mentioned, I already worked with a few vendors prior to setting up my vendor profile, to test the waters and get a feel for what was needed. I don&#039;t want to point to their profiles etc incase they&#039;d rather keep it private (because oddly enough, some people - both here and in the real world - don&#039;t like their customers knowing they sought external help, even though it&#039;s a common business practice).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213229.msg1556741#msg1556741">Quote from: Cork1Screw on September 22, 2013, 09:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Have you ever had a vendor account? Do you know what is actually important to have in a vendor&#039;s profile?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, this is my first vendor account. I only know what&#039;s important based on the guidelines set by Silk Road regarding policy, my knowledge of how Silk Road works as a buyer, the input provided by vendors when they order, and from what they&#039;ve already tried to communicate in their existing copy. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213229.msg1556741#msg1556741">Quote from: Cork1Screw on September 22, 2013, 09:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How much experience with various types of drugs do you have? Are you going to be able to write an excellent product description for drugs that you have not actually used?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have tried several drugs, but there are loads I haven&#039;t. This is where the vendor&#039;s expertise comes into play - a vendor should know their shit. If they don&#039;t, they shouldn&#039;t be vending. And if they expect me to know about everything about their specific product, they&#039;d probably be unwise. In the real world, I have to become an overnight expert in numerous industry&#039;s and more specific niches. One week I might have to become fluent in workflow automation software, another I might have to learn the ins and outs of light rail infrastructure. I rarely know everything about a product before writing about it, but I have the ability to quickly understand even complex concepts with minimal input from the supplier of such product or service. Most vendors already have all the information I need in their profiles/listings, and for those who don&#039;t, I can ask questions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213229.msg1556741#msg1556741">Quote from: Cork1Screw on September 22, 2013, 09:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Where can I see other reviews you have left? Etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have already completed my first sale as a vendor and the feedback is now in view. The buyer in question is not using an alter-alias for his feedback, and the product listing shows what he/she ordered. Hopefully this is enough for other potential buyers to find - using only minimal research - items I&#039;ve delivered previously. Of course, other examples aren&#039;t necessarily going to be relevant to the next person&#039;s order. Whereas one person might have low sales and might want some marketing spin to drive sales higher, another might have high sales but issues with terms which they want communicating more clearly. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213229.msg1556741#msg1556741">Quote from: Cork1Screw on September 22, 2013, 09:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I also found the alliteration a bit gimmicky (&#039;vicious&#039; vendor profiles? trying a bit too hard maybe) and it seemed to me that your page lacked some real substance, mainly in the form of more Silk Road specific content as mentioned above.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fair play. I like gimmicky when it&#039;s tongue-in-cheek, which is what I was going for with my listing titles. Of course, I imagine it doesn&#039;t always come across as tongue-in-cheek, and could come across to many as just plain cheesy. <br /><br />I really do appreciate the advice, but the gimmicks are going to stay at least for now ;-)<br /><br />Again, thanks for your input. And +1!

With the missing link not actually missing.... Arylcyclohexylamines. Lily was right, I think at least. And I&#039;m going to try and do a format/re-install of my 8-circuits here soon (Leary). Junkie Love! What if we cared for each other as much as a fiend does for a fix? I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of people ready to self-actualize and transcend lately. I think the SR is gonna be a pivotal part of the new era.<br /><br />Ironically, my next pulp-fiction zombie story with a junkie twist plays on this. What if the Chinese Chemists make a Research Chemical that actually does turn people into zombies, and already having them hooked, 99.9% of the world main-lines a taste for brains at once? So the tale of Redd and Grey unfolds.... Well, Grey dies in the first 3,000 words. Ha.

Rather, it was to do with running a writing business based in &#039;the real world&#039; as opposed to over the &#039;deep web&#039; (or, the TOR network).<br /><br />If you want my opinion on the two sentences, I&#039;m going to say that I find yours more difficult to draw meaning from - and whether or not it&#039;s more correct, copywriting is about making an impact on a particular audience using the written word. <br /><br />If I were tasked with selecting my sentence or yours as a sentence to use in a piece of marketing collateral (bizarre situation, I know), I&#039;d still select mine regardless of accuracy, as I feel it connects more naturally. Of course, that&#039;s pure opinion.<br /><br />Of course, the last thing I&#039;d like to bring up, is that different English-speaking countries use the English language very differently; what is correct in Australia for example, may not be quite so in Canada. Taking your use of commas in your penultimate paragraph for example, I&#039;d hazard a guess that you&#039;re from the United States. I could, of course, be wrong :-)
