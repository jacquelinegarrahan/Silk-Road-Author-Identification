				not really, everybody, especially vendors need to learn a thing or two first or prove themselves before going to the main forums or private vendor forums. I wouldnt want leo having access to a vendor forum just by buying an account, would you?

				Not necessarily to the vendor forums. However, the 50 post limit is pretty arbitrary. Probably something that could be lifted for people who have taken the $500 or however much it is plunge into a vendor account. Posting 50 times is not very hard, especially when the mods allow spam threads to exist which are nearly 900 pages long. I think actually putting your money down shows more commitment than posting 50 times, but LEO would have no problem doing either of these things.<br /><br />So its odd to see vendors posting in the newbie section who couldn&#039;t even post in Product Offers. Partially because they didn&#039;t even take the time to spam 50 posts.

				I don&#039;t like them either... but the post limit is so arbitrary I did that to get to 50. But at least there were conversations going on in those threads when I was working on it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think counting posts ever did anyone any good. Even displaying post count encourages people to spam just to raise their fake stats.

				I have been on the forums for a week now and I never used the SPAM TO 50 threads.&nbsp; Just by spending time and reading threads and posting when I actually have something to add to a conversation, I have become a LOT more familiar with Silk Road.&nbsp; I am glad they forced me to hang out in this Newbie Forum so that I could see a lot of newbie questions get asked AND ANSWERED for the last week.<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling like a Silk Road pro now and have my first two orders marked IN TRANSIT as of today.&nbsp; <br /><br />So for that, I am thankful.&nbsp; THANK YOU SILK ROAD NEWBIE FORUM!<br /><br />I recommend all newbies take the time to get through your first 50 posts without using the SPAM TO 50 threads.&nbsp; It is very valuable and has made my first SR purchases safe, effective, and easy.<br /><br />Keep on keeping on... (in fact, I think this very post MIGHT be my 50th post!&nbsp; HOLLA!)&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Don&#039;t really see why it should piss anyone off how anyone gets to 50 posts. I&#039;ve been coming on the forum and buying from the site for months now and still only at 30-odd posts but don&#039;t have the time to sit here for 90minutes reading and posting through the newbie forum to get up to 50.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to know the forum to understand anything about Silk Road. It helps if you have someone who knows the system to get you through your first purchase but I managed to figure it out myself without any drama.
