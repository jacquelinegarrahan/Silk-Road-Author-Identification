				i think it would be very helpful if there was a section for each country so one can access info only relating to said country.<br /><br />for a noob like it would help me understand things pertaining to my country without having to search every thread with (ie) Australia in it for specific info.<br /><br />maybe it&#039;s not done for to security reasons or maybe i&#039;m just being a whiney bitch about having to abuse the &quot;search&quot; feature so much.<br /><br />

We already have a relatively small community here and it&#039;s better for everyone when as much broad, general information as possible is contained in threads that everybody frequents.<br /><br />However, when using the Search bar, do it from within the forum that you wish to search. Searching from the forum homepage will look through every forum, but searching from inside the Shipping forum, for example, only pulls up results from the Shipping section.<br /><br />You can do the same inside any thread as well - the search bar searches the area of the site that you are active in, whether that&#039;s the main area, a sub-forum, or an individual thread. :)<br /><br />Libertas

				yeah fair enough, i understand how it could break up the forum too much.<br /><br />p.s - you have to be the most patient moderator i&#039;ve ever come across, you always politely answer so many questions from noobs like myself.

				I don&#039;t see how it would be a security risk.<br />Most vendor&#039;s are comfortable publicly displaying their country.<br /><br />Also, if the CIA/FBI/DEA/Internet Secret Gestapo really wanted to find a user to throw him in the gulag, they would devote their government resources to track you down and nail your ass, not knock on every door in Bolivia simply because you post in a Bolivian thread.<br /><br />This is a good idea, perhaps having a continental board for each continent? North America, South America, Africa etc.

We&#039;re all contributing to the fight for personal freedom by sharing ideas and subverting our government&#039;s economies by buying on the black market, so we&#039;re essentially all brothers and sisters in arms - as a result, we need to support each other! :)<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the kind words, by the way; it&#039;s really great to hear it when people notice those kinds of things. Thanks! :D<br /><br />Libertas

				I think there should be a locked sticky, which contains relevant info for each major continent/country. EU, AU, USA, UK,&nbsp; CA, etc... <br /><br />Postal/customs rules, buying bitcoins, etc.. these all vary slightly from place to place.

				Would be glad to see just one thread for my country. It&#039;s a pretty small. Maybe subforum with one thread for each country? There would be differences, like if you are from USA you&#039;ll probably discuss only about postal service in your thread but where I&#039;m from we would be glad to get a chance for new contacts or build up market for our country only via SR. I&#039;ve never seen sellers from the region I&#039;m from. And be able to discuss some issues in my own language. <br />Anyway there are always pitfalls too. So it&#039;s just my thoughts loud out aiming for 50 post.

				i was thinking the same thing. it would be nice to have a section to go where i could discuss buying bitcoins because a lot of the stuff posted seems to be about the US and EU and when i visit the sites they dont apply to me. theres alot of other stuff thats country specific i wouldnt mind knowing as well. i understand what Libertas is saying and its probably the best way to go overall. creating a section for every country would really separate the forum as a whole. maybe create a thread for your country and see if enough people post there it won&#039;t get lost in the shuffle.
