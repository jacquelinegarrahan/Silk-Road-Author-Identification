				Hey all, I just wanted to leave this here to give you my review of JmB after my second time using him.<br /><br />First of all, I was kind of a pain in the ass the second time around, which I feel bad about. I put in two separate orders for cash in mail, and then forgot to place the public key in the encrypted text I sent him via the orders. So I had to message it to him separately. He responded with a kind message and helped me out. I also forgot to include a reference number on one of the orders. Same thing, he messaged me politely and helped me out. THEN I decided I needed some BTC&#039;s quicker so I told him I would cancel one of the orders as soon as I sent one in, and put the cash towards a vanilla (which by the way would have to go to another user because I didn&#039;t meet JmB&#039;s minimum). So I&#039;ve been hassling the poor man, and then he&#039;s not even going to get as much cash out of me! THEN I procrastinated and didn&#039;t actually put the money in the mail for about a week. Eventually, thinking I wasn&#039;t sending anything, he canceled my orders, but by that time I had sent one order. I messaged him about it, and I was very nervous thinking I would never see my BTC&#039;s. He responded again, very politely, and made sure I got my coin. He even felt bad about the mix up so he did it free of charge!! To my credit the first transaction I did with him was flawless, but I felt like a real pain the second time around, and he came through big time. <br /><br />To put it bluntly, JmB is the SHIT! He is polite and will get you your coin fast. He even sends you a message with the price at which he exchanged your USD&#039;s for BTC. I would highly suggest him to anyone, he is hands down the best option for getting coin to SR IMO.
