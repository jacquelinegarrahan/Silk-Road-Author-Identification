				Let me start with the short version for those who don&#039;t wish to read my entire experience. The shipping was very fast, I ordered on Wednesday and received it on Saturday. Packaging was great and the quantity on point. ILF was extremely friendly, and their service has made me a permanent costumer on this site (this was my second transaction).&nbsp; I would recommend for anybody who wants quality ecstasy. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This was my girl and I&#039;s first time trying XTC, she wanted to give it a try and I thought &quot;Why not?&quot;. ILF was happy enough to sell to a newbie and the product was in transit the next day. Upon receiving the product, I broke it up in 10 .1 gram piles and proceeded to load about 2 doses into a syringe. This being my first time, I wanted to get blown out of the water, and after doing some research plugging ~200 mgs seemed to my best bet.<br /><br />My girl, being completely inexperienced with drugs, settled on taking a dose and half orally. After she did what she had to with my rear, I laid in bed fighting the urge to shit and after about 5 minutes turned on my xbox to pass the time. I didn&#039;t even get into a game before I got slapped in the face with MDA&#039;s gentle breeze of euphoria.<br /><br />5-10 mins - Everything suddenly sounds oddly muffled/distant I tell her I&#039;m feeling weird and notice my eyesight is slightly blurry. It&#039;s almost like I can feel the hairs on my skin.<br /><br />10-15 mi - I put The Walking Dead into my console but by the game finishes loading, I have no urge to play it whatsoever. I remember thinking the game was too gory, I wanted something less intense, so I go play minecraft instead. Once again, before the game even loads I change my mind. At this point I&#039;m blowing up with some very nice visualizations. I sit there for a good 3 minutes, listening to the minecraft music and spinning around in a circle, not sure where I am, what I&#039;m suppose to do or why all the blocks keep moving. After a little while I start talking to a friend over party chat... he can tell instantly that I&#039;m fucked up. &quot;I&#039;ve never heard him so relaxed before, it&#039;s nice&quot; he tells my gf when I give her the headset, before rolling back into the bed completely enveloped in my high.<br /><br />The next 3-4 hours: Unfortunately my gf didn&#039;t get anything at all out of the experience. She&#039;s currently taking SSRI&#039;s and apparently it counters the effects of XTC. This, of course, is of no fault to ILF or their product, but it&#039;s a shame as she was the one who wanted to get the drug to begin with. <br /><br />Anyways the rest of the night consists of a lot techno playing, glow sticks and teeth grinding. My eyes start to wobble to the extreme, but its oddly pleasant. This makes it very hard for me to focus on anything. The bruxism was unbelievable... I couldn&#039;t stop grinding my teeth if I wanted to. It&#039;s a great thing I got chewing gum and would recommend it to anyways who may try the product, my jaws were very sore by the end of the night. Visualizations were plenty, pleasant and obvious. By obvious I mean there was no confusion about what I was seeing, I was very aware they were hallucinations, which can be difficult to do on some psychedelics. <br /><br />The best part of the experience was how open I was with my GF. We have a great relationship but it&#039;s hard for me to open up emotionally (bad childhood) and MDA allowed me to tell her the things that would be difficult otherwise. We had a very emotional conversation filled with a lot of cuddling, kissing and massages. I would get this product again just for the freedom I had expressing myself to her. <br /><br />The comedown: It wasn&#039;t bad. I&#039;ve read that depression&#039;s a problem but I didn&#039;t have any issues. I didn&#039;t get much sleep but it wasn&#039;t unpleasant, I spent most of the time lying in bed, moving my legs around and playing with glow sticks. The next day I still wasn&#039;t completely sober. My eyes would wobble every once in a while, and I&#039;d melt any time my gf touched my hair or rubbed my back. I don&#039;t think I was completely sober until that evening, which wasn&#039;t a problem for me.<br /><br />The next day we tried again with my gf by plugging her with a much higher dose. I put about 300 mgs in, but still with no avail. She reports some blurry vision but nothing close to the experience I had. I feel bad because I know she would have enjoyed herself tremendously but I guess that&#039;s the way the dice rolls sometimes. If anyone knows of any drugs that give a similar experience but work with SSRI&#039;s then let me know.<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for some XTC then try ILF, you won&#039;t go wrong.

				I&#039;m not sure what the exact mechanism is, but some people for some reason don&#039;t get much effect from a normal dose of MDA or MDMA. I have a friend who is like that, and he usually gets a good roll off of methylone, which is&nbsp; what most of the &quot;molly&quot; in my area actually is (actual mdma is only occasionally available). I&#039;d recommend having your gf try some, it&#039;s not quite the same, but it&#039;s the closest substitute. Methylone is a lot cheaper, too. Try maybe 150mg for a first time. <br />Anyway, nothing really compares to pure MDA, which is my personal favorite. I just ordered some from ILF, and can&#039;t wait to try it again. :-)
