				For dependability and a variety of prescription drugs - Mom n Pop Stuff. I swear they must be sitting on the tube and ship when the order hits it! Freaky fast shipping!<br /><br />For meth - Same dependability as MnPS - hammertime! Honest - doesn&#039;t use! And like 2 to 3 days from order to arrive! Quality? Always okay to good. Excellent meth is a crap shoot in Silk Road!<br /><br />Pot - when they have it - Mom n Pop Stuff again! They package it in crush proof containers and even place tiny bubble - bubble wrap in between the buds so the trichomes with their golden globs of the essences - don&#039;t get pumped around! Stuff is always perfect when it arrives and I live in Alaska! Uusally 4.5 to 6 gram 8ths! They either have a broken scale or lean heavy when they weigh! Lol.<br /><br />

				So far I&#039;ve successfully ordered from two and both were good.<br /><br />My favorite was Chemicalbrothers. I was a little worried because they asked me to FE. But it was a small amount, so I was prepared to lose it and suck it up. But the order came really quickly and the stealth was great. Ordered the green androids.<br /><br />Half had me stumbling around at a rave, smiling at everyone and dancing with myself. Really great time. Shared with some others and they were floored. Definitely 200+ as advertised.<br /><br />After that I had an order from technohippy. They took a lot longer than I thought they would, but it was still less than a week to EU. Ordered five ninja turtles. Also good stealth, but maybe a little less convincing than chemicalbros. The ninjas weren&#039;t as strong as the androids (which I was expecting, they weren&#039;t advertised as anything out of the ordinary), but two carried me through the night, even after my tolerance was up from two nights before with the androids.<br /><br />Overall I&#039;d recommend both.
