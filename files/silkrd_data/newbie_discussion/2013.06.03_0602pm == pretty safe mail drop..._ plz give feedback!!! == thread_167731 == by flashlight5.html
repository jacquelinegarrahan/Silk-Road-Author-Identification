				plz give me some feedback on the idea for this maildrop... im writing a book and would like to know if u think its safe<br /><br /><br />you look up a local carpenter with some kind of shop and call him.<br /><br />Carpenter: Hello This is Jones Carpentry<br />You: Hello, this is Some Guy. How are you?<br />C: Fine, you?<br />You: Doing good. I am actually calling for a shelf get get for my wifes office desk.<br />C: Okay<br />Y: Should be this and that dimenions, less than 300 bucks, blablabla... can you do it?!<br />C: Yes, I can.<br />Y: Great, the color shell be brown, like.. mh, well, like hazelnut, but not that dark, you know?!<br />C: Uhm, well.... <br />Y: Wait, can I send you a sample?<br />C: Sure<br />Y: Great, what address?<br />C: ...<br />Y: Great, an associate of mine will send it out soon, hes done work on the interior design, bla bla bla<br />C: Sure.<br />Y: Okay, can you produce some samples that match that color and I pick them up to see if they fit?!<br />C: Sure ....<br />Y: Please make certain NOT to throw away that sample, we might need it later, bla...<br />C: OK<br /><br /><br />You then place and order. Have the vendor place the product in something (HERE I NEED INPUT PLZ!!!!!!) super glue it close, so it won&#039;t open even when dropped on the ground.<br /><br />For the pickup you can got James Bond like and send a taxi driver to minimize the risk further.<br /><br />Then dispose of the samples, hammer whatever the vendor send open and take your product.<br /><br />If the vendor makes it look realistic i think its fairly safe. also dont think the carpenter would get in much trouble if that thing is intersected.<br /><br />p l e a s e&nbsp; s h a r e&nbsp; y o u r&nbsp; t h o u g h t s&nbsp; !&nbsp; !&nbsp; !

				I&#039;ve read that twice now and I don&#039;t understand.<br /><br />What has the carpenter got to do with the drug dealer? Where does the drug go? Is the carpenter the dealer?<br /><br />You need to explain yourself more clearly.

				the carpenter is the drop. he thinks he receives a &quot;sample&quot; to mix up a specific color for a shelf he will be making. (could be any profession with another story.) <br /><br />that&quot;sample&quot; actually contains your product and comes from your trusted vendor.<br /><br />the carpenter doesn&#039;t know anything. he just gets that thing in the mail and thinks &quot;all right, that&#039;s for that project for the guy that called&quot;. fixes up the samples and puts them aside, together with whatever was sent in the mail.<br /><br />i guess you should pay him 20 bucks &quot;here, take that twenty, i don&#039;t like people working for me without pay. i might not end up ordering that shelf. in case i place the order, we can deduct it!&quot;

You have pre-arranged with him to keep the &quot;sample&quot; for you. You turn up, pick up sample and walk off scott free.<br /><br /><br />I suppose all this is for security. What if the carpenter discovers the drugs, calls the police and they&#039;re waiting for you when you turn up to collect the sample, or when your runner turns up?<br /><br />Lame idea, you need to think it through more. Also, simpler the better. Like someone said, an address/Post Box that you can set up with fake ID. The more complicated an idea the more room for error.

				any1 got a good suggestion on what &quot;sample&quot; to use? should be sth. a vendor got handy...<br /><br />@pak<br />Well, for that case you can send a taxi driver over. Also, as I said, take one with a shop, which means you can drop in at any time. what are they gonna do? keep 2 guys sitting there for a week in case you show up? if you pick the right kind of shop (architecture-wise, area, etc.), i&#039;d still give me an 80% chance of running off and not get busted if they just got 2 guys.<br /><br />in my country getting a po box aint that easy. or actually its easy but requires personal info. but maybe there i a a resource with info that is easy to use... plz share the link!

				that all sounds far to complicated, just use your own address and be careful,&nbsp; if LE are onto the package they&#039;ll just watch it anyway. and the (carpenter or taxi)&nbsp; will sell you out to save they&#039;re own arse <br /><br />I don&#039;t trust leaving my shift with anyone who&#039;s not me!

				Ok, which country are you in? Maybe someone can help you.<br /><br />It is still traceable back to you via the taxi man.<br /><br /><br />If this is for small amounts, just get it sent to your home, or a mate.<br /><br />If this is for large, dealer type amounts, you need to up your game.<br /><br />Keep thinking on it.

				still the stupidest idea ever. why not get it sent to a cake decorator inside of a cake and ask them to put icing on the cake but secretly inside the cake is a balloon containing the drugs and they ice the cake and then when they have iced the cake you pick it up. all you need is a vendor and some icing sugar! flawless!!

				I have a separate idea.<br /><br />Send yourself a bunch of mail with a fake name to your address, get that shit inside USPS computers hard so when you&#039;re getting a package delivered they don&#039;t even check twice.<br /><br />Send it to your own home, once it gets there just write &quot;return to sender&quot; in black ink, now here comes the important part.<br /><br />Don&#039;t return it to the sender! Wait a day and then begin to indulge in your drugs.<br /><br />Or if the cops break down your door instist that you don&#039;t know who &quot;Four T. McSmoke&quot; is and that you were just returning this unknown package.

				For more complicated than it needs to be for anything less than dozens of kilos. This is about 1000X more complicated than it needs to be for what you&#039;re likely ordering.<br /><br />Fake furniture with hidden compartments to hide a few million dollars worth of something would be a good idea though.

				You are thinking about it too much man there are 100&#039;s of easier options available try<br /><br />1.Asking any friends you have working at offices/hotel/shops etc on reception if you can get stuff sent to there address with a fake name on, they keep an eye out for the name when it arrives let you know.<br /><br />2.Place an advert online (gumtree is the main one) asking to rent a room for storage paying £50 a month saying you only need to stay there one night a week. It will always get attention (especially from the crazy&#039;s unfortunately) have everything sent there claim you work nights etc then come in once a week to check.<br /><br />3.Look up local post boxes for rent or P.O box addresses for rent, ring around a lot don&#039;t ask for I.D and are happy as long as you are paying.<br /><br />There are a million more ways but try those if you get stuck message me your situation and I will see if I can think of any ways to help.

				This is a terrible idea. Good in theory but poor in overall design.<br /><br />If Carpenter X lives near you and you contact him about a sample you want to send him. He will wonder why your sample comes from a return address not in your or his area, 1st flag. Your supplier will not be able to send your gear from his location with a return address in vicinity. <br /><br />If he receives a wood sample that is hollowed out or modified to store your gear, he will notice something odd, 2nd flag.<br /><br />You defly don&#039;t have to go through this much thought to make it work. Unless you plan on being The Don.
