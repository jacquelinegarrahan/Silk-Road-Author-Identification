				I trusted him after speaking to him and seeing that he had 100% positive feedback after being a vendor for a year, and so I ordered the btc exchange/purchase via WU and sent him ([REDACTED] in [REDACTED], USA was who it was sent to, and he needed an ID to pick it up, so I thought he&#039;d enjoy me posting this ;)) $650, which he told me he would give me the coin the same night &quot;after he got off work, by 10pm&quot;... That sounded reasonable, but then he kept reading my messages the next day asking what was going on, and not responding.&nbsp; Today I find that he has cancelled my &quot;order&quot;, meaning that not only can I not effect his feedback, but that I&#039;m definitely NOT getting any coin from him...&nbsp; And last Saturday (6/8) was my birthday!&nbsp; I told him this, and he still chose to completely fuck me over!? <br /><br />He is clearly a worthless scumbag, and I just wanted to warn anyone planning on buying shit from him because he makes all of his customers FE, so this appears to be his big score before leaving... Also, I highly doubt that the ONE feedback he has on that BTC/WU exchange listing is real, otherwise he would&#039;ve sent mine too, because I ordered before that..<br /><br />And yes, I know that SR &quot;doesn&#039;t condone&quot; these types of purchases, which if that were really true they&#039;d take the listings down just like the armory, but that&#039;s besides the point here.&nbsp; He is a SCAMMER piece of shit!<br /><br />FML.. What a bday gift! :(<br /><br />I posted this yesterday in the rumor mill, but I also wanted to post it here as I realize many people who would be buying btc from him are probably newbies on the forum (if on the forums at all), and since his feedback doesn&#039;t reflect his true actions, I need to inform as many people as possible about his scam!<br /><br />Please don&#039;t buy SHIT from him--especially considering the fact that he requires FE... It appears that he&#039;s just stocking up money before he dips out, like many &quot;trusted&quot; vendors before him have done.&nbsp; This is not new! Please don&#039;t fall for his bullshit!<br /><br />##########<br />Personal information has been redacted.<br />Do not post personally identifying information on the forums.<br /><br />Libertas<br />##########
