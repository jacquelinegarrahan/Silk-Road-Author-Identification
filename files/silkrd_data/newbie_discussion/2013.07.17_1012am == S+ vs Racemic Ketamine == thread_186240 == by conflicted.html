				As the title says, which do you prefer?<br />I have read a lot about about S+ Ketamine and liked the sound of it, so I ordered some from a trusted vendor on here and I have to say I didn&#039;t rate it much. It has hardly any effects at all before you get to the k-hole, no slightly drunk feeling, no noises patterns or shapes, the k-hole was much more clinical and less weird then on pure racemic, and the whole thing is over more quickly. The only advantage I can see to racemic is that the recovery time is much quicker. Maybe its good for medical procedures but IMO I would prefer racemic any day!

				Exactly, I think racemic is best at home, either with mates or alone. <br /><br />S+ is more useful when you&#039;re out, primarily clubbing. Allows you to stay more with it- and on your feet. Because it doesn&#039;t last as long, if you do overdo it a bit, you&#039;ll be back to real life sooner! Probably not the right attitude but it works for me! <br /><br />I used to think it had hardly any effects but that seems to have changed, maybe I just know that the effects are a bit different now. S+ is definitely much less wonky.<br /><br />I seem to remember S+ holes a bit more clearly-might be bollocks though.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;When I was in America K freaks always wanted racemic because, they said, it had a great body vibe, more psychedelic experiences and a clean, enjoyable hole. When I was in Europe all the K freaks wanted S+ Isomer because, they said, it had a great body vibe, more psychedelic experiences and a clean, enjoyable hole...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can tell K S+ from K S+- by sight usually. K S+, on a molecular level, contains mostly positively charged ions, so the gear clumps together more, while the S+-, or racemic, contains + and - charged ions so they repel each other somewhat. But in terms of effect I don&#039;t know. Sometimes S+ feels one way, and then S+- feels that way another time. Weird drug, god bless it :) AB

				S+ is cleaner while Racemic races into a K-Hole. I prefer Racemic.
