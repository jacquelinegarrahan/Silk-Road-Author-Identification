				hello silk road users!<br /><br />about 1,5 year ago i&#039;ve tested a new substance called &quot;solaris&quot;. it was little white pill, 6 doses of very powerful psychodelic. i was pretty amazed of its effect and decided to find out what substance it is. google told me that &quot;solaris&quot; is a street name for nbome-2c-i. So i start to use it on a regular basis. But about half year ago by seller was arrested and i&#039;ve lost the source of this pills. and decided to buy it here, on silk road. i&#039;ve ordered some amount of nbome-2c-i from tyler durden and after testing it realised that this is completely different substance. It has similar time of action, but starting effects was much harder and visual&#039;s structure was absolutely different. And i liked first substance much better. <br /><br />so, couple days ago i&#039;ve got a chance to buy that old white &quot;solaris&quot; pills. and i want to find out what substance is REALLY inside them. <br /><br />i have heard that there are laboratories which can perform a test for any substance and tell what it really is. Can you please recommend me couple good ones, desirely not very expensive and located in europe. <br /><br />thanks in advance!

				The only one I&#039;m aware of is energycontrol.org<br /><br />Unfortunately, a requirement is you must be a resident of Spain to use their services. At least, last I knew.

				http://www.dancesafe.org/ - US, most popular, pops up at festivals<br /><br />http://www.ecstasydata.org/send_sample.php - US online / post<br /><br />http://checkyourdrugs.com/drugchecking.php - will have a pop up at Tomorrowland festival in Belgium and others<br /><br />http://www.saferparty.ch/worum-gehts.html - Zurich based drop in center and pop ups at festivals<br /><br />http://checkyourdrugs.com/drugchecking.php - Germany drop in centre<br /><br />Of course all of these are primarily for E, but if they&#039;re testing whatever pill properly, it should pick up all adulterants, of which yours will be classified<br /><br />Question is how much do you really want to go to find out? Seems you have to travel across countries to find the answer.<br />
