				For starters, as a vendor I have never even come close to a rating less than 5/5. I&#039;ve been commended countless times on my stealth and shipping, which I must say is top-notch. But now I&#039;ve run into a buyer that reaks of scam. <br /><br />About 10 days ago, this buyer ordered all that I had left in stock for one of my items, a pretty hefty order to say the least. As usual, I sent him a message and thanked him once I dropped his package off to be shipped, and continued on with my sales. <br /><br />A few days later I checked the tracking number, and the order had confirmed that it reached it&#039;s destination. Days continued to pass, and I was under the impression he was just going to let it auto-finalize since he had not replied to anything since day 1. <br /><br />To my surprise, when I logged in the other day he had sent me a message that it had not arrived, and asking if I had a tracking number, or could confirm the shipping address. I told him that I did have tracking, but would rather not dispurse it to him, but would gladly send it to vendor support just to be secure. I then gave him the city and zip from the tracking, but obviously could not supply the rest because vendors are not allowed to keep any buyer info following confirmation. <br /><br />When I logged back in, he had added it to the resolution center, saying he would take half the money back since he did not receive it. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m in a really sticky situation. I have detailed logs containing order info and tracking labels for all of my transactions, including this one, which indeed confirms delivery a few days after it shipped, just like all of my other orders to date. I also ALWAYS copy and paste the address provided by the buyer, so in the off chance that he did mess up his address, that&#039;s on his shoulders. <br /><br />I did my part 100% and am out a significant amount of product, and feel I should not have to refund half of his money when the tracking confirms the package was delivered succesfuly. <br /><br />But then there is my flawless reputation that I have gone above and beyond to maintain. If I don&#039;t refund his money I&#039;m sure he is going to take it out on my reputation, and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s fair when I have a tracking number confirming it was delivered. <br /><br />What do I do?!

				Go to resolution, if all is as you say with nothing but 5/5 and confirmed delivery a few days after order and he came straight out with a 50% refund offer they should find in your favor. I know if I ordered a large amount of product that never arrived I wouldnt ask for a 50% refund off the bat Id ask for 100% in the hope of getting 50% sort of like negotiating well exactly like really

				I somehow missed this originally, but in the resolution I just realized he has only been a member for 21 days and has made 0 purchases. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s game, set, match..

				you should get paid, the resolution centre will see the tracking has it delivered and that should be end of story on the money front, but IDK if this arsehole can fuck your stats with a 1/5 or not. you might want to bring that up with support. i wouldn&#039;t mention it in the res centre as it might be something the buyer hadn&#039;t thought of.<br /><br />if he goes for the cheapshot 1/5 just mention it on your vendor page, out the username and stick them on the vendor blacklist<br /><br />good luck mate! there are some proper wankers out there

				Agreed - I think you have nothing to worry about. Seems SR was built to handle such problems :)

				I believe if you opt to go through resolution the SR admins will side with you based on your outstanding feedback and tracking number, compared to his zero feedback. If he rates you poorly I also believe it&#039;s possible for the SR admins to remove it, but don&#039;t quote me on that.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
