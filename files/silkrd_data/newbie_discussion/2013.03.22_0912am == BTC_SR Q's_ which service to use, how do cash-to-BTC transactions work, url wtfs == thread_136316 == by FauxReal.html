				I know I can find this info on other posts, but how am I to get to 50 posts without posting anything (and I refuse to post non sequiturs on other threads just to do so).<br /><br />Supposedly the most popular BTC exchange service is Mt.Gox, but they have a warning about accessing your account from Tor, which defeats the purpose of having BTC in the first place...<br />So, which exchange(s) allow you the freedom to access your account from Tor?<br /><br />Cash to BTC is probably the safest way to get into the BTC market, amiright?&nbsp; If so, how does that work?&nbsp; If not, what is?<br />Is there any good reason to use more than one BTC service, wallet, whatever?<br /><br />Is the url from the Wiki page seriously the url?&nbsp; I imagined there would be some hidden code or PGP magic involved and that the url is changed daily based on an algorithm only select people know, etc.&nbsp; All the posts I&#039;ve seen say *yes* but the page does not load for me despite using Tor.&nbsp; Is the site down?&nbsp; When will it be up?<br /><br />So I just used http://silkroadxmx45vk4.onion/silkroad/home and it worked... but says new registrations are temporarily disabled.&nbsp; Any idea when this will change? <br /><br />Do you guys suggest purchasing 100% legal things at first to get your ratings up?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t even seen the site yet so I don&#039;t know what&#039;s available but read that there are indeed some legal items sold through here.&nbsp; Do any of you use the site for 100% legal purposes?&nbsp; Do you think telling my friends to use Tor for daily use because it&#039;s extremely &quot;secure&quot; will actually help obscure me from the prying eyes of LE?<br /><br />How are items usually packaged?&nbsp; Can you request sellers to package an item a certain way?&nbsp; For example, I might request an Amazon box because my family and roommates are used to me receiving boxes from Amazon already.&nbsp; Do you actually have (illegal) packages sent to your home address?&nbsp; Does the seller include a return address on packages?&nbsp; If so, what do they usually do?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to those with patience.<br /><br />FauxReal<br /><br />
