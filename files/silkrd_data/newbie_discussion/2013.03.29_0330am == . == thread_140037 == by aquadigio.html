				So this is what you do with your time?&nbsp; Go around judging perfectly acceptable pictures of respectable, hard working men... and accusing other forum members of being pedophiles?&nbsp; Go somewhere else, please... we&#039;re full up on people like that already...<br /><br />No.&nbsp; I do not think he looks like a creep.

				Yah definitely kinda creepy there.&nbsp; Although, he sort of looks like the lonely guy whose wife died a couple years back.&nbsp; He tries to keep it together for his kids, but he doesn&#039;t take time to do much for HIM.&nbsp; <br /><br />BB is a pretty awesome show.&nbsp; i only wish his brother in law wasn&#039;t such a shitty actor.

Did I not say that I was a fan of this actor and love the show? How on earth am I judging an emmy winning actor who I&#039;m a fan of? I just said he looks creepy in that picture, and thats an opinion I have a right to express. Go somewhere else? I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t have to go anywhere. This is an open forum, is it not?<br />Or wait.. is this a case of someone &quot;sticking up for their own&quot;?

It&#039;s been a rough day.<br />3. I saw this thread directly below you asking what to do if you suspect another forum member of being a pedophile.&nbsp; Suspecting someone is never good enough -- an accusation like that is damning whether they&#039;re innocent or guilty.&nbsp; Why even ask the question.<br /><br />So I came to the conclusion that you&#039;re the sort of person I dislike.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s an open forum, most definitely.&nbsp; I have no power to make you leave, but I also have just as much right to express my desire for you to as you have to stay.&nbsp; So that&#039;s what I did.
