				police cannot send you drugs, that is illegal (entrapment) the worst they could do is get you for conspiracy to possess drugs but why would they bother doing that. The only way you will get done by the police is if they intercept a package destined for you and decide to raid that address

				amethyst makes sense. I think they can only try to sell fake shit, like in a set-up, but if they did that on the Road, they&#039;d have bad feedback (except if you got busted, you couldn&#039;t exactly leave feedback too easily...)<br /><br />Just like the bitcoin community, SR is built on trust. I bet that&#039;s why the quality of product is generally so damn high.

				The vendor might not be popo but guess what?&nbsp; Most of the things that five-o are legally prohibited from doing, they use informants for.<br /><br />So although it&#039;s unlikely that a vendor is a narc, he very well could be working for them.<br /><br />Either way, unless you&#039;re ordering heavy, there&#039;s probably not much to fear in that regard.

				By and large, you should be more worried about the prospect of a vendor turning into a police informant after an arrest, although that&#039;s really only going to land you in hot water if the amounts you&#039;re ordering are clearly not for personal use&nbsp; ;)<br />Obviously that depends on what you&#039;re ordering and your jurisdiction - if you&#039;re US you have a lot more to worry about than most&nbsp; :P

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about the vendors being a cop, as long as the have a good track record and have been a member for a while you should<br />be safe ... plus start with small orders and develop a relationship with the vendor to figure out bigger orders...<br /><br />-toplessmind

				One other thought - I&#039;ve always been against the idea of buying packaging supplies on here - especially from the guys that only deal in packaging supplies/legal stuff.<br /><br />What better way to gather intel on the dealers at SR than to infiltrate as a guy who sells them postal supplies? It&#039;s impossible to tell naturally, but it makes me very suspicious.

What I&#039;m taking from this is that everyone is different, and even if your vendor isn&#039;t a cop doesn&#039;t mean that he isn&#039;t a sloppy portion control guy, or misspells address labels, or forgets to destroy customers&#039; addresses. Noone is perfect, but through review threads and feedback we come to get a sense of how vendors do business and even how they respond to mix-ups and errors. That&#039;s why participation is important.

				You&#039;ve always got plausible deniability. You can claim you have no idea where a package has come from in the unlikely event that you are caught. Use a fake name if you can. <br />

				The deniability factor, if I get confronted with something like that I would say &quot;I dunno what that is, it just showed up?&nbsp; Must be some kind of practical joke or something, I don&#039;t even do that shit.&nbsp; What is this?&quot;&nbsp; Even if they claim they know something, cops play head games to get you to tell on yourself.&nbsp; What if a vendor is a cop?&nbsp; Does he have a good track record as a vendor and have quality shit?&nbsp; Maybe he does it as a second job, lol.

				The main worry for me regarding sellers is that they don&#039;t destroy your address after printing it off. I mean they&#039;ve got no reason to keep it and would be idiots to keep records, but you never know.

				You can never be sure.&nbsp; Just protect yourself as much as possible. <br /><br />Just follow the advice on the SR wiki.&nbsp; It should legally protect you enough and give you plausible denial ability.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never sign for your packages and if they ask if you know what is inside the package just say no because you haven&#039;t opened it yet.
