				I use to go through bitinstant but now I get my coins through Blue Sky Traders. Their service is great. The coins show up in your account in about an hour. There&#039;s no need to fake identities like you do for bitinstant. Its about anonymous as you can get.

				I was using Bitinstant before things got a little funky with them. Read around the forum and learned about &quot;Bitfloor.com&quot;. <br />Opened a an acount using only an e-mail address. Deposit money in Bank of America. Money goes into your account1,2,3.<br />Then you have to trade (purchase) to get BTCs ,either by Market order or limit order. Market order,the transaction is quicker in terms of the actually purchase but the minimum amount is 5BTC at a time. Limit order you can trade for any amount(1,2,3,4etc.),but it takes 24hrs and you get a better rate of exchange. Hope this helps.<br />MarcoRuas(king of the streets) 8)

				&nbsp;I have always used money gram to zip zap to bitinstant to mtgox to sr. With all of this the total price cost around 14-15 dollars on 500$ and the longest it has taken was just under two hours, but most of the times it happens in under an hour. I would like to find a vendor that would trade but haven&#039;t found one cheaper than the process above..But reading some of the posts that are taking days to get the coin into your wallet blows my mind. When using the CVS money gram they have never verified my ID, because the info I have given does not match I ID and never have they pointed that out. Love the lazy cashiers..

				If you would like to do it completely online, and have the patience of an adult. Set up a dwolla account and have your account verified (this is why you need the patience it takes 30 days). But then you can send money directly from your bank to dwolla, then directly from dwolla to mtgox, and from mtgox to your SilkROad wallet. I can buy bitcoins with no problem without ever leaving my desk.

				Used Blue Sky Traders recently for the 1st time. Was easy... just emailed how many BTC I wanted, they replied right away with exact cost and account #. took my cash to Bank of America and asked to make a business deposit. The teller cheerfully took my cash, looked up the account, filled out the deposit slip, gave me a receipt. No questions, no ID. Less than 1hr later the coins were in my wallet. <br /><br />Of course if you&#039;re not near a BoA then this isn&#039;t an option. <br /><br />

				If in the US, coinbase.com is easy.They verify you via bank info, then do a transfer from your acct, it takes 6 days though. Or Blue Sky Traders, they are very anonymous. You make a cash deposit in their Bank of America acct, (they provide the acct number and the exact amount needed for whatever bitcoin amount you need (has to be at least $100), Anyway, I made a deposit and by the time I got home (45 min), the bitcoins were here in my SR acct. They are super fast and very nice to work with. Hope that helps.

				I have used Dwolla to Bitinstant to Bitstamp and ZipZap Moneygram to Bitinstant to Bitstamp.&nbsp; But the last two times, Bitinstant seemed to be having network problems and I had to email tech support.&nbsp; Problem was fixed both times within a day but its a hassle when you want to order and don&#039;t have coins.&nbsp; I am going to try Moneypack next time.

				Yo! I just used bitfloor.. Shit was easy and fast! I am in a major downtown area, and I just walked 1 block over to the bank.&nbsp; 10 minutes later, I check my account and my deposit was there.&nbsp; No IDs, simple, and fast.&nbsp; I hope they stay around for a while.&nbsp; Now it is time to play!
