				I would like to hear from anyone who has had a problem with LSD not being terribly effective due to medication they are currently taking....<br /><br />I know that certain anti-depressants will effect a trip.&nbsp; What about medication for seizures?&nbsp; Epilepsy ? Pain medication ?<br /><br /><br />mm

				Benzos counteract the effects of LSD. They are prescribed as antipsychotics, anticonvulsants (anti-seizure), anxiolytics (anti-anxiety), and sleep aids.

				Nope not epileptic.... But a number of years ago I had some seizures out of no where..... doctors put me on a anti-seizure medication called Keppra.<br /><br />I have had problems in the past with acid not being effective and I am trying to narrow it down to what is causing the problem.&nbsp; I have not had a seizure in over 2 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Doctors want to keep me on the medication for the rest of my life.... even though they dont know what caused the seizures.&nbsp; Does that not sound a bit strange.&nbsp; Ummmm sorry Mr. Joe blow.... we dont have an answer for you as to why you have had these seizures.&nbsp; Here take these pills for the rest of your life and all is good....<br /><br />Um.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; All to often doctors throw drugs at a problem that they just cant identify.&nbsp; Anyways guys thanks for the input.....<br /><br />Yep I took 30 tabs of acid and nothing happened..... oh wait that was stiff neck.&nbsp;

Based on my googling, Keppra (levetiracetam) is part of a group of drugs whose mechanism of action is very poorly understood, so there&#039;s no telling how it might affect LSD.

				Weed works great with LSD , especially when coming down, it&#039;lll perk your fry back up.<br />Booze just seems to run right thru ya with little or no effect.<br />Meth seems to make your trip go badly.
