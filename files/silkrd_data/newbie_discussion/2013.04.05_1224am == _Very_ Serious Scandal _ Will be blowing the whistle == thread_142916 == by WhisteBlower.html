				Ok, so we blew the whistle off the &quot;price fixing&quot;/&quot;Cartel formation&quot; scandal that had people in an uproar and had a lot of vendors with egg on their face. And we were right. We have little birdies everywhere.<br />Now, we are debating whether to blow the whistle on a few very serious events that have been going on around here. On one hand it could cause a bigger uproar then the last whistle blowing we did.. and not sure if the minions would be able to even do damage control with a straight face. On the other hand, we have a moral responsibility.. as there;s a lot of trust in the integrity of the team/leadership/security/anonymity of this place. Suffice it to say it&#039;s been keeping us up at night. Are debating the pros and cons. But this is not sensationalism folks. This is some serious shit.. and if when we blow the lid off this, eyes will pop. We&#039;re just debating within our own team how to do it delicately. Stay tuned.<br /><br />Whistle Blower

				You people realize that the last few days.. there have been some very bizarre happenings around these parts. The scammers and whatnot. But the underlying issue is, a person(s) were able to REPEATEDLY send out messages from account names that are simply blocked from being registered/created. &quot;ADMIN&quot; &quot;SR STAFF&quot; &quot;VENDOR SUPPORT&quot; &quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE&quot; etc<br />Come on, fucking &quot;ADMIN&quot;? Try registering a name using &quot;admin&quot; anywhere in the name. Add a bunch of letters and numbers but keep &quot;admin&quot; in there, and it wont let you register. Let alone with a bloody SPACE in the username. Yet &quot;SR ADMIN&quot; and &quot;ADMIN&quot; were *repeatedly* used. <br />Then the widthrawl system was frozen for a good day, to prevent a massive flight of coin out of here. I am no genius.. but it seems like there are some who might have either figured out some exploit(s), or other possibilities. I think that&#039;s all I&#039;ll say for right now.. I&#039;ve got a lot to think about with what to do with the information I might or might not possess. <br />Ask yourself, my friends, how were those names repeatedly being used. And I mean repeatedly, even up until today. Ponder. Think. Dig. Ask yourself some questions that might present some ugly answers.<br /><br />I know a lot. But that&#039;s because I have &quot;birdies&quot; that tell me things.

				Fair enough, but &quot;SR Admin&quot; or &quot;SR Staff&quot; or &quot;Vendor Support&quot; or even just &quot;Admin&quot;..... <br />cmon people. There is no reason why those are being continuously being passed around like peace pipes. Try to register &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;security&quot; @ Gmail or even an ESP on &quot;our side&quot; such as Tormail. <br />Fuck no! You&#039;ll get stopped right at the registration process and sternly told &quot;You can not register names containing X Y Z&quot;<br /><br />Smokecrack (and MANY OTHERS) echoed the same thing.. the fact that it keeps happening and just the other day resulted in a massive scam. Blocking the Bitcoin address that is being used to scam is only putting a bandaid on something. (And yes, I&#039;m positive thats the only temporary work around that they&#039;ve implemented). But without clamping down on the ROOT cause, scammers will continue to do this and scam newbies until SR blocks the wallet address that&#039;s being used. Is that an adequate solution? <br /><br />(Full disclosure. I&#039;ll just come right out and say it. I don&#039;t know any of the scammers, but I *do* know someone who figured out how/why this is happening, and they were the one that told me that the only fix SR has put in place is that when a scam is perpetrated and reported, they quickly put the scammers BTC address into a field titled &quot;Invalid&quot; as if it was an... invalid address. But that is NOT a proper/professional fix. &quot;Admin&quot; or &quot;Staff&quot; will just pull the scam again and again a few days later on new members and this will keep happening. And yes, I said it. I know someone who knows why/how its happening and what the PROPER fix should be. I&#039;m saying that publically now).

				The only reason&nbsp; he &quot;worked it out&quot; was because I saw both the thread where the solution to the scammers was posted and the thread he posted to saying he was getting an invalid account error when he tried to transfer money and thought they could be related (put any software fix in and there&#039;s bound to be bugs).<br /><br />The solution is elegant as a short term stop as it does mean that no money can be sent.&nbsp; Those bulk emails that the scammer sends out can be deleted but if someone has already read it and has it open in their browser then they&#039;ll never know until after the money is transferred.&nbsp; It&#039;s way too late then.<br /><br />Yes, it appears that there was a bug and he was impacted but really, the solution is the quickest way to protect people while they deal with the scammer account..&nbsp; after all, the scammer never tells people to drop the bitcoins on him, he always gives an address to send it to.&nbsp; I can think of no other way that could quickly stop that address from receiving money.

				Abby - thats all good and fine, but you&#039;re missing the point. He *KNOWS* unequivocally how these guys are temporarily using names like admin/staff/support/customer service etc for purposes that are obviously intended to defraud. I know this for a *FACT*, because he proved it to me today (and someone else who unwittingly&nbsp; became used as proof). Do a search, some random gentleman today said he got a message from Admin and then when he tried to message the guy back, he deleted the admin account. Do you think that is normal? Or in any way should be overlooked? *NO*!<br /><br />I think people are not understanding the issue.&nbsp; Smokecrack and other forum members know what Im talking about.
