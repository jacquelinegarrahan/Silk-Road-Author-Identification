				Hey guys after going through much praise for Tesselated i made my first purchase for a ten strip on the road ~50 days ago.<br />First he marked it as shipped before actually shipping it and then sent me a message 5 days later. I did not receive the package before the auto FE period ran out, so i confirmed if it was on it&#039;s way and decided to FE due to his reputation.<br />I waited for a month and now it&#039;s been 50 days (I gave him an update every week) and i still don&#039;t have it so i decided to ask for a refund on Friday.<br />In order to provide a refund, he said he required the transaction number but this is not displayed on my transaction history for some reason. <br />I can see the feedback i have left for him on my profile (which cannot be left if u don&#039;t purchase). Also under my transaction history you can see that i have spent 9.98 BTC on the road, 3.80 of which i paid for XTCEXPRESS&#039; grenades (which i received two weeks back)<br />So i had paid 6.18 BTC for the ten strip. Tess has been co-operative and responds to all messages but at this point i just want a refund and order from someone else but he says he can&#039;t help me if i can&#039;t provide the transaction number.<br />So does anyone know how to go through with this. What might be the reason the transaction # is not displayed ? Does the road delete this after a certain period or is it not shown since the listing is down.<br />Here&#039;s a clearnet link to my feedback, transaction and stats. http://lookpic.com/O/i2/514/MSWmv4de.jpeg<br /><br />

				Did you report the vendor using the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on their profile?

				Also, unfortunately, since you finalized early, there is nothing SR Support can do for you to get your money back.&nbsp; They can only offer support for that when you remain in escrow - which is in place for your protection and the vendor&#039;s protection.

				Those are kind of your only options - either to get the vendor to reship or refund your order, or to report the vendor if he took your money and never sent out the product.
