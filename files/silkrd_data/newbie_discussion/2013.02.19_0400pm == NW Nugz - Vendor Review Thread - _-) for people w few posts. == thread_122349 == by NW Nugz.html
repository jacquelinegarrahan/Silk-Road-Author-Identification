				&nbsp;Welcome to NW Nugz Review Pages for people with under 50 posts !<br /><br />We are new to SR but not to Farming great buds. We intend to be a favorite vendor by providing exellent service, great products and accurate descriptions. We expect to be offering medical-grade marijuana grown indoors by professional growers. We only ship within the USA.<br /><br />Our SR Vendor page is here:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6dec1f7750<br /><br />Most recent News is likely to be found in the last few posts of our main Forum thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116945.new#new<br /><br />If you are having trouble logging into SR, see my tips below.<br /><br />We ship with MBBs for top of the line stealth.<br />We have received glowing reviews. :-) &quot;it&#039;s incredible weed for an incredible price&quot; and &quot;an absolutely excellent experience with NW Nugz&quot; are some of our favorite quotes. Thanks so much to the reviewers for taking the time to comment on their experiences.<br /><br />I hate to require FE, but, we do for accounts with low purchasing stats. Now that I have some history and great stats/feedback, a lot of new buyers don&#039;t seem to mind FEing to get themselves started up.&nbsp; Also, If you are new to SR, feel free to ask questions in this thread about the basics of buying on SR. I like to help out when I can :-)<br /><br />I think most people just encrypt stuff when hiding their address and name in orders. You can encrypt anytime if you want though.<br />For encrypting messages to us, here is our PGP Public Key:<br /><br />NW Nugz&nbsp; Public PGP Key (Always best to Encrypt your Address when ordering):<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg786098#msg786098<br /><br />************ Tips for accessing Silk Road when it is hard to get onto due to Tor Network congestion ***********<br />For those having trouble logging into SR, realize it may take multiple tries and expect more trouble during the USA-daytime. I have been able to get on SR regularly. No trouble vending effectively when SR is up.<br />The tips and tricks:<br /><br />Make sure silkroad is allowed on noscript (may not really matter)<br />Go to a Https website (you trust) in a browser tab to make sure you have a good Tor connection.<br />Once it loads fully, then, pretty quickly attempt to load SR on a different tab.<br />Once you do so, do Not look at any other tab until SR loads. Keep you mouse curser on the page SR is about to load on.<br />Keep the cursor moving on that page (apparently, if you click over to another tab or stop moving your cursor, The page gives up trying as hard to load as it assumes you are not really there anymore).<br />Be patient and keep trying if it does not work. I don&#039;t think clicking &quot;try again&quot; (on a failed connection page) works as well as hitting a link/bookmark, or, &quot;go&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; in the address bar. It is annoying to be patient, but, if you get in it is usually a lot quicker afterwords.<br />If this is not working, even when you are patient, you can try right clicking the green onion icon to try a &quot;New Identity&quot;.<br /><br />If you get to the log in page and the captcha has letters but no numbers, reload the page until it has both.<br />Once you are in, stay active or you may start to get a slower and slower connection. If that happens, be patient and speeds should pick up again.<br />If SR gets really, really slow; look forward to getting logged out and having to re-log in. I think of that as SR (or Tor?) clearing out the bots. Afterwards things usually run fast again.

				Yes, Spok, I will :-) <br />Copied from:<br />&nbsp;NW Nugz - Vendor Review Thread - :-)<br />« Reply #10 on: February 09, 2013, 06:21 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />So I got my sample, today, and I&#039;m very impressed to say the least. The &quot;2 gram sample&quot; ended up weighing a 2.8, which I am very thankful for. This was definitely the best deal on bud I&#039;ve ever gotten in my life. But anyways, here goes....<br /><br />**Shipping 5/5** Was processing for 2 or 3 days, which is fairly reasonable anyway, but considering NW is just getting started and all, the very minor delay was more than understandable. It was definitely actually in the mail once it was marked &#039;in transit,&#039; as it got to me 2 days later.<br /><br />**Packaging 5/5** From the exterior, the package is very professional and legit looking. Interior could use a bit of work(I&#039;ll send PM&#039;s if I think of anything), but it&#039;s fine for domestic. Product is put in a zip-lock bag and then triple vac sealed. Couldn&#039;t smell a thing neither before or after I opened the package...<br /><br />EDIT: Did some research. I can&#039;t give details because it would be too much info, but I discovered something that let me to want to change my stealth rating to a 5/5, so I did.<br /><br />**Product 5/5** ...However, once that last vac seal bag got cut open, the smell went right through the zip-lock back and smacked me in the face. I disagree with what it says on the listing about the smell not being strong. I think it&#039;s pretty pungent. It has a pretty pleasant smell of fruit with a hint of ammonia. The buds are a very light lime green with orange, yellow, white, and a few dark red hairs. The trichromes are plentiful and beautiful. I mean it, this is some frosty ass bud. The buds are really dense also, I couldn&#039;t tell that I got so much extra until it was on the scale, the readout really took me by surprise. The smoke is a bit harsh on the way in(and out sometimes,) but leaves a fiercely sweet, pleasant aftertaste in your mouth after the exhale. The high definitely reflects the sativa dominance. I feel no lethargy whatsoever(T+1 hour) and feel a relatively clear headed mental stimulation.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think this is definitely the product of a grower who is getting seeds/clones with incredible genetics, and knows what the fuck he is doing. And considering the quality of the bud, for the prices NW Nugz is charging, you are getting a steal.<br /><br />**Communication 5/5** Sent some PM&#039;s about some relatively unimportant things, but the responses were very quick, and NW seems to conduct himself in a professional manner.<br /><br />***Overall 5/5*** To make it as succinct as I can, it&#039;s incredible weed for an incredible price. Depending on where you are in the country, you could get a QP and mark up each ounce by like 75% and it would still be a reasonable price for the quality. I would never go that big but I just thought I would throw it out there for someone who would.<br />« Last Edit: February 09, 2013, 06:45 pm by monrovia »<br /><br />Ballz&#039;n&#039;Blargh&#039;s Reliable Reviewer: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92599.0<br />

				Our second review :-)<br /><br />Re: NW Nugz - Vendor Review Thread - :-)<br />« Reply #11 on: February 09, 2013, 08:55 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />listen NWN. if you&#039;re flirting with me, it&#039;s working.<br /><br />I was one of the extremely fortunate reviewers selected for a sample of this fantastic specimen of cannabis science. from the very start, NWN was incredibly friendly and communicative - he had all his ducks in a row, his PGP set up and all that good stuff seasoned buyers insist on. though a slightly longer ship time than expected, it got coast to coast in ~4 business days, and arrived safely in my post blending in easily with the everyday junk.<br /><br />let me just take a moment to comment on the packaging. like I said, perfectly beige with the regular mail, and labelled appropriately. very effective packaging - no smell detection at all until the last layer of defense, and I personally appreciate it when a vendor gives me a reminder of what strain I&#039;m smoking on the packaging. I know some of my colleagues here will disagree, but I feel that it can be &quot;risked&quot; if it&#039;s on the innermost and hardest to see layer. I digress.<br /><br />had to check my scale for accuracy a few times, because homeboy told me to expect 2 grams and my scale keeps showing 3.55 - someone knows the real way into a woman&#039;s heart. the product is also perfectly intact thanks to smart packaging, and it&#039;s quite fresh considering the trip it took (I know I don&#039;t look that good after a cross-country flight ;)). I&#039;m sampling the HeadLight EMP, a beautiful light green flower with petals of pale yellow here and there, and plentiful brown pistils.<br /><br />I could tell immediately upon grinding it just how fresh and how good this stuff was. as the vendor states, I don&#039;t get an overwhelming smell, but certainly a pleasant one; lightly pine with a bit of a kick at the end. it&#039;s so fresh it doesn&#039;t grind into crumbs like most bud - it&#039;s still grinding into petals and shake.<br /><br />the smoke is fantastic for an anxiety sufferer like me; it&#039;s heady enough that I&#039;m not constantly on edge, but nowhere near laying me out or even making me particularly sluggish. after reading my buddy monrovia&#039;s review above, I took a risk and am hitting this bowl before taking my pup to her training tonight. I&#039;m pleased to report that I&#039;m experiencing a similar high - I&#039;ll definitely be able to be out and about with this in me, and I&#039;m betting it&#039;ll make the world a bit easier to tolerate, too. ;)<br /><br />overall, an absolutely excellent experience with NW Nugz, and I know that if quality and service remain at this caliber, I&#039;ll be back many more times. thanks again, and welcome to the Road NWN!<br /><br />A Ballz&#039;n&#039;Blargh&#039;s Reliable Reviewer : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92599.0

				I believe this was our 5th review (by Boonanny) on Feb 15:<br />Quote-<br />Review of NW Nugz and their Headlight EMP:<br /><br />I received a VERY generous sample of EMP from NW NUGZ this week and after an insane work week I have a chance right now to take a close look and take a taste of this fine looking Sativa heavy hybrid.<br /><br />Pictures:<br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/images/80cdc19a62d076e7f1fee5e4ecde094b.jpg<br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/images/dc2265b3c0fd0f514d5e585755c4fbd0.jpg<br /><br />Communications:<br />Really quick and professional in PM and on the forums.&nbsp; Within hours of our PMs there was a stealth listing up, and the next day it was in transit.<br />Then on the forums They&#039;ve been patient and cool.<br /><br />Shipping:<br />Fast reponse times from the order and then fast shipping once it was in transit.&nbsp; Just 3 or 4 days total from west coast to east coast US.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />A little different than what I&#039;ve seen before, and actually really good.&nbsp; Definitely went the extra mile for quality packaging and it makes a big difference in both the stealth and the condition the buds were in.&nbsp; There was not even a hint of compression on these buds.&nbsp; They look like they came off the cover of high times or something.... but I&#039;m getting ahead of myself.<br />Small USPS white Box (instead of bubble mailer) with professional looking printed labels.&nbsp; Inside there was padding to keep things still and a nondescript visual barrier.&nbsp; No smell whatsoever inside or outside the box.<br />Inside the visual barrier is three layers of standard heat sealed bag, with enough air pressure inside each one to really pad the bud and keep it in pristine shape. <br />No smell that I could detect inside the 1st and 2nd layer, but on the final layer I could JUUUUST start to detect a hint of weed smell. <br />Inside the final heat lap layer is a nicely labeled half size ziplock filled with a very generous portion of this EMP, with a nice strong scent.<br /><br />Quality:<br />The nugs were big and plentiful and fluffy looking and oh so white and frosty.&nbsp; I am inspired and might get out the camera and try to take some pics.&nbsp; The bag was full of orange hairs, and the buds vary in color from very light green to darker green, all the way up to snow white with frost in places. <br />The smell is not as overpowering as some I&#039;ve had - its more subtle. Very sweet and fruity and musky, but not super strong smelling and doesn&#039;t fill the room when you open the bag.&nbsp; The buds seem nicely cured, not overly dried out and not crispy. soft and spongy to the squeeze and only really sticky when you pull it apart.<br />Really nicely trimmed by the way.<br />Broke off a chunk, and it breaks apart quite easily.&nbsp; Decided to test it in my Herbalaire vape at about 375F.<br /><br />High:<br />ON the first small inhale I could tell this was special stuff.&nbsp; On the exhale it was really sweet like a weed flavored candy or something.<br />Second hit, a bit bigger... feels smooth, tastes good and yeah, a really nice exhale flavor.&nbsp; A few seconds after the second inhale I could already feel it in my temples and coming up my back and shoulders.&nbsp; Uplifting, heady, but still a nice little body effect.<br />3rd hit... unintentionally HUGE.&nbsp; Oh man. You know its dank if a regular hit on a vape can make you cough out. Or maybe I&#039;m a willow, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Anyway, wow.&nbsp; By the time the 3rd hit was going out, this stuff was hitting nicely.&nbsp; Strong body buzz in the chest and face and eyes.<br />So - yeah great flavor, beautiful bud, fast smooth nice heady sativa high.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Very very good experience.<br />NW Nugz = Great communication, great packaging + stealth, fast shipping, beautiful bud, well cared for in every detail. <br />EMP = niiiiiice. One of the prettiest I&#039;ve seen great flavor and a fantastic high.<br /><br />Will be back.<br />« Last Edit: February 15, 2013, 11:25 pm by Boonanny »<br />Report to moderator&nbsp; &nbsp;Logged<br />I&#039;m a Ballz-N-Blargh&#039;s Reliable Reviewer:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=117957.0<br /><br />PM me to get macro pics for your cannabis listings:<br />http://wyxwerboi3awzy23.onion/src/1362188297919.jpg<br />http://wyxwerboi3awzy23.onion/src/1362188647215.jpg<br />-End quote :-)<br />

NW that was a very generous and much appreciated sample!&nbsp; NW communicated with me beforehand and described the bud as being high quality but not too loud.&nbsp; I personally value the smell or loudness of the bud to be of utmost importance because everyone wants the bud that stinks up the whole house when you open the bag even though I know smell does not always indicate potency.&nbsp; Anyway despite NW&#039;s warning that it did not smell that strong, I enjoyed the aroma, a classic mid/top shelf cannabis smell.&nbsp; The buds I received were all pretty equal in size around .7g, light green in color and covered in a nice layer of crystals.&nbsp; When smoked the taste was much stronger than the smell and I could tell there was a nice THC content from the quick onset of a buzz after a few rips.&nbsp; The flavor on the exhale is slightly sweet and peppery and will definitely have you in a coughing fit with a huge rip on the bong!<br /><br />I enjoyed this strain of EMP a lot and still have a bit left thanks to the generosity of NW Nugz!&nbsp; I look forward to more strains in the future and possibly larger listings in the future once you get settled in and established as one of the roads new great cannabis vendors!<br /><br />Ohh yeah and I FE&#039;d becoming the first according to NW Nugz so lets get this war on drugs started my man.. one nug at a time!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

The bud is a medical looking art piece. Apparent as it&#039;s covered with alot of trich&#039;s its easy to assume that the bud has that white crystal coat look like white widow, or its cross of that alaskan thunda-F.<br /><br />Image Link: <br />&nbsp; http://postimage.org/image/elqm4t18b/<br /><br />Smell: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Has a nice strong cannabis tone over the famous sweet like floral scent that this strain gives. Its very reminiscent to the lineage its described as, so this batch is a definite winner!<br /><br />Touch/Feel: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Nice strong structure to these flowers ! Very nice and condense with a lot of bud calyxes that felt to the human touch as like if it were glue :O Really sticky factor , letting me know the watts that went into this were good. I love hand crushing buds and this was no different, i was enjoying its bubbly bud like pieces , that are easy to roll up.<br /><br />Taste:5/5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nice filling smoke, very pungent, and brute, yet has a nice undertone of a sort of sweet fruity factor.<br /><br />Effect: 5/5<br />&nbsp; Really euphoric and energizing, very uplifting and organic as it felt, you can almost get a cerebral exercise with enough smoked to get you tired and shit faced. :))<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping: 5/5<br />&nbsp;Nice shipping time. Perfect seals applied with above and beyond going with 3 air seals. No smell at all. The postage was perfect and printed label on point, with postage exact. The Package was protected in side with shock absorption foam a new to my findings her on SR. :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Overall: 5/5<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Awesome prices, for different options available to all price ranges possible. Vendor had good communication and was on time with everything and good turnaround time to questions asked. Going far if quality can stay in this range<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Got a little bit of a New variety:<br /><br />Cherry Cheesecake!<br /><br />This is Tasty and Strong :-)<br />I tried looking up the variety online for parentage. Did not find it exactly. I&#039;d guess it is another Sativa dominant Variety. I&#039;d say it has a heady high with light to medium body numbing. It is fruity-tasting, very crystal coated and kinda pinkish with purple parts. There is more stem showing in the buds than with the EMP, however, the small budded variety is more to blame for this than the slightly-slacker trim team. The photo is of one of the 4 Oz&#039;s on offer and you can see it is not badly trimmed :-)<br />Here is the listing with the Photo:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b948a928d9<br />&nbsp;I forgot to ask, but I&#039;m pretty sure it is Organic. I doubt the proper government paperwork was submitted to allow the use of the word &quot;Organic&quot; in this listing. Free the word!<br /><br />When I saw the plants just before harvest, I had to have some. The buds looked very unusual/colorful from a distance. Reddish pinkish kinda explains it, lol. A curiosity for the growers entertainment and you can kinda see it in the dry product. I was supposed to get a LB of it and somehow it mostly dissapeared before I got any. It is popular here. It is a fast finisher and I dont think it yields a lot and so may not be seen much in the future. I&#039;ll try harder to get enough to offer QP&#039;s next chance I get.<br /><br />&#039;Bacon Boy&#039; does good work and I have high hopes of getting more from him very soon :-)

				I&#039;m a shitty reviewer. But Nugz definitely&nbsp; has some good bud, the EMP anyway that is all I have tried yet. Just finished it up last night. Shipping was fast and stealth too. <br /><br />I got a sample of the raw finger hash too with my order and it rocks, first time I tried it I was blown away. I had been smoking hash from another vendor all day the first time I tried it and wasnt sure what to expect but it really surprised me how good it was.<br /><br />Cant wait to try something new from you.

				Thanks for the nice comments :-) I think you review just fine, Lol.<br /><br />Your the first person to mention the hash :-) Glad you liked it. It is expensive so it has not been selling. By the time people figure out how good it is it will probably be gone though as it accumulates very slowly.<br /><br />Thanks for the order :-)

				Guess what I should have said is I&#039;m not the most descriptive reviewer&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Got some of the Sour Diesel last week and it was great just like the EMP. I&#039;m not good with describing smells but this shit STINKS, in a good way. Buds were fluffy and covered in crystals. The high is a great sativa high, awesome for daytime smoking.<br /><br />Shipping and stealth are awesome.<br /><br />I&#039;m eyeballin some of that Cheese now, just gotta get some BTC before its gone.

				Hi again Nugz Buyer,<br />Cashflow and seasonal demand vs supply are my main problems atm. We should have buds again soon :-)<br /><br />Hi mynameis_420,<br />Thanks for the interest.&nbsp; We do not usually list amounts greater than a QP as we usually get small amounts grown legally by medical growers. You can sometimes order more than one QP, but the only discount is free shipping when you get more than one. I can imagine I may get a deal on some great greenhouse/outdoor this fall and have bulk available. I have not heard of a deal like that yet though. QP&#039;s are safer to ship, and I think, receive. We like the QP and under niche most of the time.

				Sales have been slow since the new feedback system removed most of my transacions from my vendor page (only transactions where feedback is left now show up). I have been lucky to find some great bud, so my listings are pretty flush at this time. I just got some great:<br />&quot;Blue Dream&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Hillbilly Clan<br /><br />It is Crystal-coated , fruity smelling, nice orangy-red hairs. Unlikely to disappoint anyone :-) This strain grown by Bacon Boy won this years SR 420 competition&#039;s Sativa category. There are Two different Blue Dreams going around our area. This one is the better one. Organic.<br />So, Of my current bud listings, I think the Deathstar, Blue Dream, Grape Ape and Purple Hogtrain are all especially good choices at the moment :-) All Indoor, soil grown and top shelf :-)
