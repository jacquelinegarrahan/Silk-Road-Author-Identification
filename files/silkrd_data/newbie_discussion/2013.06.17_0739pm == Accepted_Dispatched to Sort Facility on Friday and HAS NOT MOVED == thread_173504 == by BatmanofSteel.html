				Ordered a fairly large package from a well respected vendor on Thursday, it was marked IN TRANSIT on Thursday.<br />Saturday nothing shows up, so reached out to vendor. Vendor said &quot;not sure what USPS is doing with it, but I shipped it when it was marked in transit&quot;. I check the tracking, and it says &quot;acceptance 4:30pm FRIDAY&quot; &quot;Dispatached to sort facility 4:49 FRIDAY&quot;. So I figure, ok... vendor just fibbed a bit and didn&#039;t post it till the next day. That&#039;s fine. Now, it&#039;s Monday and it hasn&#039;t arrived and using a clearnet proxy I checked the tracking.. still has not updated from the last update last Friday. Am I to be concerned? This is a lot of money tied up.<br /><br />Additionally, I had mentioned to the vendor I&#039;m buying last Thursday because I have a flight in a week and a half and will be travelling for awhile. When I asked the vendor over the weekend for the tracking, he had mentioned to give it till this Friday for it to show up or he&#039;ll refund my coin. Now.. can we see the problem with that? I&#039;ve got a flight Saturday morning. I can&#039;t wait till Friday, as that will tie up my funds and not let me order from elsewhere before it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />Any advice on how to tackle this?

				You should always be concerned about receiving drugs in the mail.&nbsp; However, USPS is very often slow lately.&nbsp; The package will likely soon show up.&nbsp; Unfortunately I&#039;ve had priority mail packages take over a week.&nbsp; If the vendor got the package out quickly then there probably isn&#039;t much more that he can do.&nbsp; Refunding your coin after a week seems pretty reasonable.&nbsp; Hopefully it&#039;ll just show up soon.

				Something just occurred to me. It&#039;s possible the vendor didn&#039;t ship Priority as promised, and First Class instead.<br /><br />INFACT, in the tracking on USPS, under &quot;Service&quot; (where in the past I&#039;ve seen it say Priority Mail or Express Mail), it&#039;s blank. Is that indicitave of it being First Class Mail instead of Priority? I&#039;m starting to think that&#039;s the culprit. Not only did the vendor not put it in transit when he said (rather a day later), but he also sent it&nbsp; First Class (but DCN). Thoughts?<br /><br />For example, *CLEARNET LINK*, here is a generic jpg I pulled off the net that shows what a standard USPS Tracking looks like (you&#039;ve all seen this before), and under SERVICES, it says &quot;Priority Mail&quot;. http://i.imgur.com/GI3fcGS.jpg<br /><br />Now, when I look at MY tracking provided by the vendor, under &quot;Services&quot; it is blank, and under &quot;Features&quot; it says USPS Tracking / Delivery Confirmationâ„¢, but not any &quot;Expected Delivery Date&quot;. That is indicative that this package was mailed out FIRST CLASS (with DCN purchased as an addon), instead of via Priority Mail. <br /><br />Am I correct? Andy vendors/buyers with experience looking at USPS tracking can confirm this is the case?

				I seen a news clip where the feds say they supposedly check every single package and take pictures, this might be causing all these delays lately.&nbsp; Specially since SR has grown so much in popularity in the past year, more than ever before.&nbsp;
