				I went to my wallet and clicked the link to buy coin, then bitstant, then zip zap. Zip zap wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; go to the page for sending information.<br /><br />Any one else having the same problem?

				Please give more details. How much is your transaction? Over $500? If yes, then do two transactions. Are you using Tor? What payment options did you choose?

				They have been asking for the phone number for a while. That is how they can pull up your transaction at a money gram agent.

				I sent support an email this morning(about five hours ago)after trying several different browsers and my tablet and got a response saying Zip Zap was working on it.&nbsp; I can get to the page where you choose your payment location and input your phone number, but once I click on the button to create the payment slip, it greys out and nothing happens.&nbsp; Bummer.&nbsp; I hope they&#039;ll have it fixed soon!

				I funded my wallet using my regular method, blockchain/bitinstant and moneygram to zip zap. It worked fine.<br />I&#039;ve had problems in the past though and I just created a new blockchain wallet , WTF they&#039;re free and anonymous so why not, and then everything worked fine with the new wallet.

It worked fine for me today. You are accessing thru TOR right? I could be wrong but it seems to me I had a problem a couple months back and then reaized I wasn&#039;t going thru TOR. Not sure if that really made a diffetrence but it&#039;s worth a try to check.<br />If thats notr it, just keep trying&nbsp; ..good luck<br />
