I also have the same problem with the forums unless i use Tor2Web.&nbsp; :-\. I have had this problem about 5 days.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the error message i get when i try to load Silk Road and the Forums <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br /><br />Unable to connect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Firefox can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy.

				There is something funky with hidden services. Every time I reset tor I have a different set of hidden services not working and a different set working well.<br /><br />I even create a few of my own hidden services and the same pattern. I could connect to some reliably and other I reliably could not connect to. Once restarting tor they were all shuffled.<br /><br />I wonder if someone is fucking with the directory servers.

The Silk Road appears to be up. I was using it 30 minutes ago and the forums would not work. I rebooted tails and now the forums work and the road is down. Both the road and silk road show evidence of constant use.<br /><br />I think the tor hidden service directory servers may be under attack. Not sure but when you reboot your random choice of directory servers probably changes. Try turning tor off then on again.

I downloaded the new tor and it&#039;s not worked since. Ive tried reinstalling it about 3 Times but like you say it could be directory servers may be under attack. Ill try rebooting tor again.

				SR is always slow for me, but for the last few days it has been problematic. I can usually get on eventually by quitting tor and restarting.

				This is not a silk road issue, but a tor issue. See here https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html<br /><br />The linearity of the increase implies that the quadrupling in users is not extra human users, and it&#039;s suspected that a botnet is behind it, the evidence for this being the total bandwidth of the network has not increased: https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html (scroll down to &quot;Total relay bandwidth in the network&quot;)<br /><br />Whatever these new users are doing is causing the hidden services to be slowed to a crawl, while accessing clearnet sites appears to be unaffected.
