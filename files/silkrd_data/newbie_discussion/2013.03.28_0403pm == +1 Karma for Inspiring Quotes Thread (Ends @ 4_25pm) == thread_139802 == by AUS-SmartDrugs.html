				I&#039;m typing from my copy of Atlas Shrugged so please sue me for typos but here goes: &quot;In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who are it&#039;s worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that man&#039;s proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it&#039;s yours.&quot;

				Here are a few of my favourites:<br /><br />&quot;All governments are lying cocksuckers.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you&#039;re high, you can do everything you normally do just as well – you just realize that it&#039;s not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#039;s real because that&#039;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#039;s very brightly colored, and it&#039;s very loud, and it&#039;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#039;t worry; don&#039;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#039;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It&#039;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#039;t matter, because it&#039;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#039;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#039;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.&quot;<br /><br />All by Bill Hicks.<br /><br />Some describe him as a comedian. I say he simply made philosophy funny.

				I was reading Da Vinci. He had a SIMILAR quote to what I&#039;m about to write. I&#039;ve adapted it into my own unique thing though<br /><br />&quot;If it should ever happen in your lifetime, that you evidence a fact for yourself that directly contradicts what authorities have taught or told you for life; you must then abandon any such authority and assume your self-evidenced facts to be true until such a time; that those facts be disproved.&quot;<br /><br />thats why I&#039;m now a vigilante saying FUCK THA PAU-LEASE

				“Everybody in the world is seeking happiness—and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. It isn’t what you have or who you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.”<br />- Dale Carnegie
