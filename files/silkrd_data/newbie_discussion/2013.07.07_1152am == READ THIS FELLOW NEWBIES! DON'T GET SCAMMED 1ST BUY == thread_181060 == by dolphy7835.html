				SHello fellow newbies! I&#039;m not buzzing, so am only a man of few words right now. I hate reading these posts about people being rippped off by vendors. It&#039;s hard enough just waiting for the mailman to run his route, but to open the box up and every time find nothing is too much. Then to realize you&#039;ve been got is the last FUCKING straw.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I just wanted to share with my fellow newbies 2 vendors that i have confirmed by multiple purchases that are honest, friendly and reliable. MDPRO and TERABITHIA.<br /><br />If anybody else has trusted vendors please include them on this thread.&nbsp; Thanks BTW: i am not receiving anything from these vendors and that includes extras on my next orders. I just know how it feels to get fucked over, and don&#039;t want to see that happen to anybody. Especially on your first fucking order. If those two vendors i listed don&#039;t have what you need, make SURE you do your homework on the vendor you buy from.

				Good to know about terabithia because i ordered a package and i finalized early by accident. yes by accident. new pc and mousepad is in an odd position from my last one. it happens often when im emailing and surfing too. i think my palm hits it,idk. anyways, im a dumb ass what can i say. its real annoying regardless. terabithia has been communicative and is in transit. i chose this vendor due to the fact of so many positive feedbacks and a acquaintance of mine suggested terabithia personally. lets hope in a couple to 3 days it arrives! great post of suggestions! relying on reliability... will update soon. ciao

				There are a lot of vendors that are professional and awesome. Trusted, however...<br /><br /><br />ItalianMafiaBrussels seems to be extremely legit. Not many complaints, and he was delivering obscene amounts of MDMA/Coke for a while. <br /><br />Righteous I would say I trust. His Nbom was great, his service was top notch, and I have zero complaints. I just wish he would come back around.<br /><br />

				Finalizing early by accident is pretty easy to do. <br /><br />You only have to click that finalize button and it&#039;s done.&nbsp; It should be done once the feedback is left. Like a confirmation. <br /><br />Good luck :)

Tera put all worries and concerns down. thx for coming through! as many have said, Terabithia is a solid vendor with a solid product. check this vendor out! i ordered 20 of those things and got extras too! so all in all it was great experience and a even better transaction.

				Like my old buddy Rat used to say, &quot;Take free advice for what it&#039;s worth.&quot; ::)<br /><br />Some vendors require you to FE if you have few transactions. I understand, nobody wants the headaches of some jerk that wants to bitch and whine over shit that&#039;s out of your hands, nobody wants their money held up, they sure don&#039;t want some scum bag trying to extort them via feedback, especially if you&#039;re trying to run an illegal business dealing with &quot;anonymous&quot; people. Having said that, I still don&#039;t agree with FE. The money&#039;s there in escrow and isn&#039;t going anywhere until there&#039;s a resolution of some sort (ie. successful arrival and trial, arbitration by SR staff, or buyer/vendor negotiated solution) so why the required FE? <br />I FEd it twice. and product arrived on schedule. One was very light (no I will not say who it was) the other was astounding. This vendor, dragoncove, sent a package I still can&#039;t believe. His H was very good and was well over the gram I ordered. I can and do recommend anyone that wants H to deal with these guys. I ordered another gram and the package was marked &quot;in transit&quot; w/in hours. I ordered from two other vendors the day before, and now, three days later they&#039;re still &quot;processing&quot;...WTF?<br />BTW I ordered from Terabithia earlier and was pleasantly surprised by the service (communication, quick shipping, etc) and the dope wasn&#039;t bad either. Actually, great for the price. If you&#039;re new to SR and want to buy some H, go to dragoncove if you want grams+ or to Terabithia if you want stamps. Both are professional, have good dope, and ship quick.... 8)

				I&#039;ve made 21 orders since I became a member and the experience has been pleasant.<br /><br />My first order was delayed (Over sold, wasn&#039;t in stock), but the seller kept up coms, and I was sent a large freebie to compensate, happy days!<br /><br />Next bunch of orders had all been fine, then I had my first missing package, the seller agreed to resend and I got it all fine! <br /><br />I had one order of coke that was not up to scratch, I complained to the seller, who sent me out .5g as compensation again, I was happy with that!<br /><br />Since then a few orders have been delayed, the worst culprits seem to be the top sellers, and this seems to be because they sell so much they cant manage the work load lol<br /><br />I only buy bitcoins from reputable sources, I read feedback and watch a new products reviews before I order, and of course, these forums are always a god send for information on sellers / scammers!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I just recently joined the Silk Road and placed multiple orders as part of my first one.<br /><br />I placed my first order with AlliceinHolland late Thursday. My package was market in transit as of today. Very pleased with the service I have recieved from Allice, She has communicated even without me asking first to let me know that my order had shipped! Allice gets an A+ so far!<br /><br />I also put in an order with SuperTrips. I know at this point he is pretty much a gamble. I do have friends that have used SuperTrips with success before which is why I was eager to try - Never gotten to try one of those Orange Triforces that look amazing.&nbsp; Anyway, I have confidence that both order will safely arrive to West Coast USA. Unsure if they will be here for HARD SUMMER, but one can only hope as the red ? were awesome at EDC. <br /><br /><br />Hope everyone is having a good day!

				Recently went with MarijuanaIsMyMuse (MMM), a large Canadian vendor form my first purchase. I was afraid I&#039;d be asked to FE but I wasn&#039;t. The vendor simply filled my order and within three working days I received my gear in an incredibly stealthy packaging and that was that. Excellent experience for my first time. Ordering from MMM again. Will report if my experience isn&#039;t as good.

				In my opinion Old Amsterdam is one of the BEST vendors on here. His mdma is untouched and my customers absolutely love it! I roll so fucking good and hard off it. Man, getting excited talking about it! If you are looking for quality and dependability then go to him. <br /><br />Ryno

				Ordered MDMA from Diesel Therapy.&nbsp; Shipping was OK. Stealth OK. Product was legit.&nbsp; When ordering, read recent feedback cause he tends to get off his game sometime. Not a scammer, just think he starts doing too much H or something. I had good first order with him.<br /><br />25i from righteous was excellent all around. No complaints at all.<br /><br />MDMA from Malinov (he said he&#039;s not restocking MDMA though.&nbsp; But good stealth, good shipping time.&nbsp; Havent tested yet but reviews are good.<br /><br /><br />I think the main thing to do when making any purchase is homework.&nbsp; Read ALL reviews, especially the reviews of the product you are buying (if the vendor sells multiple products). Search them on forums.&nbsp; Obsessively.&nbsp; I researched maybe a total of 15 hours on just those 3 purchases.
