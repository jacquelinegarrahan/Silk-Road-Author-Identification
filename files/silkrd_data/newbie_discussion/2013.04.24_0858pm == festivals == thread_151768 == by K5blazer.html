				Saw deadmau5 at UMF this year he was sick I will upload some pictures of his stage later.&nbsp; This summer I am hitting up EDC NY and Electric Zoo so far and I hope to get the funds for TomorrowWorld (the US segment of TomorrowLand).&nbsp; Plenty of clubs to hit up also.

				DEMF (Movement festival) Detroit Memorial day MAY!!!<br /><br />It makes me happy to see you SR users talking about electronic music.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been DJing for about 10 years and have been listening to EDM for about 15. For a minute there (about 4-5 years ago) I was getting concerned that me and my people were going the way of 80&#039;s hair metal fans.&nbsp; I foresaw a future where nobody listened to electronic music and the people that did got made fun of (just like hair metal lover&#039;s who still think its 1986)...<br /><br />I maintain that many of you who are into the more energetic up beat electro house (thats 90% of what Deadmouse#5/Swedish House Mafia plays) will slowly over time come to have a more refined taste in electronic music.&nbsp; I love pretty much all EM but one can only listen to that really intense blowing the roof off type of shit for so long.&nbsp; After a while you will find more minimal/techy house appealing more and more. When I started I listened only to trance/breaks/drumNBass.&nbsp; I still LOVE that stuff don&#039;t get me wrong... Its hard to explain, the only thing I can say is please stick with it, keep listening to what you love and what makes you move.&nbsp; You will all turn to the dark side eventually :)<br /><br />For those into deadmouse and other intense acts I would suggest giving James Zabiela a listen to as he tends to cover alot of different genre&#039;s of EM while remaining very intense and on point.&nbsp; His sets are very energetic but I find him to be a little more tasteful.&nbsp; James Zabiela&nbsp; will go from ambient ---&gt; tech house ---&gt; Minimal house ---&gt; Breaks ----&gt; Electro house&nbsp; etc... His sets are amazing and will definitely take you on a musical journey.&nbsp; Also check out anybody from the Dirty Bird record label (Claude VonStroke, Justin Martin, Christian Martin, Eats Everything..)<br /><br />If you like Breakbeats Hybrid are great producers of really dark and long breakbeats that have a very trancy/electro element to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to PM me for more suggestions on electronic acts/DJs/Producers to listen to!!<br /><br />-Bill Paxton&nbsp;
