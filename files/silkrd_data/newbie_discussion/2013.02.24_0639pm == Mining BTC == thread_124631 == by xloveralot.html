				So today I&#039;ve been reading some about mining bit coins.<br />So far it seems that you need a really good computer. Unfortunately mine is older but it&#039;s interesting to read `on.<br /><br />Anyone here considering mining btc?

				The days when you could make some decent coin with your core-i7 desktop pc are history.&nbsp; These days to be competitive in the bitcoin mining business, you need a specialized parallel processing machine that was designed to do one thing --&nbsp; mine bitcoins.&nbsp; The latest generation of equipment is being rolled out now.&nbsp; They are called ASICS mining machines.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think ASIC&#039;s is an acronym for Application Specific Integrated Circuits.&nbsp; ASIC&#039;s mining machines are useful for only one thing, mining bitcoins.&nbsp; And if you don&#039;t have one you don&#039;t stand much of a chance of making anything mining when you&#039;re up against consortiums who are running dozens of these new machines.<br /><br />Jack

				You need a highly efficient machine to mine today.<br />Even the GPU miners are about to turn into the current CPU miners with the release of all these ASICs.

				Thanks for your reply. Good info. I can only guess how much one of those new machines roll out for.<br />My way of thinking was that even if I could get 1 or 2 btc a month by mining in spare time that would be useful for me.<br />Of course it&#039;s all complicated.

				Avalon ASICs are about $1500 for no less than 65GH/s hashrate.<br />Butterfly Labs has four products:<br />BitForce Jalapeno - 4.5GH/s - $149<br />BitForce Little Single SC - 30GH/s - $649<br />BitForce Single SC - 60GH/s - $1299<br />BitForce Mini Rig SC - 1500GH/s - $29899<br /><br />So as you can see it costs a pretty penny to purchase an ASIC miner (and keep in mind these are early batches if you didn&#039;t buy one early it&#039;ll be a while before you actually get your miner).<br /><br />There are a few calculators around that will help you determine how much you could potentially make running at a certain hashrate (including cost of electricity and a lot of other overhead costs), but these aren&#039;t accurate because we do not know what the difficulty of the network will do when there are a bunch of ASIC miners start up on the network. It&#039;ll become MUCH harder to mine a bitcoin.

				It&#039;s a competitive, efficient industry these days with high barriers to entry by new players.&nbsp; Profit margins after paying for equipment and electricity costs are relly thin or non-existent even with the latest mining equipment.&nbsp; The gold rush ended a year or more ago., and the corporate titans of industry have moved in, taking all the fun out of it.&nbsp; Time to look for a new vocation.&nbsp; Supermodel maybe?

				I agree Jack. There&#039;s many people out there that have server farms run off of solar power so there is no electricity overhead.<br />Also you&#039;ve got all the people with botnets, and the browser based mining systems that run behind webpages.

				Those guys have sucked all the fun and life out of the industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just like the medical marijuana industriial machine is sucking all the fun out of being a grower in California.&nbsp; That why I&#039;m on SR to get some enjoyment out of it again.&nbsp; It&#039;s working too.&nbsp; Nice people who appreciate your products vs. shrewd purchasing managers for the big collectives who talk donw your product to get a better price and you leave with money in your pocket but feeling like you&#039;ve been raped.&nbsp; Now I need another bump of K.
