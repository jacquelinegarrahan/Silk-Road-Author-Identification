				In my enthusiasm to get some weed and my complete ignorance of how much I need, I bought 14 grams of some good stuff from ogbryan. Being new to weed and using a vape, I&#039;m going through it really slowly. I&#039;ve got it stored in a ziplock bag inside a vacuum sealed container. How long will it stay good for?

				I&#039;ve had a few grams store in an airtight jar in a dry dark place (closet).&nbsp; It&#039;s held up pretty well.&nbsp; I heard you want to be careful freezing it as you don&#039;t want any moisture sitting in there with it. But if it&#039;s vacuum sealed you shouldn&#039;t have that problem.<br /><br />I&#039;m still working on the eighth I got a month ago..

				Well, at the rate I&#039;m going, I probably need to find a friend to give some to, then. I&#039;m probably using .2 grams at a time unless my wife is vaping (is that the right term?) with me and then we use maybe .3. And I&#039;m only using 3-4 times a week.<br /><br />And I just ordered 1/4 oz of an indica dominant strain (my current is sativa) because I want to try different types out. Hmm.

				Keep it in an airtight glass jar. Something like a mason jar. Mason jars work fine. Keep it in a cool and dark place and you can store it indefinitely. It&#039;s the exposure to air that makes it age. Weed can actually ripen like a fine wine quite nicely in a glass jar not exposed to light. Best of luck mate!

				if you have a small piece of stick (stem) from your weed while its still moist cut it and store it into your fridge.&nbsp; If your buds get dried out just cut a small piece from the stick and place it in the jar / zip bag and the buds will get re moisten very very fast.<br /><br />potency will not drop even if your buds get dried out completely (assuming proper cure took place before the weed was sold.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Placing your buds in the fridge while they have enough moisture in em will cause mold and probably destroy your weed. Just dry it enough (&lt;30% moisture) and then it will be fine. <br /><br />Every time when harvesting my babies I keep one of the stems just for this reason.
