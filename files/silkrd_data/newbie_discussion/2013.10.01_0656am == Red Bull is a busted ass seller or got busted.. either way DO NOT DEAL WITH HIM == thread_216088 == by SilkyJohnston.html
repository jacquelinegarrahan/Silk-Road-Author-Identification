				Red Bull 4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Red Bull is busted........sorry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take into consideration that this message holds no anger.<br />There is a bit of frustration in turn of an obvious miscommunication.<br />There is nothing in this message negative or against you.<br />It&#039;s mainly all stated for constructive criticism purposes.<br />This message is written to reach some sort of resolution/conclusion in our agreement and transaction.<br />Because, I don&#039;t feel as if any transaction should be left on a bad note.<br /><br />So, I got more news today.<br />Two packages have come in, in total. Both were left with notices for a need of signature.<br />I believe that that is in direct violation of our agreement of a &quot;no signature&quot; transaction.<br />I&#039;m not sure if you simply forgot to not track my orders or if you just didn&#039;t trust that I&#039;d be honest, so you went ahead and tracked them purposefully anyway.<br />Either way, our agreement was that there would be no signature required.<br />As a show of respect of customer/seller etiquette: I would appreciate a response back with your explanation as to why a signature is required (which goes against our agreement).<br /><br />Also, another thing to take into consideration: Your packaging methods could use some work.<br />I don&#039;t know how much research you have done, but glass banging together and the sound of liquid swashing around usually pulls red flags with customs in any country.<br />So, I personally would recommend you do some research, put some time into your work and actually care whether or not the package makes it to your customer safely while at the same time keeping your customers happiness with the transaction and safety in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />Lakshmi &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to Finalize because there is no reason as to why I shouldn&#039;t, even though the notice that I received from the mail man states that it requires a signature.<br /><br />Typically, from previous experiences, they knock, drop the package off and leave, no signature required.<br />However, the notice states that I can sign for it and leave the signed paper on the door for redilivery or I can take the paper, go in, sign for it and pick it up.<br />Either way, a signature is required, which is not our agreement.<br />I am curious if there was some sort of miscommunication between us.<br />Or if you had possibly forgotten to do my packaging differently than your normal drops by making it a &quot;no signature required&quot; delivery.<br />Or if maybe the package was seized and is in being held at the post office for entrapment.<br />I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to have faith in you and our transaction and hope that this one package is just a fluke.<br />All I can do at this point is play the waiting game and see what happens with the post office involving the other packages.<br /><br />Either way, this transaction isn&#039;t big enough for me to lower my buyer rating by trying to receive a refund, so I finalized.<br /><br />Fingers crossed,<br />-ME &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok. The post office tried to drop it off, but didn&#039;t and left a notice, because nobody was here to sign for it.<br />I&#039;m going to try to get them to rediliver without signature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />Red Bull 4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!<br /><br />Yes, thats the number!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Red Bull<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot, here&#039;s my order number. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you send out a package under the number:<br /><br />R@#733+*%#23#E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />Red Bull 4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br /><br />here is the key:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: BCPG v1.47<br /><br />mQGiBFFKPIIRBADYV8HJUk7/l69U8JhUfsVKo/GschACu0rONiR5F7WbFdTZ/FZ0<br />msQH02e7/UCXmromWEcUE19KpDjNyYL0IBdrgjriFHdpINHiHoVZXKdQB9BwvaL4<br />M5TZOQkmbKPnplDXmDeJR/uU4Eo5MhdnxCvESIOcLUo+WM+Qe84Jl+uomwCgssLU<br />0avrHjWlgc4iUuFaEbp7WdcD/1/SCCmfu3q1jgksNSUZnyjfohvMnjRehinuJt2T<br />ZQ5EsTJTNC2bS047D8balhGsFP/lcC5dshipgaHAStFHyD4Ti+vqB+WdwftxgvIe<br />BHhCCiOLxylhtM+4/4HDgma9wAh/tn0JH59Qyo2A6ZHat6hrvBlrHMLoUH6MZMkx<br />zEgMBACUHMcPSd27rzRUHn9N2sz/+DDxWWE+KdJax+REV3Hkb4bJ5mhwvFgfTadJ<br />0gzYe/HO/AWL21nfsQxd9MKi1h2aXNG8aBAfdZCiIOtiRgCy0LCmEfrQEG3SHmz2<br />qi9hpIAtGmsh9WalfEsGoVR7LjIHdyCCiWT/FViI58Igy+9zlrQZUmVkIEJ1bGwg<br />PGNhbGxhZ29Ad2ViLmRlPohGBBMRAgAGBQJRSjyCAAoJEPLQJ1xN3ZoqEmQAnjqv<br />u5WdyM8qOCK9HYTgyphvexMCAJ4tipRjZmrOeF37w107qQd+KfoNnbjMBFFKPIIQ<br />AgCUlP7AlfO4XuKGVCs4NvyBpd0KA0m0wjndOHRNSIz44x24vLfTO0GrueWjPMqR<br />RLHO8zLJS/BXO/BHo6ypjN87Af0VPV1hcq20MEW2iujh3hBwthNwBWhtKdPXOndJ<br />GZaB7lshLJuWv9z6WyDNXj/SBEiV1gnPm0ELeg8Syhy5pCjMAf9L8IkBHDKWjpLp<br />FHQJE20HMHmu4gzPf7bJCchIlwc+cd3SYpcJs0YLoivinjUuSIgXFEVoaRuz4Zsr<br />UAPt5bAgiEYEGBECAAYFAlFKPIMACgkQ8tAnXE3dmiqcCQCdHeDk8Fc+XDLQVFly<br />VOkglvG0jYgAn1IGxb2t7LSGmbeM/ey7nuX5mdzr<br />=oabp<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Usually letters need one week to the United States.<br /><br />Kindly regards<br /><br />Red Bull &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#039;t have a public pgp key on your profile page.<br />Is there a reason for that?<br />And if you do have one, may I please have that, so I can send you my address?<br /><br />I&#039;m also curious on an estimated time of arrival to US as well.<br />Trying to find out which address I should mail it to.<br />I have a lot going on in the next few weeks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />Red Bull 4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, then please place your order!<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Kindly regards<br /><br />Red Bull &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />ME: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.<br />Yea, I would be willing to agree to a &quot;no refund policy&quot;, if that entails that I do not have to sign for anything.<br /><br />This goes without saying: However, I hope that you will take your time and be as secure as possible to ensure to your best possible extent that all items will get to me.<br />((If you feel the need, go the extra mile with shipping, I&#039;d be willing to pay for extra stealth))<br /><br />However, no refund will be expected or asked of you in the unfortunate case of any of the orders not being completely delivered. .<br /><br />If we can do a no-sign order, I&#039;m ready to place the order upon your return response.<br /><br />If I am happy with this order, I&#039;d love to be a fairly-frequent returning customer.
