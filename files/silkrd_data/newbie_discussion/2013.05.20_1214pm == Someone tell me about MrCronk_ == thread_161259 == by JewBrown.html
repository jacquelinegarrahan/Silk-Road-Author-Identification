				MrCronk is a UK weed vendor, seems to do a lot of varieties all with free next day delivery. <br /><br />Anyone tell me anything about him? Anyone bought off him before? Good? Bad? <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a8049ec639<br /><br />Thankyou&nbsp; :)

				Hello!<br /><br />Ive bought the outdoor strawberry kush and thai from mr cronk a number of times.<br /><br />The thai was good, and the strawberry kush is ok, differs from batch to batch but generally is a little seedy. Delivery can vary too, but generally 1-2 days if you get 14g or more.<br /><br />All my orders have arrived well packaged, and my communication with him has always been prompt and polite.<br /><br />Make of that as you will, hope thats been a little helpful.&nbsp; :)

				Ive had about 15 or 20 transactions with MrCronk and while Ive always been happy with the product, its only ever arrived on the next day in one case. He really shouldn&#039;t advertise next day delivery as he obviously cant deliver on this promise. All the packages have gotten through, however. So if you dont mind waiting, order from MrCronk.

				he&#039;s a really good seller, consistant. i&#039;ve always waited 2 days for delivery but that&#039;s never been a problem, it always comes. i had his strawberry kush which is a nice weed. his chocolate thai is ok&#039;ish for the price, but nothing special. i did have a few speckles of weed dust just inside the opening of the bag once, outside the seal, which would have been fatal if a dog had been put on the mail, but it was domestic and arrived fine anyway. double bagging would sort that out.

				Nice guy, always quick to reply to any questions about shipping. Weed generally takes 2/3 days to arrive in the UK.<br /><br />
