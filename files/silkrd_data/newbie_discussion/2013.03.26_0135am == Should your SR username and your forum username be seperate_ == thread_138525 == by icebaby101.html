				I mean potentially your writings on here could get you incriminated so would it be best to keep your shop and forum name seperate from one another just in the (small)likelihood it could get traced back to you? can you make multiples accounts on the shop or are you just allowed one?

				I&#039;m not exactly sure. A long time ago I read a thread about how your SR name and forum name should be different for security, so I made my forum username different. Now I want to access the vendors only forum, but one of the requirements is my forum name match my vendor name and somebody already registered my forum name.

				It&#039;s totally up to you. Smarties is my allias user name. I have another forum user name which matches my real account name on the Road. I only use that one for writing reviews of sellers products - so they know it&#039;s me.<br /><br />Think about it any vendor you&#039;ve ever used obviously knows your full name and address so I prefer to use an allias 90% of the time just to retain that added bit of anonymity. <br /><br />Not that I have any evidence of this actually occurring but say you write an awful review of a vendors product or you have a major disagreement with one on here what&#039;s to stop a really shady vendor grassing you up to the police for drug possession? Double standards yes and also an extreme case it were to happen BUT you can never rule it out and you can hardly retaliate because you don&#039;t know where they live like they do you.<br /><br />You can have as many accounts as you want both here and on the Road. I&#039;ve been thinking about using a second Road account for my overseas orders. Basically due to international orders having a higher chance of being stopped by customs I would rather have a separate account for that so it doesn&#039;t effect my stats when making domestic orders.<br /><br />The fact that you get allocated a new IP address every time you log onto Tor would mean that your two accounts on the Road would never be able to be linked together anyway.

				Depends on how honest you want your comments to be i guess, and whether or not you are prepared to stand by them. Legally, anything said here on the forum, could at best, be construed as hearsay, however want kudos from fellow members, then declare yourself!<br /><br />If you just want to complain about poor quality, underweight orders, etc you might find some vendors less interested in undertaking and future business with you. Most vendors here want to earn, and keep a good rep. That&#039;s how business operates. We all know there are scammers on both sides of this fence. <br /><br />Most of us have lost a few btc along the way too, but taking good vendors and dragging their names through the mud, without so much as identifying one&#039;s self or allowing the vendor right or reply just isn&#039;t what places like this are about. <br /><br />emgee101<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;d always give my product reviews with under my real user name and have no problems stating both the pros and cons of the order under real user name. It&#039;s when you get into the more heavier criticisms like people making comments on vendors being potential scammers etc that you should be careful. Either way real user name or allias anything I said would still be my true thoughts and opinions and not just a load of BS because I thought I could get away with it since nobody would know who I was.

				I think Smarties is discussing the relevant angles here.&nbsp; I thought hard about it, but decided that vendors often use the same name, so it can&#039;t be that much riskier.&nbsp; I decided that the benefits of having relationships with repeat vendors warranted using the same name on the forums.&nbsp; But again, Smarties raises good points re: having two forum names for different types of posts.

				Out of pure online habit I used a different name. It only occurred to me after the fact that I probably locked myself out of freebies for helpful reviews (when I get to 50 and I&#039;m able to post them) but I digress I don&#039;t really &quot;need&quot; freebies. I want to write reviews because I think thorough feedback is hugely beneficial to everyone.
