				Simply put, it is real cocaine.<br /><br />I have never done high quality cocaine prior to using sr, and well....I am glad I know what real cola is. <br /><br />I mean, it doesn&#039;t have any overwhelming smell of gas/etc.....just a nice soft smell that goes up your nose effortlessly. Seriously, it&#039;s so smooth that you can just keep doing it......that is, if it wasn&#039;t for the incredibly potent cola that you&#039;re putting up there, HA! <br /><br />This stuff is soooo potent I have to watch myself; little bumps and small lines get you so high, so fast. The euphoric feeling is magnificent, pure cola. Slight numbing instantly followed by some build up a couple minutes later. Gummys offer a nice lip numb as well. The comedown is beautiful too, real easy....no bullshit, honestly.<br /><br />If you like coke, or just want to try real cola, Studio54 is the MAN. 100% dead serious. Stuff is incredibly legit. Probably the purest drug of any kind I&#039;ve gotten here. Simply amazing.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the communication/delivery/shipping/stealth is all top notch and it what you would expect from a professional vendor that cares about their product and their customers.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />turtle11

				Studio54 - what&#039;s to say about this fine vendors product that hasn&#039;t already been said?&nbsp; that, my SR friends is the question....Let me first start out by stating that any seasoned cola user, try as you will, you will NEVER, recapture that feeling you got, the very first time you did blow.&nbsp; I think most would agree with that statement?&nbsp; It&#039;s chasing the proverbial rainbow...the only difference now is, the pursuit of the treasure is most of the fun, as the treasure rarely satisfies....I&#039;ve been on a pursuit on the road since February.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some very good experience (props to Nod, Bungee, ItalianMafiaBrussels &amp; Kirby)....I&#039;ve also has some very painful experiences, both physical and financial....all this said, this dude named Studio54, is hands down, one of the finest vendors I&#039;ve had the pleasure of dealing, and has returned me back to the glory days! <br /><br />For starters, his communication is top notch, personable, and leaves you with the feeling that you&#039;re the only one that matters.&nbsp; He was kind enough to post a private sale for me last week, which I kindly obliged and sent my coins on their way.&nbsp; Product shipped from (?) somewhere in the US, and arrived in the Midwest Monday.&nbsp; Awesome!!!<br /><br />The Stealth - sparing the details, brilliant! <br /><br />Now onto the product -&nbsp; I rushed home this pas Monday on my lunch hour at the oft chance it would actually be there....sure enough, there it was.&nbsp; Left Friday, arrived Monday... Went inside, unpackaged it, breathed in that famously pure aroma, and knew right then and there, I&#039;d struck gold....believe it or not, I refrained from touching it for 24 hrs....did two matchstick sized lines tuesday evening, one per nostril, as I&#039;m an equal opportunity cola enthusiast, sat back, kicked some Umphrey&#039;s McGee....slow and subdued numbing ensued......sipped on my Johnnie Black rocks and 10 minutes later or so, let myself get taken away in pure euphoric bliss!!!&nbsp; I can&#039;t say enough about this product that hasn&#039;t already been spoken.&nbsp; It&#039;s lights out, some of the finest blow I&#039;ve ever done.&nbsp; I&#039;m no neophyte, as I financed a large portion of my undergraduate degree in the late 80&#039;s selling gear like this.&nbsp; I traveled back to those days.&nbsp; No urge to fiend....I probably did another 6 lines over the course of the evening, all quite small.&nbsp; inch long, thin rails, and I was fucking perfect.&nbsp; Went to bed around 11:00 pm, jumped out of bed around 6:30 ready to start my day.&nbsp; Zero NOSE issues, felt superb.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s all I got peeps!&nbsp; Trust this dude....he&#039;s the real deal!<br /><br />Mojo<br />

				Hmmm... This is all only wild speculation, but... maybe the bungee team tried the PDS and were thus INSPIRED! Therefrom, they became know as &#039;Bungee54&#039;.

				Here&#039;s my take PDS and Studio54. Simply the best I have ever experienced. I was able to jump onboard and received a nice reward today. I have been hanging around the Silk Road for awhile now. I&#039;m very careful about where I do business. I read on the forums but never felt compelled to participate until now. After paying attention on the forum I became interested in Studio54 and PDS. I am sure glad I did. Let me get to the bottom line here. What an amazing product. The smell is so nice and natural. It seems the effects are unadulterated and the way nature intended. I can verify this a I type! I received a nice big 3g rock and a couple smaller rocks. It was packed in a way that it could not be damaged and broken up. The packaging is amazing. Without going into detail I will say that a lot off attention and effort was put in to make me feel very safe. All the bells and whistles folks and I&#039;ve seen some good ones. His communication and professionalism was A1 all the way through. He even let&#039;s you know expected arrival date. Is that awesome or what? He just set the bar to it&#039;s highest position.

				Studio54 has the best coke SR has ever seen. My shipment was 10/10 all around for quickness and stealth. OMG the chunks were incredible. They were hard also but when crushed it was so smooth and tasted great. <br /><br />There&#039;s no way I&#039;d spend my money on a different coke vendor. FUCK THAT! If S54 is out then it&#039;s well worth the wait to get uncut Pure Disco Shit. Man this stuff is so good that the first line will send you into the Disco world where time has no meaning and the party is on!<br /><br />That&#039;s why I&#039;m taking pictures and checking weight before I do anything else with my next order that is coming any day now. I got several opinions from friends and neighbors calling it the best coke they ever done

				Ordering from Studio54 was one of the greatest decisions and it made me genuinely happy that I was able to support such a trustworthy vendor. While my order was around 6 weeks ago, I&#039;m back from vacation and able to write this review! Sorry for taking so long, but better late than never! <br /><br />I had a bunch of coke leftover and recently decided to splurge a bit with Studio54&#039;s Pure Disco Shit. At the beginning of last weekend, there was about 2 grams left and at the time of writing this review, I only have around .45g left :( <br /><br />Let&#039;s talk shipping first. IT IS STEALTH AT ITS FINEST! I&#039;ve never before said this with any other purchase but if anyone did indeed open up the box, there would be no further questions. The stealth totally matches its faux alias, and there really is no need to say more. Rest assured that the only way for the PDS to not reach you is if you provide a faulty address. Studio54 was also kind enough to tell me when to expect it (3 mailing days from being marked in transit) AND followed up with a confirmation message a few days later saying that it was marked as out for delivery so I should expect it. WOW! How many vendors do you know that keeps track of your order for you?? Which leads me to my next point...<br /><br />Studio54&#039;s communication is unprecedented in this community. He&#039;s a great guy to talk to, even out of context. The words from his own mouth: &quot;i treat everyone like you were a friend and we make trades between us, and not &quot;deals&quot; ya know?&quot; Seemingly insignificant details like this totally change the whole concept of buying drugs. THIS is what you should feel like when purchasing from someone; there&#039;s no need to feel &quot;dirty&quot; like society wants you to feel like when buying drugs. The entire image and stigma around drugs is finally being lifted, and S54 is leading the way with his professionalism. No longer are drugs associated with sketchy alley dealers but rather with mom and pop shops that we have here. He&#039;s coming to us with arms wide open and treating us how he would like to be treated. It&#039;s only proper and fair if we do the same. There&#039;s a reason why Studio54 has a reputation of having the best cocaine on the Road, and his customer service definitely plays a part in it.<br /><br />Best on the Road? Without a doubt. This Coca-Cola... WOW. It makes you feel so good!!! The burst of energy and confidence you get after doing a .1g line is unprecedented with anything you&#039;d find in this world! Hell, you don&#039;t even need that much, .05-.07 is enough! Doing that every so often changed my entire perception of the drug. I look forward to indulging myself in the treat I have set aside for myself and others. That ball I bought has lasted over a month, and I haven&#039;t been the only one insufflating this &quot;hard stuff.&quot; Unfortunately, it was a little short, weighed out to 3.35 grams (with bag 3.72, bag itself weighed .37g) but that&#039;s no problem because all 3.35 were flakes, scales, rocks, whatever you want to call it and hardly any actual powder. It&#039;s cola that&#039;s sure to visually impress any connoisseur, guaranteed. <br /><br />Cutting out lines takes a while, building up the anticipation of it flowing through the rolled bill up and into your nostrils only to be trapped by the mucous membrane and slowly absorbed into the body. Of course it&#039;s going to be a process to cut it up considering it&#039;s all flakes and rocks!! I love doing it, shit typing this up is tempting me to measure out a line right now but I&#039;ve got it waiting for me later tonight :) <br /><br />As soon as those particles hit your nose, though, holy FUUUUUUUUCK. My eyes see the light! I snort and the power of the coke immediately rocks my head back as I sniffle away. This shit has got my girlfriend loving the feeling of soaring off to heaven, and at first she never felt any effect with cocaine from previous vendors. There&#039;s no speediness, but rather alertness and openness. I&#039;ve introduced this cocaine to people who still retained their virginity. Kind of evil, yes, since they probably won&#039;t ever have the same type of quality again, but it&#039;s a hell of a first time, right? some friends who are coke junkies to put it blunty have stated that it is the best blow they have ever done, ever. I&#039;m not BS&#039;ing any of you, it really is the cleanest, purest shit, and that&#039;s what makes it so good: the clean. You don&#039;t feel like shit at all. The comedown is a bit questionable, sure, but the anxiousness and stuff are tolerable. One bump will have me personally lasting a good two hours if I want to milk it, but generally I&#039;d do a new line or bump an hour apart because that&#039;s the perfect interval. If you want to sleep, plan on doing it 3-4 hours beforehand. But damn, Studio, my girlfriend won&#039;t shutup because of you! She&#039;s such a chatterbox when she does a line, and you&#039;re the reason she likes coke now! She loves doing it and always has a good time!<br /><br />Please, I have one giant rock with change, so reup soon so I can go buy more! About to make that .45g .3 tonight with three nice lines!! I can&#039;t fucking wait.<br /><br />Keep doing what you&#039;re doing, Studio54, you&#039;re making many fine ladies and gentlemen joyous!<br /><br />PICTURES (clearnet!):<br />http://min.us/mq5Ej0xpfkJiy
