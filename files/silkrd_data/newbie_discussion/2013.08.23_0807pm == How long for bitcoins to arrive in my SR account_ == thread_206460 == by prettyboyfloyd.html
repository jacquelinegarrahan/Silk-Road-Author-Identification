				Have my funds disappeared between leaving my btc vendor site and arriving on my SR account? Or should I expect a time lag before they appear? <br /><br />The funds were successfully transferred out but my SR account&#039;s showing zero. Please tell me they haven&#039;t disappeared! afaik I&#039;m definitely not using a phishing site but this is absolutely my first time. <br /><br />e2a I&#039;m definitely using the correct address, copied/pasted the SR wallet address as the destination. Help!<br /><br />&nbsp;:o they&#039;ve just arrived - panic over. Now I know&nbsp; :)

				You need to wait for the bitcoin network to confirm the transaction, so it&#039;s perfectly normal if your bitcoin seems to have &quot;disappeared&quot;.<br />Once the transaction has been confirmed, you will see the bitcoins on your SR account. Shouldn&#039;t take more than a few minutes.<br />Edit : Damn, didn&#039;t read the end of your post. That&#039;ll teach me :/

				Thanks for the info anyway Sunsha - sure was a relief. <br /><br />Took around 40 mins to show though... luckily I&#039;m messing around with some opium tea this evening so just sort of drifted along with the freakout until it all came good. I used to love looking out for the posty on his rounds, like a lover&nbsp; :-[. But budmonkey had nothing on this place!

				FancySwim(insert number here) is sure a persistent scammer. And yes there is always a lag. According to SR it can be up to six hours. I have never seen it be that long but it has been upwards of 2 and a half for me a few times. <br />
