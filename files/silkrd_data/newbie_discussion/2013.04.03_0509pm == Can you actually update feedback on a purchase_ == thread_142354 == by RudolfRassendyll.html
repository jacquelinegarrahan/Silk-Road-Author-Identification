				So a couple weeks ago I bought something and was scammed, the old FE nonsense. The seller was Nice Dreams by the way, and you should never ever buy from him.<br /><br />What I would like to know is I always see people leave feedback that says &quot;FE will update&quot; and is there really a way to update? Because dude stole my money and he got a 5/5 from me with no blasting his evil stealing ways. If he has my 60 bucks I at least want to change my feedback to the lowest and warn people not to use him on his main feedback page.<br /><br />I already made a thread here about it to warn people, but from his feedback people are still buying from him and still FEing. I don&#039;t know what more I can do but I feel every minute his page is up is an affront. I&#039;ve reported him but no action has been taken yet. He hasn&#039;t responded in any way to offer a resolution to not sending me my order, clearly he just took my money and never sent the product. So really if there&#039;s anything else I can do to help shut this guy down I will so go out of my way to do it.

				Yes.&nbsp; Go to your account page and on the right side there is an option to view feedback, that&#039;s where you can edit!

				First, sorry you got scammed.&nbsp; <br /><br />and second, YES, you can change the feedback. Just click on account - view feedback and there you can find all your previous feedback given and are able to change it.<br /><br />One Love<br /><br />(someone was faster)

				yeah click on your &quot;account&quot; button, then you will see a menu on the right that says account links, and you can click &quot;view feedback&quot; and then you can edit your feedback. I don&#039;t know if people can&#039;t figure that out or they just get too high to care about going back and updating. either way, good luck. i don&#039;t know what happened really, you weren&#039;t too specific, but you are definitely entitled to modify your feedback based on your experience

				What a nice cathartic release. It was really bugging me that he had good feedback from me. Now it&#039;s 1/5 with a nice warning.<br /><br />What happened was I ordered opiate withdrawal medicine from him two weeks before I needed it. I have used SR tons in the past but I had been gone for about 6 months and lost my login info so I had to make a new name. My previous name was Raskal420 and I had maybe 15-20 transactions.<br /><br />I always had a theory in my mind that the suboxone (withdrawal medicine) vendors on SR were infallable because... well, you&#039;d have to be an evil bastard to scam someone for WD medicine. I have spent tons of money on suboxone here... I&#039;ve kept myself maintained on a low dose for almost a year. So when Nice Dreams asked me to FE I figured it would go smoothly. Within a few days I realized that was not the case as he began to get bad feedback from other people for not shipping his orders, and so I messaged him. I was very frank in the message and basically said &quot;If you scammed me please just tell me so I can order from another vendor and not be in withdrawal&quot;. He read the messages and did not respond, in another few days I figured all was lost and ordered from other vendors, but it wasn&#039;t fast enough to save me and I spent about three days in acute withdrawal, which is incredibly unpleasant and really was a SO FUCKING LOW thing to do to someone.<br /><br />To this day he has not responded to me except to express outrage when I sent him a message telling him I reported him. Even then he didn&#039;t claim he sent me anything or offer me a refund, it was literally just &quot;I haven&#039;t been able to log on in a while, why did you report me!&quot; without addressing the four other messages asking what was going on.<br /><br />So yeah moral of the story is someone is always there to try and scam you no matter what it means to you if you don&#039;t get the product, never finalize early no matter what (this really can&#039;t be said enough even though it&#039;s said all the time), and fuck that Nice Dreams asshole. Seriously, I&#039;d pay btc to anyone who could do bad things to this guy.
