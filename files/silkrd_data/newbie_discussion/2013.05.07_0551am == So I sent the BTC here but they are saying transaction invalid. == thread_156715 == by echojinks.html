				I know I used the right address and everything. Also after trying to refresh my client(Multi Bit) it doesn&#039;t show that I sent anything at all even though my coins are gone.<br /><br />Anyone have similar issues and/or solution?

				That&#039;s strange.&nbsp; Does the transaction show up on blockchain.info if you enter your receiving btc address in the search field?

				That is where it says it is invalid/non-existent. Like I made sure to get the address right and even had a decent fee so it would go through faster. It was saying before it disappeared that it had been seen by 1 peer and not in a block yet but that was almost 24 hours ago.<br /><br />Sorry I know I should have been asking questions here before starting but I didn&#039;t.<br /><br />The real question I have is does it seem like I lost the coins or maybe they are just acting really fucking crazy?

				Hmmm ... I know SR is experiencing delays in btc deposits, but from your posts it sounds like this is an issue on the multibit end of things, rather than the SR end of things.&nbsp; If it were showing up on blockchain, it&#039;d be an issue with SR.&nbsp; Since it&#039;s not even showing up on blockchain, my guess is that it is an issue with your bitcoin client.

				Get in touch with multibit support!&nbsp; You&#039;re saying you have a multibit wallet with funds, tried to send those funds, and received an error and your transaction doesn&#039;t show on blockchain, correct?&nbsp; You&#039;d need to get in touch with Multibit people since it is their software.

To solve it just open up MultiBit, click on &#039;Tools&#039;, then &#039;Reset Blockchain and Transactions&#039;. This will re-sync everything and your transfer will be sent. It won&#039;t erase your wallet or anything so don&#039;t worry about that! :)<br /><br />I would highly recommend exporting your private keys to a secure file first though just in case anything goes wrong - at least then you&#039;ll have a backup and can import them back into MultiBit if needs be.<br /><br />Your Bitcoin haven&#039;t actually left your wallet yet, the client just thinks they have but hasn&#039;t sent them out. You can export your keys from the same &#039;Tools&#039; menu by clicking &#039;Export Private Keys&#039;.<br /><br />Let us know how you get on. :)<br /><br />Libertas

				Thank you Lib. So how do I prevent it from happening again since you seem to know about Multi Bit?<br /><br />I hope my coins aren&#039;t stuck in my computer forever.

Unfortunately I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a way to stop it from happening again, but in all the time I&#039;ve been using MultiBit (4 separate clients on 4 separate computers) it has only occurred once. If it ever does repeat you can just reset the blockchain and transactions again and you&#039;ll be good to go. :)<br /><br />They&#039;re not stuck in your computer forever, you&#039;ll get &#039;em out of there. ;)<br /><br />Libertas
