				Assuming you have bought bitcoins, they will be in a wallet on a different website. you will need to navigate to their withdraw funds page once there you will need to enter the address of your sr wallet (click on account, it&#039;s a long combination of letters and numbers) and the amount you want to transfer.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t bought bitcoins yet, the easiest and/or most discrete method varies by country, but their are many guides out there and I will be happy to show you the right one if you tell me your country.

				Where do you have the bitcoins now?&nbsp; In an online wallet or haven&#039;t you gotten them yet?&nbsp; If they are in an online wallet, you just use the send function in the wallet and send to the address that&#039;s on your account page on SR.

It was a bit of a headache for me at the start too, but it&#039;s actually quite easy after you do it once. <br />1) Go to Bitstamp.net and set up an account, it&#039;s very easy. Then on your account go to deposit, select an amount to deposit... say&nbsp; €200. Once you do this the website will give you details on how to deposit the €200 into your Bitstamp account via a bank transfer on your internet banking. <br />2) Log into your internet banking and select an international bank transfer. You will have all the details such as receiver name, swift code and IBAN codes from the Bitstamp deposit page. Make the transfer, usually takes 1business day. <br />3) Log into your Bitstamp account the next day to see that your funds have arrived.<br />4) Once they have, select the buy bitcoins option on Bitstamp. Buy all the coins you can afford at the going rate.They will be attributed to your Bitstamp account so at €50 a coin, you will have 4 bitcoins.<br />5) Log into your Silk Road account and you click the account option (beside messages and orders). There you will find an address to deposit bitcoins into your Silk Road account. Copy this address.<br />6) Go back to Bitstamp.net and select the withdrawal option, it will ask you to provide a withdrawal address, paste the address from your Silk Road account.<br />7) Wait a few hours and bob&#039;s your uncle. Your Silk Road account should have 4 bitcoins in it.<br /><br /><br />Alternatively.... give me €50 and I&#039;ll do it all for you :) <br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />MacDknife

				Double check any exchange you&#039;re going to give money to, many are scams.<br /><br />I would try localbitcoins, it&#039;s the easiest way I&#039;ve managed to buy in the UK<br /><br />Hope all goes well for you
