				Hello,<br /><br />I am a retired banker who has been recruited by some top silk road vendors to provide bitcoins for silk road customers.<br /><br />As many of you know there have been quite a few closures of Bitcoin Exchanges.&nbsp; Many of the exchanges still open are requiring ID and are no longer anonymous for the buyers.&nbsp; You can be assured that BBB will be your go to Bitcoin vendor for fast, safe, and stress free transactions for Bitcoins!<br /><br />I have been a lurker on silk road for many months and have seen the many Bitcoin scams that are posted nearly everyday.&nbsp; I can assure you I am here to do business.<br /><br />The vendors I am working with will provide limited Bitcoins (50 - 100) on a daily basis.&nbsp; I will most likely sell out everyday, what that allows me to do is not to take to many orders, allowing me to provide excellent service to my customers everyday.<br /><br />My rates are posted on my main page.<br /><br /><br /><br />I will accept:&nbsp; Vanilla Moneypacks, Reloadit&#039;s, and cash in the mail.&nbsp; Greendot&#039;s will only be accepted on a VERY limited basis.<br /><br />

				Customers will buy a listing ....complete with SR feedback........did several transfers today....customers got their bitcoins in about 2 hours....once funds were verified.<br /><br />The vendors who recruited me have been providing bitcoins for the top bitcoin vendors on SR for many months......have seen lots of them come and go.....have seen lots of bad vendors who rip people off.....have seen it all with these fly by night vendors.........They decided months ago to find someone who is professional, who understand business, who understand customer service, and who understands money.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can do all of that every day for my customers......and that is the plan.....to be available daily for all your bitcoin needs........these vendors are in the top 5% of all vendors, and they need their customers to have quick access to bitcoins to make their SR purchases go smoothly.<br /><br />My experience was with trading currencies......I will do 2 transfers daily directly to customers SR account.......8am &amp; 6 pm pacific time.<br /><br />Of course there will be times, I can make transfers faster......but experience tells me.....to set transfer times.....and if transfers are made sooner.....better for the customer.<br /><br />Thanks

If all goes according to plan for me, expect to see me on your SR listing Friday. Also I noticed on your listing that it says you only accept a minimum of $300 BTC and you do not accept Green Dot MoneyPaks. I already bought the $100 MP. Will you be able to accept it?

				I just did a transaction with BlondeBitcoinBanker and my coins were in my account within an hour of first contacting him/her.<br /><br /><br />I bought a couple of hundred dollars in reloadits because another seller required them and then bailed because he &quot;didn&#039;t have enough coins&quot;.&nbsp; I was stuck with these things and had no idea how to use them. A search of the forums showed BlondeBitcoinBanker to have a good rep - long story short, he had the money in my account within an hour. Really helped me out.<br /><br />Fast, friendly, businesslike. He&#039;s my go-to guy now for bitcoin. I am a super satisfied customer.
