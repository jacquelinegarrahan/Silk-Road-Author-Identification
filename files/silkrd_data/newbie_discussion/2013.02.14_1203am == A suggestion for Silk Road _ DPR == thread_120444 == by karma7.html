				I wanted to show my elderly mom how to buy some Xanax on SR, but I don&#039;t want her to find out about my sordid habits.<br /><br />If there was an SR clone focusing solely on prescription pharmaceuticals, it may draw a whole new set of possible users: There are many tech-savvy seniors who would be shocked at the mention of cocaine, but would love to get some reasonably priced generic Xanax. <br /><br />This may result in growing bitcoin usage, post office shipments, etc etc which would indirectly benefit SR as well: It would also create a group of politically active voters who would resist possible legislation designed on putting the screws on TOR/BTC/SR, because that would mess with something they value. <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br />K7

				Hello good sir.<br /><br />While appreciate the point you are trying to make I would profess that enacting such a suggestion would be detrimental to SR. While SR can provide you with your needs it is also full of other goodies that most societies frown upon or even detest. The thing is that is sort of the point. SR is not simply a means of facilitating a market yearning to break free, it is a cornerstone of social change. It is a symbol of the best works from philosophical giants. It&#039;s objective efficiency is a testament to Mill&#039;s utilitarianism; it&#039;s basis on the Categorical Imperative of Autonomy upholds the foundation of Kant&#039;s Virtue Ethics; in acting with such freedom and being an example to which it wants all to aspire it expresses a meaning of existence Sartre would embrace; and finally the relativity of the morals upheld on the site, the masks upon masks, and the unflinching weight of the market paint a mustachioed silhouette of Nietzsche. In short, Silkroad is beautiful as is and I hope it keeps championing its message.<br /><br />As for a practical response to your issue:<br />Order the Xanax for her. You can even have her buy the bitcoins and send them to you. You can even run them through a washer at some point though SR&#039;s tumbler achieves a similar goal. The more trusted people in the transaction the more difficult it is to trace. Alternatively if she is really asking to get Xanax without a script then just take the chance and show her. It&#039;s tough for someone who would circumvent the law to judge others whom do the same for victimless crimes. Finally, you can risk some sketchy online pharmacies on clearnet. Ironically they are more likely to scam you than the vendors here.<br /><br />Feel free to message me any questions.<br />Cheers,<br />Smith.

Any steps we can take to make the concepts of bitcoin and anonymous marketplaces more palatable to a broader audience, would be very constructive overall. <br /><br />BTW I&#039;m not advocating removing these goods from SR. I&#039;m just saying create a new marketplace, and hide any ownership/administration overlap with SR. So I&#039;m not sure how this would be detrimental to SR.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />K7<br /><br /><br /><br />
