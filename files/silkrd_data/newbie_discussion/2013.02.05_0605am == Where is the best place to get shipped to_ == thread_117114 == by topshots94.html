				depends on the quantity though, is it just a small amount your own adress shouldnt be a problem.. Is it a little more you should probably do something smart, in big cities(not towns) but cities, they often got places you can get it shipped for later get it delivered or pick-it up, or something like that, could be something?.. <br />But i havent had that problem since i mostly buy small amounts, or friends buy for me..

				I&#039;m pretty sure SR does have some comprehensive guidelines or suggestions on how to ensure delivery, and avoid any worries, or at least minimize them. One of the suggestions is to have it sent to a friend you trust, I believe... so long as they don&#039;t make like it&#039;s Secret Santa time...

				Should have a reak of the SR WIki, stickied forum threads, and vendor pages to get a quick understanding of how to operate within then SR site.<br /><br />There are 3 main options you could use :<br /><br />1. Real Name and Address<br />2. PO Box ( with or without fake ID )<br />3. Using a shelf company<br /><br />Before making your first purchase you should really do a fair amount of research first just to get a girm idea of what you are doing.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw

				Most people just ship it to their own homes, but with a false name.<br />For added security, after the package arrives you can write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the from and leave it in the hall for a few days. So if you do get a visit, however unlikely, you have a plan in place.<br /><br />Tbh though, small amounts sent domestically are fine to your own address.<br />If you&#039;re order from international sellers, or you&#039;re ordering large amounts, it might be an idea to set up a &#039;drop&#039; - friend&#039;s house, other property, PO Box etc..&nbsp; just depends how far you wanna take it.

The postman/postal service have no clue who lives in my house. For all they know, it could be the Easter bunny.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why people think this is such an issue.
