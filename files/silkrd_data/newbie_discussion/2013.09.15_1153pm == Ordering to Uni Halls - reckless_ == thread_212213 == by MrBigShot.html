				Been floating around for a while and finally settled on a product &amp; vendor I want to buy from (Nintendo Allstars from Technohippy (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/031a27a119)).<br />However I&#039;ve hit a snag in terms of delivery. The reviews he has suggest his stealth is fantastic, on par with the best it would seem which is why I chose him, so I&#039;m not concerned about Royal Mail/whoever picking up on it.<br />But I currently live at home with my mum and will be moving to University Halls within the next few weeks and am fairly sure of waiting until then.<br /><br />Has anyone ordered from SR to University halls before? Would I be alright to order to my halls, should I order to a friend who lives out-of-halls, am I over-worrying, etc...<br /><br /><br />Any advice from people who have similar stories or have dealt with Technohippy before would be really appreciated, I don&#039;t want to order to home unless I absolutely have to as I can&#039;t be sure if my mum will be suspicious.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Big

				There&#039;s a good chance you&#039;d be fine ordering to the halls, but personally I would find a friend who lived off campus and throw them a little something to order to their place.

				Chances are, someone who lived in your flat in the past will still be getting (junk) mail sent there, I&#039;d just use their name.<br /><br />People recommend not to do this on the basis that the postman will know that person doesn&#039;t live at that particular address and will get suspicious, but that&#039;s definitely not going to be the case for halls.

				The answer of snark sounds good to me.<br />Tiger&#039;s one sounds logical, too.<br />Myself would ask a trustworthy person to order to their place.

				I&#039;m sure students at what I call a dorm get mail all the time. I know I did when I was in college, as did many people on my floor. Why would anyone be suspicious about your letter or small parcel?
