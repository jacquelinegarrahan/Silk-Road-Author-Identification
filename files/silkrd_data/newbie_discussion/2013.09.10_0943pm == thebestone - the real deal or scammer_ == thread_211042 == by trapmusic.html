				Hi guys,<br />the vendor thebestone has the best prices for coke and pills compared to anybody on SR but his prices are so ridiculously cheap and he demands FE that im a little worried that he might start a scam here. Do you believe it or would you trust him?<br />this is his vendor page<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/eeaf1821aa/<br />Thank you

				They dont request FE for everyone. If your a noob and from australia, then you are either going to be selectively scammed, or asked to FE...by any vendor.<br /><br />Friend of mine recently ordered from them, and no FE.
