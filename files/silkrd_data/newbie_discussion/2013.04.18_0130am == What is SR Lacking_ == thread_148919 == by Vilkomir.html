				Ladies and Gents,<br /><br />Welcome and hello! I have been lurking on SR for a good long time (under a few handles) doing some market research, considering getting involved in a vendor roll. <br /><br />I wanted to ask all of you, and every one of if you could sum up in one sentence something you wish you could get on SR but can&#039;t what would it be? (Of course following DPRs select rules.)<br /><br />Signed,<br />My current Russian Handle.

				Hi,<br /><br />Well I know you mean products, but i&#039;m going to mention something else...<br /><br />I think the actual SR interface could use more features such as serach products by price, weight, more location perameters etc.<br /><br />In terms of product, why not offer tangible products such as mobile phones, digital radios etc.

				Thanks Kneotac for the response,<br /><br />I do agree with you that some functionality of SR is still a little infantile... I plan on setting up a hidden service this weekend to see what kind of complexities it ensues... I imagine new features and client side rendering are really to slow to be effective, I have a lot of experience in hosting on the clearnet. Hope to apply that and help people here.<br /><br />As for your product recommendation, I was thinking about that... I am thinking there may be use cases on SR for legal things that perhaps... Anonymity is easier/preferred, or you come for the drugs and stay for legal products?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The more the media reports on Tor/SR the more people will come... And I know many, myself included, just like the idea of surfing (Clear or Darknet) with out google/apple/*Insert ISP here* knowing everything I do and building me into a profile.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Some Ukranian Duke

				@Murder4Fun, thanks for the reply... Bombs and IEDs did intrigue me, but from my reading they are not permitted by DPRs standards, and I know Cheese Pizza is certainly not. I understand that the many layers of the onion may be lawless, but to have success... I can&#039;t be!<br /><br />@Joker&nbsp; I am from NA and have limited experience in Heroin markets, and not sure if my contacts would remain priced/friendly if my qtys upped enough for global sell, I think I would have to delve deeper. As for your comments on MaryJane, I completely agree and it is a target I am eyeing. Even just Seed distribution seems completely over favored to the seller... Let&#039;s let capitalism roam free and see if I can make a buck?<br /><br />Much Appreciate input from you both!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Some Iranian Dude (Who just admitted he is from NA ahhh!

				CR thank you for the well thought out response,<br /><br />IDs ~ Thank-You, I saw some and assumed they were good quality.

				Mike,<br /><br />I hear you! I agree as well! But how can we market this? And how can I make money doing so?
