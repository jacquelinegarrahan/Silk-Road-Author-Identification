				Hence the screen name. I have run across such kind and honest vendors and feel yesterday I may have encountered my first scam. Unfortunately it was a MP for BTC scam and I can&#039;t but help feel saddened. Anyways that is my rant for the day&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Who was the vendor??? This happened to me as well a few days ago with a vendor I thought was reputable.. I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s the same vendor. PM me his name if you don&#039;t want to tarnish his rep.. (yet). <br /><br />Also, what was the story behind it? What did he tell you?

				Thanks mate. I know we deal with things that aren&#039;t quite socially accepted all over, but it doesn&#039;t mean someone can&#039;t be an honest and upright individual and still do these things. I have met so many honest and kind vendors on SR and after getting taken for the first time..ugh

				That sucks, dude. It&#039;s always always good to do research on the forums when doing these kinds of deals. Like you, I learned this the hard way getting scammed about a month ago.
