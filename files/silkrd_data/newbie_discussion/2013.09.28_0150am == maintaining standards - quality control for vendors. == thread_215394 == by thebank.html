				Hi So i was wondering what people thought about vendors maintaining standards after testing?<br />I bought some coke off a top vendor as my first purchase off the road and it was mind blowing -&nbsp; but re ordered the same product a couple of weeks later and it was very weak. I messaged the vendor who initially side stepped my gentle inquiry about quality - then received a second message from the vendor saying that they had had another customer complaint of a similar nature and that they would re check with their supplier.<br /><br />so anyway i guess i realised that if a vendor thinks your a chump or low stats etc they can pretty much sell you any old weak shit if they have a great rep. If their ratings are high they dont have to maintain their standards. and once they get a test saying its 90 percent they can dam well do what they want.<br /><br />Incidentally the feedback for said vendor is very very high and they are considered one of the best. I didnt really want to leave bad feedback either and risk a fall out. -&nbsp; i want the good stuff they sold me first time round. i realise that everyone probably feels abit nervous to leave bad feedback too -&nbsp; cos they want the goods -&nbsp; or maybe this is just me.<br /><br />how do people deal with this kinda situation? i&#039;m in it for the high quality goods otherwise i may as well just go back to my neighborhood provider.

				I was with you right up until I got here:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I messaged the vendor who initially side stepped my gentle inquiry about quality - then received a second message from the vendor saying that they had had another customer complaint of a similar nature and that they would re check with their supplier.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK. First, I doubt that he&#039;s testing every batch. But even if he were, it&#039;s possible that he stepped on it and just got a little to carried away. No coke is 100% pure. Anyone telling you that is full of shit. Same is try for any manufactured street drug. There&#039;s a cut at every level.<br /><br />With that said, look at it from his perspective. It&#039;s possible he didn&#039;t know how bad it was stepped on (he may not be into coke). Also, there are so many asshole buyers (I&#039;m a buyer; I&#039;ve never been a vendor so this isn&#039;t a vendor rant) who try to scam vendors claiming their bags don&#039;t make weight or aren&#039;t good enough quality wise. I&#039;d be skeptical if only one person complained; he admitted to you that he had another complaint (he probably waited for that before getting back to you) and said he&#039;d look into it.<br /><br />No here&#039;s how you handle it. You make it clear that you&#039;re unhappy, ask very nicely if there&#039;s anything he can do for you because you&#039;d like to maintain a business relationship with him. If he refuses, you never buy from him again and you come here and write a bad review. Most of the vendors here are shrewd business people (some are Grade A morons, but they are the exception to the rule).<br /><br />It&#039;s sounds like what you got had some amount of cocaine in it (I had an 8 ball a day habit when I was in high school, so I know quite a bit about coke). It was just shit quality. Use it as a learning experience and move on. You can&#039;t use illegal drugs without getting burnt from time to time.<br /><br />Sorry it happened to you, but accept it, move on, and learn from it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">so anyway i guess i realised that if a vendor thinks your a chump or low stats etc they can pretty much sell you any old weak shit if they have a great reputation</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Report him if you believe he scammed you. You can get away with that once or twice, but if everyone writes a negative review, gives low feedback, and reports them, then they are history. That&#039;s the power that buyers have collectively.<br /><br />Finally, for any drug like coke, you shouldn&#039;t be finalizing before you sample it. It&#039;s easier to get a vendor to work to make things right BEFORE YOU FINALIZE. I never finalize for Adderall until I can feel the effects (I&#039;m not the reagent type -- I&#039;m a great chemist, but too fucking lazy for that LOL).<br /><br />Good luck to you in the future! Bon soir mon frere!

				hey thanks for your advice and reply.<br /><br />i guess i got suspicious cos said vendor was intially listing two grades of product. they stopped selling their lower grade and then hey presto after this i purchase something listed as higher that was quite weak. i figure they sold the lower as the higher and the vendor thought i wouldnt be able to tell.<br /><br />its a little hard with coke cos i find it a pretty subtle drug in a lot of ways, however i ve done enough to know what a good product is and find my nose pretty reliable.<br /><br />am now thinking i will get one of those ez test kits&nbsp; -&nbsp; cos i just really want a realiable vendor that has a great product and that i can use as a regular -&nbsp; think most buyers just want this really. dependability and respect are so important for me.<br /><br />i guess if i order some stuff again off them , and no doubt i will -&nbsp; and if its still weak i&#039;ll leave a negative -&nbsp; will be the first one to do so on the vendors page. I kind of really dont want to do this but i guess i need to flag it up for other buyers.<br /><br />actually&nbsp; -&nbsp; can i ask something else -&nbsp; do the vendors have a black list for buyers? i dont want to be stuck on some stupid black list for simply posting a bit on negative feedback? this kind of freaks me out a bit.<br /><br />also wanted to add -&nbsp; can totally see your point about scammer buyers too. vendors also need to protect themselves from people trying to blackmail them with neg feedback etc etc&nbsp; ----&nbsp; i think its a pretty fragile relationship all round. <br /><br />solidarity to you my brother and thanks for the answer.

There used to be a long thread in the rumor mill section (it&#039;s probably still there). There&#039;s also probably one in the vendor forum.<br /><br /><br />There are both scam buyer and scam vendor threads in the forums.

				Yeah this really is the root of alot of problems with any source of illegal drugs... testing is great but every batch is gonna be different. There&#039;s huge incentives on the vendor side to provide a great quality product only when you know it&#039;ll be tested, or to have different qualities on hand to use depending on the type of buyer, to cut the fuck out of your product, and so on. Unscrupulous vendors do even better here where they can be anonymous and the worst thing they have to fear from a disgruntled buyer is a strongly worded review...<br /><br />Some folks have started &quot;Avenger&quot; threads trying to deal with this problem for other drugs like MDMA, LSD, etc. It&#039;s tough work, made all the more difficult since there is no easy way to determine quality. Consumer-level mass spectrometers... when will we see such a thing?? :) Why can&#039;t my smart phone become a tricorder that can analyze anything? Better yet just give me a fucking replicator! ;)
