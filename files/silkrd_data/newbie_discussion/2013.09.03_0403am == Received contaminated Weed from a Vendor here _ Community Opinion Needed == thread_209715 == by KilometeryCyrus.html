				i recently received a smallish order from one of the top EU weed vendors.<br />upon closer inspection of the buds, i noticed unusual green particles on their outside.<br />when i checked them with a microscope i could verify that they are considerably bigger than the trichromes and have another color [transparent greenish]. <br />when i asked the vendor about what these particles could be, i was answered &#039;the product ist clean. i dont smoke shit&#039; without any further explanation.<br />when i carefully asked for more information i was told by the vendor in all-caps that i am insulting her and her grower and i should not ever msg her again without a &#039;Lab-result&#039;.<br />then i told the vendor that i just want some clarification and repeated that i dont have bad intentions.<br />the next answer from the vendor was that she put me on the &#039;top vendor refuse list&#039;.<br /><br />what do you think? should i just give the vendor 1/5 and forget about the matter? i guess i should contact support about me being put on a refuse list?!<br /><br />any input would be appreciated

				Gross man, if its really bad I say review it appropriately. If you want give the vendor a chance to try and make it up, but if you don&#039;t want and/or the vendor is being a chump - you should really let everyone know &quot;this vendor is selling shit weed with weird chemicals on it&quot;<br /><br />TAF always delivers :)<br /><br />No international though, sorry :(

				microscope pictures? (if you don&#039;t have a microscope camera, you can always take a smartphone/etc and put it up to the lens. you&#039;d be suprised the quality you can get via this method) it could always be&nbsp; &quot;caviar&quot;, the only kind of acceptable lacing... lacing with concentrate lolz
