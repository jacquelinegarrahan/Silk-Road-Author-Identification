				Hi<br /><br />I came on here and went straight to the newbies section.<br />I&#039;ve made a few f*ck up&#039;s already and have some questions please.<br /><br />1) I am reading the &#039;Complete all in one guide on&nbsp; how to anonymously use SR at the moment, and it mentions setting up a live USB. I do have a USB but I have already installed my tor browser, and am surfing using my laptop.<br />Do I just re-install tor on my USB?<br /><br />2) In other threads I mentioned that I had mistakenly gone onto google in my tor browser and had to complete a capatcha. I was advised on here to use a new identity. If I change identity, does that mean that I will have to re-join on here as a new member?<br /><br />Sorry. totally lost and a bit worried i have unmasked myself, but can&#039;t wait to become familiar with stuff.<br /><br />Many thanks

				First of all, no, if you change identity on the tor browser, you will not have to make a new user. Changing your identity in tor, means that you will get &#039;fresh circuits&#039;. Inside tor, when you ask to see a webpage, the request is sent to someone else, who sends it to someone else, who sends it to someone else etc. until it eventually hits what is called an exit-node, who then goes on the internet, finds the webpage you&#039;re requesting, and sends it back to you. All these &#039;nodes&#039; are your circuit. When you change identity, you get a new circuit with different nodes (and if you get a new exit node, it appears you have a different IP from before). The user you have on the forums and on SR are not &#039;locked&#039; to any specific IP, so you can still use it.<br /><br /><br />With regards to you USB, it is not required, but highly suggested that you use either Tails or Liberté Linux as your operating system or OS, and not just run the TOR browser bundle on Windows (which is probably what you&#039;re doing now). To sum up: you should not install the TOR browser bundle on your USB, but instead install either Tails or Liberté Linux. Both of these operating systems contain TOR.

				Hi<br /><br />Thanks for your help. I will change my ID now. Thanks for explaining that.<br /><br />I&#039;m a little confused about the USB thing, though, but that&#039;s just me.<br />Is Liberte linux for linux OS&#039;s,?<br />If so, how do I install it on a windows USB stick?<br />Also, why do we need to set up a live USB? Is that for purchases we may want to make?<br /><br />Thanks again and sorry for the questions.<br />

				A &quot;live USB&quot; is a way to install an entirely new operating system on the USB device. It is used to maximize security. Using a &quot;live USB&quot;, your native operating system like Windows does not participate in the activity silk road at all. Everything happens on the &quot;live USB&quot; key, which must be stored safely. Small safes can be purchased against cash at many big box retailers and are a good investment, because in many situations, the existence and even content safes must be explicitly named in a warrant to a police officer is authorized to search. When your &quot;live USB&quot; not in use, keep it in the safe.

				colorsound, <br />Liberte is a Linux distro that you can install on your USB drive.&nbsp; Then you&#039;ll boot from that USB drive rather than your computer&#039;s hard disk.&nbsp; you will probably need to go into the BIOS and specify your USB drive as first priority in the boot order.&nbsp; I think that guide you mentioned gives pretty good directions on how to go about this.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, it even explains how to install Liberte on the USB.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.

				Hi and thanks<br /><br />Sorry but I have more questions.<br /><br />Even though I have got tor browser bundle on my windows laptop, can I re-install liberte on my USB stick, and still come on here as Colorsound?<br /><br />Also, would I still need to install PGP or something similar on to my USB stick?<br /><br />I am not tech savvy, so I don&#039;t know anything about BIOS, would someone be able to help me?<br /><br />Also, if my USB stick is first priority in boot order, does that mean that I will have to go back into BIOS to change it back to c:\ for non-tor user of my computer.<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions, I am really intimidated by all this techy stuff, and I have already made a couple of f*ck ups.<br /><br />Thanks

				pgp is already contained e.g. on liberte.<br /><br />just do a google search in you tor browser like &quot;liberte installation guide&quot;...<br /><br />it does not matter if you go through live usb or torbrowser, you can always logon with you user and password..

				Your live USB is basically another computer hard drive with everything on it that you need to&nbsp; browse anonymously, it would be as if you plugged a new computer into your screen that had linux on it instead of windows.<br /><br />Live USBs are incredibly handy because they come preconfigured and are easy to use, you just have to enter the boot manager for you computer (this will be a function key, F2 or F5 are common it will tell you on your startup screen) and edit the boot order so that USB comes before HD.b<br />Stick in the USB key and reboot and POOF there you are, linux. From here on everyting&#039;s the same as windows for using SR/forums.facebook etc.
