				Dear SR,<br /><br />Why won&#039;t you allow me to sort by price?&nbsp; It allows me to more effectively view stock if only by putting similar priced (and thus usually similar sized) products together.&nbsp; I want to compare apples with apples with apples with oranges with oranges with oranges rather some jumbled combination of the two.<br /><br />Seriously?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Poochie.

				That would be good. Though I haven&#039;t found sorting to actually sort anything. &quot;Domestic Only&quot; doesn&#039;t show me domestic only. I&#039;m patient with it because SR gives me so much more of what I want.

				that is actually a really good idea.<br /><br />I agree SR is for finding the bets product but when comparing 110 pounds a gram coke to 75 pounds a gram coke, the differences are negligible ( compared to street coke anyway)<br /><br />Having said that I enjoy doing my research and watching out for samples and sales and stuff.<br /><br />Before this stupid 50 post minimum thing I did fairly well out of samples, getting coke, MDMA, weed and a couple of pills.<br /><br />I&#039;d like a generic all categories search by price too, for those times when you only have a few bitcents laying around.

				I&#039;d like to see SR allow the option to be sorted by price and quantity.&nbsp; So I can browse the cheap stuff for those last couple coins, but can also compare different vendors prices in 1, 5, and 10 gram amounts too.

				This would be nice, but even better, I&#039;d love to see a wishlist function for product. By the time BTC hits my SR account, I&#039;ve usually browsed to death and have a good set of vendors in mind. Theoretically you can just bookmark item pages, but I guess technically that&#039;s a bad idea from a safety/privacy standpoint.

				Vendors work hard to build a good enough rep to be on the first page, it&#039;s the way it is because these guys bring in loads of sales, if all of a sudden they are pushed to the back page and their sales drop a great deal they might all of a sudden up and think &#039; fuck this I can make more money IRL&#039; and so they leave. <br /><br />And DPR loses a lot of cash. I don&#039;t get why people don&#039;t understand that DPR is a business man, and while he is good to all his sites members he is in this for two things: Revolutionize and to make money. Sole priority is to make money with his website. <br /><br />Just like Mark Zuckerbergs is to make money with Facebook.
