				This will be my only post but just a warning to all Aussie&#039;s.&nbsp; Customs and the AFP have a join operation in progress at the moment targeting illicit drugs in the mail originating from all overseas destinations. My information is they are particularly targeting mail directed to NSW and Queensland address&#039;s however other states are being closely looked at as well.<br /><br />Take this as a warning and stay safe everyone.

				I imagine that this is just at troll.<br /><br />If not, I wouldn&#039;t be worried anyway. With the volume of mail coming from OS, there&#039;s no way they could efficiently find the drugs. Way to waste our tax payers money, fucking pigs.

I wonder how the hell could they ever control mail deliveries. Sure, Australia has fewer people and OS shipping even less parcels, but still the numbers are staggering. They dont stand a chance, I think.

Just assume if there is an operation in place, they will throw more resources at it for the length of the operation. <br /><br />More resources being thrown at something for a period of time, will result in more seizures. It won&#039;t be sustained though after the conclusion of the operation due to the handling of the resources available.<br /><br />Interesting to see if the information is correct and the outcome, if anything is spoken about it at the conclusion.<br /><br />Make sure you choose your vendors wisely. Quick way to get caught up in something like this with a seizure if your vendors packaging techniques are suspicious enough for a second / closer look.<br /><br />ABC

				FK THE FEDS!! 3 Orders, 3 No shows. Its on fiends and friends. My theory is coming up to public holidays, when most kiddies are stocking up for long weekend benders so their chance are better making their haul look a lot better. <br /><br />I also have a feeling that slanty eyed twit who will now be flying around his parents house is partly responsible for any of the shit going down in the State. FKN idiot couldnt just sit the fuck down and play some bongos like any other spaced out tripper. FK! But fear not people, i give these fuckheads 1 week max before they blow their budget, call off the hounds and end up having to cut staff cos they went too hard holding up peoples carepackages and personal mail that it&#039;ll cause backlash of people shitting on the mail system. I propose now we for every letter, package and parcel sent we get another duplicate get sent with nothing in it to fuck them up harddeerrrr and make that sorting shit 10x harder. I dont mind waiting for little longer to get my shit cos it will. @*@&amp;%#@?!# /endrant /smokebowl /relaxxx
