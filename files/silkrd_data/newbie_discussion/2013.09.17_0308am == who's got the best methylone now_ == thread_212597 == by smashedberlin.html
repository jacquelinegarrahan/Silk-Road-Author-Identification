				Drzheng, but I was highly unimpressed with methylone in the first place, seriously, whats the appeal of that drug? Its not even like MDMA is much more expensive and its not the kind of drug class you want to be doing in excess anyways. I mean I guess its better than the average stimulant, but other than that I thought it was a pointless drug. Could you enlighten me as to why people do this stuff? Than again I&#039;d much rather trip in the first place, but an mdma roll is actually pretty amazing in moderation, overuse though makes it lose its magic and it just becomes euphoric and stimulating. Sorry if I seem judgemental I&#039;m just genuinely curious.

				i&#039;ve gotten both from here, and tbh a massive majority prefers the &quot;roll&quot; to the methylone. however the pink so called moon rock makes me nervous with allt he rumors floating around it.

				I can confidently say that I do.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that any other vendor has crystals as large as me.&nbsp; We break all crystals down to under 100 grams for shipping.&nbsp; We usually ship crystals ranging in weight from 5 to 70 grams.&nbsp; Our purity can&#039;t be beat.
