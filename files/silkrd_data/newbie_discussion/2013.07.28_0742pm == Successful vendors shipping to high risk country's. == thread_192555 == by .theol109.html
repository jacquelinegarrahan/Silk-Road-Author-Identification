				I&#039;m trying to get my own personal list of vendors who have a high success rate to high risk country&#039;s my main priority&#039;s are pills and MDMA but also interested in smaller amounts of speed, coke and crystal meth. if you dont want to post names up here you can message me on my sr account theol109<br /><br />Please ensure you have vendors permission before posting name thank you.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t give away any info that can hurt their success rate with shipping we can all understand each other without saying anything directly.<br /><br />cheers guys 109

				SUBTICKLE: from the uk confirmed MDMA excellent quality and awesome shipping times and stealth. ordered many times and will continue to do so.<br /><br />BCPLTD: from the usa confirmed cocaine excellent quality but it was a long time since last used and i only got a small amount. Will continue to use.<br /><br />TECHNOHIPPY: from uk confirmed pills untested, took less than 2 weeks plus he had a big back order to fill so thats good in my opinion stealth was amazing.<br /><br />IVORY: from the uk confirmed MDMA took just over a week didn&#039;t purchase from my account but did pay for it with a friend so i can confirm it was a good munt and stealth was great<br /><br />ill post more when iv tried more.

				I live in a high risk country and just placed an order with HappyTimezz. He offers a 100% refund if its a no show. Have no personal experience with the guy yet but all I hear is great, even though my order has been in &quot;processing&quot; for 4 days in a few hours...

				I live in a strict customs country too.<br /><br />most of my O/S orders I have got from the UK, and they have pretty much all been successful. I will also attest to Subtickle, I have had good transactions with him.<br /><br />but now starting to think about trying other countries such as Canada and Germany, and possibly the Czech Republic. <br /><br />Would love to hear other buyers experience with said companies to strict custom countries if anyone is happy to discuss. If so, please PM me and I will mention the other specific vendors I have had good success with in return! Cheers

				I&#039;ve used CanadianForger and OldAmsterdam. Obviously the Canada isn&#039;t to high risk but I only ever had 1 problem with OldAmsterdam out of 5 transactions all 20+ grams and the time I did have a problem I was given a reship that did arrive. However I have heard of people having problems with him and he can take a few days to get back to you but has worked with me very well.

				Successfully received 50 pills from technohippy and MDMA from Symbiosis on more than 1 occasion.<br /><br />Techno has stopped shipping to Aus for the time being though which is a real disappointment! Hopefully he is back soon.
