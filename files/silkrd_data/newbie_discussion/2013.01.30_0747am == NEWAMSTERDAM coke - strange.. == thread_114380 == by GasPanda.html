				hey, i&#039;m posting here coz of new &quot;50 posts&quot; rule.. otherwise would post in NA&#039;s review thread.<br /><br />i am not a jealous vendor who wants to bugger his business. i just want you people to take care with his gear.. <br />i think he sends out real good stuff and sometimes synthetic stuff,&nbsp; that could explain, why there are so many different opinions about his stuff.<br /><br />dont want to piss on someone, just want to share my experience.. i am not a kiddie and doing coke since 15years, and i get real good stuff sometimes, so i know what i&#039;m talking about.. <br /><br />i took a few tiny lines from NA&#039;s gear. no numbing, no euphoria + very high blood pressure and heart rate. after that i couldnt get to sleep for 4-5hours and had a really evil comedown!<br />normally even when i get very strong stuff, after 1hour i easy get into sleep.<br /><br />next day i took it to my colleague to test it, he had the same problems.<br />well in my case, no one can tell me, this is real Coke. if NA is telling the truth, it must have been my mailman changing stuff on the way..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hello GasPanda,<br /><br />Welcome to the newbie board I hope you enjoy your service here, myself and a moderator are working on a thread where we can offer to post reviews on your behalf with your consent later today. I&#039;m sorry to hear you&#039;ve received unsatisfactory coke from NewAmsterdam, I&#039;ve ordered his coke multiple times, every time it&#039;s been great (my last order was for 1/2 oz) Here&#039;s two posts I&#039;ve made, one for the commenting quality and pictures of what I received dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91689.msg696637#msg696637 and the other where I conducted an EZ Test coke purity test dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91689.msg657316#msg657316 you&#039;ll see the result is dark red meaning &#039;very high content&#039;. I also recommended a couple of &#039;very experienced forum members&#039; to him and they were very satisfied, however these results were conducted mid december and now it&#039;s mid feburary, anything could&#039;ve happened between then and now. I see on his vendors page his feedback has dropped to 93 with many dissatisfied comments as of late silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/09344ef2f0 I&#039;m unsure what&#039;s happened, all I can say is great vendors can go rouge at anytime, there&#039;s always a &#039;risk&#039; of that happening. I personally will not be placing another order with him until he rectifies his situation. Have you stayed in escrow or have you released the funds? If you haven&#039;t,&#039; have you taken a picture of your test result, you need to wipe the EXIF data (information that can real your identity) from your picture (if you don&#039;t know how to do this pm me and I&#039;ll show you) and upload it to an anonymous image uploader such as QicPic xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/ then send a message to &#039;SR Support&#039; through the marketplace silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/104259, NewAmsterdam, and you could also post your test result here too, test results are very important and provide valuable information for making the right a purchase, test results tell the transparent truth. <br /><br />You may like this thread &#039;Cocaine Lab Test Results&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0 PineappleLove posts &#039;dutch lab test results&#039; periodically, I really admire the service he/she/they provide, finally the coke people have our equivalent of the LSD Avengers thread, which I would highly recommend you (or anyone) reads of you&#039;re into your LSD. My best advice is to send a message to SR Support, NewAmsterdam, and if you have your test result (please don&#039;t forget to wipe the EXIF data first!) feel free to post the result. I&#039;m sorry to hear your first post is an unhappy one and if it&#039;s your first purchase I&#039;m very sorry for that too, I sincerely hope you&#039;re able to reach a resolution, and I wish all your future purchases are very happy ones :)

				I had the exact same issue with NA&#039;s coke on a bulk order. Wound up with a bunch of product that LOOKED very nice, but in reality fucked your day/week up. I can remember doing 2 lines at around 9 in the evening and not getting to sleep at around 5 in the morning, just laying there with my eyes closed, listening to my heart beat out of my chest.<br /><br />I actually ordered during the same time as your half ounce Princess. I was so excited tracking your order and when you posted pictures and reagent tests of what you received, I almost shat a brick. What I got was quite the contrary to what you received and I&#039;m inclined to believe what the OP has stated, that he has amazing coke, but he also sends out synthetic product.

Yes, it&#039;s a possibility for him to have two different batches, any vendor could have two different batches of anything at anytime. Do you have any NewAmsterdam&#039;s coke left asd, someone needs to post a test result from his latest batch, it&#039;s very disturbing shit coke ruins your night and can possibly screw up your week physically, mentally, and can wreck havoc with your health nobody, deserves to go through that awful experience especially with a vendor who gained so much trust with so many, my heart goes out to you guys, :&#039;(

				I know this is a bit off topic but all this talk about lack of sleep got me&nbsp; thinking<br /><br />currently the street coke in my area is very cheap, obviously shit quality.<br /><br />Now whenever Ive had some I can never sleep after, the same with mephedrone. back when it was legal it wasn&#039;t so bad but nowadays I could have 3 key bumps and not be able to get to sleep after :(<br /><br />does this have something to do with what they&#039;d be cutting it with?

				Hopefully this doesn&#039;t sound judgmental or whatever, but threads like this make me really glad all I do is weed/hash.&nbsp; Seems like there is a lot more room for scamming with other stuff.<br /><br />As cool of a place as SR is, you can&#039;t change human nature I guess.

				PrincessHIGH, if I find some left in the bag I had it in, or if I didn&#039;t burn the vac wrap like I usually do, I will definitely get residue off of it and test whatever I can. I don&#039;t feel like NA is coming back though. <br /><br />I should mention that NA sent me his &quot;new product&quot; when I mentioned that what he sent me was terrible. My personal opinion is that he sent me my bulk order full of bunk and then sent me his regular batch of coke so that he could get more money out of me. Just a theory.<br /><br />Since this fiasco happened with NA, I haven&#039;t bought coke off SR, nor have I even done street grade coke, again. This guy just kinda put me off. Considering I&#039;ve been doing it for almost a decade and didn&#039;t have any plans on quitting, it MAY be a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy you didn&#039;t get the shitty gear princess, at least SOMEONE could enjoy their dealings with that guy ;)

Honestly, vendors who treat their customers who trust them in good faith like this angers and upsets me, no vendor should EVER treat their customers like this, it&#039;s dirty, disgusting, and despicable behaviour! I hope you have enough left to conduct and post your test result (remember to wipe your EXIF data), and don&#039;t forget to send it to SR Support too.

				Sounds to me like it has some meth in it - it would only take a few grams to put in an ounce of cocaine to make people believe they have high quality shit (especially for users who never do meth), and then experience a long drawn out jaw grinding muscle spazzing comedown where they can&#039;t sleep for hours.<br />I have experienced this myself - and it really really sucks.<br />I would just be guessing here, but it&#039;s always been my belief.<br /><br />I have some great coke for sale that doesn&#039;t fuck with you like that and is real clean, link in my sig.<br />Sorry to hear that though bro - I&#039;ve experienced it and it&#039;s the worst.

I&#039;ll be getting some testing kits asap, taking pictures. SamGiancana&#039;s suggestion makes me want to do a Marquis on it for starters to see if there is any speed or ice in it. Then to the Simons and purity content. <br /><br />I&#039;m honestly not even sure what I should ask for from OA as I got additional product from NA, even though that product wasn&#039;t that good either. I got a 10g order from NA so it was by NO means small potatoes.

Please do the tests for yourself and for everyone who received this &#039;off the mark&#039; gear.

				&nbsp;Those are not typical effects of cocaine and therefore we can conclude that your product is not cocaine.<br /><br />&nbsp;Perhaps its a mixture, featuring cocaine.<br /><br />&nbsp;You should test it yourself, or get it tested.<br /><br />&nbsp;Testing the product yourself is an option and you can toss in an acetone wash to remove some potential impurities.<br /><br />&nbsp;Goodluck
