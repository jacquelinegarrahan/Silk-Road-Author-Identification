				Look i did many times take my time ok had many GOOD and Great Vendors do what they said and did me right over ob there weight all of it , but one time one you get ask to do this finalize early and your fucked , NOW i am telling you now FUCK THEM FUCK THAT AND DONT FUCKING DO IT .&nbsp; I Got Fucked and they do not i am telling you the truth they dont fucking Care ok your on your own here . So you FE because they ask you to they sweet take your ASS they need to move on and you need to move the FUCK on ok , i am Pissed for sure 2,500 is not what i needed to lose ok no way . So for the GOOD vendors thank you , for the Site thats not really giving a fuck about us that have no clue how bad this is and the no really way to protect us other than put in a back up FE button that sends an alram that one the newbees just fucked up untill they learn and truust one time would get me on that i would listen they could cancel it and tell of the vendor them selfs there it is ....

				Trusted vendors such as ETM require FE for newer buyers, is it worth it? good reputation and they seem legitimate although some bad reviews

				Look, you didn&#039;t look into your vendor prior to using them or you would have seen the many threads talking about the fact that they have scammed people.<br /><br />You also apparently failed to read the part where we advise over and over again NEVER to finalize early!<br /><br />The fact that you chose to deal outside of escrow is not SR&#039;s fault - it was your decision, against our recommendation to avoid it at all costs.

				OK but when big sellers with great reviews requires FE for new members (almost all of them). They they have been scammed this way before...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to buy from them eventually, so how ?<br />I guess Ill place small orders FE till they trust me ?

				You never have to FE.&nbsp; There are PLENTY of awesome vendors who do not require buyers to FE.&nbsp; Those are the vendors you should be using.<br /><br />When people go outside of the escrow system, there is nothing we can do to protect them.&nbsp; It&#039;s always a risky, risky thing to do.

				It is not hard to find vendors that take new buyers that do not require FE.&nbsp; I found everything I wanted with ease.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, if I could just buy those things I found here with so much ease.... but then, my money is missing still and well be at 48 hours at 5:56 tonight.<br /><br />As to FE&#039;ing..... I was going to for L, but, after reading all of the burbs of Lucydrop, I think I&#039;ll find someone else that is not so ..... i am not sure of the word ... lazy in their dipping, shall we say?<br /><br />So, to any vendor that presupposes I will FE them:&nbsp; go to fucking hell and eat shit.
