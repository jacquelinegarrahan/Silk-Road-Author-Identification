				I just bought a qp of trim from him, I haven&#039;t FE&#039;d, I&#039;ll let you all know when it ships. In the meantime, has anyone had any success dealing with this guy?<br /><br />UPDATE: my order arrived, great packaging, smokes and bakes well, definitely an awesome deal. 2 days to process and 3 to ship, so 5 days total, which is speedy as fuck imo. his trim listing is down now but i&#039;ll definitely let you know when it does. His lack of forum presence sketched me out so I was pleasantly surprised when everything turned out so well.

				He&#039;s offering a QP for around $180. Is he the fuzz or what? What&#039;s the catch? <br /><br />

				***UPDATE***<br />My order got here last saturday, took 2days processing and 3days shipping. It looks less like shake and more like thick kief. Smokes really well, cooks really well, gets made into hash oil really well. I was really sketched out by his lack of a forum presence but it looks like he is the real deal.

				Anyone else bought his qp of trim/shake? I was thinking of buying one, but the lack of reviews on the forums is kinda sketchy to me

				I got an oz of the trim/shake a couple of weeks ago. It&#039;s a typical trim/shake mix: quite harsh to smoke but otherwise very good value for money.

				I have been contemplating purchasing a QP of his trim myself. It would be nice to have some of the more established people on the forums test it out and post a review. If I decide to grab some I will be sure to come here and post a solid review on it. There is no FE required, so probably not a scammer.

				Edit: seller marked my package as in transit after I wrote this message. I&#039;m taking down my posts as promised, hoping that he is not doing so in retaliation for me writing a negative review (although he still has not messaged me back once which would have solved everything from the beginning).
