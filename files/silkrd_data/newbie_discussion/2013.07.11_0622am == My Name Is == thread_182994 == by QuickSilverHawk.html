				Another self-aggrandizing bump.<br /><br />Learned today that the TorMail username &quot;quicksilverhawk&quot; is already in use, so that&#039;s not me.<br />Since I&#039;m still in infancy, at the moment I don&#039;t really see a need for me to utilize TorMail for SR business.<br /><br />Even though I don&#039;t know who on the forums correspond to which customers, I wanted to express general thanks.<br />When I initiated my SR life as a vendor, I didn&#039;t know what I was getting into. In retrospect, I may have been on too many disinhibiting drugs at the time I posted bond.<br />My first steps were embarrassingly clumsy, and that&#039;s no understatement. My first handful of customers were overwhelmingly gracious, patient, helpful. I&#039;m grateful.<br />I&#039;ve grown a lot in the past few weeks. I&#039;ve settled into my little groove, gotten a handle on my &quot;wheelings and dealings&quot;.

It might seem pointless now, but could prevent impersonation scams down the road. Not that it&#039;s guaranteed, just possible. Specify a different address for off-SR communication, or explicitly state that you are currently not using any.

				Sorry about that, dude.<br /><br />I figured that since my vendor account is young, if I want to make some sales, I need to mark down some of my products.<br />The Halcion sale pricing is a temporary thing, at least until I make a few successful sales to funnel towards more inventory.

They sell decently. IMHO there isn&#039;t much of a market for a benzo people are given before surgery so I didn&#039;t restock them. Hell, I&#039;m having a hard time trying to sell brotizolam and loprazolam. There is a market for the exotics, but it&#039;s a bit small compared to the standard core benzodizepines.
