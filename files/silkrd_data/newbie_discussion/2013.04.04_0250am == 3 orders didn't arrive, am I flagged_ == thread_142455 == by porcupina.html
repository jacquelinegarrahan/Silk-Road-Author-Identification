				I&#039;ve been ordering for a year with no problem, including from overseas. But my last 3 orders (all overseas) didn&#039;t arrive. Two were from the same vendor, and one was from a different vendor (but one I&#039;d used previously with no problems).<br /><br />So ....is it a fluke, or has Customs flagged me? And if they have, how long does flagging usually last? Is it permanent? <br /><br />Are there ways around this?<br /><br />Do I need to move in order to buy drugs again?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				No way to know for sure if you are flagged or not, I don&#039;t think. However, this does sound fishy. If I were you, I would ask a friend if you can use their address for ALL further deliveries. It&#039;s not worth the risk. Best of luck to you!

				You&#039;d want to be careful, I have no proof of what limit or anything that LE decide to intervene.&nbsp; However you can almost be certain if they notice a trend, they will come looking for you.&nbsp; Just as another point, keep your house and workplace clean, if they come looking for you, you don&#039;t want to have anything lying around that would incriminate you.<br /><br />Probably best to get a new address that can&#039;t be traced back to you, and I wouldn&#039;t use a friend, what if they got arrested on your behalf?

				Were these intl vendors all reputable? Have you browsed through their forums to see if it&#039;s a common problem amongst them? Are they from NL by any chance? I know there have been many discussions of NL vendors selectively not sending products on the common misconception that customs are significantly more militant towards packages sourced from there. They can easily put the blame on this &quot;fact&quot; and offer a 50% refund without ever having sent the product. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if other EU vendors do this as well to compensate for fraud. This is not completely certain of course but I would take them into consideration and order domestic for the time being.

				The vendor where it happened twice in a row is in Germany, tons of feedback though, nearly all of it good -- but a few &quot;never received.&quot; The other vendor is in NL, also tons of good feedback with a few &quot;never received.&quot; It&#039;s an interesting question!

				I wouldn&#039;t ship to a friend&#039;s house unless he consented to receive for you. If your package is intercepted at customs they will send you a love letter if it&#039;s for personal amounts. If you&#039;re trying to import a kilo of coke or over 100grams of anything, they might make an exception and try for a controlled delivery.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered 25gram MDMA from Germany, UK, and NL. Never had a problem but I suspect they wouldn&#039;t put much effort into going after such a small amount. I don&#039;t know for sure though and could be wrong. If you get something intercepted though, you can pretty much bet your ass your name will be on a list somewhere.

				There are too many variables to have hard and fast answers to your question. The whole &quot;flagging&quot; thing is a myth. Yes if customs were to intercept a few major packages all going to the same address they may place that name and address on a list somewhere but to think that they can just flip a switch and flag every address that a package is addressed to is insane. People move all the time. Customs deals with thousands and thousands of packages. Their goal is to catch as many dangerous items, and major weight packages they can. They have no where near the resources to go after every single package of personal use amount they catch. Your supplier will probably want you to switch to a new address and it&#039;s probably a good idea to switch to a new address. Until you get seizure letters in the mail there is no real way of telling what&#039;s going on. Unless your packages contained large amounts of highly scheduled substances the odds they would try a control on you are very small. Your best bet is to set up an account with a remailer service. They receive the packages and foward them to you. They require ID and phone number though, so you&#039;ll probably want to invest in a fake ID and a burner first.

				Super helpful, thank you.<br /><br />So do they really generally send you a letter if they seize something? I haven&#039;t received any letters, so that&#039;s a good sign, I guess, and points to this being more of a fluke?<br /><br />I would like to continue ordering things! :)
