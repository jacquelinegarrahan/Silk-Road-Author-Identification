				My order arrived pretty quickly to EU. Good stealth too and I had quality tested, you can see the result here:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8i.jpeg<br /><br />I guess a country like Peru is a high risk purchase. Didn&#039;t have to deal with refunds though. Low price + high quality = high risk I guess.<br /><br />I hope it works out for you guys.

I realize a vendor could scam cashing in 50% without sending nothing. And it occurred to me he didn&#039;t send mine. <br />I dunno if OP is legit. <br /><br />But pepinamil uses a translator to communicate in English. <br />Anyways we&#039;ll never know and I doubt this thread will bring him a lot of business. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say if this was pepinamil batch, it looks good, but we don&#039;t know. We know not many parcels gets through. <br /><br />Peace out <br />Jason.

				you have to be insane or have a lot of money to spare to order from this kind of &quot;vendors&quot;. If you want to save some money you can send it to me. I will even give you a discount 12,50/gram. Just ask for info.
