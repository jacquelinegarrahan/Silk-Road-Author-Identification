				This was my first transaction from a vendor outside the UK so i was a little worried at first and sent BioGrow a message asking his success rate to the UK. A very understanding reply came back within a few hours reassuring me there had been no problems.<br /><br />I decided to place an order for 5g&#039;s on Sunday and it was &#039;In-Transit&#039; by early Monday morning. The following day i noticed BioGrow had added a 10g listing for only another 1.6 BTC and I decided to message him seeing if i could upgrade my 5g order to 10g&#039;s and pay the difference + postage. He kindly agreed and created a custom listing for me. It was also &#039;In-Transit&#039; the next morning.<br /><br />Both packages arrived on Friday morning. I don&#039;t want to give away to much about his packaging but it was VERY good and each 5g&#039;s packet was double vacuum sealed. Some of the best packaging Ive seen on the Road. <br /><br />Product looked good, nice and dry and ground up very nicely, pure buds, smell was ok, taste was very natural, in my opinion how weed is supposed to taste. Potency was much stronger than expected. Really strong stuff for the price. Didn&#039;t have scales when it arrived so i couldn&#039;t tell you the exact weight but looked bang on if not slightly overweight. I now have scales and would weigh it but it&#039;s all been smoked because i enjoyed it so much ;)<br /><br />Overall i would have to give BioGrow a 5/5 on everything, i cannot fault this vendor and highly recommend trying his product, you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />Speed of delivery 5/5<br />Communication 5/5<br />Packaging 5/5<br />Product 5/5<br /><br />I&#039;m so impressed im placing another order for 30g&#039;s tomorrow.<br /><br />Hope this review has been useful for people interested in his products.<br /><br />Thanks,
