				Yeah they are legit. Currently in stealth mode though, the message on their page is this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*******URGENT WE ARE SORRY TO EVERYONE WHO HAD ORDERS THIS PAST WEEK WE WERE EXPERIENCING CONSTANT BLACKOUTS AND IT RUINED CELL TOWERS SO COULDNT USE HOTSPOT ONCE AGAIN WE ARE VERY SORRY WE UNDERSTAND IF THIS RESULTS IN BAD REVIEWS BUT THIS WAS ENTIRELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL******</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They had to deal with quite a backlog too, I believe they got popular fast due to word getting around about their high quality meth. I have an order on the way, hoping the quality remains high. :)

				Ordered from CTM in August.&nbsp; Had a positive experience.&nbsp; Arrived fast.&nbsp; Good quality stuff.&nbsp; Like someone else said - I think they got swamped quickly because the reliable vendors have disappeared and scammers have filled the void.&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking of scammers - I received my order from WARBEAST - an 8ball of isopropylbenzylamine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Little if any real meth in it.&nbsp; It burns and smokes just like isopropylbenzylamine and makes you tired, worn out, itchy eyes and lethargic.&nbsp; Someone else mention in their review that it made them tired, but gave him 5 stars anyway.&nbsp; WTF is wrong with people.&nbsp; When is it acceptable to get ripped off ?&nbsp; &nbsp;The RESOLVE process is there for a reason - use it.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t say anything then others like you will get ripped off too.&nbsp; If someone before you had called the scammer out, maybe you wouldn&#039;t have been ripped off.&nbsp; This is a community - people in a community watch out for each other and notify one another when the wolves come in from out of town and prey on the people.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway back to CTM - I think he is legit as I said I had one very good experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#039;t order again from him because he was in stealth and having his backlog problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bet he will get it worked out because he was pretty damned impressive when it came to shipping, customer service and product.&nbsp;

				Hi all.&nbsp; Hoping for a little guidance from you folks.<br /><br />Placed my first order ever with Chi Town on Wednesday afternoon and it&#039;s still in processing.&nbsp; Part of this could be due to me using the pgp key incorrectly when forwarding my address, but I sent the correctly encrypted version a few minutes later and Chi Town verified that they had it on Thursday afternoon.<br /><br />Right after I ordered with Chi Town, I placed an order for some rigs with another vendor and that order was market in transit the next morning.<br /><br />Am I being too impatient here or should I just send Chi Town another message asking what&#039;s up, then cancel if I don&#039;t hear back in the affirmative within a few hours?

				Wanted to provide an update.<br /><br />The package was market in transit this morning, so I&#039;d be surprised if I don&#039;t have it in hand by Wednesday.&nbsp; Once it shows up, I&#039;ll sample immediately then post up a review of the packaging, quality, etc.<br /><br />Hope y&#039;all are having a good weekend.

				Please let us know if everything works out with CTM. After gearing up to make my first purchase you could not imagine how disappointed I was to read the Meth Vendor forum. It seems like everyone has shit and CTM is probably the best with it just being just &quot;OK.&quot; And many of the positive reviews of other vendors are most likely from people who truly do not know what good meth is.<br /><br />I am a longtime meth user who has took a ten year break and wanting to get some good shit to relieve those days of Rocket Fuel that had you rewiring your house after a good bowl. But after 10 years I have no more connections.<br /><br />For know I am just going to wait it out and see what happens. Though I have never tried MDMA and that is peaking my interest.<br /><br />Good luck with CTM I hope it works out.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
