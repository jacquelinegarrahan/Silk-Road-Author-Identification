				Good day gentleman. Just wanted to say hey and tell you guys that this is my first time on this forum, and i made my first purchase on SR yesterday afternoon, so I am fairly new all around.&nbsp; Bought 2 things from deluxedelivery, so I&#039;m hoping that goes through without a hitch. Although its been 24 hours and it still says processing.. and he hasn&#039;t responded to my messeges yet. I hope he understands that everyone has to make they&#039;re First purchase at some time, and doesn&#039;t discriminate me because I have technically no credibility or purchase record.<br />Well fingers crossed, and I will talk to you all again soon! Enjoy guys

				quick question.. so after my purchase, i currently have .13 bitcoins left over in my account. now i am looking at what I can buy for that ammount and all i have found was 1 hit of some psycadelic&nbsp; for .13, but when i add to cart, sr tells me i don&#039;t have the required funds.. so this brings my total down to .12 bitcoins. Anyone have a link of what i can purchase for .12? i can&#039;t seem to get it to browse by price.. price is one factor, but what i dont want to do is throw money away to someone who won&#039;t give me what I purchased -_-

				ill send you naked pics of myself for those btc...seriously though, i dont think you can buy anything with that small of an amount. Unless you want to buy some ebooks, those are dirt cheap, and it will help you get to 10 purchases easier so you wont have to FE all the time
