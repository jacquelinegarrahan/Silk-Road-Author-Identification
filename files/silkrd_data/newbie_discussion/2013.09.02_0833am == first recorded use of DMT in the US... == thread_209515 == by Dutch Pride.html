				The first recorded use of DMT in the United States is by one of the forgotten pioneers of the original psychedelic era, the Beverly Hills psychiatrist Oscar Janiger, who would be responsible for introducing LSD to a number of the Los Angeles elite in the lates 1950’s including Anais Nin, Cary Grant, and others. After the discovery of the properties of mescaline and LSD within the psychiatric community, the search for other psycho-active compounds intensified. Janiger himself was intrigued by the Osmond/Smythesis thesis that psychoses might be caused by a metabolic malfuntion of the adrenal system. Humphrey Osmond had noticed the molecular similarity between mescaline and adrenalin; and with a remarkable show of intuition, Janiger noticed the similarity between brain tryptamines (i.e. serotonin) and a South American vine used in shamanic rites – ayahuasca – whose psychoactive element was thought to be dimethyltryptamine. (Note: The research that Janiger had read must have analyzed the actual ayahuasca&nbsp; potion, and not the ayahusca&nbsp; vine itself, since the Banisteriopsis caapi vine does not contain any DMT itself.) Searching the medical literature for further references about DMT, Janiger discovered Stephen Szara’s research (in Hungarian) and surmising that his Hungarian counter-parts must have tried DMT and survived to be able to write their monographs, Janiger had the local laboratory make him&nbsp; batch, and one afternoon while he was alone in his office he filled a syringe and shot it into his arm – in his own words, “a dangerously stupid, idiotic thing to do.”<br /><br />Compared to DMT, LSD was like a lazy summer picnic. Janiger felt like he was inside a pin-ball machine, bombarded by flashing lights, clanging bells, infernal messages. There was no insight. He was lost, disconnected, and when he later regained consciousness (the DMT lasted only thirty minutes) he was convinced he had been “totally stark raving crazy.” Which was terrific! Perhaps he had found the elusive M factor.<br />&nbsp;<br />Janiger gave DMT to Bivens, who agreed it was too much, then he called up Alan Watts and bet him he had a drug that could finally shut him up. Watts took the bet and the DMT, and for thirty minutes he lay there staring at Janiger, who kept repeating “Alan, Alan, please say something. Talk to me. Your reputation is at stake.” But Watts never said a word. The next time Al Hubbard passed through the town, Janiger gave him a supply of DMT for his leather bag and asked him to distribute it along the circuit. “This isn’t a gift,” he said. “I want reports back.” Everyone who took DMT agreed it was a hellish half hour, with absolutely no redeeming qualities.<br />&nbsp;

				Yeah Burroughs pretty much thought the same thing when he first tried it. He called it a &quot;terrorizer&quot; drug if i&#039;m not mistaken.<br /><br />I always wondered though: was their DMT solution simply too potent or were they using too much? Because DMT in a decent sized dose (those famous three hits) is indeed strong as hell, but remains more often than not a fairly pleasurable state of being, at least in my limited experience.<br />

				Ye i&#039;m not really sure either but these guys were shooting up labgrade dmt without having any idea of what a dose was, so i guess they could have overdone it a little...lol<br /><br />A friend of mine did the same once....just eyeballed it a little and shot it in his vain.....Later he claimed he was chased through the universe by hindu gods who wanted to rip out his soul...hahaha..<br /><br />
