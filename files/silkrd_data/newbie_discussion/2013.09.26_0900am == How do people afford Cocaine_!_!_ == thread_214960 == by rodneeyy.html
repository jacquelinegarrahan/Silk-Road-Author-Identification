				Cocaine hits you at about £100 a g for high quality which seems to be the popular type on silkroad but how can people afford £100 a gram and it only lasts you about 1 night, its a very expensive drug and lifestyle how do you guys do it?

				Cocaine is God&#039;s way of telling us we have too much money, to be honest after I&#039;d got my day&#039;s supply of heroin I&#039;d spend anything left over on Cocaine whether it was £10 or £1000 but truly nobody can afford a cocaine habit as it includes an unsustainable lavish lifestyle...i do it occasionally now and never found it to be physically addictive just very moreish.

They tend to save it for infrequent use.<br /><br />Then again, maybe all the big coke buyers are just rich Eton schoolboy politicians from the Houses of Charliement ;)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Income is on a spectrum. $150 is a significant part of some people&#039;s income, while for other people it&#039;s not a significant part.<br /><br />A lot of times, those people with extra cash are seeking release from the pressures of their daily work more than just a high for the sake of being high. Sometimes, making a lot of money comes with a lot of stress. So for them, getting a few minutes/hours of release is worth it. Coke carries a lot of baggage, but it does provide that. This is probably why it tends to be a drug for people with higher incomes - not only can they afford it, they want the release more.

				1 gram in a night? I never tried coke as its not really available where I live, but i always thought 100-200mg of good coke would be enough for a night? 20mg line every hour or so. But with the moreishnes I can see how that might not be possible :p

				With good coke, 1g a night is a crapton. Not to say some people aren&#039;t doing that level, and you can certainly increase your tolerance to that much or more if you&#039;re a heavy regular user. But generally that implies lower quality C. Most HQ lines are 20-50 mg, so 10 lines is 200-500mg. So if you have good stuff, most times 200-400g/night is quite a bit.<br /><br />This is just my opinion - anyone have a different experience?

				I really like that high quality cocaine is so expensive, otherwise I would do it far more often than I do currently. The prices make it nothing more than a rare treat for me which is much nicer on my heart as well as my nose.

				a whole gram of good quality coke is way too much for most weekend warriors to do in one night. if you develop a habit it&#039;s quite easy to do, your tolerance skyrockets after only a couple of days doing it on the trot. i used to sell decent coke locally to pay for my habit which was going on for a henry a day. quality dropped so i stopped selling. now i just have a bit here and there, and 0.3 is more than enough for a night out for me now

				Lol in Aus it&#039;s like $300 -$400 a gram. I wish I was in Canada. You can get 3-4 times as much for the same cost.

				lol... i dunno if you have ANY idea what ur talking about, But coke here costs $400 a gram for %20 cocaine and lasts a few hours, and thats NOT dear, So unless ur taking speed or some other substance made in a jail toilet, Its not an expensive drug at all, Especially when im getting a ball on here for $540 instead of $400 a gram... And im getting 80+% not 20%.....

				I tell you how most of the real coke heads finance their habit.<br />They buy 100 euro of pure shit gram.<br /><br />they keep half for themselve, and cut the other half into 2 grams with ritalin, lidocaine or procaine, mannitol, caffeine.<br /><br />they sell the cut 2 grams for 50 a gram.<br /><br />Tada, you got urself free 0.5 of pure shit.<br /><br />Do get high of your own supply.

				For me, if I have a gram I can go through it in a few hours even if its really pure. The problem is your nose gets fucked up real quick. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t do coke heavy every day. <br /><br />Crack is a different thing altogether, you can go through grams like nothin, but I quit that shit and now I only sell it. But if I wanted to spike I could easily get past a grm a day. <br /><br />Thank god most peoples aren&#039;t good with will power cause I&#039;d be outta business quick.

				I don&#039;t know... i consider it one of the best drugs ever if the quality is good. But for most people its just too much money and its difficult to find decent stuff.
