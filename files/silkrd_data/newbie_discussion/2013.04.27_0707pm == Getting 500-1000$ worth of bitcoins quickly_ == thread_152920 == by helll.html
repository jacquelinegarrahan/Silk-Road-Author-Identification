				Been out of the SR loop for a while.&nbsp; Last time I needed to transfer more than 500$, I did a BitInstant bank deposit.&nbsp; Now it seems that option no longer exists.<br /><br />What&#039;s the quickest way to transfer 500-1000$ into Bitcoin nowadays?

				LocalBitcoins.com is reliable for face to face cash transfers or you could pay into their personal bank account, wire etc. The mark up is high though like 10 percent, but the system is very well set.

Obviously they&#039;re not accepting them anymore.<br /><br />I still use BitInstant. They accept Moneygram at CVS, Walmart, and just about anywhere else that accepts MG transfers (many bodegas if you live somewhere urban). <br /><br />They allow Tor use for placing orders which is awesome.<br /><br />There&#039;s a $500 per day limit though. There&#039;s also a $3.95 fee from the payment processor, so you can only enter $496.05 into BI&#039;s system, the fee brings it up to $500 even.<br /><br />If you want to do $1000, you have to split it over 2 days or split it between two &quot;different people.&quot;<br /><br />They have multiple ways to choose how to receive your funds: you can have them deposited as a cash into your Gox account or you can have the cash converted to coin and sent to an email or to a bitcoin address. Just don&#039;t send it to a Tormail email addy -- it goes down way too often and you&#039;ll get fucked over). There&#039;s also BitStamp, VirWox, and VouchX as options, but I&#039;ve never used those.<br /><br />Even on Sundays, you have the funds within an hour of deposit.<br /><br />Here are the only two issues: 1) If you get them converted to coin and don&#039;t plan to use them immediately, then you can get fucked over by deflation; 2) If you use MtGox, you can&#039;t use Tor.<br /><br />But otherwise, BitInstant hasn&#039;t let me down once in the last year. I&#039;ve never had a major problem and there Customer Service team is FUCKING AWESOME!<br /><br />PS If you do do MG deposits, the trick is to tell the cashier that there&#039;s no fee (it&#039;s already included). If you mention the $3.95 fee, it fucks the whole system up and they can&#039;t process it (that had me trippin for a couple days LOL)

				Bitinstant seems to be an excellent option for USA, but for other countries deposit options are&nbsp; very limited.
