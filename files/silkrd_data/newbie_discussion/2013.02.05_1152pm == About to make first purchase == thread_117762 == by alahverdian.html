				So, after registering about a week ago and doing my research, I am thinking about pulling the trigger on my first purchase. Thinking I might do a 1/2 of the outdoor bubba from wheels420. Any newer buyers have experience dealing with him? Thoughts?<br /><br />

				The quality appears to be just what I am looking for, a good &quot;bang for your buck&quot; purchase.<br /><br />I sent wheels420 a message and have not heard back yet. Does wheels420 push for FE as a new purchaser? Any issues with cancelled orders, etc?

				I would never order bud from SR.&nbsp; Or pretty much anything that has a strong odor. <br /><br />Psychedelics and and pills are the only thing I&#039;ll order considering they&#039;re easy to ship stealth, are fairly colorless, and are odorless.&nbsp; <br /><br />Call me paranoid but I think a dog can smell bud in a mailing room.&nbsp; It can&#039;t smell a few micrograms of LSD though hidden inside a hallmark birthday card.

				Thanks lucy! I am looking forward to it. I recently moved to a new city and don&#039;t have any connections here, so I thought I would give SR a shot. <br />Looking forward to it<br /><br />greenalfalfa, this is something I have considered, but if the vendor has a good reputation for shipping stealth and people have been getting their product, I figure I&#039;ll give it a shot and see how it goes.<br />

				Good luck. I have not ordered from that vendor yet. I think the majority of the sales on SR are for bud considering the amount of listings.

				Thank you everyone!<br /><br />Heard back from wheels420 and everything sounds like its on the up and up. He said they do NOT require FE for new users as that defeats the purpose of it. It is something the customer can choose to do with a trusted vendor if they so desire, but it is up to the customer.<br />Everything sounds great.<br />Will definitely be ordering from wheels420 when my coin finally comes through.<br /><br />GOD BLESS

				Not OP but i finally recieved my package for my first order on SR after lurking for almost a year since i have connections to get what i want but i couldn&#039;t get any weed recently and i was always interested to buy off SR because of feedback from these forums and other places and wanted to do it correctly. Bought from Kindbud and had a tiny problem at first with the order being &quot;undeliverable as addressed&quot; but the vendor reshipped and i was surprised with the stealth and the quality of the weed. The shipping was so good that whatever first buy jitters i had is gone forever and i may use SR alot more instead of buying IRL.
