				Pretty funny how I found out about SR, googled something totally unrelated and this came up a bit down the page.<br /><br />That was a couple of weeks ago and I&#039;ve spent hours reading about encryption and bitcoins. I have set up new email addresses and researched bitcoin vendors and I think I&#039;m getting ready to make my first purchase.<br /><br />Problem is I&#039;m on 3.2mg of Subutex and I&#039;m absolutely gagging to get my hands on some of the gear that&#039;s available. I gave gear up because the quality was just so shit where I live, there is one guy that had some shit hot stuff but he could keep you waiting for HOURS - &#039;ring me in an hour and ill be ready&#039; - &#039;ring me in an hour and ill be ready&#039;! So I jacked it in, been clean for a couple of years after having a relapse for a year after being off it for 7 after been on it for 8 years, still with me!!!???<br /><br />I am actually a vendor of a different flavour to a few select friends, so I reckon I&#039;ll make a few test purchases just to see how it comes back to me, not necessarily drugs, see how it goes and may be offer my product to the SR community as it is quality, it looks the same as some of the other vendors on here.<br /><br />Problem is I&#039;m dreaming about smack every night now, I&#039;m torturing myself looking at a few vendors gear, it&#039;s proper bad, I&#039;ve a bit of dosh in the bank, nice house, mint girlfriend everything&#039;s going well and I&#039;m thinking this isn&#039;t the place for me as I LOVE A DECENT BAG!!!!!!<br /><br />Just can&#039;t help myself though, it&#039;s just so damn intriguing and I like getting my head round technology.<br /><br />Anyone else in the same boat?

				I battle opiate addiction my self. I actually am utilizing silk road to stay off the tempting streets that you cant walk through without 4-5 people hollering at you every few blocks. I&#039;ve been on methadone self medicating and suboxone thru a doc. I think that suboxone is only good short term, I finally realized that ultimately you will have to withdrawal in some way. I used to think I wouldnt be addicted to suboxone if I used it and stopped, boy was I wrong. I kicked suboxone, took two weeks or so to feel 100% (on for a year btw). I think subutex is a lil different then suboxone due to suboxone having naloxone which reduces craves.<br /><br />Anyway to be honest unless you have a lot of money or steady income, silk road prob isnt the best place for an opiate addiction&nbsp; :-\ ... look into vivitrol, it keeps you clean if you take the shot every 30 days but is expensive, welcome to the road<br /><br />*by the way I fell during the holidays so I&#039;m only clean 6 days ATM cuz my deductible hadnt been met so I had to get the money for the expensive vivtrol , 2 more days and I can get my shot, you gotta be clean 7-10 days to take it or risk precipitated WD

				Good to hear Cafegirl,<br /><br />I agree with Yoda, try Ibogaine, It can be hellish, but you will love life after the 18+ hours, + maybe 1 nights sleep first.<br /><br />Welcome again&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				There was a time when I was with you also. These days I&#039;m just on to look for psychedelics etc, to expand life and the mind rather contract it. Its a hard path, but I&#039;d say stay away. Even the best gear isn&#039;t really worth it, or only is for a couple of hours anyway. Good luck.
