				Owning and managing a grow operation seems to be a very fulfilling and peaceful thing especially if you can do it &quot;legally&quot;.<br /><br />A dream job is something you do where it doesn&#039;t feel like a job, especially something that you would do even if you weren&#039;t getting paid.<br /><br />Most of the time, you would have to &quot;shape&quot; your passions to conform to a market need, so there&#039;s usually a compromise. However, sometimes, you don&#039;t. For example, programmers just love to program anything. They contribute to open source without compensation and love it. Thus, it&#039;s just a natural extension that they do some programming for pay as well.

				private island caretaker for someone I really like/admire/respect/get along with. Would be great to have my own private island for 45+ weeks/yr (the family I am a caretaker for obviously doesn&#039;t live on their island - it&#039;s a vaca place for them). Would just landscape and keep up the grounds, do drugs, play with my dogs, and cook in their amazing kitchen. Would also be a huge bonus if they kept a massive record collection at their island home.

				LSD tester? I trip balls and people study me? I&#039;d be bout it.<br /><br />Win lottery and ball out for 10 years and then be a stay at home dad with all kinds of toys.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m gonna fucking become a civil engineer... Design septic tanks for playgrounds... Little kids can take shits.&quot;<br /><br />But realistically, I would love to be a pilot. I&#039;ve always loved flying and I would never dread a day of work if I was a pilot. I don&#039;t care if I&#039;m a crop duster or running an airliner, I just want to fly. <br /><br />PsychedelicSphere

				I want to run a trip center (I like the name &quot;Discovery Zone&quot;) where people can come to do hallucinogens, MDMA, or other drugs in a safe environment suitable to the experience they&#039;re looking to have. There could be all types of rooms, some acid-type rooms with lights shining trippy ever-changing patterns on the walls, a chill-out room, a dance room, etc each with suitable music. In an ideal society people would have such a place where they could come and explore their consciousness worry-free of interference from LE or judgment from other people not like them and those that choose not to partake wouldn&#039;t have to worry about crazy trippers running around town eating peoples faces or their kids ODing at a club from an RC.<br /><br />That would be sweet.
