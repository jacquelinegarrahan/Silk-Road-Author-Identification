				There&#039;s a bit of a problem with this... you&#039;d have to import 100 times in order to give an accurate&nbsp; answer, and there&#039;s nothing above 1 in 100 either...<br /><br />A second flaw I would highlight, is that the success of the war on drugs is unrelated to seizures at borders... in fact, the larger the quantity of seizures then the higher the price of drugs, which in turn will increase the supply of drugs as people find out they can sell them for&nbsp; more in the affected area, pushing the prices back down again.&nbsp;

				I misread the topic and thought it said &#039;costumes&#039;. For a moment I had this image in my mind of a guy in a Mickey Mouse costume demanding me to hand over my drugs. :-)
