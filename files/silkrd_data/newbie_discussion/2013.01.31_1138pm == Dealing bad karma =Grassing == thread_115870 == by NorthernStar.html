				I have noticed how some people sneak on your profile and give you a proverbial stabbing in the back, In the shape of a bad karma. They&#039;re like them snakes at school who used to run to the principle, or in my case headmaster, and sing like a canary. You know the slimy looking ones. I think transparency is called for here, whoever stabs you in the back, should have to front you, and explain their slimy<br />deed. That way you can&#039;t be negatively&nbsp; effected by someone who has the intellectual capacity of a lump of jelly, and who doesn&#039;t understand your point so proceeds to stitch you up. :-X

				wds, karma is especially meaningful on an anonymous forum, because it means that the holder of that account has the respect (or disrespect) of the community. An account with a lot of karma will generally be viewed as more reliable than one with low good karma and a lot of bad karma.

				Honestly, I care. <br /><br />And so do a lot of people. It&#039;s nice to have some indicator of the abrasiveness of someones post history. <br /><br />Nice posters have a good karma ratio.. it actually works. <br /><br />And it&#039;s good to be nice to each other... even on an anonymous forum. <br /><br />Be safe, <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy<br /><br />

I have another forum profile in which i have over 1500 posts, and over 100 karma, and less than -50.<br />i just use this account to give vendor reviews, as to not link profiles.<br /><br />karma means NOTHING. especially when NomadBloodBath has a thread titled POSITIVE KARMA. where people post, and give other users karma, without having done anything, with the expectation they will receive positive karma in return. not dissing nomad, props on the thread, and will be happy to rib him more about it on irc, but this is just one example of why karma is USELESS for judging people. IMHO the only way is to chat on irc.<br /><br />i see a ton of fuckwits on the forums with over 150+karma, and been members for only a couple months, check their postcount etc... and all their posts are in the karma thread.<br /><br />maple... your retort? :p
