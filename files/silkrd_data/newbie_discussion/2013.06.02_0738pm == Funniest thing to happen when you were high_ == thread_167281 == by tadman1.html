				Anything remotely funny..... on psychedelics. <br /><br />I remember one time we and a few buddies were on a shroom trip I only had an eighth my other friend had about 5gs. I said something stupid like a never ending blunt would be the answer for world peace and at the time we just laughed and laughed.
