				Hello fellow SR memebers. <br /><br />We would like to announce the opening of our vending profile.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are all stocked up and hopefully won&#039;t run out any time soon. <br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />We are South Africa&#039;s newest weed vendors.<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />The Dagga Couple<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />We ship worldwide! (FREE SHIPPING)<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />We do not require FE! (great for first time buyers and trusted members alike.)<br /><br />ONLY FINALIZE ONCE YOU&#039;VE TAKEN FIRST PUFF TO GIVE GOOD FEEDBACK<br /><br />We are not here to make money and most of our profits go towards helping The Dagga Couple with their court case so if you scam us or give bad ratings we will be forced to shut down our service. We reserve the right to do or not do business with anyone at our discretion<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />We source the best exotic skunk hybrids from SWAZILAND! the birthplace of Swazigold.<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Our skunks are all top quality dutch strains crossed with local swazi skunk hybrids to produce dank ass bud that will knock you over but won&#039;t leave your BTC balance empty.<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Our bud has no seeds or storks and is put thru a kitchen sieve and then vacuum sealed and then packaged flat in a mylar bag as to post discrete envelopes worldwide.<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />DO NOT EXPECT FLUFFY BUD!! IT WILL BE BUD THAT HAS EITHER BEEN MADE INTO CRUSH OR IT IS FLAT PACKAGED. FOR YOUR SAFETY NOT MINE! DO NOT ORDER IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT CRUSHED (SIEVED) or COMPRESSED BUD IS!<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />We strive to bring you top quality smoke at rock bottom prices.<br /><br />50% of all our profits will be anonymously donated to the South African Dagga Couple to help with their court case.<br /><br />You can read more about them and their cause at http://www.daggacouple.co.za<br /><br />The Dagga Couple (a phrase coined by the South African press) have, for almost three years now, been preparing a case to apply for the opportunity to ask some very simple questions in the highest court in South Africa, The Constitutional Court. How come this benign, useful, non toxic, non lethal plant has lead to the persecution of so many people, in so many countries, for so long?<br /><br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/89550535b5

				You should look into shipping the buds non crushed/compressed, I believe you will lose a lot of potential sales due to the fact that your bud is compressed.

				Thanks Steelo. <br /><br />We do realize this but we want to stay as stealth as possible. <br /><br />That&#039;s why we have stated so clearly the buds will be destroyed in the process of packing.<br /><br />We have not worked out a way that we feel comfortable on&nbsp; how to pack big buds and post international as of yet.<br /><br />We are 100% sure that flat packed stealth packaging we are using at the moment will get anywhere in the world. <br /><br />

				Hi Daggacouple<br /><br />For customer service may I advise you acquire a Public PGP Key so that users can encrypt their addresses for safety.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to give you a thorough review (and I&#039;m sure others would like that also) but a PGP key is something most users require.<br /><br />Your operation seems quite professional, therefore a PGP is the logical next step.<br />I&#039;m interested to read more about your 50% donations.<br /><br />Goodluck guys, hope to receive a sample sometime soon.

				Thanks so much button boy.<br /><br />We are downloading PGP software as we speak and will add it to our vendor profile as soon as we have it working. <br /><br />Our bandwidth is not great.. (took us 2 hours to download 30 meg software. )<br /><br />We will be posting out all samples on tuesday that&nbsp; have been ordered by then and then we will be posting the rest later in the week. <br /><br />Thanks so much for supporting The Dagga Couple. <br /><br />Read more about them at www.daggacouple.co.za<br /><br />We will be setting up a cold storage wallet with which 50% of our profits to go towards helping The Dagga Couple with legal expenses.

The majority of responsible users refuse to purchase from users who aren&#039;t acquainted with or don&#039;t use PGP encryption.<br /><br />I realise you&#039;re doing this at the moment so when you&#039;ve downloaded, installed and set up your PGP please update these threads and your vendor page so we can use it.<br /><br />Thanks again guys. I look forward to sampling your goods&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />PS. As soon as you&#039;ve got the mandatory 50 posts, I suggest starting an official vendor review thread in the &#039;rumour mill&#039; subsection.
