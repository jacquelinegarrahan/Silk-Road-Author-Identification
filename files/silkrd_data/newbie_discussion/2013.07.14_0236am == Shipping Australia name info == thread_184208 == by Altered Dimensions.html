				Hey all<br /><br />So a quick question for anyone out there that has had stuff posted to Australia from overseas (import)<br />with a non real name on the package?<br /><br />Can we get mail from overseas with a fake name on it?<br />Or does it get picked up because that person it not registered at that address?<br /><br />I personally think you can but want to hear if anyone has done this and had success or not?

				Using a fake name is generally a bad idea. Whoever is delivering your mail will recognize a different name to an address they usually deliver to and it seems more suspicious. Plus most vendors on the road do not want you to use a fake name or address.<br /><br />But if you insist on using one try sending a letter of your own with the same info you plan on providing or find someone out of the country willing to.

I did read an article about ASIO intercepting mail from overseas to POI (Person of interest) who have been &#039;red flag&#039; for Suspension of Terrorism in the same article it linked&nbsp; to SR also about overseas mail and how a &#039;big time drug dealer in Victoria was caught by NSW and VIC Customs. It mentioned that both agency&#039;s are aware of the influx of product coming into the country from Germany and the Netherlands in particluar. The Drug dealer was a give up and told authorities everything including amounts and information, the article was quite detailed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184208.msg1358958#msg1358958">Quote from: evetSFree on July 20, 2013, 02:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They can NOT prove it is you that ordered it even if you sign for it.&nbsp; You dont know whats in there until you open it.&nbsp; It could of been some asshole playing a trick on you or something.&nbsp; Act dumb and DONT ever admit anything. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I do agree with you never talk that is the biggest dog act you can do BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO USE ANY REAL INFORMATION AT ALL my reasoning are;<br /><br />When your dealing with the law acting dumb is not going to hold up as a credible argument in any court you need to be smart about this and try to avoid any suspension at all. You have to remember &#039;Be invisible&#039;, Any information that is against your name stays with you for life and if you have had a suspension of a Letter containing drugs sent to your address that was not yours. You might get off that time but next time you wont Thats what starts the beginning of a case authorities will use to build against you. BE SMARTER THEN THEM&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
