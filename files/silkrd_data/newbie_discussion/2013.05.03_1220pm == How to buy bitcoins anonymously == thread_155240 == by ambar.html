				I bought mine from e-bay and had no trouble.obviously its not anonymous but once they go into your wallet and then transferred to Sr,no one should be able to trace that.

				hard to explain to who?<br />once they are in your wallet they are pretty much untraceable.<br />the only record of sale is your paypal account and unless its your partner your trying to hide your spending&#039;s from,I think your pretty much covered.

Also I&#039;m not sure but I don&#039;t think you have to claim bitcoins for tax purposes unless you&#039;re cashing out. Then you can just say you made it through crafty investment if it&#039;s a small sum. Even if you get audited there&#039;s no way to prove them and there&#039;s no way to trace them.

				Don&#039;t buy from ebay, probably the easiest way to get scammed.&nbsp; Best options today are BitInstant straight to bitcoin address or deposited to Mt. Gox for you to trade anonymously.&nbsp; If doing straight to address, probably good to bounce it off a shared blockchain.info address that will tumble the coins to break the transaction connection, SR tumbles the coins before it get to your SR wallet anyway so it&#039;s hard to trace.<br /><br />Otherwise you can link your bank account to one of the main exchanges for easier and cheaper deposits and then just tumble your coins a few times before SR, this is not fully anon but still safe as there&#039;s no way to trace your money if it&#039;s tumbled multiple times.

				You can use Sugar Mama, a vendor on SR, totally legit, do a search and you can find the review forum. I used her services and was very pleased.<br />Also I used Blue Sky Traders, another vendor on SR, great service as well. <br /><br />****PLEASE NOTE***<br />Using one of these vendors requires a certain amount of trust in a complete stranger, they both abide by the rules and if they don&#039;t buyers would unleash backlash. When I made transactions, the first thought was &quot;oh crap, there goes my money&quot; but every time it worked out perfect!! <br />It&#039;s all about the trust and respect, both go a long way.

				If you already have Dwolla set-up which needs your bank account and stuff for funding, just skip bitinstant and get an account at Mt. Gox or CampBx and trade yourself.&nbsp; Going through bitinstant at that point will just charge a fee to do something simple.&nbsp; Only reason to do that if you don&#039;t want to mess with the exchanges or something, but your information would already be out there.&nbsp; If you are using bitinstant, it&#039;s mostly for the cash/moneygram options.<br /><br />

				I agree with Neebor! Localbitcoins.com is great. Just check feedback of seller first and message him before transaction to see if hes currently online. If he is then you can get them in minutes. The quickest Ive had is 2 mins,

				There&#039;s so many ways to do this anonymously. You can do with along with any individual you trust. Although trust becomes the standard issue. <br /><br />For example,I have no issue with a SEPA transfer to me and an exchange at the going rate - perhaps a little commission. MtGox is my only exchange, but if you want your cash exchanged and give me something... anything.. I&#039;d be good with that :) <br /><br />PGP..Encrypt... Encrypt... Encrypt...

				So can someone tell me the whole process in detail on how to purchase with bitinstant. I remember researching a little while back that they require a name and last 4 digits of your social. Is that all they need? Say I were to enter another persons name and social. I then print out something with the order details, go to walmart or wherever and give them the money. Are they going to request ID for verification? Also are there any other ways to stay 100% anonymous to buy, I totally dislike the idea that the government could see that I bought bitcoin, I know bitcoin can be used to purchase and invest in legitimate purposes and they wont know what I do with it but that won&#039;t put my mind at ease. so far I&#039;ve been buying my coin with moneypaks but any fee thats over 10% I just think is too much especially for a regular and i see it as money going down the toilet.

				Buy BTC using cash. Ultimate anonymity.<br /><br />Some BTC vendors will accept cash in the mail. Use a fake name / email, and there is absolutely nothing to link back to you.

				Localbitcoins.com all the way. Here is one guide I found online which explains the process perfectly:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">localbitcoins.com works by you registering an account with your e-mail address (you could use a tormail.org address). You can also enter in your cellphone SMS number, if you want. That allows you to see when your funds have been released by the BTC seller.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve done that and have found someone who will trade with you, you set up a meeting. I suggest a Starbucks close to you two. Upon meeting, cancel the transaction you used to arrange your meeting. Then immediately re-open another, so your trade is at the current market price. Allow the seller to inspect your cash, but don&#039;t hand it over until the transaction is done.<br /><br />He sets the transaction in motion by transferring the BTC to the temporary address associated with your localbitcoins.com account. Then you have to wait for 3 verifications to complete, which takes a half hour (10 minutes per verification). At least that&#039;s what it is for $100. For $1000+, you may have to wait for 5 or 6 verifications. Alternately, if the seller is familiar with the system, they can transfer the BTC beforehand, meet with you, then release the funds once your cash is in hand. No waiting. But that requires trust in the localbitcoins.com system, which won&#039;t be the case if they haven&#039;t used it before.<br /><br />Once the verifications are complete, the funds are available on the localbitcoins.com system, but they must be released before they&#039;re actually in your account. The seller must release the funds, at which point you&#039;ll receive a text message from the localbitcoins.com system that the transaction has been completed, which includes a verification code. Or, if you opt out of using your cell, you can just check the blockchain that the BTC has been transferred to your localbitcoins.com temporary address, and view your localbitcoins.com account as well to eyeball your balance. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend going through the system and paying the miniscule system transaction fee of 1%, then leaving feedback for the seller and having him do the same with you. This is a service that, just like Ebay, is only as valuable as the feedback and the actual participation in the system. Plus, you get to meet some very cool people by doing it this way, rather than through a faceless- and trackable- bank transfer. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Remember, anything done through the traditional financial system is trackable and traceable. Cash and carry in the only way to do it right. Establish good relationships with a few local BTC traders in your area and you&#039;re golden.
