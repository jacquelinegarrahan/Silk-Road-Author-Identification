				Been browsing SR for a couple of weeks. I have downloaded GNU I guess so I can receive and sent encrypted messages. Still haven&#039;t got that figured out. Then I have to take on the buying of BC&#039;s. Figure out where to create a wallet and be able to finish a purchase. I guess I need some sort of Purchasing On SR For Dummies book. I want to do this all right to protect myself, the sellers and the site. There is alot of information here already, but hard to sort through. Is there a post that can guide the newborn through the process?

				don&#039;t worry about protecting vendors or the site, while that is a nice sentiment, until you understand more about what&#039;s going on you only should worry about covering your own ass.&nbsp; vendors and the site aren&#039;t and shouldn&#039;t be relying on you to keep them safe.

				Thank you for taking the time to reply. Thanks for the link Libertas. Since the politicians will never concede to the failure of the war on drugs (to much money in it)&nbsp; and doctors now see all patients seeking pain relief as suspicious criminals, as a disabled person seeking relief for chronic acute pain,&nbsp; I want to do everything I can to insure that options like the SR will continue to exist. I&#039;m very serous about this and hope that everyone else here feels the same whether they are here for recreation or if like me sick of pill counts.&nbsp;
