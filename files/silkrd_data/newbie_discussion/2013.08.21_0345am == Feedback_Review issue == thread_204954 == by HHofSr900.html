				I am new to the forums but not new to the scene. I usually just troll as I am not too interested in talking. I just read to stay up on info and as much ahead of LE as possible. <br />Anyway I have had a good run with SR and the likes. I have a great deal of good interactions with the vendors here so far. Some smoother than others for sure but all came through so far. <br />&nbsp;My main concern here is the review process. It 99% of cases when a review is left. it usually contains non important things like &quot;FEed early&quot; or &quot;So and SO is the man&quot;. WHO CARES!!!!!! These are not useful to the pending clients. Reviews should be for actual review!!!! Dont just give a 5 of 5 just because your package was lucky enough to make it to your door. I have received stuff that had no stealth at all from TOP vendors. I cant give details because&nbsp; &quot;I GET IT&quot;!! But I have received stuff that if it were snagged in a sorting machie would have for sure failed and cost vendor and I a lot of LIFE CHANGING trouble. So I attempt to switch vendors. I place an order with a &quot;noob&#039; vendor today. He says &quot;cool&quot; I process your order ASAP&quot;. Then two hours later (after he realizes he has too much money locked in escrow to do the drop shipped order of mine) he sends ME a snotty message. Turns out. Not only does he have postings he cant honor because he has no funds except the &quot;escrowed amounts&quot;. But he is punishing me by &quot;banning me form his sales&quot; because I left an honest review. Not a mean one. Not an attack. But a review containing honest feedback and review material. Thats it. I as a daily user of SR am sick of the games of these vendors at times. Some are here to do business. Some are not ready to do business. Eg: tigerrush. I know this will rage a few vendors. But sometimes I wish that a vendor could not post a product for a given amount that he cant match with his own funds. Why should we FE just to float your vendor account? Why should we be treated like bad patrons when it is you that are unprepared for the listings you so happily post. IF YOU CANT FLOAT THE PURCHASE TO YOUR CHINA VENDOR? THEN WHAT GOOD ARE YOU? WHY GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE AND SR A PERCENTAGE IF YOU CANT EVEN MIDDLE MAN PROPERLY? WHY WOULD IT BE THE FAULT OF THE BUYER THAT YOU &quot;THE VENDOR&quot; CANT DO BUSINESS MATH?&nbsp; All too many vendors are in the habit of demanding FE (against policy I might add) or pressuring you to FE (again against policy I might add). And when you write a review lets not forget that these assholes have your personal info and have shown childish behaviors in the daily business already. SO WHAT IS A SERIOUS BUYER TO DO? Where does one get a vendor who ACTUALLY WANTS TO REMAIN FREE BY USING STEALTH, PGP ENCRYTION, AND HAS THE WEIGHT AND FLOW TO ACTUALLY DO BUSINESS? <br /><br />Whew! End rant. Love ya SilkRoaders.
