				just want to get everyone&#039;s thoughts on the best ways to keep your gear fresh and as potent as possible for as long as possible.<br /><br />Basically, I keep all my stash - mdma, speed, coke, ketamine and xanax powder, all in their respective baggies - in an air-tight jar with one of those silica gel packets in there.<br /><br />Anyone have any thoughts on this? Any problems with my method?

				Well as for Marijuana, some freeze it. But freezing can lead to less potency, so your best bet is too keep it in a cool, dark place. A jar with silica packs works perfect, its the temp and light/humidity that fuck with it mostly.

				Powders are thrown into glass vials straight away. They are kept in an air tight container, container in a nice dark and always cool place.<br /><br />Best place you can store your powders is underground. Will last a lifetime-MDMA/MDA. Not too sure about cocaine though, if in brick/rock form, i really don&#039;t see why not.<br /><br />Weed i store in air tight glass jars, also for curing of course, but they last for a long time once cured and air tight.<br /><br />

				sweet. thanks for the replies.<br /><br />i will add, as well as keeping it all in an airtight jar with a silica packet in there, i also keep that jar in a wooden box, which is inside another kind of kind of insulated wooden box (gotta keep it a secret stash)<br /><br />so the light issue is not an definitely not a problem. <br /><br />maybe if anything heat would be an issue? or maybe not, i dont know.

				The easiest way to keep your stash fresh is to use that shit fast so you don&#039;t have to worry about it, you could even leave it dry-baking, guaranteed freshness.<br /><br /><br />Tbh, I don&#039;t really mind the freshness, unless it&#039;s something that loses potency when it gets stale. I make sure my shit is hidden good in case anything happens, and I use a regular zip lock bag and squeeze the air out, nothing special. I would think that room temperature out of the sun would be the best way to keep everything fresh though.<br /><br />

				I just use an old tea container out of the sun and keep powders in their baggies. For weed, 420science sells these awesome glass jars which&#039;ll keep it sticky for a solid month and pretty good for up to four or five months. Cute designs too, and I&#039;ve had them fall out of my bag onto asphalt when I&#039;m biking and it was hardly scratched. The smallest jars fit an eighth nicely.<br /><br />Tabs are the hardest I think... I fold them so that the print touches (so if it leaks it just likes into itself) and then wrap them in paper and then plastic, put them in a DVD case and keep them refrigerated. It seems to work pretty well.
