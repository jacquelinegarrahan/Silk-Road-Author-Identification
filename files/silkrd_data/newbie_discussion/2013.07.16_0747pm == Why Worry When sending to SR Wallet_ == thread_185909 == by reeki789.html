				Ok so i&#039;ve heard a lot of people say not to send coins directly into your SR wallet, and that you should send them to multiple wallets first..<br /><br />Obviously with sites charging transaction fees this can be costly...<br /><br />Please explain to me why it&#039;s not a good idea to send directly from a site you bought the coins at like mt.gox to SR... I&#039;ve been doing it for a year now with no issue but always want to be safe.

				Pretty sure it&#039;ll be fine if you change your bitcoin address on your SR account every now and then

				Am I being paranoid?<br />I buy thru Bitinstant.com under my real name accessed through regular browser.<br />I direct Bitinstant to send to an online wallet accessed with regular browser.<br />I then transfer the funds paying extra for a shared send to a second anonymous wallet that I access only via Tor.<br />Then I pay extra to do another shared send to Silk Road in the amount I need for my purchase.<br />Is that overkill? Is there a better way?

				Off topic perhaps, but I thought I would mention that I also throw my eventual delivery into the trash with other junk mail for a day or two thinking that might help if LE came with a warrant.

				When considering the benefit of tumbling out of SR you has to critically examine the concept of tumbling and the various networks that provide such services.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To speed it up .... The potential risk of tumbling through SR is having a powerful enemy recognize network address consistencies and then be able to identify individuals buying their currencies due to being transmitted directly to the network.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You are almost certainly right .... but some people will want the added security of a using network less analyzed (perhaps) to tumble the coins first.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There are several methods of greater complexity... but maybe just start with any 3rd party tumbler

				I think tumbling the coins before sending them to SR is the best bet. You can use bitcoinfog<br /><br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried this myself yet though.

				Here&#039;s the description of their service<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The standard procedure to anonymize Bitcoins is to make a deposit at the deposit page, and after some time request a withdrawal<br /><br />Your Bitcoins are mixed in our internal pool with other users&#039; Bitcoins and then get paid back to your new address or multiple addresses in a number of randomized amounts at randomized times, thus making it highly unlikely to trace the origin of your bitcoins and definitely making it impossible to prove.<br /><br />We make your bitcoins truly anonymous!<br /><br />The service currently only takes between 1% and 3% fee on all deposits. The fee is randomized for each deposit to further obscure linking money going into and out of the Fog.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Will this clean the process &quot;enough&quot;?<br /><br />Buy into a SR account, &quot;changing the address often&quot;.<br />Sending to different SR Accounts, changing addresses often again.<br /><br />Every session using a new identify on tor.<br /><br />Curious, let me know!<br /><br />B

				You should never send bitcoins from an online wallet to SR.&nbsp; Any site can trace a transfer going from them to a tor based wallet and would rouse suspicion.&nbsp; <br /><br />
