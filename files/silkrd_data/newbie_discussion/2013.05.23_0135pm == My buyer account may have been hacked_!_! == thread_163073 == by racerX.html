				I&#039;ve tried logging into my buyer&#039;s account and cannot gain access. I was just on 1-1/2 weeks ago after the DDoS attack(or whatever attack used on SR) and everything was fine. I had a significant amount of money with that user name and now I&#039;m afraid I have nothing due to me not be able to log on-the inevitable.<br /><br />Is there any Admin/Mod that can help me gain access or point me into the right direction? Thank you

				Your account has not been hacked unless your password and PIN were both incredibly weak.&nbsp; Otherwise, it&#039;s more likely that you visited a phishing site and entered your password and PIN.&nbsp; SR will never ask for your PIN at login.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is the one and only url you should be using:&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />At this point, you need to create a new account and message SR Support from there with the last btc address you deposited to, the amount, and any other info that can help prove the account in question belongs to you.

				Thanks Scout! Actually, it was a phishing site, but I didn&#039;t enter my PIN-which is weird because it would ask for that, but I guess I&#039;ll know when I get a response back from SR support and I log back on. So, I should be good as far as my BTC still being there(a significant amount). I think they would try burning the PIN# attempts and wait the 5-7days to get a new PIN# and hope I don&#039;t catch it. <br /><br />By the way, I used the SR.onion.to url to log in. I cross checked this while I was logged on to SR and opened a separate window and typed the SR.onion.to url addy and it was indeed a different site. Time will tell, but if someone can respond quickly to my concern/questions from SR support then I should be fine(I hope, fingers crossed).<br /><br />Any info Scout? BTW, I&#039;m a veteran member. I created a new forum account to conceal identity.

				You should NOT be using the onion.to proxy.&nbsp; It exists to allow access to .onion sites without using Tor ... so whoever runs the onion.to proxy has access to your IP and activity associated with it here.&nbsp; You should never use onion.to ... you should be using Tor!

				I don&#039;t know. It was always something I did because that was how I was told to use it by a friend. I guess the is out of my scope understanding. Silly me, I guess I need to research more.<br /><br />Anyhow, so what is the deal with the SR.onion.to url since it is different than the onion/ url? Is it a confirmed phishing site? Thanks Scout

However, they have access to your real IP address and have the potential to log any of your details that you enter by using a keylogger / datalogger.<br /><br />Use the Tor Browser Bundle, and ONLY visit silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />Libertas
