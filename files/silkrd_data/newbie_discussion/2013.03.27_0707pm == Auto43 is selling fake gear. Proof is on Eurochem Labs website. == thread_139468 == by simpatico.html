				I have been on SR for quite a while.&nbsp; I have done 50 transactions and spent over $4400 dollars on products with a refund rate of 0.04%.&nbsp; I am a legitimate buyer who appreciates legitimate vendors and their products, but due to my lack of diligence, I was recently scammed by Auto43.&nbsp; I checked www.eurochemlabs.com and found the information below on their vials and how to spot the fakes.&nbsp; Clearly, the products I received are counterfeit as they are 5.5 to 6cm in height, the labels do not have diagonal strips, and the holograms are generic and do not look anything like what EC labs actually uses.&nbsp; Below is the info taken directly from their site.<br /><br />Here you will see how to recognize if the product is original or fake. There are some basic features that allow to see if the product is legit:<br /><br /><br />VIALS Basic feature of our injectable products is shape of vial. 10ml vials are special type and it is very hard to get them for counterfeiters. You can just measure the overall height of the vial (with top), it must be 5cm (1.97 in), no higher. Ussually fake vials are 5.5 cm - 6 cm (2.16 in - 2.36 in).<br /><br />We have not seen fake 5ml vials, cause these vials are also very hard to get and counterfeiters prefer 10ml. So, we can say that all 5ml vials must be real.<br /><br />Please, pay attention to the difference between the necks of the vials: the fake one has shorter and more rounded neck than the original vial.<br /><br />Attention: New labels!<br /><br />Starting from 2009 we&nbsp; produce injectables with diagonal strips on labels. At present moment there are NO vials with old labels left on the market. If the label does not have diagonal strips on it - the product is definitely FAKE.<br /><br /><br />Attention: 5 and 10 ml vials now have new label design with diagonal the convex strips on it.<br /><br /><br />I wish I was on the forums more so I could have posted this in the Rumor Mill.&nbsp; I hope someone who reads it can copy the info over to there.<br /><br />Bottom line - Auto43 is selling fake gear.&nbsp; Do not buy from him.<br />
