				So many scammers having a whale of a time, silkroad is a con.<br /><br />The over inflated prices, volatile bitcoin rate, your order never gets sent you lose your money, it&#039;s gets cancelled you lose your money.<br /><br />I even suspect silkroad admins to be in on scamming buyers, going in the sellers favour in a dispute and faking feedback comments.<br /><br />People are losing hundreds which is just insanity, and told to just &#039;take it on the chin&#039;, these people must have far more money than brain cells in their head.<br /><br />Want some advice GET OUT, GET OUT NOW !&nbsp; Don&#039;t be one of those suckers crying in the general discussion cause they lost all their money....be smater than them.<br /><br />Silkroad is for the sellers to scam you and for the silkroad admins to assist so they can get rich, it&#039;s all a big con.

				Nothing&#039;s perfect, and there will always be scammers.<br /><br />As long as you know what you&#039;re doing, research who you&#039;re buying from, and don&#039;t gamble with more than you can afford to lose then you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been here over a year and have only been scammed once. And even that was avoidable and obvious now I think about it.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t use it. Simple

				Well every transaction I&#039;ve taken part in SR has worked out perfectly. Yes I pay a little more on SR but so far for the consistent quality, weight, convenience and security provided by not have to deal on the street or even an in house contact (just missed getting picked up in a major bust a few times with in house contacts and these days there is so much more potential violence one may encounter) that I&#039;m more than happy to pay a bit of a premium price on SR.

				I&#039;ve generally had good experiences ordering for over a year now.&nbsp; Sometimes it doesn&#039;t work and usually the vendor gives a full refund.&nbsp; On the offchance&nbsp; a vendor isn&#039;t respond then SR always has given a fair resolution.

The fact us humble customers even have the option of utilizing a site such as Silk Road and have the opportunity to have access to substances we may never had had before is revolutionary. Despite that, all the hard work the site admins and the reputable sellers must have to go through to make sure that everything runs (relatively) smoothly, we should be thankful. If you have had even remote experience in the &quot;black market&quot; you would know there is always the possibility of being scammed, etc. Silk Road represents a contemporary alternative that reduces these risks, as long as you do your research and have more then two or three brain cells, you will find Silk Road a positive, communal space.

				There are plenty of good sellers on SR. But you are dealing with drug dealers and the best sellers will go rogue at any time so find a few good sellers that sell the same thing and stick to them so that when one drops off you report that person(never FE) and move on to the next good seller that is on your bookmarked list. I have had many good purchases and I&#039;ve been screwed a few times also. Being a noob doesn&#039;t help as you are prey and vendors will let you have it when you make stupid mistakes like FE early. Anyway, SR is great. USE PGP OR PRIVNOTE FOR ALL MESSAGES AND DON&#039;T FE, DON&#039;T STASH SHIT WHERE YOU LIVE OR USE A STASH SAFE(hidden safe,can, or some shit) AND DON&#039;T SIGN FOR PACKAGES THAT COME FROM ADDRESSES YOU DON&#039;T KNOW.&nbsp; Life will go one and everyone will be ok.
