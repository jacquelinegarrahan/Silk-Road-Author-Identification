				I dont wanna cause alarm but I purchased some &quot;drugs&quot; off a major vendor here on SR and when it arrived I inspected it and it didn&#039;t look right, so i talked to some people they said i should get a toxin test kit.<br /><br />I have performed two tests using a powder test kit on this &quot;drug&quot; it has returned a positive results for RICIN/ANTHRAX .<br /><br />I have sent a information to the staff and dont want to name the drug or vendor incase it was a malicious postal worker

				Also...why the phuck would a vendor send a random dude like you a thing like anthrax??<br />Unless you can prove this lab result, I&#039;m writing you off as LE trying to scare us all.<br />Ha ha ha ha I laugh in the face of danger hahaha!!<br />I would suggest all your newbies (and others) reading this thread, that you just simply trust what no one says unless they prove it--and even then, don&#039;t trust anyone.<br /><br />Prove it, OP...otherwise...cool story bro.

				Yeah, unless you can post some proof of these test results, I&#039;m hesitant to believe that a vendor here sent you anthrax.&nbsp; :\<br /><br />And if the vendor DID send you anthrax and you DO have proof, then you need to name the vendor here immediately so others know to test the orders they receive from said vendor.
