				I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with CoinXchange.&nbsp; But they are always in stealth mode so I&#039;m not sure if you can see them if you aren&#039;t a current customer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used moneyhoney once or twice I believe.. they def have a good rep (at least last I checked) and have been around for a while.&nbsp; Coin vendors come and go unfortunately.&nbsp; And it&#039;s always a mission keeping on top of who is good.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get too over confident tho.. buying coins on this site is super risky.&nbsp; I only do small amounts and luckily have never been ripped off.&nbsp; Done it probably 10-15 times.&nbsp; If you DO get ripped off tho.. the website can&#039;t get you your money back.

				Thanks for the reply.<br />I am not necessarily going to be your competition. Although it does sound a bit lucrative! But how do you sell coins for coins? When the coins exchange fluctuates and deflates?

				I get 10% off the top , and I stay at the computer working and hussling between here and LBC&nbsp; so the coin flux might get me a lil or I could get a lil bonus. Either way I figure by the end of the year it will balance out between win / loss because of the flux in coin

				So the 10% is basically what you earn? I checked out your vendor page to try and get a better understanding. Seems like an interesting thing to do? If you don&#039;t mind about how many coins do you move consistently?

				Blue Sky Traders<br /><br />They are not a SR vendor, but their info is available via the Tor search engine. <br /><br />Simply e-mail them at: bitcoinage@jdpowell.net and let them know how much you wish to purchase. <br /><br />They will send you a reply with instructions, either a cash deposit at your local Bank of America, or you can send them cash in the mail.<br /><br />They are true professionals.&nbsp; Coins to your account within a few hours unless they have sold out, in which case you are in line for the next trading day.<br /><br />No worries with these guys.<br />
