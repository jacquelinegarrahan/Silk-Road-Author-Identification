				So I just signed up with a new account because I don&#039;t want the return shipping info on the package linked back to my main SR/Forum account. Then I forgot I can only post in newbie section.. FML :(<br /><br />Back to business. I am selling my batch-1 Avalon ASIC. This is in my possession and is hashing away we speak! IT IS NOT A PRE-ORDER!<br />It is hashing at 64gh/s on BTCguild pool, I make approx 3.5BTC/day with the current difficulty.<br /><br />As most of you know these know these now go from anywhere between from $10,000 - $40,000. In all honesty that price is is absurd!!<br />The unit is approx 2 weeks old,&nbsp; running the latest firmware and working perfectly. I do recommend rebooting it every few days for good measure.<br /><br />I was going to sell the unit on Ebay but unfortunately I can&#039;t take the chargeback risk of paypal, so I have had to turn to the dark side LOL.<br /><br />The unit is currently hashing away in a data centre in NYC (free power at work FTW!)&nbsp; but it can be shipped anywhere in the world and will be insured and have tracking. You can even chose the courier as I know some countries have issues with some couriers. Its a heavy unit about 34-40kg I think but the price will include shipping and insurance. <br /><br />I am only selling it because I now have a baby on the way (well the missus does.. but it&#039;s mine.. she tells me haha)&nbsp; and unfortunately doctors and schools don&#039;t accept BTC, yet. Selling coins every couple of days is now a bit of a hassle for me as bitfloor has closed down. <br /><br />It is for sale for 80 BTC.&nbsp; I will require 40BTC upfront and the following 40BTC when you receive the unit. If you can trust me, I can trust you that you will send the second half of the payment when<br />you receive the unit.. and if not.. I will come after you :ninja: <br /><br />At the current difficulty you will make the 80BTC back in less than a month.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to ask ay questions<br /><br />Tim

				I considered making a vendor account but their was no point man. I am still going to ask people to F.E. <br />Its as easy for buyers to scam as it is for Vendors.<br /><br />SR Admins do a great job, sometimes; however I can&#039;t take the risk for an item that is essentially worth $40,000 depending on how greedy I want to be&nbsp; :D

				Sorry I did not know. Feel free to lock this thread.<br /><br />I guess I can mine for an extra 1.5 days and cough up the 5BTC for a vendor account&nbsp; ;D
