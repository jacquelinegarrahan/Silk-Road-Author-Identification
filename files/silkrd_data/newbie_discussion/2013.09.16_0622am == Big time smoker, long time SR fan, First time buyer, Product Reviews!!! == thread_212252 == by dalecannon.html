				I have a grow setup myself that has been running flawlessly for the past ~9 years.&nbsp; Never needed bud and make my own very potent butter.&nbsp; This summer my grow was hit by broadmites (nasty microscopic fuckers) that ruined my crop flowering and everything in veg/mother plants.<br /><br />I freaked out, i bleached my grow room and got new seeds and finally am back at it(about to pull my first clones of sour bubble and sour boggle).&nbsp; Problem i saw myself facing a few weeks back was im going to run out of bud as i stated in title i am a very heavy smoker (3-9 grams aday) all depends.&nbsp; So found the best way to get bitcoins anonymously and finally made my first purchase! actually another since it was so easy!<br /><br />I have the following coming: 2 grams of Gods Gift BHO Wax, 2 grams of Dutch Treat BHO Wax, and 2ml/or 2 grams of OG Kush c02 Hash Oil coming from Just4u2nv.&nbsp; Will give a very in depth review with pics when received.<br />also got 100 2mg xanax bars from Xanax king.&nbsp; I love having some on hand when i get stressed and my docs 5 at a time doesn&#039;t do it for me! So again will give a review of well if i get them or not and how fast.&nbsp; i mean xanax bars and xanax bars right?<br /><br />anyways wish me luck guys and gals!&nbsp; i do want to purchase 1 oz of bubble hash from tweetb, but i don&#039;t wanna buy do much at once.&nbsp; As long as the wax and oil comes ill be fine!!!!

				Well i could not of had a better experience with my first time purchase.&nbsp; I mean also in general lol was as smooth as buying a cpu on amazon.&nbsp; I did my research and am very happy with Just4u2nv&#039;s Wax and oil along with Xanax Kings&#039; you guessed it Xanax!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Ordered both orders on a Sunday afternoon both packages came on the following wednesday along with some other legit things i ordered.&nbsp; Great stealth on both vendors, actually laughed when i opened Xanax Kings.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait for my next purchase has anyone had experience with tweetb&#039;s bubble hash.<br /><br />The wax i received is very high quality and you can tell purged very well after smoking. The wax is purged very very well, have not seen any sparking just pure amazing smoke when it hits my domeless ti nail on my dab rig.&nbsp; I did just a few dabs of the Gods Gift and i am legit stoned and it takes a lot for me to get stoned aside from the first big smoke of the day.&nbsp; Personally i like the gods gift more then the dutch treat.&nbsp; Just prefer the taste and high.&nbsp; I have not tried the oil yet but i will during my next session and report back with a review.<br /><br />The Xanax is as expected 2 mg bars and are legit, nothing else to say aside from im having a great day off, melted and ripped now and ready to play some GTA V.<br /><br />
