				What a wonderful advertisement these numbers would make for Silk Road.&nbsp; &quot;Come be one of the chosen few... who have been raped in prison.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; :-X<br /><br />My sincere apologies to those who have been: I don&#039;t mean anything by it; I just make light of everything.&nbsp; Life is unbearable otherwise.&nbsp; It&#039;s striking that of 12 people, only 28% have avoided any of these terrible things.&nbsp; Why the fuck do we do drugs again...?<br /><br />That&#039;s rhetorical.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t answer with &quot;to forget about the terrible things.&quot;&nbsp; ::)

				I voted none of the above, but I have a suggestion for another interesting option.. How many have died?? I died a few months ago, yup, I should change my username to Nosferatu, I&#039;m pretty sure it means &quot;not dead&quot; or &quot;undead&quot;.
