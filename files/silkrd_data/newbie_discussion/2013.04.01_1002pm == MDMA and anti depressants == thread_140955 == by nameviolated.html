				I&#039;m currently prescribed anti depressants and anti psychotics and have no luck with LSD working.&nbsp; Will this also be the case with MDMA?

				I know MDMA won&#039;t work when on SSRI based AD&#039;s and can be quite dangerous too.

				What antidepressants are you taking? Completely depends on what you&#039;re taking and also why you are taking them doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />drugsforum is a great place to ask questions like this.|

				Taking MDMA causes your brain to be flooded with Serotonin<br />Taking SSRIs prevents your brain from &quot;taking back&quot; the Serotonin<br /><br />So basically if you take MDMA with an SSRI you&#039;re risking giving yourself serotonin syndrome<br /><br />So don&#039;t do it. Stop taking your SSRIs for a couple of months and then you should be ok.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about how MDMA reacts with MAOIs but I would still be cautious.

				Thanks for the info, I just checked and it&#039;s not a SSRI but an SNRI, not sure what the difference is but will research it further.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had MDMA before and didn&#039;t get much from it, though it probably wasn&#039;t the best.

				Find out how long it takes for your meds to become completely eliminated from your system.<br />Drugs.com is a fantastic resource for info like this. My advice, stick to weed for the time being or until your doc takes you off at least on of those meds.

				I would suggest doing a huge amount of research before you even consider it. After you&#039;ve done the research I would suggest doing a lot of soul searching. If your being prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, you clearly have some emotional/mental issues troubling you. MDMA is a chemical that dramatically effects your brain chemistry. I would be very cautious with &quot;mixing&quot; multiple drugs that alter your brain chemistry when you are already having issues with balancing. If you want to try some sort of &quot;drug&quot; to assist you with your struggle, I would suggest looking into ibogaine. It would take a significant amount of research, time, and thought but it might be worth it for you. Ibogaine is a chemical that has shown huge results in helping people battling with emotional issues. The majority of attention is focused on it&#039;s use for opiate rehab, but it does a lot of miraculous things for people battling depression, anxiety, etc. Ibogaine is not a &quot;party&quot; drug like MDMA, it is more of a soul searching drug that helps you work through deep rooted emotional issues.

				Thanks again for the replies, did some research yesterday and found that MDMA doesn&#039;t work with Pristiq.&nbsp; Will have to stick to meth and coke I guess.

				I have done this without knowing the consequences...<br /><br />I am on 100mg Sertraline(SSRI) a day and popped 3 Nintendo&#039;s(600mg MDMA). I felt nothing only stay awake a bit longer and then come down on a Zopiclone.<br /><br />So SSRI&#039;s and SRNI&#039;s dont work with XTC and LSD.
