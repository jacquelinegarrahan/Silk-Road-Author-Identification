				We are a team of doctors with a lot of spare pharmaceuticals on hand.&nbsp; we&#039;re not looking to beat anyone out of their game, its just...we have a lot and get it for cheap...so why not sell it cheap?<br /><br />Looking if there is any interest on the road for the stuff we have;&nbsp; Pretty much seeing if its worth it to spend the seller&#039;s amount before buying it.<br /><br />We have a lot to offer and also take requests (if what we listed is not there because, afterall, we DO work at the hospital and anything is possible.)<br /><br />At the Moment, we were looking to see if there was any interest in....<br /><br />mainly...<br /><br />~Ketamine (vials, 10mL)<br /><br />~Alprazolam (tablets, .25/.5/1/1.5mg) comes in packs of x10-x100<br /><br />~Morphine (ampule, 2mL)<br /><br />~Naloxone (Narcan---really important even if you dont think you /your friends will overdose..if you do heroin its a strong possibility..best to be safe, no?) <br /><br />~<br /><br />we also have/can get<br />diazapam<br /><br />lorazapam<br /><br />Clonazapam<br /><br />Modafinil<br /><br />Tramadol<br /><br />gabapentin<br /><br />haloperidol<br /><br />clozapine<br /><br />cough syrups with codeine or dextromethorphan<br /><br /><br />request&nbsp; away if you can&#039;t see what you want.&nbsp; We have access to pretty much everything...<br /><br /><br />I used to have an account on here but forgot the password...which is kinda a bummer because of the 50posts rule and all.<br /><br />SO i suppose a &quot;Hello!!&quot; is in order :)

				and we&#039;re willing to send free samples of certain things if this does spark interest, because how can you gauge a product&#039;s quality just by a picture or a description we say?<br /><br />We stand behind it..because its what we give to our patients and its what we would want to be given to us if needed, so no dealing with any bullshit fake/knock off rif raff.<br /><br />Although I have heard that indian alprozolams, for example, some have said aren&#039;t as &quot;strong&quot;; well i invite you to take a try at ours and see what its about. I personally enjoyed it. and I&#039;ve had the bars you get in america (specifically ca) those 4 piece bars.<br /><br /><br />And this is all to see if there is actually any interest or are we just another cow in the big overcrowded drug herd, sort to speak/
