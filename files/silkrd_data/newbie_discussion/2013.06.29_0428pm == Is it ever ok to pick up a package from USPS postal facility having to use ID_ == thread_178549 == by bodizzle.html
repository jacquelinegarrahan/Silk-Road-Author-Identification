				Is this *ALWAYS* a big no no? Or is there exceptions? <br /><br />I ask this in the case the delivery guy might miss a drop off etc..<br /><br />*was wondering also, how does the whole &quot;karma&quot; system in our profiles work? (I have -1 and I have no idea why)

				Is this just a dumb question to which the answer is obvious?<br /><br />Would really like to know if this is always strongly reccommended against under all circumstances?

				Well a post office cant legaly take contraban into there facility. But i think it would be sketch to show an ID. I use a po box so that its safer than a house in my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />The karma thing works by a full member/one with100+ post clicks +1 or -1 right below your name dont know much more than that.

				Well it&#039;s okay if they can&#039;t take contraband into a post office... It&#039;s not sketchy to show an ID because it&#039;s what normal people do :P I wouldn&#039;t want to lose a package just because I don&#039;t want to show an ID.

Isnt that always the big no no? <br /><br />Nope, havent received my express order. No deliveries on sunday so monday will be 5 days for a USPS domestic express&nbsp; &gt;:( That is if it even comes then....... The vendor did, thankfully, get back to me yesterday to tell me the package was still &quot;in transit&quot; when he checked the tracking number..
