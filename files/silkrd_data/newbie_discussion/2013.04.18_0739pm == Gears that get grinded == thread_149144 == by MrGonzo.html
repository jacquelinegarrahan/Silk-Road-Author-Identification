No the fact that you think you do shows that you don&#039;t<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Thanks for agreeing <br /><br />P.S. Instead of making assumptions think more deeply...<br /><br />5. Bitch ass mo-fuckers making assumptions<br /><br />6. Bitch ass niggas that don&#039;t realize this is a playful post meant to get my post count up and lack the ability to contribute...

With that comment about you understanding every aspect of reality and all. I&#039;m sorry for calling names in a playful manner. I realize my behavior is detrimental to others mental capabilities. I will cease all name calling from this point on. Can i have some more tips from you dude?
