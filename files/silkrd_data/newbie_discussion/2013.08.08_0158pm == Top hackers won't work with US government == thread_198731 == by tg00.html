				Yeah I agree with you on that one...the U.S. government feels is it is necessary to police the world when in all honesty...they don&#039;t....Just like local LEO, they go through a power-trip as soon as the uniform and badge are put on...in the cases of the U.S. government, as soon as the suit is put on...the power trip begins. I don&#039;t like it as much as the next person, but when push comes to shove, the U.S. government is skating on thin ice with the true patriots of the nation...it&#039;s only a matter of time before the U.S. government does something really sideways to its citizens to really push them over the edge....but in the mean time, I&#039;m gonna enjoy everything that life has to offer, smoke a spliff and chill on the beach!<br /><br /><br />Mr.Black

				As an American, I love my country, But i HATE the government.<br /><br />The federal government is nothing more than a criminal/terrorist organization that is out of control and just doing what it wants when it wants to whomever it wants.<br /><br />It no longer represents the American people and thus it needs to be abolished.

He became active in Texas politics and served as an advisor to President Woodrow Wilson, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson&#039;s chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917-1919), and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference. He died on March 28, 1938 in New York City.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward and his father had friends in the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; The Klan dispensed vigilante justice after the Civil War.&nbsp; In 1880 a new legitimate group was in charge of dispensing justice in Texas -- the Texas Rangers.&nbsp; Many of the Texas Rangers were members of the Klan. Edward was the new master.&nbsp; Edward gained their loyalty by stroking their egos.&nbsp; Edward would use his money and influence to try and make them famous.&nbsp; Edward eventually inherited the Texas Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward Mandell House helped to make four men governor of Texas: James S. Hogg (1892), Charles A. Culberson (1894), Joseph D. Sayers (1898), and S. W.T. Lanham (1902).&nbsp; After the election House acted as unofficial advisor to each governor.&nbsp; Hogg gave House the title &quot;Colonel&quot; by promoting House to his staff.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward wanted to control more than Texas, Edward wanted to control the country. Edward would do so by becoming a king maker instead of a king. Edward knew that if he could control two or three men in the Senate, two or three men in the House; and the President, he could control the country.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward would influence the candidate from behind the scenes. The people would perceive one man was representing them, when in reality; an entirely different man was in control.&nbsp; House didn&#039;t need to influence millions of people; he need only influence a handful of men.&nbsp; Edward would help establish a secret society in America that would operate in the same fashion -- the Council on Foreign Relations.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward Mandell House was instrumental in getting Woodrow Wilson elected as President.&nbsp; Edward had the support of William Jennings Bryan and the financial backing of the House of Rockefeller&#039;s National City Bank.&nbsp; Edward became Wilson&#039;s closest unofficial advisor.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward Mandell House and some of his schoolmates were also members of Cecil Rhodes Round Table group.&nbsp; The Round Table Group, the back bone of the Secret Society, had four pet projects, a graduated income tax, a central bank, creation of a Central Intelligence Agency, and the League of Nations.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Between 1901 and 1913 the House of Morgan and the House of Rockefeller formed close alliances with the Dukes and the Mellons. This group consolidated their power and came to dominate other Wall Street powers including: Carnegie, Whitney, Vanderbilt, Brown-Harriman, and Dillon-Reed. The Round Table Group wanted to control the people by having the government tax people and deposit the peoples money in a central bank. The Group would take control of the bank and therefore have control of the money. The Group would take control of the State Department and formulate government policy, which would determine how the money was spent. The Group would control the CIA which would gather information about people, and script and produce psycho-political operations focused at the people to influence them to act in accord with Round Table Group State Department policy decisions. The Group would work to consolidate all the nations of the world into a single nation, with a single central bank under their control, and a single International Security System.&nbsp; Some of the first legislation of the Wilson Administration was the institution of the graduated income tax (1913) and the creation of a central bank called the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; An inheritance tax was also instituted. These tax laws were used to rationalize the need for legislation that allowed the establishment of tax-exempt foundations.&nbsp; The tax-exempt foundations became the link between the Groupmember&#039;s private corporations and the University system. The Group would control the Universities by controlling the sources of their funding. The funding was money sheltered from taxes being channeled in ways which would help achieve Round Table Group aims.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Edward Mandell House had this to say in a private meeting with President Woodrow Wilson:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging.&nbsp; By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register or suffer being unable to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent,&nbsp; &nbsp;forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call&nbsp; “Social Insurance.” Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.”<br />
