				This is my 1st post, no messing about getting straight to the point!<br /><br />Looking for ways/ideas on how to smuggle product internally?<br /><br />I&#039;m going on holiday and would like to take some product for personal use with me.<br /><br />Don&#039;t want advice on alternative options thanks. <br /><br />Anyone know the best/safest ways to swallow?<br /><br />Been reading about using condoms, double wrapping then using oil or maple syrup to help swallow it.<br /><br />Also heard best to take pain killers or throat sprays to numb the throat before swallowing.<br /><br />Ideas of best way to do it e.g. use cling film/plastic to wrap it up, what condoms, anything better than these to wrap it, how much powder to put into each pellet.<br /><br />What would be needed before and after. After easy, presume just a laxative to help &quot;release&quot; it all, but something to stop you shitting it out before you want it to?<br /><br />Any genuine ideas/experience appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Torn1<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have any personal experience with this, but I think a condom is going to dissolve in your stomach acid and you are going to ingest ALL of the drugs you are trying to smuggle at once.&nbsp; Plastic wrap is just going to loose its cling in all that liquid and again, release all the drugs into your system.&nbsp; Man up and keister it, a condom or balloon will work in that situation. But as you said you don&#039;t want alternative options so I&#039;ll shut up now.

				Depends on what gender you are on, how long the flight is going to be, etc.&nbsp; For instance if you are going overseas, that is usually the only time you have to worry about drug dogs.&nbsp; Thought, a friend of mine walked right by some when he came in through customs.&nbsp; <br />He had a couple 50g blocks of hash taped to the inside of his leg.&nbsp; The trick that he found was to bring a portable vac seal, he&#039;d package them up right before the flight, to cut back on permeation problems.&nbsp; Before the flight landed, he went to the bathroom, took the packs off and cut them open.&nbsp; He then put the pocket vac seal back together and resealed them taped them to his legs and off he went.<br /><br />For smaller amounts, domestically.&nbsp; The leg of the trip you will worry about is the initial security check.&nbsp; <br />You just need to pass the pat down, which is accomplished by re-bagging the bud with thick plastic right before the trip and with clean resin free hands. Once you have it freshly sealed, you buy yourself a couple hours before the smell permeates (leaks) through the bag.&nbsp; The naked searches are discontinued as of recent lapse in certification by govt, or so I&#039;ve read on the news.&nbsp; My friend has always opted out, and have passed all pat downs.

				Honestly - don&#039;t get caught up on the throat sprays etc -<br />get a bowl of vegetable oil - saran wrap each one twice.<br />Dip in oil - swallow.<br /><br />If you go through an airport that has body scanners - just simply opt out as you have heard of health risks associated with the radiation.<br />They can&#039;t legally make you do it.<br />If you&#039;re travelling with your family and you haven&#039;t made several trips to this location within a year you&#039;re going to get through no probs. <br />It&#039;s when you visit the same place 6 times in a year for 5 - 7 days that sets off searches and questioning.

				It depends on what you&#039;re trying&nbsp; to smuggle.&nbsp; If its weed I strongly suggest thc capsules I&#039;ve had dogs right next to them crossing multiple borders.
