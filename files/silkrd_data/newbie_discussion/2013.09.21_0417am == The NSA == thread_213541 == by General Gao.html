				OK SR family,<br />After several months of being a customer on SR and meeting many wonderful people, I put this idea to the forums. As we all know, the greatest and most salient threat to the ideals of the SR as well as the very website itself is the National Security Agency. Suppose we were to pick a day, and that day will be SR anti NSA day (which forms a convenient acronym btw: SAND). On this day, all SR users would throw everything they have against the NSA. Use DOS programs to slam its servers. Send all kinds of spam emails of impending terrorist attacks and jihad strikes with trollface attachments. In short, do everything to disrupt their domination of the web. Although the NSA is a massive adversary with immense computer power, I imagine that a large enough group of very determined people could bring it down. And even if we fail to bring it down, we send a clear message to those who abuse the power vested in them by the people and trammel the basic rights of man. <br /><br />What say you SR?

				Not a good idea. Besides having no effect, it will only put SR higher on the LE radar. There are other, more effective ways to fight NSA.&nbsp; On the clearweb: &lt;https://rally.stopwatching.us/&gt;&nbsp; &lt;https://nsa.anonops.com/&gt; are just 2 of many examples.

				Yeah. Let&#039;s kick dirt in the face of the only organization with the capabilities to take this site down. You&#039;re an idiot. Go back to high school.
