				Title: <strong>Questions About PO Boxes</strong><br />

				I&#039;m looking into to getting a PO box instead of shipping it to my house. Is this a good or bad idea? Do PO boxes get more personal attention then standard mail? Also, do you need to be 18 to get a PO box?<br /><br />It just seems like the best way in order to avoid suspicion from the other people living in my house.<br /><br />

				You may need to provide ID to get a PO Box, but that&#039;s still better than giving your address to a drug dealer.<br /><br />I really cannot condone a minor buying drugs on SR. This is all about consenting adults. If you&#039;re not 18, I&#039;m sorry but you shouldn&#039;t be here.

				Yeah you know a kids&#039; mind needs to develop.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I didn&#039;t start smoking weed until I went to college.&nbsp; That&#039;s the time to experiment.&nbsp;

				Many Post Offices require an ID and proof of local physical residence for a box these days, so there isn&#039;t that much of a difference. Having stuff sent to your home isn&#039;t altogether that risky anyway, read (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=196377.0) Though after seeing your age, I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re hiding your activities from the folks. I highly doubt they will rent you a PO box, good luck. I don&#039;t think anyone under 20 should be doing 95% of the stuff available on SR, but since you&#039;re already here and are gonna do whatever, don&#039;t take more than you know you can handle and don&#039;t get caught!

				well your going to need 2 forms of id one picture and one with a proof of address such as auto insurance utility bill go to the usps web site they will give you a full list however im assuming you want it in a different name so thats when getting those documents gets tricky not to mention its a felony offence not only opening a p.o. box under a false name but receiving drugs in the mail and identity theft looking at 5-25 year minimum. So its important you go in there and dont act like a little bitch. get in get out only use the p.o. box a couple of shipments cancel it and move it to a different part of town or go around town find houses for sale that are vacant do an address/ name search online then have the products sent to those mail boxes just keep an eye on them. with money all the information in the world is available to you. stay smart stay safe
