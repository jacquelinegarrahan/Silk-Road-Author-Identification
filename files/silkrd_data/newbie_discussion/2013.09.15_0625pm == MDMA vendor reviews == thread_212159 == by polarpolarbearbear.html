				Looks like you didn&#039;t find much of a quality MDMA here. I would recommend The Avengers MDMA thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.0<br /><br />You can also post your experiences there when you reach 50 posts, so they don&#039;t disappear in the newbie discussion.

I would like to add a few words about your recent product purchase. UnderGroundSyndicate promotes his MDMA as &quot;Supertrips 84% pure&quot;, and usatousadutchxtc does the same thing. If we took the same &quot;Supertrips 84% MDMA&quot;, I personally would order MDMA from these vendors only when it is necessary since the main benefit of buying locally is the shipping time(check my usatousadutchxtc review on the top page if you haven&#039;t) while the product price is usually higher than other international offer. <br />

				I just ordered a capsule from 9asay late Friday night. No reply to my message but it wasn&#039;t entirely needed. Started to get worried when my other order was marked In Transit with no change to that order yesterday. Saw the vendor hadn&#039;t been online either, but it was marked In Transit early this morning. Will post a review when I receive it.

I looked at the vendor page and at this moment, he only sells 10g MDMA which I consider too big of amount and it would be more heartbreaking if it doesn&#039;t live up to your expectation. If I were you, I would give it a shot to Aidoneus (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4130a471f2) because this vendor sells smaller quantity and the reviews have been positive so far. Anyway, good luck with your order and don&#039;t forget to share your experience here&nbsp; :)

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I would like to ask some input regarding of the next MDMA vendor that you would like to be reviewed here in my thread. I planned to review Symbiosis&#039; but I was out on a concert recently and he is out of stock now. Here are a few vendor that I&#039;m interested to review. Let me know what do you think.<br /><br />a) GoodForNothing<br />b) Schizofreen<br />c) Haizenberg<br />d) Bungee54<br /><br />PPBB<br /><br />

If you read his discussion page you&#039;ll see there&#039;s quite a few people who haven&#039;t received anything in several weeks.
