				I personally don&#039;t want a 1/2 oz at my door after going through customs. I will probably just get some hash or BHO. &amp; that&#039;s wierd about not getting good medical even still. I get top notch but Im only several states away from legality!

				Just saying bro, if you can find ounces of loud in your area for 300 then if you talk to the right people you can probably get them for $250.&nbsp; If I bought O&#039;s on the reg I could get them for $250 - at most $280.&nbsp; Not trying to brag or anything, just saying if you look hard enough you might can find better deals locally

				I&#039;m in southern Spain and weed is pretty cheap and well grown here :) <br />I pay between 3.5 and 5€ per gram for near-medical quality bud. You can pay more if you want to but the increase in price isn&#039;t worth the small increase in quality. One of the great tings about being here though is the proximity to Morocco, so I can get really good hash for around 2€ a gram, or less :)<br />- JH

				Looking at £220 on oz here in britfag land<br />Standard over here is pound a point, as in 1 gram is £10 and so on.<br /><br />Ridiculous prices and most of the weed was utter shite, or it was too strong and just fucked your brain, hence why i quit.

				yeah it has remained 30 for an eighth everywhere I&#039;ve been in Canada for like 15 years now. I still pay no more than $200/oz for fantastic indoor hydro. <br /><br />Odd how drug price expectations can be so rigid that they basically trump inflation, at least in local markets. Obviously the sky is the limit here, people paying crazy ass prices for dank by mail
