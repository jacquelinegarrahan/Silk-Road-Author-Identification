				Many of you probably already know... but for the sake of spreading words of wisdom, you should definitely try to protect your stats! Keeping a 0% auto-finalize rate shows that you are not a lazy bastard, and that makes vendors almost 100% willing to work with you. I say almost, because you also have to account for your REFUND %age. I understand not every transaction goes smoothly, but try to approach the respective vendor first, politely, and be as patient as possible! This is crucial for both you and the vendor. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen it all too many times where a legit buyer ruins their stats, AND a vendor&#039;s stats all because of a misunderstanding. I&#039;ve also watched people cancel orders and then receive the order the next day. I understand that for vendors, when they mark and order &quot;in transit&quot; all of the information on the buyer, including the address field, vanishes. So, some vendors may not mark orders in-transit right away because they are following the rules, and don&#039;t want to write your info down anywhere but where it SHOULD be... AND encrypted. <br /><br />Not every vendor deserves a 100% rating, and not ever buyer is expected to leave a 5/5 rating. But there definitely needs to come a time on Silk Road where everyone is a bit more honest. Buyers will argue about other buyers not updating their feedback... vendors will argue about buyers trying to manipulate their ratings for blackmail. These things happen here... and it&#039;s something that we should all actively try to correct. If I buy something that I wasn&#039;t satisfied with, I always contact the vendor immediately. If they don&#039;t respond within a reasonable amount of time, it goes to resolve. There&#039;s extensions that can be made, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --My point is, this isn&#039;t a war-zone. We &#039;should&#039; all be adults here; and we can work out our differences.<br /><br />So, that&#039;s the advice I&#039;m giving to newbies... Protect your purchasing stats, cause they count or something. And protect the stats of existing, proven, good vendors... seek resolve before leaving 1/5 ratings with nasty words. MOST of the good (97-100% rated) vendors on here, in my experience, are very knowledgeable and good people.<br /><br />46 more posts to go.&nbsp; ;D
