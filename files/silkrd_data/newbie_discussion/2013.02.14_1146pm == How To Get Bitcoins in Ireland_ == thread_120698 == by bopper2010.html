				Hi I am a total noob to the Silk Road, I live in Ireland and I have been having trouble finding a reputable website or vendor that I can purchase Bitcoins from in Euro&#039;s and make purchases on Silk Road. I have tried a few sites but most are UK based or US based and dont seem to meet my needs, I have looked through the list of Vendors and I just am not sure which ones to choose, if anybody could help me or if there are any Irish users on here who could point me in the right direction all help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance.

				Ireland is in the Eurozone. You need to search for accounts that can be credited from a Euro bank account.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably going to have to do a wire transfer and pay some banking fees and most likely there will be a delay before you get your coins while the transfer goes through.<br /><br />How far are you from Northern Ireland and do you have any friends in the UK who could assist you?

				I was in the same situation. I used Eircoin for the first time this week and I&#039;m very impressed. https://www.eircoin.net/<br /><br />You can buy anonymously by lodging cash into any AIB or Ulster Bank. I was a bit nervous about paying cash upfront, but the Bitcoin appears in my SR account within hours. Going to use again tomorrow.
