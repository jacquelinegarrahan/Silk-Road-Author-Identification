				So, I finally got a chance to sample Tessellated s LSD.&nbsp; Six people total, including me.&nbsp; My impression is below, and the collective impression from my friends follows.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Mine:&nbsp; Mixed, given the rave reviews that the forums have provided, but that may just be me.&nbsp; After a hit, the most I got out of it was borderline; slight tracers, and, if I concentrated *really* hard, a little bit of motion.&nbsp; Mostly just anxiousness and disappointment.&nbsp; This is coming from someone who has fairly extensive experience with hallucinogens, but no tolerance buildup to LSD given the time that has elapsed since I last took it.&nbsp; In terms of my physical tolerance, this will give you an idea:&nbsp; the last time I took it I had a mind-blowing, textbook experience that was shatteringly positive and visually interesting, off of a single hit of street acid of questionable quality --it&#039;s low.&nbsp; But Tessellated&#039;s just didn&#039;t fit that category, and certainly not at the 200ug range.&nbsp; It&#039;s easily identifiable once you&#039;ve landed there.&nbsp; <br /><br />** HOWEVER, like I said above, this might just be me.&nbsp; I was with five other friends who all gave it an A.&nbsp; Six people, 5 positive, 1 negative.&nbsp; This is important!&nbsp; The evening was fun; we sat around the fire and drew for hours, and we all felt very open and warm.&nbsp; Everyone reportedly found themselves in the &quot;lsd space&quot;.&nbsp; Just not me.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as my own personal tolerance, the only explanation I can provide is my recent experimentation with DMT which may have had a detrimental effect on my ability to appreciate and experience other hallucinogens, this vendors LSD included.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of a physiological correlation, but it&#039;s still a possibility.&nbsp; <br /><br />Given that I&#039;ve ordered quite a bit from this vendor, and after reading a recent, negative feedback item on his wall,&nbsp; I&#039;m eager to continue exploring under the assumption that it&#039;s an issue with me, not it --especially given the level of enjoyment my friends got out of it.&nbsp; Next time I will take two hits rather than one, and take notes during the experience.&nbsp; His communication and stealth is the best I&#039;ve seen on the Road, easily.&nbsp; He is still an A+ vendor in my book.&nbsp; I give him the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; I&#039;m just disappointed after two weeks of anticipation buildup.&nbsp; <br /><br />And so, though this may be a bit of a contrast to the multitude of positive reviews, it is honest and thus relevant.&nbsp; Thought I would take the time to write it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will report back after the next trip with an update.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				Yes I too would probably be dissapointed with one tab. A week ago I tried one of tess&#039;s tabs and with no bitterness or taste at all, I figured hey whats the worst that can happen? and dropped 3 more. I do not regret this at all despite it being one of the most intense drug experiences of my life. I could literally feel the love and precision that the chemist put into the molecule. Anyways I would highly recomend the experience to anyone who wants to fully experience a trip.<br />Last night I decided to drop another 2 tabs only this time I ate some magnesium beforehand to try to subdue some of the jaw clenching effects.&nbsp; I was filled with an&nbsp; anxiety and my stomach kept making strange noises, yet my visual field was not very interrupted. Around +3hours I decided to do a small line of K and smoke some weed. This was a very good idea because this is when the actual trip started. I have a jar that has over 10 varieties of mmj in it and I kept pulling out nugs and setting them under a very bright examination light to try to decipher what a nug is made out of. At one point I tried looking at the nugs in the jar but was distracted by how there appeared to be 109281024 reflections in the jar. I tried to figure out what a reflection was made out of. There was a moment when I was trying to line up all the reflections in the jar and I did and I was momentarily taken out of my body and entered this super tripping headspace. At the time I called it a &quot;point of infinity&quot; because it just seemed like what i was experiencing. <br />Overall the experience was less intense than my first trip&nbsp; but I would definitely say that I learned more.&nbsp; I learned that even though I thought I knew a lot, there are so many different things that I really have not taken the time to examine all the details. The beautiful nugs have been part of my life for years yet I never sat down and REALLY tried to figure out what they were made of. Overall I spent about 2 hours staring at nugs and I thought it was funny how I could literally have spent days looking at those nugs. If I can simply deconstruct a nug or a reflection in my mind&#039;s eye, then there is nothing in the world that I can&#039;t deconstruct to understand. -that was the major insight of my trip. <br /><br />Next time you order, drop 5 and experience the true power of the LSD molecule :)<br />

				By the way I am not bad-mouthing the one hit experience in any way nor am i saying the tabs are weak. I have had plenty of friends look me in the eye and tell me that one tab was the most intense acid experience that they have had...I just personally prefer the higher doses. Happy tripping&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve just placed an order from Tessellated, and will give my review here once I receive it. Very excited, though! I&#039;ve only had the opportunity to trip on LSD one other time.

				I received Tess&#039;s product within the time frame stated. Packaging was superb.<br /><br />I dropped one tab under my tongue T = 0 and stepped outside to start my day. The plans were to go to an IMAX theater and some museums around it. The movie started at T + 40 minutes and lasted for 45 minutes. The come up was awesome. Coming up on one tab while watching astronauts fix the hubble space telescope in IMAX 3D was a great experience. There was no body load at all. And if there was, a tingling throughout my body overshadowed it. <br /><br />At T+2:00 I found myself sitting at a patterned table inside a restaurant. If I looked at the table through my peripherals the pattern would dance and combine within itself. I was feeling giddy. At 3:30 we entered another movie and scenes of the ocean and clouds had that self-similar fractal nature that comes with LSD.<br /><br />At T+4:00 we were walking around outside and everything felt crisp, clean, and magnificent. <br /><br />We began to smoke medical marijuana at T+5:00 and had a grand time. The one tab allowed a clear head space and room for great conversation. We were smoking with others that were not on the acid and could have a clear two-way conversation with them. When smoking while sober there gets a point where I cease to be social or interested in most things. Smoking on one tab was one of the most fun I&#039;ve had with marijuana for a while. I could take bigger hits without coughing and overall felt very fresh. I could feel my stomach churning and making noises starting at around T+5:00 but it was nothing out of the ordinary for LSD. By this time everything had a clay/cartoon character to it and focusing on objects caused them to wiggle and dance.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very positive experience. One tab was not overwhelming and allowed me to walk around a busy college campus/city and interact with others face to face and without sunglasses covering my eyes. I was able to fall asleep at T+15:00. Although it should be noted I have trouble falling asleep when smoking large amounts of weed. <br /><br />I have tried street LSD 2 times and SR LSD 2 times. The last SR LSD I had were the Dalai Lama blotters from Neurotic Narcotic about 11 months ago. They were listed at 250 ug and one of those gave me a stronger experience than one of Tess&#039;s tabs. Both Tess&#039;s tabs and the Dalai Lama&#039;s beat the shit out of street acid. The feeling from these is a pure, expansive feeling that cannot be compared to the hot-flash/uncomfortable feel of the street acid I have tried. <br /><br />This is a great product from a great vendor. A friend I was apprehensive about trying LSD but eventually decided to drop with us. He had a wonderful time and remarked how surprised he was of the mellowness of the drug. Highly recommend one dose to introduce others to LSD and more if one really wants a strong experience.
