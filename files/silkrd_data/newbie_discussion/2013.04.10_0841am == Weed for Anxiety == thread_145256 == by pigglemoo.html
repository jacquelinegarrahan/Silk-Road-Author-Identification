				So, I have a lot of anxiety issues but the weed I usually have doesn&#039;t really help, it just makes me quite introverted. I want to get some Sativa from SR as I&#039;ve not been able to find any on the UK streets (think our dealer is just a bit shit, tbh, and sells whatever he can get his paws on), and was wondering what people&#039;s experience with this strain is?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :D

				What strain? There&#039;s countless types of sativa strains. A good strong indica will probably be better for anxiety.

				Showing up my newbness there ;) <br /><br />Got my eye on some Lemon Haze. From the look of this lovely website, I think it would be quite good for me&nbsp; - http://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Well, it certainly could be. Obviously people can have vastly different reactions to the same effects. Sativa highs are much more cerebral though, so they can sometimes amplify whatever you have going on in your head (anxiety, paranoia, etc.). You might also want to try out some indica dominant hybrids to see how you react to those.

				Thanks for the recommendation, I&#039;ll have a looksy now and see what I can find. I think I will still try some lemon haze, but only get a tiny amount, like a gram, so if it does make me worse I don&#039;t feel like I have to smoke it all anyway. There&#039;s so much variety on here - for somebody used to picking up off a shitty dealer, it&#039;s a bit over-whelming!

				Yes indica would probably be better. It&#039;s cheaper and you can get roughly 2 times as much as you would for the same price of sativa. Sativa is more of a clean head high, whereas indica is more mongy and will help you sleep better if that&#039;s an issue.

				Dear Pigglemoo.... I&#039;m 55 and had gotten to where I simply could not smoke pot due to the intense anxiety I felt after smoking. I ordered some Purple Power 95% Sativa from NorCalKing and it was the answer to my problem! I had never had the option of actually being able to choose a particular type of pot until SR and the weed my kids have is mostly Indica which leaves me wanting to crawl under the floor. Anyhow, I have to disagree with the posters recommending Indica... try some Purple Power and see if it doesn&#039;t solve your problem...<br /><br />Good luck and I hope you find the correct medicine for your needs.

				Thanks both!<br /><br />Like ToadStool, I&#039;ve not been in a position where I can actually pick my type before. I think I&#039;ll get a small amount of a few different types (will definitely try some Purple Power, thanks for that) and see what helps me most. It sounds like Sativa is a much buzzier high that I&#039;m used to; if nothing else that would be a nice thing to experience!

				If you can find some strawberry cough it has excellent stress relieving qualities. Not a great yielder but top notch smoke and over 70 percent Sat. genes.

				Tbh ime/imo etc (will stop the abv&#039;s now, mebbe)....weed just &#039;aint the best thing for anxiety issues whatsoever. <br /><br />Some prefer Sativa&#039;s for anxiety, others Indica. What I have observed is that both can alleviate anxiety for the for hour or so of being stoned, then said anxiety seems to get worse.<br /><br />I would recommend some quality hashish if you&#039;re looking for an anxiolytic smoke.<br /><br />

				Now that&#039;s an excellent suggestion too Intra... I&#039;ve been eyeing the wonderful selection of hash that is available on SR. Thank the gods for SR and all of the ingenious solutions it offers to everyone. Also, let&#039;s be sure to thank the U.S. Naval Research Center for developing tor... and of course all involved in Bitcoins. Speaking of BTC, I&#039;ve paid for my last four transactions by using the appreciation of value of my coins in my account... When I first loaded up my account I was purchasing BTC for $14 each. They crapped out today and I picked up another $1000 worth @ $136 per coin. I checked a minute ago and they are back up to $179.

				I have to agree with Intraterrestrial. I generally suffer from bad anxiety and after a period of smoking nearly every day for a year weed would just make my anxiety worse. Sad as I used to use it as a tool to relax, but I gave up smoking every day and found that, with the right mental attitude, a good Sativa wipes away my stress and actually makes me social. So good luck to you pigglemoo, I know how much of a monster anxiety can be. Hopefully cannabis helps you more than it did me, though I suppose doing something every day for a year will have side effects lol.
