				Specifically I would like to know if user watlanboon is legit, this is my first time buying :) so I&#039;m just trying to be safe. He seems good, since he has so much feedback and it&#039;s all good, but I figured it wouldn&#039;t hurt to ask in here.<br /><br />also any other tips etc on buying and stuff would be much appreciated :)<br /><br />thankyou.<br /><br />-- FOLLOW UP EDIT:<br /><br />WatLanBoon is really cool. He&#039;s my favorite vendor here now. His packaging was great, and the shipping was roughly on time as well! <br />WatLanBoon: A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />I made this post out of paranoia because it was my first time ever doing anything like this. lol<br /><br />When buying from WatLanBoon:<br />FE is not required ever, and you aren&#039;t penalized in any way for not FE. You do receive benefits for FE though.<br /><br />

				Just my two cents<br />Nothing about him on forum but not everyone wants to come here. <br /><br />&quot;Buyers willing to FE are subject to preferential treatment, compliments, smiley faces, free joints, fatter sacks etc. If you are willing to FE, make it known so I can sweeten your item/s.<br />Buyers unwilling to FE will NOT be penalised in ANY way, you will ALL get what you paid for and usually a little on top if its available.&quot;<br /><br />Do you feel lucky, is it a small purchase, can you live with the odds or will you cry all over the forum if you don&#039;t get your product, remember it will be a total gamble <br /><br />&quot;has been a member for 2 months - sales match 2 months<br />was last seen: today - this is good sign<br />ranked in the top 57% of sellers with 100% positive feedback from 70 transactions - 100% is good and from many transactions<br />has 59 fans - become a fan&quot; - fans are good sign<br /><br />FE you might get a small reward, Non-FE you are safer. I would FE on first purchase for the small offerings but that&#039;s just my comfort level with gambling and my money situation. Remember no crying if it doesn&#039;t work out. You can leave it on the feedback or post once here in a review thread your experience. I would never FE on the larger listing especially with no prior purchase history with this vendor unless you are comfortable with the possible loss.<br />

				The only boon you get for FE is the joy of getting ripped off. <br /><br />This has to be the most stupid argument in favor of FE I heard yet. <br /><br />Be warned! Once you free the funds there is nothing SR can or will do for you. Many new people have found this out the hard way.

Maybe I&#039;m missing something. Did you look at that vendors listings? Everything was under $30 or so and only one item was an oz. If you are that worried about a $20-30 gamble don&#039;t do it lol I agree.

				The real answer is you DO NOT NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FAKE FEEDBACK... there is NO NEED. As if you deal with vendors&nbsp; that have been here more then 4 months and have a 100 or 99 score..then the fact is they do not have fake feedback. It just is not need to be done and there is no upside to it. Also there is just no need..NONE. So you will not come across it. So don&#039;t waste your time on something that is of little significance anyways.. If you even think that you need to question a vendors feedback..then move on to another vendor! There are plenty of vendors here. And plenty of really good ones!<br /><br /><br />Good Luck

				Well, I&#039;ll disagree with that. Fake feedback could lead you astray. There&#039;s no way to know who left it, what their history is, if they&#039;re a mocked-up account, whatever. If I think they&#039;re for real, then I pay attention to what they have to say, and about what (hovering over item to find out what they got). If I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re for real, or there isn&#039;t enough history to tell...<br /><br />I come to the forums and search. Now you can see who (supposedly) supports a vendor. What&#039;s their history? Long-time user or just one or two posts? If long-time, have a browse at their posting history. Are they for reals? Do they seem to give balanced advice and reviews? If so, all good. If you&#039;re still unsure, find another vendor.<br /><br />Don&#039;t turn off your brain just because someone says &quot;don&#039;t worry&quot;. Do your research, then trust your instincts. Have a good time.

				Nice to see my name in &#039;lights&#039;....<br /><br />Not 1 of my feedbacks over 3 pages is fake, forged, stolen, bribed or extorted.<br /><br />So far as i am aware the only way to even get &#039;fake&#039; feedback is to have multiple accounts and sell yourself stuff and leave feedback to yourself.<br /><br />I sell weed all over the world, i have satisfied buyers in 5 continents. <br /><br />People telling other people that they will ONLY get burned if they FE are retards.<br /><br />Shit goes both ways brothers &amp; sisters.<br /><br />I have sent out THREE packages to one &#039;buyer&#039; who as far as i know could be smoking my 5g, while not even paying for the initial 1.5 which i added in 0.5 free cos i wanted good feedback...<br /><br />If you never FE you will never know the joyous feeling of putting trust in a stranger &amp; seeing it rewarded in kind.<br /><br />If you ever FE and get ripped off its not your fault, its the rip-off scamcunt that ripped you off.<br /><br />Ive been ripped off for cash, bitcoins, weed and joints. <br /><br />My first ever purchase with btc was for hardware costing 100+btc. Yet to be shipped.... have i been ripped off? is there any possibility of a refund?<br /><br />My second ever btc purchase WILL be with Tyl3r Durden and I WILL 100% FE.<br /><br />In fact i will do it now, just to prove a point to myself.<br /><br />if TD rips me or it never arrives is it my fault for FEing or could there be some fault elsewhere that gets overlooked when the scammed/paranoid need to blame someone.<br /><br />Shit Happens, Some People Are Cunts, FE can be risky...<br /><br />I Give Away FREE Joints &amp; FREE half grams to buyers who are happy to FE.<br /><br />Where lies the risk in that for the buyer?<br /><br />Might i wish to tarnish my own reputation for the reward of less than 1btc?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />

IMPOSSIBLE! And even if they created an account and &quot;bought something&quot; form themselves it would be a HUGE waste of time and would mean very little to their overall score.. Do you understand?<br /><br />Now if you are talking about a vendor that has been here for 3 weeks with 8 feed backs and is in the top 90% then YES those type of vendors can fake feedback...but who in the world is buying from them anyways??? <br /><br />So like I said...it is a stupid waste of time to look for fake feedback...you will not find fake feedback on a vendor that has over 300 trans feedback score.actions that is in the top 20% and has a 100 score. As the so called fake feedback you guys keep referring to what be done from an account they control and it would be for a free item or one that cost very little as they lose 10% to SR and no vendor is going to fake feedback that cost them money. It just does not happen in today&#039;s Silk Road. It would make NO SENSE at all..NONE.&nbsp; So there is NO WAY fake feedback could lead you astray.. In fact in your make believe that you believe could&nbsp; lead someone astray...give a scenario that could happen??? Were someone could , by fake feedback, be led astray? LOL.... It can not even be done in a make believe setting!&nbsp; <br /><br />As I said... you do not understand the feedback system and rating&#039;s to understand how silly and a waste of time it would be and that you could not leave enough feedback for it to matter...let alone it would be pointless!!&nbsp; I believe you are coming to this conclusion because you can not see who left the feedback for the vendor..so you believe that because of this that vendors could leave fake feedback. Again this makes no sense....<br /><br />&nbsp;And you said-----<br /><br />If I think they&#039;re for real, then I pay attention to what they have to say, and about what (hovering over item to find out what they got). If I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re for real, or there isn&#039;t enough history to tell<br /><br />This again makes NO SENSE!! You should not take any 1 feedback to mean anything..you take there score the 100 or the 99, the time they have been a vendor and their rankings...then you can read the feedback to get an overal opinion.. But if you are dealing with a 100 with a vendor that has been here 6+ months and is in the top 20% then you can rst assure they are legit and doing EVERYTHING right!! And then you can read their feedback and see what EVERYONE has to say...not just 1 or 2 people...Also you should read the feedback on the item that you want that they are selling...and there overall feedback...but again if you stick to top vendors there is NO CONCERN!! Also all this can be trumped with one easy thing..Get ready for it... DO NOT FE!!! It is that simple....if you do not FE..then it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to get scammed...PERIOD!!!<br /><br /><br />My god...what vendors are you buying from where you need to come to the forums...look up who supports them and then look up the supporters history???? You are fucking nuts!!! And you are clearly taking full advantage of what SR is all about...DRUGS!! Please tell us what you are on and who you got it from!!! <br /><br />How about do nothing this guy says..just go to there vendor page...and if they have a 100 and have been here for 5+ months..the more the better..and if they are in the top 20% then you can bet that every feedback is golden and you are going to be too...if you want a good laugh read what this guy does or claims he does... I will put it down here...<br /><br />So he looks for fake feedback...he then looks them up on the forums...then he looks up the people that support the vendor...he then looks up those peoples post to see if they are balanced and to see if they are long term users or new ones and if that does not pan out and it doe s not feel right...he then moves on to another vendor!! OMG this is INSANE!!&nbsp; It is insane that you believe that vendors fake their feedback!<br /><br />All you need to do is go to their vendor page..that&#039;s it!! The mistakes people make...and the funny thing is that it is what this guy talks about!! The mistakes are the ones that listen to the forums!! Good or bad do not listen!! Go to there page and read the feed backs! Read them all..then see how long they have been a vendor...see if they are 100 and you are golden if they are in the top 20%. With all those things....it is IMPOSSIBLE to deal with a bad vendor!! I M P O S S I B L E<br /><br />I hope you guys understand how silly this is and you lock this thread..

				Well hey, why spend five minutes checking out a vendor when you can make up your mind in thirty seconds? It&#039;s not like anything is at stake. Say, your cash, your package, or your freedom.<br /><br />My favourite part is how no one in their right mind buys from vendors with short histories. I&#039;d like Mr. Wizard to tell me how these vendors get those first 300 buys. Magic, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m all for people showing their stripes. People can find out ahead of time what they&#039;re in for.

Which is why I do the research. Vendor with little history could be a ripoff artist starting with a fresh account, could be LE, who knows? So yeah, I look at forum posts, and if they&#039;re all people with just a few posts themselves (which can sometimes suspiciously be the case), I walk. Because those people have no history, either. Make no mistake, if I were in a big market, I wouldn&#039;t touch those guys (despite knowing that vendors have to start somewhere - I&#039;m happy to let someone else take that chance). But I&#039;m regularly looking at products a few relative unknowns are selling domestically, or else I have to go international. Either is risky.

				Accounts cost almost $2000 now. <br /><br />Also it is IMPOSSIBLE to fake enough feedback for it to matter. Also when a buyer leaves feedback....(as you said earlier and they say will but again what will they buy again?) it will tell you the item they bought and are leaving feedback for.<br /><br /><br />The facts are that the last thing anyone on here needs to do is look for fake feedback. That was the only point of my post. Doing so is a total waste of time. I do understand that if you are in a small market that you might not have a lot of options so you might have to trust a vendor that does not have that many feedback&#039;s or is new. And if that is the case...don&#039;t FE and you will be fine. <br /><br />The bottom line is if you can chose a vendor that has been here over 4 months and has 100 feedback and over 300 transactions then you are in good hands. PERIOD.

				How do these fake accounts manifest good feedback then? Just from FE&#039;ing?<br />I note that quite a large number of vendors ask to FE - i&#039;m assuming it&#039;s ok to do so if they&#039;re a reputable vendor?

				I have been monitoring the profiles of Emonkey and Cocezero recently, due to orders already placed, and have noticed something very suspicious. Every time someone reports with any negative feedback within an hour or two &quot;someone else&quot; from a sham account finalizes to contradict the previous statement. It is very obvious imho to detect fake feedback if you are paying attention and monitoring the feedback of a vendor due to a current order.&nbsp;

				Yea the feedback system is easy to manipulate. Always better to check the forums. <br /><br />Some vendors not only require FE but you must also leave a 5/5 in feedback before they even ship. <br /><br />Sometimes it isn&#039;t even that dishonest as some people might find a vendor to be mediocre at best but buyers don&#039;t want to tank a vendors stats. That has to be annoying to the top vendors who go out of their way to ship quick and discreetly. It isn&#039;t fair to them that their is no way to differentiate them from sub par vendors.<br /><br />Just read here that someone indicated rxking might be a scammer. He could use some better people skills sometimes but he isn&#039;t a scammer from what I hear. I haven&#039;t purchased from him but know someone who has and got their package timely and was just as described. <br /><br />

				Some interesting speculation in the (original) Enter The Matrix review thread about faking feedback, both on SR and in the forums - no idea if its grounded or not, but w/r/t the forums, it&#039;s exactly what I described - glowing reviews from total unknowns.<br /><br />$2000 for a vendor account. Well, that&#039;s a big investment. And you hit the Road with *zero* sales. And let&#039;s not forget - no one in their right mind will buy from those guys, right RX? So what&#039;s a vendor to do? Well, it&#039;s not like you need multiple vendor accounts to fake feedback. 5 minutes and some spare bitcoins and you&#039;re ready to go. You don&#039;t even need multiple buy accounts because it doesn&#039;t show who made the purchases. A few sales, no actual shipping. That&#039;s so difficult it&#039;s inconceivable, is it? I could easily imagine legit vendors &quot;helping themselves&quot; out that way, justifying that they aren&#039;t ripping anyone off and don&#039;t intend to, all in service of the very numbers game being touted here as the ultimate protection. <br /><br />I am deeply suspicious of someone who claims it&#039;s too difficult or unprofitable that it&#039;s never done. Saying it&#039;s impossible is pure idiocy (and even more cause for suspicion).

				&nbsp;Fact is, that it may be possible to buy fake feedback right here on SR on the services page. It&#039;s one of the very last entries on the services listings, and it quite boldly states that if you pay the guy a point of a BTC he will add glowing reports about your shit from a great number of accounts that he himself obviously, personally possesses. <br />&nbsp;Maybe it&#039;s a honey pot started by the originators of SR to protect against cunts such as these from doing just that, I&#039;m not sure because i don&#039;t know, but i do know the advertisement exists.<br />In theory creating great feedback on purchases that never went through is not that hard to do, and of course, SR like any other internet sales business market model, has these sorts flaws in it that scammers are prepared to take advantage of to cheat people to make a profit from.<br />Take a look at Ebay, every day there are pricks on there selling state of the art this and that for $14.99 and after they&#039;ve moved 3k of each item in a night the fake listing is removed by Ebay, but by then the guy&#039;s used his stolen credit card number /hacked bank account number to withdraw the 75k and off he jingles into the distance, all to do it again and again at the next internet cafe and they&#039;re powerless to stop him cause they make a profit either way!<br />&nbsp;If a company that big is as fucked as that&nbsp; at stopping this sort of thing then don&#039;t think SR is also immune.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair insinuate RxKing is using fake feedback. He may not be very diplomatic, but I think he&#039;s giving us his honest perspective. <br /><br />That said, there&#039;s some fairly obvious self-interest bias at work in his argument. Of course a top ranked seller is going to think that only going to top ranked sellers is the best way to avoid getting scammed. It&#039;s BS that going to an established big name is a foolproof way to avoid scamming, though. There&#039;s a long history of the big dogs doing exit scams or selectively scamming newbies who often have no choice but to FE. <br /><br />Fake feedback could easily be a major undetected problem. It&#039;s a major issue on every online marketplace and review site, so it&#039;s naive to imagine it could never be a problem on SR. If someone were willing to invest the time and money, it could even be worth their while to spend a few months faking their way into the top tier of their market. In small or chronically under-served markets (like USA LSD) it wouldn&#039;t even be that hard to do. Most scammers aren&#039;t long-term thinkers, but history has shown us that the most successful ones are. It&#039;s standard practice in other online markets for scammers to fluff their stats with fake sales, either with dummy accounts or paying other people to leave feedback for things they haven&#039;t bought. And even in the case of people who aren&#039;t actively scamming, sellers with poor customer service or shoddy merchandise could very easily use fake feedback to keep their stats from dipping below that critical 90% mark.<br /><br />Also, competition is an important part of maintaining the health and sustainability of any market, so it&#039;s in the best interest of the community for people to use more than just the big established brands. So at some point somebody is going to have to take a risk on newer sellers. Building a knowledge base for consumers to make the best possible decision just seems like a rational, free market approach to the problem. Possible fake feedback can&#039;t be your only avenue of inquiry, but it is one viable tool among many.<br /><br />I would suggest there are some things to look out for:<br /><br />Do they have a large number of digital goods sales (or other small, cheap items) but not much of what you&#039;re actually looking for?<br />Does a lot of their feedback come from weird shit that there doesn&#039;t seem to be a real market for?<br />Are there large blocks of feedback that are written very similarly in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure?<br />Does all the feedback seem too good to be true? (Even the best sellers get bitchy feedback from unreasonable people, this is doubly true when you&#039;re selling drugs)<br />Do large blocks of feedback seem designed to refute a particular piece of bad feedback? (Could be a sign of loyal clientele OR a selective scammer covering his tracks)<br /><br />Those are all I can think of right now. I would hope others might add to the list (particularly any who&#039;ve been burned by fake feedback).<br />

				+1 strangeman !<br /><br />It&#039;s like a RULE in IT history. If some hack is possible to do, then some people will exploit (note the term used) it at one point. Obviously.<br /><br />RxKing, could you provide any technical means preventing sellers from creating fake feedbacks ? I can&#039;t see why it would be impossible at all.<br /><br />The only real way to identify fake feedbacks is probably for SR admins. If you can correlate data from buyers (money spent on SR ?) with data from sellers (how many orders done ?), then you can detect abnormal behaviours. It&#039;s quite obvious that a vendor receiving 200 feedback in one month with 95% of them coming from &quot;one order buyers&quot; is suspicious and probably faking.<br /><br />I may be naive but i do hope SR teams are working in the background to at least revoke vendors abusing from this method.<br /><br />Remember that the whole SR design is based on the fact that we (buyers) can&#039;t know who bought to someone. At this point if you can&#039;t identify the origin of any feedback, everything is surely possible as it stands.

				Finalizing early is probably the biggest cause of fake feedback.&nbsp; So don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Vendors who require buyers to FE will always have high feedback ratings.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because anyone who finalizes early is going to leave nice feedback to avoid pissing off the vendor who, because they FE&#039;d, now has 100% of the power in the relationship.&nbsp; Buyers will kiss ass in the feedback ratings in the hope that they&#039;ll get shipped some product.&nbsp; They have no leverage any more once they have finalized.<br /><br />Most buyers aren&#039;t even aware that they can go back and change feedback ratings later after they get the shipment (or don&#039;t get it as the case may be).&nbsp; &nbsp;Even buyers who say they&#039;ll update the ratings later rarely do.&nbsp; If you ever look at feedback for vendors who require FE, none of them are ever updated or changed later.<br /><br />So don&#039;t believe the feedback ratings for vendors who require FE.&nbsp; It is 100% useless.

				I have some pretty good advice for this:<br />* Check how frequent feedback is being left, every hour or so? If the vendor is relatively new they will NOT be getting feedback/several feedback every hour.<br />* What item is the feedback left for? Can you also buy this item?<br />* Has feedback been left for custom listings which contain the supposed buyers username?<br />* If custom listings have been purchased, did the same user purchase more than once and if so how many days between posting feedback? For example, often you will see feedback like:<br />5/5 FE&#039;d and got today, Perfect as always man Item= 7g Heroin for ImN0tAS4mm3r 1 hour ago<br />...more feedback 3 hours ago<br />...more feedback&nbsp; 6 hours ago<br />5/5 FE and got no problem! Item = 7g Heroin for ImN0tAS4mm3r 1 day ago<br /><br />&nbsp;ImN0tAS4mm3r is obviously an account controlled by the vendor, who would buy from a new vendor, FE then order again and FE before receiving the first order? No one, so they wait some time before the next order but usually wait a ridiculously short amount of time. Two seperate orders for 7g of heroin shipped in less than a day apart with feedback left? I dont think so.<br /><br />Thats my advice to spot the scamming bastards anyways, and if in doubt post here on the forums! Legitimate vendors wont mind if you are suspicious to start and want assurance from the forums.<br />Lets all try and purge silk road from these scamming bastards!
