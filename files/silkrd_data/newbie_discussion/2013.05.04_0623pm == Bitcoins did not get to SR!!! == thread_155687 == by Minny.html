				I sent bitcoins to SR yesterday. When I was looking at what to buy, it timed out and I just got back in after trying repeatedly since then. By bitcoins have not been received and they are not back in my bitcoin wallet. Can anyone help??

				I was looking more at my transaction and it says it just went today at 2:32pm, 12 minutes to confirm. I&#039;m assuming that it was able to get through to SR till recently, so hopefully soon it will show up. Unfortunately, the minute I tried to leave the initial SR login page it timed out and I can see nothing again. I&#039;ve only been on SR for about a month. Have received a few shipments, but I can&#039;t afford for money to disappear. Or spend days and hours trying to get in either. After this order if the issues are not resolved, as much as I&#039;d hate to, I may have to move go elsewhere : (

				Yea, it usually takes a few hours, I&#039;m was just worried that I sent them last night. But since I see the wallet says they were just sent about an hour ago, I&#039;m not as worried. Just wish I could get back on SR. I wanted to get an order in to ship by Monday : ( Thanks!

If it is a desktop based client then the reason that the transaction was only sent today is because the client has to sync with either the full blockchain (in the case of the bitcoin-qt client) or a partial blockchain (in the case of MultiBit and a few others). Your client only caught up with the block that your transaction was included in at 2:32pm.<br /><br />It can take up to 24 hours for your Bitcoin to reach your Silk Road account, however it normally takes a lot less time than that.<br />If your BTC is not in your Silk Road account within 24 hours, feel free to send a message to SR Support on the main site when it is back up with the details of your transfer so as they can figure out where it is and manually credit it to you.<br /><br />Silk Road is currently under a DDOS attack, and this kind of limited access is unprecedented in Silk Road&#039;s history. It has been online since February 2011 with minimal down-time (~3%), meaning in the 26 months it has been in existence it has been up for approximately 25.22 of those.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts will continue to persevere in his/her efforts to get the site back up, and has a contingency plan in place which you can read more about here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155554.0<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks for the input. It&#039;s been almost 24hrs now, and I&#039;m finally in, so I&#039;ll go ahead and send them a message. But, what info do I give them without compromising my money : ) <br /><br />btw, it&#039;s not a local client, it&#039;s web based and although the wallet says it was just sent today, I put in the transaction almost 24hours ago. It just posted that it was sent at 2:32 today. Not sure what the timezone is on that, definitely not mine. Typically it takes about an hour when I do this, even earlier this week when problems were off and on, so I&#039;m a little concerned.

There is no point in messaging them now as it hasn&#039;t been 24 hours since the transfer was actually initiated.<br /><br />It could very well be an issue with your web-based wallet. Which web-wallet site are you using, if you don&#039;t mind me asking? Feel free to PM me about it, and try checking searching the name on the clearweb to see if any other users had similar issues.<br /><br />Libertas
