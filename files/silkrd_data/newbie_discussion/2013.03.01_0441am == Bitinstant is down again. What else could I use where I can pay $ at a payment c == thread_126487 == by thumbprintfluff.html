				&nbsp;Now I FINALLY got my check but of course I can&#039;t get BTC&quot;s now. Well from bitinstant cause the option to email/location page are down.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a bank account or credit... Have to pay cash.&nbsp; What I really need is someone here to walk me through this!&nbsp; But if someone could be kind enough to answer a few ?&#039;s please.<br />1- Could I, and how would I send my BTC&quot;s right to my SR account? Just for 1st time so I can order right away.<br />2- If I have them sent to an email, then how do you send them here? Just copy and paste the code I get?<br />3- When I signed up on SR, there was a second passcode I had to make up. Is that my PIN?&nbsp; &nbsp;If not how do I set that?<br />4- Do I have any safe/easy options besides bitinstant where I could pay at a local payment center like CVS?<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;m really not a dummy, just when it comes to computers. And I can&#039;t have my people help me cause I&#039;m keeping this secret.&nbsp; Thanks

				Bitinstant permitted&nbsp; anonymous transactions until recently, but it appears they are now requiring email, name and dob<br />and &quot;validating&quot; your ID.&nbsp; I have seen several people mention getting ID errors for small ($250) orders,&nbsp; and requiring<br />photos of government issued ID before they can&nbsp; buy Bitcoin.&nbsp; Their Terms of Use say they record transactions,&nbsp; &nbsp;and <br />may generate statistical reports looking for &#039;suspicious or illegal activity&#039; to comply money laundering laws.&nbsp; <br />They also reserve the right to sell or distribute this info them to third parties.&nbsp; I imagine they have received pressure <br />from government,&nbsp; but that just makes them semi-government agents to me since these agents were made without<br />informing customers of the change from anonymous to tracked transactions.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t trust them.<br /><br />The odd thing is that person buying $200 of Bitcoins per month for 6 months might look suspicious,&nbsp; but the guy who <br />makes a $5000 bank transfer for Bitcoin investments would not raise a second glance.&nbsp; Indeed, Forbes magazine mentioned<br />them as a hot investment.&nbsp; <br />

				Shoot Blue Sky Traders (ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm) an email with your deposit amount. You can take the cash to any Bank of America location and complete an anonymous transfer to their account. Follow up with a confirmation email and they&#039;ll have you your bitcoins in your account in about an hour. I used to use BitInstant myself (still have to for transactions under $100) until I heard about these guys. I&#039;ve been very happy with their service and I&#039;d recommend them to anyone needing quick coin. Best part is that they don&#039;t have any percentage fees like BitInstant, and I&#039;m pretty happy with their levels of anonymity.

				Well what if you don&#039;t have any BoA&#039;s around? I live in a major city, most people would probably say they&#039;ve heard of it if I mentioned it by name, and yet there NO Bank of America&#039;s anywhere near where I live (well, there are, but they only deal in Mortgages apparently).<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to use BitInstant at the moment. Too many questions surrounding them. And yet, like the OP, I absolutely must use cash to make these transactions. I don&#039;t care if that means I have to go to WalMart or CVS or whatever to actually do it, but I need some other method than BitInstant to use cash to attain BitCoin. It is really the only thing standing in my way now from actually getting this ball rolling. Oh, and by the way, BitCoin&#039;s value shot up to over $35 and I think it may be the most valuable it&#039;s ever been? pretty crazy.

				I&#039;ve done a couple transaction with BST and all went smoothly. Got coins to my wallet within about 1 hour.<br />Just email them how much you want to purchase along with your SR wallet address, wait for their reply, and then go deposit.<br /><br />Yes, I believe the second passcode is your PIN. It should be all numbers. You&#039;re going to need your PIN to make purchases on SR.
