			<dd class="postbody">
				I have noticed quite a few people have suggested that someone begin starting up physical parcel remailing services, something like Tor, only for physical packages as opposed to Internet data packets.<br /><br />Has anyone gotten on top of that, or has this market still been relatively untapped?<br /><br />I was considering various approaches for expediting clearing large volumes of remailed parcels through customs and internatonal borders, or even avoiding the mainstream parcel services entirely, relying instead upon freelance couriers and various remailing services that get parcels across national borders and customs checkpoints as rapidly and privately as possible.<br /><br />Has anyone gotten anywhere with this?<br /><br />I have been looking into such things as<br /><br />http://www.stamps.com/warehouse/benefits/technology/<br /><br />and http://www.neopost.com/en/products-solutions/franking-machine<br /><br />to help get parcels through customs by making parcels look like boring uninteresting business-to-business post, as part of a remailer-2-remailer interbusiness agreement to help their remailing customers.<br /><br />The last legs of the journal might be crossed with freelance couriers, while distribution to and from the customs-crossers would be handled by smaller remailing depots, similar to post offices but obviously not the same.<br /><br />Has anyone tried this, and if so, how far has that come? Thanks.
