				This is my first time using the SR, so I&#039;ve been trying to make sure I do everything correctly. <br /><br />I recently made a transaction on June 2nd , and the seller was offering free shipping for FE. Now, being the newbie that I am I did some research to find out what the hell that means. Upon figuring it out, the idea I got was that you should ONLY FE with a trusted seller who has feedback to back up claims of good transactions.<br /><br />The seller is US, and so it&#039;s domestic shipping for me so I&#039;m figuring a few days at the most. The seller marked it as in transit on the 2nd as well. What I&#039;m concerned about is, how long should I wait before I consider changing my feedback from FE? And if it comes to that point, is there anything I can do about it if the product doesn&#039;t come after FE?

				sigh. it is not worth saving a couple bucks in shipping to FE and lose any ability to complain about a vendor. i hope you changed your password and pin before depositing your money because phishing sites abound to ensnare noobs. good luck.

				I&#039;d give it a little more time and I wouldn&#039;t change your feedback to anything negative at this point.&nbsp; I can tell you that sometimes it takes just 2 days to get a package and other times I&#039;ve waited over a week.&nbsp; Like someone would ship on Thursday and I wouldn&#039;t get it until Friday the following week or even the Monday after that.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I recommend you do at this point is drop a message to the vendor and say you haven&#039;t received the package yet and wondered if they could provide you with the tracking information.&nbsp; Some vendors don&#039;t like to do this, but the one time I was waiting and did that the vendor provided it to me.&nbsp; I even checked the tracking with tor browser (which they say not to do.&nbsp; use a regular browser on clearnet) and I had no issues.&nbsp; Hope that helps.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh finally, you have awhile to change feedback and leave feedback so I wouldn&#039;t be in a hurry to write up a negative review.&nbsp; That can be done later if the buyer doesn&#039;t give you a refund or reship.&nbsp;

They haven&#039;t been around for more then a few months, but the feedback has been pretty consistent with good results. But I will take your advise, I guess I shouldn&#039;t been too antsy when it comes to purchasing things off the SR. This system isn&#039;t designed to be a drive-thru, call me eager I guess. Thank you for the advise.
