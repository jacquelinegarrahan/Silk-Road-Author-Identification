				H man, nothing like feeling relaxed and back in the day when I actually could get high off Oxycodone (what I&#039;d give for that again) Oxy&#039;s. They&#039;d make me so happy and I wouldn&#039;t have a care in the world. <br /><br />Anyone know of a drug like that? That just makes you happy, seriously happy and not care about a damn thing? But not fuck with your mind too much. I know a lot of people have pot for that, but I get serious anxiety with most strains and only a few make me upbeat, energetic, happy.

				Probably DMT<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had it once (about a year ago) and it was a pretty horrible trip, but the more i think about it, the more i like the effect it had on me as a person, It&#039;s much more volatile and unpredictable than other psych&#039;s though, which could be good or bad depending on the person, but i quite like it.<br /><br />(Oh lord, i think i&#039;m becoming a hippie.)

				I like three letter acronym drugs. LSD, GHB, DMT, and MXE is pretty good too. But I&#039;d have to say the best high I have ever felt was candy flippin&#039;. I had a half o of the best molly I&#039;ve ever had and bought some pretty decent L on sugar cubes. It was a magical night. Nothing quite beats that first high. I&#039;d say mol is up there, but I got really burned out on it last year. Now it doesn&#039;t appeal to me the same anymore. Any one had 4-HO-MET?

				hmmm, where do I start. <br /><br />LOVE coke way too much. I haven&#039;t allowed it to ruin my life but every time I manage to get a good bit of good shit I realize how easy it would be for me to be a huge coke head. Good thing it&#039;s so expensive. <br />&nbsp;- also, if I was a hot girl (or even just a girl), I&#039;d probably be a coke whore. lol<br /><br />Really good weed is always a great drug to have around (kinda like bread and milk, you just always need to have some on hand). But I&#039;ll never be a daily smoker. It makes me lazy as hell - which in turn makes me hate myself.<br /><br />Oddly, I recently tried ice - which I never thought I would try. I have to say this about ice: if you get good pure stuff and you don&#039;t overdo it (which is easy to do for coke people because we&#039;re used to snorting rails), it can be quite enjoyable. It keeps you awake and productive and active without as much of the jitters that I get from coke sometimes. But it increases your Libido so much that it&#039;s really problematic. And if you do too much, you&#039;re awake for several days which, for me, is not cool. I can see how it is very addictive for some people though. Just watch yourself on that one.<br /><br />Recently discovered Nitrous. That shit is fun as hell. You really can&#039;t do it that much because it&#039;ll give you a headache, but go to your local sex toy store or head shop and grab some sometime. It&#039;s fun as hell. Definitely a happy drug. Good for when you&#039;re pre-gaming with friends for a good rockstar night out.<br /><br />Heroin (I&#039;ve never IV&#039;d it, but I understand the effects are similar just longer) is one of the best drugs for sex in my opinion. Numbs you up just enough to make you last for fucking ever, but doesn&#039;t make it hard to get it up (like coke or meth). You&#039;ve got that nice warm buzzed feeling and it&#039;s a downer so you&#039;re not in a hurry to do anything. Great for taking your sweet time to work over every square inch of whatever sweet thing you happen to be next to. <br /><br />MDMA is pretty good for sex too. But it&#039;s been hit and miss for me. Quality varies so much and tolerance and dosage fucks with your roll. I&#039;ve only really, really had great rolls like 4 times. but unfortunately, 2 of those times my girlfriend was out of sync with me (IE: she wasn&#039;t horny when I was during the roll and vise - versa) which SUCKS because there is nothing worse that getting super horny on x and having NO ONE to fuck! I&#039;ve honestly had my best success with MDMA and sex by taking our rolls separately. IE: she rolls and you be ready to fuck her brains out (sweetly, of course) when she gets horny and a couple nights later it&#039;s your turn. Now that works like a fucking charm if both partners have the patience to do it. (you have to be willing to take your time even though you&#039;re not rolling. Helps to take some other kind of drug like Heroin or pain pills or something.) Of course, MDMA is great for party/dance too.&nbsp; A word of caution: if you&#039;ve built up a tolerance to MDMA, STOP TAKING IT FOR A WHILE. I fucked up my nervous system by trying to up my dosage to get my roll back. It&#039;s back to normal now, but I was getting serious dizzy spells and all kinds of crazy shit. Once you wear out your serotonin receptors (build up tolerance), taking MDMA can start to cause serous damage to your brain chemistry. But if you wait a few months, you can go right back to raving. Yay!<br /><br />Drum roll: SHROOMS!!!!! love &#039;em, love &#039;em, love &#039;em. Best drug for sex. Best drug to do by yourself. Best drug for watching movies. Best drug for being outside in nature. Puts you in touch with...I don&#039;t know: Yourself? maybe? It&#039;s impossible to explain until you try it. But you MUST try it. Be in a loving place with loving people and go into it with a positive attitude and you will come out the other side a new person. And best of all - save, organic, you can grow them in your closet. Fuck yes.&nbsp; But serously, the BEST sex I have ever had in my life has been on shrooms. <br /><br />oddly, alcohol kinda blows in comparison to all those. funny that it&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s legal in the US, huh?

				My mood changes often, but I do have favorites in each class:<br />Psychedelics I&#039;ll take DMT as my favorite when smoked, but LSD holds a dear place in my heart.<br />Entactogens of course MDMA, I like MDA but it gives me serious mindfuck to the point I find it difficult to form sentances. <br /><br />As for my preferred VICE, cocaine via IV injection. I haven&#039;t had this in many years, but there is nothing about that high I dislike, except for coming down ;)<br /><br />And my favorite daily habit is beer. I love good beer, even without a buzz I just really really love a good imported or microbrewed beer.

				I haven&#039;t tried all of them, but out of all the ones that I have done,Lsd. It is just so goddamn pleasant to drop them and then go about your day. I find that it also makes me sociable, I made a lot of friends on LSd. :)
