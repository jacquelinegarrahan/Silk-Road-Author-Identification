				Now that BTC&#039;s are selling in the 70&#039;s and SR using the weighted average of $142.31 You can essentially buy anything for half price.<br /><br />In other words customers can spend BTC&#039;s as if they are worth $142+ when in reality the vendors are receiving BTC&#039;s that are really only worth $70!<br /><br />I had to take down my Coke until the par and weighted prices are closer together. because I can&#039;t sell it for HALF PRICE!<br /><br />It&#039;s like somebody paying you with nickles and you have to count them as dimes!<br /><br />First we loose our asses on BTC&#039;s and now we are giving away our products.<br /><br />Is this BS or What?<br /><br />SprayMan

				Sellers made a fortune if they kept some BTC over the last while. For instance people were paying when the coins were worth $140 and by the time they finalised the coins were worth $260! <br /><br />But don&#039;t worry, most likely BTC will go up again. The key is to decide if you&#039;re going to take a chance and wait it out or just cash them in as you get them. Personally I&#039;d wait, they are a limited item and my bet is that they will go back to where they were, if not higher. There will be more crashes in the future, of that I AM sure so just ride with it.
