				Isnt this the forum thread spamming site? Who gives away money for free? unless they bought in real early and have a million to cash out before they go away for good.... <br /><br />How is it they can spam that quickly in the forums when it takes me 2 mins to post a response? Do you not need ADMIN power to post like they do?<br /><br />SO who would have the ability to spam over 200 messages simultaneously? Who would have enough coin to give them away for bonus money? If the site could be who I think it could be the question becomes... What will happen once they have sold all their coins and have way more cash then hey will ever need.....? <br /><br />bye bye SR?
