				I don&#039;t mind a captcha system, but the rules and image need to be clear.&nbsp; Maybe show the rules next to it.<br />Like, is this captcha case-sensitive?<br />No it isn&#039;t, after some testing.<br /><br />Also the whole 0O lI1 thing is kind of shitty.&nbsp; The font makes it hard to tell the difference between numbers and letters.

				The end is in sight fella, when you reach 100 posts the captcha vanishes.

				It&#039;s just a suggestion.&nbsp; Sure, you can search for answers to anything, it just makes good business sense to spoon feed the customer as much as you can so you don&#039;t have to talk to stupid people.<br />They could just put a little note under the captcha (NOT Case Sensitive).<br />All captchas are inherently shitty to read, I can suck that up.

Why we have it in first place. But yes, catchpas are Case Sensitive. Always.

				I&#039;m not sure which captcha everyone here is referring to, but the one you have to enter before you leave a post is NOT case sensitive.
