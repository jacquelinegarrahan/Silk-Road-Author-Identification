				Title: <strong>Bitcoin question</strong><br />

				I am new to SR, been reading a lot of reviews about vendors, details regarding security and what not. I feel confident to place an order however there is one thing that seems like the biggest hassle to me and that is Bitcoins. What is the easiest way to get bitcoins into my account, I don&#039;t mind paying a bit more to cut out some of the hassle. I have seen some vendors on here sell them for cash cards and have thought of going that route. Any help is greatly appreciated. I only wish I found the road sooner.

				Avoid Mt.Gox other than there are plenty of online btc markets<br /><br />bitcoin.de<br />btc-e.com<br /><br />many users buy locally<br /><br />for a small time buyer you can safely transfer them directly to SR as its way too much effort for LE to track everyone down...

				Thanks for the responses.<br />I kind of figured that was the case, unfortunately due to my location I am not sure that would be an option.

				If you&#039;re in the US the easiest anonymous way is via Blut Sky Traders : http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re the best way to get coins for SR users. You only need to email them and then make a cash deposit at a bank of America, which is basically filling out a form and giving cash (no names required).<br /><br />If you&#039;re not in the US there&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;localbitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp;that&#039;s what people meant by buying locally. On that site you can find bitcoin sellers near you and arrange for a meeting at a public wifi place like starbucks.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind linking your bank account to a bitcoin exchange there&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;bitstamp.net&nbsp; &nbsp;it requires no ID verification at all but your bank account will be linked to it unless you manage to pay with an anonymous prepaid debit card or have someone else wire the funds there. Bitstamp is the best exchange IMO, I don&#039;t really like bitcoin.de or BTC-e.
