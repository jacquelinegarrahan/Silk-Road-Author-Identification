				I just took my first bareback look around the main forum &amp; saw this.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if anyone has heard of this before, but there is a site (http://silkroadxmx45vk4.onion) which looks just like the silk road login, except it also asks you for your PIN. This is obviously a scam to hijack accounts.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124723.0<br /><br />

				Yeah really the best way to ensure you&#039;re at the actual site is just to memorize the address..

				I had read a cleaver acronym that had to do with a 5&quot; pizza and some such, but I have found it easier to keep it in notebook and paste and post it every time.

				Yeah I actually fell for that before, myself. The day I signed up for my account, it automatically logged me in, so I forgot what the login page even looked like. I don&#039;t know how I found it the first time, I think it was from the Hidden Wiki, but the next time I attempted that I fell for it. I ended up changing my PIN and password after I realized what happened. Fortunately, as well, I had no money, transaction records, messages, or anything but I could see how it could be a real problem if you did in fact have money on there. They trick you into giving them your PIN and then withdraw all your funds. I think.
