				Have downloaded this program, and all seems smooth except my knowledge of how this works! I&#039;ve read quite a few other topics, maybe I&#039;m missing a step by step &quot;GPG for dummies&quot; thread. I see keys of others, different lengths. Using GP4WIN and looking at the main tab titled GNU Privacy Assistant, how does one use another&#039;s key to message them? Also, how does one better secure themselves? This second question is in reference to someone saying a number in the upwards of 1000+ is more safe. Newbie lost in the woods, any wise words would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time. :D

				I use the method described on this guide<br /><br />http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-3-making-an-order/<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t get gpg and kleopatra to work, and this method seemed much simpler. I&#039;ve used it a few times now with no issues.

				Go to YouTube and type in &quot;How to use PGP Encryption&quot;, then waltz on over to the Newbie PGP Club stickied at the top of this forum to practice.

				http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Here&#039;s an onion link for GPG4USB with indepth details on how to do everything you&#039;d need to regarding it. The only problem I had was with exporting my key to the clipboard provided so I exported it to a .txt file and copied that. I&#039;m also not sure on if changing the keysize from 2048 to 4096 will do anything negative in regards to messages between people, hence my posting in the newbie PGP guide (also the fact that I&#039;m new, but it&#039;s best to get things in order before purchasing)

				It shouldn&#039;t do anything negative, since every PGP program that I&#039;ve seen can work with 4096 bit keys.<br /><br />It&#039;s not really necessary, though. 2048 bit keys should be safe for a couple of decades. I just figured, why not?<br />

Was extremely useful where other guides using GPG4Win and Kleopatra were not. Thanks for the information about keysize as well, I didn&#039;t think it would make much difference but not having used PGP before I figured it&#039;d be better to try it out while also testing my PGP abilities as well.
