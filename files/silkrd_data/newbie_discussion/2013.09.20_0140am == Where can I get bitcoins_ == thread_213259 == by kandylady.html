				I use MoneyPakTrader.com. He&#039;s also a vendor here if you prefer to deal with through SR. Pretty simple and quick to just buy a MoneyPak. Only downside is that his rates are crazy high, especially if you&#039;re dealing in small increments. Guess with BitInstant gone people can get away with charging so much.

				Local bitcoins seems good. super easy to sign up, no photo id&#039;s etc needed to buy coins. I haven&#039;t bought any from there yet but seems like the best place to buy imo. good rates too. about Â£80 per coin.

Yeah, pretty crazy, but I guess you&#039;re paying for the convenience. Anyone know of anyone reliable that takes Green Dots at a better rate?

				Try localbitcoins.com. You get the BTC only after the seller receives the money on his account. With SEPA it can take 2 days max.

				I got to say, as unbelievable as it may sound, getting the damn bitcoins is a bigger hassle than buying stuff off of the road (which has been an great experience thus far).&nbsp; Pretty sad that we have a wonderful decent community here (for the most part obviously) that I trust more than the supposedly legitimate companies I get bitcoins from.&nbsp; I was using an exchange here in the US that seemed to be pretty stress free, but just this week they no longer accept deposits (have no idea why).&nbsp; Every where else I look (localbitcoins, mt gox etc.) have ridiculous prices (140 +), the exchange I was getting them on were around 125.&nbsp; Sadly the hassle of getting bitcoins may limit me enjoyment of the road.
