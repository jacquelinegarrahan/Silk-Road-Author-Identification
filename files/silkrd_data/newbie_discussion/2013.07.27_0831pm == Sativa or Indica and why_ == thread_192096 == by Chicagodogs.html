				I prefer Sativa. It&#039;s a more functional, cerebral thing. I can play my guitar and I don&#039;t feel like loafing around.<br /><br />However, if you are susceptible to anxiety. Indica is probably the way to go. <br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t enjoy being couch locked.

				It depends, I like them both depending on the situation. Sativas for more of a lighter, soaring, sociable, still able to hike or do other activities kind of high. But there&#039;s nothing like a good indicia for sitting and relaxing, watching movies, listening to music, that kind of thing.

				sativa is nice smoking during the day, when you still need to get some stuff done, indica is great for after work, and your ready to chill out / relax :)<br /><br />basically , they&#039;re both good :D

				Sativa, it makes me want to garden, write, clean the house, walk the dogs, basically just do something and I feel great while doing it. Indica only if I&#039;m using it to come down from something or if I have a day with nothing to do and just want to eat and watch movies or tv.

				I like indica a lot and I am not all that fond of lots-of-THC-and-no-CBD cannabis. I really like bicycling, playing games, working or whatever, completely stoned. Or being outside, watching the rain fall or just listening to music at home or falling asleep.

				I&#039;m undecided on this... I like sativa because the mindfuck is interesting and I get pretty cool CEVs, but sometimes it makes me really paranoid. I like indica since it gets me all relaxed but it makes me a bit too sleepy sometimes. I usually stick to hybrids.

				I don&#039;t have too much trouble with either straight sativas or indicia, but for some reason if I was smoking a lot of sativa, then I switch over to an indicia, I go through a &#039;transition period&#039; with some really strange thought patterns until it &#039;settles in&#039;.

				Sativas are my favorite.&nbsp; I like to be active so its really great to get a good sativa rip before a mountain bike ride.&nbsp; <br />I like Indicas too when you feel like going to an all you can eat buffet, pigging out, and then going into comatose on the couch afterwards.

				Indica the main reason I smoke is so I can get a good nights rest, I have onset insomnia and anxiety issues so sativa isn&#039;t really good for me. I don&#039;t mind couch lock as long as I&#039;m at home relaxing. I prefer to be sober in social events anyways, maybe sativa would be good for a hike or bike ride. :D

				It really depends on what I&#039;m doing at the time.<br /><br />Sativa&#039;s tend to bring out my creative side and allow me to get on with everyday tasks without being sedated. Perfect for a wake and bake :)<br /><br />I usually smoke a strong Indica in the late afternoon or before bed as it tends to relax my muscles and minimize the amount of thoughts rushing around my head.

				I have to go with Sativa.&nbsp; It gives me that &quot;cerebral&quot; high.&nbsp; When I was a young stoner Sativa was mostly what we smoked, Indica was a rare treat, and cost extra too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve given both a good run and Sativa is my choice.

				Sativa mostly because then I can keep operating and getting things done all day<br /><br />Indica to unwind <br /><br />Hybrids can be best of both worlds if I find the right strain
