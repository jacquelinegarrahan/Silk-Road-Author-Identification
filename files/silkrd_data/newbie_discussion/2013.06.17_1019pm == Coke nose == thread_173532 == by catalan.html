				God knows this question has probably been asked a hundred times before, but I think my circumstances may be slightly peculiar and I suspect there are some pretty knowledgeable people on here who can help.<br /><br />I had rhinoplasty some years ago, before which I remember taking cocaine without problem.&nbsp; Ever since, my reaction to (the undoubtedly terribly cut) street coke which I have bought has been extreme: I invariably suffer severe rhinitis (totally blocked sinuses + constant stream of fluid dripping from my nose) for TWO WEEKS irrespective of the amount I take.&nbsp; Just a small bump in one nostril will leave me unable to breathe through my dripping nose for a fortnight.&nbsp; Overall, the experience is so bad that I tend to avoid coke as much as possible.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried various remedies, some with greater success than others, including decongestant tablets (pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine) and sprays (xylometazoline).&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried a lukewarm saline spray shortly after insufflating cola.<br /><br />Strangely, I don&#039;t suffer these effects if I sniff other drugs (ket, meph, etc).<br /><br />I&#039;ll see if the purer stuff available on SR makes a difference, but I fear it may well be the vasoconstrictive properties of the cola itself at play which could leave me bang out of luck.<br /><br />I know that my rhinoplasty surgeon used cocaine to manage bleeding during the operation, and he did ask whether I used recreationally before operating (I said that I did not).&nbsp; I wonder whether something he did, accidentally or deliberately, has caused this reaction?&nbsp; Or perhaps the rhinoplasty itself has changed my sinuses in such a way that they cannot handle much vasoconstriction (I do occasionally get congested without using cola, possibly more often than before the op).<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering whether it&#039;s worth going back to him and seeking help... though I&#039;m really not sure how I can describe the problem!&nbsp; Whilst no doubt many of his patients use coke, I don&#039;t think I want to tell him that&#039;s my problem!<br /><br />Your thoughts much appreciated, either on remedies that I should try or on what may have happened to my nose?

				have you tried mixing the coke with some water, and putting it in a empty Afrin bottle?<br />Have you ever IV&#039;ed. I do and it is the best, but it can get away from you.....be very very careful ;D but it is the bomb ;D ;D ;D ;D

				Creating coke-based nasal spray - no, I haven&#039;t tried it (although it has been recommended to me before).&nbsp; I shall give it a go.<br /><br />I&#039;m not one for IV: can&#039;t stand needles; I&#039;m a social user (and I don&#039;t think my social group would look fondly on me shooting up); and I want to avoid letting a casual habit get out of control.<br /><br />As for freebase: forgive my naivety, but does this mean convert to crack then smoke?&nbsp; Most of the above arguments also apply here: I don&#039;t like smoking; I don&#039;t think smoking crack would be acceptable to my friends; and I understand it&#039;s a big step toward an escalating dependency which I&#039;d rather avoid.<br /><br />However, any other alternative routes of administration would be much appreciated.&nbsp; I read a few threads on the clearnet re ingesting cola (i.e. orally) but am unconvinced whether that would just be a waste.

				Well first off, cocaine is probably the worst drug you could be doing considering you had a rhinoplasty. Second, you should absolutely wash your coke with either acetone or ethanol to remove any cuts because you don&#039;t want to be doing more damage than necessary. Lastly, although you said you have used saline sprays, make sure you continue to do so. In my experience, a saline wash after a coke session makes a huge difference. I can comfortably breathe through my nostrils meaning sleep is much easier at night. Leaving coke in your nose dries out your septum, irritating and eventually deviating it. I recommend you go back to your doctor and tell him the truth. Doctor patient confidentiality was made for these exact scenarios and you shouldn&#039;t be afraid to utilize it.<br /><br />Also, taking cocaine orally is definitely a waste. No idea if its true, but I&#039;ve heard it can cause stomach ulcers because of how corrosive it is. Then again, I figure that must be for large quantities because regular coke users ingest a good amount from the drip and it doesn&#039;t seem to be an issue.
