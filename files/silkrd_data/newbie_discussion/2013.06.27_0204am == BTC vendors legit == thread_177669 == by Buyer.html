I sent 2 messages and none have been responded to yet. MrBuddha responds right away, but still nothing from him yet. Maybe starting an account for buying was a stupid idea. Id advise that none of you use moneyhoney or Mrbuddha until I confirm they are legit. I spot so many fake reviews on here its sick. Notice dude buys BTC few hrs ago and they are already in his account. Yet im still getting nothing in my account from same vendor. Ill be back to advertise these vendors when i get my BTCs or ill be back to call out scamming. Real review not a post by a fake account to up someones business. I urge all of you who are thinking of this moneypak to BTC to wait for my outcome.

				@ SlinginCopper, i am on 24 hours now but it was beacuse my first order i placed before, 9am 07/20/13 PST.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure he would honor the deal, which he did, i promise you.<br /><br />Then around 1:00am PST i put through my second RELoadit pak.&nbsp; He says he checks the orders around 9-10am PST, which is about 3 hours over due.&nbsp; But, i mean unless he has 10,000$ BTC&#039;s worth on stock he is gonna get swamped.<br /><br />If you get nerbvous call the number on the back of the card and make sure the ammount you deposited is still there.&nbsp; I check and its been 24+ hours and the money is still there.<br /><br />So no shady business has happened yet.<br /><br />Common MoneyHoney!!! i gotta buy my MDA!!!

				UPDATE <br />MrBuddha - Legit, he answered all my messages almost immediately, moneypak to BTCs in almost exactly at the 48hrs as his listing says. Good man!!<br />moneyhoney - Legit had BTCs in 48hrs. didnt get response to messages but vendor states right in listing messages may not be answered. Good Vendor.<br />For all of you noobs or veterans that hate the hassle of getting BTCs go use these vendors!<br />Real review not a prop for a scam! I might also mention my buyer account had no history, would of been the easiest to rip off. Some vendors do care about their rep, especially these 2! Much appreciated guys, and I hope my reviews will help some of you.<br />Glad I didnt use Ggatz, these 2 are good to go though!

				I got an order with MrBuddha going on 24 hrs. Never used him before. If vicious86 comes back, use him. freemoney, although at a 79 rating, is a little expensive and a tad slow, but certainly legit.

				You should have no worries with MrBuddha. To be exact it took a few more mins than the 48hrs. He answered every message within minutes. You should be good bro! moneyhoney never responded to any messages but shot the BTCs to me so no big deal. Both good vendors.

				Exactly how is paying $60 more and waiting 48hrs easier <br />BTC can fluctuate so much in that time you could easily have to just buy more BTC to place order so wait another 48hrs <br /><br />Nah think ill go with the 10 minute 2% commision way i do it now with no chance of being ripped

				Wow thats messed up. Yes he really came through for me. I havent logged in since the other day and now I see this. I got messages from 2 people also about this. <br />ordered: July 20, 2013, 1:59 am UTC<br />shipped: July 22, 2013, 2:45 am UTC<br />finalized: July 22, 2013, 8:39 pm UTC<br />That was the purchase from MrBuddha.<br />Guess maybe he was building stats when I ordered.......what BS! sucks because I was planning on using him because he had awesome communication. Maybe I should stop playing and start selling BTCs......I wouldnt be able to sleep at night stealing money from innocent people who are trying to either relax or make some money their self. Buying BTCs seems like such a hassle and thats what is keeping most people off of here. did anything by chance ever happen or just a sob story??<br />

				I&#039;m trying to get this out to as many people that I can. I want everyone to realize how big of a scam this actually was (its being way to down played). mrbuddha walked away with A LOT OF CASH, if you have not already contacted MP saying that &quot;somehow your funds have been depleted&quot; then you should. It&#039;s enough money that they might eventually be forced to act. To all those who got scammmed (myself included) you need to understand that there were a couple of very reputable dealers that went rogue this week.<br /><br />My theory: They are all the same guy.... I laugh at the estimates I see (~5-10K). Before he closed his vendor page the day that he turned scammer (7/22/13) there were multiple reviews saying that he had not come through on their orders of greater than $5000 in MPs or BTCs (there was one of $10200). THIS GUY WAS DOING THAT ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS. Not including all the people who have not come forward, this guy walked away with &gt; $60000, I guarantee it. I really think that is a conservative estimate too. <br /><br />It was one hell of a scam on his end. It took 6 months of work to build a reputation and then the big orders starting coming in.... then he sends out the story about his family emergency we all received and he was never to be seen again.
