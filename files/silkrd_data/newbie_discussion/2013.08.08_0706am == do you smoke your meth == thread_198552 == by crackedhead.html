				Wish I could help you, but I would be in the same dilemma as you are if I tried to smoke it since I&#039;m the only one I know that uses Meth.&nbsp; But that burn from snorting is incredible.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I love snorting meth, burns so nice :) Smoking it makes my brain feel funny, like random nodes in the cortex are switching on and off all the time...

				I&#039;ve smoked and snorted, but my personal preference is to just eat it.... It&#039;s slower to come on, but I find it seems to last heaps longer and I quite like that building up feeling. Sort of reminds me of the way a pill feels coming on, just in a much more subtle way. At parties and what not I don&#039;t mind a pipe as its more social. Only snorted meth once, and it felt like my head was going to cave in. Burnt like a mofo! Wouldn&#039;t take it this way again in a hurry,...

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh yeah, I&#039;ve actually never orally dosed meth before, sounds alright though :) How much would you dose at a time? I don&#039;t have much of a tolerance to meth, 40mg line keeps me going nicely for 3-4 hrs.

				TBH I am pretty loose with dosages - I usually weigh my product on arrival, and then just guesstimate from looking at it each dose I take. Last chemical romance I had, was from OZ High - I&#039;d say I had no more than .1g (a point) which kept me awake for about 30 hours give or take

				Now I&#039;m not a person who kbnows anything about meth...Aren&#039;t you supposed to vaporize it, not smoke it for maximum efficiency?
