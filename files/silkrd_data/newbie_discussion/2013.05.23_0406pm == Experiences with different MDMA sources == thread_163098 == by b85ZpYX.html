				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have done MDMA a handful of times, and never have I been to have an experience similar to my first. The first time I did it, it was very &#039;mind-blowing,&#039; &#039;eye opening,&#039; and other similar adjectives. <br /><br />I feel this could largely have been due to the setting and the nature of the first experience, but at the same time that first drug trip felt different from the others. <br /><br />Could I have done an MDMA analogue my first time? Or possibly just a certain mix of impure MDMA?

				Many factors at play. The first time is always magical though but it&#039;s hard to say why your experiences are like they are.

				I think the setting of MDMA experience matters much more than the purity or source of the MDMA!

				Let me bring up a quote I read here a while ago.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only way I know to avoid loss of magic and depressive symptoms is to be moderate in dosage, frequency and contexts.<br />&nbsp;To leave MDMA for special occasions and not to make it an habit. This could sound obvious, but I think it is not only a question of neurorreceptors. It is much easier.<br />Suppose that you like Disneyworld. The first time you go you will think it is fantastic but, if you go every weekend you will finally get fed up of White Snow and Donald Duck.<br />&nbsp;Properties of MDMA are so specific that if you use it too frequently it makes you bored. I think it is also important not to expect too much from it, I mean,<br />&nbsp;some people get obsessed with &quot;getting high&quot; as the first times and that conditions the experience. It is also important, in my opinion,<br />&nbsp;to realize and think about some effects of MDMA that can be learn during the experience, but applicable to everyday life.<br />Someone told me that the first time you take MDMA is similar to &quot;learn to read&quot;.<br />&nbsp;Once you have done it, your perception of reality (and your perceptions of further MDMA experiences) changes. You can´t learn to read twice, and, in this sense,<br />&nbsp;the first experiences will be different to the rest. But you can still enjoy the substance if you are cautious in the way of use and don´t expect too much.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
