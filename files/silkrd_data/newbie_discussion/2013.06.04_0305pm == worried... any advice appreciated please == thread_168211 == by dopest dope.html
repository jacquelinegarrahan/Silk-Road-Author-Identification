				Hi all,<br /><br />I made my first order over silkroad which all went successful. About a few days to a week later I received mail completely unrelated to SR that had evidently been ripped apart and put back together almost. Coincidence? I hope so... it has played on my mind and thus I haven&#039;t yet made another order. Could my first order potentially have been seized and let go? perhaps in the hope of me ordering increased amounts and then being subject to the police? or was this merely coincidence such as the original sender making a mistake on my mail and thus having to re-open it and re seal it. <br /><br />Note: the SR order was international. The mail that &#039;appeared&#039; to have been open and resealed was through domestic mail.<br /><br />Any advice or opinions about this would be appreciated.

				Well I&#039;m no expert on that but my take is that if LE finds something illegal they seize it right there, right then. Hence the name contraband especially with customs, especially with drugs. They don&#039;t just let it go through and see what happens next they seize it and send a letter to the person it was to go to.<br /><br />The only exception to this would be if LE is after a big time dealer or large supplier which you are not. They would let it go through to find out who the big fish are.<br /><br />I have no idea whats going on and you may want to stay low at least go domestic for a bit go with your gut but to me it sounds like the two are unrelated.

				Depends on what it was...<br /><br />An ounce of heroin is not gonna ever get to ur hands if customs sees it (theyll CD you if anything)<br />a g of weed isnt worth their time...<br /><br />Try an use domestic shipping as often as possible:)

				Mate, the second letter you received, if Domestic, wouldn&#039;t have been opened and inspected as it didn&#039;t go through Customs or contain any illegal products. I just can&#039;t see any reason whatsoever why it would be opened, especially being a Domestic package.<br />Your International order would have been the one to be opened as it passed through Customs from another country. Thankfully that didn&#039;t happen.<br />I can&#039;t see any reason why you can&#039;t keep ordering to the same address. If you&#039;re really worried, try sending yourself a package approx. the same weight and size as the one opened, and see if you receive it as you normally would. IMO, you can just order like normal!&nbsp; :)

It its domestic, it was probably accidently &quot;opened&quot; by way of a rainy day in transit combined with mail handling machinery which took a bite out of it.<br /><br />Without seeing it, it is hard to say. Just trying to make you feel a little better.

				Brother, if it had been opened for investigation it would have been resealed so that you would not have known you were being watched.<br /><br />It was most likely damaged in transit, relax.&nbsp; :)

				&quot;Try an use domestic shipping as often as possible:)&quot;<br /><br />Wise words from a wise man I think everyone should follow this advice. I never thought shipping this kind of thing through International Borders and Customs is ever a good idea. It&#039;s a unnecessary risk, I don&#039;t care how much you save.

				sadly it&#039;s pretty normal. happens to me a couple of times a year. Sometimes it&#039;s rough handling from the post office and sometimes it&#039;s a neighbor that accidentally opens it and returns it.
