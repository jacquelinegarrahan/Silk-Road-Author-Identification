				I&#039;d just like to say I&#039;m glad to be here and I hope I can learn and become a valuable part of this awesome community so I can give back one day and keep the circle healthy. I&#039;m a member on a few other boards. None like this one I must say lol! I&#039;m very new to Bitcoin and Sr. I just placed my first order for btc through jumbomonkeybiscuit. It was a somewhat small one so I can familiarize myself with how things work. I can&#039;t wait to start ordering ;-) I read all positive reviews about the vendor so hopefully they&#039;ll be added to my account soon and off I go. Thanks for having me and if there&#039;s anything I can do to contribute or help just lemme know, <br />Bigtruck

It&#039;s good to see some pro-social behavior around here. I think thats one of the nice things about SR is that the anon status allows people to quit with the fronts. People don&#039;t have to act tough to get their DOC.

				Thanks everyone for the welcome!&nbsp; Awesome my first karma rating was a good one lol!! My positive attitude isn&#039;t going anywhere that&#039;s for sure ;-) the sooner we realize we dictate how we feel and how we feel dictates who&#039;s attracted to us and ends up in our lives somehow&nbsp; the better haha. Got no time to waste being neggy! Lolol thanks again guys <br />Bigtruck
