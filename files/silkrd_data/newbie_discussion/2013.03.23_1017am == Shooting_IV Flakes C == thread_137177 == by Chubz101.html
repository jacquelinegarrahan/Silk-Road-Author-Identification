				Hello guys. I`ve just got some flakes for the first time and dont jnow how to prepare it for IV. Untill now i have always bought C in powder(HCL) form that dissolved in water and was ready to bang. Now this flakes C that i got will not dissolve no matter what i do. I even added some citric in case it was crack/FB but the results were almost the same.<br /><br />I`m really in need of some help.

				Well, since no one replied and in case someone gets into the same situation, let me answer my question.<br />I GOT SCAMMED and got God knows what instead of &quot;1 Gram Pure Cocaine Flakes ____ Uncut&quot;. What i can say with 100% certainty is that there was no coke in it at all - absolutely NONE. It did not dissolve in water like C does - and i did not feel a thing. I IVed 0.5G of that crap and felt nothing. If that would have been pure coke, like the vendor still claims it is, i would now be six feet under.<br />Well, lesson learned. Stick to my usual trusted vendors, like C63amg &amp; FM.

				Yeah that sucks. def not coke if it wont dissolve. 1ml of water should dissolve 1800 to 2500mg of cocaine. It is very soluble in water. Name the rat dog&nbsp;

				Guys i am still in contact with the vendor so i wont crucify him by telling who he is and also do not have the heart to potentially ruin someones business without trying to solve things in a civil manner first.<br /><br />I`d like to know/hear your opinion on this matter, because everything except the C was perfect, and something just does not feel right about all this. The contact, processing, shipping were all perfect and extremely fast and the package was very well packed -Double vacuumed + put into something as an extra precaution and to make it look like its something common sent via post. <br /><br />- Do you guys think i was selectively scammed? My opinion so far was that i was scammed but now i am starting to doubt it, since it does not make sense that a reputable vendor would scam me for less than 2 BTC, when i told him I`d be purchasing 5 or 10g`s if the C is any Good. And my stats by itself tell i meant business: 6 months member, 16transactions, and over 160BTC spent. Everything else at 0%<br /><br />-Or could it just be that the coke was crushed off a part of a brick that had just cut in it. It happened to me once before with one of my sellers of choice and he handled it like a gentleman and as an apology sent me some extra with my next purchase.<br /><br />I cant think of any other explanation. What do you guys think? Some of his answers are out of this world. Like he doesnt know what real C is or thinks i am a young/naive. I would not blame him for thinking the latter, because my writing is not reflective of my age when i am high. <br /><br />Oh and the vendor still whines for destroying his reputation, even though i left him a 5 out of 5 and did not name him.<br /><br /><br />Sorry guys, if you did not understand some parts - just point them out and i will do my best to explain. I am high kite right now. Have a glass with approx.. 100ml of water and 3g`s of C dissolved in it so i just keep shooting without a break.<br /><br />Regards<br />Chubz101<br />

				Forgot to add - if you are buying some C and want to be sure you are not buying from this person, just PM me with the vendors name you want to buy from, and i`ll say if its OK.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for your support guys.
