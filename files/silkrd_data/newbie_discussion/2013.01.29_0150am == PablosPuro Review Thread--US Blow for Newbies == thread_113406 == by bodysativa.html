				It&#039;s a shame that the above post is the only post in pablos review thread here, so here&#039;s one more:<br /><br />My package from Pablo came in today. ordered Thursday, arrived Monday. Way ahead of what I expected after reading reviews and even his own words on his page. Now listen, I may have mentioned but will again, that I&#039;m no coke head/ aficionado/expert, and haven&#039;t done it in years. I like it too much...&nbsp; but I&#039;ve done some good coke in the past. I&#039;ve never tested any or had it tested, but was getting it from a good, reliable source. This shit from pablo is as good or better, at least on the surface. I&#039;d love to see a test on pablos, and maybe I will soon, but I&#039;m high as shit off one little bump, and it smells/tastes/feels the part. It weighed on the spot, and was as stealthy as it needed to be. I don&#039;t know much about all this SR bad coke business and all that, but I can tell you that this is what passes for good coke in my neck of the woods, and at this price I&#039;ll be back for more.

				Ive ordered twice from the dude<br /><br />The first order the coke was awesome, top 3 ive ever done, darkexpresso also had some fire.<br /><br />The second order, it was a ball, it wasn&#039;t very good, made all my friends sick and actually throw up, burnt my nose pretty bad. I then messaged hi, kindly and told him that, and he never even replied. Im not ordering from him again
