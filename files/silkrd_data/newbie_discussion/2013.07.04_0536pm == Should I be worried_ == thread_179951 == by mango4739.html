				Hi chaps!<br />I&#039;ve placed an order for 7g of cheese from Mr. Bud UK. I noticed he was a new vendor but thought everyone&#039;s got to start somewhere - right? I&#039;ve only done a few transactions myself so thought I&#039;d give him a chance.<br />The thing is, since I placed my order 3 days ago he hasn&#039;t been seen. Also he now has &#039;no active listings&#039;.<br />Fortunately I haven&#039;t finalised yet but do you guys think I should be worried. I mean there&#039;s hardly going to be a full scale police operation for some bloke trying to by a 1/4 of weed is there!!<br />It just seems strange - and I really want my Blue Cheese!!&nbsp; :P<br />What do you guys think?

				Ciao Mango! <br />So... no, I wouldn&#039;t be worried, but I would; however, cancel it once the option becomes available to you. I just posted a situation very similar on the &quot;New Coke Vendor&quot; thread. Just cancel it! It will make you feel better and simply avoid any future issues. <br /><br />To date I&#039;ve only used vendors with a 99+ rating and haven&#039;t been disappointed. The new one I tried failed so he/she is now eliminated from the &quot;go-to&quot; list.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Well if you are worried you can cancel your order and he wont have your address because he was never logged in to see it before you cancelled. :P

				Sometimes we tend to over think these situations. People do go on vacation, sometime real life stuff does come up. We cant be on SR 24/7

				Good points from each of you - thanks.<br />I think I&#039;ll cancel the order when the option becomes available and buy from someone else.<br />Trouble is my stocks are running low, i hoped to have it by now!!!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />I&#039;ll order some more from a different vendor,<br /><br />Cheers!

				Mango: <br />Once you cancel you will feel much better about the whole thing!... honestly! <br />Depending on what you were ordering I have some really great peeps that haven&#039;t disappointed so far... PM if you want to know. I&#039;m MORE than happy to help. <br /><br />It sucks being the newb and not knowing who to go to or who you can count on. That said, NEVER trust that anyone is on the up and up BUT, there are a few that seem to be consistent. I&#039;ll pass on the info, if you like. <br /><br />IMHO consistency is the key!!<br /><br />D~
