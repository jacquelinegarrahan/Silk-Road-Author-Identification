				Since us newbies are stuck here for a while, I thought I&#039;d try and spark up a conversation and get some stories rolling! :)<br /><br />I was about thirteen or fourteen years old and I went out with some friends and one had a score of&nbsp; Soapbar (which is shitty hash for those who don&#039;t know), he started to crumble the hash over some tobacco in a joint, rolled it then said to us &quot;Right who&#039;s up for a toke?&quot; Everyone including me said yes even though I&#039;d never seen weed/hash before or knew anybody that had been stoned. We ended up playing a game of &quot;Indian&quot; where all the people make a circle, take X amount of tokes, and pass it along, holding the smoke in until the joint gets back to you, and repeat until it&#039;s finished. I can remember holding in the smoke and thinking it tasted like utter shit, if you&#039;ve had really bunk Soapbar, you&#039;ll know what I mean. It got me pretty stoned though, haha!<br /><br />Anyway i&#039;m too lazy to write more atm so that was my first illegal drug experience, it&#039;s nothing special but it&#039;s made me into the drug fiend I am today.. (hurray!) hahaha. <br /><br />Feel free to share your own! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				haha soap-bar wasn&#039;t as bad when I was a kid, we always got Red or Gold Seal. My first experience was a joint of red at 13. I stole the joint from my fathers stash and smoked it through a milk bottle haha. My mate took a few tokes and passed it back saying how horrible it was so I smoked most of it like that trying to show off and the rest without the bottle. I remember being sick for at least 3 days and swore I&#039;d never smoke again. I did though when I turned 18 and I&#039;ve been enjoying it ever since :)

				Weed was first.<br />First smoked in locker room(after football practice) in high school.<br />This guy who we bought from got rich or made a really good living(i know its high risk) just from selling<br />toothpick joints at school.<br />He sold half ounces from his apartment thru a steel door with<br />a small sliding metal slot.<br />He had a super flush toilet right in the middle of his living room.<br />The cops could never bust him. They tried to bust in a couple times<br />but he only kept a certain amount and always flushed it before they got in other wise place was clean.<br />It was just his business apartment.<br /><br />he had a couple houses in puerto rico.<br />years later they finally busted him bringing in a shipment.<br />I happened to see him at that time it was a few years later and not dealing with him anymore.<br />But was he in bad shape.<br />The cops beat the shit out of him he had 2 black eyes broken nose in a collar with a cane.<br />They had a vendetta because he always beat them.<br />He was going to sue the cops. Moved after that dont know what happened.<br /><br />After weed it was really what was around as far as local drugs.<br />I used to have alot of THC tablets(about valium size but orange color and little thicker. could smoke em too!) at the time and mescaline tabs the real small ones(purple or blue) did over 20 one night not all at once but was i trippin. Blotter acid.There aint nothin better than trippin outside in a dark area with lights in the distance on a nice cool evening with buds/chicks and some beer and bones.<br />This was during high school.<br />After high school<br />It was crank and this powered/crystal THC is what they called it.<br />All i know that a dime of this was potent and would kick your ass if you drank.<br />If you wanted to travel abit<br />there was angel dust, window pane acid and just about anything you wanted.<br /><br />Of course there was always smack.<br />But from our gang/clique three people died of aid before I left that scene.<br />One got aids from sharing needles in a shooting gallery and then he hung himself, a girl who shared needles and a guy Big John I was younger but I hung out a bit with him. Showed me how to make a prison tattoo gun and other prison stuff. This guy was a big strong muther fuker. He was a shriveled up mess when he died.<br />Dont shoot if you can help it.<br />If not there is no reason to share needles these days.<br />If you have to reuse your own use bleach and rinse with alcohol.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Alcohol at age 13 (I think?)<br />That pretty much started my escapades <br /><br />I know alcohol isn&#039;t illegal but I was underage. So it was illegal.<br /><br />But after alcohol, soon came cigarettes and then weed... and then everything else.

				Some girl in 7th grade gave me a joint once. I &quot;smoked&quot; it in my basement after school, but it wasn&#039;t until I was around 17 that I really got into smoking. I also learned I enjoyed opiates very much. I snorted my fair share of heroin in high school, never got addicted. Now I only smoke weed but I&#039;d be open to doing opiates again.

				My first experience was some benzos when I was 11, I never as good before as at that time. It was in the hospital before surgery though so it&#039;s not really illegal and unfortunately I don&#039;t know what substance they gave me, it was really euphoric and better than all benzos I&#039;ve had since. Maybe it&#039;s because I was so young.<br /><br />My first real illegal drug experience was weed at the age of 13 or maybe alcohol I don&#039;t remember which came first.

				I started late... I was about 29 when I tried some MDMA and that was a year ago. I fell in love with this stuff immediately and now I can&#039;t go out partying without it. The idea of using just alcohol makes me feel bored.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />However, during this year I&#039;ve tried MDMA, speed, cocaine and chrystal meth. So basically things got a bit out of hand as you might imagine.&nbsp; 8) But now I&#039;m only using MDMA again and I feel good and healthy. I only use it when I&#039;m out partying of course.<br /><br />My last cocaine experience was very nice though. My friend gave me a couple of lines of 30-40% cocaine and I liked it alot - it was very good for partying also. So I&#039;m thinking of getting some of that good stuff from SR. I have to be careful though since the stuff from silkroad should be more potent.

				Me and some friends decided to smoke weed for our first time freshman year of highschool. Looking back we absurdly indiscreet. We went to a public park and posted up under a bridge with a path going through that bikers, runners, and people walking by used. I remember taking my first hit (out of a homemade plastic bottle bong) and as I exhaled a man on roller skates nearly ran in to me. I screamed and then realized I was already high as fuck. Never been that high since. I also remember to going to McDonalds to cure my very first case of the munchies and taking about 5 minutes to order because I couldn&#039;t stop laughing. <br />SInce then, I went through a long period of being in love with uppers. Started by buying prescription amps from friends at school and dabbled with coke a few times. These days I feel like my love for uppers has gone away, mostly because I used so many my first year of college to get work done, and ended up being strung out and failed out cause I loved talking to people and chain smoking instead of actually doing work while I was on them. One of my first purchases off the road as a gram of speed. After doing it all in a night, I came to the conclusion that my obsession with uppers is going to leave me down a lot more than up. So fortunately, I think I&#039;d say I&#039;m over that phase. Now I&#039;m more into things that have long-term benefits. Psychedelics have done a great job of this, I love the introspection. Right now, one of my favorite new drugs is MXE, a ketamine analogue that basically is an elongated K experience. I still haven&#039;t tried actual K but plan to get some of the road pretty soon. <br />Anyways, I got a little of topic but hey, it was cool to write this down and relive the good an bad times. :)

				I took two or three puffs off a J when I was 12 and then we rode our bikes around. I went in to a store and saw an indien guy and wanted to tell him that I felt great from smoking weed, but I didn&#039;t. I just smiled, walked around and left to ride somemore. LSD at 17, Dro 27, Salvia 28, Mushrooms 28:)

				It was college, the year 2009. There were five of us having just bought marijuana. We knew we couldn&#039;t smoke it so we were forced to cook with it, melting it down into butter to be baked into cookies for a party that very eve. Several private officers and I finally produced a batch of little cookies. We all took one, wondering where the night would lead. We headed down to a campus-hosted event.<br /><br />We all kind of went into different directions, seeing people we knew and drifting away from one another. The night took a most magically inhaled spin upside down. The trees grew and shrank in time. There were lapses of the evening. One moment I was standing next to the gazebo listening to a young Joshua sermonize the crowd. The next moment I was meeting a girl, Adrienne, and was thoroughly disinterested in her chunky calf muscles.<br /><br />The giggles hit me. People wondered? Was he? Is he? But what? And who?<br /><br />I was anonymous then. Much less than I am now though. It was a hard fight to become a nobody but marijuana helped me go in that direction.

				Well my first drug experience came when I was old 17,5 years old.<br /><br />It was weed, and took some time to convince myself that what I did was a nice experience and not something I should be ashamed of.<br /><br />So innocent...<br /><br />But I am really grateful that it took me years before finding all about drugs. Had an awesome childhood hehe

				I was like, well young. Back then there was a lot of BS about people who couldn&#039;t get high from weed. I had tried and tried about 10 times to get high from it with no luck. I was scared I was one of those.<br />Then one night at work I was given a joint during dinner. At the same time this guy was telling a joke. I was sitting, toking and listening. I didn&#039;t notice until the punchline when I feel from my seat in hysterics. I had never laughed so much or felt like that. I was Taken home by my foreman. <br />Turns out that smoking leaf was a total waste of lung.<br />I bought a tie stick of my work mate when I got back and haven&#039;t looked back since.<br />

But then when the giggle phase ended I started to enjoy just smoking it to relax and chill out! :)
