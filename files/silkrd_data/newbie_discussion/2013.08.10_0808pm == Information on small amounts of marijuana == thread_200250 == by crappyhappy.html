				I&#039;m pretty new around here and I&#039;m having a bit of a problem finding information relating to what I&#039;m interested in. I&#039;ve been looking at some of the vendors that sell small amounts of MJ (I&#039;m really only interested in either a gram or an eighth) and quite a few of them seem to have good reviews, such as QualityKings, WalMart, DOPE man, ect. However, some of the guides from the Silk Road subreddit highly recommend checking the forums for reviews on any specific vendor. I&#039;ve seen some of the threads under the &#039;rumor mill&#039; section, but those have hundreds of pages. Is there an efficient way to find specific reviews of the vendor in the amounts I&#039;m looking for? Or do I just need to work backwards through some of the review threads and hope that I can find what I&#039;m looking for?<br /><br />On a related note, QualityKings&#039; profile indicates that they&#039;ve only started vending again as of 8/8, having stopped sometime in june or july after a bunch of orders fell through. Has anyone had any recent experiences with them?

				hello crappyhappy,<br /><br />We are vending again and would love to have your business. We became a victim of our own success in the past and had issues keeping up with orders. Our customers security has always been the most important thing to us and we take extra measures to protect them and our packages. This makes each package take a lot longer to package than usual. Till this date we have not lost a single package, We got busy and didn&#039;t send out a few packages in the past and refunded everyone for it. We have since restructured our model and have had zero issues since we have been back up.&nbsp; We have also added a lot of new items.<br /><br />If you have any further questions please let us know, if you do place an order make sure you send me a message and I will throw in a nice gift for you as well<br /><br />enjoy thyself<br />-qk<br />

				Hey, Thanks for the reply! I&#039;ll definitely check out your vendor page ASAP. It&#039;s really great to see a vendor going out of their way to help out a noob on the site.

				I can vouch for quality kings.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered a few times in the past couple of weeks without a hitch.&nbsp; In fact, they are one of the quickest vendors I&#039;ve dealt with and the stealth for the edibles I&#039;ve been receiving has been excellent.&nbsp; They were also kind enough to toss in a free treat with my order which was cool of them.&nbsp; I know you&#039;re looking for green to smoke, but if you&#039;re into edibles at all I&#039;d recommend trying the cheeba chew.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very effective edible.&nbsp;

				When you&#039;re browsing MJ listings on the road, you can check their vendor profile page. Most vendors will have a link there to a review thread in the rumor mill.
