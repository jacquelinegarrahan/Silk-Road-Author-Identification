				hello every 1,<br /><br />i have a good source of afghan heroin in india, it comes through pakistan to india,<br />i was wondering if people would like to order it from india, i will use the latest packing methods. i can surely beat the current price on SR, <br />i am planing to give away some cheap samples, but i am just waiting for some money to buy the packing equipment... people giving me advice will get the free samples. or else i might charge a little to get my equipment.<br /><br />i wanted to know how parcels are treated from india.<br /><br />if any 1 is intrested in bulk quantities i might start asap.<br /><br />i also want to know how much i will be able to sell. so i will think if&nbsp; i should start. the quality is A1. i do not know the diffrence between No. but i have tried bad heroin so i know what is good heroin, plus my free samples will get me the reviews.<br /><br />waiting this thread to get some attention. if a mod could move this to &quot;products offered thread&quot; i will be really great full.<br /><br />thanks

				think you need to get your supply first before saying you can give out free samples . sounds like you need to do a lot of thinking and doing some work first .<br />people could also think this is a scam

				I&#039;ve received things from India before, i recommend flattening the product into a business letter and have the product sealed for smell.<br />Would love a free sample when you&#039;re all set up.

				I would suggest getting some testing kits if you dont know your H.that way you can post pics of the results next to the batch.<br />as for post,vacuum sealed and as plain looking as you can get with a printed address label so looks like business post.<br />If you do get up and running be sure to pm me.

				Always post pics of your shipping batch with the current date and your vendor name in the picture. When you change the batch change the pic. This will go a long way toward convincing people you&#039;re legit. Sell small sample amounts so people can try your product (e.g. 100mg, 125mg, 250mg, 500mg). Be very careful with your stealth as NA customs are smart MFs. Laplace

You may offer them here and get a list of usernames that want samples, but all address info etc. MUST go through the Silk Road order system.<br /><br />I would recommend offering samples to people here with a relatively high post count and a good history of reviewing products for other vendors - their opinions generally have more weight with the community than the opinions of others where product quality is concerned.<br /><br />State your requirements (previous reviewing experience that they can link you to, minimum number of posts etc.), get people that are interested in samples to post here saying so, post the list of accepted reviewers here, then ask those members to place an order with you through your vendor account for the samples.<br /><br />As already mentioned in a previous post above, ensure that you are only supplying clean product. With heroin and other drugs that people may be injecting this is INCREDIBLY important.<br /><br />Regarding moving this to &#039;Product Offers&#039;, if it is moved you will not be able to post in it until you have 50 posts, and it is technically not a product offer as you do not yet have an account from which to offer products.<br /><br />Libertas

You want your payload to be undetectable even if the envelope is opened (yes, this is doable).<br /><br />(Yes I know you can jam about 5 grams of powder in an envelope but we want to avoid detection.)<br /><br />Your envelope MUST appear professional, laser printed names and addresses only. Never touch the envelope or any contents with your bare hands - always wear gloves (don&#039;t use those really light surgical gloves they pass prints). Make your envelope appear to be from a professional office (lawyer, doctor, engineer).<br /><br />An envelope from India MIGHT get a second look going into Canada and the US. Your stealth needs to get you through.

				It does seem a bit shady that you don&#039;t have the packaging equipment, but you can afford good H, and then want to supply samples so you can pay for said equipment? But if you are legit, the H market is ripe for the taking, esp. because of high prices. Hope to see you on the road soon.

				Be prepared for the transit time from India to different countries. You could see anywhere from 3 days to 14 days. Make sure the customer knows this. Like UptownBrown, above, says - the stealth MUST be untouchable. Never, ever discuss stealth details in a public forum.<br /><br />Good luck.

They&#039;re not ready to start vending, and they represent a real security risk to anybody that may purchase from them if they manage to get set up as a vendor in the first place.<br /><br />If I want to drive a Formula 1 car, having never even driven a car before (the equivalent of this person sending heroin in the mail having never sent an illicit substance in the mail before) I don&#039;t simply walk onto the track in Monaco and say &quot;Hey guys, I&#039;ll take this one, looks fast and I&#039;m sure once I see the inside of the car I&#039;ll be able to control it out on the track and win the Grand Prix!&quot;<br /><br />It really does boil down to exactly that. And I would rather be disliked by a few here than encourage somebody to go ahead sending people things that can a.) kill them if the quality cannot be determined, and b.) get them into huge amounts of trouble with their country&#039;s law enforcement if they cannot even get their packaging down without asking for PICTURES of stealth packaging. Pictures of stealth packaging completely defeats the point of stealth packaging. ???<br /><br />Libertas
