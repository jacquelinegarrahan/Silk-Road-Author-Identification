				Hello, world.&nbsp; I&#039;m very new to the SR so I thought I&#039;d drop in and let my presence be known.&nbsp; I hope to find some reputable vendors eventually but, in the meantime, I&#039;ll be hanging back on the forum.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to spam my way to 50 so feel free to start a discussion, ask a question or just spam in here.&nbsp;

				Hi proxanne!<br />It&#039;s a good thing you decided not to spam, I think the spamming on the newbie boards is pretty annoying. So, to start a discussion I&#039;ll ask.. Do you feel like you&#039;re ready to place an order? Have you learned PGP and gotten bitcoins?

				Sorry for the late reply,&nbsp; I&#039;ve been preoccupied lately.&nbsp; To answer your question though, no.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been reading about the whole process but haven&#039;t practiced the methods yet.&nbsp; For example, I have several PGP tutorials saved that I haven&#039;t read yet.&nbsp; There is a mountain of information, I just haven&#039;t digested it yet!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I agree with the spam thing.&nbsp; I&#039;m new so I would rather take those 50 posts and make them count towards something; introducing myself; asking questions; discussions, etc.&nbsp; If I were to rush into buying something this soon I&#039;m sure I would screw something up. <br />

				Hi proxanne - I&#039;m trying to post some real posts along with some spamz-a-lot to get to 50.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of the other way around; been shopping for quite a while now but didn&#039;t really look to the community much until we had all the technical errors, then took a look around and it looks pretty useful.<br /><br />I&#039;m a techie, so the TOR/PGP etc. was easy, but I was very anxious about first purchase (is this too good to be true?!?), and I probably waited about 6 months after setting up the software and buying the coins to take the plunge. I&#039;ve made several purchases now and all has been very professional.

				Welcome! There were many steps in getting myself onto SR and ready to purchase! Figuring out BC and making a decision on which route to buy/store/etc. Figuring out PGP was tough!! Im not a techie but fairly savy on the net....I think! lol :) But once I got it all figured out its a breeze! And its AMAZING!! :) I found a youtube video helpful but I dont think the guy should have that video available to the masses! When getting PGP program be sure to click box for GPA thats the program you will actually use. There are a bunch of other programs you dont need. Again....Im not super savy w/ this but thats been m experience. <br />GL and Cheers! :)

				PGP is so important when sending your personal info to a vendor for a shipment. Because you are encrypting it just for the vendor no one else can read it. Make sure you do that when you place an order. PGP is your best friend. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				PGP is really easy to use.. I don&#039;t recommend GPG4WIN (gpa), you should go with gpg4usb, it&#039;s a lot easier to use and it&#039;s just all around better. It&#039;s pretty hard at the beginning when you read through those forums, there&#039;s a lot of information here, but it&#039;s important you take time to read on how to be anonymous, not get busted, etc.<br /><br />I hope you&#039;ll get everything set up soon!<br />

				GPG4WIN isn&#039;t less secure but it&#039;s more annoying to use and requires an installation. gpg4usb is just incredibly more easy to use and you can also make stronger keys. GPA only allows you to make 2048bit key while gpg4usb&#039;s maximum is 4096bit. <br />They both do the same thing and GPA is also easy to use but the interface is kind of crappy IMO and it just generally kind of sucks. I prefer programs that don&#039;t require an installation as they don&#039;t leave as many traces on your computer. If your order doesn&#039;t arrive it&#039;s not GPA&#039;s fault, it&#039;s because the vendor scammed you ;)

				Hey guys, this is kinda off topic, but since you&#039;re talking about being scammed I have my share of thoughts to deliver&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m missing something here but I think people finding packages being lost in the mail system something normal and acceptable completely bullshit. <br /><br />Let me make my point. How many times have you had something lost in the mail? I&#039;ll take myself as an example. I use the mail for i don&#039;t know, 20 years? I have NEVER had anything going missing. When traveling and sending postcards they always get there. When sending letters to my granny as a child she would always receive them. I have friends in other countries who occasionally send me a letter just for the fun of it and they always get to me. What about penpal, that was very popular 10 years ago, people would always trust the mail system. I mean... it&#039;s the fucking mail! Why would anyone think something they posted wouldn&#039;t arrive? I think that doesn&#039;t even pop to your head when posting legal stuff. <br /><br />Then suddenly after I sign up to SR mail start to miss their destination?? that&#039;s complete bullshit. Unless your orders are being intercepted by feds or whatever which is REALLY hard to happen (i buy all sort of stuff without paying taxes on ebay all the time), and even if it happens you would probably receive a seizure letter or something (that happened to me with a Kindle I bought once off ebay). So the point is: there is an ongoing &quot;culture&quot; here that it is normal for mail to disappear. Come on, I think 90% of packages not arriving are vendors selectively scamming their clients. I do believe sometimes your order may be detected as something illegal and be stopped by the government but the number of cases like that popping up here is simply too high to be true. <br /><br />See, i&#039;m not complaining about how SR works. Actually I have never had a package missing from SR, and I accept the fact that, as I read someone here on the forums saying, &quot;when i buy off SR I pretend I&#039;m gambling. Sometimes i get the prize, sometimes I don&#039;t&quot; (sorry I don&#039;t remember who said it to quote). But I guess people should be educated and informed about this, and not led to believe the mail system is so inefficient because it is not most of the time!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Sorry about the long post, but I&#039;ve been thinking about it and had to take it off my chest.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />Thanks for any illumination on the subject.<br /><br /><br />cmos

While i understand the vendor has to protect himself from scammer buyers, i wouldn&#039;t leave a 5/5 if a package didn&#039;t arrive (unless for not wanting a refund rate, idk) because I *myself* know as a fact I&#039;m not scamming and while many vendors are nice and talkative, we don&#039;t have anyway to really know what&#039;s happening behind the curtains.

If you buy 10 times and he delivers 9 out of 10, you could say something not related to the vendor happened, i guess...&nbsp; :P<br />

				For the PGP, I&#039;ve been using Portable PGP, available here: http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/<br /><br />It is easy to use, and the only criticism I&#039;ve seen the seems really valid is that it&#039;s not good with large files, which isn&#039;t a problem here.&nbsp; One of my Windows security tools doesn&#039;t like it, but the two anti-virus programs I alternate between both seem to think it&#039;s fine, so I&#039;ve stuck with it.&nbsp; It used to have GREAT simple and clear instructions on how to install and use it, but I could not find those at all this evening.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the person who wrote and posted them has been chastised mightily by the computer overlords for not talking around and around in technical circles... ;)

				I find GPA&nbsp; (from GPG4win) simple enough to use. I can add a key, encrypt a msg and get it passed to vendor in under a min. I think it works fine but also don&#039;t have a comparison. It did take a lot of reading and figuring out. PGP in general, not specifically GPA. Once you do it though your good to go and it really is easy. Just a few steps to encrypt. :)

				yah generally you use it for sensitive information. for simple messages and quick questions i wouldnt bother and some vendors dont have the time to decrypt regular messages. they get a lot of mail. if you think its going to get you in trouble if a vendor or sr becomes compromised they encrypt it otherwise i wouldnt worry about. i only encrpyt my address

Some vendors ask that you use PGP whenever possible, and others say they only have time to decrypt your address. One thing for sure, if you don&#039;t encrypt sensitive info (mainly your address) you&#039;re asking to get bent over! Reading the vendor pages is invaluable in more ways than just finding out their encryption preferences too. You can really start to get a good picture of the vendor just by reading all of their page, including ALL of their feedback.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />ChinoCat ;)

Some vendors ask that you use PGP whenever possible, and others say they only have time to decrypt your address. One thing for sure, if you don&#039;t encrypt sensitive info (mainly your address) you&#039;re asking to get bent over! Reading the vendor pages is invaluable in more ways than just finding out their encryption preferences too. You can really start to get a good picture of the vendor just by reading all of their page, including ALL of their feedback.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />ChinoCat ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />for sure. very good info

				Hi Proxanne!&nbsp; I&#039;m new also, and also decided that spamming to 50 wasn&#039;t my thing.&nbsp; I had trouble finding the right PGP software too, but eventually landed on gpg4usb, and it seems pretty reasonable.&nbsp; Nice to meet you.

				FYI, the key of gpg4usb@cpunk.de is the developer&#039;s key, it&#039;s there to verify the signature of their program. You can see that&#039;s it&#039;s not YOUR public key because it doesn&#039;t have any private key attached to it! Obviously, only the developers of gpg4usb will be able to read the messages you encrypted with it.

				i have recently switched to gpg4usb and i think its great. i think the layout and functionality is better then gpg4win. the main problem i had with gpg4win was i was getting like glitches and bugs or something when i tried to use the clipboard. the program would crash sometimes.

				Hi all. I am new here and I see this thread about GPG4win and the other USB package. I thought I would put in a plug for TAILS. I started with gpg4win and the TOR browser for windows and got that figured out (eventually), but then I was reading about TAILS and decided to try that instead. It is a self-contained secure OS unit you can install on a bootable USB drive. Includes a browser and easy-to-use gpg interface (plus email and private messaging and other basic tools I have not tried). More info here : https://tails.boum.org/ and on several threads here on the boards. <br /><br />I just received my first two SR orders from established vendors with good reviews, stealth etc. Nothing but professionalism so far!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />-saidanddone
