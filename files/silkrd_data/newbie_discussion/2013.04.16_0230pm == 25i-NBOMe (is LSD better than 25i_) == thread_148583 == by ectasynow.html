				What do you all think about 25i-NBOMe? Cleaner, better, cheaper, and safer than LSD? More profitable? Can it be sold as LSD? Just would like some 411 on this! ;D

				I think that it semi mimics the effects of LSD. Yes it is more profitable and sold as LSD. That is probably why it was created. If I were on the street and asked a lsd dealer for lsd and he said no, but, I have 25i. I would say no to buying it. But, if he just didn&#039;t tell me and said it was LSD I would probably just accept that and when taking it may have just that it was a different quality. I think it is used to trick people to make a higher profit.

				My friend tried both and said he likes LSD better. I&#039;d be careful with 25i because it has not been researched as much as LSD. Some people do sell 25i as LSD, but if you do that you&#039;re a dick.

				Completely different things, comparing apples to oranges etc. While on the topic though does anyone have any advice on how I could advertise 25i to some local buyers? I&#039;m obviously not going to sell it as LSD or anything but any way to make RESEARCH CHEMICAL sound less...threatening?

				Selling that cheap ass shit as lsd.. will get you nothing but bad life kharma.<br /><br />The substance ime, is garbage with a wide arrange of negative health effects.&nbsp; LSD and Nbome are nothing alike.&nbsp; I believe Nbome is a cheap nasty chemical which was created to map serotonin receptors in the brain because of it&#039;s high affinity to them. <br /><br />

				Thanks for the very stern advice! lol I just bought 500 doses that are being shipped as we speak. Now I&#039;m wondering if I made a mistake. I won&#039;t BS anyone since the difference seems to be significant. And I agree that to label it differently than what it is would be bad karma along with a good ass whipping, as was said in everyone&#039;s post. Thanks for the 411 since I am an old head that believes when it comes to tripping, only the REAL shit is required. (can anyone remember the &quot;Dead shows???&quot;) So...I will call it what it is and that&#039;s that. Should recoup my money either way. Thanks people of the Road! Love ya all&nbsp; :)

				In my opinion it is better then acid. But&nbsp; &nbsp;the rest of my friends tend to say they prefer the feeling of acid. But to each there own and I find with both ever trip is way different(although more so with lsd)

				I&#039;ve heard nothing but negative feedback on the comparative quality of the NBOMe group to LSD in terms of cleanness and chemical calibre. <br /><br />Definitely pick LSD over NBOMe, but a select few might have a propensity to respond better to one over the other.. It&#039;s subjective.<br /><br />Probably shouldn&#039;t have thrown the hammer and ordered 50 for the first try, but still.. You may enjoy.<br /><br />Acid definitely prevails.<br /><br />If you try to sell NBOMe as LSD, you will just make enemies. Don&#039;t be a penis.

				safer? absolutely fucking not<br /><br />25i has only been around for a few years and there are already several documented deaths. LSD is one of the most biologically non-toxic drugs there are, and it&#039;s active in such tiny doses that it&#039;s practically impossible to OD.<br /><br />that alone makes you not just a penis for trying to pass off 25i as lsd, it makes you a fucking criminal. if some poor shmuck thinks you gave him acid and figures that since acid is so safe, and he is an experienced user, he ends up taking a bunch of tabs at once, you may just end up killing him. which is bad for his friends/family, bad for your reputation as a dealer, and bad for the community of responsible psychonauts.<br /><br />as for the actual effects of 25i, i can&#039;t claim to know anything about them. all i know is that it is a derivative/analogue of 2c-i, and that makes me hesitant to try it because my friends and i have only had unpleasant experiences with 2c-i (2c-b, on the other hand...). acid is something that i have always found pleasant, even in situations where it was probably a bad idea to have taken it i always came out unscathed. but then i know a number of people who it turns into horrible unbalanced psychotic self-destructive zombies. the general rule of thumb is: any psychedelic substance can potentially have any number of unknown and unexpected effects that vary wildly from individual to individual, therefore always be responsible when experimenting on yourself, know your limits and how you react to things, and never ever ever ever ever mislead others or expect other to react in the same way as you.
