				Can you name the seller to help out other folks who might order from them? Besides maybe calling them out will help move things along.<br /><br />FE&#039;ing for a large order is tough. With large orders it is best if you and the vendor have some history and maybe a bit of trust.

				not much like already said call him out on the forums, keep trying to get in touch , i hope he was a reputable vendor and one that you used time and time before , before you decided to FE on large order....i never FE unless i get the tracking, and even than i generally dont on bigger orders, i hope its just a mistake and you and vendor can work it out , but from now on DONT FE especially if you are an established buyer there should be no reason too

				Why in the hell do people make threads like this without stating the name of the vendor?<br /><br />Are you trying to protect the dude who is scamming you? I serously don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Let me guess, it was Thurgood Jenkins? If so, you just lost all your money.<br /><br />If not, maybe you are in luck. Who was it?

				I&#039;m afraid there isn&#039;t much you can do. You can keep trying to contact them, but I&#039;m not sure what good that will do you if he&#039;s ignoring you.<br /><br />This is why you need to be VERY careful of FE, especially for such large orders.

				Why would you FE? Ever? NEVER FE! Even if the vendor is your BIOLOGICAL PARENT, DO NOT FE. <br /><br />I&#039;m bewildered how and why people do this.

				There are a few well known and high ranked vendors that will require you to FE, say if you have 5 orders or less or something similar. I personally have never and will never do it. It is just to much risk.<br /><br />I understand that vendors take some risk if noob&#039;s do not FE. But there are ones that will do it so use them.<br /><br />As to why someone would FE on there 1st large order is beyond me?

				Right, but there are a LOT of vendors (most) that do NOT require even newbies to FE. All you have to do is communicate with them. What&#039;s the worst they&#039;ll say? No? There are so many options on SR that it&#039;s *almost* impossible to not find your drug-of-choice without having to finalize early!<br />And that way you build your stats, etc etc.. and by that time have enough cred to be above the threshold that the bigger/high rank vendors hold for newbies, and voila.. no FE needed.<br /><br /><br />Small order or big order makes no difference.. FEing is asking for trouble.

				I agree with colorblack, there are a lot of vendors who don&#039;t require FE for new buyers. Some of them clearly say so in their profile, others may only inform you after you place an order, but in that case you should cancel instead of FEing, because this is exactly what can happen.<br /><br />There are enough vendors who don&#039;t require it that you don&#039;t ever have to FE.
