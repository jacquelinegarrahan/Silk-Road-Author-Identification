				I ordered a 25C tab from Silo a long while back. Apparently he got bad reviews recently and deleted his seller account. I also heard he created a new account under the name Keyz3r Soze but anyway is it safe to take the tab? Has anyone else tried his 25C blotters from about 2-3 months ago? Also, I have a few 25I blotters from Righteous sitting around. I have taken 25I a couple times back in the day, and it was pretty &quot;fun&quot; I guess. I was about to take one last night, but I talked to an old friend last night and he said he thinks 25I messed him up. He only took it 8 times, but the last time he said he began pacing through his room, then was vomiting a ton and was about to pass out. So, he says he called 911. He says ever since then he has been having chest pains and horrible anxiety whenever he does any drug. He says they got him on Prozac now, and to me SSRi&#039;s are so horrible. I tired them once for a month and I felt like a zombie. In my opinion Prozac is worse than any NBOMe... To me it just sounds like a horribly bad trip, but has anyone else experienced anxiety or health dangers from the NBOMe&#039;s? Also, can someone experienced distinguish some differences between 25I and 25C?

				I&#039;ve taken 25i at least 5 times at 1000ug doses.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not experienced the negative effects that your friend did, but, maybe he took higher dosages during his trip.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you that I&#039;m not the same as I was before but I&#039;ve also done other drugs.&nbsp; Mostly memory problem but I could be just getting old.

				He said the most he ever took was 800ug of the 25I.&nbsp; He also said he had taken 25B over 20 times before with nothing bad.&nbsp; I took&nbsp; 600/800ug twice with no long lasting adverse effects.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have that great of a trip, but nothing too bad.&nbsp; In my opinion I just think he has really bad anxiety, and the NBOMe made that worse.&nbsp; I have noticed slight chest pains after taking 25I.&nbsp; I thought they could just be from my general anxiety.&nbsp; Like whenever I think of something stressful I get chest pains.&nbsp; I think it probably worsened his already bad anxiety.&nbsp; Anxiety is a struggle to control without drugs, but I don&#039;t believe in SSRis.

				ah.&nbsp; then yeah, probably.<br /><br />Until a few days ago, I had no idea how anxiety can be so bad (aka panic attacks).&nbsp; I thought it was one of those &quot;made up&quot; diseases like ADHD or depression (jk btw).&nbsp; I had a bad trip in which I couldn&#039;t get my break off it no matter what I tried.&nbsp; I always thought of myself as a &quot;never quit, never give up&quot; kind of guy but that night I thought about ending it.

				Yeah, speaking from experience, once you start having panic attacks you&#039;ll be susceptible to them for the rest of your life.<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned to control them though. To stop them before they happen but I&#039;d still like to not have them at all.<br /><br />Honestly the most frightening experience of my life.. every time. Bad trip x 1000000 and every moment it gets infinitely worse. Can only lie down and scream. Be careful with your brain.

				Yeah I think its just anxiety from a bad trip.&nbsp; This makes me feel a lot better, and I will probably try some of Righteous&#039;s 25i this weekend.&nbsp; Has anyone ordered 25C from Silo like 2-3 months ago, and tried it?&nbsp; I heard 25C is pretty awesome, and I&#039;d like to try it.&nbsp; I am just scared to take it because Silo got bad reviews, and I read that he is an Avengers bad vendor.

				Well, if it makes you feel any better, 60 people have ordered my free samples in the last 48 hours. Moreover, I source my 25-c Nbome from a reliable chinese laboratory that I have been using for over three years. I have given/sold it to more than fifteen hundred people, and about 98% of them have loved it. Nearly everyone who has purchased it from me in real life over the last year and a half has become a repeat customer.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I don&#039;t really care if you get my free samples or not, but you&#039;re missing out man. my shit is the bomb. Hell, my listing will be up for another three weeks, wait till I get some feedback. I am 100% confident I will get rave reviews on here just like I do in real life.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Opanthalgic

				Thanks for the offer, but I am apprehensive about NBOMe&#039;s in general right now...&nbsp; Plus, I don&#039;t want to have to pay the international shipping, or are you in the U.S.?

				Yeah, a bit sketched out about the n-bombs myself, even though I *think* I&#039;ve taken them before.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have anything against them really, I just dig acid. <br />I mean I may try the free samples, but acid is great.

				I had the best visuals of any psychedelic off my first time trying 25i at 800ug. (not counting DMT, that is a different category).&nbsp; It was very intense, and the body load is pretty speedy.&nbsp; I was watching Afro Samurai and people were like different colors and morphing into lizards and shit... and I might try your 25C.

				I&#039;ve never ordered anything from the road before. I want to get some 25b as it&#039;s my favorite nbome I&#039;ve tried. I was wondering which vendor you all think is the most &#039;noob&#039; friendly? I&#039;m leaning towards ENBOOM, but was also thinking about GunsAreBad or j1m1th1ng but I&#039;ve seen some questionable feedback on the latter two.

				Honestly, I am not very experienced with NBOMe vendors.&nbsp; I have also read that 25B is the most uncomfortable with the most body load, but maybe I read wrong.&nbsp; Which is weird because my friend used to take 25B and said it was his favorite.&nbsp; I think he just mixed up the chemical names and meant 25C because when I bought it from him like 7 months ago he said 25C I think.&nbsp; I have read 25C is very nice.&nbsp; Plus, I honestly have no idea where he got those tabs that gave him a bad trip from (anything could&#039;ve been on them).&nbsp; He says the guy he got them from is legit, and that guy bought them off silk road.&nbsp; The weird thing is I have never seen anybody sell 400ug tabs on SR...&nbsp; I think the guy he got them from either bought them from somewhere else, or they were actually around 1000ug which is why they were so strong.&nbsp; From what I have read online my 800ug trips have been as strong as 1.5-2ug for others...&nbsp; Another thing that makes me question the dealer he got them from is that he said when I bought them that his dealer said they were &quot;double dipped so they&#039;re super strong&quot; which I have read is pretty pointless when laying blotters... It&#039;s just another bs dealer selling scheme.&nbsp; Has anyone ever seen any Crop Circle printed NBOMe tabs like a 6-10 months ago?
