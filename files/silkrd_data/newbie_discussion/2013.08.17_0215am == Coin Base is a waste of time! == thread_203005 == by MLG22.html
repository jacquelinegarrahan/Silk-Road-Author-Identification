				Verified not one, but two bank accounts, along with phone number, and still have no coins. After waiting the bullshit 4 days to get my coins I get the &quot;Declined due to High Risk.&quot; Literally 20 minutes before the coins were supposed to arrive in my account, I get the email. I&#039;ve also read that their program decides instantly whether or not to turn you down, but they still hold you money for four days. If this is true, I wonder what exactly they do with the money for those few days...The value of coins went up a considerable amount while this was processing, and I&#039;m kind of thinking that they back out of the deal if the value goes up beyond a certain point. The payment had even cleared my bank account 2 days ago, this is frustrating, as I was really looking forward to trying Cher&#039;s microdots. I have emailed them to review my case, but I&#039;m really thinking of just using Localbitcoins instead, even if they decide to clear my account. I wouldn&#039;t waste my time if you&#039;re new to bitcoins, as they will literally waste weeks of your time all while holding your money.

				That really blows, i&#039;d be pissed too. i&#039;ve used them a few times and got the coinage. your right though, they basically invest your money while &#039;holding&#039; it. would be interested to know what their support says
