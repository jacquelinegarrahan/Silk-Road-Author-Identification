				I know, I just made a MDMA thread in this section, but I wanted to discuss mister m100 in particular. There&#039;s hardly ANY reviews, but the ones that are there seem good. anyone have personal experience? His prices are on point, product picture seems to be on point also.<br /><br />Now I just need some verification and some comforting stories about packages coming safely and stealthily to the US :)

If anything, it&#039;s safe. In all honesty i&#039;ve been slow on getting funds and getting a wallet and bitcoins setup, and truthfully i&#039;m glad. I have been on here watching, and I&#039;ve already seen a couple vendors fall through on people (vendors that I most likely would have bought from had I already had bitcoins and everything setup.. Foxbelle for example). Supertrips is another, although he hasn&#039;t really &quot;fallen through,&quot; but regardless I now know that I&#039;m not comfortable ordering with him after watching people discuss him recently.<br /><br />&nbsp;Everytime I get on Tor and tell myself i&#039;m going to &quot;get stuff accomplished,&quot; such as PGP and figuring out depositing bitcoins, I end up window-shopping like a kid in a toy store for three hours. lol. Plus on top of this I&#039;m a college student who also has a job. <br /><br />And whose site are you talking about? Do you mean AfterHours, from my other topic?? I found it weird I couldn&#039;t find him after I had just been on his page an hour or two ago.<br />

				LuckyLucianno is who I plan on ordering from in the future (Canada basically IS domestic for people in the US) because his minimum order is 28 g.<br /><br />. XTC Express or mister m100 or AfterHours have got my attention (all from Germany, I&#039;m fairly sure) for my first order
