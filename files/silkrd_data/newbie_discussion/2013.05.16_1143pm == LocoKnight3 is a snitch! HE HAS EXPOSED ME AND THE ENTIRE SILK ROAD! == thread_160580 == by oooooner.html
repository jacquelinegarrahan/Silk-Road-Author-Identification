				This should not be possible if you are being safe.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t be using your real return address, and people don&#039;t just &quot;guess&quot; at a phone number successfully unless they have clues pointing them to it.&nbsp; It is slightly concerning because somehow you provided info enough either here or privately to the buyer that allowed his mother to track you down.&nbsp; Again, this really shouldn&#039;t be happening if you&#039;re taking your security seriously.

I doubt you are going to have too many problems from LE from sending one pill but do you want to chance it. If it were me I would sanitize the place and find a different location to store your shit. I don&#039;t think anyone here is telling people not to do business with you. But it was you that aired the dirty laundry.

				This is bizarre, I don&#039;t understand how this has been traced back to you at all if it was a fake address, unless you&#039;ve supplied them with your name and they&#039;ve some how looked you up. Also, this above is another mistake. You&#039;re a vendor and you have all this information on your hard drive readily available?

It seems you have a fundamental misunderstanding about how SR works, how TOR works and even how Bitcoins work. You should really clue yourself up on these things before making scary posts, especially to newbies who may not know any better.<br /><br />Finally, to anyone that is new to Silk Road, please take the time to learn as much as you can about security and how SR, TOR&nbsp; and Bitcoins work. Then you will not make fundamental mistakes that could end up with you or someone else coming to the attention of LE and facing either a large fine and/or a custodial sentence.
