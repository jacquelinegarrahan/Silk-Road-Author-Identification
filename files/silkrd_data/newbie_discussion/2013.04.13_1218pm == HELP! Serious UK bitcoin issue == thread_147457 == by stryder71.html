				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m gutted. I normally buy my bitcoins from blockchain.info because it&#039;s been the simplest method for me so far, I&#039;d rather use an exchange for smaller bitcoin purchases because it&#039;s fast and easy. Well I tried to log on last night to blockchain and it wouldn&#039;t even let me get to the wallet area, just kept saying error. Today it finally lets me on and guess what, no method for purchasing bitcoins in the UK is available anymore on blockchain. So I thought that maybe I can join Mt Gox or intersango with my tormail but tormail is totally fucked at the moment, won&#039;t even get past the login page, just keep getting an error message. There&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m opening an account using a none secure email service so WTF am I supposed to do?<br />CAN WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR BITCOIN PURCHASES IN THE UK PLEASE!!!!!!!!!????????????? IT SERIOUSLY TAKES THE PISS.<br /><br />Anyway,<br />does anybody know about a method which works well in the UK? Or an equally secure email service? I don&#039;t want to use local bitcoins or anything like that because I want to buy a smaller amount, there&#039;s a small purchase I want to make on the road and don&#039;t want to put more than I need into my SR account because I don&#039;t know whether it will drop in value so I just want enough in the account for this very small purchase of about ten pounds, but local bitcoins etc usually only sell 1 bitcoin minimum.<br />Please, there must be another solution to this, any ideas?

It&#039;s the cheapest way.<br />Expect a 2-3 working day turnaround though.<br /><br />Intersango won&#039;t work for your small amounts and using TOR or VPN can get you suspended from MtGox.<br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />
