				I remember awhile ago there was someone who claimed to be a cave dwelling shaman on here and for a fee he would offer to put a hex on you or someone you wanted hexed and I just remembered cracking up at a line he put at the bottom which went something like &quot;I&#039;ll put a hex on you..... but you gotta believe it.&quot;&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t stop laughing.<br /><br />There are a couple items I bookmarked and then I waited around and didn&#039;t get them and now they are gone.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Namely PCP, Bromo-Dragonfly, and liquid IV ready morphine.&nbsp; Although that last one I&#039;m quite sure isn&#039;t as rare as the other two and I&#039;m sure it will pop back up eventually.&nbsp; But now that I have discovered I love dissociatives there is no PCP!&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; And that was the only person I&#039;ve ever heard of or seen offering Bromo-Dragonfly since the deaths.<br /><br />Also I order some regular legal tea on here and was amused that out of all the highly illegal things I&#039;ve ordered on here the legal one is one of the few to never arrive. Lol.

				Hey, if you like dissociatives try the strongest Salvia you can find. Take and hold a massive hit from a bong with a torch lighter and enjoy.

				I&#039;ve got some like year old extract lying around.&nbsp; I was thinking about doing the so called &quot;quid&quot; method one of these days.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I just did my first IM MXE the other evening.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; That&#039;s what got me back into the dis game.&nbsp; But IDK,&nbsp; Salvia is one fucking weird drug.&nbsp; It&#039;s not nearly as pleasurable as a regular dissasociative is for me.&nbsp; More like a dissasociative that feels like a deleriant.&nbsp; And anyways I&#039;d have to order fresh stuff off of here or travel to a different state which is entirely to much effort for something that I don&#039;t LOVE ya know?
