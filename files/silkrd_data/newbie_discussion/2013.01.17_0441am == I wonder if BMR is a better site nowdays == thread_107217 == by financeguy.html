But SR is the only one that has any credibility IMHO. Not saying you won&#039;t find a leg vendor at other sites. But you risk getting ripped off. <br /><br />Links in hidden sites will take you to places you don&#039;t want to go.<br /><br />While it is very very hard and expensive near and impossible to track use of hidden services they are not infallible. You still have to be careful of where you go and what you do.

				I have some experience from BMR and everything worked as expected.<br />But it looks that BMR lacks popularity and is infected with numerous scammers, maybe because it is cheaper to become vendor in BMR.<br />But the site works if u always stay in escrow and pay attention what vendor u use.

				Im gonna stick with silkroad. Like how the hell does someone think they are gonna ship me a ak47 that doesnt need reassembling? bmr looks sketchy as hell. At least silkroad looks like a site that wasnt put together by someone writing basic script. ive never ordered from there so i cant backup my claim but i suggest people stay away from there.<br />

				It&#039;s not all that bad. It&#039;s simply a necessary alternative.<br />Try to think of it as that sketchy, sorta scummy dealer you first started buying really seedy weed from (probably named Tony). Sometimes your good dealer is out of town and you have to reluctantly settle for Tony.<br />Tony probably isn&#039;t too bad a guy. Sure, he&#039;ll want you to hang with him and play GTA on his ps2, but overall its better to know a Tony than not know a Tony.<br /><br />So hey. Here&#039;s to BMR and Tony. Cheers.

				I went to BMR once, and I haven&#039;t found a reason to take the leap of faith. It looks semi-legit, but I haven&#039;t found the userbase of SR that gained my trust. Some day, I may hop over to BMR though. For now SR is great and all, but it&#039;s expensive as shit with a lot of things, but fortunately I have found local sources for everything and don&#039;t have to rely on it as much. <br /><br />Except JWH. Man I need SR for spice.

				I kind of like the sketchiness of BMR, if SR goes down for a long period of time again I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to go over there. It could definitely use some reformatting though.

				I learned about it at the same time as SR.&nbsp; I love the Road of course but I think there always has to be more than one market.&nbsp; But for sure, BMR was just lame.&nbsp; I know there are probably some good vendors there but for now my BTC is with SR. <br /><br />&nbsp;Likewise, I long for a market for other than drugs; I appreciate and understand the wise separation of marketplaces for drugs and guns ie the Armory.&nbsp; &nbsp;I support the Second Amendment and see it getting all stripped down...Fucked up world its all upside down.&nbsp; Uh oh politics talk I&#039;m outta here..

				It&#039;s good there&#039;s more than just SR out there. Good for competition, good just in case this place disappears some day. But SR has everything I would ever need and more. Only thing that BMR has that we don&#039;t is guns, which I don&#039;t need&nbsp; :)

				I just noticed a site called PotCo on the hidden wiki, looks like it hasn&#039;t been updated in forever though.&nbsp; Anyone have any experience with them?&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with the others that competition is healthy.&nbsp; The more amount of markets there are that are trying to get our business, the better.&nbsp; That means better deals for the consumer.
