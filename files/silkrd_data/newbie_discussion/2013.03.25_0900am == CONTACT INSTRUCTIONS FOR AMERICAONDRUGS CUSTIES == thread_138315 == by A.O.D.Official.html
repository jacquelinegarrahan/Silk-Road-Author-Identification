				It varies quite a bit as we sell a good amount in real life as well, but in the past two weeks we&#039;ve had Blue Dream, Cherry Kush, Strawberry Cough, AK-47, Pineapple Thai, Bubbleberry Crack, Jack Herer, and a few others. If you&#039;ve got a favorite we could certainly look into that for you. :)

				I first encountered AmericaOnDrugs today while browsing the road as I do on a daily basis and was pleasantly surprised to see someone new who had great taste in products and reasonable prices!&nbsp; After messaging AoD asking about more details for the bud (smell/looks/nug size/growing substrate aka hydro/indoor/greenhouse) as well as details about the shrooms I received a prompt response stating he was super busy with orders but would respond later.&nbsp; I Completely understand this and thank him so much for taking the time to simply make me aware that he has read my message and plans to respond.&nbsp; He re-confirmed that he remembered my message AGAIN during the afternoon as he was still swamped with orders.&nbsp; A few hours later and I had a great comprehensive response that I could tell was honest and answered all of my questions.&nbsp; <br /><br />By taking the simple steps of letting me know he read my messages Aod showed how much they value their clients and want to make the buying experience as smooth and comfortable as possible.&nbsp; After reading AoD&#039;s response and having talked throughout the day and thoroughly browsed their vendor page I decided to message AoD this time to request a custom order of a combination of Penis Envy Mushrooms and Cannabis.&nbsp; Again I got a very quick response that they were making exactly the listing I asked for; it was up and ready literally 3 minutes after this!!!! <br /><br />So far AmericaOnDrugs has been a phenomenal vendor and I am Super excited to try my 1.5 ounces of penis envies and he surprised me with the strain of the half ounce of cannabis: God Bud!!! :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m an Extremely happy client and more than satisfied with AoD&#039;s customer service and flexibility and haven&#039;t even been able to actually place the custom order that AoD made for me yet until my coins are loaded tomorrow!&nbsp; Keep your eyes peeled for the rest of the review when the order is purchased and when it gets here and is devoured! HAHA&nbsp; In the following reviews I&#039;ll try my best to honestly describe the following aspects of my order:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Communication / Customer Service:&nbsp; Already off to a perfect start<br />&nbsp;- Shipping time<br />&nbsp;- Quality of packaging stealth (no details)<br />&nbsp;- Detailed review of the looks, smell and taste of the God Bud and Penis Envy Cubes<br />&nbsp;- Potency and effects / Trip report!!<br /><br /><br />AmericaOnDrugs deserves a perfect A+ at this point and have proven themselves to ,meet and exceed the standards of many veteran vendors here on the road with only 1 month of experience!&nbsp; I say 100% give them a try, I have no doubt that my expectations will be exceeded with this first order !!!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thank You AmericaOnDrugs,<br /><br />&nbsp;- N

When we inevitably open our doors to international (we are USA domestic for now) orders though, we may start using them as an additional precaution/safeguard against the prying eyes of customs.<br /><br />Update: We now use MBBs for all orders, foreign and domestic. :)

				Thanks for the recognition AoD I try my best when it comes to giving good vendors the credit and recognition they deserve.. that being said my order got here already (Saturday morning) after ordering Thursday night across country so here&#039;s my review!!<br /><br />Order: PE Cubensis + God&#039;s Gift Cannabis<br /><br />Communication:&nbsp; all I can say is perfect, nothing can be said negatively regarding AoD&#039;s customer service and response time for messages.&nbsp; He not only responds rapidly with actual answers to what I ask without beating around the bush AND is willing to talk back and forth with me about any other questions I want to ask about future possibilities, products, custom stuff, what the weather is like... etc ya get the point!&nbsp; Some (I&#039;d venture to say most) vendors don&#039;t put this effort into customer service commonly using the excuse of being too busy which I totally get; but AoD sold out of ALL his bud and shrooms and EVERYTHING in like less than two days so I know he was super busy and he never said a thing about it.&nbsp; As he says, he never sleeps and I believe it considering all the time spent catering to the client&#039;s every need!<br /><br />Shipping: Fucking Ridiculously awesome and surprising.. ordered Thursday night, arrived Saturday morning regular priority mail.&nbsp; The USPS says on their website for tracking that my order was scheduled to arrive until Monday and after I opened the package it (usps website) still said it was at the sorting facility hahaha AoD works wonders.. he must have an inside man in the post!&nbsp; The stealth was excellent with all necessary measures taken and both the bud and cubes were packaged in a way that kept them pristine and not all smushed and compact (I hate when vendors do not take measures to prevent this) its not rocket science for those who squish their shit so any vendor who does this should order from AoD and take note Ha!<br /><br />Appearance:&nbsp; <br /><br />PE Cubes - My first time having the opportunity to get some penis envy shrooms and I picked the right place.&nbsp; Great looking quality; each fruit is intact and not all banged up and there was a cap for every stem!&nbsp; Also there was no shake which is how it should be for an HQ item.&nbsp; I once dosed 5+ grams of shake from a different vendor and had zero effect which meant it was probably just frickin&#039; substrate powder I ate and was used to add weight to the order.. NOTE this was NOT AoD just saying this to show the significance of him giving me all whole shrooms!<br /><br />God&#039;s Gift - I&#039;ve ordered alot of great bud on the road so it&#039;s hard to blow me away but the smell alone did it for me... wait were not in that section yet.&nbsp; The buds looked like top shelf should look.&nbsp; Nice medium to large size I&#039;d say .75 as the smallest to probably around 5g biggest which for the size of my order was amazing!&nbsp; They nugs were covered in trichomes and nice and dense with many light orange hairs emerging from within the beautiful dark green buds!&nbsp; The cure was perfect on the GG just enough resistance when broken apart by hand and sure to leave your fingers sticking together!<br /><br />Smell/Taste<br /><br />PE Cubes - smell like mushrooms, taste like mushrooms, they must be mushrooms! Hahah<br /><br />God&#039;s Gift:&nbsp; Godly is a good word to describe the smell and taste since the mirror each other perfectly.&nbsp; This bud seriously REEKS of citrous like I just peeled a hundred oranges and limes and then a a super dank smell hits your nose and just stays there for a long time which is pleasant!<br /><br />Potency:<br /><br />I will update on the cubes since I haven&#039;t tried them yet but the cannabis gave me a really strong and instantaneous high which usually doesn&#039;t happen to me or hit me as hard since I consume large amounts of the plant.&nbsp; This GG though was a different story and gave me a great head/mind high while leaving me able to function at my boss&#039;s dinner party which I attended right after sampling..&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />AAA+&nbsp; AmericaOnDrugs you did exactly what I predicted on Friday and Exceeded my expectations and for that I thank you!<br /><br />&nbsp;- N

				<br />Vendor: America On Drugs<br /><br /><br />Strain: Penuis Envy (mushrooms)<br /><br />Package/Shipping:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome packaging, and shipping time :) Had perfect seals, and labeled digitally :) Only draw back would be the hand-placed <br />stamps for the postage. You can create a nice work flow for USPS by going digital, and it probably lessens number of times it has to be in route while in transit being shipped out.<br /><br />Color/Appearance:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome thick specimens and really big :) The shrooms i got <br />where nice and thick, and very well colored, with its nice wrinkly off white stem, and blue trailing along the veins inward along the lining of the stem. The caps had a nice shape and very much looked<br />like what penises do, hence the name for it ! lol. Awesome coloring to the caps aswell, with about a 50/50 creamish brown/orangey gold color.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Image Link: http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/711.jpg<br /><br />Smell/Aroma:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nice musky pscylocibe scent, thats drifts and can capture your nose, with a funky lil&#039; stench that you can&#039;t deny :) Kinda like a fresh compost heap type of smelly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Touch/Feel:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shrooms where a nice bone dry feel and had no moisture in them, and where not like just picked fresh, no these where nice and <br />ready with a good feel of crunchiness and form.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Experience/Effect:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had ate the shrooms after around lunch time, and had planned to watch movies like &quot;Dead Circles&quot;, and another one called &quot;Warm Bodies&quot;, as i laid there waiting for my love to arrive, i had felt a slight lift of mood, as i got out the shower. The initial come up was not that intense compared to like golden teachers but i figured this was going to be less visual and more psychedelic then my previous experiences with mushrooms,but i was to be surprised. i had taken a bath and and finished within about 40 minutes into getting dressed i almost started forgetting my train of thought, as i appeared to stare at the floor now, thinking the floor that was like marble, had like juice stains on it, because i what i was seeing was the actual design of the marble floor and not like some old crummy strain of juice, what i had thought to be something was clearly not the case here. This is when i knew the shrooms were grooving in me, but like a silent creeper. I love this lil&#039; moment where all time seems to stand still, and you can just feel like in a quiet head space of stillness and peace. By the time my significant other had arrived, i was with question on why and how, and what was i on ? I could feel, i was a lil&#039; off, but the mushrooms where very controllable, and easy to maneuver in my normal functions, but it still had its own type of like leadway into perception and wonder, as i just kept it to myself among the questioning. :) By that time, i could see small morphs of colors and schemes from my perception, as i could see like colors kinda blend in endlessly and seemed to have like a nice warmer feel and a little more vibrant than when seeing things out of a clean sober eye. By this time, i was having a nice breakthrough and was easily able to communicate, and reflect off life so well, i had no problems expressing myself. I then got so much off my chest, and was able to get things done, all over the house, and still brought a new meaning to my life all awhile having a good time and enjoying myself. The initial onset, was sublime and didn&#039;t even leave a strong tummy feeling, this was really gentle as the come almost felt effortless, and non apparent, but soon i was to realize this strain is another league of its own when bringing the user its effects of goodness.Once my wave settled in, i was gone for a good strong hour and half, pretty much engulfed in my solitude and dependent on my imaginative adventure thinking. It was really introspective as i was able to start separating the difference of myself and how i project myself to others :) It took about a good or aswell to start subsiding and letting my vibe wear-off<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Overall: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super groovy vendor and awesome experience overall ! I can&#039; reiterate, the special handling on the package as it was on par with delivery and creative shipping. I can&#039;t wait to see some shrooms this vendor is offering, to get a better detail and experience once again. And much thanks to A.O.D. again !!!! :)<br />:)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />SR profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6a1a8a7aea<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				AOD - You shouldn&#039;t post private chats between you and a buyer out in public, even if you&#039;re trying to prove a point. Settle that in private chat and after an agreement has been made openly state it and also have the buyer state it..Exposing conversations that was suppose to be meant in private isn&#039;t very professional. It would be hard to trust a vendor after he has posted a private chat between him and a buyer when it&#039;s suppose to be PRIVATE.

That&#039;s why the review thread is here, so you can make informed decisions. That being said, I use iOS to check messages while on the go, and minimize customer wait times. No PGP/GPG data is stored on my (jailbroken with numerous added security features I might add) wireless device. I do actually know what I&#039;m doing here. Also, I stand by my decision to post the aforementioned chat log as I carefully reviewed it for personal information before doing so, and I believe my customers deserve to as fully informed as I can safely allow. In this situation a screenshot was the most practical and honest method of defending our good name against a generally crabby human being.

				I had typed up most of a review a few days ago whilst using the product I received from AoD, but got distracted (most likely by a shiny object) and the computer decided to reboot and dump everything I had written, so here goes my second attempt:<br /><br />Product: crystal methamphetamine (.5 g)<br /><br />Communication: Excellent!&nbsp; The vendor replied to my first message promptly and has been very good about sending replies back and forth since.&nbsp; They were willing to tailor a custom order since I was a few a dollar or two shy of having the amount needed for the .5 and really didn&#039;t want to have to go through another bitcoin transaction just for that amount.&nbsp; AoD is exceptionally polite and kind, which is something not everyone values but I do, personally.&nbsp; If I wanted to go get yelled at by people in the ghetto while trying to find drugs and be talked to like I am a piece of shit, I would not be paying a premium to use an internet service that requires a certain level of basic knowledge to even access, I&#039;d be down in the ghetto overpaying for bathtub sudafed rocks with chunks of blue rock candy mixed in that the dealer claims is some real shit from Heisenberg himself.&nbsp; Just kidding, that would never happen because there&#039;s no meth on the East Coast unless you find just the right gay club or trailer park, or perhaps some odd combination of the two that makes you leave feeling dirty and confused.<br /><br /><br />Stealth: Awesome.&nbsp; Sealed multiple times and may even give me something to entertain myself in the future if I feel so inclined; I definitely had a genuine laugh while opening it.&nbsp; I am fairly confident it would have been sufficient for international stealth, but luckily we didn&#039;t have that to worry about, which brings me to....<br /><br />Shipping: Free shipping seems to be included with all of AoD&#039;s products, at least for domestic.&nbsp; AoD and I had talked prior to my placing the order and they stated that despite our being on opposite ends of the US, they had every confidence that my order would arrive within 2-3 days due to priority shipping.&nbsp; In the past, I have heard that before and had packages inevitably still take the usual 7-8 days, which is a long time to be waiting anxiously for some fun things.&nbsp; Well, AoD said it and meant it.&nbsp; My package shipped on Tuesday and arrived on Thursday.&nbsp; Mind=blown.&nbsp; Free priority shipping that is actually priority?&nbsp; Fuck yeah!<br /><br />Product (Value): I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m unusual in this aspect, but the product seemed to last me FOREVER.&nbsp; I stayed awake for the better part of the four days that I was constantly pretty buzzed from it (didn&#039;t try dosing between 9 PM and 6 AM generally so I could at least give my body a chance to sleep if it wanted to) and this half gram lasted.&nbsp; I also shared some of it with my significant other periodically, but they are not into going hard with it like I am and staying up for days.&nbsp; If I hadn&#039;t, it absolutely would have lasted me another half day.&nbsp; What that translates to when running a good ol&#039; cost/benefit analysis means that I spent $45 to have a 4.5 day-long enhancement.&nbsp; I probably have a fairly high default amphetamine tolerance because I like go get crystal about once a week or every other week&nbsp; lately and I had a pretty hefty adderall habit for a few months that just ended in April (probably around 200 mg every day).&nbsp; So, even with those factors opposing me, I made a $45 investment last four whole days, would have been a little longer had I been stingy with my better half, but I would much rather share than do things alone.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about anyone else, but that investment is about the most I have EVER gotten value-wise from any drug purchase by a wide, wide margin.&nbsp; I doubt that I could make a $45 investment in weed even last me 4.5 days if I wanted to stay blazed the whole time.<br /><br />Product (Details): I&#039;d also like to note that while I didn&#039;t get the change to weight the product since I dumped it right into a heavy container, it did look like a very healthy half G.&nbsp; The shards were mostly rather small but that was likely from the way it was sealed for shipping; didn&#039;t have anything powdery mixed in, just varying size of shards, somewhat like looking at a snowflake really close up.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t notice any change in effect whether I used the larger shards or the smaller shards at any time, so there isn&#039;t bullshit cut to worry about with the product unless it was included in the process prior to crystalization.&nbsp; I would guess that I got 20 doses out of the .5 G at the VERY minimum, probably closer to 25 or 30, and tried it various ways.&nbsp; The effects from oral consumption (my personal favourite) were very good, as they were for snorting too.&nbsp; I decided to experiment and try it via IV, despite never having IV&#039;ed meth before.&nbsp; When doing my homework, I came across some people on forums saying they generally shoot .25 G at a time, which would be half of what I had gotten.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn&#039;t do that, I went with a smaller dose than I normally use for snorting to start, and worked my way up to a larger one than I usually use for snorting or oral, and found that the effects were pretty similar despite the dose.&nbsp; I had heard before that IV methamphetamine is very intense and one of the greatest rushes, but I think I am spoiled by heroin and was expecting something like that.&nbsp; I did feel an almost immediate surge of alertness when IVing and it somehow seems to be a little more clear-headed, but that might have just been my brain chemistry making me feel foggy towards the end of the run.&nbsp; I have never tried smoking it and don&#039;t plan to since I have a deathly fear of dental problems and don&#039;t want to put myself in that situation.<br /><br />So, there you have it.&nbsp; AmericaOnDrugs is a delightful vendor with a product I definitely enjoyed and I will be ordering from them again.&nbsp; In all honesty, I would be happy if AoD were the only vendor I ever had to work with on here again, but unfortunately I doubt that they can get me quaaludes or whatever other various endangered/extinct drug species I&#039;m going to have to try just in the name of science.&nbsp; Cheers to that.

				WOW what can I say...<br /><br />Firstly, my package arrived to the UK in 5 days - so 5/5 for that. Secondly the meth itself is AMAZING quality. I used three different routes of administration, and was impressed on all accounts. The meth in the UK (which is extremely rare anyway) is miles apart from the quality of AOD&#039;s product.<br /><br />I recommend all UK or for that matter all international buyers to go for this product off AOD - I&#039;ll certainly be returning and recommending AOD to anyone that happens to ask where the good Meth&#039;s at.<br /><br />Stealth was excellent too, which of course is a bonus - especially when going international.<br /><br />All I can say is a huge thank-you to AOD and I predict he will be a huge asset to SR.<br /><br />Good work my friend&nbsp; 8)

				So I thought I&#039;d share with you all my luck of late.... <br /><br />5 weeks ago, I decided to buy some good Meth. SR beckoned, I purchased..<br />I made three purchases, from two vendors. Weeks go past, infact 3, then 4, nothing.. It&#039;s ok though, things take a while to get down here. I&#039;m patient, so no problem. Then 5 weeks, then 6, nothing. Decide to message the vendors very politely. Nothing. I wait to again be polite.. Re-message a week later. Nothing.<br />Wait 2 more days, and get 1 message. Sorry. Nothing else.<br />Finally, two packages come, at 7 weeks. Now I don&#039;t mind the wait, I&#039;m not waiting by the letterbox or anything, but to not know is PAINFUL..<br />Adding to this I lost some money on investments due to Scam G**n**na pissing off with peoples coins in his shitty little sack..<br /><br />** Time passes **<br /><br />Along comes A0D as a vendor...<br />I message him. He messages back within 3 hrs.<br />I ask him if he can hold some stock. He obliges. Nothing is a inconvenience for him, he takes it in his stride. Good guy A0D :)<br />I thank him. I get back &quot;It&#039;s my pleasure&quot;. Nice. I get back to him a few days later, and ask him to relist. Answers within 30 mins &quot;can do, had to de-list to save some for you&quot; Gentleman..<br /><br />So nine days later, with great care and super careful stealth, arrival..<br />Here&#039;s my synopsis after thorough testing. My status, 10 yrs use, on and off (More on lately).<br />Smoked - 0.02g - Nice neck and head rushes, quick come up, clean feeling euphoria. Very in control and calmed all over. left 4 hours before re-dosing. <br />insufflate - 0.03g - Great body rush, tingles, very alert, wanted to hear my tunes on PC, very enjoyable..<br /><br />My ratings of my experience with A0D<br /><br />Communication - 5/5 (real reply in under 3 hours)<br />Stealth - 5/5 (Just trust it&#039;s safe)<br />Quality - 5/5 Super nicely packed as to not damage all shards, some great looking icicles of 2cm even. Burns forever, good rush, cracks right back to crystal nicely.<br />Value for money - 5/5 none better ATM.<br />Delivery time - 5/5 (9 days to you know where)<br /><br />Thanks A0D. You know how to grow business, a real professional. <br />You should be 100% rated still... <br /><br />Uber..

				Hey everyone! <br />A past buyer by the usernames &#039;blufields&#039;, &#039;joolz&#039; &amp; &#039;bobsmate&#039; (all the same person) is attempting to extort us with bad feedback so if you hear anything negative from him about us please ask us before you come to any conclusions. He received a full refund because the post office lost his order, which I did as a courtesy even though our terms of service clearly state that international orders are at your own risk. I guess it&#039;s time to make a &#039;banned buyer&#039; list :/ Was really hoping it wouldn&#039;t come to that.<br />

				Ordered again from AoD last week; had an insane week afterward and haven&#039;t gotten to come on here and post as I should have.<br /><br />AoD not only catered to my desiring a not a huge amount of product, but knew I was looking forward to having it in time for the weekend and threw in Express shipping rather than Priority since I&#039;m a ways away from AoD&#039;s shipping location.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I stand by my previous statement, why can&#039;t AoD be the only vendor I ever have to deal with on here?&nbsp; Now don&#039;t get me wrong, I have absolutely spoken to some lovely vendors under other circumstances, but AoD&#039;s service is something out of this world.&nbsp; Granted, we can not expect any vendor to service us at cost to them every time, and we should never become complacent or feel it&#039;s owed when it&#039;s anything beyond the product description of what we order, but that said, I genuinely appreciate what AoD has done to go out of their way for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did I mention the product (meth) was awesome and somehow lasted me even longer than the previous time?&nbsp; Hope to see you back soon because I don&#039;t want to order from someone else what I would rather come to you for!

				Another successful order from my favourite, AoD.&nbsp; AoD helps my broke ass out and the only way I really know how to repay the kindness is to pass the word on that there is a generous, considerate vendor and that not everyone who deals with hard drugs is an asshole.&nbsp; AoD is the farthest thing from an asshole.<br /><br />I can&#039;t stress enough that if you&#039;re a newbie to the road that AoD consistently provides the epitome of excellent customer service.<br /><br />AoD even has coke now!&nbsp; I&#039;m stoked to try it, I haven&#039;t bought coke on the Road yet and I know that everything I have been getting locally for the past several years is utter garbage, so I am excited to remember what good coke is like, which I am positive AoD will deliver.&nbsp; Now, if only AoD could press me some rolls so I wouldn&#039;t have to worry about this damn Netherlands nonsense.... :D&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again, if I never had to deal with another vendor, I would not.&nbsp; AoD is the hero that SR needs, debatable as to whether the one it deserves.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m a little sad about the price increase on the meth, but that is both business and life; with how much AoD goes out of the way to provide excellent customer service, I think the premium is more than worth it.&nbsp; Also, I hope everyone factors in that the Priority (or often in my experience Express!) shipping is thrown in, included with that price.&nbsp; Totally worth it.<br /><br />Also, whoever is extorting AoD for feedback needs to be punched in the junk.&nbsp; The end.

				Hi there! Just wanted to say thanks for all the helpful reviews. Really helps a newbie out! I&#039;ve been satisfied w/ my purchases from other vendors for the most part, but I like what I&#039;ve read here. AOD, you sound wonderful, and I&#039;d much prefer to spend my hard-earned coinage doing business w/ vendors who are honest, trustworthy, nice people. <br />I&#039;ve always been hesitant to try shrooms or anything psychedelic...will probably stick with my cola for now...but these reviews (one in particular lol) have made me want to take that plunge! And if I do, I will definitely be buying from you guys!

				Thanks everyone :) I&#039;m going to have to get a secretary pretty soon though, I&#039;d been awake for 6 days straight this past week between packing and mailing out orders and trying to stay on top of messages. Everything that has been ordered has been sent, bar a few things that will go out first thing monday morning. After that I&#039;ll be going stealth for a bit. I keep getting fucked by dishonest buyers so it might be a good while before I accept any new orders, as I&#039;m probably going to have to change some things around before I do. I&#039;ll be on torchat for the most part, idk why it didn&#039;t work for bobo, sorry about that man.

				AOD is the best vendor for me in quite a while, 11 days international post which is the way the post always used to be, the stealth is something not to worry about (especially compared to other vendors dealing with meth which can just be plain scary), so far from a small test the gear seems to be really nice it&#039;s got more getb up and go compared to the last few orders from different vendors, I will be ordering again straight away as it is a great relief&nbsp; not to be on edge about if the lack of stealth as with other vendors.<br />Order with confidence.<br />I will get some new glassware tomorrow and give a proper update on quality. <br />But as it stands so far they seem to be the best meth vendor for ages(I have tried most of them), nice to see people who take pride inn their work.

				I don&#039;t understand the person who gave AoD a 2/5 for their coke and the only back-up to say that the coke was cut was that it was powder, fuck I hate people who don&#039;t know shit about drugs and try and write some crap to make it sound like they know what they are talking about, either that or they are trying to get a freebie. I have not tried AoD&#039;s coke yet, but if you are gona give bad feedback back it up with something not juust that it is powder so it must be cut, coke is a powder compressed into&nbsp; a brick, you order 1gram you are probably gona get powder, it doesn&#039;t even sound like the fuck-wit tried it at least give a description of when you had a line.<br />I hate newbie wanna be&#039;s that are just trying to scam a free ride off a vendor that I have found to be one of the best in price delivery time stealth and product, I got an 8ball of meth and was happy in every way, scammers ruin good vendors for everyone because if a vendor is blackmailed by a shit cuuuustomer the vendor then has to increase his profits to compensate.<br />Thanks Aod I was happy with my overweight 8 ball and willl try your coke soon and leave honest feedback.<br />Some of us strive to be good customers and hopefully in return we find good safe reliable vendors who will make sure our packages are as stealth as possible and that are truthful on their product quality.<br />Well that&#039;s my rant, back up your scoring otherwise it looks like your a scammer that I hope no vendor will sell to<br />I have nothing to do with AoD I just hate people who take advantage of honest hard working vendors<br />Back to the pipe then

				Here is the feedback, what does anyone else think, at least cook some of, or ezy test it or maybe just snort it if a vendor is gona help anyone out it should be their honest reliable customers that appreciate the effort in their stealth and product not scammers who are out for a free ride. If this is your feedback prove me wrong and write some feedback with substance that it true<br /><br />2 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received order pretty fast, stealth is unique and real crazy but works. Only problem i have to admit it was all powder... So there is possibility of a lot of cut in it! Will test and update here n feedback too... Accordingly....<br /><br />*** it is all powder no smell seems like a cut agent. Sad to say this is not pure top notch coke like vendor claims... Will reach out to vendor and hear what he or she has to say! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />Vendor shoulod say fuck off and don&#039;t come back

And if BY any chance he&#039;s<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a little late he WILL have amazing communication, he even wrote a letter along with the order to explain to me why he was late, but it only took<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2-3 days for it to come so it wasn&#039;t even late at all if you ask me. This is truly a vendor that will stick around the road for years to come. He has yet<br />&nbsp; to ever get any bad reviews or a bad feedback on a problem that couldn&#039;t be solved. I have even recommended A.O.D to a friend IRL who&#039;s going to <br />&nbsp; buy cocaine from him next week.

				Hiya Nikki and anyone who is from the AOD. I ordered (Edited: Sizable quantity) grams with express shipping to the land of OZ on Wednesday last week. As per requested I did FE for the lot. I have messaged the account 4-5+ times since then to no response. I am unsure what is going on and there was not even a message as to why the account was going into stealth mode. It puts me in a very uncomfortable position after FE $1000 not to hear anything from the vendor in 4 days and to have his account put in stealth is really disconcerting. I was hoping you could help me clear up what is going on at the moment.

As for the stealth mode A.O.D went to do some errands to re stock so we will get back on listing in a while. Currently I don&#039;t know if your order has been shipped yet or what the status is on that. But I promise you I will find out and let you know via pm. Let me tell you I am sure your package is either waiting to be processed or on it&#039;s way.Any of A.O.D&#039;s deliveries are always delivered no matter what. It might take a while due to distance depending where you live but it will get there. You just got to remember A.O.D&#039;s got your back we aim to satisfy and please each customer. I&#039;m very sorry for the delay please feel free to PM me or torchat me on any other questions. If worse were to come to worse I&#039;m positive you will get a refund,so just relax and be patient.<br />

				Out of interest Nikki, are you actually part of the AOD operation? I could ask A.O.D this myself as we have certain connections that you wouldn&#039;t know about - but we speak only when needed and we don&#039;t unless certain things occur. But as it happens I will be speaking to him within a day or so as something has cropped up. <br /><br />Because It looks very much like he give&#039;s you the odd bit of free product and gets you to do all the promotion (dirty work) etc...<br /><br /><br />He&#039;s not stupid is our A.O.D. - and if my suspicions are true and I&#039;m certain they are as I know how business minded he is, it&#039;s a nice shrewd move by A.O.D. <br /><br />Feel free to ask him about me as I have nothing to worry about with regards to our connection as I am by no means part of his operation and have no connection to his operation, we just have certain things that connect us in certain ways.<br /><br /><br />Tell me to fuck off and mind my own business, if you want, that&#039;s cool.<br /><br />But A.O.D. if you&#039;re reading this, I&#039;ll be in touch very soon and I like your style!!

I don&#039;t even have a nickname on torchat just my default ID.&nbsp; And if I were to ever tell you &#039;&#039;BE PATIENT&#039;&#039; in caps lock it is because you have asked me for the tracking number over thirty times. I helped enough to tell you the date it was sent and you still weren&#039;t satisfied. I tried to explain to you how plenty of packages have gotten delayed but they will be shipped out. You just were being completely obnoxious and rude and hassling me about the tracking number. You can eve ask A.O.D himself when I was chatting with you I specially told him I was talking to a very rude customer. Didn&#039;t say your name though but I&#039;m sure he knew it was you since I kept asking him for the tracking number FOR YOU. I&#039;ll say it for the last time we can&#039;t keep track of every single tracking number. If you can&#039;t be patient and wait for your package to come then I don&#039;t know what to tell you. Somethings aren&#039;t vendors fault it,some of it depends on the service of the delivery. Good day to you.

				I&#039;m not saying it is your responsibility, but being a secretary (or even part of the A.O.D team) people are always going to come to you with their issues - and you should be in a position to be able to give the customers the information they deserve. Are you even in contact with A.O.D when he&#039;s in stealth mode? Or are you just trying to hold the ship together until he returns? <br /><br />Like I said a while back - a shrewd move by A.O.D.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m only giving an unbiased view of how I would feel if I was the customer in question, he paid for tracking and FE on $1000 - yet nearly 2 weeks later he is nowhere nearer to even knowing where his order is. Personally I would be fuming...wouldn&#039;t you?? Luckily enough I never FE so it wouldn&#039;t be an issue for me personally.

				I just wanted to say thanks to the wonderful team at A.O.D! I was the winner of their lottery giveaway last week and chose a sample of their shrooms. Their communication was excellent and very friendly! They made sure that I got the sample that I wanted and even offered me a choice of strains! The shrooms shipped from the West Coast on Wednesday and arrived at my door on Friday! The stealth packaging was awesome, definitely 5/5! I don&#039;t see their packages ever getting intercepted. As for the sample, they were extremely generous! They gave me over a quarter of beautiful, dried P.E. Cubensis mushrooms.&nbsp; Another 5/5. I dug in as soon as they got here and had a wonderful day trip! I will definitely be ordering from the A.O.D. team in the near future! Thanks again guys!!<br /><br />Communication 5/5<br />Stealth 5/5<br />Speed of Shipping 10/5<br />Quality of Product 5/5<br />Overall 6/5<br /><br />Extremely pleased!

				Yo 4sakn,<br /><br />I know the FE feeling ordering 1000 + bucks worth of gear to oz, and I really fucken understand ur anxieties about it&#039;s whereabouts and arrival. Let me hopefully ease ur worries a bit - I&#039;ve had a couple of grand in orders from AOD to Aus. They have all (3) made it. I&#039;ve had an issue with 1 of them in terms of quality.<br />I made contact with Nikki via Torchat, and mate, she will do her utmost to try and help u man.<br /><br />AOD has stated on his page &#039;some shit went down,&#039; and although I know that is vague as fuck, he ain&#039;t about to go into detail on here or SR site. However, ( and I may be misguided in my belief AoD will make good on his word,) I&#039;ve had quite a few convo&#039;s with him prior to this &#039; shit going down&#039; , and I believe he will come through and you will receive ur product and I will resolve my quality issue with him.<br /><br />The world of selling drugs is inherently risky man, shit going down could mean anything, which again ain&#039;t gonna make u feel better till u get ur gear, but this guy is either gonna come good as soon as he is clear of whatever shit is that&#039;s in the way right now, or he&#039;s gonna loose all reputation and everything he&#039;s been working so fucking hard to build. Can u imagine the patience it would take to deal with a hundred mother fuckers such as u or I on a daily basis? That either takes a quality human being, or one fucking talented, calculating scammer.<br /><br />I personally believe at this point in time it is still the former, and although his communication hasn&#039;t been what it was prior to the last week or so, I think that Nikki has done a fucking exceptional job considering the position she&#039;s in.<br /><br />I think give AOD till the end of this week, in the meantime, maybe hit up a couple of other vendors that ship to Aus, but I definitely vouch for AOD&#039;s stealth and skill at getting shit to Aus, and the latest shipment of his gear was fucking grouse, so I&#039;m really hoping u get ur package bro, but in places like this , you gotta prepare yourself for the possibility it may not come, and if/when the time comes that beyond doubt you&#039;ve been fucked over, post whatever you like cos scamming fucks should be outed. On the other hand if/when ur AOD order arrives and the gear is mad, let peeps know that too, but until either occurs, I&#039;d try to stick to more private channels of communication - Just my opinion, take or leave it mate

				Hey All,<br /><br />First post on this forum so thought it was only fair to kick off with a brief, belated review of my first AoD (+SR) purchase.<br /><br />Being a freshman in the world dark web e-commerce and not a single feedback point. I took a chance and used AoD, a 5 week vendor at the time.&nbsp; It was his prices that lured me at first but after reading his profile and feedback from other buyers. I was confident enough to put my trust in him with my first FE purchase.<br /><br />Post transaction reply was received within a few hours. Great! My package containing (x) amount of Shardonnay was en route down under.<br /><br />Generally any online purchase from U.S.A is put straight to the back of shortly after checkout, so you can imagine my shock when it arrived in only 8 DAYS!! INCLUDING A WEEKEND! <br /><br />The packaging itself was very discreet and professional with incredible stealth. <br /><br />Quality of the package contents was nothing short of amazing. I have sampled many varieties of the product in question and would have to say it is up in the top in terms of appearance, affects and characteristics. <br /><br />I could go on all day about my experience with AoD but prefer to keep it simple am not one to ramble on. <br /><br />I wouldnt hesitate for a second to purchase again from AoD. <br /><br />Keep up the good work bud and I look forward to throwing a few more coins at you when the dust settles ;)<br /><br />Which brings me to a question for Nikki... Have you got an ETA on the store reopening? <br /><br />

When I smelt it it didnt smell quiet right, so i tried it.. Nothing. Absolutely NO Effect at all..<br /><br />So I took out a EZ Tester and I got this result:<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Dnvi.jpg<br /><br />NO REACTION. Which means NO COKE. Not 1 Single Bit of Coke. I have been sold complete bunk. I did the cuts test and had a very small reaction towards ephirine, but even that (not that you want it) was only a slight reaction. most of it was inactive powder!<br /><br />I WAS COMPLETELY AN UTTERLY SCAMMED.<br /><br />AoDs Ice<br />------------<br />His ice was a little better than his coke. However it still had a disgusting taste on the first couple of smokes.. After that it would taste like actual ice, this was, after the cut has burnt off.<br /><br />Over all there is much better quality elsewhere.

I myself have tested and sampled A.O.D&#039;s latest and only batch of cocaine before the RESTOCK (Which is why he is in stealth) . And the cocaine is nothing but the quality you pay for. It is not the purest cocaine I have tested but it is very fine quality. First the link you provided in your thread to the picture doesn&#039;t display anything. So either it&#039;s not letting me see the picture or there is no picture of proof. Second A.O.D has never scammed or left someone unrefunded as I work for A.O.D and I myself keep a folder of cases which something has gone bad or a refund needed to be issue. And their hasn&#039;t been one single case where the customer doesn&#039;t leave happy. A.O.D has made it more than clear to see if you have a question or problem you torchat or PM me which is why he hasn&#039;t responded to you at all. It is such a shame to see that your business with us had to end you creating false information on our thread I am more than 100% sure we could&#039;ve resolved it. <br />Also I find it odd how your ice was fine but your coke wasn&#039;t? Why would A.O.D scam you off of the coke when the ice is clearly more expensive? If you ever actually tested the coke and it came out like that I&#039;m sure it&#039;s some sort of error or false test results. Because by first hand experience I KNOW for a fact A.O.D&#039;s coke is not bunk at all.<br /><br />@NoYouDont, Before you spread anything or judge you might want to see other feedback and seek more information before you spread false rumors.<br /><br /><br />Here at A.O.D we will never in no way scam any customer or business associate.We will try our best to always leave you with a smile and fully satisfied.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />my torchat is&nbsp; gia27efhieyboqa2<br /><br />I have been trying to get a response from you or AoD for 5 days now.<br /><br />I dont know how i was sent a product that has 0% cocaine in it..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is that so? because it seems you&#039;ve been offline for quiet a while yes I just seen a delayed message I had from you but I will assure you I am online torchat almost 24/7 .

				I have now seen replies to AOD with terrible reviews on his product. I have waited 2 weeks for my product after paying $150 for express tracked 5 day shipping. And I am yet to have it arrive. Now I hear that the product is incredibly cut (Or atleast the last batch was) and I am really worried that I am going to either (A) Not recieve my shipment at all and because I had to FE not even recieve a refund due to AODs being offline for over a week or (B) when it does arrive I will have to deal with a poor quality product. I was upset a few days ago and said some unnecessary things towards this company because of my time waiting. I let it go and just trusted that AOD would come through for me and I still do. I am just crossing every finger and every toe that this product arrives quickly and quality I deserve otherwise people I now owe product are going to make my life really hard.

Now 4sakn I have done everything in my power to get you a shipping update or any type of update in general on the package.The big man himself (A.O.D) is extremely extremely busy with personal life errands,re stocking on products + new products will be added to the listings. We haven&#039;t scammed one single person I am sure the current conflicts going on will be resolved. A.O.D has worked and worked very hard to proper feedback and support he deserves. From very simple promotion to sending out free products, to even hosting a monthly lottery! I mean what type of vendor does that,surely a couple but it is very rare. We would not ever in any case selective scam so you have nothing to worry about. A. I&#039;m afraid your package was seized. B. It simply hasn&#039;t arrived yet. C. worst case scenario it didn&#039;t make it to your house. Now the thing that bothered me a bit 4sakn is I have told you over twenty times the only thing I could do about it to help and I have done my part and you continue to ask. It is fine with me and I understand how you owe people money so this is of top priority for you to know. But you must understand I am only the secretary it is A.O.D who makes the big power moves and has most of the customers package information.that is until I get my operation set up. So please all I can ask of you is to try and bare with us and be a bit patient. I don&#039;t know whats been up with the random negative feedback on the coke (3 negative feedbacks including this one.) One apparently the product is bunk,the other the same, and you with the shipping. On the two bunk products I am not sure if those are lies but either way THEY WILL get resolved and refunded that is how great we are at A.O.D We could be losing plenty of money from our pockets but yet we love the customer so much we do things like that. And I ASSURE YOU if the package doesn&#039;t arrive in twenty one days and it is not marked delivered you will be reshipped or refunded. <br />A lot of customers seem to try to break such a loyal and honest&#039;s vendors rep just like that in the matter of a day. I find that so wrong on so many levels and than they think it&#039;s all okay by leaving a sorry message? ONCE a rep is tainted it won&#039;t ever be the same for the vendor or newcomer customers. SO PLEASE to anyone before leaving nasty disgusting feed back even if you have waited patiently and no one has reply PLEASE be extra patient and think about what you are doing.

I have waited 2 weeks for my product after paying $150 for express tracked 5 day shipping. And I am yet to have it arrive. Now I hear that the product is incredibly cut (Or atleast the last batch was) and I am really worried that I am going to either (A) Not recieve my shipment at all and because I had to FE not even recieve a refund due to AODs being offline for over a week or (B) when it does arrive I will have to deal with a poor quality product. I was upset a few days ago and said some unnecessary things towards this company because of my time waiting. I let it go and just trusted that AOD would come through for me and I still do. I am just crossing every finger and every toe that this product arrives quickly and quality I deserve otherwise people I now owe product are going to make my life really hard. Please AOD I really need to see something and soon or else you might not hear from me again. Alot of peoples money went into this. Alot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We really do not have no mind as to how &#039;&#039;GUS&#039;S&#039;&#039; batch was &#039;&#039;cut&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;INSIDETHESUN&#039;&#039; wasn&#039;t if it was the same batch. Now 4sakn I have done everything in my power to get you a shipping update or any type of update in general on the package.The big man himself (A.O.D) is extremely extremely busy with personal life errands,re stocking on products + new products will be added to the listings. We haven&#039;t scammed one single person I am sure the current conflicts going on will be resolved. A.O.D has worked and worked very hard to proper feedback and support he deserves. From very simple promotion to sending out free products, to even hosting a monthly lottery! I mean what type of vendor does that,surely a couple but it is very rare. We would not ever in any case selective scam so you have nothing to worry about. A. I&#039;m afraid your package was seized. B. It simply hasn&#039;t arrived yet. C. worst case scenario it didn&#039;t make it to your house. Now the thing that bothered me a bit 4sakn is I have told you over twenty times the only thing I could do about it to help and I have done my part and you continue to ask. It is fine with me and I understand how you owe people money so this is of top priority for you to know. But you must understand I am only the secretary it is A.O.D who makes the big power moves and has most of the customers package information.that is until I get my operation set up. So please all I can ask of you is to try and bare with us and be a bit patient. I don&#039;t know whats been up with the random negative feedback on the coke (3 negative feedbacks including this one.) One apparently the product is bunk,the other the same, and you with the shipping. On the two bunk products I am not sure if those are lies but either way THEY WILL get resolved and refunded that is how great we are at A.O.D We could be losing plenty of money from our pockets but yet we love the customer so much we do things like that. And I ASSURE YOU if the package doesn&#039;t arrive in twenty one days and it is not marked delivered you will be reshipped or refunded. <br />A lot of customers seem to try to break such a loyal and honest&#039;s vendors rep just like that in the matter of a day.

Delivery times vary but even the most remote locations usually receive their orders within 14 business days. You are eligible for the aforementioned refund/reship pollcy after 21 days.&#039;&#039; - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6a1a8a7aea&nbsp; ( STRAIGHT FROM THE VENDOR PAGE.)<br /><br />I have no clue how some people have the AUDACITY to try and tarnish someones hard worked reputation out of impatience and no response. Including when it hasn&#039;t been the twenty one day mark. Yet you claim that you have tried everything but seem to haven&#039;t even read thru the A.O.D Q &amp; A. I would take this at a lighter approach but I&#039;ve noticed how much hate and disgusting things you have been spreading about the company. I mean come on I understand that SOMEHOW THE SAME BATCH YOU GOT is BUNK when &#039;&#039;INSIDETHESUN&#039;S&#039;&#039; SAME BATCH isn&#039;t BUNK. But SOMEHOW! hey gus you got the a bunk batch &#039;&#039;SOMEHOW.&#039;&#039; It happen and you didn&#039;t get response in six days or so and you got so &#039;&#039;pissed&#039;&#039; you had to try and tarnish our reputation even put it in your signature haha. You know I no longer care for my feedback on these forums I am going to keep it one hundred percent honest and real all the way. And I am very sorry if I sound unprofessional but I am a human not a automated answering service. The only reason I am not calling a fraud claim on your behalf is because you have what it appears to be excellent reputation on these forums so I will leave it at that. I feel that not everything is all friendships and good vibes on the community. Their are plenty of snakes and scammers here that will do anything to get the bang for their buck or something free! Do you people really think here at A.O.D we would scam when we host our OWN montlhy lottery sample event??? I mean come on really? This is all I will say about the situation. Oh last thing I find it quiet amusing Gus how you said you&#039;ve tried everything to communicate with me but you never even PM&#039;d me VIA forums until I told you to do so.&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br /><br />-Nikki!

				I can confirm everything GUS has been saying here as we&#039;ve been in discussion about it since the &#039;coke&#039; arrived. I&#039;m happy to stand behind his words because I&#039;ve seen him systematically go through and review just about every coke vendor that ships internationally and this is the first time he&#039;s ever said any of it was completely bunk. <br /><br />If that wasn&#039;t enough, GUS actually sent me a small sample of the cocaine he received from AoD as well. All I can say is that if this wasn&#039;t intended for human consumption, I would laugh. Tried dissolving a bit in a glass of water at first only to have it fail completely and just kind of sit on the bottom, then for the a bit on the gums and up the nose. <br /><br />On the gums, it tasted quite bad but had little to no numbing whatsoever. And up the nose, pretty much the same. No real effect whatsoever. I was expecting at least a bit of cutter but it seems this is for the most part at least inactive powder. <br /><br />This doesn&#039;t have to be a another drama-filled saga, we&#039;re all in the same boat. Regardless of the circumstances leading to this being sent out to people, it would really be great to run each new batch past an EZ test in future. It would save us all a lot of hassle.

				AmericaOnDrug has resolved my issue 100%<br /><br />He had real world issues which caused the delay in responding and he was also fucked over&nbsp; by the coke.<br /><br />I am very happy with the resolution and thank him for resolving it promptly.<br /><br />these things happen, its just a shame that he didnt communicate earlier, however sometimes real&nbsp; life gets in the way

				Wow, what the fuck happened while I was gone??&nbsp; Hope it gets sorted for you, AoD, for I am here to spread the joy of what I experienced from my most recent order from the AoD team.<br /><br />Below is my life&#039;s story (okay, just the backstory to this order) and a review.&nbsp; I will post &quot;REVIEW TIME&quot; directly above the review portion, should you care to have it somewhat abridged, but I&#039;ll warn you I&#039;m a talker no matter what.<br /><br />AoD knew I had a vacation coming up, I was going to Vegas, to a large music festival that I&#039;m sure a few of you here know about and have enjoyed yourselves.&nbsp; I asked AoD if they would be willing and able to create a mixed package for me so I could just have a bunch of uppers to sample from whilst out in Las Vegas, which AoD was happy to oblige, being the serviceman/woman that they always are.<br /><br />Placed my order on Wednesday, thinking it&#039;d ship here by Monday with Priority (I&#039;m on the opposite coast from AoD, which is very unfortunate in itself, but hopefully I&#039;ll change that someday since this place sucks).&nbsp; I waited around and was upset to see it hadn&#039;t come on Monday.&nbsp; I checked with AoD and Nikki, who verified it was marked as delivered.&nbsp; I trust AoD 100%, having dealt with them several times here and having absolutely NO issues.&nbsp; The address I shipped this package to is in a type of area where it isn&#039;t possible for the package to have been left out at the door and snatched or anything of that nature.&nbsp; So, sadly, my options were to hope that the post office erroneously marked it as delivered when it wasn&#039;t put on the truck until the next day, or to pray that the rental office at this particular property had the package, despite having checked there already twice and their having said there was nothing there for me.&nbsp; Long story short, I checked with the rental office bright and early Tuesday morning and insisted they go through every single package and AoD had done some awesome packaging on this one and it was much larger than normal, we found it sitting around on its lonesome in the package area.&nbsp; I promptly ran home to write AoD and Nikki a profuse apology for having not received it from the rental office sooner and I will henceforth be personally inspecting all packages&#039; labels myself, should I need to check there again.<br /><br />The packaging on this was phenomenal.&nbsp; I wanted to cry when I saw how much AoD had paid for the Express shipping on a large parcel, which arrived on Saturday and should have been in my hands then, had the office not dropped the ball (still butthurt about that, sorry).&nbsp; There were layers and layers securing my product and the outside world.&nbsp; The concept of this particular one was novel and unique, I absolutely adored it!&nbsp; I sadly had to destroy its exterior when trying to reach the goodness within, but it was well worth doing so.<br /><br />REVIEW TIME:<br /><br />Three products were received in this order from AoD: coke, meth, and MDMA.&nbsp; The only product of AoD&#039;s which I have had before is the meth, and I&#039;ve had it plenty of times from AoD, so my review will be sparse on that.&nbsp; The other two are what I am really here to praise.<br /><br />COKE: The coke arrived in one solid chunk, save for a few crumbles that rolled around elsewhere.&nbsp; I read something on here about a bad batch of coke?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think mine was from that and if it was, then please let me know when the good batch comes in so I can cash in my 401k and buy out the stock.&nbsp; The coke was easily the best I&#039;ve had in years, since maybe 2006-ish.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t fishscale in its appearance, but it had the cleanliness and taste of it.&nbsp; No burn when snorting, somewhat moist and clumpy, definitely need a razor blade to get it into a fine powder.&nbsp; The high from it was absolutely wonderful for coke; it did not have any kind of tweakiness or edginess at any point, even the comedown.&nbsp; I find that meth has less harsh of a comedown for me (not sure whether that is odd or not), but I would happily spend money on this coke again, it was fantastic.&nbsp; Again, very curious to know whether this was part of the &#039;bad&#039; batch.&nbsp; The high itself is very subtle, which is how I like my coke to be, rather than knocking you off your ass and melting your face while you scream at people.&nbsp; It made me more sociable and just pleasant feeling without any trace of edginess.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t bought coke from SR before, but I have done it hundreds if not thousands of times in my life, and this was in the top ten I have ever done, easily.&nbsp; I definitely wish I had bought more for the trip!<br /><br />MDMA (molly):&nbsp; Again, received in one very large, brown sugar-like chunk.&nbsp; The core brown pile was coated in crystaline shards, which may have been meth since the meth somehow escaped its initial hiding place in transit.&nbsp; I had never done brown MDMA before (to my knowledge; I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve popped some in a club without really looking at them before), so I was very apprehensive.&nbsp; I did, however, get some MDMA/MDA combination caps from vendor ForeverJung recently that had a very similar looking product within and those caps were absolutely excellent.&nbsp; Due to my apprehension to try this product, I tried to find an experienced roller to sample for me the night before the first night of the festival, but to no avail.&nbsp; How many of you know people that turn down free MDMA that is from a very trusted source when you only want to have them check the potency of the roll?<br /><br />As it happens, I&#039;m surrounded by absolute morons because AoD&#039;s molly blew me out of the water.&nbsp; I really didn&#039;t expect a whole lot from it for whatever reason, I suppose since I had been up doing meth for a couple of days by the time I tried it Friday evening, save for only two hours of sleep that day.&nbsp; Despite those conditions stacking against me, everyone who tried it (four of us total) had an absolutely excellent roll.&nbsp; My better half&nbsp; and I both dropped only one dose the entire evening at the festival (probably about 150 mg at the very most, maybe closer to 100-120 mg) and it lasted from 11 PM to about 4 AM as an intense but not at all unpleasant roll.&nbsp; The visuals of the stages at the festival were out of this world whether you were sober or rolling, so while rolling, it was just breathtaking.&nbsp; The roll gave me plenty of energy; sitting on the ground was nice, but standing and walking were not burdensome in the least.&nbsp; This is the complete opposite of what I felt when trying the other kind of molly that I had for the weekend on the later nights, which I am not certain whether to attribute to product or that I had tried to roll together so soon, as I normally wait at the absolute least one week between rolls.&nbsp; My friends who stayed with me were devastated that we had run out of AoD&#039;s molly and had to switch over to the other stuff we brought.&nbsp; I would really like to stock up on that product while I can and I&#039;m hoping AoD opens up shop again soon so that I can do so, I would highly recommend that anyone try the MDMA from AoD; while I can&#039;t vouch for SR coke quality, I can say with confidence that AoD&#039;s is the best molly/ecstasy product I have bought on the road, probably ever, and can be compared to SuperTrips&#039; pills but honestly probably a little better and not overwhelming.&nbsp; AoD, sorry for not having more faith in it to begin with, but you have a believer now!<br /><br />Needless to say, my heart is heavy that I have almost 3 grams of the other product I had purchased on here from who was reported to be one of the best domestic vendors for MDMA at this time and I frankly don&#039;t care for their product, which when taken on the second night of the festival made all noises irritating and entirely too loud, visuals extra bright rather than just the usual intensity of ecstasy (made me feel like I was rolling in direct sunlight).&nbsp; Can I get an exchange slip, please?<br /><br />METH: The meth, as mentioned earlier, arrived broken up and had gotten in places it shouldn&#039;t, which please understand is not nearly as bad as it sounds.&nbsp; AoD packaged this as a custom order and not their standard sealing packaging.&nbsp; The three products arrived in the same box, with small dividers.&nbsp; Hopefully I&#039;m not divulging too much information and I do not wish to do so, so I will leave it at that.&nbsp; The meth having gotten into the other areas is completely understandable given the way it was packaged and you do not need to worry about your product having this happen.&nbsp; I did let AoD know about this and how I think it could easily be remedied, should they choose to package this way again, it&#039;s an easy fix.<br /><br />The product itself is on par with other meth I have gotten from AoD and other vendors on the road.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t the absolute strongest batch, but it is by no means garbage or terrible, as I am seeing some people comment.&nbsp; It was very easy to distinguish the three products from one another in the aforementioned container despite crossover, and all of the meth was crystaline and shardy, even if small shards.&nbsp; There was absolutely no powder cut; the only powder was very obviously granules of the coke, the clumps were too large and on their own for it to be meth cut, not to mention damp like the coke.&nbsp; The product sniffs the same as other meth I have done and has about the same potency/duration of AoD&#039;s usual, which everyone knows I am a fan of.&nbsp; So, nothing new there, AoD still delivering me meth that more than gets the job done.<br /><br />There you have it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the story of how AoD saved Vegas.&nbsp; I hope everything gets sorted for you soon, AoD team, and I thank you again for the wonderful experience (and memories..and memories somewhat hindered by drug use but no regrets there) and apologize for the bullshit with the delay on my receipt of delivery.&nbsp;

				Hey Nikki, I know I am one of probably quite a few dozen people who are hoping for a resolution but I was hoping that AOD might be able to help me with my problem. A couple of other buyers have said to wait until today before I messaged again. But I am just really hoping for a quick response about what is going on with my package. <br /><br />Regards Forsakn

I really didn&#039;t expect a whole lot from it for whatever reason, I suppose since I had been up doing meth for a couple of days by the time I tried it Friday evening, save for only two hours of sleep that day.&nbsp; Despite those conditions stacking against me, everyone who tried it (four of us total) had an absolutely excellent roll.&nbsp; My better half&nbsp; and I both dropped only one dose the entire evening at the festival (probably about 150 mg at the very most, maybe closer to 100-120 mg) and it lasted from 11 PM to about 4 AM as an intense but not at all unpleasant roll.&nbsp; The visuals of the stages at the festival were out of this world whether you were sober or rolling, so while rolling, it was just breathtaking.&nbsp; The roll gave me plenty of energy; sitting on the ground was nice, but standing and walking were not burdensome in the least.&nbsp; This is the complete opposite of what I felt when trying the other kind of molly that I had for the weekend on the later nights, which I am not certain whether to attribute to product or that I had tried to roll together so soon, as I normally wait at the absolute least one week between rolls.&nbsp; My friends who stayed with me were devastated that we had run out of AoD&#039;s molly and had to switch over to the other stuff we brought.&nbsp; I would really like to stock up on that product while I can and I&#039;m hoping AoD opens up shop again soon so that I can do so, I would highly recommend that anyone try the MDMA from AoD; while I can&#039;t vouch for SR coke quality, I can say with confidence that AoD&#039;s is the best molly/ecstasy product I have bought on the road, probably ever, and can be compared to SuperTrips&#039; pills but honestly probably a little better and not overwhelming.&nbsp; AoD, sorry for not having more faith in it to begin with, but you have a believer now!<br /><br />Needless to say, my heart is heavy that I have almost 3 grams of the other product I had purchased on here from who was reported to be one of the best domestic vendors for MDMA at this time and I frankly don&#039;t care for their product, which when taken on the second night of the festival made all noises irritating and entirely too loud, visuals extra bright rather than just the usual intensity of ecstasy (made me feel like I was rolling in direct sunlight).&nbsp; Can I get an exchange slip, please?<br /><br />METH: The meth, as mentioned earlier, arrived broken up and had gotten in places it shouldn&#039;t, which please understand is not nearly as bad as it sounds.&nbsp; AoD packaged this as a custom order and not their standard sealing packaging.&nbsp; The three products arrived in the same box, with small dividers.&nbsp; Hopefully I&#039;m not divulging too much information and I do not wish to do so, so I will leave it at that.&nbsp; The meth having gotten into the other areas is completely understandable given the way it was packaged and you do not need to worry about your product having this happen.&nbsp; I did let AoD know about this and how I think it could easily be remedied, should they choose to package this way again, it&#039;s an easy fix.<br /><br />The product itself is on par with other meth I have gotten from AoD and other vendors on the road.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t the absolute strongest batch, but it is by no means garbage or terrible, as I am seeing some people comment.&nbsp; It was very easy to distinguish the three products from one another in the aforementioned container despite crossover, and all of the meth was crystaline and shardy, even if small shards.&nbsp; There was absolutely no powder cut; the only powder was very obviously granules of the coke, the clumps were too large and on their own for it to be meth cut, not to mention damp like the coke.&nbsp; The product sniffs the same as other meth I have done and has about the same potency/duration of AoD&#039;s usual, which everyone knows I am a fan of.&nbsp; So, nothing new there, AoD still delivering me meth that more than gets the job done.<br /><br />There you have it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the story of how AoD saved Vegas.&nbsp; I hope everything gets sorted for you soon, AoD team, and I thank you again for the wonderful experience (and memories..and memories somewhat hindered by drug use but no regrets there) and apologize for the bullshit with the delay on my receipt of delivery.&nbsp;

				Hi Nikki/AOD, I ordered 1.75 g&#039;s international on the 7th June, shipped on the 9th June and am yet to receive and was wondering if anything can be done to be checked on this order? If tracking could be provided that would be fantastic!<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				What is going on?<br /><br />I ordered $1000 worth of shardonay on the 12th of last month, I even paid for express ($150) shipping to guarantee 3-5 day delivery.&nbsp; I have waited for 20 days, Almost 5 times the delivery guarantee. I am really stressing out because as of 8pm tonight I have someone threatening my safety because of this delay. I have done everything I can to assure this went off without a hitch to no avail. I even was promised by Nikki I would have been contacted by AOD or herself BEFORE Monday to receive a tracking number and confirmation that I have infact been reshipped to. It is now Tuesday and I am yet to hear anything infact Nikki has stopped even posting to the forum wall. I am getting really stressed out and worried about my health as of 8pm. THIS IS NOT OK, THIS IS NEVER OK. PLEASE REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

Hope it gets sorted for you, AoD, for I am here to spread the joy of what I experienced from my most recent order from the AoD team.<br /><br />Below is my life&#039;s story (okay, just the backstory to this order) and a review.&nbsp; I will post &quot;REVIEW TIME&quot; directly above the review portion, should you care to have it somewhat abridged, but I&#039;ll warn you I&#039;m a talker no matter what.<br /><br />AoD knew I had a vacation coming up, I was going to Vegas, to a large music festival that I&#039;m sure a few of you here know about and have enjoyed yourselves.&nbsp; I asked AoD if they would be willing and able to create a mixed package for me so I could just have a bunch of uppers to sample from whilst out in Las Vegas, which AoD was happy to oblige, being the serviceman/woman that they always are.<br /><br />Placed my order on Wednesday, thinking it&#039;d ship here by Monday with Priority (I&#039;m on the opposite coast from AoD, which is very unfortunate in itself, but hopefully I&#039;ll change that someday since this place sucks).&nbsp; I waited around and was upset to see it hadn&#039;t come on Monday.&nbsp; I checked with AoD and Nikki, who verified it was marked as delivered.&nbsp; I trust AoD 100%, having dealt with them several times here and having absolutely NO issues.&nbsp; The address I shipped this package to is in a type of area where it isn&#039;t possible for the package to have been left out at the door and snatched or anything of that nature.&nbsp; So, sadly, my options were to hope that the post office erroneously marked it as delivered when it wasn&#039;t put on the truck until the next day, or to pray that the rental office at this particular property had the package, despite having checked there already twice and their having said there was nothing there for me.&nbsp; Long story short, I checked with the rental office bright and early Tuesday morning and insisted they go through every single package and AoD had done some awesome packaging on this one and it was much larger than normal, we found it sitting around on its lonesome in the package area.&nbsp; I promptly ran home to write AoD and Nikki a profuse apology for having not received it from the rental office sooner and I will henceforth be personally inspecting all packages&#039; labels myself, should I need to check there again.<br /><br />The packaging on this was phenomenal.&nbsp; I wanted to cry when I saw how much AoD had paid for the Express shipping on a large parcel, which arrived on Saturday and should have been in my hands then, had the office not dropped the ball (still butthurt about that, sorry).&nbsp; There were layers and layers securing my product and the outside world.&nbsp; The concept of this particular one was novel and unique, I absolutely adored it!&nbsp; I sadly had to destroy its exterior when trying to reach the goodness within, but it was well worth doing so.<br /><br />REVIEW TIME:<br /><br />Three products were received in this order from AoD: coke, meth, and MDMA.&nbsp; The only product of AoD&#039;s which I have had before is the meth, and I&#039;ve had it plenty of times from AoD, so my review will be sparse on that.&nbsp; The other two are what I am really here to praise.<br /><br />COKE: The coke arrived in one solid chunk, save for a few crumbles that rolled around elsewhere.&nbsp; I read something on here about a bad batch of coke?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think mine was from that and if it was, then please let me know when the good batch comes in so I can cash in my 401k and buy out the stock.&nbsp; The coke was easily the best I&#039;ve had in years, since maybe 2006-ish.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t fishscale in its appearance, but it had the cleanliness and taste of it.&nbsp; No burn when snorting, somewhat moist and clumpy, definitely need a razor blade to get it into a fine powder.&nbsp; The high from it was absolutely wonderful for coke; it did not have any kind of tweakiness or edginess at any point, even the comedown.&nbsp; I find that meth has less harsh of a comedown for me (not sure whether that is odd or not), but I would happily spend money on this coke again, it was fantastic.&nbsp; Again, very curious to know whether this was part of the &#039;bad&#039; batch.&nbsp; The high itself is very subtle, which is how I like my coke to be, rather than knocking you off your ass and melting your face while you scream at people.&nbsp; It made me more sociable and just pleasant feeling without any trace of edginess.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t bought coke from SR before, but I have done it hundreds if not thousands of times in my life, and this was in the top ten I have ever done, easily.&nbsp; I definitely wish I had bought more for the trip!<br /><br />MDMA (molly):&nbsp; Again, received in one very large, brown sugar-like chunk.&nbsp; The core brown pile was coated in crystaline shards, which may have been meth since the meth somehow escaped its initial hiding place in transit.&nbsp; I had never done brown MDMA before (to my knowledge; I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve popped some in a club without really looking at them before), so I was very apprehensive.&nbsp; I did, however, get some MDMA/MDA combination caps from vendor ForeverJung recently that had a very similar looking product within and those caps were absolutely excellent.&nbsp; Due to my apprehension to try this product, I tried to find an experienced roller to sample for me the night before the first night of the festival, but to no avail.&nbsp; How many of you know people that turn down free MDMA that is from a very trusted source when you only want to have them check the potency of the roll?<br /><br />As it happens, I&#039;m surrounded by absolute morons because AoD&#039;s molly blew me out of the water.&nbsp; I really didn&#039;t expect a whole lot from it for whatever reason, I suppose since I had been up doing meth for a couple of days by the time I tried it Friday evening, save for only two hours of sleep that day.&nbsp; Despite those conditions stacking against me, everyone who tried it (four of us total) had an absolutely excellent roll.&nbsp; My better half&nbsp; and I both dropped only one dose the entire evening at the festival (probably about 150 mg at the very most, maybe closer to 100-120 mg) and it lasted from 11 PM to about 4 AM as an intense but not at all unpleasant roll.&nbsp;

As for the &quot;cut&quot; I don&#039;t cook the product myself, nor do I cut it personally but I source from a number of different locations so purity is going to vary until I find one source who can be consistent and meet demand. 4sakn, I&#039;m sorry but I&#039;m not willing to ship you the same order three times. Sorry but that&#039;s ridiculous, and you said you were very happy with the product and then did a 180.. that makes me rather suspicious. Sorry mate, you should probably consider ordering from a domestic vendor in the future.

A few weeks go by, I begin to doubt that this will occur, or that anything would come of the word of an anonymous meth dealer )A month or so goes by, and I get a message from the man ( or woman) him ( or her) self, asking how much gear he (or she) owes me and can I please send through an address.<br /><br />HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD A DEALER SEEK YOU OUT TO MAKE GOOD ON A PROMISE OR A BAD BATCH??????? NOT VERY FUCKEN MANY, I GUARANTEE IT!!<br /><br />Who can say they&#039;ve never had a shit batch from a good supplier, ever?? If u think u can ur probably a casual drug abuser, in a maybe you&#039;re in a bikie gang, possibly you know Walter White or Jesse Pinkman or more than likely, you are probably FULL OF SHIT!!!<br /><br />Has it really gotten to the point where we think that because someone is a vendor on SR that they are immune to having to deal with fuckheads IRL and they can wave a magic Narcotic Potency Wand ( side note: what a fucking brilliant idea for an invention ) over every batch of every drug and make it all fucking awesome?&nbsp; <br /><br />The times I&#039;ve gotten shit gear on the street, in a house, or anywhere else I&#039;ve ever scored in my lifetime, it&#039;s been - TOUGH FUCKEN SHIT, WHAT R U GONNA DO, TELL THE COPS THAT THE PERSON TO WHOM YOU JUST TRADED YOUR HARD EARNED MULA WITH IN EXCHANGE FOR ILLEGAL NARCOTICS RIPPED YOU?<br /><br />Go take ur lab tests to a street corner dealer - who will promptly tear them up, beat you, shoot you, fuck you in the ass, or all 3. <br /><br />At least AoD tried to make up for the fact he got sold bunk gear, which I&#039;m tipping&nbsp; NO CUNT GAVE HIM A RE SHIP OR REFUND ON, SO IT CAME OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET.&nbsp; During the time that all this has been going down, AoD has evidently been seeking a constant, quality supply of gear SO AS HE CAN GENUINELY LOOK AFTER HIS CUSTOMERS, WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY VALUES VERY HIGHLY.<br /><br />So here&#039;s a tip - 4sakn - Tell your &#039;mates&#039; who not long ago you feared were going to physically harm you to <br />1 -LEARN HOW TO USE A FUCKING COMPUTER, <br />2- TRY AND FIND A VENDOR TO SHIP TO YOUR COUNTRY, <br />3-TAKE THE RISK GETTING THE PACKAGE THROUGH CUSTOMS, <br />4 - HAVE IT SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED TO THEM<br />5 - PAY LESS FOR 1/2 AN OUNCE THAN MOST DEALERS CHARGE FOR A GRAM IN YOUR COUNTRY, <br />6 - TELL SAID VENDOR THEIR PRODUCT WAS TOO CUT FOR UR LIKING EVEN THOUGH YOU GOT IT&nbsp; FOR ABOUT A 10TH OF WHAT YOU WOULD USUALLY HAVE TO PAY, AND ACHIEVE ALL OF THIS WHILST:<br />7- GETTING A BLOKE WHO WOULD RE SHIP IT TO YOU IF ANYTHING WENT WRONG OR WASN&#039;T TOO UR LIKING.<br /><br />OR GROW A FUCKEN SACK, TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF AND FIND SOME REAL MATES THAT AREN&#039;T GOING TO THREATEN A &#039;MATE&#039; WITH VIOLENCE COS OF SOME GOD DAMNED METH!<br />( didn&#039;t mean to offend u if I did 4sakn, but people who threaten violence over drugs , or anything really, piss me off)&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138315.msg1347266#msg1347266">Quote from: GreenDragon on July 17, 2013, 12:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />TBH I dont know why anyone is still buying from AoD<br /><br />All his gear is cut to the max.. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Others who are surprised that people still buy from AoD, good, go get scammed by some other cockhead vendor like Infinite Source was, or get yellow tainted meth that looks like it was pissed on and tastes fucken horrid from europe. <br />Me, I trust a vendor who is honest and keeps his word to someone he only know&#039;s via pm&#039;s and who lives on the other side of the fucking World! <br />( By the way, I am not implying that all vendors are cockhead scammers, there are quite a few, but there are also some incredibly, awesome, talented people, highly skilled and passionate about their chosen craft )<br /><br />SO GOOD ON YOU AOD - I&#039;VE RE-NAMED YOU &quot;BIG NUTS&quot;, COS IT TAKES A REAL MAN ( OR WOMAN) WITH BIIIIIGGG FUCKEN NUTS TO ADMIT THEY MADE SOME ERRORS, AND EVEN FUCKEN BIGGER NUTS TO GENUINELY ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT UP TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT WAS AFFECTED BY IT.<br /><br />MAY THE NARCOTIC GODS ( and maybe Walter White)&nbsp; SHINE THEIR TWEAKED OUT, STONED, TRIPPIN, NODDIN &amp; OCD&#039;IN LIGHT UPON YOU, YOUR STAFF, AND YOUR WHOLE OPERATION! ;D&nbsp; UR ALL FUCKEN RIGHT BIG NUTS! 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />THIS :D<br />Love ya mate!

				Review of MDMA from AOD<br /><br />Packaging/speed:&nbsp; There is a lot of time and money taken into his packaging methods that is for sure, maybe a little overkill but you really can&#039;t expect any better.&nbsp; Great stealth and 2 day shipping to EC.<br /><br />Quality: The MDMA has no been user tested but tested black with marquis reagent.&nbsp; Has no smell and is in small clear/white rocks, which leads me to think this is a purer product than other MDMA with a heavy sass smell and oil.<br /><br />I also would like to note that AOD has been especially excellent as a seller when it came to everything I look for in a good seller, in both real life and on SR.&nbsp; He even threw in a generous sample of another product of his ;).&nbsp; If you considering ordering safe domestic MDMA at a good price, I would def reccomend AOD!

				I wouldn&#039;t waste my breath bro. Nikki is a fantastic assistant, courteous polite, and I believe really wants to look after the customer base.

This is a still new tight operation we are running so you must bare with us. AOD has only been on the road for 5-6 months now and we are almost in tip&#039;top shape. And you could be my sweet ass (very sweet ;) ) that in one or two more months we are going to be 5.0 ! (4.7 atm) <br /><br />TLDR; Here at AOD we love all of you, so try to send some love back and understand when a little error goes at hand.

				I just wanted to post here and say I love you, I love your products and I wish I could be a regular.<br /><br />4 weeks back, I was lucky enough to be the second-placed winner in your contest, even though I live in the Netherlands, and you&#039;re a US operation.&nbsp; I declined the meth as I&#039;m a weed and psychedelics fan and the MDMA, as mailing 1/8oz to Holland seemed like taking sand to the beach. You promised me a taster of your US bud varieties as a replacement, which was very kind.<br /><br />This week, I received a much better prize - a small bud of dense weed, and a jar containing some honey-coloured, smooth cannabis wax, with a lovely message assuring me I hadn&#039;t been forgotten.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since had a good chance to try both the weed and the wax. I&#039;m extremely happy.<br /><br />I vape most top Amsterdam varieties at home, but I&#039;ve found your (unidentified) bud to be better than anything I&#039;ve smoked in a month (since Starbud Sister in fact) - a full, behind the eyes stone, almost trippy.&nbsp; What is it?<br /><br />I have several concentrates and hashes to smoke currently including NaturalOils&#039; Superball and some top quality shatter, but your wax is the winner of this summer for me. A super-clear head high and a huge grin is my experience with tiny dabs of this.<br /><br />I just wish I had more of both. What combination of flattery, pleading and Bitcoins will persuade you to deliver here? Both the bud and the concentrate are better than I&#039;ve bought in Amsterdam this year.&nbsp; Thank you for both of these and also for the beautiful (and perfectly stealthy) packaging!

				This outfit is the shit I love these guys cause you get the gear quick and where i am from runnin outta dope is bad to me the speed of delivery out ranks strength of the dope as long as there is no alarming taste or colors ppl are happy to get some geek. I am curious what has drivin the price of your gear down have you got a better deal with your supplier? I love the prices im just in heaven cheap geek and it gets here fast i want a T-shirt and merchandise with that AOD logo on it if you could maybe some coffee mugs, edible panties anything would sell with that fuckin logo on it. That qp listing is a dream come true thats what i thnk the perfect amount is for a small town dealer theres alot of wiggle room you got plenty to get high with and even more to make money on 4ozs a week is the perfect sling and at that price shit is gonna be smooth.
