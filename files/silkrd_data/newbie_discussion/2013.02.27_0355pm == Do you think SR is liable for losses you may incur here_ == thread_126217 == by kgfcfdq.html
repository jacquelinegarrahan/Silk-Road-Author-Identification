				I seen a thread in the non-newbie section and kinda wanted to comment but can&#039;t, so I&#039;m starting a thread here about it instead.<br /><br />The title of the thread was: &quot;When will DPR stand up and become accountable for the missing thousands? &quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m of the opinion that DPR is not responsible for something like this. I&#039;m pretty sure this site and it&#039;s features are supplied &quot;as is&quot;, not with some guarantee that nothing will go wrong. I&#039;m not 100% sure what caused the loss of coins, from what I gather there was some dodgy code added to the site by the devs and this resulted in unknown entities being able to steal bitcoins? <br /><br />the details aren&#039;t all that important to my point, if it was all resolved already or if I have misunderstood something about the situation then just consider the following as a hypothetical about a situation where people put money into an SR account and something, outwith the control of the site operators, causes it to be lost.<br /><br />Is there any reason we should expect to be fully compensated if something like this happens? What we are doing here is highly illegal and experimental and is done at great risk by the people involved in it, granted there is profit for them too... but should one mistake by a developer, who are after all just humans like the rest of us, result in the site incurring massive losses to repay people who are sending their money to an illegal, covert, underground website? I don&#039;t think it should. I think we should all be here on the understanding that there are risks involved and anything could go wrong. We could put our money into our SR account one day and the site could be raided and taken down the next... what would people want to do then? Sue DPR in court lol?<br /><br />I understand it must be frustrating for people if they lost money, but if someone comes in and robs a bank you don&#039;t try to hold the architect of the bank accountable... especially if there has been no guarantee by the architect that the building is immune to being robbed.<br /><br />I&#039;m new here and have no idea how much was lost or what is being done about it, but I think if the money has been taken by an outside adversary, and isn&#039;t just lost in the system somehow, people should be very grateful for any help DPR and the SR team give them. If SR are refunding, then it is due to a &quot;we&#039;re all in this together&quot; mentality, not because they are morally responsible for the losses. Really we should all be here with the &quot;we&#039;re all in this together&quot; way of thinking, not with the viewpoint that if anything happens here the site is entirely responsible and must compensate you.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Nope. The risk are made clear to us. We take the risks, and if everything ends up pear shaped then we should have been aware of the risks before.

				Everything is at your own risk. Never put more money in your account than you would be willing to lose.
