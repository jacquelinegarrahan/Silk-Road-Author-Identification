				Hey everyone I&#039;m relatively new to SR and have only made 3 but 3 very successful purchases on SR with 3 top vendors karmapharma excellent MDMA, jimmynuechron awesome ketamine, and norcalking pimp ass LSD. I used BITINSTANT last time to transfer funds directly into my sr address with no problem. Well after saving up 300 dollars again I decided to try it again but noticed in my email I had a link to BITINSTANT so I clicked it and followed instructions like last time. But now two weeks later I have no money still!! I contacted BITINSTANT and said they had no record of me at all making a transaction. I don&#039;t know what to do I feel like I&#039;ve been duped and now I&#039;m out 300 bucks I mean I could care less about the money I just wanted to have some fun and expand my mind a little with some cool chemicals. If anyone has any advice or if any vendors or any good people looking for some good Khama and would like to donate a little please do to my address 15YxRpPuieURSroKZBbUXhJrxWHL5Hs7Sm or just message me under iphonehackr2013 thanks everyone

				Wow really? No not at all. This community is a tight knit one I&#039;ve came to learn helps others when shit like this happens. For anyone else that sees this post please forget the donation thing because that&#039;s the last thing I want ppl to think is I&#039;m trying to scam them. If anyone does have any advice that would still be appreciated much love and good Khama

				I recommend trying another way to get BTC for USD, there are plenty of options. You might want to not send in your whole amount at once if you are concerned it won&#039;t make it. Multiple deposits is more expensive but if something happens you&#039;re not out the entire amount.

				I don&#039;t understand people who sign up here just to beg for BTC and pretend like they&#039;ve been here helping people.&nbsp; You haven&#039;t.&nbsp; You signed up just to ask for money.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be surprised if/when people are doubtful - Bitinstant doesn&#039;t scam people, and if you are serious about missing coins after a transaction with them, then you would continue to pursue that rather than sign up here to beg for people&#039;s hard-earned BTC.&nbsp; Sorry to be harsh, but these ploys are all the same and I don&#039;t want to see any of our LEGITIMATE new members getting scammed just because they are empathetic to your story.
