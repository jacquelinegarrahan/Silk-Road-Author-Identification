				There is no PIN discussion place left to newbies like me...<br /><br />Here is the summary of this problem.<br />There is only one way to get your PIN reset without knowing the old one and that is to use your five (5) attempts to get a PIN message from support which cannot be opened for a time.<br /><br />First the waiting period was 7 days, after complaints of the members they made it 3 days; The problem is that it seems that time varies to people. I myself in wait 3 days and still cannot open the message in order to answer it to reset my PIN. I also am not alone in this situation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve a guess that maybe new accounts have to wait longer than the new 3 days period or something.<br /><br />Whatever, still the only way to get your PIN is to wait as long as it takes.<br /><br />Since it is a security issue, I also have a simple solution instead of disabling that option, to this problem for support: You could make the bitcoin deposit option in a way that requires to type your PIN. You may do that by requiring the member to type their PIN in order to see their wallet address, or you may just find a little different way to get this option since the wallet number could have been saved by old member so that may doesn&#039;t help them... So, even if you don&#039;t remember your pin, unless you wouldn&#039;t have to worry about your money and the currency changes anyhow.<br /><br />Also it would be nice to get an open explanation of this problems from the support. How long should we wait? Does time varies? It is just annoying.<br /><br />Regards

				Hi! I&#039;m going through the same process, now. I have waited three days (although I could read the message of pin reset for all three days) and replied this morning. How long did it take for SR support to get back to you? Is their pin reset an automated process, or does someone have to manually go through the messages to get to yours?<br /><br />I am just trying to eliminate any more delays. Thanks!

				i just dont understand how you could forget a pin. writing it down defeats the purpose for me. just make sure you check if you know your pin before trying to make an order.

				Sadly, I did write it down but wasn&#039;t looking hard enough when I went back to make the purchase. Yeah, I know.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />I have bitcoins attached to the account, so I can&#039;t make a new account. I tried to check it using the send bitcoins to another member and sending nothing and also the settings page, but both methods still contributed to the five times wrong.
