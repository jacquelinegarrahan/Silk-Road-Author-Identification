				Why do vendors only use USPS in the United States? Seems like FedEx and UPS would be a lot safer. Does anybody know?

				I think the general consensus is that the USPS handles quite a bit more volume, so the possibility of added scrutiny involved in delivering the packages is significantly lower.<br /><br />Basically they&#039;ve got a shit ton of mail and not enough time / man power to look all that closely at every / your package (assuming there aren&#039;t any issues with the package.)<br /><br />Issues being things like watched addresses, the name on the package not being a resident of the address it&#039;s being shipped to, bad / fake addresses, etc.

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but since UPS and FedEx aren&#039;t government entities, they&#039;re a lot less likely to care about what you&#039;re transporting as long as you don&#039;t make it blatantly obvious it&#039;s illegal.<br /><br />To add to that, I&#039;d be surprised if UPS and FedEx have drug dogs going through their mailing centers nearly as much as USPS.

				USPS needs to meet certain requirements before they can search a package. The terms of private shippers allows them to search any package for any reason.
