				At least six credible sources, including NASA, confirm that natural cloud formation almost always occurs at more than 70 percent humidity. Balloon radio observations indicate that chemtrail effluent is forming man-made clouds even under conditions of extremely low humidity.

				Contrails composed of water vapor will almost always dissipate in a couple of minutes, as they have for the last 50 years. Chemtrails not only prevail for hours, but foam out to create either a white haze or a dense cloud cover.

				Normal contrails begin to form a full wing span behind the tail section. Now we are seeing aircraft effluent coming right out of the tail (stabilizer section) or out of the wings, signifying that the effluent is being sprayed, rather than forming as a by-product of combustion.

				HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT SHIT COMING FROM A MOTHERFUCKING AIRBUS OR ANY CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT OR AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING CIVILIANS? FUCK NO<br /><br />We have had jet engines for 50 years but something has changed. We are seeing a whole new area of physics and aircraft activity as our skies are now continually overcast with either haze or clouds formed from aircraft effluent, a phenomenon which we did not see before early 1999.

				Yes. I seen much of the morgellon issue, scary stuff.&nbsp; Barium 130 is indeed radioactive; this network maybe connected to haarp systems too.&nbsp; When i Look up and see tic tac toe shapes in the sky, and huge anarchist A&#039;s, i&#039;m not too stupid to ignore that something more is going on. Thats a lot of money dedicated to spraying. Weather manipulation? are they painting aerosol chip boards in the earth&#039;s ionosphere with collodial metals?&nbsp; inquiring minds want to know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vaccines and fluoride is some nasty stuff too.&nbsp; Those who loose site of these realities will fall victim to agendas of depopulation.&nbsp;
