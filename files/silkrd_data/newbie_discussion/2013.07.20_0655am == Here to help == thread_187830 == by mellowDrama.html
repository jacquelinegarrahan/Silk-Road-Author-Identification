				Hi all, I&#039;d like to contribute back to the community so I&#039;m here to answer any questions you may have. I&#039;ve been on SR for a little shy of a year and seen and heard a lot of things. Some true and some not so true. I had a previous forum account but have been away for awhile so I forgot the password&nbsp; :o <br /><br />So anyways in an attempt to increase my post count and share some of the knowledge I&#039;ve acquired on my adventures I encourage anyone that has a question regarding SR, Security, Bitcoins, Best practices, Shipping or anything else related directly or indirectly to SR please don&#039;t be afraid to ask. I&#039;ll do my best to answer and if I can&#039;t I can guide you in the right direction.

				Just do what everyone else does, make a thread and just post 50 replies to yourself saying &#039;asdf&#039;, then go post this thread in one of the forums that isn&#039;t total garbage, where people will actually post in it, and appreciate what you have to say

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS : care to read this guide and give me your feedback?<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
