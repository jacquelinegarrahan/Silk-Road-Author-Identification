				You said &quot;How to ask for new products as newb....&quot;<br /><br />But then you just go ahead and ask....<br /><br />This is what I would do...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Stop being a newbie, then...<br />2.&nbsp; Post your request in the &quot;Item Requests&quot; forum board.<br /><br />Or (I heard this worked if your really smart)<br /><br />Go to doctor,<br />compain about needing class II drugs,<br />watch doctor, make sure he brings script pad into room your in, pray he leaves it there...then!<br />snatch it and run!!!!!<br /><br />If you get that far, good luck forging the scripts, that would be a baaaaaad idea, unless your really really smart!

				As a newbie I cant post onto the product request forum. and I know I have seen SII pads on the road before so I was just asking if someone could bring them back. Also most doctors now dont even carry pads with them into the room with them. I am not an Idiot and I would have tried that long ago. I am patient who is in constant pain due to the fact I have almost no labrem in my right shoulder due to an injury which hurts like hell. So for you to assume I am and Idiot just pisses me off. I Know there are forum rules and I want to follow them. and with you just being a jackass to me makes you sound like you are a dumbass as you make me out to be. <br /><br />Also did you know that SII scripts also require in some states special script pads as well. <br /><br />Don&#039;t assume you know everything because no one knows everything. thats why we ask questions. which is why I posted my original question.

				Nope, I definitely don&#039;t know everything.&nbsp; Hardly anything to be honest.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t trying to be rude friend, sometimes my sense of humor can offend people, it was unintentional if it had that effect, I apologize.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know much about script pads, but I&#039;m sorry about your pain.&nbsp; I did read an article about what happens when you forge a script though, and I know that its really hard to get away with, some people manage to pull it off a few times then get caught.&nbsp; One guy on the forum said his buddy went to jail for 1 1/2 years for forging a script, so I suggest you do not try forging a script.&nbsp; The end result of the discussion was just buy what you need from someone selling it, because forging scripts will get you in trouble unless you live in a computer illiterate country. <br /><br />Your not going to try and write you own prescription are you?

				I thought about it I live in a small town and I could probably pull it off because my pharmacy doesnt even call for sII scripts like they are suppose to. Lucky I know. so thats why I am asking I am also a really good forger. and My doc who writes most of my scripts prints them off most of the time any way making it even easier. <br /><br />

				Alrighty, but do your research, I dont want you getting in trouble.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;ve never been to a doctor so I don&#039;t know how things work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Forging still seems risky.&nbsp; But I did see something about duplicating a script, have you heard about that?&nbsp; Theres a service listed for this on sr.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve used it, or know anything about it, but seems safer to take a script u already got, then have it duplicated, then a complete forgery.&nbsp; Let me know how it goes.
