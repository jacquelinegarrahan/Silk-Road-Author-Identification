				Hey Guys,<br /><br />So I have a chronic pain issue and you may have seen a thread where I asked about taking cannabis for the first time ever. Well its been about a week/week and a half since then and yesterday I tried cannabis.<br /><br />I had 1/4th of cheeba chew hybrid and it made me super fuzzy, it completely numbed the pain - like I felt normal again and I even got some really good sleep - except for when I woke up and was no longer high. <br /><br />When I woke up the pain was excruciating - even worse than before I had used the marijuana. I ended up in the ER (luckily they didn&#039;t drug test me) and they treated my pain there with dialudid, fluids and some other things that work for me.<br /><br />So I guess, that is the first and last time I try marijuana for my pain. The side effects of feeling fuzzy/out of body/overly giggly and numbed combined with the return of extreme pain is not worth the relief I get for the few hours on the cannabis. <br /><br />Anyway, just thought I&#039;d share - it was definitely an experience I wont ever forget in both a good and bad way.<br /><br />

				Iamglover: I wouldn&#039;t give up on the weed so quickly.&nbsp; Your first high can be frightening and unpleasant, but once your mind and body gets over the shock of this brand-new drug in its system, it usually becomes a pleasant experience.&nbsp; I would give it a few more tries. <br /><br />Are you currently on any other pain relievers for your condition?&nbsp; If so, then I&#039;m guessing you may have forgotten or neglected to take your pain meds because you were high.&nbsp; Then you went to sleep.&nbsp; When you woke up, you were no longer high, AND you had no pain meds in your system.&nbsp; Hence the excruciating pain.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not on any other pain meds, then...well, I dunno.&nbsp; But I still would give it a few more tries before you give up.&nbsp; Lots of people have a bad experience the first time they smoke, and it turns them off of weed completely, which is a shame, because usually it becomes much more pleasurable once your body gets used to it.<br /><br />Incidentally, marijuana has NEVER worked as a pain reliever for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m always astonished by people who say it does.&nbsp; If anything, weed often makes my pain WORSE.&nbsp; It magnifies all of your senses, including your sense of pain (in my case, anyway).&nbsp; If I have a headache and I smoke, I end up with a worse headache.&nbsp; If I have an injury or surgery and I smoke, it won&#039;t make it hurt worse, per se, but I will end up focusing and obsessing over the trauma and the pain.<br /><br />For me, it helps relieve my stress and anxiety, and it also helps me eat.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any chronic illness or anything, but I do suffer from frequent loss of appetite and nausea.&nbsp; Sometimes I can&#039;t eat anything at all until I smoke.&nbsp; My stomach will be growling, I&#039;ll feel so hungry, but when I see the food on my plate, I just can&#039;t eat it.&nbsp; Then I smoke a little weed, and I can eat with gusto.<br /><br />

				I do suffer from frequent loss of appetite and nausea.<br /><br />I have had that same problem for the last year starving but cant face food, even lost 20+ kilos in as little as 4 months, been for scans cant find anything wrong, but this constant nausea is getting to me!.<br /><br />Smokeing for me make it alot worse but like you it enhances your senses alot.

				Also note: different strains can produce different effects, sativa is very mental, you&#039;ll be happy laughing, getting up and going, and with indicas, you&#039;ll be at rest melting into your couch like that old psa ad.

				Well, I used to drink.&nbsp; I mean, REALLY drink.&nbsp; At the worst point, I was drinking over a liter of hard liquor a day.&nbsp; After several detoxes and relapses, I finally managed to stop, but my stomach has never been the same since.&nbsp; I think I did some kind of permanent damage to it, because I never had problems with appetite and nausea before the alcoholism.<br /><br />Sadly, the one legal drug in the world is the one I cannot touch.

				I don&#039;t think Marijuana has ever been considered a Pain Reliever per se, as compared to Opiate medication for example.&nbsp; I think Marijuana makes you high so that you just don&#039;t CARE about the pain anymore.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same concept as Nitrous Oxide (laughing gas) at the dentist, it doesn&#039;t take away any pain, it just makes you not care about it anymore.<br /><br />If you thought that you could swap marijuana for legit-needed Oxy&#039;s, I can see why you&#039;d be sorely disappointed.&nbsp; You may consider using it however along WITH your pain medication.

				I&#039;d like to reverberate the talk of CBD by also recommending the strain Harlequin.&nbsp; Perhaps you can find a pheno of it that really helps.&nbsp; For a while, there was Northern Lights to lend a high CBD count(which NL is still awesome, by the way).&nbsp; But now I recommend a strain called Cannatonic.&nbsp; I&#039;m wanting to say that I&#039;ve heard of that strain producing up to a 14:1 ratio of CBD to THC.&nbsp; In case you are wondering, that is one of the extreme cases of the CBD count being MUCH higher than the THC count in a given plant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Moreover, you may find it to your benefit to try a concentrated form of your CBD heavy plant.&nbsp; Instead of having to combust a big pinch of plant matter to medicate, you could rub up a hot nail with a tiny amount of CBD oil and medicate in an even more clean and effective way compared to that of smoking (rather, combustion and inhaling the smoke of) the flower.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had some oil before that was touted as pure CBD oil.&nbsp; Although I have yet to seek out that product in a repeat fashion, I do imagine that it could be attained. <br /><br />And - somebody please correct me if I am wrong - but you may be able to ingest the raw plant and still get the good use of the CBD.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that to promote the possibility that you may be able to just eat raw plant matter (perhaps juiced?) and thereby not have to ingest smoke or use some kind of an MJ hash oil rig. <br /><br />Best of luck to you!

Maybe I could have taken some when the high was wearing off but - I wasn&#039;t aware enough to do so and the past is the past. So moving forward I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll be able to use marijuana as a replacement... Either that or I can maybe think about slowly moving from opiates to medical marijuana might not be a bad idea. <br /><br />I took my regular medication about an hour ago and since my roommate is out of the apartment for the night I ate a guessimate of 9mg of TCH. Much lower than the guesstimated 18mg I had last time I got high. I&#039;m starting to feel it in my head just like it did last time but maybe it&#039;ll be less intense/better now that I have taken the pain med? I&#039;m really curious to see.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179172.msg1301736#msg1301736">Quote from: b0m on July 03, 2013, 07:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would like to recommend the Weed Doctor from this forum that is this guy: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131780.0<br /><br />Tell him about your story in a PM.

				Don&#039;t worry about the &quot;high&quot; being too intense if you merge the two. Worst case, you&#039;re going to just pass the fuck out because you can&#039;t keep your eyes open. Don&#039;t stop taking your regular meds. As you mentioned, wait until the high wears off or you are about to go to bed before taking the opiate that way it&#039;s in your system while you sleep. If you wanted to wake up pain-free, the only way that&#039;s going to happen w/ the cannabis alone is waking up every two hours or so and taking another dose. <br /><br />Also I would encourage you to look at indica as well vs the hybrid or sativa if it&#039;s pain issues you&#039;re looking to address. <br />

				Hey! So, last night I had a better experience with being high - it really helped the pain and towards the end before I went to bed - I took my regular med. Which was good. When I woke up at 2am I wasn&#039;t in horrible pain like before but enough to take another pain med since it was due and I was aching. Went back to bed and woke up this morning really energized. Except now its later and I&#039;m just not feeling as energized. I&#039;m groggy and tired maybe because I woke up a lot earlier than usual today too.<br /><br />I ordered a CBD Cheeba Chew to try next so, we&#039;ll have to see how that helps!

				I like marijuana for pain myself. I hurt all over a lot and I refuse to take Oxycontin or any other opiate. They make me feel terrible and unable to sleep. I also have a lot of problems not being hungry when I am in pain so the MJ helps a lot there too. Like others said forgetting to take something like Oxy that you have been on long term is gonna cause a lot of pain since you have some level of a physical dependence on it. Perfectly normal in a person with chronic pain. If you want to replace the Oxy you are gonna have to taper off not cold turkey it. You can&#039;t replace an opiate with Cannabis like that. Sounds like you are on the right track. Good luck, and sorry to hear about your pain. I am in the same boat and it&#039;s hard for people that don&#039;t have serious chronic pain to know what you are really going through. <br />

I worry about addiction to drugs everyday, but it is important to realize that a physical dependency is so much different than an addiction. yah the pain is awful for me. I walk around in a 4-6 pain level and the oxy brings it down to a 2-3 and MJ makes it go away completely. Which is good, I&#039;m just still getting used to the effects of marijuana and maybe I&#039;ll work on tapering and making the switch to Cannabis. I want to see how the CBD Chew helps first.

				if you didnt take your pain meds with the weed then you started wd and that shit hurts. even if you take it the right way over time your body becomes addicted so when you dont take it dif levels of sickness depend on lenth of use and amount. if you took the pain meds just A LITTLE less so you dont get sick you will eventualy be off the pain meds. but right now im sorry to tell you that if you been taking oxy everyday when you stop you are going to be HURTIN!

				btw CBD cheeba chew from Pot Doctor my wife said it helped a lot, but it tastes like a cc with a lil nasty something mixed in. but hey it is medicine.(CBD not so good taste like THC) and start with only like 7 pieces of popcorn(recomendation)<br />also Bhang bars triple dosed cookies n cream and &quot;fire&quot; dark chocolate(fire has highest CBD)....hope all works out well for you !
