				As the headline says, my question is, who is best for pills in your opinion? I&#039;ve been doing a lot a lot of research and it seems like antonkoellisch got the best price/quality offer but unusual many comments say that the stealth was not so great so i was thinking about chiquita.. also since he offers a 50% reship and my order has to go to the USA.. one other quick question: if the customs take the package, will it always say something like that on the tracking webpage?<br />Thanks a lot <br />trapmusic

				What kind of pills first because most people don&#039;t ship with tracking some even make you sign.

				chiquita has been around a long time and both AK and Chiquita both require fe. im prolly gonna be ordering bulk mdma from chiquita but if AK is legit i would love to order some of his rolls. dont get why there are no reviews on the forums. basically if you have the money to risk i you could make more $ with AK as far as rolls go but i think chiquita would be a safer bet. hope that helps.
