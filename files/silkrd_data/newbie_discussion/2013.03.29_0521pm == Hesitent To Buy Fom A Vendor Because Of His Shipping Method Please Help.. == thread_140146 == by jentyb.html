				So i was gonna make a purchase of some weed and after reading the shipping info he listed he said he pretty much triple vac seals and &#039;&#039;Probably&#039;&#039; will bubble wrap it if he has it. Is this secure enough? After reading the shipping thread that doesn&#039;t really seem good enough... If this helps i&#039;ll never order more then a oz at a time but most likely 7g or so..

				The vendors usually do a great job and what they do. Triple sealed is pretty good, Bubble wrap? depends on box or envelope, may not be necessary. Talk to the vendor

				I agree with l33tn355. If reviews are all good, you&#039;re probably safe. Triple vac sealed is pretty solid IMO.

				As I do with all new vendors, put in a &quot;probationary&quot; order of the smallest possible amount and when it arrives determine if you are satisfied with the packaging and stealth.&nbsp; Then place a larger order.

				Oliveoil&#039;s advice might be right.... though you may smell nothing a dog could be overwhelmed by the smell.&nbsp; I have no experience with shipping or receiving bud but I would recommend reading a bit of this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0<br /><br />Be careful. ;)

				In my experience with a few cannabis vendors on&nbsp; here, the packaging is close to the same for all, with some minor differences. If they are a reputable vendor, or a shitty one that information will be very noticeable in their reviews. As others have said on here, try a small shipment first, make an educated judgement on whether you are comfortable with what you see....then proceed from there. Just remember that those minor differences I mentioned could very well be a big deal and keep you safer than you would be without them. If youre smart youll figure them out, but I wont mention them in detail here for security purposes. Good Luck
