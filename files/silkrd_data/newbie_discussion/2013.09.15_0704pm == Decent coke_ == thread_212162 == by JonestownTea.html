				You seem to pay through the nose for good coke these days... I&#039;d rather have some mephedrone for the price difference.

				Depends if you&#039;re prepared to pay, were you wanting 90+% or is your decent 50%+? <br />I would never pay the prices for the highest quality coke because I simply cannot afford it ;D<br />~D

				I&#039;m in the states and the quality I&#039;m looking for depends on the price.&nbsp; Like I said I almost never snort the stuff so I want something good enough to cook.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had coke that was advertised as 90%+ that actually was 90% though lol

Well worth having a look there first before you buy. Some vendors are putting the links to the results on their page, look out for them.
