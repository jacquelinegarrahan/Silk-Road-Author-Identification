				hey forums, i recently bought something legal off of the SR and had it shipped to me priority, it seems that the parcel got lost, (the ordered item is legal in all 50 states so the feds wouldnt have seized it) and i messaged the vendor saying i didnt get it after 8 days, he seems to have lost my receipt for my order but its still on my order page, he agreed to reship it to me due to my 0% refund/return rate so i PGP sent him where to send it? <br /><br />has anyone else experienced this? did i do something stupid by sending him my address which he would already have from my order?

				If the vendor is following the rules, he wouldn&#039;t have your address anymore after marking the first order in transit/sending the product. Vendors aren&#039;t supposed to save addresses. <br />That would be why he needs the address resent.

				thanks guys, this vendor has on his page 50% refund or reship if you can prove it wasnt delivered and if you used priority shipping (aka it will show up on his sent items stuff) and quite a lot of comments saying took forever to ship out here even with priority and some saying they never received it, this guy sells legal stuff to ship, so the feds wouldnt be intercepting his packages but i guess shit happens, bumping this
