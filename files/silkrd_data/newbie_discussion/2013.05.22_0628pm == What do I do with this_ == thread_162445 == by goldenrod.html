				I got some speed paste and I&#039;ve never taken speed before so I have some questions I&#039;d be grateful if&nbsp; someone could answer. <br /><br />How much do I take it and (since I don&#039;t have a scales) how do I gauge the dose?<br /><br />How do I take it...snort..swallow or what?<br /><br />What effects should I expect?<br /><br />As I said I&#039;d be much obliged if someone can give me some answers on these.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />

				Hey goldenrod,<br /><br />Do you know anything about the purity of the paste?<br /><br />Actually you take it like cocaine. You do a few lines and snort them. But please do not overdo it with snorting the whole gram at once. I am not sure aswell about how much you will need, since it depends on its purity.<br />Anyways, the effects should be like a very strong redbull if that gives you a relation to compare. You will be awake and very motivated to do stuff.<br />Stay safe!

				Thanks for your reply Barbequehax.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the purity.<br /><br />Does it make any difference in snorting it that it is paste and not powder?<br />

				Hmm, I would dry it, alone for the reason that I can not imagine snorting a paste. Anyways, if you can snort a paste or the pulver then, start slowly since you do not know the purity. Start with a small line and then if you don&#039;t feel anything after 20-30 mins, do another. Yet I would not recommend snorting everything in one night. I saw people snorting a whole gram in clubs but I didn&#039;t know the purity of these neither, maybe it was ultra low quality shit.<br />Good luck with your trip and stay safe.

				No problem. Maybe you could drop some feedback from the trip after you did it? I am quite curious now :)
