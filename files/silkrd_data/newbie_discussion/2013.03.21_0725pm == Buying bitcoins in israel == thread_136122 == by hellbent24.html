				Hi i would like to know if anybody can recommend a good bitcoin service i can use to buy bitcoins with nis(new israeli shekel) so far i&#039;ve been using bitcoil.co.il which is a really great service, but currently they&#039;re only selling to orders of 10000 to 20000 shekels which is ridiculous i don&#039;t have that kind of money. Any info on any other trustworthy sites or services would be much appreciated.

				I was in touch with the bitcoil guy recently, and the Israeli banks have limited his international transfers to MtGox, and so he has needed to limit the amount of new business he takes in.&nbsp; There&#039;s a new Silk Road seller ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/b36af5dd24 ) who I know personally who is starting to sell stuff to Israelis, and shipping from within Israel.&nbsp; He can transfer Shekels (NIS) into Bitcoins, and he wrote in a silver coin post ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/26760502a9 ) that he would make custom listing for those who wanted to exchange shekels into Bitcoin.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s a good way to work with smaller shekel amounts as there&#039;s an escrow service and a reputation basis in SR.&nbsp; The other good part is that those NIS-&gt;BTC transfers would be very anonymous, as apposed to bitcoil which needs your personal info.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let us know if it works out for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the Israeli community could use another source for bitcoins.
