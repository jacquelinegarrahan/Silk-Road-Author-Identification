				I am looking to trip via some SR LSD, but I am unsure about how it&#039;s measured.<br /><br />I have tripped before by taking &quot;hits&quot; (tiny squares of paper). But on SR, I see &quot;tabs&quot; being offered. Are tabs and hits the same thing? Or are tabs made up of a number of hits? I also see measurements of potency, such as 125ug. Does that measurement correspond to a single hit or the whole group of hits (which is what I assume a tab is)?<br /><br />Any information on this front would be helpful.

				Ah yeah, tabs and hits mean the same thing.&nbsp; I would just do some research first before trying.

				Its all ugs on here for LSD. tab/hits are interchangeable, you looking at that micro gram content to separate the weak from the strong.

				Yeah, every listing will refer to hits/tabs/blotters. This means 1 single square of blotter paper - not a sheet from which you can tear many individual hits from. Consequently, the ug refers to the dosage in each individual hit.<br /><br />For example, a listing detailing &quot;5 x 110ug tabs&quot; would get you 5 individual dosages. Obviously you don&#039;t have to take just one, it depends on your tolerance and experience, however the general idea is that one is a solid starting point.<br /><br />Hope that helps :)

				Thank you for the help. I was confusing &quot;tab&quot; with &quot;sheet.&quot;

				No worries, I had the same for a while. Was giddy with excitement thinking that I was going to get a 5 sheets of Lucy for about Â£30 haha. Luckily I did some reading round the forums and worked out what I was getting.<br /><br />Happy shopping dude!

				Hey Kosherbob, perhaps you have seen this before, if so, here it is again:&nbsp; The Avengers keep tabs on the SR LSD scene and do a bang up job of doing so.&nbsp; This saved me from getting ripped off and goes into some good detail on the vendors available and if what they are selling is legit:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />blahblah1234

				What had me confused was this description by MidnightBlue (located at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/358b4d4d36).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THIS LISTING IS FOR 1 &quot;FELIX THE CAT&quot; LSD TABS.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Apparently, it is a single hit/tab that costs ~$28. I thought that there would be multiple hits, but I guess I was mistaken.<br /><br />Thank you everyone for the replies :)<br />
