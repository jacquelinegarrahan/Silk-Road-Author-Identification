				Let me start by saying I think the 50 post limit is a waste of everyone&#039;s time.<br /><br />In other news, yesterday I funded for a product at a pretty high exchange price - $238 per BTC. I never would have bought coins at that price, but I wanted a specific product. Literally 5 minutes before the funds hit SR, the vendor sold the last one of the item I wanted. So my BTC are stuck sitting there with nothing to buy. Disappointing, but it happens.<br /><br />Then I wake up this morning, and great news! Bitcoins crashed and I lost half the value in my account. Nothing to order, and now half my cash is gone. I guess I belong stuck in the newbie forum - I sure got hosed last night!<br /><br />Beware the roller coaster that is currency volatility!

				They did not crash.<br />From my very limited understanding, someone sold 10,000 bitcoins and it caused a scare. Many people thought it was crashing and tried to sell. Bitcoins made it down to 90 dollars each but are back at 200. You probably lost some money but not to much. I believe it will crash soon though and many people will lose tons of money.

				hey man don&#039;t take it too hard. If you wait long enough, there will probably be a time when it comes back up, especially since the appreciation of value has gotten the attention of &quot;normals&quot; and non-techies. A lot of regular people want to own some and that only means that at some point the price will probably spike again. I&#039;d definitely hold off on selling since you bought it at such a high price.

				Sorry you caught the top of the bubble so far mate, but you have learned a valuable lesson about currency exchange. Plus you didn&#039;t exactly lose money, at least not yet, as you still have yet to exchange your coins. Bitcoins are more of a barter system instead of a hard or fiat currency, its only worth what people will exchange for it. The price could go back up, and in that case you could gain some value, but its probably not advisable to use BTCs as a store of value. But hey, you can stand with some large players in the FOREX market who have taken large losses over the years. Those guys do it for a living 12+ hours a day, and its impossible to predict the way the market moves. All you can do is try to get there before everyone else. <br /><br />I suggest you look at this graph to get an idea of where the BTC market is (likely) headed.<br />(clearnet warning) http://tinypic.com/r/119xi6q/6

				Well, personally after getting some useful advices from other members of the board, far more expert in trading....<br />......and they all adviced me to NOT sell.... the raising interest in BTC was real, yesterdays crack down was or 1. another DDOS attack, that caused an enourmous lag in trading, causing sellers to panic and mass sell. The hackers themselves + a lot of people that got the possibility, bought BTC low and they wait to sell high again. They would be the only logic explanation. 2. Mt.Gox official statement is that the yesterdays enormous lag (4400+ seconds) was because of the huge increase in the BTC volume of trading + an incredibly huge increase in the number of accounts opened yesterday.<br /><br />Personally, i find the DDOS attack more probable and i think Mt.Gox are just protecting their credibility and the reliability of their trading platform. I do not 100% believe them, but most of the people will and they will keep trading using Mt.Gox....<br />Mt.Gox is promising new servers adding to their system and, if it will be really done, its a clear sign of an increased interest in BTCs, so higher demand means prices going up.<br /><br />So, my advice is different; do not loose money, the people selling now are people who were lucky to get some BTCs at 20$ or so and, maybe a little scared from yesterdays events, are still happy to sell them at 160$ + in case of a DDOS attack, the hackers themselves. But, slowly the BTC will rise again, cause the increased interest in BTC is real, so my prediction is that it will slowly go back up again.<br /><br />I will not sell :)
