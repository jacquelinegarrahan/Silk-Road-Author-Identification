				On my way to 50, personally think the 50 rule is a good idea but would like to see more of a crackdown on these &quot;jump to 50&quot; threads, people should have to contribute to the community and prove their worth before they are able to wildly spread misinformation.

				while true. I think the spamming can be useful. I am not at 50 yet, ive spammed maybe 7-8 posts. I will do another 7-8 posts spam. It will make it a little easier to reach 50. I tend not to spam but last time i got frustrated with the rule i did. I often find myself posting on threads without much real content to help reach my goal. Im also bad at getting to the point. The rule is useful. I think if you could see what was spam vs what wasnt spam, a necessary postcount of 30 would be more reasonable. 30 useful posts would be just as effective.
