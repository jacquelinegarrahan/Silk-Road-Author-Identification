				Most vendors require FE for buyers with under 5 transactions. As I hate the idea of FE if I don&#039;t know the seller, what do people suggest is the cheapest/easiest way to get those 5 properly executed transactions?

				1. Find sellers that don&#039;t ask for FE even with new customers<br />2. Buy from a super reliable vendor, that you don&#039;t have problem FE<br /><br />I can name several vendors for 1 but not as many for 2. My first few transactions on SR were made up from those options

				You can buy a lottery or two but many vendors want to see some $ in transactions as well. Buy a shirt, a digital scale, a grinder ect all under $30 ea and it&#039;s a good way to get some traffic at the mailbox you are using.

				Only problem is that I have (lots) of shirts, a couple grinders, and a couple scales. Maybe I&#039;ll go for one of the knock-off designer watches or something. Or try for trusted SR vendors.

				Well, there are a variety of ebooks and lotteries that are only a couple dollars.<br /><br />But for someone making you fe because you are new, they can see that you only spent 10$ in those transactions, and know that it was not a &quot;real&quot; order.<br /><br />I would NEVER fe on SR, as a new buyer or for any other reason.&nbsp; TOOOOOOO many stories of people getting ripped off, even by reputable vendors.&nbsp; Its just too easy, especially now that many vendors are not tracking packages, and are not reshipping or refunding for orders that dont show.&nbsp; All they have to do is say they shipped it, and then threaten to put you on a black list if you do not still leave positive feedback.&nbsp; Also start with small orders, they are less likely to ask for fe if its only a gram or two.<br /><br />Keep looking for vendors who dont require fe.&nbsp; I have never been asked to fe, even after a bit of hooplah with one vendor.&nbsp; The one time I was going to volunteer to do so for free shipping, the rapport with the vendor went down hill, and I never did it.

				Do a few small 1-2 BTC transactions, be patient, and read seller reviews (on the forums).

				All vendor with more than 300 transaction and a 95% or more rate, are just 100% legit and will always talk if there&#039;s something wrong.<br /><br />Even if you FE.<br /><br />Make you you record all transactions information about your order.<br /><br /><br />Then you&#039;ll be able to resolv with SR staff once you are not asked anymore about FE. But it&#039;s really rare to actualy need this.<br /><br /><br />Buying loterry won&#039;t make the seller think he is a good legit buyer. No one is that stupid and selling stuff on the road ^^<br /><br />

				Vendors can see how much you&#039;ve spent.&nbsp; Don&#039;t waste your time on bullshit ebooks.&nbsp; Not all vendors require FE for new users buying drugs.&nbsp; Your options are better in a place like the states though.

				Still have never been asked by a vendor I researched to FE. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;ll ever trust a vendor enough to FE b/c that&#039;s how all the scams start. A reputable vendor turns or trades account. If I want more than advertised, I buy more.

				Lucky for me I&#039;m in the US. I&#039;ll definitely look around for vendors that don&#039;t require FE. Like someone said earlier, you never know when a vendor might turn scammer. I would have to imagine that most legit vendors don&#039;t have time to try and scam people for relatively small orders, but I could see a legit vendor trying to scam a newbie with no established ethos if the order was hundreds of dollars.

				Purchase five things you like?<br /><br />Seriously, don&#039;t buy low-cost things simply to get the transactions. That ain&#039;t cool.
