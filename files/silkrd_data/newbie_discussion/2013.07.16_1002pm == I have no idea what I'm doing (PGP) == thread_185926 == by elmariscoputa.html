				I&#039;m burnt out; today was the day I finally decided to join the silk road. However I&#039;ve tried running PGP and although I&#039;ve created a public key it says it&#039;s not useful for encrypting. I&#039;m really lost.

				PGP really isn&#039;t hard at all!<br /><br />Download GNU Privacy Assistant - Key Manager<br /><br />Select Keys-&gt;New Key.. and follow the screens to create your own key which consists of a public key and a private key.<br /><br />You give out your public key so people can encrypt messages that only you can decrypt with the private key associated with the public key used for encryption.<br /><br />Click on the key you just made and select Export to create a text file with your public key information. Give this out to people you want to receive encrypted messages from. Now people can encrypt messages just for you to view using your private key (and the password you created when you made the key).<br /><br />To view an encrypted message, select Clipboard and paste their message contents. Then select Decrypt and it will prompt you for the password.<br /><br />That&#039;s it!<br /><br />To encrypt a message, create a text file with the person&#039;s public key and save the file.<br /><br />Select Import and navigate to that text file. Now you have that person&#039;s public key in your Key Manager.<br /><br />Select Clipboard and enter the information you want encrypted. Then select Encrypt and select the person&#039;s public key you want to encrypt the message with.

				^^^^This. If you have a Mac, GPGTools works essentially the same way.

				Make sure that when you copy someone&#039;s pgp key that you select all the empty space and invisible carriage returns.&nbsp; In the PGP clipboard, Ctrl-A goes a long way in making sure you select everything to then copy.

				Hey Elmariscoputa - I&#039;ve posted the following on several topics over the past few days, and it&#039;s seemed to have help the people who were asking about pgp, so hopefully this helps...&nbsp; If you&#039;ve already installed GPG and created your own key, then you can skip the first few.... Also, you generally won&#039;t be encrypting messages with your own key, as you&#039;ll mainly be encrypting messages and your address for vendors, but you&#039;ll need to encrypt it with their key so they can decrypt it..... Anyway, hope this helps you with what your having problems with...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go to&nbsp; &lt;http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html&gt; and click the download button. <br />2.&nbsp; Once downloaded, open the &lt;gpg4win-2.1.1.exe&gt; file and click install. Also, during the install process, you will be asked what folder to save it to, as well as to select/check the boxes of what you want installed.&nbsp; Leave the boxes checked that are already checked by default, and also check the box next to &quot;GPA.&quot;&nbsp; I think you click a &quot;next&quot; button or something similar after that.<br />3. Once installed, it will ask you where you want shortcut icons placed. <br />4. If it doesn&#039;t open automatically after being installed, go ahead and open it.&nbsp; I cant remember if by default it automatically creates a key for you, so lets pretend like it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the button on the top menu bar that says &quot;Keys&quot;, the click &quot;New Key&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After selecting new key, it will prompt you for your name (you don&#039;t have to use your real name, most people use their SR names).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After typing your name, you will be asked for an email address, and then a password/passcode.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once finished entering your password, it will generate your new Key (I save it as a notepad file).&nbsp; Save this somewhere that you won&#039;t forget.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Once you have your new key, you are ready to encrypt/decrypt messages. <br />6.&nbsp; Click the button on the top menu bar that says &quot;Clipboard.&quot;&nbsp; This will open a new window.&nbsp; This is where you type and/or copy &amp; paste messages into that you want to encrypt. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once you&#039;ve typed in practice message and are ready to encrypt, you will click the button on the top Clipboard menu bar that says&nbsp; &quot;Encrypt.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once you click the Encrypt button, a window of keys will pop up (your key and all of the keys that you&#039;ve imported...... but at this point it will only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; show your key since you haven&#039;t imported any yet...... I&#039;ll get to that in a minute)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Choose the key that you would like to encrypt the message with.&nbsp; Since you haven&#039;t imported any other keys yet, select your own key for<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;practice.&nbsp; &nbsp;(However, once you do import other keys, remember that only the person who has the password to the key that you select will be able<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to &quot;Decrypt&quot; and read the message)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After this you will see that your message has now become encrypted....... <br /><br />I&#039;ll follow this post with how to import the other keys...<br /><br />To import keys from other people (usually you&#039;ll be getting vendors keys so you can encrypt your address with them).<br /><br />I&#039;ve listed my public key at the bottom of the following instructions for you to use for practice... (Also there is an entire discussion on PGPs that Scout started.... Which is also where I learned this)<br /><br />1. Copy the public key that you wish to import.&nbsp; (Make sure you begin copying at the beginning of the &quot;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot; and copy until the very end of &quot;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot;<br /><br />2. Once copied (Most vendors who use PGP have their key&#039;s listed on their profile pages), go back and click the &quot;Edit&quot; button on the top menu bar, then select &quot;Paste&quot; from the dropdown menu.&nbsp; Once you Click &quot;Paste&quot; the program automatically imports the key that you had copied.&nbsp; (Please note that you will not actually paste the key anywhere.&nbsp; You&#039;re just selecting paste from the &quot;edit&quot; menu)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Now you have just added a key to files, and you can now encrypt messages with it. (Again, please remember that only the person who the key belongs to and/or whoever has the password to that key will be able to decrypt the message)<br /><br />I hope this helps.....&nbsp; I know this shit can be a little nerve racking...<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.20 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFHhxqEBCACvCQph3SmivnAO6v9j0VPcY+tdsucE6vZsk3ThAE6yQeOgjyRy<br />A5N1NnxHVwMuUvEr/PhqYoG3xi9JZmPGQOckR/Bbhbg0MMaoJKzyWCJqFVPIeTMZ<br />0qxdWXDxM2baA4DetQonKdS8+4CyLyQFAyO3jidV+sAlLf2MHdknF+HCAlvet19X<br />/tL0r9zF0Uki9s+9L8sjR6/NP8h8NQ153zc3FZkCR4WOe6WIatIgwnjk5pRR3W/A<br />J41y1KMuB04cWpX1vKUL08PsvGpa99Uufonfq2lK+ZYsHImfGXRl4Za7uSf4Xwxu<br />WzEqLfM6lul7tWt4dIePHYLAMMKWBlychRx5ABEBAAG0IEphY2sgRG9lIDxqYWNr<br />RG9lMTNAdG9ybWFpbC5vcmc+iQE5BBMBAgAjBQJR4cahAhsDBwsJCAcDAgEGFQgC<br />CQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQcTqgoP5OJaPioAf/VqO+gZ1zpEN1WETp4ipiLflo<br />XCBQRLF9S4ooV9mRLlDFY62H63YxRYHrOpU9BCsuIuEO3PTHYp3Ydi156LS6pEkB<br />uCvmdU0N33XKjGiU3UUC4lSS+CVbzU6tKEFikpy8ZgOUKMEWmAKI0VwAsd9au3lY<br />aHqMSnjfBVrK3MHW11IufivHcKYW8VeRWwaoMSGtpqYnvaLeBTeXqgpJxLU1f8N4<br />SWwIorBVV6VMC6jxUU3DnqoMA7c2lhAOPuryHYZIgjjUc1akRWybU7QFUWhxLonE<br />9mr3zR+0rKnXGdO7I2nNMB8pcvL29foaN60/qrYOy4IIjnKa7W+Zra6+aAe5ubkB<br />DQRR4cahAQgA+G+3nMr19TAZBgne466sprYpNzU4DaPomjKtPNtzp4CaJ7uRdTEq<br />BjFA91ep1mmQlpOEGe+5vt5wg9IOIDDg8yF+gxn9vGND+Djih2MRTIhtyxPOG0+I<br />2f96XBNBkwresvdNIeUQHy3xFldaRUF+IJkx/VPkyJpO3Cowp5u6ndeXnICoYweE<br />vX0vbK49smGN4d0eJmo7umzh+CB8o2WD6RbVwXm1LJRm0CV+A9RpUavPdhl75LfR<br />I+IwKf/8lfckxf41DuV9AeVCdvGkCn9Y6gERabCFxvohTuc1hU9oPYa5NIxwP46d<br />50+durShzIh1y0Ku5AlrX0QrDSggqWSXdwARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJR4cahAhsM<br />AAoJEHE6oKD+TiWjraUH/14LPTLzNe8d3yLh74ANmv+4hE2870eIMWJGauu+a5Iv<br />c9OzRw3YaEdxq81nqugLOprvhnpi3ZiDVKpqppfDhS9unPRGp2nuYZr2SeU98CPc<br />oQyapT0IPCmO55upeQSadwbt+U2W/wurRsHS6PBBfk8DHbyVmls0iYvfZzg33Jkq<br />ePguvgrt9jxt1xVBsApUZ9MIMB5949LwXj7vRW3bI1eKz+CfkLbY5F6jPrp+1qu1<br />Zt32ilxUEPsg2VnZIig6frJq9ERDlRUY4dhIdjfAJjVLlCQizQH1YY7fSJs4g8+6<br />1OOCrZoaEwr4alzQuvBdln/wl95v+K6z1MmM61d7KsU=<br />=W7V1<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
