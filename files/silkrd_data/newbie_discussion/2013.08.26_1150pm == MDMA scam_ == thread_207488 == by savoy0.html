				I am very new to this online market (SR) i am used to dealing face to face with people. I had no idea this forum existed until SR went down yesterday and had a link to here. I was looking at Microbabes reviews and noticed that everyone was saying how good it was and this and that. I then saw posts from magenta and science saying they tested it and it had absolutely no traces of MDMA. It was to late though i have already ordered one gram of the product she is selling as Molly. I am very nervous because getting bitcoins was honestly the biggest pain in the ass. I ordered them on coinbase and verified my bank account and all the other shit it asked for and then found out it was going to take a full week for them to drop into my wallet. so me and my girlfriend found a guy that does it locally and we drove an hour north to meet him and spend instead of the 109 $ per bitcoin its supposed to be 138 per bitcoin just to get them instantly!! We ordered the MDMA on saturday and i pgp encrypted my adress and all my information and sent her 2 messages one on silk road and one here on the forum and have not heard anything back. Now not only and im worried that the mdma we are getting is going to be bunk but that we are in fact going to even get anything! Im not an idiot i just made a stupid move by not checking more into who i was buying from im not some dumb ass kid other wise i wouldnt be posting here. Im trying to get some advice on what i should do from here. If i should wait for her to respond or if i should message an admin or if i should cancel the order as soon as i can. If i do cancel does this refund my bitcoins 100% any help would be great !!!! And also if anyone has a recommendation of any SR vendors that have awesome MDMA crystals or powder would be great! Me and my girlfriend havent rolled in forever and we are dying to get our hands on some :) <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Savoy0

				be very careful when dealing with bitcoins locally, it is faster and a lot more convenient to do it through moneypak or mail, ect. but the risk of getting scammed is high. when your package arrives try it and then to see if it was legit, dont trust everyone on here bc some people just want to ruin business for others to gain more for their selves. good luck bro. have fun : )

				thanks for the advice brotha&nbsp; ...... i didnt want to do the bitcoins locally its just that buying bitcoins online for the first time results in all that verification bullshiet that takes like a week to get them. and you know how it is when your staring at a pile of drugs on the screen hahaha you want that shit nowwww!!!!

				Haven&#039;t tried, but it isn&#039;t MDMA. The listing on Microbabe&#039;s page that was &quot;1 G MDMA&quot; or whatever is now &quot;Snow White Ecstasy&quot; aka Methylone.

				Streets/Online it&#039;s always a risk that unfortunately we all take. What comes around goes around though so it will come back in your favour :)
