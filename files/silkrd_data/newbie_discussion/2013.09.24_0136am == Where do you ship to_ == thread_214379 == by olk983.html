				Not your own residence unless youre stupid.<br />Or a friend who will rat you out if he gets pinched.<br />Need to show ID if you rent a box.<br />A vacant house would be best.<br /><br />Any other ideas?

				I recently conducted a poll and 75% ship to their own address. Vacant houses, neighbors house etc all pose a risk of you not getting your stuff. Anyone can send anyone anything.

				Wrong... Vacant house would be worst.<br /><br />You really think the mailman doesn&#039;t know that they house is vacant?&nbsp; Hell, it&#039;s a crap shoot just using a false name to a real address... some mm won&#039;t deliver it, and/or flag it.<br /><br />Then let&#039;s say the delivery is flagged since this is one of the biggest anomalies they look for... a postal inspector tells the mailman to deliver it, yet sets up surveillance.&nbsp; When you get arrested after you pick up the package, you have no plausible deniablity.&nbsp; (you knew you were being sent that package of drugs)

				Get a job as a mailman, then order to any address on your route and pocket them while delivering :)

				I think you are nuts shipping to your home address, if your vendor gets busted he will happily hand over his client list to save his ass.<br />Instead, pay a bum to rent a mailbox for you... are there any sites where you can hire them for jobs, like standing in line for new iphone?

				Dude the best way to actually get your shit is to have it sent to your address.&nbsp; Its up to you if you want to waste a bunch of money and experiment getting it shipped elsewhere but the only sure way of getting your stuff is to get it sent to your address.&nbsp; Every form of trickery has been thought of before and using your real name and addy is the most reliable.&nbsp; Do what you want but most people just get it shipped to their place.

				No respectable vendor keeps any kind of customers lists. Not only would it be horrible customer service, it would be discriminating evidence against them to have a list of customers and what they bought. <br /><br />The level of paranoia should depend heavily on the risk involved. If you&#039;re ordering small amounts for personal use it doesn&#039;t really matter that much. Get caught, lose drugs and pay a small fine, at least that&#039;s how it works here. But if you&#039;re growing at home or have something else stashed up there then order to a friend&#039;s place who has a clean house. Only with bigger amounts is it worth it to get creative.
