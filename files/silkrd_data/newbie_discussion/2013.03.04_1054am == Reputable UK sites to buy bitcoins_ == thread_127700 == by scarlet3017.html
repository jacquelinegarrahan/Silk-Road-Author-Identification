				Hi there,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR, just spent the last hour or so reading all I can about how it works. I&#039;m sorry if this has been covered elsewhere, but does anyone know of any trusted UK bitcoin sellers? Or maybe you can direct me to a thread that&#039;s already been started on this? I&#039;d really like to try a small transaction, just to get my head around how it all works, but there&#039;s so much discussion about scammers, I&#039;m feeling a little overwhelmed.<br /><br />Thanks

Firstly if you create a wallet on blockchain.info that will hold your coins safe and securely as I only recommend send over the exact amount you are willing to spend on what ever item you have chosen, maybe one or two extra just in case the rate changes as I will say it usually takes an hour or two for the coins to appear in your SR wallet unlike blockchain which is instant. On block chain you can purchase up to Â£100 of coins in a single transaction at the MTGOX it&#039;s simple as you select the bank transfer option and type you a/c number, sort code and bam done. I use more times than none bitbargain.co.uk you may pay up to 1GBP extra per coin but it&#039;s useful if purchasing large amounts of coins which I usually do because the recently the rate has increased dramatically so you can make some serious saving if you buy a load and then keep in you blockchain wallet until your ready to spend. Another good site is localbitcoins.com they work a similar way but also if you type your postcode in it allows you to see people in or near your area where you can do cash for coins, meet in a local and public area and it&#039;s quick and easy and sometime the rates beat MTGOX. I would recommend a seller of coins and his username is Netizen, I will leave a link to his localbitcoin ad at the bottom and he is also on bitbargain. His current rate for bank transfer is 24.77 GBP / BTC but if your near London he does local meets at a lower price <br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/Netizen/<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/2712/purchase-bitcoin-bank-transfer-deposit-united-kingdom <br /><br />Hope that helps somewhat.<br /><br />All the best with you SR adventure.<br /><br />MM

				Thanks for the info MM. <br /><br />I am still researching around bitcoins but it&#039;s good to have a recommendation. Not so keen on the idea of meeting someone in a park, though - the whole appeal of SR for me is avoiding the need for those shady public dealings! <br /><br />I&#039;ve now found the wiki page that lists bitcoin sellers, so for any other clueless newbies like me, here it is: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming the ones listed on here are reputable, at least for the time being? At the moment, I&#039;m more concerned about security and scammers than I am about getting the best exchange rate. Once I find my feet, maybe I&#039;ll be looking into how to get the best rate.<br /><br />Any other advice still gratefully received.<br /><br />Thanks

The whole meeting in a park isn&#039;t exactly how is works and it&#039;s not some shady deal lol buying coins isn&#039;t illegal it&#039;s like buying foreign currency and you&#039;d most like meet in a cafe or something but that aside if it&#039;s an issue then just do online transactions. Bitbargain is great and there is a tutorial video on exactly how to use it plus it only accept reputable sellers so no scams. I met Netizen through these sites and now I just text him he&#039;ll send me his bank details I&#039;ll make payment, text him my blockchain bitcoin address and he sends the coins, his number is on his advertisement on localbitcoins but you can still use the eskrow technique on either localbitcoins or bitbargain if you perefer to build trust first but I would recommend Netizen any day. I&#039;m glad I found both sites and him as I can get coins in an instant and after a few purchases it becomes second nature.
