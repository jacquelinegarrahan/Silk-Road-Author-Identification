				I know there are some posts about this information and I have read through a bunch of them, but I would like to just get a little more feedback if I may.<br /><br />So I ordered a package a week ago and waited for it to show up.&nbsp; After almost a week of the package not showing up I contacted the vendor and asked what was going on. He said that he had a little bit of a delay in the shipping due to some problems which was understandable. So another week went by and still no package. I contacted him again and finally just asked for a 50% refund which he gladly did. <br /><br />Now before I ask my question I just want to state that I am not worried or paranoid of anyone coming to my house because I have nothing to hide. I&#039;m simply asking out of curiosity to gain some knowledge.<br /><br />So I didn&#039;t get tracking or anything just plan shipping so know way of knowing really what happen to my package. But I am just wondering that when a package&nbsp; never shows up what are the possible reasons that could of prevented my package from arriving? Other than the obvious typo&#039;s by me or the vendor which im sure I had no typo&#039;s. Not sure on the vendors side. Anyways could it got lost? Seized by the post office or what? Just strange that no package has arrived and I have zero information from the vendor or anyone of what happened.&nbsp; The drug I ordered is highly unlikely to get seized (No bigger than a few baseball cards) so im just thinking more that I either got scammed by the vendor or he messed up. Just would like to know all the scenarios that could of happened when a package does not arrive. Does USPS have a history of losing mail? It was a domestic buy btw.<br /><br /><br /><br />Note: He&nbsp; requested that I did FE early because of my new record. Forgot to add that within the first week of no show up he did give me a 10% refund for the delayed shipping.
