				I joined up 4 days ago. Have a big weekend coming up so want a small amount of a few different items. <br />Two orders look to be successfully going through or at least they&#039;re processing.<br />My questions are as follows: -<br /><br />If you have the bitcoins, place an order, the vendor cancels the order within hours or instantly (he&#039;s not interested cos you&#039;re a newbie) why are you still charged .9 - .14 BTC just for placing an order????<br />Theres been no transaction as such, just a request for an order. Why on earth does a vendor or SR keep money when it doesnt go further than just a request for an order??<br /><br />I understand some vendors require certain criteria otherwise you have to FE....which I&#039;d be more than happy to do when the order is accepted (especially for reputable vendors) but when you place the order the FE option doesn&#039;t even show up so again the vendor cancels and again you are charged BTC. Am I doing something wrong? Just a bit brain dead?<br /><br />My account now shows 3 refunds in 4 days of being a member yet I have not received an item, not asked for a refund, just had my orders rejected.<br />Surely other vendors will now see my history as being shit therefore wont want to buy from me. Catch-22.<br />I havent whinged about goods not received, raised any dispute&nbsp; or requested refunds yet my account stats dont show that specifically .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ie it wont say &quot;order rejected&quot;...it just says &quot;refund&quot;.<br /><br />How on earth does a newbie successfully buy a few different items (all small quantities really) over a week when all the vendors dont give you a shot? <br />How can you make sure you keep your account history good?<br />Im financial...Im ordering ( or trying to) but man this is frustrating!!<br />&nbsp;:&#039;( ::)<br />

				Is it SR commision? They have to make money somewhere in all this.<br /><br />My advice:<br /><br />Shop around for new vendors who don&#039;t require you to FE if you are &lt;5 sales or &lt;$100<br /><br />Withdraw your btc, start a new account then do above.<br /><br />Contact a mod or click the support button on your account page.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bummer, I&#039;ve made my first 2 sales today and was nervous I may be rejected, but there are ok sellers out there.<br /><br />Good Luck.

				Maybe you should start a new account and then message the vendors before placing the order and explain the situation.&nbsp; I would also only use very reputable vendors.&nbsp;

				Hi, the vendor didn&#039;t keep any of your money.<br /><br />The product you attempted to purchase was hedged. That means your purchase is pegged to the US dollar the moment you finish in the shopping cart. In the event of a refund, those escrowed dollars are converted back to bitcoins at whatever the current weighted average is for bitcoins, minus the SR hedging fees.<br /><br />That is why some of your bitcoins were missing. On an unhedged order, this isn&#039;t an issue at all.

				Thanks for the advice. <br /><br />nanpa Thanks for clearing&nbsp; that. I thought hedging was purely once the order is placed not even before its gone through. <br /><br />Man Ive now lost .3 of a bitcoin just trying to order..<br />Theres still no way of making my account history look any better.<br />All these refunds in 4 days is probably a put off for vendors and yet I just want to BUY.<br /><br />Ill have to start again I suppose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a bummer cos some have 5 day delays in posting.<br />Also I really only want to order domestically since international stealth is more of a worry.<br />Thanks for your help.

They act like they care about SR and the community but really they are just out for themselves. They know what they are doing and what it will do to you when they cancel your order. Better you then them though. Look at all the complaints. I had a vendor do the same thing to me but tell me after canceling to make my order from one of their other listed ads. What was the difference in the 2 ads? In the time it took them to cancel my order and refund my BTC the value dropped HUGE so now I didnt have enough for what i had already purchased. There was no reason for it.

				I&#039;d also remind you that you are dealing with a system that allows you to have drugs delivered to your doorstep. Thus:<br /><br />1) you can loose money and get ripped off. In fact I&#039;m sure it will happen to everyone on the road<br />2) you shouldn&#039;t be on here if .3 is too much money to loose. That translates to about 20 USD.<br /><br />That being said, as a newbie, I just issued some orders they all came through.<br /><br />This was my process:<br />1) looked for new vendors that had low or no feedback. I did this intentionally because I new that they would be less likely to reject me for being too new.<br />2) searched forums just to make sure there were no threads warning against buying from them.<br />3) ordered, and then immediately messaged the vendor introducing myself and telling them that I was new and if it wasn&#039;t cool, to just cancel the order - but that I would be prompt with reviews and be sure to leave good feedback if it all worked out<br /><br />each vendor was extremely responsive and courteous, and my orders came through quickly without a hitch.<br /><br />But notice that I intentionally went with vendors who were more likely to rip me off, I think this was a good plan because even if they did, I do the community a service by taking a bullet and reporting misbehaving vendors, and if it works out I get drugs and buy history.

So do I do the same thing again and message another vendor? Let the BTC drop a little more? $200 worth turned into $79 dollars because I wanted to be polite. Just saying what happened to me is all. <br />If you want to take a bullet for SR there are TONS of scammers out there that would love to help you. SR wont show you a bit of respect or care that you did it. No one will notice your good works as a whole. It will just be a negative feedback here and there that you leave. It doesnt stop the scammers.&nbsp; <br />So dont take a bullet for anyone. I go with people I think wont scam me. If im the least bit apprehensive about anything I dont buy but thats just me&nbsp; :)
