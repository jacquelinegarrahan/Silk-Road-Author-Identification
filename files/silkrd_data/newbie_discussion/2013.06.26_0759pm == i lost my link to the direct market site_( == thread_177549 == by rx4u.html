				In my head. :) If you can remember the marketplace URL -- which is rather easy to remember -- you can find the links to the forums and the wiki from there.<br /><br />The URL is: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />And this is how I remember it (by breaking it down into parts):<br />SilkRoad + VB5 (Visual Basic 5 for me) + piz3r (pizza) = drugs ;)<br /><br />Make up your own rules for remembering it, that way you&#039;ll never forget it.<br /><br />EDIT: It&#039;s extra easy if your rules are something you can visualize in your head, see those items together and you&#039;ll magically know the URL. :)

				other than the memorizing tactic ( which i can only do with numbers ) are there any sites/services on the tor network you can store important urls, info,&nbsp; &nbsp;bookmarks, and even encrypt them?

You can PGP it if you&#039;re going to put sensitive information up there, you just have to store your private key in some safe place and password protect it (I would use a USB stick for this purpose). Optionally you can just get a USB stick, put your stuff on there and encrypt the disk itself.

				the exact link that everyone always gives out, is the exact link on wikipedia&#039;s &quot;Silk Road (Marketplace)&quot; Page... I usually (while on tor) just go to wiki and click that link *shrug*... haven&#039;t had a problem yet
