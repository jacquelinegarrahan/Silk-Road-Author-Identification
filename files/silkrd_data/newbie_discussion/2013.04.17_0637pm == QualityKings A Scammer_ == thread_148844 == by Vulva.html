				After 10 days you get the option to resolve, right? If the vendor can&#039;t provide shipping confirmation we get our coins back, right? <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had to resolve an order in my 11 months and hope I don&#039;t have to with my order with QK. It was market in transit on the 14th, so should have been sent out on the 15th. I&#039;ll only be worried if I don&#039;t receive it by the 18th.<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				Well, no response from QKings yet, so I&#039;m going to put up a note on the Rumors board sumarizing our discussions here. I have an open order, but can&#039;t recall if it was hedged or not. QK marked my order &quot;in transit&quot; the day after I placed it, and I think that info disappears. The fact that he&#039;s marking his orders in transit but not shipping them is what pisses me off - I can sympathize with vendors tryign to do business in the middle of the BTC craziness last week, but I can&#039;t forgive that.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m really on the fence here. He did state that his packages would be going out late. He&#039;s still getting good feedback on his vendor page (3-4 just in the past hour.)

				[Vulva - assuming that you do get your package, can I suggest that you go back and edit the title of your thread to indicate that QK is not a scammer? You can just go to the first post and click on the &#039;Modify&#039; button on the upper right]<br /><br />OK, my order showed up today! Mine was marked in transit on the 11th - one day after yours, Vulva, but shipped on the 17th. I&#039;m guessing now that you&#039;ll get yours.&nbsp; <br /><br />I appreciate the problems that QK may have had with the BTC bubble, 420, etc., but all of this commotion could have been avoided with just a little bit better communication (e.g. another update the vendor page if they couldn&#039;t handle individual messages).<br /><br />In fairness to QK, I suggest that the various people who have indicated that they&#039;re waiting for orders update on whichever threads they&#039;ve post on if and when your order comes in. It isn&#039;t and never was my intention to make unfair accusations against QK, and if everyone gets their stuff, then I think we have to write this off as a unique occurrence due to a bitcoin freak-out.<br /><br />Anyway, I will give them 5/5 feedback because I did get my package, along with a little extra treat).

				Placed my order around the 9th, just received it today. I was hoping to have it for 4/20, but I&#039;ll at least have something for an upcoming trip now. Packing was beyond what i was expecting and i can tell they put alot of consideration in their work. Would i buy again, well i haven&#039;t tried the product out yet, but once i have, I will report back. But i have added him to my list of acceptable sellers for now.

				I think &quot;sketchy&quot; is a little unfair - if he&#039;d asked people to FE before he shipped, I&#039;d agree - that&#039;s sketchy.&nbsp; There are a handful of FE&#039;s over the last few days, so I&#039;m wondering what&#039;s up with that.<br /><br />Maybe the main guy took a week off &amp; left someone else to drop off the mail&nbsp; Looking through the reviews, he seems to have these drop-out periods.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, it&#039;s unfair to the customers to put something in transit before it&#039;s actually in transit.

				Nothing again today.&nbsp; I see now that he hasn&#039;t been online in a week and all of his listings are down....&nbsp; Looks like people are still getting their orders in though, judging by his reviews.&nbsp; I&#039;ll wait a bit longer on this one.

				Received my order today.&nbsp; I wish he wouldn&#039;t have marked it in transit until it was actually in transit.<br /><br />Product is great.

				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />We apologize for any issues in the past, We became a victim of our own success and simply could not keep up with orders without jeopardizing quality and our stealth shipping methods. We took our listings down and restructured our business to make sure this sort of thing does not ever happen again. We understand this sort of thing is not acceptable and we are truly sorry for any troubles we have caused you in the past. We assure you that we are not scammers, We are pretty certain that most everyone got refunded thru the resolution center. We now have the capability to handle a volume that is far beyond anyone&#039;s imagination. We are shipping almost all of our packages out same day as of right now and plan on keeping it this way. We have also added some new products on our listings page. If you had any issues with us in the past please send us a message and let us know what we can do to earn your business again. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />-qk
