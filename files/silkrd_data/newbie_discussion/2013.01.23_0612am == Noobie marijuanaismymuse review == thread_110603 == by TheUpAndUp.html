				I made an order of some benzos. I had less than 5 transactions and was not required to FE, probably because i used tracked shipping. The package came in a reasonable time considering he is busy, stealth was decent and product is good. <br /><br />I did FE for him in hopes that I&#039;d get my package sooner and he didn&#039;t rip me off, just wanted to throw that out there. I probably won&#039;t FE for anyone anymore though. Just to be safe.

				This is still the drug game, don&#039;t FE just to be nice, be nice by ordering from him on a consistent basis and by releasing funds on time and writing good feedback if he provides it.<br /><br />THINK!

				You should be able to tell if you&#039;re dealing with someone on the up and up by reading feedback. That vendor seems to have a ton of happy customers who have FE&#039;d.

				MarijuanaIsMyMuse is one of the best vendors I&#039;ve had the chance to buy from. <br />I ordered 0.5 grams of MDMA&nbsp; <br /><br />Odering: Quick responses and SUPER fast shipping even from CA to USA. <br /><br />Arrival: Package was mundane looking and product was sealed and very secure. It was all there, even slightly overweight.<br /><br />Actual Product testing:Great pure feeling. I dosed .01 and I was feeling great. Very pure high. It was one of the best experiences. <br /><br />Overall 5/5 Starts<br />Would DEFINITELY order form this vendor again.
