				Used to LOVE Pantera, Opeth, Therion, In Flames, etc.<br /><br />Still do, but nowadays mostly listen to electronic music of various sorts though, heh. Metal just doesn&#039;t sound as &quot;enhanced&quot; with drugs. :)

				Some metal is good. I&#039;m pretty eclectic in my musical tastes, I listen to everything from classical to death metal to edm. It&#039;s highly dependent on the song moreso even than the people singing/playing it. I like a lot of old school metal bands like Black Sabbath, Megadeath, Pantera, and (old) Metallica. I don&#039;t get to hear a lot of new metal anymore.

				Weed is, for me, the best music enhancer. I didn&#039;t listen to electronic music until I started smoking pot. Now, ~10 or so years later, electronic music of some sort (and I don&#039;t necessarily mean modern EDM like Swedish House Mafia, which I actually find pretty awful) is probably close to 90% of my music collection.<br /><br />My friends and I, for the past ~4 years, have gathered to share music with one another on a regular basis. Everyone brings a set of 3-6 songs and we all get super blazed and listen to music on quality hi-fi equipment with some sort of interesting visualization on. It&#039;s a great experience and we&#039;ve all been able to get into some stuff we normally would never have come across.<br /><br />Shrooms and MDMA are awesome too, though for different reasons. Some of my favorite music is the sort that is reminiscent of the afterglow of a mushroom trip. Heh, I wish there was a name for that genre. (Ulrich Schnauss, Emancipator, Joey Fehrenbach are a couple of artists that come to mind)<br /><br />Yesterday my fiancee and I rolled face and discovered some great music. Check out Efdemin&#039;s self-titled album (awesome dark techno) if you&#039;re feeling adventurous and willing to go off of a complete stranger&#039;s recommendation.

				what kind of metal are we talkin BRA?????&nbsp; <br /><br />i love grief, weedeater, burzum, sleep, electric wizard, doom, agoraphobic nosebleed, nuclear death (!!!), unholy grave, acid mothers temple, cult ritual, mick barr, man the list goes on forever, i have tattoos..&nbsp; i used to be really really into it, and played in a couple of raw black metal bands and made some stoner shit at one point, went on tour w/ some crust punk bands and a pitbull..&nbsp; thats all<br /><br />now i DJ dubstep/jungle/dancehall a couple times a month (always old school &amp; dark) and produce music/write for local rappers, mostly on the shawty redd/lexx luger/zaytoven side of stuff, minimal, heavy on the hooks, rude horns, i work with a lot of young guys (teens) and really like to hear lyrical content in the tradition of triple 6, z-ro, ugk, etc. but from their standpoint.&nbsp; many of them are just awesome artists imo, and i enjoy working with them much more than the metalheads for the most part (tbh i think i just have a bit of a problem getting along with white people IRL).<br /><br />if i&#039;m choosing music to listen to, though, by myself, it&#039;s always quiet storm kind of rnb shit, new edition, sade, keith sweat, maxwell, r kelly, trey songz.. im a sucker for a nice reverby rimshot...
