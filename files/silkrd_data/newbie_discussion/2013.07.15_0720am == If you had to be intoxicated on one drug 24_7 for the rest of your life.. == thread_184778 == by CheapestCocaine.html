				not too experienced with drugs. alcohol, weed, vicodin, molly. i think that&#039;s it really. i&#039;d choose molly - everything just feels so good. only downsides are can&#039;t sleep, food tastes like shit except for some cold fruit (grapes were great), can&#039;t read shit cuz of eye wiggles lol and i&#039;m not sure if i could live a normal day while rolling. but i probably couldn&#039;t say the same for alcohol or weed as well. alcohol while fun, just makes me too tired. weed too actually but also very very hungry and i hate being too high - time feels slow as.<br /><br />interesting question. honestly, if sobriety was a choice, i&#039;d definitely choose it haha. you can do anything sober!

				I bet most people who would choose one would pick weed. I dont get how people do it. I have friends who wake up and hit a dab then go about their day. Weed makes me paranoid as fuck! alcohol does the opposite, i would be so down to just be drunk all the time haha

				My first thought was: MDMA, no fucking question about it.<br /><br />Then I thought, not being able to piss, hard to get it up, gotta keep your body temperature down, exercising makes your heart explode.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s not a realistic thread, so if only the positive side-effects, then MDMA, no questions!

				That&#039;s a good point... cannabis 24/7 could probably hinder productivity.<br />I guess I wasn&#039;t realistically thinking 24/7. Uh, how about a weekly cycle.<br /><br />That way, I get to have fun on a daily basis, enjoy the wide assortment of treats available.<br />Very difficult to just pick 1. I think I gravitate more towards downers and hallucinogens.<br /><br />Uppers aren&#039;t really my thing. Sometimes I take prescription stimulants then fall asleep.&nbsp; &gt;:(
