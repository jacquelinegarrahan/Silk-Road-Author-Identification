				Greetings SR&#039;ers,<br /><br />I need help deciding on a US MDMA vendor. Priorities are:<br />1.) stealth - I&#039;ll be sending to a hotel<br />2.) product quality &gt;80% MDMA with great reviews<br />3.) reliability/professionalism<br /><br />My quantity isn&#039;t huge, around 1.5g or 10 pills/capsules.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ve narrowed it down to:<br /><br />&quot;SuperTrips Green Question ? Marks&quot; from usa2usadutchxtc<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />&quot;US ONLY* 140mg PURE (84%) MDMA Capsules&quot; from Aidoneus<br /><br /><br />Thoughts? I&#039;m also open to another vendor suggestion.<br /><br />Thanks in advance :)

				I recently ordered a 10 pack of Aidoneus 140mg pills. They shipped very fast and professionally/discreetly, and the roll is very, very clean. One pill was enough for a strong roll for me and each of my friends, conveniently packaged no more eyeballing tiny piles of powders. We took the pills in the early afternoon and all of us were well ready to sleep by bedtime.<br /><br />Less recently, I made three very satisfactory transactions with UnderGroundSyndicate (UGS), also with very good product quality and shipping.

Buying molly locally has been such a stressful thing for me no matter where in the country I have lived. Half the time it&#039;s not even MDMA, the other half of cases you know it&#039;s cut with something anyhow because you have to take so much to roll. Let the people have the good, clean stuff; hope to see those packs keep going out too, Aidoneus :)

				I&#039;ve ordered tryptonite and the molly was as pure as it gets. Seemed like a lot of the stuff I&#039;ve gotten from Ivory or Dutchabod. Good luck....
