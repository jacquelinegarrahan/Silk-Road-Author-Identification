				you basically have 30-40 seconds to smoke &amp; hold in as much as u possibly can anything after that is wasted dmt. if you dont breakthrough take bigger hits next time and hold them in til you forget u have to breathe lol I personally love dmt I dont however like needles so i dont see myself trying that route anytime soon or ever.

				Must&#039;ve been shit DMT then. I had it and the first time I breathed it in through a normal pipe (not a bong) sprinkled on some baccy and got nice and fucked up. Second time wasn&#039;t as good, but still amazing.

				I wondered the same thing myself not too long ago. Never did DMT, just thought it might be even more insane to IV. I&#039;m told it&#039;s a lame waste of DMT.
