				So I was preparing for my first purchase and read through a lot regarding the bitinstant method and going to pay at CVS.<br /><br />When I picked up the red phone, I went through the automated service, and then it transferred me to a real person asking for the same information (Name, phone number, amount, etc). But he also asked me my mailing address, saying it&#039;s just in case the money fails to go through. I wasn&#039;t expecting this at all, and froze and gave my real mailing address (Also the address I am shipping the goods to).<br /><br />I know buying bitcoins is legal, but this still gets me nervous. Does it matter/raise any flags?<br /><br />I&#039;m also a paranoid person in general, which doesn&#039;t help my case at all.<br /><br />Any helpful insight would really help! Also maybe why some moneygram&#039;s ask for a mailing address and some don&#039;t?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				You will be fine. As you said, buying BTC is perfectly legal. Acting nervous and giving a fake address would be much more of a red flag. I don&#039;t personally use BitInstant anymore but I have in the past and always used my real information when asked. I also know plenty of people that still do and have never had any issues.&nbsp;

				Go to Wal-Mart next time.&nbsp; You can use a fake name.&nbsp; (It must match up with whatever you put into BitInstant/ZipZap, however).

				I was nervous about linking my bank account to coinbase and I totally understand, and I think it&#039;s a good thing to be nervous.<br />I&#039;ve heard the best way to go about&nbsp; buying BTC is by using Bank of America, you can pay in cash and it goes to bitfloor, which is a trusted site for a lot of older users.<br /><br />

				What&#039;s this red phone you&#039;re talking about. I went to CVS and didn&#039;t see one. Do I need to ask the employees? What would I ask? What kind of information do I need? Sorry for the barrage of questions, there is a CVS near me and I don&#039;t have a bank account. I haven&#039;t been able to get bitcoins yet and want to use this method.
