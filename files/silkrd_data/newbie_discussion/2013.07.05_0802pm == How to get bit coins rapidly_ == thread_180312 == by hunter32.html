				Hello all, I just discovered the deep web and I really like it, it&#039;s just incredible! Anyway, I started this topic to ask some things...How can I get bit coins? This subject is too complex for me, I cannot understand much of your guides...Can you summarize the various ways for me please? Those sites where you complete polls for bit coins are useless, right? And another thing, is mining useful for earning btc?

				Take the time to learn, this is the only sensible way.<br /><br />Mining for coins is useless now. The best way to get coins depends on where you live, but www.localbitcoins.com brings buyers and sellers together, has escrow facilities and can be anonymous if you trade cash, or as quick as an hour or two if you do a bank transfer.

				Localbitcoins. <br /><br />Find a high feedback vendor that uses a bank close to you. <br /><br />If you want, send them a message and ask if they are there. <br /><br />Then go through localbitcoins, request the amount of bitcoins you want, go to the bank, deposit the cash equivalent to the bitcoins, and when you get home, you should have your bitcoins.<br /><br />It&#039;s that easy, or should be

				Yes you can meet face to face, using the code system.<br /><br />Or if the seller accepts bank deposits you can request bitcoins from them - they are put into escrow - then you put cash into their bank account (or do internet transfer if you want to do that). When they notice that the money is there, they release the bitcoins from escrow. It is easy, quick, and the cash methods are anonymous for you, the buyer.

				Just listen to the above, Localbitcoins.com is the one, you can do bank transfer, over the counter in most banks, or cash. It&#039;s escrow also so you wont get stung.<br />If you want to get robbed and have a bad start to your SR adventures then go to mt gox or some such poppycock

				I&#039;m not a happy customer at bitinstant. Logged in one day, my funds were gone, never received them. <br />MtGox changed for the worse. <br /><br />So I assume this one is getting popular these days.<br />It looks much easier too.<br />https://moneypaktrader.com/

				I don&#039;t get the fears with BitInstant. As long as you move your coins through a few wallets, I don&#039;t see what the problem is. I&#039;ve used them for about a year and have never had a problem.

Rates &quot;as low as&quot; 20%? I could browse on here and find someone to do it for less than 15% and even that is alot when you consider the low cost of localbitcoins. Idk to each their own but personally I&#039;d rather spend that extra 10-15% on more goods.
