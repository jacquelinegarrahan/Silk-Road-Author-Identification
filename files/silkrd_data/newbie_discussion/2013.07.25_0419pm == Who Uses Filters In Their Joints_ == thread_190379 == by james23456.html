				I always use a filter in any joint that I smoke, as I find that using a filter gives a much smoother smoke and doesn&#039;t give me a bad, itchy throat. I&#039;m talking about the little white foam ones that come in boxes of 100&#039;s. They do NOT prevent THC from going through, just other nasties. Who else uses them, and what are people&#039;s opinions of them? In contrast, I never use &#039;roaches&#039; (piece of rolled up cardboard). <br /><br />I had to post this in the &#039;newbie&#039; forum due to the number of posts I have.

				Well I&#039;m from the UK so practically everybody here rolls there joints with tobacco and sticks a roach in it. I have never seen anyone use a filter but have always been curious as to what difference it would make. I personally, have always been told that it blocks out some of the THC (probably just bullshit stoner logic.)&nbsp; :-\

				i stuff my own cigarettes and from the tobacco forums, the general consensus is that what you taste or experience from the cigarette is what is being &quot;steamed&quot; &amp; released from the the tobacco just behind the burning coal. The smoke is combusted material, and even if it were THC, once combusted it&#039;s no longer THC.<br /><br />The filter would, by it&#039;s very nature, whether organic material (cotton) or polyester filter, have to reduce the amount of the THC and other items that have gassed off the mj just behind the burning coal - cotton would absorb it, while with polyester filters it&#039;s clinging to the fibers.<br /><br />I suspect you&#039;re just smoking harder or taking a few extra draws and not noticing that you&#039;ve taken extra hits to get the same level of high<br /><br />just 02 from an old fart, can&#039;t really state the above scientifically 100% &quot;moses with the tablets in hand&quot; proven. <br /><br />For a smoother smoke (less throat harshness) you might try regulating your mj to 65-75% RH (relative humidity). Pipe and cigar smokers do this for that very purpose with their humidors - they get more of the true flavor from the tobacco and it smokes smoother to the tongue &amp; throat. When i first got into SYO (stuff your own) cigs, i was happy just as long as the tobacco wasn&#039;t corn flakes dry, when stuffing. When i finally tested the RH out of curiosty one day, i was surprised it was showing 50%. I bought a cheap hygrometer (can be had at amazon etc) for $7 shipped and put the tobacco into a large tupperware with a cup containing some salt heavy with water and let it sit 24 hours. Humidity level was up to 72% and i couldn&#039;t believe how much more pleasant the same tobacco smoked &amp; tasted.<br /><br />It really is worth the effort to regulate your smoking material to 65-75% RH - a cheap &amp; fast way to save messing with a hygrometer - wet salt will regulate the atmosphere to 75% RH. Take a plastic jar lid maybe 2&quot; dia X 3/4&quot; deep, place two tablespoons salt with enough water to wet it - do not stir or mix it up. Tip lid to one side, if you see water &quot;pond&quot; to the low side, there&#039;s too much water, pour the excess out. Salt will, if the atmosphere is lower than 75%, release moisture into the environment. IF higher than 75%, it will draw it out of the atmosphere. The above trick with salt is used to calibrate hygropmeters, btw.<br /><br />If the mj is real dry, and even if not, if you&#039;re in an airconditioned environment, it will dry out fast. For example, when i&#039;m stuffing smokes, i&#039;ll dump out enough tobacco on the table to stuff approx 70-80 smokes. I can stuff 20 cigs in about 4.5 minutes. By the time i&#039;ve stuffed 60 or so smokes, i can feel the tobacco has gone from the right moisture to dry as toast (or corn flake dry).&nbsp; So if your mj is dry, the salt will dry out overnite - add a tablespoon of water and let sit a little longer.<br /><br />Another tip - do not store it in the freezer or refrig - those will dry it out. Even in tupperware or plastic bags, moisture will migrate out - slower than if it was left on an open plate, but will still dry out. That&#039;s why potatoe chip bags have that foil (metalized) surface on the interior side - the metalized deposit better seals moisture in. That&#039;s also why the vendors are using moisture barrier bags to ship in, not so much moisture containment but vapor (smell) containment.<br /><br />fwiw

				on the &quot;...the general consensus is that what you taste or experience from the cigarette is what is being &quot;steamed&quot; &amp; released from the the tobacco just behind the burning coal....&quot;, an interesting way to test if this is true with mj, ie the high is coming from the vapors steaming off the strands just behind the coal, it might be interesting to set up a controlled &#039;burn&quot;, maybe heating a small spoon of mj to the point where it&#039;s starting to smoke but not burn and inhale that to see if you still get high. If it works, it&#039;d mean more mileage from your stash - ie re-using it a 2nd or 3rd time if possible, without inhaling any of the smoke with whatever carcinogens the combustion process is creating.

				I like a nice glass pipe or water pipe. With quality properly raised cannabis I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much to worry about from a little smoke.

All compounds change when combusted - best example of a jekyl to hyde change, i worked with silicone, we&#039;d brought in a retired research lab chief from DOW Chem for consultation. Pure silicone is so non-toxic, you can drink it and it will pass thru you (in fact, for those old enough, it was the secret ingredient in Brylcream, the hair cream sold back in the 60s/70s with the ditty &quot;a little dab will do you and last all day&quot;) - but burn silicone and it becomes formaldehyde, which is very carcinogenic.<br /><br />cig tobacco, phillip morris pioneered adding amnonia, as it creates the &quot;crack&quot; of nicotene - the nicotene hits your blood stream 33x than pipe or cigar tobacco. The effect is an addiction that is hard to break. When i first starting smoking SYO cigs, my consumption went up for the first couple of weeks - my body was looking for that stronger fix of nicotene - after a few weeks it started coming down. I went from smoking 2-3 packs a day to 12-18 cigs a day. Big big difference<br /><br />fwiw

				I have done in the past but I defo seem to get less high when I do. Sometimes I stuff a piece of filter in the roach if the spliff is a harsh throat tickler&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Another health aspect of filters&nbsp; is that you&#039;re breathing in particles of the filter fibre which probably can&#039;t be too good for your lungs.

				I might give conventional paper roaches another try, but I definitely think you get a smoother smoke from a joint with a cig filter in as opposed to a piece of cardboard. I definitely get high, that&#039;s for sure, but less high than if I used a roach? I&#039;ll experiment&nbsp; :)

				*I forgot to note that I always use a filter/roach when I roll my own joints. Makes it a little easier, I think. More aesthetically pleasing to me. Maybe it&#039;s just a personal preference thing.

				Use a bong and smoke the stuff pure, much greater experience then smoking joints ( and also more healthier..) without taking the distinctive taste of the smoke away.

Any kind of non-glossy cardboard rolled into a cylinder, and then put at one end of the roller machine to make the cigarette easier to hold.

My two year kick of rolling blunts with dutch masters was probably worse than being a cigarette smoker. It&#039;s kind of funny that at the time I was so damn smug about being a non-smoker, but was likely a nicotine addict in denial with all those outer leafs.
