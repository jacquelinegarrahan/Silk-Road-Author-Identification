				Enter The Matrix<br /><br />I was originally going to get Lucydrop stuff but right about the time I was going to buy the crazyness with him started, I got scared and picked what I thought was the next best .<br /><br />Now I see threads listing him as a scammer and he seems to have been deleted off SR

				That&#039;s why weed dealers are the best imo. I have never been ganked by a weed dealer. It&#039;s not worth it. And as far as being on here. I think I have said it at least twice in two days. This is buyer beware at its highest level. Man I get it really sucks, I have prepared myself for that happening to me. I will trade this in for whatever I may purchase and the chance that losing my btc that comes with it, over dealing with the same type of person in real life. And the threat of violence. going some place in some town that I should not be. That is your trade off. It could have been someone in real life putting a gun to your head and taking all your shit. <br /><br />This was not an attack, just a thought. Brought to you by the number G and M. Happy shopping and safe escaping. =) <br />I also appologize for being an asshole if I came off that way. I have trouble wording simple minded shit. So, how about we hug it out bitch?

				Yeah, If they are scammers they have done it before. I am sure they got beatings for it too. I know they have karma points on here, but karma can be a real bitch in real life. And that&#039;s, real.
