				first work on your isp not identifying you use tor. this can be done by bridges. receiving packages are everyone&#039;s concern. read reviews on how good packaging is from different vendors. some really dont give a shit some take their time. but the ones that do take there time customers complain about it taking to long. there should be a better system in place on packaging.

Every second theirs a illicit purchase, they cannot stop. Every minute there&#039;s a delivery which they cannot stop. Every day BTC is turned into real tender which they cannot stop. Every day grows a vendor everyday there grows a buyer.<br />The war on drugs is lost. The banks and the government have lost.

				They have not lost, but they will never win neither.<br />The war on drugs will always continue.<br />As the buyers and sellers gets better and better technology to run the drug trading, the government gets the same technology to fight it..<br />

External factors such as streets. But with SR they have lost. Sr gets media attention but the government act quickly to bring any article down. They dont want any more attention to SR then it already does. But that doesnt go to say they wont bring it down. We l have to wait and see. But in my opinion SR was the biggest slap to the gov on drugs.

				and the creation of BTC which can be traced but both systems worked perfectly in synergy. Theres loads of vendors on here that lack the&nbsp; slight bit of knowledge on how to completely stay anonymose. picking and selecting customers, l.e alert, and the main objective getting there money in there hands clean. If everyone had access to this information then the Sr platform would be even more secure. the funny thing is theres so many people here with potential. good on you guys and good luck.
