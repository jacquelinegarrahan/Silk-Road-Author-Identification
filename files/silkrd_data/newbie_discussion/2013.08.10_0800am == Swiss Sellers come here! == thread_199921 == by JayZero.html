				Good morning my fellow roadies!<br /><br />I am looking for a or multiple seller/s in Switzerland. I talked to one guy, he seems to be cool but he hasn&#039;t everything that I want. And I heard the delivery rates to Switzerland are pretty bad, that&#039;s why I don&#039;t really want to order from any other country. Domestic shipping should be fine.<br /><br />So if you know someone or you are a swiss dealer leave a note here or hit me up with a PM with your offerings

				Set your location to Switzerland, and tick the domestic option and go shopping on the road.

And the other one sold stuff I didn&#039;t want to buy. So I thought I post here because some of the guys have their destination &quot;undeclared&quot; and then I can&#039;t see from which country they are, but maybe they are here in the forums somewhere.<br /><br />Maybe someone from Switzerland will post here<br /><br />(Sorry for my bad English)
