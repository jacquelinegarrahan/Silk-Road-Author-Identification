				I first heard about it last year. A kid told me he ordered drugs online, and i called him crazy and laughed... <br />This march my connect ran dry, and for whatever reason i seen some news about SR. So i did some research, figured out how to purchace BTC and how to PGP.<br />After taking the time to learn all of this and seeing how its set up and secured and anonymous this all is.. hell why would anyone leave :) <br />Thank you DPR!!

				heard about it so many different places it&#039;s hard to remember which was the first.<br /><br />never thought I&#039;d end up using it but then found reason too, and the fact that it&#039;s better than using any other resource I have has kept me coming back

				Heard about it through Reddit, I think. I knew about it for a long time but never bothered to order anything or check it out. <br />I was also folllowing the entire bitcoin saga since &#039;10.

ASIC mining and such. This guy I bought bitcoins from was telling me about his setup. Sounds slick as fuck but has a high initial investment. You can get it back in 2-3 months though

				First heard about it on Topix., about 16 months ago. Took me almost a month to find the real site address, there was very little info on it back then.<br />My first bitcoin cost about £4.00 (GBP)<br />And what keeps me is the drugs and the people on the SR forums, there are some really good and funny people here and plenty to keep me entertained.<br />&nbsp;Plus I like to help out when I can, just as I was helped out when I was a newbie.

				Heard about it through a friend of a friend who had some of CloudSurfer&#039;s amazing MDMA on hand as proof. Down the hatch a point of that went and from then onwards I had to be a part of this unique dealings of drugs.<br /><br />What&#039;s kept me here is vendors good stealth, limited drops gets stressful. Also the fact that an entire world of drugs was now open to me. The biggest staying point is the price though.. Being from Australia where drug prices are through the roof. For the same price as you pay for 1g of MDMA you can get enough to last 6 months. <br /><br />Privileged to have such a service. I still remember getting that first o/s order&nbsp; :) gold

				I guess I was drunk and looked up how to buy drugs online and I was telling everyone about it while I was wasted....and then I forgot and a few weeks later people were asking me how everything was going with my online drugs and I went back and figured it all out!<br /><br />What&#039;s kept me here? The consistency. The products. The vendors. The people. <br /><br />How fucking great was it to receive your first envelope all weird and blank with blank papers and a quarter gram of some powder drug inside it?! Almost as good as the high itself! My first order was some MDMA and I got it the night (like that day, just in time **DeStInY**) I was supposed to see Wolfgang Gartner. Everyone told me I was an idiot for trusting drug dealers online. Well my g/f and I had an awesome fucking time rolling while everyone else had some shit Methylone cut with crap!!! <br /><br />Needless to say I started dealing MDMA capsules and yeah, I&#039;ve stayed ever since. <br /><br />fuckin&#039; sick shit, man

				I came here because dealers fucking suck. You&#039;d think because selling drugs is their only source of income, they&#039;d want to make as many sales as possible and rake in the cash, but they just stop replying, or start doing hard drugs and become a pain in the ass to talk about. I stay here because I can deal with vendors who have great prices, high quality, and when I order something I don&#039;t have to wait wondering if I&#039;m gonna get a message back or if it will arrive. I also like being able to find reviews on products to see what other people on the road think about products. It really is a beautiful system that forces high quality and great service.
