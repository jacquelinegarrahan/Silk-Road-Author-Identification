				I used BI 2 days ago, it took 12 hours to deposit a CVS cash deposit directly to my SR account and I had to send a customer service request. I used it a month prior to fund my mt.gox usd and it took about 3 hours after I submitted another live chat request.

				Maybe you entered in the wrong email or something, but its probably due to them being backed up. I&#039;ve been using them for a while, an anytime I wasn&#039;t totally satisfied Charlie Shern responded personally and made things right. I would follow the contact info on the site, and if they don&#039;t get back to you email Charlie directly.

				BitInstant seems to be having problems with processing since last friday, as the volume of trading in BTC skyrockted and then came crashing down due to overinflation and speculation.&nbsp; There are several other threads with Op&#039;s citing similar problems, and if you don&#039;t get it by tomorrow, you should contact their support until it has been rectified to your satisfaction.&nbsp; Search for BitInstant on the Forums home page to pull up the threads.

				Last deposit i made went smooth but about 2 or 3 weeks before that maybe mid march or so i made a deposit and it took like 3 days to show up on mtgox.&nbsp; but its a legit buisness so i wasnt worried.&nbsp; i mean could they just take your money b/c funding a mtgox account isnt illegal?
