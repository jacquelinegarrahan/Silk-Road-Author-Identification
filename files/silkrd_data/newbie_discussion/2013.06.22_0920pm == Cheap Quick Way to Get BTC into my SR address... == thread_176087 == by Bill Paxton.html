				As you can see from my stats I&#039;ve been a busy bee on Silk Road.<br /><br />Most all of my deposits have been through bitinstant and I was happy to use them.<br /><br />They&#039;ve changed their page and for the last week or so I&#039;ve not been able to use them.&nbsp; In addition I keep reading horror stories, not to mention one of my own that included me depositing BTC the weekend after they were hacked (I don&#039;t watch the news, had no idea they were hacked) and i had to wait about a week to get my BTC.<br /><br />I switched over to bitfloor and really liked them but they&#039;re no - more... <br /><br />any suggestions for a good cheap way to get my BTC into my account?&nbsp; <br /><br />Silk Road vender&#039;s charge waaay too much for me when using moneypak/Greendot etc... If I buy a greendot card with $500.00 on it, after the transaction fee&#039;s I&#039;m charged I only get about $440.00 into my account which is just absurd.<br /><br />Help please!!<br /><br />

				Using MoneyHoney and coinexpress (I may be spelling that wrong) works well and they are EXCELLENT venders.Plus when you use them the chances of anything being traced back to you is silch but the % rates are just SO much higher than what I&#039;m comfortable paying. Alot of my purchases are for re-selling so minimizing costs is always something I&#039;m trying to do. I was more than happy to pay the $25.00 (total) it would typically cost for a bitinstant transaction. Bitfloor was even better as the USD would show in my account minutes after depositing into a BOA.with bitfloor I would have to then exchange/buy BTC with my USD THEN send it to my SR account but the cost was still minimal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody use MTgox? I hear them mentioned alot but thought you had to verify actual real info with them/prove you were a real person instead of staying anonymous through and through which is obviously important. <br /><br />-Billy P.&nbsp;

				Moneypak or reloadit to BTC from a trustworthy vendor is a fast way. True some have fees 10% to 15% but it is one of the quickest ways to get started and is fairly anonymous.

				BitInstant isn&#039;t cheap, but they&#039;re quick.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know they had been hacked...&nbsp; am assuming it was a while ago, but I also tried to use them about a week or so ago and they weren&#039;t accepting cash/moneygram while they were re-doing their site or whatever they were doing.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, they are now taking cash/MG again - same price, same ZipZap, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also, Nanaimogold is as fast as BitInstant and they don&#039;t ask for as much personal info, but they&#039;re at least as costly if not even more so.&nbsp; &nbsp;Especially if you use their guaranteed same day service only good through making cash payment through Western Union.&nbsp; But if you want to use cash, and use Nanaimogold.... WU is the way to go (even if you don&#039;t pay extra for same day service) because they also take MoneyGram, but they only pick up those like two or three times a week....&nbsp; they pick up WU every evening except Sunday....<br /><br />Other than those two, while aware of others, I don&#039;t like the idea of giving out my bank account number, or much personal info at all... so, the two mentioned are the only one&#039;s I&#039;m familiar with that accept cash transfers.<br /><br />If anyone knows of any other places to get BTC that accepts cash, I&#039;d appreciate the info.&nbsp; Thanks :)<br />&nbsp;

				With bitinstant you don&#039;t have to provide any real information. All you have to do is provide a name and birthdate, this could be anyone in the world besides you. But it has to match up otherwise it will not work

				Solid venders doing REloadit/MoneyPak for fast BTC (I would suggest messaging them first as sometimes they&#039;ll take up to 24 hours if they&#039;re busy):&nbsp; MoneyHoney / Money Honey .... CoinXchange (MY FAVORITE) ... Also ..&nbsp; JumboMonkeyBiscuit<br /><br />CoinXchange is hands down my favorite as his rates are best and he&#039;s speedy.<br /><br />MoneyHoney comes in 2nd because of rates but getting him to respond to messages sometimes takes some time.<br /><br />JumoMonkeyBiscuit is awesome but his rates are pretty much stuck at 15% unless you spend over 3k in one month (I&#039;m not sure if they reset every month)<br /><br />Thanks for you info about BitInstant, Where we live, we go into CV$ and we never give real names and we NEVER supply them with ID.... One time they asked for ID and my money dropper simply argued with them explaining that Bitinstant doesn&#039;t require one (which they don&#039;t)... when the asshole kept asking for one they simply walked out... Only once have we been asked for ID with CV$.<br /><br />Hope this helps, its helped me.. will try bitinstant again.<br /><br />

				Another vote for localbitcoins.com. I recently did my first transaction for that vendor&#039;s $50 minimum to complete the funds needed for a purchase. It was fast and very low fee...2% over Mt. Gox.<br /><br />I used to just do wire transfer to Mt. Gox but the fees were just out of this world. I&#039;ve yet to use a SR vendor but localbitcoins is probably where I&#039;ll keep doing business for the forseeable future.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176087.msg1265892#msg1265892">Quote from: rock_lobster on June 23, 2013, 11:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve had smooth transactions using localbitcoins.com<br /><br />I saw it recommended here and for me it&#039;s the best-simplest and fastest.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I just used Coinbase, which took a week, but I was in no hurry and now that it is set up it is all good and runs smoothly.&nbsp; I just use that and promptly send to my desktop wallet then put what I need into my SR account.&nbsp; It is all pretty swift and convenient.&nbsp;

				I used LocalBitCoins.com today and it worked like a charm. I was able to use a vender who took Money Gram so I placed my order, went to a local store to deposit/transfer my funds (WHICH ARE HELD IN ESCROW UNTIL YOU GET YOUR BTC).<br /><br />Although it seems to be cheapest to meet people in person for a number of different reasons its easier/quicker/safer to do one of MANY DEPSOIT METHODS.... There was bank OA WeltsFartGo etc.. Also MoneyPak and fore mentioned MoneyGram...<br /><br /><br />It was still a pretty expensive but I did a very small deposit.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be loving it for my 500-1k BTC purchases no doubt. <br /><br />Hello LocalBitCoins, good bye BitInstant!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;
