				New to bitcoins and i have noticed over the last week, btc has nearly doubled in price??<br />Im aware the value shifts, sorta like the stock market, but can someone inform me as to how long these value shifts go for?<br />Im sure value goes up a few weeks before every major holidays lol...<br />Cant find decent charts over a long enough period to make my own judgement.<br />Any info appreciated.

				I dont think its doubled in a week but it&#039;s doubled in about a month or so. <br />It&#039;s pretty impossible to know whats going to happen with them, personally I think they will keep rising with occasional drops. Im waiting for it to drop to buy some so hopefully that happens!

				ok a few weeks :) but it has risen a fair heap. So it has steadily risen over a long period?<br />Thinking about waiting for a drop and purchase a large amount of btc if its going to keep rising.

				hi, I am new to sr and btc but I dived in and bought 10 btc for around £600 invluding fees etc and spent 3. it could go in my favour if the value rises or if they fall then I have lost out but it is obviously a call for each individual to make.<br /><br />I was reading a thread here earlier from only a few months ago where people were umming and arring about buying a bulk purchase and the price was only single figures per btc not the nearly £60 they are today, who knows they could be £100 in a few months or they could be back to low single figures.....watch this space. <br /><br />me personally I am going to buy another 10 btc this weekend as a long term investment, but I can afford to lose it, I would be gutted but dont see much difference between dabbling here with btc or giving money fo a fund manager and investing in shares. <br /><br />

				I started learning about Bitcoin when it was at $19 in February and have watched in climb, soar, and race to $50, then to $60, and onward to over $80. I did not know enough about it or have the motivation at $20 to invest the money. If you think they are going to rise and have the spare cash to spend invest and watch it closely. You can get apps on your phone to notify you of price drops and increases and also monitor your exchange of choice (e.g. Campbx, Mt. Gox..). Even if you only buy one Bitcoin and make $10, it is a good feeling to be a part of something successful that so many discredit only because they do not understand the economic and political climate.

				I was thinking the same thing yesterday. I started using BTC when it was $30 and change, and now its over $87. I see it going to $100 in about 3 weeks or less, I&#039;m calling it from now. I might just buy 2BTC and sit on it then flip it back when the price jumps in another week or more.

				They were around $5.00 a coin when I started. I didn&#039;t know what to do when they hit like 13 or 14, now $80.00+ I wish I would&#039;ve bought more coins back then.

				When I began to use BTC, they where like $7. I dont believe they will hit or break $100 any time soon, but over all, I dont for see BTC going back down to single digits ever again. Prob back down to the $30-$50 mark, until the next big spike shows its ugly face.

Usually u cant buy bitcoins instantly. U have to wait at least a few hours, mostly one day. The last crash was 20€ less/bitcoin in 2 hours. So it really is some kind of gamble actually. It should keep going up if u hear what the pros are saying tho.

I guess I didnt know how good my coke really was just a couple years ago b/c I was flipping fish scale at $60/gram and still making very good profit. I don&#039;t see how the prices can be justified where they are at now.
