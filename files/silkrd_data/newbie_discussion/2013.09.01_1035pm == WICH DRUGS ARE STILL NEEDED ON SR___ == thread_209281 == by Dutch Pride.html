				There isn&#039;t really a cheap escrow pure cocaine vendor out there. Prices are way to high.<br />People have said it again and again on here. PCP would do well as there are no vendors selling it.<br />Then of coarse there are many chemicals people would kill for, the one I want the most is 4-mar. <br /><br />I say just list every drug you can, higher quality, and cheaper, than any other vendor :D

				I&#039;d have to say mescaline powder/crystals as well. I&#039;ve only ever tried the cacti. I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s not more common on SR actually, since mescaline is THE classic psychedelic if you ask me, even more so than LSD.
