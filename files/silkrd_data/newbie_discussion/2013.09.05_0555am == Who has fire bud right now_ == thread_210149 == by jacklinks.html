				I feel like I&#039;m out of the loop a bit, my usual vendors are out of stock. I&#039;d like some fire (1oz to a QP) but I don&#039;t want to pay anything over 300/oz

				Depends on what kind of stuff you like but...<br /><br />I&#039;d try:<br /><br />NW Nugz, HeartOfHumboldt, Midwestern Medical, ogbryan, PrivateReserve, or LucyMcgee. I haven&#039;t tried muskabuzz, but their stuff looks pretty awesome.

				Never heard of fire bud, but did a quick search and it&#039;s definitely something I&#039;d like to try. <br /><br />So it has higher THC concentration. Is there a noticeable difference when you hit it?

				Fire bud is just a slang term for really good weed...You&#039;ll see lots of sellers refer to their stuff as fire.<br /><br />I live in the Upper Midwest and I hadn&#039;t heard the term until I joined SR.

				maybe its just me but whenever someone would try to sell me anything with the name &quot;Chronic, Haze, Fire, Kush, Sticky, or purple&quot; then I get really suspicious, cause whenever someone would say that the weed would turn out to be dirt, literal dirt, colored with sharpie to look purple/red or dipped in soda to feel sticky, but maybe thats just the scumbags I knew, vendors for mj on here dont seem to want to steal pennies on the dollar from us but i would still just go with some high quality weed from UnderGroundSyndicate, arrives on time, great stealth, and very nice product
