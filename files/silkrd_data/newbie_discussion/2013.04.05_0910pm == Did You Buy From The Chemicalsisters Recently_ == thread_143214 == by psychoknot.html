				This is a crosspost from the Rumor Mill Section. <br /><br />I&#039;m starting to notice a several customer reviews on their vendor page stating that their package did not arrive. <br />I understand ordering from The Netherlands comes with a certain degree of risk but their price and product <br />review were very enticing. However, none of the reviews that state that they &quot;did not receive their package&quot;<br />provide any context as to which country they were from. So my question(s) is: <br /><br />If you ordered from the Chemicalsisters some time after March 23rd, when they came back from their little hiatus, <br />have you or have you not receive your package yet? Or if you have placed an order with them in the past, did it ever arrive? <br /><br />I understand that the package might take longer than expected but this is just more of an inquiry, more of a curiosity, that I have. <br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />psychoknot<br />

I hope it works out for you. If you don&#039;t mind me asking. Are you a US customer? I&#039;m trying to see if there is a pattern with undeliverable packages that are being sent to the US. The reviews on the vendor page are extremely helpful but like I mentioned earlier, there&#039;s no context as to which country those packages are not reaching. That would surely help out buyers from the US make a wiser decision. Ultimately, it&#039;s their choice but the information will be there for them if they decide to use it.

				I bought from them, it&#039;s been over 15 days so had to do an extension. Seems like they may have gone rogue or had a problem with their packages being intercepted. <br /><br />Think I may try and ask for a refund if these reports keep up.

				ask for the refund. a lot of people on the forums have been asking for 100%. since chemicalsisters responds slow, sometimes SR admins step in and give the 100%
