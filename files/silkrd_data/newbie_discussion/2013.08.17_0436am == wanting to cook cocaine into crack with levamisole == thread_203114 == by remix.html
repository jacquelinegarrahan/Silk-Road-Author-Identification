				Put them both together and cook it as you would baking soda. Although unless you have a lot of it I would just use the baking soda

I&#039;ve cooked a bit, but nothing on the level that you are talking about.<br /><br />Your best bet would be to try to cook up a couple zones using different mixtures and pass product to find out what gave the best result - then go with that.
