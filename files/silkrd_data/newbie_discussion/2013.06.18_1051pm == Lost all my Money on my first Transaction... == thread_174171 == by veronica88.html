				wow man, that really is a bummer. not to sound like a dick or anything, but you most likely didnt do your research when looking up who you were doing biz with<br /><br />what you should do when handling that much money on the road...<br /><br />1. decipher the feedback and see if it adds up to his services, such as detailed 5/5 feedbacks that sound like real humans and not shill accounts.<br />2. look up the vendor here in the forums and look for high post count users that provide detailed reviews and vouches for that vendor<br />3. MAKE SURE YOU USE ESCROW ALWAYS!!!<br />4. repeat steps 1-2 MULTIPLE Times untill you are without a doubt certain they are not a scammer and will provide you with what they provide..<br /><br />i&#039;ve been scammed out of a 135$ moneypak the first time i came on here from what looked like a reputable seller. sorry to hear you got scammed but, it happens to the people who are least informed. <br /><br />spend some time on here and just read man, thats all I can say besides the stuff i said above. :/ <br />hope you didnt lose the wrong type of persons money.<br /><br />be safe! <br />the Weeknd

				i feel your pain, but for your first 8 to 10 purchases on SR, you should probably only spend 700 Euros total on all of those orders.&nbsp; You need to read all feedback, check the forums, and when you are going to spend that amount of money, make sure you also have good communication with the vendor.&nbsp; Lastly, if you have enough purchases under your belt, you will never have to FE for something like that which would avoid a scamming all together.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sorry to hear about that, but aside from a few bad eggs, SR is full of dynamite vendors that are incredible honest and communicative.

				Could have been worse, you could be in JAIL right now with a FELONY. Ask anyone I&#039;m not joking ask anyone that uses this website it is ESSENTIAL that you read all the rules/suggestions/comments whatever know everything before you just start handing shady people money in shady ways for drugs. Research and then you can be confident that not only will your transactions go smooth you won&#039;t have much worse consequences (which are a reality, don&#039;t kid yourself).

				Sounds like you jumped into the deep end of the pool without learning how to swim first.<br />Were you trying to buy bitcoins??? If so, there&#039;s better ways to do it than going out oif escrow and trusting a stranger . At least start off with some small transactions.

				Hey Veronica88, <br />i know how you feel, ive been scammed quite a few times, for thousands of $$.&nbsp; Its hard to avoid, but the general rule is &quot;if its too good to be true, it probably is&quot;<br />Try using trusted websites like mtgox and virwox to buy bitcoins, instead of trusting a vendor to give them to you.&nbsp; It may be more work on your part, and cost a bit more in the end, but it will be much less frustrating overall, and give you peace of mind that your hard earned money will actually make it to sr.<br />just my .02.&nbsp; happy travels<br />&nbsp;8)

				Veronica.....A few weeks ago I would say use blockchain which utilizes bitinstant or go straight to bitinstant and bypass blockchain, but, now, for me at least, neither of them seem to be working. Try localbitcoins.com. You can buy BTC&#039;s using western union, moneygram , direct bank deposit and loads of other methods, as well as meeting so meone local and buying them which I don&#039;t think is illegal in any way. This site uses an escrow system just like the Road . It&#039;s worked&nbsp; fine for me so far.
