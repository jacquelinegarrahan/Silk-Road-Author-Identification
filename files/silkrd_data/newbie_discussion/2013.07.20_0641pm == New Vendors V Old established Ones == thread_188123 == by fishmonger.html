				Hey ,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to the forum but not the road . I used to think that if I chose a new Vendor the odds on me getting problems were smaller . They don&#039;t have the volume so can give good service and they&#039;re not going to send crap because they want a good rep . I know that there are some predators on our side ( buyers) that see them a soft target and try to screw extra out of them but from my experience with these guys have been good . HOWEVER things seem to be changing , I got screwed by gque for more than I want to think about and this guy had only been around 2 months . I think this is probably part of the roads evolution , bent vendors coming back with a new name and modus operandi but its now making me wary of new vendors ( was gque , Annanas Express ? ) .<br /><br />On a sub note why does S/R let Vendors that went rogue back . After a few months the (feedback) slate gets wiped and they start building rep again , I know they are going to do the same thing again to new people that feels really wrong to me .
