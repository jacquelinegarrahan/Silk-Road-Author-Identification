				sorry to dbl post BUT....<br /><br />just wanted to add... obviously DO NOT FE with this guy... If you ordered with him and he asked you to FE... let us all know, it will prove he is scamming now.<br /><br />If a vet poster wants to move this to his review thread it would do a lot of good.&nbsp; He is going to take a lot of people&#039;s money!

				Yes I believe this is the case. I ordered priority from him last Monday and still nothing has arrived. No response to any messages, nothing at all. Seems like he is selectively scamming since some people seem to be getting there orders. Just have to hope the resolution center comes through I suppose.

				He came through for me..on the price drop. I dont think hes scamming, as people have speculated this for months now. For the most part, ive yet to see a post claiming they never got their shit from him. Hes just not good at being prompt and orderly is all. <br /><br />There is always the chance hes gone rogue, but its unlikely imo. Aside from all that, his H is OK at best. Go with another vendor from here on out.

				Last week I placed an Express order with him. This was my 2nd order with him. I did receive an incomplete order the next day. I ordered a gram and 2 bags. I received 2 bags and some mints but missing the gram. The bags were fat but not big enough to be the gram I ordered. So I sent him an email. He responded with a link to a reship. He marked it as shipped and its been 6 days since and no delivery and no response since. First of all since my original order was Express that I payed for and since this was his error he should have reshipped express at the very least Priority.. I am assuming he has not used either and I am beginning to think he did not reship at all. And I am starting to see a trail of unhappy customers. But why the fuck are you people not giving him a low rating on his feedback???!!! This is what it is for!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;If I don&#039;t get a healthy replacement order in the next few days I will be demanding a full refund as well as a 1 out of 5 and for good reason. Hes making too many mistakes and refusing to respond to peoples emails. Worst thing a vendor can do.&nbsp; It sucks I am a Newbie and can not yet post on his vendor forum link.

				I ordered with DT a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; I got my stuff and it was good.&nbsp; From the research I&#039;ve done, I think he just goes on benders and lets the business go for a while.&nbsp; He did not require me to FE and it was my 2nd SR purchase for about $200.&nbsp; So, if he is requiring FE, definitely watch out.
