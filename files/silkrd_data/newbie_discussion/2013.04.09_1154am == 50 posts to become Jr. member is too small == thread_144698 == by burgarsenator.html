				I agree.<br />For a scammer, spamming through 50 posts isn&#039;t that much work, when you can scam plenty of good willing customers :/

				I have no problem with having to reach 100-150 posts, before getting access to the other forums.<br />People need to get to know the system anyways, and it would be a lot easier to cut off the scammers! :D

				The problem with 50 posts is for folks like me who have been on the forum for months. I decided to change my user name and then I discovered the freak&#039;n 50 post requirement. It&#039;s a pain in the ass but I guess I&#039;ll have to OBEY and waste my time and YOUR bandwidth posting BS.
