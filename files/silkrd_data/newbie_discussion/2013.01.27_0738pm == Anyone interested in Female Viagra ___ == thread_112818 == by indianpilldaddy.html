				Benefits of Female Viagra (Selling brand Lovegra) - <br /><br />Lovegra is a drug prescribed to women to help them achieve orgasm&#039;s and ehance their sex lives. Lovegra or Filagra Pink as it is known in India under the Dadha brand name is a medication invented to help women who suffer from sexual disorder. This is where a woman fails to achieve an orgasm. This is common among women generally on birth control. It works of a similar principal to male viagra and contains the same active ingredient Sidenafil Citrate. The active compound helps relax the serotonine muscles in the brain, and also relax&#039;s the muscles surrounding the female ovaries. This allows the female to achieve an orgasam much quicker, and in many cases has being found that the female experiences multiple orgasams.

Sidenafil&nbsp; is a structural analog of guanosine, making it a potent PDE5 inhibitor (ie. its one and only pharmacological effect is dilation of arteries, and thus an increase blood flow through coronary arteries that&#039;s noticeable in the groin region).<br /><br />Women, lacking the male appendage, won&#039;t benefit from this increased blood flow, which simply registers as a mild tingling sensation at best. The placebo effect is a mighty powerful thing, so this slight change in blood flow (when the real difference is in your head) causes some women to report significant &quot;improvement&quot; in their sex lives in some news articles and websites (which, not coincidentally, often sell ED drugs too).<br /><br />If you have a peer-reviewed article that disproves my claims, please share it with us. Potential buyers, don&#039;t hold your breath though - ED drugs are not for women, plain and simple.<br /><br />PS: &quot;serotonine muscles&quot; and &quot;relax&#039;s the muscles surrounding the female ovaries&quot; made me lol hard - whoever wrote this clearly does not understand neurochemistry or the female anatomy.
