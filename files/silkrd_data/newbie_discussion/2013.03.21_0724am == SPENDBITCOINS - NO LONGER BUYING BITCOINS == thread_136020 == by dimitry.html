				Hi<br /><br />I normally exchange my bitcoins to AUD through https://www.spendbitcoins.com/, however they have just announced that they are no longer providing this service. Does anyone know of any companies that will buy Bitcoins and deposit the funds into an Aussie Bank Account.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya

				I am in the process of doing a transfer with BITINNOVATE. Uses similar process to Spendbitcoins, but exchange rate is nowhere near as good. Spendbitcoins had buy sell exchange rates that were within 1BTC of each other, BITINNOVATE has a difference of around 5-6 BTC difference between buy and sell rates, and the exchange rate is significantly lower than spendbitcoins.<br /><br />Thus far it appears that BIT INNOVATE takes longer to do the actual transfer than spendbitcoins did.<br /><br />I am also looking for a site that will deposit directly into a Singaporean or Malaysian Bank account. Spendbitcoins used to have an international bank transfer as an option. Have not been able to find a site that allows international transfer (without too much verification of identity).<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Will keep you all updated.

				Okay, placed a sell order with BIT INNOVATE, and sent the coins on Monday. Promptly received an email saying it has been processed and the coins should arrive in two days. Checked Wednesday evening, and the cash had not arrived. Sent an email to them asking for an update. Received a prompt response indicating the payment had been rejected, because my account number has a dash in it (not many do).&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Apparently they reprocessed the payment on Wednesday night, after making some changes to their processes, so it should arrive soon.. As of 5pm AEST the cash still have not arrived in my account. :o<br /><br />Will update late once i have more information.<br /><br />Update 12/ May 2013<br /><br />Apologies for taking so long to update. I have used Bit Innovate a few times now and whilst i have had a couple of minor hiccups, their service seems pretty good.&nbsp; Latest transfer was for over a thousand dollars, will waiting on that to come through, but i am confident it will work out in the end.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya 8)
