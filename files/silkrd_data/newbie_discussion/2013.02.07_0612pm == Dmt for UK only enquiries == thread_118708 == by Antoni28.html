				Yeh its pretty mad stuff, but dont seem to many people interested for me to start business, could do samples for people if there worried bout me being new vendor, and full escrow through silkroad till delivered recorded so i know package has arrived, so anyone else interested please add to this and i see what i can do for you guys :) peace out

				Personally I&#039;m hugely wary of dealing with anyone without some existing history...<br /><br />Recorded delivery is a &#039;no&#039; from me, however I can see why you would prefer it. I would be interested in standard 1st class RM only.<br /><br />I suggest you consider offering smaller quantities sent without recorded delivery. Maybe 50mg for a tenner or something, comparatively expensive for the purchaser but I would imagine still worth it for you and an opportunity to build some reputation on smaller scale transactions.<br /><br />Hopefully others will be interested too.

				&nbsp;Hey thanks for the advice and yes I could 100mg instead of 50mg for a tenner as I think its a fairer price, sometimes when am onit i want to give it away to everyone I know as I want people to experience this world, but yeh I think I will put up all three weights and see how it goes but yes I could give that option for postage but I worry pepole will stich me up :/ but i guess thats life and karma&#039;s always round :) thanks again for your rplies, if anyoone else would like to comment be good :)

				Dmt is very different, would recommend watching the spiritual molecule but will be providing 100mg samples to 5 people only if feedback can be left for me as am wanting to provide a quality service for uk buyers only, will be providing these free samples end of next week for the first 5 interested in trying regards

				As someone who likes dmt but doesnt want to get shipped overseas, i would love to see a uk vendor on the market. You should definitely go for it.
