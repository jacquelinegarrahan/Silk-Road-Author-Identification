				I am not a vendor, and I am still a newbie myself, but I do know there&#039;s an official guide for sellers, just google &quot;Silk Road Seller&#039;s Guide&quot; ... you don&#039;t even need to use TOR to be able to view it. hope this helps

				I appreciate the work that drug dealers and vendors do but I&#039;d imagine it would be very difficult to make a lot of money doing it without having at least some chance of getting caught.&nbsp; It can&#039;t be an easy job either.&nbsp; Probably best to put your efforts into legal work.&nbsp; At least in the US the penalty for &quot;trafficking&quot; drugs is extreme and then when you get out 20 years later you&#039;re blacklisted by society.

				Unless you have a good business plan and idea on how you will execute it it&#039;s probably worth holding off.&nbsp; Also figure out what your real profit would be and give a serious thought whether it&#039;s really worth the risk...<br /><br />Be safe!

				Hey !<br /><br />Just wanted to point out that when you get vendor status you also get to access the vendor section of the forum, right ?<br /><br />I would think there would be some good advices out there even though I obviously never could have checked it out :)<br /><br />Maybe just pay the vendor fee, keep browsing the forum for a while and come back when all seems ready.
