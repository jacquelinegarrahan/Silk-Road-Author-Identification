				Hello. I&#039;ve made multiple orders on SR vendors without one single problem until now. I placed a small order with a vendor who has been on sr for a year with awesome feedback on their vendors page as well as in the forums. Order was placed on Sunday night for Express Shipping. Still haven&#039;t received order. I sent a polite pm to vendor on tuesday asking if he could give me the tracking number, or if he couldn&#039;t do that at least look it up theirself and please let me know what happened to it, and when should i expect it. He responded back 2 nights ago apologizing, because when he looked up my order he said that it was accidentally sent regular mail. He said the listing that i bought had so many words in it that the Express shipping option was mistakenly not seen. Also, he said that he has never had that particular item shipped express before. He did apologize for that, and asked if i needed him to ship another out that may get their faster than the original order which he said should get here in another 3 days. The other option he gave was to refund the express shipping payment. I&#039;m typing on my cellphone and i have big thumbs, so i hope this is clear in what my dilemma is. I responded asking him if he could overnight one or two pills just so i could have my methadone by Saturday. Don&#039;t even wanna think about the very real possibility of original order not arriving until Monday(fever)(chills)Sweats)(diarrhea)etc. He offered, so yes i asked him to do that for me, but i still feel kinda like a moocher because of that. I&#039;m not, but maybe it looks that way. Also, i have no hard feelings towards vendor other than being a little pissed at the costly mistake of not seeing that i ordered express. I&#039;m not gonna take a shit on him with bad feedback once the order arrives, whenever that will be. Just want my methadones and refund of cost of express shipping which if i remember was close to 35 dollars. Any advice would be most appreciated. If i was typing on a pc, this would be more coherent. Thanks

				&nbsp; &nbsp;No, sorry, don&#039;t fully understand. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You have an order that will probably still come, which you paid express for, but was not sent express. The vendor offered to either refund your postage or overnight some product to get you through. You accepted the o/n product, which I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re not paying extra for. Is that correct so far?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not the smoothest transaction, and I totally sympathise with your withdrawal anxiety, but where now is the issue? Do you want the extra o/n product and your postage refunded?

He didn&#039;t specify amount he would &quot;rush out&quot; this was 36 hours ago that i made that request. I haven&#039;t gotten a response yet, as i&#039;m taking that as a no can do from his end. I understand, and believe him\her that they made an honest mistake and that they truly did &quot;goof&quot;, and missed seeing the express shipping option that i ordered. But like i said, no response in 36 hours, and no transfer of express shipping costs transferred yet back into my account. Coommunication has sucked real bad from this vendor as this is obviously a legitimate complaint. I have 0 auto-finalizations as well as 0 refund rate. I also though when i replied that it was Friday, when it was actually Thursday. They said it should arrive in three days, so maybe order will get here by Saturday. Who knows with usps. He also said regular mail which i don&#039;t know meant first-class or priority. Anyway, i always try to give people benefit of the doubt unless proven otherwise. Not responding to communications is proof of wrong, but going as far as them bullshitting me remains to be seen. So until then i&#039;m just gonna assume that i will receive at least what i ordered, just way later than expected. As far as him/her rushing something out in the meantime: i don&#039;t know if they have done that because of no response from vendor since 2 nights ago. I don&#039;t wanna be one of those annoying &quot;whereis my package&quot;, &quot;where is my package&quot; buyer, but it&#039;s gonna have to turn into that if i don&#039;t hear from them soon and/or get my package by Monday.

				Keep in mind that only in 2013 can you fucking mail-order huge amounts of illegal drugs and realistically expect them to be shipped express with no danger of detection.<br /><br />This would have been unimaginable ten years ago.

				I received order today fortunately. My problem isn&#039;t with the mistake in sending it first-class and not express like i paid for. I have received what i ordered and that is the main thing. We all make mistakes. The vendor apologized in a pm on wednesday for the mistake and said that he would refund the express that i paid for. That was on wednesday and i haven&#039;t received the money back into my account or even gotten a message since. I even responded to their last message to me on wednesday not to worry about me shitting on their feedback when the order came in and finalized it. I kept my word. Gave a 5 out of 5 and basically said it was a fast and flawless transaction. Didn&#039;t even mention the shipping error so as not to tarnish in the least bit his reputation. Transferring bitcoins to another user on sr is an easy, and smooth transaction. Doesn&#039;t take hardly any effort. Why do i feel like i&#039;m not getting my express money back, but the order was sent? It&#039;s puzzling to me, and is starting to piss me off. I work for my money too.

				you need to contact the vendor and be the squeaky wheel about your express shipping refund.
