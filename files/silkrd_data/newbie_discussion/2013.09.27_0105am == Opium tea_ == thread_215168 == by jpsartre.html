				I just got on the road, and I&#039;m so happy with my experience so far. What an awesome community!<br /><br />So, some O came in my mailbox the other day, and I&#039;ve only come across it once before. That time, I think we were about 4 guys (with zero tolerance) who smoked about half a gram and we were in 7th heaven. Does that sound about right?<br /><br />But I&#039;ve heard making tea is more efficient. I think I read somewhere that just dropping 0.2 grams in a cup of hot water with a dash of grapefruit juice would be a great way to consume it. Now I can&#039;t find that source, so I wanted to ask here. <br /><br />Anybody know whether this would be an efficient way to consume O?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a crack pipe.

				Sounds like it&#039;d be tastey....you don&#039;t need a crackpipe as I remember I use to smoke opium out of my bong with a little weed or hash under it, also just a normal glass pipe worked for me as well with a screen that hash is smoked on.

				I&#039;ve heard that eating/drinking/consuming O is a very good way to get smushed. Then again, I&#039;ve heard shoving it up your ass works real well too. LOL&nbsp; .I&#039;ve only smoked it, and only once at that, although I&#039;m very experienced with opiates in general.&nbsp;

				I saw a recipe somewhere for mixing it with vodka to make homemade laudanum.&nbsp; There were warnings about it being very strong, as in strong enough to OD on, so be careful.

				I had a hell of a time trying to smoke opium. I just couldn&#039;t get the hang of it with my weed paraphernalia, so I ate what I had left and it got me considerably higher than I was able to get by smoking.<br /><br />That being said I believe it is customary to tell someone asking ROA questions to stick it in their rectums. ;D

				Can you post results whenever this goes down? You&#039;ve peaked my attention. Wouldn&#039;t be much just an objective view on: if it worked, compared to smoking (intensity), and if this is now your preferred method now? If you could I&#039;d greatly appreciate the info.

				The internet (even Erowid) is surprisingly void of information on this. I&#039;ll just have to be really careful, I suppose, and start slow. <br /><br />fatbrian: I&#039;m talking about black tar, not actual homemade poppies. There are a lot of &#039;recipes&#039; out there on using x amounts of poppy heads to make tea, but that doesn&#039;t really help me. Vodka and O does sound insane though. <br /><br />Vault: haha thanks, I&#039;ve seen that response quite a few times already :D<br /><br />Discrace: for sure dude. Hopefully I&#039;ll get around to it this weekend. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s not that great if you try to smoke it like weed or hash. Tastes really bad in a joint. Apparently needs to be vaporized for best effect not sure what temp though, opium pipes had a hot coal that sat under the opium to vape it. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t used a weed vape but a soldering iron worked ok. A classic way is to put a little on the end of a unbent paperclip or pin and light it til it&#039;s burning then blow it out, inhale as much as you can, hold it in. Tastes much nicer this way.<br /><br />Also you could just eat it, straight down the hatch. Tastes just like liquorice strangely enough.

				HMMM....Just remember that opiates tend to cause nausea already (believe me, I&#039;ve learned that just a slight change in MG can be the fine line between peace and paradise and a night of wretchedness) <br /><br />So be careful, because if digesting it causes bowel problems already, it can cause a night of hell if you&#039;re not careful. My recommendation is, start small if you have little or no tolerance.<br /><br />Still seems better than smoking it though....I&#039;d do it.
