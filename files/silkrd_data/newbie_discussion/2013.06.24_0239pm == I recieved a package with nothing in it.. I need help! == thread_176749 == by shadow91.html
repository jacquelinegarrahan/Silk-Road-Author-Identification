				I ordered 10 blotters of LSD from OrderOfThePheonix and the package came in, it was wrapped in a stealthy way but there was nothing inside... I&#039;m not sure what I do from here. Do I finalize it or report it somehow? I can take pictures of the packaging but I&#039;m unsure how do show them without giving my myself away.

				Take it from the old hippie ... eat the paper! (blotter paper is treated with liquid LSD), just cut the right size, just hold it on your tongue.

				Yeah, in the few months I&#039;ve been around, I&#039;ve already read quite a few stories about people not finding their things due to heavy stealth... :D especially with blotters!!<br /><br />(Yay, my 100th post! Now I&#039;m karma-enchanted!)

				Much probably is the paper, yes. Usually it is printed from one side and it is perforated to delimit doses size but it happened also to me to get blotter paper without printings in it and no marks. Probably home-made by somebody having crystals.<br />This or you have been scammed, but I wonder why going to all this trouble if this was the case.<br /><br />Just put a piece under your tongue, you will know in no time ;)

				@rock_lobster - That is probably the saddest and most hilarious thing I have ever read. If I didn&#039;t post on here and I didn&#039;t pay so much money for it I would have thought I was scammed and threw it in the trash... I&#039;ve never done a hallucinogenic so I had no idea what it looks like.<br /><br />I will try it today. I need to do a few things before doing so and will report back later today with a trip report.<br /><br />Thanks for helping me out guys!<br /><br />edit: words

				This is what a lot of people call &quot;WoW&quot; blotter (no not World of Warcraft), White on White meaning White LSD crystal on white paper.&nbsp; Seeing as how you didn&#039;t know it was paper one would assume this will be your first time taking acid?&nbsp; Assuming it is legit, prepare yourself for a strong, long lasting substance.&nbsp; Once its &quot;on&quot;, its on for a long time, and much like mushrooms, there is no off switch :P&nbsp; Plan to take it on a period of time of no stress, and in a comfortable environment.&nbsp; After the trip you will have learned something introspectively, whatever it may be, you probably won&#039;t ever forget it.

Most of the times they are easier to spot because there are printings on one side (usually of psychedelic nature) plus the blotter paper is perforated by single hits.<br />However it can happen to have just blotter paper and that&#039;s all as in your case. This happens mostly when the LSD is laced in an home setting, from liquid or crystals. Actually if it is the latter case you can be extremely lucky and have very good LSD.<br /><br />Anyway try it asap so as to know for sure. If there&#039;s some problem the faster you report it (first to the vendor to see what s/he says) the better.

This will be my first time. I plan on doing it within a few hours. I&#039;ve read hundreds of trip reports and it seems that everyone has a life changing or mind altering experience after the trip. <br /><br />I will be very careful though. I plan on listening to music or taking a walk to the local park while tripping to get a sense of nature.
