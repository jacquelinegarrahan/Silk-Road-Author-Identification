				okay so, a while ago not saying any exact time or day, i was waiting to receive an express priority package, ive never ordered it express, ive read a few posts saying its not a great idea. anyway it shows up pretty late considering its expressed, maybe a couple days late,&nbsp; the postal worker shows up way earlier that day (maybe because its an express package?) he has no mail with him, just a pink slip and asks me to sign it, (if theres anything ive learned from reading forums and similar experiences, its to never ever ever sign) so, as much as it hurt to turn down those drugs, had to be done, i said that i no one lives here by that name and were not expecting an order, he looks at me asks again, i said im sure, he says &#039;ok, well get rid of this then&#039; i close the door and go write my vendor a message, i ask wtf why did he have the express package with me having to sign, he says hes sure he marked it for no signing necessary, so he says we can figure this out, two days go by and i ask if any news. he tells me they sent the package back to the address and it was a place with no idea about whatever was in the package. he says this caused him huge problems with relocating and losing alot of money. all because i didnt sign. he was very rude and talking down to me. i dont like that much, i write him a nice 2 page long response, it wasnt nice. at all. well i didnt send it, i dont know why, i just dont like to be mean to people and i understand why hes mad, but to take this out on me i dont feel is right, so i write a shorter message back, saying sorry for this problem and that he should understand why i didnt sign it... im very respectful in this message unlike the one i almost sent. i dont think this guy is bad, he has 100% positive feedback and a decent amount of transactions(not going to say how many or names) he says to just finalize, and get over it, and this is my fault. i dont want to mess up his stats cuz it did get to me, just not the way it should have, id never sign for drugs. well it wasnt a huge amount so i can live with it, life goes on. i just wanted to post this and see some peoples honest opinions if this is my fault or not, i finalized to keep my stats good too, and didnt fuck up his feedback, even though i wanted to for a minute. what would any of you have done? i feel bad that he had to relocate but at the same time this should have never needed to be signed for, and that was his mistake. i dont want problems people on SR i like hanging out reading forums all night, and buying drugs to go trip with friends, this place is perfect, it just kind of bugs me that this guy is being an asshole and blaming me for this. opinions?

				well, we talked for a bit, and even though all this shit happened he apologized and we took care of this, i understand why he would be pissed. i would be too, but it wasnt either of our faults, i wish i knew why usps would want me to sign for a package where a signature was waived, i checked on my state for usps rules and its really relaxed, almost nothing ever has to be signed for, so this seemed odd

				This is only my opinion, but when you decide not to sign for a parcel, you can&#039;t blame the vendor. You are evaluating risks and making what you think is a good decision. Refusing to sign means that you&#039;re not accepting the parcel. How should that be the seller&#039;s problem?

				I wouldn&#039;t order express. And doesn&#039;t sound like it&#039;s really either persons fault. We are dealing in a black market and this isn&#039;t amazon so you can expect that shit will go wrong and to just accept the loss for what it is. What I would have done though is not even answer the door and see if they&#039;d leave the pink slip. And then consider picking it up from the post office.

				the problem here is usps and the USA. Not the vendor. U can read it in countless threads... a vendor never have any problems with signing but in the USA. dutchtradecrew for example. U cant blame the vendor for it. And i cant understand why people would have to be scary signing for a letter or packet... if u sign it or not, it still could be ordered by someone else. How are u supposed to know whats in there? Your sign is proof that u know whats inside? Your sign is proof that its yours? Hell no! Gosh.... I would go to the highest court if needed and i would destroy these guys. ON MY OWN lol<br /><br />So if i want to have somebody locked up, send him some g H and make sure LE getting noticed. Right after he signed he will go to jail? U gotta be kidding me. If thats the case where u live i feel for u!

I can&#039;t imagine how awkward and downright suspicious it would look in the post office to say to the lady behind the counter that &quot;I refuse to sign for THAT package and do not want it any more.&quot; I guarantee that would increase their suspicion by about 1000X.

				My only objection to signing for packages is they always seem to arrive when I am not home. Then I have to drive to the freakin&#039; post office to get it. Other that that it is just like b0m says. I didn&#039;t know what was in there. The guy brings me a package that needs a signature and I sign fer cryin&#039; out loud. Who wouldn&#039;t?
