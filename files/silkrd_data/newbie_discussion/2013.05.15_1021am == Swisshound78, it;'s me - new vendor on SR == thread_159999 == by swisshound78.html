				Hi guys! <br /><br />Let me introduce myself. I&#039;m RC vendor, have been vending RC&#039;s for almost 4 years now, starting from street, then I used to vend on private forums (not under this name, obviously). Now I&#039;m on SR. Why? I wanna make more money guys, and I have products that are here non-existent or my prices are less than 50% of them... <br /><br />I wanted to post in that thread : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159738.0&nbsp; &nbsp;but it turned out that I&#039;m newbie and I&#039;m not allowed until I reach 50 post, that&#039;s alright, so let&#039;s move that thread into this one ;-)<br /><br />... yes yes I can send samples, but I want them to be made as purchase on SR. I offer 100mg 4-aco-dmt or 100mg 25b-nbome - the only things I require is that :<br />- the person who wants sample must have minimum 50 feedback<br />- the person covers the shipping costs of 13 USD<br /><br />I have 7 samples of each product ready to be shipped my friends, so don&#039;t hesitate and PM me - not here, on SR. Thank you a bunch! I will have some feedback at the end of this week and next week I should have 2 or 3 feedback as I&#039;ve made some trade already. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s not a bad idea and rather allowed to post my email&nbsp; and PGP key :<br />swisshound78@riseup.net<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQINBFGEDKMBEACdw3JepLth24Ldt+cwAOouFQiOeNQVBMdu/SJgMT3MZqyWw9iY<br />mcRtqkbye/zR2a6ysZ0sjB6INmM+k8P2D6DPfDwAChp5tzkOyD5MeWeVRPAC+n/P<br />0dJmBscWjgzhu6wfTZ98knEGXQfSDT5Mtm2WyZKYHn5+XJgv17un5IamJpm1TNmB<br />5hF6j+V537PrShselF3hMB3OtEPK2Ka7fKB+KGoCFyV79eq49wobCwUKm6LboMIC<br />YXE8n61+HZtiBnazqX7J4/aEcZKEsi9AxdB54I37qs4VaEi9ScAT8bNmOgVmFuX6<br />Q8hLwr/Xic5kFdqiLKoWmtK8WBhlKkPMuVTv6S7aV0cEM4iQUD432sGPgqtFE7/m<br />x907TqZ8H11Uo5SVoqChNqiAMtNnzB8JFd1/JfQ/Lc3JPJktDWaSMGJh5V//GRMm<br />VI2hKpZl9tJ4IUluruh9p/0O9BKh2MgtWkG6xljBR2vWWa9QUOBl2i07P/uBBNU0<br />KSvDczQAr8cHt5/8EBV0dCei8SepSIno6bD6kHNhCt8Ib/7v2sAuICeS0j+rHv26<br />4gkJHH0PMRuBOpDlJfc7jlcjIQ71rgVPVdkedLd7SvqO8pnbXqbjnmjV5bBKmmPJ<br />zZ4DCLWUhFBi9/Poyzn/FvnzknhJfD23+NqB8mKnVvTbMmDMncngK0Ob3wARAQAB<br />tCZzd2lzc2hvdW5kNzggPHN3aXNzaG91bmQ3OEByaXNldXAubmV0PokCPgQTAQIA<br />KAUCUYQMowIbIwUJCWYBgAYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQzB6v<br />U5HgX4RO3w/+N/4BSulPfaotRsGbVhZPfWZZ51CVuYPxgryEI2OhPQ9MTlVNyY8m<br />66t32lMM0aW6JyRNbjEAAFh08oRSl6mDTn64p/1bqTbXLccMe13fxN4kGnyA7xhX<br />Q+QD03r0qmf4EznwCEStcyOobwWGLVfE91FQmJwt3/ZSuJImkRD2VHPIDXSLE8uO<br />dqs7UW4jtEKnJDRlPLHtqupc1p7PtTu9H/uZQo2OdnMrEJw9EclWwI7Ah3Ue7RFD<br />YjZCP9vmtWvWPna6UFC6T7Lt086Y79wmaNyxKCPESmMKoH7WspBO1jpQYFsVrfm9<br />U9AGM6s8siT2hij0qEYGOVy9eJNQ1vZtzJrEQK7JNJeh7ADzSCYk/oSEAvfd51MW<br />tEbJSCFWCpfvL2mEbHqE2Zte8BxM09iigUvw+bvIo5GOjM1RHAkxmp+m3ybRXn1U<br />Betd28TWPFS8YSGfuZu0TohPxiERmrAAh3p5tw0RWEIedNjxDEl+rJZJXYqDJkul<br />4sW38dpxOSfqX/03KsGKzg+VytXPN0JOc1TIhGzAKbSycqC2aqHWdnYsHuUFdAWH<br />G6BneYCD5g9nO0T1X22z+CG8mqBEEFgCLUbg1wFIHxMm+BA3xbF7ph18MOt7UoSp<br />gGO8bY8psddJ/kD6OXZPOVnEUoCoycB4DlBOGxzye53BNSE3iMPppVm5Ag0EUYQM<br />owEQAOunI18XBYhLkzMcCUI56denkUS5aYwy/TYHkhL9LIj1iuQdnMYD78gHo+CL<br />g4tmC99T3+idIPC9ZfSs1qBGKp8KFFR43J60O6u61giCzsNA3u+5kTMqC9mEXA2q<br />5fhDi83W00cswzpAbcHdJ6cBACYJ+ZrfS3w9rQg90xJXo4Su6XySwb0eNkf6c5Mj<br />OJFVnCQVj9K2cxE8IaJEUxPtlyi0bhDtpngxJdACUa60O03gBuJoOyyWKWoONRPa<br />0/ketcRv2TiY8PpE96FYbOegmM54HEhHWSONy60sYMp70FB2gqLL2VDp1soIBvR9<br />eT/XT910czFGRkWVzK1DXL/ZJLrbvp1vX0lahCNmU+8KvGgHrGVHowkOPYbRMYWJ<br />YrM3z6TKLt89qL9+Ipi/PkWt4B/flAQWQO/JQ5Rsrs7nu2wRxmXI4PLKQRJdXCly<br />4RNEQxNzW7ptamxlyWC0r6n1uSNN9OyPckMRW6XLchE3jNJe3rn9V/sbF7tp0Iqw<br />uOwNIKWOqhYuI7Eia9KvZ/MOj1Ib9m3L/8bfT1ok5TN7WT87+Fp2I9hKY0cnxj/e<br />ppMB9+M6JCLM3tOD4ctbQxz2cxEJ7PLPzIdiYcdrXUaUXvu0SyHPmJ2U48ZgjTE6<br />Vh+6lhTKd74PiQN0lf7e5xG8PYYpywQvZUuA96AS3/tm4WtlABEBAAGJAiUEGAEC<br />AA8FAlGEDKMCGwwFCQlmAYAACgkQzB6vU5HgX4S/zA/+II7pJx0fk/Ep9rosvxm3<br />aNu5RpGm1WfF4TFeM2Rf/lp6DX3zn1zMBcCSQdTr5HS0x25d9dnTlV3AbAaNrD3Q<br />Fl9GgsTHwyPCF55LdXqKWGnGuCOjECDDU3/i1SGSyamRXq1EqWsLnnu7ZOuxxoCW<br />f11rsTCPCBZ6KllLfpHzF9XrcMiVSR65pRRI513dqEfuzaocOYBmjG+PT0bOPdFp<br />s6ooo1NjagL/rr3hCom6JwS7NUFwwxI2exvevAfk4WF51PEAXCmAauJR64cfQxQc<br />+VfG8GUARGcicF43r7gcoFz0fgtYT2eCb4SdO+nyuIyEa/ci2fInNcrlyvrcHTkc<br />9wMqAhNGBb01Ii5fa4lem5MNx/X2WaqZk1XlDWN2oTmZJ+ul6YQG6eev+07+bxFl<br />+1b6/WghvRx4SK/kpEM9CMXLkfgMZXwIj+zjRbVIURnaqlGMRTpBirbFGYDlknX+<br />WC0kSkEltTjlJE78iW5YKXOmnrfziAWx4euPZaDhwxp65Ijihogmq0s+YnGR2ukl<br />54O3dsEJGHr0fvp3wY9iyLe49cR639pGvZvBuV73vKR4uMPxYuDmijrbJWi1urxG<br />i2+QYVIalrGxZ3YEV4QdOXRL6ZBo/VPRF+Xnzd3nOsAOfslECGz2y/z1wkbvWVaT<br />Wzh9y+WnnC0n7fLfMSjupkQ=<br />=hGsA<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				Seems I was the first one to try swisshound&#039;s services. I ordered 0.5g 4-Aco-DMT, and just got the post note to pick up my order. So I&#039;ll go pick it up today at the post office.<br /><br />Will update soon.

				I am in Sweden. So shipping from poland to sweden can be really fast. I have another vendor that can make it here if he post it on a friday, and it will be here on monday. But that is a another vendor.<br /><br />This was sent on a friday or following monday, and arrived here on a thursday. But it was track-able to the vendor. Anyway I think that his shipping times will be okay wherever you live. As long your in the EU at the least. The rest of the world probably takes way longer...<br /><br />I will try the product out later today...<br /><br />( I recieved a bonus on my order as well : 3 x 25i nBOME 500ug )

				So I decided to try out swisshound&#039;s 4-Aco-DMT yesterday. Since it was my first time on that chemical, and I have read stuff that it is quite potent I went with 18mg oral. And I gave my brother 12mg oral as he was going out drinking later on the evening.<br /><br />The taste was not that awful, but a little bitter tryptamean-ish taste. First signs on coming up came rather fast at around 20-30mins but it did feel a little sleepy. At one hour I could see the resemblance to mushrooms, but not as intense and not quite the same chaos in my mind. Nicer and slower in a way.<br />I laughed a lot, played some uncharted 3 during the peak and it got more intense than I wanted, so I had to pause the game and soon after I had to run to the toilet and vomit... typical mushroom effect for me as I vomit on mushrooms 80% of the time.<br /><br />Soon after my toilet visit the peak subsided and down to baseline took a couple of more hours where I felt normal until I started to talk to phone with my brother and I realised he and I was still fucked up.<br /><br />It was a nice experience and a mellow dosage though I vomited and felt a little panic whilst playing PS3. Next time will be 20-25mg.<br /><br />6025: I&#039;d like to hear your opinions on this tryptamine once you get it.&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />Have fun everyone!!! Peace

				1) His packaging is bad (see his feedback)<br />2) He doesn&#039;t vacuum seal (see his feedback)<br />3) He posts with signature required, thereby exposing customers to possible controlled deliveries in countries where his products are illegal (such as the UK)<br />4) He requires FE, despite being a new vendor with only 10 transactions<br /><br />1&amp;2) I&#039;m working on it, I&#039;m new to SR<br />3) You can usually tell from tracking if something fishy is going on, but I ship registered only because I always want to have proof I&#039;ve send the stuff. This prevents reverse scam and makes me feel sleep better.<br />4)what I wrote was &quot; if you have no buyer feedback I will ask you to finalize early, if you don&#039;t like it just don&#039;t order. &quot;. Means 0 feedback. Well I suppose this is pretty understandable isn&#039;t it? I can&#039;t check feedback before you order (if I can just please tell me how) and I don&#039;t want to make business with possible reverse scammers that just created account. Just it.<br /><br />Sorry for being rude, didn&#039;t mean that, I just had a bad day.<br /><br />Since you wrote that I&#039;m a poor seller my positive feedback has doubled : <br /><br />has been a vendor for 22 days<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 73% of sellers with 100% positive feedback from 10 transactions<br />has 15 fans <br /><br />Also I&#039;ve thrown 20g of 4acodmt 120 USD each, it&#039;s promo price

				damn, $120 is a good deal.&nbsp; still waiting for my first order, but I think I will have to jump on that if there are any left after I check out your stuff.&nbsp; what&#039;s the shelf life of 4aco if stored properly??&nbsp; and you&#039;re making the correct choice not dealing w/people w/zero feedback--a lot of them will be out to scam, sadly.

				sample finally got here! took just 2 weeks which seems long for registered mail but not too bad.<br /><br />shipping and packaging 3.5/5 (not so stealthy for an international shipper, ok though. i did NOT have to sign for it and I was expecting to--not sure whose mistake it was, but I was happy that I didn&#039;t have to)<br /><br />communication 2/5 (didn&#039;t answer my email to let me know if it had gotten through customs, saw that it had been read within a day, but never heard back), <br /><br />product seems like 5/5 (will update)<br /><br />&nbsp;honestly would have left a 4/5 but he&#039;s a new vendor so I&#039;m being generous and it was only a cheap sample so I gave a 5/5. room for improvement though.

				Just received 1g 4-Aco-DMT from Swisshound78 at an excellent promo price - saved me about £45 compared to other vendors&nbsp; ;D Also included was a very welcome free sample of tabs! Only slight problem is despite me requesting the sample I can&#039;t remember what it is&nbsp; ::) Pretty sure it&#039;s either Metocin, miprocin or moxie... hopefully Swisshound will enlighten me!<br />Needless to say, Highly Recommended (perfectly adequate packaging, took just under week to UK).

				Have tried swisshound78&#039;s 4-aco-dmt now two times, tried 4-aco-dmt before once from seller uhrwerk, which was an amazing experience, with taking only about 15mg. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong, but swisshound78&#039;s 4-aco-dmt seems much inferior. <br /><br />Two weeks ago we made gel tabs from it, a bit more than 20 tabs from around 230miligramms, so around 10mg per tab. Taking it had very little effect, even after taking as many as 4-5 tabs per person (taking two tabs to start and redosing for more, after about 30-45 minutes, as it had little effect). Some feeling, but no visuals. We were worried, that we might have damaged the product in the cooking process. <br /><br />Today, two weeks after first try, I have retried it alone. I don&#039;t have a measuring scale atm, but from the eye,&nbsp; I probably took more than 50mg, even snorted some, this was about two hours and 30 minutes ago. There is some disorientation and feeling of the product, perhaps some visuals, but very weak. <br /><br />Is there something wrong with the product, can anyone else confirm this from their experience?<br /><br />I will retry in a few weeks, after I get a measuring scale and report back.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				@Devaney1984 : I didn&#039;t send wrong product in terms I made mistake : I restocked 4aco, and my supplier screwed me and sent magnesium oxide instead of proper stuff. Issue is fixed, I am sorry for that but it was not my fault actually. My source has always been reliable and I trusted it ultimately. It was by no means active substance. <br /><br />Well, I&#039;m not making excuses, I just got misled by trusting my source too much. After sending two or three orders I realised something&#039;s wrong with the appearance and checked that.. <br /><br />

				Got it the other day, tried same night.<br />swisshound&#039;s 4aco-dmt is the BEST!<br />Amazing trip on very small amount.<br /><br />Trip is extremely easy compared to mushrooms or LSD. Feels very natural and smooth.<br />Very similar to ayuhuasca, in terms of quality and duration, minus the nausea.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to order from swiss!
