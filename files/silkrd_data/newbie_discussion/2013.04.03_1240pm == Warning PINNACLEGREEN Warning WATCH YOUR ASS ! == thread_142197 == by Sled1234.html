				SLED1234, vendors often have cash flow issues, especially when they have many orders in transit and buyers who fail to finalize.<br /><br />The fact that the vendor kept you informed of the delay says a lot about the vendor.&nbsp; If you did not FE then you should not be concerned about being scammed.<br />This is SR and not Amazon, so be cool !!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Chances are your item will be shipped soon and may even come with a bonus for the delay ...

				Yeah it seems good he was honest. He went to the Post office with $400 in cash, which was still not enough to get them all out. <br />Seems totally reasonable.&nbsp; Plus he has had great communication with me, and very nice. <br /><br />Also great reviews popping up on his page! will be ordering soon to test out.

				This vendor messaged me saying that he could not get my order out as he has no product, yet his listings are still up. He has only three transactions, and has been here less than two weeks. He just canceled my order, but I was expecting the worse as he messaged me about having no product without canceling it first, like any other vendor would do. I lost about two hundred dollars due to this asshole. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR.&nbsp; &nbsp;
