				I know I&#039;m not going to seem very hardcore asking this, but can we still get DMAA (1,3-dimethylamylamine).<br /><br />It was pretty sweet to use as a pre-workout in the gym. Pretty mild etc.<br /><br />Anything else good otherwise?

				I guess it helps in addition to caffeine. Plus those energy drinks are mainly sugar + caffeine, and I want to avoid the sugar.

				Go to Walgreens and pick up some Bronkaid tablets or Primatine Mist tablets.&nbsp; &nbsp;The active ingredient is Ephedrine, and that should do you fine.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)

				No Walgreens here, not in the States ;)<br /><br />Will have a look for a similar item with the same active ingredient though, cheers.

The sale/possession is in the same class as heroin, MDMA, etc.<br /><br />The guy at the vitamin shop here was telling me they originally had DMAA tablets (he would go clubbing on them). Has anyone seen these in the vitamin shops in the US?

				They could very likely have the DMAA vitamin bombs here in the &quot;dietary supplement&quot; shops in the US....although I see it most often in a powder milk shake drink with 10 million other amino acids, muscle builders, etc. etc......<br /><br />Oh, and&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had DMAA before mixed in with other ingredients&nbsp; in a pre-workout energy-protein beverage.&nbsp; So that was probably unfair of me to dismiss it out of hand so readily.&nbsp; But I also have friends who know it pretty well, and it&#039;s just another option for them along the lines of ephedrine or Jack3D....etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck with your search, and I&#039;ll see if it&#039;s still on the shelves in my neck of the woods.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)
