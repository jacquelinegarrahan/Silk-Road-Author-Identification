				I am going to spend a few days on the forums before I decide to get my feet wet. I can see there is a lot to learn. I am so grateful for a site like this. I am a huge fan of psychedelics. Not that I do them so much anymore, but it&#039;s always nice to be able to when I need a new perspective on things. I believe in the power of a collective consciousness. I hope we can help influence an awakening so that more people will see what a sham this war on drugs is. The pharmaceutical and alcohol companies want control at any cost, and the government is their paid enforcer. There are so many laws that have all to do with protecting special interests and nothing to do with protecting people. One of the best videos exposing such corruption can be found on YouTube. Search &quot;Cancer The Forbidden Cures.&quot; It&#039;s a 92 minute documentary on our health system. The sad thing is that this documentary is just one example, the tip of the iceberg. But it&#039;s a good place to begin. Meanwhile, I&#039;m just happy a friend lead me here. I love the idea of freedom from the abuse of authority. I hope we can influence an awakening. We need to take back control of our government. Before it gets even worse than it already is. Peace.

				my short hand to say you need to try and make the trail back to you more difficult<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br /><br />options here are things like Easywallet and blockchain online wallet<br />they both have a lot of coins coming in and out, if you change you amounts about say pay in larger amount tthen spit it out in smaller bits (also the .003 fee is coming off) then it just makes it more of a pain to trace by which ever agent gets hold of the transaction logs for each step of the process.<br /><br />bitcoinfog is a more robust laudering shop, but you only get teh full benefit if you are patient and leave your coins in there for a few days and again split and send.
