				Quick query before I add any BTC to my account: is it possible to link my personal wallet to SR via transaction history in the block chain? Should I delete a wallet after I use it to send funds to SR? I&#039;m not 100% sure how it works. . . .

				there a service that for a small fee will mix your coins with other peoples and then split them all up again making them pretty much untraceable. Its called bitfog and you can access it through tor on the link below:<br /><br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion

				Whenever i have asked this question the reply&#039;s have all been use Bitfog or pay in cash to obtain the coin initially. Where i live we cannot pay in cash, the exchanges available all have high fee&#039;s and then to top it off once you finally have your coin you must wash it through Bitfog for a further fee.I think it would be great if someone with a bit more knowledge on this subject could explain how Bitcoin payments can be tracked i think the more we learn about this subject the more we can protect ourselves from this happening and at the same time hopefully find a way to pay less fees.

				I&#039;ve also heard of bitlaundry, anybody use both and have a reason they prefer one over the other?<br /><br /><br />If you want to see how easy it is to track bitcoins, copy one of your used wallet addresses and search on blockexplorer. If you sent it directly to an address somehow known to be associated with illicit activity, your address would be tainted. The problem is whether or not there&#039;s anything linking that wallet address to you.<br /><br />Turns out that&#039;s the same address you used to withdraw BTC from Mt Gox? And you gave them your personal info? Nuh-uh, not good. Hence the transaction mixers. I would use a mixer for incoming and outgoing transactions for anything questionable and anything linked to my personal info. <br />

I have also just changed the way i purchase bitcoins and now use a method that involves making a deposit into a bank account in which i don&#039;t have to give any of my details so it would be hard to link them back to me even if followed!

				Unless you&#039;re a seller, and moving lots of product at that, I wouldn&#039;t see too much reason for the paranoia.<br /><br />I fund Mt. Gox through wire transfer then send that to a wallet on a work computer then send it to SR wallet from there. I only make small purchases, use real name and address and I&#039;ve never had a problem...at least not yet.<br />
