				I just noticed this: see http://i.imgur.com/O3lMvdA.png . The item in the pic is 4TheeLow&#039;s suboxone. I expected to buy the item for the listed price and transferred exactly that amount of BTC, but it looks like there&#039;s a markup before it calculates the subtotal. I didn&#039;t notice that before, maybe it&#039;s something new. Just trying to notify others because I didn&#039;t know and now I have to wait an hour and pay&nbsp; transaction fees to transfer more BTC. Perhaps that could be made more clear in the shopping cart? + 0.01 tax instead of just an unexplained increase.

				i thought i read somewhere that there is a commission charged, and vendors can either list the prices inclusive of the commission or add it on top at the checkout or something like that. not 100% sure tho.

				Are you sure that&#039;s what is happening and it isn&#039;t just a consequence of the BTC rate dropping recently?

Only way I see this could be the explanation is if SR checked the value of BTC for each price on the page separately, and the price fell in between the two calculations. That seems really inefficient though, imagine 20 network requests for a vendor page listing 20 products - if I were making a site I would get the price once for each page and just use that.

As amounts less than ฿0.00 don&#039;t show up in prices displayed in the shopping cart, it is highly likely that the vendor in question is charging ฿0.009 or thereabouts for shipping, or else the combination of what he is charging for shipping and the item itself (not ฿0.14, but ฿0.14542438 etc.) is bringing the total up to ฿0.15.<br /><br />Silk Road has no need to implement an &quot;invisible sales tax&quot;, and DPR is entirely upfront about ALL fees.<br /><br />Libertas
