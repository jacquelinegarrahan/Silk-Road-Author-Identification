				There appear to be (at least) two quite different packaging designs under the same brand name, apparently from two different manufacturers: www.eztest.com and www.eztestkits.com.<br /><br />Is one &#039;official&#039; and the other a ripoff?

				Looks like location based to me.&nbsp; EzTest is located in the US and EzTestKits is in the UK.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dancesafe.org also sells a test kit which is cheaper because it&#039;s not individual tests it&#039;s reagents in multiple vials, but it doesn&#039;t test for all types of drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Okay.&nbsp; I am curious to see how well these reagent tests compare against GC-MS analysis, which I am conducting on some samples this weekend.&nbsp; Will report back with results.<br /><br />Incidentally, are there any concerns with revealing one&#039;s true identity to such online vendors?&nbsp; Might LE monitor their sales to flag suspect names/addresses for further examination?

				It would be interesting to see those results...<br /><br />For identifying yourself to a vendor i think responses will be mixed.&nbsp; Chances are some users are using their real name and address because they don&#039;t want to add mail fraud to the list of charges if they get caught, some users use fake identities, some users are using drop houses.&nbsp; So as far as answering your question no i don&#039;t think you should be concerned especially with reputable vendors because they delete all evidence that the sent a package after it arrives or they say the do.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />You might also not want to tell them that you doing a GC-MS analysis cause they could intentionally skew the results.&nbsp; They could send you a higher quality sample then they would send anyone else because they know you are testing it.<br /><br />One person to talk to is PineappleLove.&nbsp; She/He is doing testing on Cocaine samples for purity.

				Re vendor identification: I was referring to clearnet sites like eztest.com, rather than SR vendors.&nbsp; Even if one used a drop-box, one would have to pay through conventional means, so identity would be exposed; for that reason, I thought it would be best to use a real address rather than additionally expose a drop-box?<br /><br />As for informing vendors, I shall be telling them that I conduct GC-MS analysis (but I also purchase through another/anonymous account to a different delivery address and compare the results).<br /><br />I&#039;m aware of (and have tremendous respect for) PineappleLove&#039;s work, which I believe uses the Dutch public testing labs.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about ordering the test kits either.&nbsp; Back in 90&#039;s when the rave scene was big Dancesafe used to have pill testing booths at raves for user safety.&nbsp; LE in the US couldn&#039;t do anything about it. <br /><br />It&#039;s not illegal to own a test kit.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure if someone was being prosecuted by LE after being busted with drugs that could request the records from Dancesafe or Eztest to tighten the noose.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve ordered them...&nbsp; LE isn&#039;t beating down my door, yet.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I probably wouldn&#039;t tell them that you are testing the validity of their product using silk road drugs and a Mass Spec ;D<br />
