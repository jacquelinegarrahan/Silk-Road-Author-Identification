				Some questions:<br /><br />1. Have you had success receiving orders from overseas vendors?<br /><br />2. What is the average time elapsed from purchase to receipt of package?<br /><br />3. What kind of products and what amounts were successfully received?<br /><br />4. If delivery was unsuccessful what problems did you encounter (LE investigation, seizure, etc)?<br /><br />I&#039;m considering making large(r) purchases from O/S vendors as there are more products available and the prices are much cheaper.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I am new to SR and in my opinion it is A great tool for personal supply of drugs for the street buyer. But if you are trying to buy larger amounts to re selll then you are bound to get caught. But that&#039;s just my HO. <br /><br /><br />Plus try reading vendors review threads and such and avoid anything from the Netherlands or Europe in general for big orders as that area is world renowned for drugs

				I know this isn&#039;t really answering your question but Australia is notoriously tough on drugs brought in from overseas

				In a nutshell you probably have a 50/50 chance getting it through, between customs seizing it and the vendor not even sending. More likely is seizure. If its a large amount then yes, LE will be interested in investigation. If you are ordering multiple package to your own home, or even one large one and they are egtting seized then you are fucked.<br /><br />Research the site<br /><br />Research the forums<br /><br />And remember, LE are all over this forum, so careful what you say and ask.

When I say a &quot;large&quot; purchase I don&#039;t mean thousands of oxycodone or ecstasy for example. Just a hundred or two so I have a lengthy personal supply of whatever I&#039;m currently craving :) I don&#039;t resell, I just prefer having a consistent supply on hand because unfortunately I&#039;m a bit of an addict to my poisons and hate thinking about running low/out. Plus it generally works out cheaper per unit when buying &quot;bulk&quot;. And if LE are interested in a depraved addict buying a hundred valium for their personal stash then I guess we should be happy because there must not be any real crime (robbery, assault, murder, etc) needing attention.<br /><br />I figured this place would be crawling with LE, but I trust the anonymity of TOR and SR and figure we&#039;re all untraceable. But I do wonder how we can be sure that LE isn&#039;t posing as a vendor?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read the wiki and a few threads on these forums, anything you recommend in particular?<br /><br />Regarding your comment about large or multiple packages being ordered to one&#039;s home resulting in them being fucked. Assuming the package(s) had been ordered through SR and the recipient does not sign how would LE prove the person whose address said package(s) were sent to did in fact make the order?

				Before considering all those things, you need to work out which vendors are actually going to send the drugs you have purchased.<br /><br />Most of the vendors primarily sell to countries in the EU, and their stats are buffed by the positive reviews from European buyers. Without proof, but with anecdotal and personal evidence, I think a few of the leading European vendors do not send every order they get from Australia, but only send a fraction. Their stats take a hit, but the hit is overwhelmed by the positive from Europe.<br /><br />I think that a lot of people assume that their drugs were taken by customs, when the drugs were not sent in the first place. For example, I ordered in a large quantity to my address. The amount I ordered, on 2 occasions from 2 different vendors around the same time was such a large amount that it certainly would have warranted investigation by the Australian Federal Police. At the very least it would have meant a knock on the door, or an order for Australia Post to withhold my mail for inspection by the AFP. None of those things have happened, and I have continued to receive drugs.

				Wow. You order straight to your home address? I don&#039;t think I&#039;m courageous enough to do this.<br /><br />Truth be told the type of product and amounts I&#039;m talking about are your standard run of the mill prescriptions (xanax, oxycodone, and valium - depending on my current addiction phase) in the 100-200 range. It just means I have about 4 weeks worth and at a somewhat decent price. If LE want to spend resources toward this, then I wish I had more say in where my tax dollars went! lol<br /><br />I think your assumption might be right, but it&#039;s too hard to know for certain. There are more obstacles the package needs to pass to make it to you which makes it reasonable to believe it was seized at some point, but it&#039;s just as easy for the vendor to say they sent it when they never did.

				I&#039;ve had 100% success rate with 5 different O/S orders of both pills and powders.(30 pills and 5 grams of powder were the biggest orders)<br />Shipping times can be annoying but I&#039;m fairly confident in the vendors I use and also fairly confident in the ineptitude of Australia&#039;s customs.
