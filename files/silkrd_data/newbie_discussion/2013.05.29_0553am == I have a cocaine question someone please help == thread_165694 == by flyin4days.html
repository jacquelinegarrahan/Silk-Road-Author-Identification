				ok if I could I would post my question in this thread:<br /><br />Independent Cocaine Lab Test Results<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.600<br /><br /><br />my question is this: I see that there is 87% pure coke out there and 89% pure coke ect (I think I read 89% is the highest possible) anyways I see people advertising acetone washer coke- what is the purity of that stuff and wouldnt it be just as good as the 89%?<br /><br />I registered just to ask this although I have made a dozen or so purchases on the road<br /><br />just want to say I normally just read through the forums and take in the plethera of info but I didnt see this question asked <br />

				Acetone wash will only remove certain impurities in the cocaine. Certain cutting agents, like levamisole (and I think amphetamine, but not 100%) will not be removed from an acetone wash. <br /><br />The 89% cocaine should (theoretically) be free of all cutting agents and impurities.

				as said above acetone only removes some impurities but not amphetamine.<br /><br />there is also a chloroform wash and an ether (alcohol) wash - this clears out all the other shit. after triple washing with all 3 in theory you should be left with pharmaceutical grade cocaine. which is awesome by the way - TetraVort sold it here, he washed it himself, and it is nothing like any coke you&#039;ve ever done in your life, it&#039;s just soooo good<br /><br />89% is maximum purity for cocaine HCL (the powder/salt you snort), the other 11% is hydrochloride. 100% pure cocaine is freebase

				You can see if there is Amph in it by dropping it in bleach, it&#039;ll turn orange and the blow will sink to the bottom.

				How can lines be more wasteful? I dont see the logic in this. If it deliveries to cocaine into your nose then it successfully delivered all the coke without loosing any in the process, right? I&#039;m fairly a naive cocaine user so im probably wrong but someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong/

				It seems that after a few, they start to have a point of diminishing returns.&nbsp; Also, I notice stuff falling out of my nose, and I am sure I lose some when I end up using a kleenex to blow and get ready for the next round.&nbsp;

				Damn didnt t think I would get that much response and good knowledge. Im curious now about dropping a line or two into bleach, and seeing whats in mys tuff<br /><br />I&#039;ve been so hesitant on buying C on SR because of that review thread with the lab results now I just want the real deal THE PURE FIRE!<br /><br />and why doesn&#039;t somebody sell tripple washed stuff on here?<br /><br />I also agree coke in my area is average 60/g on here 120/g

				just two more quick questions guys and gals<br />1.when you add your C into a clear glass of bleach and it nothing turns orange there is no amphetamine. -Is that statement correct?<br />2. On average me and a buddy can split a g in a night (we are heavy drinkers and party pretty hard, how much would the real deal 89% or washed stuff need to be used?<br />peace

Man, I haven&#039;t touched a blade since I discovered using screens. I use a small culinary screen, like 3 bucks at wal mart, I think they are used for sifting sugars, flour, spices, etc. <br />It&#039;s bowl shaped, bout 3 inches diameter with a handle and it&#039;s metal screen. Just drop your C in there, rub it in with finger, and presto, instant , perfectly fine pile o coke in like 4 seconds. You can&#039;t beat it, it&#039;s just way easy and effective.
