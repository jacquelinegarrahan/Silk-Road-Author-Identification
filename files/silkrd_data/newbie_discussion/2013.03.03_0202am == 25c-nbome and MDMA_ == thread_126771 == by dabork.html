				Me and my girlfriend are planning to drop some 25c-nbome on Tuesday.&nbsp; Most likely 800ug a piece.&nbsp; We also just came into the possession of some pretty good MDMA.&nbsp; I was curious what it might be like to mix the two.&nbsp; Roughly 800ug of 25c with 0.2g of MDMA.&nbsp; I feel like it could be pleasant, but I also have never taken 25c.&nbsp; We have both done 25i and it was good as far as visuals and fun, but had a bit too much body load for me, and really messed with my sinuses.&nbsp; I had heard these effects were lessened on 25c, which is why I decided to give it a try.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on this mix?&nbsp; &nbsp;It may be smarter to try the 25c first alone and see how it effects us before we mix it with things, but I&#039;m open to suggestions.&nbsp; Has anyone tried this or something similar?&nbsp; How was it? How much did you mix of both? <br /><br />All input welcome.

				This seems WAY too dangerous, I&#039;m already not a fan of the 25x NBOME series but I&#039;ve had 25c on 2 occasions. The things it does to your blood pressure and heart are already bad, then add to that the strain MDMA puts on the same organs. This just seems like a recipe for a trip to the hospital if not morgue. I would seriously avoid such a combo.
