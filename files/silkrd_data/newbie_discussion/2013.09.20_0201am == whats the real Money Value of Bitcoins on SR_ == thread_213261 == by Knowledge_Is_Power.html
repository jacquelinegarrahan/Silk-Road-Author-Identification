				I&#039;m new too here but one thing you can do is change your settings to display everything in USD (or whatever your currency may be) rather than BTC. Also if you scroll to the very bottom of SR it has the current rate in the left hand corner.

				Not where they get the value from (definitely favors the vendors, which is understandable),&nbsp; but it shows 130BTC=1 USD, I was lucky enough to get some for a little less than that a few days ago, but for the most part, localbitcoin, mt gox etc are all selling for 140 +,&nbsp; if only the purchasing of bitcoins could be made easier, this whole process would be a lot less stressful (see other posts, most of the risk getting scammed is in buying bitcoins, not buying here, isn&#039;t that ironic.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as soon as bitcoins are made easier to buy (read government intervention by regulation) I can guarantee you the anonymity goes away.

Yeah, we all hate the hoops you have to jump through but it&#039;s like that for a reason. If you could just go to bitcoin.com and buy BTC with a credit card or mosey on up to Wal-Mart and fund your account like PayPal, you might as well go ahead and handcuff yourself.

				Which is kind of what I was getting at with the govt. regulation thing, but Bitcoins are not completely anonymous, it is possible to track where a coin goes and to make fairly educated guesses where they end up.&nbsp; And buying them is not illegal so it should be easy to buy.&nbsp; The trick is to move the BTC around once you get them if you are trying to be sly.&nbsp; After all look at that last big BTC heist, they can actually see that the money has not moved yet, but they do know where it is in the digital world.

				Look at bitstamp.net campbx.com or btc-e.com<br /><br />The value is always a little higher than thee exchanges.
