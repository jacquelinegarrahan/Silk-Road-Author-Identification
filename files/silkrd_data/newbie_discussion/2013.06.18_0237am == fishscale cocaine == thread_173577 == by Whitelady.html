				That sucks man, which vendor?&nbsp; No, it shouldn&#039;t burn, pure blow doesn&#039;t cause your sinuses any irritation and is easily flushed out by your mucus.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t have battlescars on your nose the next day even if you did a lot.&nbsp; I&#039;m not too knowledgeable on which substances are used to cut, but I heard levamisol is really hard on your sinuses. <br /><br />I ordered from MeGrimlock in Canada for the first time to try him out, as I&#039;m on a quest to find a reliable source of good shit which is fucking rare when it comes to blow.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best I&#039;ve ever had, no burning or anything like that.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the newbie bin trying to rack up 50 posts so I can leave him a rave review.&nbsp;

				I got off mrouid once, I remember that night vividly...I actually didn&#039;t mind his product, it was strong as fuck, I hooked up my whole office for the xmas party and everyone was just flying...might be cut with an upper.&nbsp; <br /><br />MeGrimlock&#039;s is definitely better.

I&#039;ll place an order when I get more BTC.<br /><br />OP - I&#039;ve ordered from the same vendor, though I didn&#039;t snort any of mine. The quality was OK, but I suspect it&#039;s cut with something, as there was stuff left after I cooked up a batch. Sorry i can&#039;t be more help.
