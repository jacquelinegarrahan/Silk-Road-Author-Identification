				I personally don&#039;t think specific practices should be discussed on the forums, due to the fact that they&#039;re read by anyone.<br />You don&#039;t want to tell the customs agent where to look do you =P<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m also curious

				Not much needs to be revealed to set out guidelines.<br /><br />Firstly, Domestic: I don&#039;t think there is one vendor here that doesn&#039;t ship within their country. From my history of ordering 80+ packages from many vendors, I feel that some do a great job with disguising products as legal products of different types just shipping domestic (some of these methods clearly cost up to $10, esp. for large orders)! For me, If I&#039;m ordering within Canada (where I am from) All I ask is to receive a discreetly labeled package with no odour coming off the package prior to opening it myself.<br /><br />Internationally, There is no &quot;perfect solution&quot; but disguising products can work, and often allow a package to be opened at customs and still delivered without suspicion. If you want to avoid customs as much as possible, flat-pack. With crystalline compounds and powders, but the order in a bag or other containment vessel that spans a good portion of the exterior packaging (IE: a half ounce of ketamine or MDMA can be crushed down to fit between a greeting card with a thickness of 1-2mm when measuring the internal packaging. Sandwich the product between two pieces of non-corrugated cardboard, such as those from greeting cards. Tape the product to the cardboard to ensure that clumping, and uneven surface area distribution occurs at a minimum when in transit. Don&#039;t forget the Triple-Vacuum Seal any products that are known to be tested for. This also works to prevent product from settling or feeling like a powder at all!à¸¿0.00

				The most interesting stealth I&#039;ve ever seen wasn&#039;t even a silk road seller, this was in the cold, dark days of 2009, a friend me some speed that he bagged, heat sealed, then printed a mock 2-page letter from a major high-street bank, stuck the heat-seal bag inside the letter, then placed it in one of those envelopes with the clear header so the logo can be seen&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Probably not particularly effective now that I come to think of it but it seemed to have been working for him up to that point. Nobody suspects the bank letter&nbsp; ;)

				You&nbsp; could flat pack quite a bit of powder disguised as documents if you take the time to develop a method. For large orders tho, I think that a better stealth package should be well hidden in a package that contains 95% filler product. There are many ways to hid the last 5%, so that&#039;s something bulk vendors should decide on and develop in turn.

				Vac sealed is a must for a shipping method to even be considered stealthy.&nbsp; But vac sealed doesn&#039;t make it stealthy, just helps contain the smell and condenses the size a bit.&nbsp; There need to be multiple barriers to seeing what&#039;s inside.&nbsp; If the box happens to tear, don&#039;t want it falling out or some postman being able to look inside and see drugs.&nbsp; Other than that, there&#039;s a lot of room for creativity.

				Depends on whether the item is high risk or not. I&#039;ve generally seen good stealth for the item, but for one high risk item I ordered the packaging was complete shit. Needless to say, I won&#039;t be ordering from that vendor again!

				Stealth shipping = Drugs concealed inside an &#039;ordinary&#039; looking package. <br /><br />That, is really all you need to know.<br />Every vendor works hard to make sure that their goods are well hidden. As far as specific techniques go, I&#039;d be very surprised if anyone was daft enough to reveal such info. <br /><br />A handful of pills dropped into a jiffy bag, this is not stealth.<br /><br />Pills stitched into the spine of a book, for example, is a exercise in stealth.<br /><br />Domestic orders aren&#039;t subject to the rigours of customs (in the uk at least), so MEGA stealth isn&#039;t really as important as if say, you were ordering 2oz of weed from an international seller.<br /><br /><br />In terms of stealth, out of all the domestic packages I&#039;ve received, some were pretty good concealments. Some were less than perfect, and one was downright genius.<br /><br />To sum up: Stealth = vendor will do their best to conceal your treats.

				I do agree that when you stick with domestic orders, stealth is less important.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t go as far as to say it doesn&#039;t matter, but domestic packages are nowhere near as scrutinized as anything international.&nbsp; Customs looks a lot more closely than your local postman.

				I&#039;m sure they have been seized at some point, but no particular circumstances come to mind.&nbsp; Seems it&#039;d be very easy to make edibles stealth.&nbsp; They&#039;re sort of stealthy in and of themselves.&nbsp; Put a few weed cookies in with some regular cookies and nobody will ever know the difference.<br /><br />I could go for some edibles right now...&nbsp; Thinking of ordering some cheeba chews.

				The first time, I was almost jumping up and down with excitement.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t believe I actually had great quality drugs delivered to my mailbox.&nbsp; Still to this day some of the best LSD I&#039;ve ever done.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even find halfway decent LSD locally and one online source completely opened up my eyes to what&#039;s out there.&nbsp; Shame he&#039;s gone.&nbsp; Frank is sitting somewhere in a prison cell for a while.

				Yes mentioning specific methods for making a package stealthy is a no-no.&nbsp; We don&#039;t want to alert LEOs to what they should be looking for.&nbsp; However, there are some things that create stealth that are mostly common knowledge and it doesn&#039;t hurt to mention, such as vac sealing, creating multiple layers of barriers, etc.

				I&#039;d prefer that if someone else opened it, they would have no cause to dig deeper and if they did, they still might not figure it out.&nbsp; That&#039;s the best stealth.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had venders with medium and high stealth, but luckily due to good forum reading I&#039;ve avoided any venders with low stealth.&nbsp; So far, at least.

				Speaking as someone who, until last week, had never made use of SR, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect when vendors talked about stealth. Nonetheless, I was very pleasantly surprised at how unassuming my delivery turned out to be. The contents, of course, will be another story :)<br /><br />p.s. hello y&#039;all
