				Hey y&#039;all.<br /><br />If you know anyone in college chemistry this can be obtained for free. Or you can google and buy one for $15-$20. What is this great way to vape DMT?<br /><br />This... http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLqIOiMVEDE1tXvJelohDz5_tLuFWkYWKT0fcp2ZaTTCHDv0bv<br /><br />A PYREX FILTERING FLASK<br /><br />The glass is thick. You have to heat it for a hot minute to get the DMT to vape. Using a torch lighter (http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_131177_1.jpg) which only costs $10-$20 is best and leaves no black scorching like a Bic lighter does.<br /><br />Drop you DMT into the top of the flask, trying to get it all in the same area. Then, heat the glass. Use the &quot;filtering attachment&quot; as a carb and the top as a mouthpiece. As I said, the glass takes a second to heat as it&#039;s thick (my filtering flask has a lip that&#039;s 1/4&quot; thick and the bottom is likely 1/8&quot; thick); so you don&#039;t have to worry about burning your lips.<br /><br />I am going to see if you can place the flask on a stove-top, heat it, drop in 10mgs of DMT, hit it, and repeat until you blast off next batch of DMT I get.<br /><br />My best-friend and I were able to blast off twice each using only 55mgs of Ringo&#039;s DMT yesterday (supplemented with nitrous... mmmmm). The flask lets you take the equivalent of resin hits as it stores and just heats the DMT enough to vaporize it.<br /><br />Hope this helps my fellow cosmonauts. Maybe we will meet &quot;playing death&quot; in some other dimension sometime....?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />the.grey.fox &amp; the.red.fox

				That is brilliant!&nbsp; We always recommend a machine or meth pipe, but that sounds perfect!&nbsp; I think the only method more efficient would be a vaporizer with adjustable heat.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />~ST

				Using 55mgs (I have a scale) of Ringo&#039;s DMT, my co-pilot and I blasted off three times each using the filtering flask. We threw some nitrous in too (and were on 25c-NBOMe for the first two). It is awesome. The DMT is all gone now... so I&#039;ll try the whole stove thing and it you can heat the bottom while keeping the top cool enough to put your lips on and to hold the carb.<br /><br />A good Vaporizer is expensive. The &quot;Machine&quot; seemed so complicated to make to me. Foil is a waste, major (how I always did my DMT in the past though, oddly enough). The filtering flask is either free for students (hell, even someone near a college who looks young enough to walk onto campus... or I bet a Craigslist ad asking if any chem students had one to sell for $10 would result in a score). Or, for those who believe that theft of any kind (I only view theft from individuals, who I know or not, or from &quot;mom&amp;pop businesses&quot; as a karmic drain) bad karma... the cost is cheap.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to get more of Ringo&#039;s stuff. My friend (not my girl yet... but soon :D ) and I are ordering some today and then she wants to try Acid or another tryptamine/phenatylamine/arylcyclohexamine. I am so glad to have a co-pilot to explore these other realities/dimensions with.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				When you vape you cant take in the whole dosage, you waste it that way.

				Very cool idea Foxx!&nbsp; I like the way you think.&nbsp; That nitrous idea is good too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even have to do it to know that DMT and nitrous go together like peaches and cream.&nbsp; You sir, are both a gentlemen and a scholar.&nbsp; I&#039;m real interested in hearing about your combos.&nbsp; Somewhere in there has to be the key to utopia.&nbsp; You are doing a service to us all.

				If a person were to go to a college or a university, or rather were to be on campus (but not a student), how would they easily obtain one of these flask? Can you buy them on campus? Should you steal one?

				I was told to pack a bowl with weed at the bottom the DMT in the middle and more weed on top. then you light the weed (make sure it&#039;s only lighting the bud) and let it cherry for a bit. then you smoke it intill you hit the DMT. Is that an effective method? I haven&#039;t done DMT yet but was probably going to try that way cuz I don&#039;t want a meth pipe lying around.

				I&#039;ve smoked it on top of a bowl of herb, it was the only time I could get high off DMT.&nbsp; Although it wasn&#039;t very good DMT (bought it off the street)&nbsp; :(.&nbsp; Might have to try it again some day.

				For me the best way to vape DMT is from that inner prana, heat rises up the spine the BAM! DMT turns straight into ether!
