				Slightly anxious noob here<br /><br />I placed an order this morning with a vendor who does next day delivery and I&#039;m //really// counting on this arriving tomorrow <br /><br />Its now the afternoon and there has been no update the order still says processing with no FE date and no option to cancel.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there&#039;s nothing to worry about as the vendor has very good feedback, however I just want to try and put my mind at ease by perhaps hearing other peoples experiences, e.g have you received packages before the vendor has had chance to mark it as sent? stuff like that.

				I&#039;d give it a full day honestly. While in some cases (it&#039;s happened to me before) vendors have shipped same day (if I ordered late the night before or super early morning), it&#039;s definitely not unusual for it to take 1 or even 2 full days before it gets sent out.

				Thanks for your reply <br /><br />The only thing that&#039;s bugging me is that its stated on the vendors description that all orders before a certain time are sent out the same day etc. and on the feedback there are plenty of people who are saying stuff like awsome came next day etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping I haven&#039;t done something wrong on my end<br />

				After the cutoff time he probably has a few more orders to package up and then take to the mailbox.&nbsp; Then he will come back and mark in transit.&nbsp; If hes a dick hell just mark in transit and ship when he gets around to it.&nbsp; Your end is prob alright

				My experience has been 24-48 hours. One guy took almost 4 days, but he was legitimately backed up.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t responding to people&#039;s questions...everyone thought he split, but we all ended up getting our packages.

				Depends on the seller. MeGrimlock is by far the fastest vendor I&#039;ve dealt with, literally marks in transit within a few hours. . .and he isn&#039;t lying either. Usually arrives within 4 days.

				It depends, they&#039;re all different. He might have a day job, maybe he drops them in the post at lunch and then updates to &quot;in transit&quot; when he gets home from work. Ya never really know.

				I hate assholes who mark in transit before they send it.&nbsp; Also vendors who take forever to read messages.&nbsp; Some vendors think because they deal drugs they dont have the time to communicate with their customer or even listen to what they have to say.&nbsp;

				We for one, process all orders that have come in from the previous day, &amp; keep processing until the cutoff time, get them packaged &amp; when all the packages have been dropped will mark in transit.&nbsp; However sometimes we have other things to do &amp; can&#039;t get back to mark everything until later, but not all vendors even process orders every day, some only process twice a week.<br /><br />NCK

				I think it&#039;s best to order on a Monday/Tuesday if you want something for the weekend. The packing process is probably very time consuming, so if they&#039;ve received a lot of orders you could be waiting a while. The few orders I&#039;ve made were all packed quickly, with one exception which is pending (I placed it yesterday morning).

				I waited a week in &quot;processing&quot; then another few days &quot;in transit&quot; during JOR&#039;s closing down sale. Everything turned up eventually though. Try not to worry about it until you have to (ie. you&#039;re close to auto-finalising).
