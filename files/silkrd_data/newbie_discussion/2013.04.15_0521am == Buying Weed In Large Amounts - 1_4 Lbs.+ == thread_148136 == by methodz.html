				Hey all, <br /><br />I am fairly new to the road, but was curious if anyone could share their experiences buying larger quantities of weed, a quarter pound or more. <br /><br />I have been buying small (1oz) but it is way cheaper in the long run typically to buy in larger quantities. However, I am a little timid as higher amounts lead to higher penalties if found. <br /><br />I know that good vendors have stealth that prevents smells, etc., and I only buy domestically, but I was wondering how many people are comfortable buying that amount and if it is worth the risk. Really just hoping someone can ease my paranoia. <br /><br />Thanks!

				You will be fine. Just continue to order from reputable vendors and you will have no problems. Resist the urges of going with newer vendors who might have slightly better prices. Stick with vendors who have a reputation for shipping bulk. I&#039;ve made countless bulk orders and never had an issue.

				Awesome, thank you for your input. The only step left in buying bulk is getting the coin... ;)

				If this is all just for personal use I would review your state laws and think it over. Does the price really matter that much if you go from mis to a fel ? Just saying .... If you do decide to go this way I would at least split it up after you receive it to stay under limits. Safety first!

				Following I&#039;ve always been interested in this subject I just can&#039;t imagine a pound fitting in my mail box.

The laws in my state are a little weird, 10 to 30 grams carries a similar penalty as up to 500g for a first offense. I have a clean record but definitely not trying to spend $10k in lawyer fees lol. Going to have to think about it, I guess.

				Im curious, I can&#039;t necessarilly imagine the size of a 1lb stealth packed order shipped.<br /><br />Anyone who has ordered this before able to give approximate dimensions. Or what I&#039;m really getting at, is it possible that it can fit inside a large p.o. box? I know most people have small ones that fit envelopes and magazines and what not but I have seen the ones that are a decent size and could fit some average size boxes.<br /><br />Thanks

				I think as long as the vendor knows what he is doing and has taken every precautionary step then you should be fine. Especially vendors that are implementing low permeability bags, such as Mylar and moisture barrier bags. I know its the next step in my shipping methods. Especially for ounces and QP&#039;s.&nbsp; Whether it is a small envelope or a medium size box I think it makes no difference as long as stealth is really taken care of. Just my two cents.&nbsp;
