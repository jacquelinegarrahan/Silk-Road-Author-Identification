				Let&#039;s get to 50.<br /><br />Briefly as you can, tell me something funny or fucked up you&#039;ve experienced on a drug. And what drug was it? <br /><br />Recently, was watching a historical documentary-movie about 1700s boat stuff. Really boring. During one part I looked at my friend and said, &quot;Oh the sea monster is here.&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh yeah it is...&quot; and we watched it for a few minutes before realizing the sea monster was a piece of ship wood they were looking at in the water. This was on acid.

				Alien invasion after taking ~900mg of methoxetamine in the space of maybe 6-8 hours. Terrifying. I wrote a big trip report about it, lasted over 24 hours and I think it was more of a psychotic break than just a trip lol. But since this is supposed to be brief I&#039;ll just say I took mxe, had fun for a while, took much more and then flipped out and thought my neighbourhood was being invaded.<br /><br />I think there may be some underlying thing that causes people to think aliens (or foreigners) are invading. It seems to be a common one. Maybe humans are just inherently scared of the unknown, and so when we have paranoid delusions they involve aliens, or strange people from other countries invading (probably less of that now that everyone is connected via the web)

				I saw one of my friends OD on heroin in front of me. I went over to his house right after I cashed my check and bought a 50 sack of H. We both shot up and just started to talk. This was some amazing heroin probably the strongest I ever had. I was feeling amazing just spaced out thinking about the world when I notice my friend slump over. I ran over to him and tried to wake him up but no luck. So I start to panic and finally I come to a decision that I&#039;ve gotta drive him to the hospital. I some how drag his ass into the back seat of my car which is quite the task in my state. Then I drive as fast as I can to the ER yelling &quot;you better not die&quot;. Once I get to the front of the hospital I run inside and get the closest person to help me get my friend inside. I was so high I&#039;m pretty sure it was hard to comprehend what I was saying. They finally got my friend into the ER and I just sat in the waiting room high as fuck crying my eyes out. About an hour later I found out they resuscitated him. When I went up to his room I asked, &quot;what happened&quot;? Apparently he had just shot up 30 minutes before I showed up. I was pissed at that fucker for months. After that I decided I was done with opiates. I didn&#039;t want to risk that happening to me and have someone go through something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				If your friend had died, you would have been living under an overwhelming cloud of shame, since everyone would know you were a heroin addict, and your friend died on your watch and you might have been directly responsible for his death, since you furnished the drugs and you were too high to save him in time.&nbsp; That was a lucky break for you.&nbsp; Having a friend die on you, whose overdose you are blamed for causing, would be a hard weight to carry.

				Once fell through a trippy concert poster. It became a 3-D swirling, very layered fractal, and slowly expanded to fill my entire field of vision. It was sort of like sci-fi wormhole, but more minimalist. I was slowly drawn into it, felt gravity reverse. I was falling for a long time, then abruptly came out of it when my head touched the glass. LSD, of course.

				These are awesome (except the OD story, sorry man).<br /><br />I&#039;ll do another. Since I&#039;m taking forever to get to 50.<br /><br />I took two hits of Salvia and all of reality disappeared around me. I think this is the first and only time I had a complete break from it. When I came to I was sitting underneath a table in the hotel room. The last thing I remembered was as if I was standing above the room, but everything in it was a cartoon based fantasy land. My friends were mythological creatures and two of them were the Queens of the land. They were telling me to stay here with them and not to return to reality. There was dancing bears made of honey and bright rainbows and transparent clouds in the sky. I was hesitant and I felt as if the room was about to explode and the reality would vanish. Finally, right before the &quot;bubble burst&quot; I said, &quot;Fuck it, I&#039;m going to stay here with you.&quot; and the next thing I knew I opened my eyes underneath the furniture. It was extremely intense.

				This story is definitely on the light side compared to stories above:<br /><br />Back in 2008, friend brought over a couple of shroom caps and convinced me to do it, even though it was a work night. I finally caved and took a cap since I knew it would only last a few hours.<br />Well, he convinced me to come with him to hang out a friends house. So I rode with him, and by the time we got there, the trip was full on, and I just wasn&#039;t having a great time on them - pretty much the whole time I had that anxious, uncomfortable feeling.<br />Plus we just kept driving places, which made me more uncomfortable - I just wanted to chill at one place, and at this point, I just wanted to go home and stop moving around so much.<br /><br />So fast forward a little, we&#039;re in the middle of the trip and in the car again, and there&#039;s now 4 of us in the car, and it&#039;s probably around midnight and we&#039;re driving down the car and we notice a bunch of cop lights on the other side of the median/road, and as we drive past them we see an overturned car - let me tell you seeing that whole scene while tripping on these &quot;bad&quot; shrooms was not fun. I told them to drive me home right now. lol<br /><br />I say &quot;bad&quot; because the first time I did shrooms I had a much different experience - could have just been setting but whatever you want to attribute it to, this trip was pretty shitty.<br /><br /><br />

				I either had a bad trip with molly or took an even worse substance. I went to a concert at Red Rocks and it got kinda weird. For anyone who doesn&#039;t know,the Red Rocks Amphitheatre is an outdoor concert area snuggled in the rocks and overlooking Denver. I was good at first..dancing, laughing and having a great time. From then on I black out quite a bit, and had some fucked up experiences.<br /><br />I thought that the massive arena was where we go when we die, and is the step before eternal death. I honestly thought that suicide was the only way out of this place, and am still scared to this day about what I could have done if I wasn&#039;t with friends. I remember looking into the crowd and seeing thousands of people bumping their fists in synchronization like a giant machine. One of my friends decided I should go home early, and took me to the hotel in a cab, which was even more fucked. Some 20 year old girl was in there and I was convinced she was an elf because she was wearing all this raver gear and had sparkles on her face,. It must have been after that that I threw up all over myself, while still being transported via taxi. My buddy later told me the cabby almost kicked us out on Colfax in Denver, which would have been a nightmare. Ended the night wandering around in an almost drunken fashion with puke all over myself while my buddy tried to get a hotel key because he lost it.<br /><br />Anyway, I know it&#039;s a long story but I was wondering if anyone knew what it could have been?

				CONVINCED myself that my fiance had somehow overdosed on 2-c-t7 when she took 10mg of 2c-e orally, then managed to convince HER of the same thing. Our best friend and my mother (was still living at home at the time) both had to spend about 45 minutes talking us down from that.
