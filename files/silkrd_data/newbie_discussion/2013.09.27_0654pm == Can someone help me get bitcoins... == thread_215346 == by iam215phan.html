				You can do that, but I never have. There are several legitimate btc on SR, I&#039;m sure. So no offense to any of those vendors, but it&#039;s just too easy to get scammed by buying your coins on SR, especially for your first ever transaction. I don&#039;t recommend it. If you want to go that route, search these forums THOROUGHLY and find a reputable vendor.<br /><br />I always recommend localbitcoins.com now that bitinstant is closed. They have seller rankings and an escrow service on localbitcoins. It&#039;s super easy to use. Give it a try!

				i second localbitcoins.com.<br />it&#039;s easy to use, reliable, and most importantly, can be quite anonymous.<br />find a seller who has 30+ reviews. the most anonymous options are: 1) face to face cash, 2) cash deposit, 3) cash in mail<br />welcome to the Road and good luck<br /><br />ps: i highly recommend you jump into the forums every now and then. even if you&#039;re here just to purchase drugs, there&#039;s a wide array of information, tips, and best practices offered by some amazing people which will definitely benefit anyone.<br />

				The guys above who said that the vendors on here can easily scam you are right, with that said, I have used some of those vendors when I needed BTC&#039;s fast. It can be hours faster than going outside for BTC&#039;s. I can vouch for the vendor Collapses. He&#039;s legit, and fast . He doesn&#039;t always have BTC&#039;s available though, but when he does, he&#039;s fast and reliable.

				Get on Facebook and search for &quot;Bitcoin Friends&quot;. There are more than one, so click on the one with the more &#039;Likes&#039;. It&#039;s a group of reputable bitcoin buyers/sellers. I&#039;ve used them several times. They&#039;re incredibly fast, and incredibly flexible (they even accept PayPal, which means you can pay with a credit/debit card if you have one linked to your PayPal account).

				I am also new (been here for about 2 weeks)&nbsp; I had the hardest time figuring out how to get btc.&nbsp; I wanted to get btc using PayPal.&nbsp; I found btcquick.com&nbsp; I signed up and without too much difficulty I was able to purchase btc using my PayPal debit card.&nbsp; It took all of 30 minutes for the first purchase.<br /><br />I went back 2 days ago and made a 2nd purchase and it was done in 15 minutes.&nbsp; For being a newbie they made it quick and easy for me.<br /><br />I hope it helps<br /><br />The Gringo

				Don&#039;t use a CC or paypal... It&#039;s not worth it. I guess if you tumble, you&#039;d be safe, but why add any more risks?<br /><br />Go on localbitcoins and either do bank deposit or (even better) buy from a local guy with cash.

				I can provide btc and always have them available. Also, I can offer a superior rate compared to the competition. I&#039;ve had plenty of off SR transactions, so my vendor page doesn&#039;t reflect very many, but that&#039;s because I just started reaching out to people here because I know how hard it can be to get coins and want to provide a fast, easy, reliable way to get them. <br /><br />PM me or email me at libertycoin@safe-mail.net if interested. I am very reliable and can get you your coins within minutes.

				Purchased btc from MoneyPakJack multiple times and had coins in under 15 minutes in my account - untraceable.&nbsp; Great communications, converse ahead of time to be sure he&#039;s got some and ready.&nbsp; Way to easy.&nbsp; Risk - considerable, but this place is full of risk.&nbsp; You just got to decide for yourself where your going to place yours and how much info your willing to release onto a computer.&nbsp; Stay safe.

				I like LibertyCoin. You won&#039;t find rates lower than his and I had my BTC in my SR account in about 20-30mins after he got the info. You can check out his review thread if you want to read my full review, the link is in his signature and I think it&#039;s on his vendor profile page that&#039;s in my sig.
