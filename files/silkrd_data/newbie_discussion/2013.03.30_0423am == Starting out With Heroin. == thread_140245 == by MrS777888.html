				Just in case you&#039;re wondering, I am not new to drugs. It started with cannabis in my late teens then progressed to ecstasy, meth, LSD, shrooms, deixies, various OTC opiates, etc etc. I am 35 now.<br /><br />I have always been warned by friends for me to steer clear of H, but with no more of a reason than &#039;don&#039;t do it man&#039;... That&#039;s not good enough.<br /><br />The way I figure, I would have gone off the rails along time ago if i was that was inclined, so I can&#039;t see how trying some H will change or destroy my life.

				it will only destroy your life if you become completely addicted and sit around all day shooting up. have you had any problems with addictions? what other opiates have you tried and with what ROA? i would rate meth as much more dangerous and bad for you physical and mental health. heroin isnt going to cause you much hard unless you overdose or have complications shooting up. i would recommend snorting or smoking it VERY RARELY or you may find yourself on the needle

				I&#039;m a noob to heroin, have only ever smoked 1 gram of it in my life, but I went through much the same with friends and family repeating the government propaganda of &quot;do it once and your hooked&quot;, so I thought I would share my thoughts on it.<br /><br />I recently purchased my first and only gram of heroin on silk road, it was BTH from Nod. i told myself it was for experimentation purposes only and I would not buy any more after it for at least a period of several months from running out. One thing to consider is that my wife and i both got sick to our stomachs the first 3-4 times we smoked, which I hear is normal. It was not instantly addictive, and has definitely been made out to be much worse than it is. One use is not going to ruin your life. I actually think that the propaganda about it is more dangerous than the drug itself. I think that too many people try it once and realize it&#039;s not instantly habit forming, and so they take it again, and again, and again and then its all over. I also noticed that spending a night smoking tar left me with a nasty hangover, and it seemed like the more i smoked and the longer i smoked, the worse the hangover. I think a very important rule for recreational heroin use is to NEVER use it consecutively, i heard the 8/72 hours rule but I would suggest more down time than that personally for safety. and when its gone, walk away for a good long period of time. The biggest thing to understand is that it is an insidious drug, and I can see now how it can sneak up on you. I bought my 1 gram telling myself I would never buy heroin again. I told myself we&#039;d only do it once every couple weeks. We actually went through the gram in 6 sittings over a two week period. Now my wife and I are discussing buying another gram in a few months. Is that addiction? Or is it just liking the high? Like I said, I&#039;m no expert, I fiend way harder for coke than I do heroin lol. be safe, have a plan, and be aware of the dangers and you should be fine. Be smart though and stay away from IVing it. I don&#039;t care how good the rush is, it&#039;s not worth the damage to your body OR your mind. I&#039;ve never IV&#039;d heroin just smoked it, though I IV&#039;d meth during a 1 year long meth addiction in the mid 90&#039;s. IVing is just a foolish, reckless way to go! If it&#039;s not pharmaceutical grade, don&#039;t stick it in your veins. <br /><br />If you want a small amount of good BTH, try Nod4less, that&#039;ll be enough of good tar to get you up at least a time or four depending on your tolerance! Be safe!<br /><br />Thegalactica420 is right on the money... Meth is WAY more addictive in my experience, it just doesn&#039;t have nearly as bad of a physical addiction.

				There&#039;s soooo much propaganda about heroin that even other drug users have a stigma around it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another drug, yes it&#039;s addictive, but so is alcohol.&nbsp; &nbsp;It really depends on you and your self control.<br /><br />I can use off and on as long as I&#039;m hard on myself and force myself not to use too often in a row.&nbsp; You won&#039;t get addicted after your first time, but of course you&#039;re going to want to use again, it feels great.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just keep yourself honest and don&#039;t get in a place where you&#039;re going to go through withdrawals.&nbsp; For me it&#039;s not even the physical sickness, it&#039;s the mental depression; awful, lonely, frightening, depression.&nbsp; But It was the same depression I got with alcohol withdrawals, just without the overwhelming anxiety, and the real fear of death.....

				If you havent tried ot yet don&#039;t even try it lol. Especially silk road heroin. Haven&#039;t tried SR heroin, but I imagine its not your everyday street heroin. I imagine its much much stronger.

				I smoked it once before. Made my stomach churn like a washing machine on spin cycle. Enough to put me off it again, despite the dreamy / yellow high off it.<br /><br />Would never IV anything. Fuck that. There&#039;s enough ways to get high cleanly.<br /><br />I imagine every addict you see started out the same way, thinking they were totally in control etc. Even previous users of other drugs. Be careful.

				Hey mate if you wanna try it why not just get on it.<br /><br />Since you said Insufflation would be your ROA just start at like 20mg or less and see how you go.<br /><br />Keep in mind when you snort it you want to go easy so it does not go down the back of your throat since the bioavailability of heroin in the stomach is poor.<br /><br />ozexpress is the only vendor i could vouch for at the moment and he is taking a break for a few weeks.<br /><br />Cheers.

				You seem to be very apt in trying it. Most people are telling you not to do it and you don&#039;t agree.<br /><br />DO IT!!! You won&#039;t get addicted in the next couple of months but I am sure even without knowing you that if you use it you will commit some big fuck up on your personal and professional life in the next 12 months.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Just limit yourself to three days max.<br />I only do it once a year or so.<br />I&#039;ve done lots of opiates, but I do steer clear of H for the most part.<br />It&#039;s easy to get carried away.<br />

				I would stay away as it is pure fucking bliss. Unfortunately the amount it takes to reach bliss gets closer and closer to the amount it takes to kill you. Furthermore, after using it life just isn&#039;t as interesting and aches and pains give way to unbearable misery which you know the cure for is more heroin.<br /><br />That said, there are plenty of sellers. The prices on this site are expensive, at least compared to where I am from. For a casual user this would be a good place to get dope from.<br /><br />I am close to Mexico and used to buy dope here for about $60-80 a gram for potent black tar. In Mexico is was a little cheaper but sold in tiny amounts for only a few pesos. Not many wholesalers were willing to associate with gringos where I spent time.

The threat of addiction is very real even though you have made it this far. It&#039;s a bad idea to count on just getting sick of it. You got to keep your shit under control. Good luck.

				With any drug there is a possibility of addiction - the only advice i get is from someone whose been there. So read between the lines. Would you take medical advice from someone who is not a doctor? If you do thats why they don&#039;t let those idiots write prescriptions.<br /><br />Take alcohol for example, about 1% of drinkers become alcoholics. There will always be that % of people who will become addicts first go, just depends on how your brain chemistry works<br /><br />Now take Heroin, there is a MUCH higher possibility of addiction, i would say 10% of users in RL and about less than 1% of SR users... SR users seem to have their shit together... i was pleasantly surprise, nealy 90% of&nbsp; SR customers have proper jobs and use this recreationally, other 10% were addicts and just saving money by not buying junk on the streets.<br /><br />Some people say its higher like 50% of users get addicts, but you have to remember what kind of drug people use Herioin. Before you moved to Heroin, you would have probably tired alcohol, MDMA, Cocaine, Oxy, etc Herion is usually the final stop. So these people had drug problems before they started using Heroin. They might have psycological issues to begin with. <br /><br />More of the addictive personality and prone to abuse drugs. I&#039;ve spoken to many of my IRL customers, and the addicts are the ones who told me they have been abused as a child, by uncles, relatives, they come from a family that does not support each other, have shit parents, lack of financial support, etc etc list can go on, <br /><br />This is just self medicating themselves. Dealers don&#039;t create most the addicts, its the failure of society, that leads to self medication. If there was more education about law and society, cops would catch more rapists / abusers, and if there was more social support or if it was easier to get social support to treat psycological / mental issues, there would be only users and not addicts. <br /><br />Because H makes you feel so good, people take it so they dont have to face the real problems in their lives or in their past.<br /><br />As for H itself, yes its terribly addictive. You can easily loose control. You need to have very strong will power to use it recreationally. I would nearly say flip a coin. Coz thats your chances of loosing self control. The addicts that are made from heroin are addicts for life. It PERMANENTLY changes and rearranges pathways to the fun and &quot;reward&quot; receptors in your brain. You will want Heroin over food, sex, family, friends, money,&nbsp; you will even sleep in a cardboard box as long as you can get your heroin, etc etc. You need to be aware of that. Even when you go on the methadone, it will stop the urges but you will still always in the back of your mind want some. <br /><br />My recommendation? When you kids are grown up, you are retiring and you have a bit of $$$ to live out your days. You have NO responsibilities to your friends and family.&nbsp; Where you are at an age when your family and friends have a responsibility to you because you are old, grumpy and generally useless (im sure we all take care of one of those people in our lives). all u do is chew up shit loads of meds all day just to get by... thats when i would start treating yourself to some Heroin. <br /><br />I see some people dying of cancer, wanting to just die because of the pain.... shit, fuck the meds, just treat them with heroin for their last few months of their lives, they will feel happier than never before, it will be the best time of their lives and they wont wanna die.&nbsp; When i am at that age and i need to die, i&#039;m going down with my Herioin thats the sure, it will also save a hospital bed, doctors and nursers to prolong what is a shitty existence, but my euthanasia argument is for another day.<br /><br />My final advice is, don&#039;t use heroin, there are plenty of other drugs you can legally get fucked up with, or less harmful drugs you can get fucked up with while you are still young. Read the effects, educate yourself but Save Heroin for your retirement coz this shit... opiates is another class on its own.<br /><br />- ozexpress
