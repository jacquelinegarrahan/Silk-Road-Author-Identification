				I&#039;m asking this because I had a vendor ask me to FE today for having under 10 purchases. That would be fine, except that when I look at my purchasing stats, it shows 74 all time and 40 in the last year.<br /><br />So are they getting a different view than me? I&#039;m not worried about getting scammed. He&#039;s informed me that he&#039;ll cancel my order if I don&#039;t agree, so I won&#039;t lose my money. I&#039;m just curious if there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing?

				Vendors see the exact same as you. I&#039;d just ask that vendor to cancel your order if I were you. Sounds like it&#039;d be the easiest thing to do ;)

				Thanks! That&#039;s what I thought. It just seemed odd because there&#039;s no mistaking &lt;10 with 75. I&#039;ve never FE&#039;d before so I&#039;m assuming this will be canceled.<br /><br />I did write back to him to say he was mistaken on the off chance that he was high (ya never know)

				Yes they do get your stats, that sounds like a FE scam to me but some vendors require 10 successful transactions with them which is stupid out of interest who is the vendor and with your 74 and 40 are they proper orders or like the lotto etc

I&#039;ve spent $30+k in 2 years, so no, they&#039;re real purchases.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to name the vendor at this point. He hasn&#039;t had time to respond to my message yet, and in fairness to him, he did say he&#039;d cancel the order if I didn&#039;t FE. He wrote to me to ask if I was OK with FE because it was required for less than 10 transactions.<br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t know what the fuck he&#039;s talking about. When I look at my stats, the only part under 10 is for this month only (which is 3). Who knows?
