				Yes, just like you can look at your past orders and see who you have bought off of.&nbsp; Depending on the circumstances or amount of product that the vendor was moving during your last order, they also might just remember getting an order from your username.

				Not really that everyone else can see, but vendors communicate with each other and can put you on a blacklist so that other vendors won&#039;t do business with you.&nbsp; This usually only happens if you try to scam them by saying that you did not receive what you ordered, but, a small few vendors abuse this power to get good reviews out of people.<br />

Not in the way that you think though. Frequently vendors on silkroad will pressure buyers into 5/5ing because they are holding all the cards. THey have your address, name, and evidence of drug trafficking attached to your name. Some dishonest vendors will threaten you with this info.
