				Minimum standard in what respect? Stealth can come in a whole lot of forms, so I guess my minimum standard is...reasonably stealthy. Not trying to be a jackass, I just don&#039;t really understand what you&#039;re asking.<br /><br />Edit: these two below me are much more helpful, especially Taklamak4n. Listen to them. I agree with T -- depends entirely on what you are sending/receiving.

				I usually get mine double vac sealed due to the detectability (Amphetamines), comes usually wrapped in fake documents or ripped chucks of cardboard. I only get maximum 50g though in 1 letter cause anything over that I feel is a bit too much for 1 letter - most vendors will work with you to split the other, most times for free including express post costs!! Only if you order bulk like I do though xD

				any one in australia got anything to share?<br /><br />You will usually have a 30% success rate getting things in to Australia because they scan so many items. This is my experience though and I don&#039;t think my vendors put enough effort into stealth.

				My 2 cents on overseas shipping: if it is properly disguised in letter mail, it will clear customs with very fast and I have had orders from France to the West Coast US take 4 days no shit. If you can properly disguise your product with a thick piece of cardstock or two thin pieces of cardboard and maybe an unscented dryer sheet on each inside of the cardboard. Bottom line don&#039;t make it too thick, but make sure your product can&#039;t be felt easily through the outside of the envelope. Also, I would recommend a windowed envelope and make sure the delivery address shows and the return address shows (business name and address is the smartest. Seeal the envelope with a sponge and water (DNA) and add postage and tracking how ever see fit.

				That&#039;s a good one to know, I just stress because Australian Customs have really picked up their act lately and are scanning a lot more letters. I used to get a lot through, but not now.

				Yes, Australia does scan a lot, but they use ion smellers to detect possible contaminated packages.. So even a small dust on a letter can make whole bunch of leters look suspicios and they should be scaned individualy.

				Order from a vendor who is known for having legendary stealth and find out, thats the best way.&nbsp; The best stealth is when&nbsp; you get the package and dont realise its SR.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0<br />everything you need to know about stealth packaging can be found here :)<br />Things like drier sheets and carbon paper don&#039;t work, vac sealing can be useful for compressing a package for shipping but it isn&#039;t smellproof and should only be used in tandem with a moisture barrier bag :)<br />

				Having amusing stealth is a bonus. Still new around here, but I do like receiving packages that are a laugh when they end up in the mailbox. <br /><br />Only ordered domestic so far though, still scared to test customs until I find a tried and true seller overseas.

				The ion detection is what they use at the airports (that millimeter detector has it in there). Moisture barrier bags are the best method of stealth protection against dogs/detectors.
