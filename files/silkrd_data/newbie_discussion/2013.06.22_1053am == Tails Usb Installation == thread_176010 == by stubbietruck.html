				Hi, I was hoping someone might be able to help me with referance to the awesome thread that is in the security forum, Full tutorial-installing tails Live USB with a persitant volume by Fallkniven. As i cant post there i cannot reply directly to that thread.<br />I have reached the very last step..number 11 which talks about confuguring network connections? Is this neccesary as ...well im here ...so I am connected right? I came though to Sr , on my tails&nbsp; on my USB with the pestant Volume. One thing that was weird though is at the login screens for Both SR and the forum a warning screen appeared stating the info will be sent over a non encrypted line??? Is that normal? I am a bit lost as what exactly I should be doing at this step. I figured if internet wasnt set up I wouldnt be able to get on?<br />Sorry if im rambling most of the install was a head fuck as I had to reformatt myUSB to get the fucker to boot.<br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can shed some light here

				Sounds like you&#039;ve set it up fine to me...and that &quot;warning screen appeared stating the info will be sent over a non encrypted line&quot; is normal.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am pretty mashed right now though

				it gives that error because you&#039;re not making a ssl connection... or at least not making one that the browser can recognize. the browser thinks that just because the url doesnt start out with https, that its not a secure connection. tor, by its very concept, is the most secure connection you can have. <br /><br />ps... and if it helps ease your mind, once a page is requested through tor, the network itself is masked through a ssl connection; so, all roads lead to nowhere. <br /><br />dont forget to rep :)

				Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don&#039;t resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.
