				I wanted to be able to post this is the Product requests but I cannot seem to create a new post there so it is here instead. <br /><br />I would really really like to see far more UK to UK subutex listings, there are next to none. I can&#039;t understand why there is literally no one in the UK selling subbies - am I missing something?. I was also really very surprised, when I did find a subutex listing, at how much they were - I know that there will be difference between street and online prices but this is not a matter of quality, as with other items, simply P&amp;P. I have seen one 8mg posted for the same price as I have been able to 6 x 8mg on the street. I am sure with greater competition prices would come down. Can anyone suggest where else I am able to get reasonably priced subbies preferably UK to UK postage online???? Many thanks :-)
