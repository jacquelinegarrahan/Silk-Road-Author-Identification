				This is happening to me as well.&nbsp; I made a deposit of around 7.5 earlier today, and now I have over 90.&nbsp; There is a big thread in the main forum about this, it looks like it is happening to a lot of folks.&nbsp; Not sure what will be the fallout of this..I just hope my order I placed earlier will still go through!

				hmmm well it seems to be an error/glitch on SR&#039;s side as the blockchain doesn&#039;t report multiple transactions like some are seeing and well just to good to be true.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand though is the HUGE transactions going through on blockchain.info.&nbsp; I have seen 4000-6000 transactions&nbsp; :o<br />I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s normal or not.<br /><br />Dang I wish I could post in the big boy forums, oh well I&#039;ll get there soon enough

				If you&#039;re up for spreading the love, my SR name is the same as the one on here. :-)<br /><br />Though I do imagine that using your extra BTC to fund large orders wouldn&#039;t be the best idea, despite many people I imagine doing this..
