				Ok so I finally tried bitinstant again today.&nbsp; It worked fine but was a crazy pain in the ass.<br /><br />First I created a verified account, not my info.&nbsp; Took me 3 accounts before I got one to go through.&nbsp; This takes forever, first have to create a new email for the account.&nbsp; Then make an account at Bitinstant.&nbsp; They send an email to the new email address, you click the link and it takes you to a verification page.&nbsp; They ask 3 questions based on public records.&nbsp; For example, say I created an account Roberto Lopez.&nbsp; The questions are similiar to<br />1.&nbsp; Which of the following streets have you never lived on&nbsp; (gives 5 choices)<br />2.&nbsp; What is the closest age range to Maria Lopez (gives 5 choices)<br />3.&nbsp; What year is your mercedes S500 (gives 5 choices)<br /><br />If you dont get it right it will say verification failed.&nbsp; Then you can log out, and log in and try again.&nbsp; It will let you try 3 times before saying you have to wait a week to try again.<br /><br />So took me a few tries to get one to go through.&nbsp; And I had some of each persons info.&nbsp; So I can imagine how hard it will be if you try guessing a completely random person.<br /><br />When its verified, it will let you do 500$ US per transaction, $2000 daily limit.&nbsp; You can upload an ID to raise the limits I did not do this so I dont know what raised limits will be.<br /><br />I did one transaction, I had my coins less than hour after I paid.&nbsp; I did a few more before I hit the daily limit. <br />One thing I noticed that sucked is once you start putting in a transaction there is no going back.&nbsp; I had one stop before I got the zipzap payment info, but it still listed thetransaction as pending and there was no way to cancel it, and no way to get the zipzap info.&nbsp; But it still counted that transactoin towards the daily limit.<br /><br />So because of that I had to eihter wait 24 hours for more coins or make another account.&nbsp; So I made another , again it took a few tries and is such a pain in the ass to have to make a new email account and a new bitinstant account each time. <br /><br />But once I had the accounts verified, they worked like a charm.&nbsp; Each time the coins were in my wallet within an hour after moneygram. <br /><br />One question for anyone else that has done this, did you do the ID verification?&nbsp; Does it ask for front and back of the ID, or just the front?&nbsp; And what are the raised limits if you verify ID?

				Cool <br />Thanks for the quick response.<br /><br />1. What is OP? When you create a login I heard someone mention they create an email via hotmail because they dont ask you for a retrieval email.<br /><br />2. So you don&#039;t use your personal info. Is there ever a problem at walmart if they ask for I.d. some say they don&#039;t ask you for i.d. How do you do it?<br /><br />3. If I decide to send to blockchain.info do I put the address on the bitinstant request page first and then blockchain will then ask me for SR wallet address?

				Yes use pgp for anything sensative.&nbsp; Definately use when placing orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its not as confusing as it seems.<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />This link will tell you easy and step by step how to do it, and then go and practice a couple times on the pgp thread so you know you can do it

				yep - no going back.&nbsp; anyway - SR works great if you just use some common-sense &amp; patience.&nbsp; as for PGP, in many case all you will ever do is encrypt your mailing address.&nbsp; as with many things, it comes down to what you wish to accomplish - is it just the enjoyment of sharing and recreational use, or will it be more of a true business enterprise?<br />don&#039;t make the process harder than necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;yeah - blockchain has a great wallet, some folks like to set up 1 or 2 other wallets, to maintain a lot of anonymity as they shuffle BTc.
