				i&#039;ve heard at least 5 groups are already racing to put up the new silk road, and been in two forums where this is being discussed as we speak. my guess is there are plenty more too. everyone from russian mafia to hundreds of geeks in their moms basements are all racing to cash in on the silk road brand that is currently going to the first person to grab it. i wouldn&#039;t be surprised if about 3 different silk roads all exactly the same appear within weeks. plus a whole host of silk road clone phishing sites to boot. everyone knows how much money is there for the taking now, so its just a matter of time. <br /><br />whether any of these sites will follow the dpr philosophy and not just rip the fuck out of everyone is another matter all together tho.
