				First of all, thanks FoxyR2 for lending me .03 btc earlier.&nbsp; due to fluctuation of BTC pricing i was short on ordering something and within an hour of putting up a post i got a reply not only from Foxy, but from several other people as well.&nbsp; it surprised me how caring people are on SR, really looking out for eachother, from accurate vendor reviews and warning which vendors to avoid, to lending a small amount of btc so someone can place their order without having to wait a few more days.&nbsp; just wanted to say thanks for the Good Looks everyone, including Foxy.<br /><br /><br />When most people hear &quot;silkroad&quot; they usually think of a dark stingy part of the internet where drug addicts and criminals come to buy and sell anything that is illegal.&nbsp; this simply is not the case, it is really the exact opposite.&nbsp; there is not bullshit involved when using SR.&nbsp; you order your product, and it arrives a few days later.&nbsp; that&#039;s it.&nbsp; there is no waiting in the middle of a dark alley hoping not to get robbed/ripped off/possibly killed.&nbsp; a majority of the vendors i have dealt with have been straight up with me, offering me quality product at fair prices.

				Although a outlet such as the one Sr provides would be seen or assumed to be ran by bottom of the barrel scum I feel from numerous orders The community Vendors, Users, Coinbrokers can only be seen as people a little bit smarter than the average bear to the point where street vendors, entrepreneurs, currency brokers look up and inspire to be on breaking edge of technology which has the ability lead the drug cultural in general to be accepted by reducing violence, improving honesty and intentions (&quot;SHOULD&quot;) be about getting your customers the experience expected+MORE. Personally have gained that reward inside by hooking others up with real lsd- popping their trip cherry, hearing people reflect their lessons, theories, hypothesis and outlooks<br />Than I have in money.

				I use LSD quite some time know but never knew how much ug is on each tab because no one knew. When i was buying drugs the only thing i knew was if its strong or not, that&#039;s all. I didn&#039;t even knew that i could buy reagent tests like eztests. And reading this forum I know I used nbome as LSD once in my life.. <br /><br />Yes, SR did open my EYES and I am really glad i don&#039;t have to deal with all those people that don&#039;t care about their products. They only care about money..<br /><br />And yes, SR community is really doing its best to show good and bad products as well as vendors.. <br />Great job everybody.. I learn from you all and Ill try to share with you my knowledge making this community better and better over time.
