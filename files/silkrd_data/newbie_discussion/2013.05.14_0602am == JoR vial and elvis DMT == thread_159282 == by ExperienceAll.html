A big glass one is the best. Then when you&#039;re smoking it, put the flame low and spread evenly, so the pipe and DMT doesn&#039;t get too hot. You need the DMT to evaporate, not to burn off instantaneously. Read a manual on the net, I&#039;m sure there is one. But beware, DMT smells like <br />burnt plastic. Not very nice.

				I bought 250mg of DMT from elvis and it seemed pretty good. It was my first DMT experience so I can&#039;t compare it to anything else.<br /><br />I think imma smoke the rest of it during my LSD trip saturday night.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				The weight was a little over. It was yellow and my experience was good. But I didn&#039;t really smoke much yet. I am waiting for a better time in a good environment. And I wanna get a better device to smoke it with. I took about 30 mg or so. I wanna smoke more before I write a full review!!!

				Really make sure you don&#039;t burn the DMT. My second time smoking I made my own device. A water bottle with the bottom cut off and put foil down there with dmt on foil. I heated from below, but I let it get way too hot. I took a huge rip and it burned the fuck out of my throat. I started tripping but my throat was so burned I couldn&#039;t even close my eyes to concentrate and I was tripping balls and I couldn&#039;t stop swallowing and I could feel everything in my throat working. I would recommend smoking it out of a meth pipe. I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but from what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s the best bang for your buck. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				If you are going to smoke DMT frequently, it may be worthwhile to buy a glass vapor genie... It&#039;s quite expensive, but once you master how to use it, you can consistently break trough with around 30 mg. Also I recommend that you check the DMT nexus forum/webpage for lots of information regarding DMT. Happy travels into hyperspace!
