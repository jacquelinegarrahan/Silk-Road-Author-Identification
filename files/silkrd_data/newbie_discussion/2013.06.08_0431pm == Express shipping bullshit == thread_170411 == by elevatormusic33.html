				Instead of re-typing my situation, I copied and pasted the message that I sent to this vendor. Let me just say that I&#039;m in no way saying that I&#039;m not finalizing whatsoever. I take my hat off to 95% of the vendors on SR for the fine job they do. I just feel kinda jipped w/ this transaction. Any feedback would be appreciated.<br /><br />Hey man, I placed 2 orders on the same day, one of them being yours, on Tuesday afternoon. I asked you before I ordered if you could ship &quot;express&quot; that day, which you replied yes, you could. Then after I ordered you messaged me and said it would be out first thing &quot;smoking&quot; in the morning. I understand you couldn&#039;t get it out Tuesday when I placed the order because I did order late in the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;Then when I asked you Wednesday if you sent my package and would I get it Thursday you said, yes, if you chose express. Well, I didn&#039;t get the package until today, as I also got a package I ordered the same day from Seattle that I paid $6 for priority. And after looking up the tracking # I see that it wasn&#039;t sent until Thursday. I understand that you have a lot of business, and that it takes time to process orders, but I communicated with you, paid nearly $30 for shipping, and I feel like I was lied to about the shipping. I paid that extra $30 so that I could get it on Thursday because I was planning to go on vacation on Thursday. If you wouldn&#039;t have told me that you would send it out that day, then I could have changed my plans accordingly.

				You&#039;re in the right. If the vendor is accepting express shipping options and tells you s/he&#039;s gonna ship it out, s/he should ship it out the day s/he specified. I&#039;d change the feedback rating accordingly to that unless you&#039;re compensated for, ya know?<br /><br />I always get upset when I order and I&#039;m told it&#039;ll ship today/next day then 2 days later &quot;It ships this weekend&quot;<br /><br />like buddy this is your job. Do it right.

				Do you think a refund of the Express shipping fee is asking too much? I just think it&#039;s funny that a package from Seattle arrive before my Express package, and I paid $6 for the Seattle package.&nbsp; Like I said before, I know just because it says &quot;in transit&quot; does not mean it has been shipped, but this vendor assured me it was shipped that day, and the tracking number said otherwise.
