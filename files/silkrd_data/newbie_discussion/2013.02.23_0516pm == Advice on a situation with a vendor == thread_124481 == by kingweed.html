				I suggest you don&#039;t bother him anymore and cross your fingers. This thread alone might get him to say fk it. You FE&#039;d and now you have zero recourse. Stop crying and be patient. If you never get the product post a review in his thread here or start one if none exists, ONE.

				I have been an sr member for almost a year and have bought differant things and quantities from all over the world. The is my new bendors account and so have to go through the newbie thing again. <br />You should cetainly go to the resolution centre. they may not be able to help but it worth a try. The only reason vendors ask you to finalise early is because your new and have no buying stats. Also they will normally only send a small ammount. The fact he was prepaird to send you an Oz (or at least look as though he was) Is very suspect.... In my &quot;opinion&quot; he had every intention of scamming you from the start.<br />I know its to late now, but in the future until you have got at least 5 successfull purchases under your belt, only buy small ammounts. After you reached 5 purchases,&nbsp; !!! DO NOT FINALISE EARLY FOR NO VENDOR OR ANY REASON !!!<br /><br />I really hope you get your money back and please dont be put off SR because of this. <br />As always, there will be certain indeviduals who will scam, cheat and lie. Spoiling it for the rest... But remember !!!<br />This is a community of awesome people and awsome things, where everyone is quick to help and pull together out so you can benefit from a true open market. <br /><br />Stay safe,<br /><br />Sainsburys

				I&#039;ve never heard of a situation where someone FE&#039;d and received their product. AS long as you dont FE, you&#039;re safe. If you FE, your fuKed.

				you FE, you don&#039;t have a leg to stand on. SR resolution won&#039;t help you because you disregarded the safeguard of the escrow system which is in place to prevent situations like this. live and learn. hope it wasn&#039;t a big order..<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124481.msg852895#msg852895">Quote from: anonymousfakeuser3 on February 23, 2013, 08:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve never heard of a situation where someone FE&#039;d and received their product.

				Damn, what a pickle! Ive seen this vendor advertising. Whilst with some repituble vendors who ask for FE with new users (understandably so) i dont believe there is any justification in asking ALL CUSTOMERS to FE, pure and simple! This screams danger left, right and centre. Still, speak to him, see if he comes good! With any luck he will! Lesson learnt for next time! DG
