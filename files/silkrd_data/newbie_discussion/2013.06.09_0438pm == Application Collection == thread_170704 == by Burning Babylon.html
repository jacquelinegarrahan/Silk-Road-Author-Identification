				This thread will have the purpose of describing my current Application Collection, what applications are in it and what their purpose is. Feel free to post comments, your own collections or just useful stand alone applications. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve divided my Application Collection into six subcategories, namely:<br /><br />* General<br />* ISO<br />* Multimedia<br />* Security<br />* Simplistic<br />* System<br /><br />----------<br /><br />* General<br /><br />* Adobe Acrobat 3D. v8.10: Just for opening PDF documents, I find the new versions too bloated so I use an old one.<br />* Apache Open Office. v3.4.1. English: Alternative to Microsoft Office, for documents/excel files and so on.<br />* DAEMON Tools Lite. v4.47.1.0333: For mounting ISO files as a virtual DVD drive.<br />* Electrum. v1.8: A very easy to use Bitcoin-client.<br />* FileZilla. v3.7.0.2: FTP-client and server.<br />* Firefox. v21.0. English: A web browser alternative to Internet Explorer.<br />* ImgBurn. v2.5.7.0: An application for burning ISO files to CD/DVDs.<br />* MultiBit. v0.5.11: A Bitcoin client which is slightly more advanced than Electrum, however also misses some interesting functions of Electrum.<br />* Radmin. v3.4: Remote control application.<br />* UltraISO Premium. v9.5.3.2901: Application used for opening and editing ISO files mostly.<br /><br />* ISO<br /><br />* Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007. Blue Edition. English: My favorite version of Microsoft Office which includes almost all document editing applications.<br />* Microsoft Office Visio Professional 2007. English: Process editing application, mainly used by business to create process overviews to explain advanced systems more easily to those not involved in them directly.<br />* Ophcrack. No Tables. Live CD. v3.6.0: Live CD for cracking Windows passwords, without tables.<br />* Ophcrack. Vista - Windows 7. Live CD. v3.6.0: Live CD for cracking Windows Vista and Windows 7 passwords.<br />* Ophcrack. XP. Live CD. v3.6.0: Live CD for cracking Windows XP passwords.<br />* SmartDraw 2008: Process editing application, somewhat similar to Microsoft Office Visio.<br />* Tails. i386. v0.18: Live CD/DVD for running an operating system straight from a disc.<br />* Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 English. murphy78 2013 May: The Windows 7 ISO disc I use for my Windows Install.<br />* Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x86 English. murphy78 2013 May: The Windows 7 ISO disc I keep around to use on VMWare Workstation for emulating an operating system.<br />* VMware Workstation. v9.0.2.1031769: Application used to virtually emulate operating systems, can be used to test new applications or more securely do various things without getting compromised.<br /><br />* Multimedia<br /><br />* ACDSee Pro. v2.5.363: My favorite image viewer program, it&#039;s an older version which isn&#039;t as bloated as the new ones.<br />* Boilsoft Video Splitter. v7.02.2: Used for cutting segments of videos, use it mainly to crop out interesting YouTube-videos.<br />* Combined Community Codec Pack. v2013-05-30: My preferred Codec Pack, can play almost any video-format without issues.<br />* dBpoweramp Music Converter. Release 14.4 Reference Edition: Used for ripping and converting audio files to different formats.<br />* FastStone Image Viewer. v4.8: An alternative image viewer program to ACDSee Pro, has an easy to use function for removing Exif-information from camera images.<br />* foobar2000. v1.2.6: A music program, mostly as an alternative to Winamp as I feel it has a more advanced ID3-tag editing capability.<br />* Jasc Paint Shop Pro. v9.0: Image editing application, a very old version as the new ones are just worse in comparison.<br />* TechSmith Camtasia Studio. v8.0.1.903: Used for recording anything onscreen, will be used for creating video tutorials at a later date.<br />* Winamp Pro. v5.63.3235: My favorite music listening program at the moment.<br />* VLC. v2.0.6: Used for video viewing, mostly an alternative if I run across some very peculiar video format.<br /><br />* Security<br /><br />* Comodo Internet Security. v6.1.276867.2813: A combined anti-virus and firewall-package, useful sometimes.<br />* gpg4usb. v0.3.2-1: A GPG client which can be run without an install, the most important traits are it&#039;s easy to use and you can actually paste passwords, which you can&#039;t in GPG4win.<br />* GPG4win. v2.1.1: The most advanced PGP client for Windows as far as I&#039;m aware, works decently but pinentry (the subapplication used for entering your password) has by programming choice disabled copy-paste for passwords which makes it unusable for anything else than creating new keys and such.<br />* HijackThis. v2.0.5: Used for analyzing mostly if there&#039;s any applications/viruses that have somehow infected your system, can generate reports that others can use to help analyze.<br />* Jitsi. v2.2.4603.9615: Chat and video program which has the capability of encrypting both text and video. Might not be as functional as Skype yet, but on the other hand the data isn&#039;t logged by the NSA either.<br />* KeePass. v2.22: Master Password Manager, useful for keeping track of very long and complicated passwords.<br />* Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro. v1.75.0.1300: As the name implies used for removing malware and other unwanted intrusions in your system.<br />* Passware Password Recovery Kit Professional. v11.1.4: Password cracking for most Office type documents and a few other formats aswell.<br />* PC Tools Password Utilities. v1.0.0.5: Password Generating Utility.<br />* QFX KeyScrambler Premium. v3.1.0.0: Scrambles all keyboard entries into random data which would make any keylogger record the random data and be of no use. Will not protect against hardware keyloggers.<br />* Tor Browser Bundle. v2.3.25-8: Tor Browser Bundle used for surfing on sites like Silk Road.<br />* TrueCrypt. v7.1a: Encryption program for files or partitions/hard drives, can be used to encrypt the whole system disk so you can&#039;t gain access to it at all without the correct pass. Worth keeping in mind is the active TrueCrypt key is stored in the RAM when the computer is on if you have system encryption, and it will be removed 5-15 minutes after the computer is turned off. This technically means Law Enforcement can if they are proficient enough remove your RAM, cool it down significantly so the data lasts longer and extract your key from the memory.<br /><br />* Simplistic<br /><br />* f.lux: A must have application for controlling the light sensitivity on screen, regulates according with what time of the day it is.<br />* Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder. v2.0.9.8: Shows your current Windows License Key.<br />* Mp3tag. v2.55a: Used to edit tags on Mp3-files.<br />* Process Explorer. v15.3: A more advanced version of the Windows Task Manager for Processes.<br />* Regshot. v1.9.0: A before and after snapshot-utility of the Windows Registry, useful for seeing what kind of changes an application does after being installed.<br />* ReNamer. v5.70: A mass-file-renaming utility.<br />* TreeCopy. v1.11: Used for copying all folder structures of any given folder but not copying any files at all.<br />* WhatChanged. v1.07: A before and after snapshot-utility very similar to Regshot, but slightly different.<br />* WinDirStat. v1.1.2: Used to give a presentation on exactly where all the files on your hard drive are.<br />* Windows 7 USB-DVD Download Tool. v8.00.7600.16385: Mainly used for burning Windows ISO files to USB memory sticks.<br /><br />* System<br /><br />* 2BrightSparks SyncBackPro. v6.3.13.0: Backup utility.<br />* Active@ File Recovery v.10.0.8: File-recovery application, can be used to recover deleted files which haven&#039;t been overwritten yet (these types of applications are used by Law Enforcement).<br />* Active@ Partition Recovery. v8.0.0: Partition-recovery application, in case the partition table gets messed up.<br />* AIDA32. v3.94.2: Used for giving useful information about the computer.<br />* EASEUS Partition Master. v9.1.0 Professional Edition: A partition manager program.<br />* HashCheck. v2.1.11: A MD5-haschecker, the best one I know of currently but there are certainly things that could be improved.<br />* HDD Capacity Restore. v.1.2: Has the capacity to sometimes repair a corrupt partition table, not used very often but it has saved me atleast once previously.<br />* Lavalys EVEREST Ultimate Edition. v5.30.1900: Used for giving useful information about the computer, and some benchmarking capabilities.<br />* RARLAB WinRAR. v4.20 (32-bit): The 32-bit version which is used for compressing and opening various storage formats like RAR.<br />* RARLAB WinRAR. v4.20 (64-bit): The 64-bit version which is used for compressing and opening various storage formats like RAR<br />* UltraDefrag. v6.0.2: Used for defragmenting fragmented hard drives.<br />* WinAudit. v2.29: Used for giving useful information about the computer, very similar to AIDA32 but slightly different<br /><br />This is valid as of today ( 2013-06-09 ) and some applications occasionally get updated, while others do not.&nbsp; :P
