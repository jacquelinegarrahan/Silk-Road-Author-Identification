				so i thought i understood the philosophy behind the karma ratings for each forum member&#039;s profile. but out of nowhere over the past few weeks, i have received 3 points, not all positive. so i went back and looked at my posts. i couldn&#039;t find any breach of rules. there was one post that had no replies so i removed it thinking that was problem. next day, i have another -point. shrug. i am generally positive and try to be helpful when i see someone asking for help on a subject i had also experienced. other than that i use the forums as a place to find out what is going on and as a resource for keeping the market and myself safe. so my questions are: how are points given? who has karma giving privileges? is there any information that can be attained as a result, such as an explanation on why points were given? does it really matter? because if it does, i.e. the point system serving as a meter on which to determine if one&#039;s contribution holds any weight at all, then i would like to have more information on how the system works, how to prevent abuse of the system if it exists, and how to make sure that the system accomplishes its intended purposes.
