				Hey there new to SR <br /><br />I have an honest question im not trying to troll or anything im just confused a little about the prices of everything on here, i understand the BC exchange but i jut don&#039;t understand why everything is so expensive? Is everything here pure uncut of the highest quality or is it another reason?<br /><br />The only reason i ask is thongs like an 8th 3.5gm of brown here is only £100 but i keep finding things like only a gram for prices like £75 which would be £262 for an 8th <br /><br />Can someone please explain why things are a lot more in price here so i can make wise purchases<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; :)

				Prices reflect what the market will bear, not indicators of some hellfire quality.<br /><br />If you can buy so much cheaper, then consider it.&nbsp; &nbsp;buy low, sell high

				Also quality has to be factored aswell.<br />Maybe the grams you&#039;re looking at are nowhere near the quality of the 8th?

				I just posted on this topic - ir&#039;s an unregulated digital currency. To bake it down it simple terms the more people want drugs and services on SR or BMR the higher the btc rate will be. I started in late March 2012 as a buyer &amp; the value was 4btc&#039;s - an almost 4X uptick in 1 year - trending around 15 this evening

				Prices on some stuff, like MDMA, weed, or mushrooms, is pretty good. It&#039;s all a function of how many are selling vs. ho many are buying and what market conditions are in your area. Pot prices in the US South are obscene, as in $70/eighth. In Colorado, it&#039;s $25. SR has as low as $35.
