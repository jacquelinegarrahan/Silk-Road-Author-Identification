				I&#039;ve made 3 purchases on SR so far. First one got it in 2 days. Great experience. Never received second one. Although I FE&#039;d, I received a refund which took a month. Third time bought of PE and that looks quite hopeless.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m getting to is asking if there are better vendors on Atlantis or SR. How is the prevelance of scamming? Unchanged? <br /><br />I am sick of wasting my money and not getting anything in return.<br /><br />I understand some fault lies with me. Especially in the case of planet express but other than that I see a lot of people claiming scam on here and I was wondering if Atlantis was any better.<br /><br />Thanks for the input.

				Both sites have their pro&#039;s and con&#039;s... I personally prefer SR because there is a much larger variety to choose from, many more products, and many more vendors. Although Atlantis has a nicer interface, many think it is more of a &quot;honey hole&quot; (more feds on the site). I would say that it is easier to scam on Atlantis due to the lower seller&#039;s bond and things of that nature. However, since there are so many more users and listings on SR there are more scammers. I would guess that the &quot;rate of scamming&quot; is lower on SR if that makes sense. (More products + harder to scam = less scams per transactions)

				There&#039;s going to be bad actors/vendors on any site, but overall, Silk Road has my trust as a &quot;mall&quot;. The vendors are the stores. There can be bad stores even in the swanky new mall.

				Thank you everyone, I appreciate your feedback!<br /><br />I think it&#039;s my fault for looking for cheap prices as opposed to seller rating so it seems I&#039;ll have to be more careful but it looks like I&#039;ll stay here then:)<br /><br />

				I have made 6 orders on SR and 3 on Atlantis, Both seem ok, just do lots of research on vendors before ordering. I think Atlantis has a nicer layout, shows $USD amounts for listing instead of BTC, so I don&#039;t have to keep doing conversions in my head.

Also while there is less overall users on Atlantis the better feedback system and smaller amount traffic means we are much more responsive in dealing with scammers such as PlannetExpress when they do show up. <br />The last vendor who went &quot;rogue&quot; a few weeks back got away with a grand total of 2 FE orders for $75 each before being banned meaning they earned a whopping $50 before time and expenses for their hard work creating the account/listings and fake feedback.<br /><br />Remember SR is the bigger barrel but that also means there&#039;s more shit in the bottom of it :)
