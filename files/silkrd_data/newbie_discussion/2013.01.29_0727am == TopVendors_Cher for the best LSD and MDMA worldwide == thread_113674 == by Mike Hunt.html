				Cher&#039;s vendor page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7542f20f81<br /><br />Forum Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178338.0<br /><br />I&#039;m very proud to promote a new shining star of a vendor to our community. Please visit Cher&#039;s vendor page if you want to experience the best LSD I&#039;ve ever had and to top it off the prices are very affordable at ninety two bux for a ten strip with 130 to 160 ug of the cleanest purest needlepoint LSD there is. There are a few vendors here selling good LSD and I think that Cher will be at the top of that list soon<br /><br />Shipping was quick and stealthy. Coming from another country it got to me in 4 days! The stealth was adequate with some minor improvements to be made and when a couple of us samplers spoke to her about it she ensured us that it would be taken care of and I believe her.<br /><br />I had a very interesting night last night candy flipping the mdma and LSD. This mdma was some of the prettiest mdma chunks I ever saw. Translucent rocks with some cloudiness to them. They almost looked a little damp but it was really the way they shined and sparkled. My half gram weighed .500 right on the nose.<br /><br />I took 200 mg as that is my favorite dose and I can judge mdma fairly close at that dose.&nbsp; It had the anise smell to it and tasted like strong pure mdma. It had the &quot;bright&quot; bitter taste to it. It took only about thirty minutes for the come up to start with lots of empathy. It was very smooth no anxiety but rather more feelings of love and kinship with the world.<br /><br />At the 2 hour mark my eyes were fully dilated as the roll was getting much more intense. Any kind of music I heard made me want to dance and I could not keep completely still while music was playing. This is the hardest I&#039;ve ever rolled on 200mg of mdma. Cher&#039;s mdma has set the bar even higher and I got 300 mg left. I continued to roll hard until the 4 hour mark and that&#039;s when I decided to drop one out of 2 hits of LSD she gave me.<br /><br />The Avatar LSD Tab<br />This was my first time ever with &quot;candy flipping&quot;. I had seen it talked about a few times in various forums including this one but never really thought much about it because in my opinion LSD and mdma each by themselves is plenty to get a good buzz from and I rarely have them both in my possession at the same but time but here it is my opportunity to experience candy flipping for myself.<br /><br />After 30 minutes I was blown away by how fast I started feeling the LSD. I first I started feeling that everything lightened up. For example I felt no weight in my body and mind. It felt like cool water was running from my head to my toes. The environment and atmosphere began to look different to my perception. A definite shift in reality was taking place.<br /><br />With in the 2 hour mark after chewing on the blotter and then swallowing it I was really tripping balls like never before and the trip was such an awesome &quot;good&quot; trip I wanted it to last forever. It was like I was in outer space or something. Everything appeared to be floating objects. The walls were no longer present. As I walked through the house everything that was hanging on walls or setting on the floors appeared to be floating objects. <br /><br />4 hours into it I decided I wanted to go outside and do some exploring. I had such a great feeling of well being and energy. As I explored outside in the yard I layed down on the grass and gazed at the sky. I didn&#039;t care that the ground was wet it actually felt great as O lay there tripping out on the stars and clouds. Watching the clouds morph into different shapes gave me so much euphoria it was great. The night time for tripping is pretty cool with all the mysteries of the darkness to play with.<br /><br />When I came back in 2 hours had passed. I changed my clothes and kicked back and found some comedies to watch on the tube. I found an old Eddie Murphy stand up routine I think it was &quot;Raw&quot;. With each time he did an impression of someone, he became that person right before my eyes. It was so funny and I laughed so much my jaws were hurting when I awoke today. I remember it was at the 8 hour mark when I finally crashed out and I was still tripping pretty hard seeing aura&#039;s and triple outlines on things<br /><br />In a nutshell, I&#039;ll be buying my future mdma and lsd from Cher and you would be to if you knew what I know now. Thank you very much Cher for sharing with me and for vending your fine products here at Silk Road<br /><br />10/10 on everything I&#039;ll be back to visit Cher&#039;s store soon and I still got my hit of Gandolf LSD and 300 mg of MDMA. Hell Yea!!<br /><br /><br />

				I have picked out my best vendors for the Domestic US (short wait) and ill go international for the best LSD..<br /><br />Yes, the feedback and (stat) is very important, but for me, especially as far as LSD goes, (after being ripped off by EntertheMatrix at my first buy)you need to do much, much more.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found you have to go all out. Read all the threads about them, read the experiences and trip reports and look for consistency. Also you have to have to SEVERAL conversations with the vendor(s) you&#039;re looking at, you have to talk to the buyers personally, and dont EVER sleep on the LSD Avengers&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=45270.0 these guys are very helpful and honest.<br /><br />Just talk to the different top LSD vendors when you&#039;ve established who they are.<br /><br />I&#039;ve realized there are about 8 vendors that have pure LSD. Only two (Tessellated 200ug+ doses and LucyDrop 100ug+ doses)<br /><br />These peeps are active and loaded, but the others will always have regular postings. So when you&#039;re gonna drop a decent amount in the SR for LSD, do all that research, bc I found there is a TON of bullshit out there on SR and its mostly pertaining to crappy/fake doses of LSD.<br /><br />Know anyone giving samples of respectable reputation?<br /><br />roth

				Yeah Mike, first post from this username.lol<br />Your thread just catched my eye.<br />There should be more threads like yours with good and bad vendors list.<br />Keep us in the loop and please do not forget to look from both buyer and vendor perspective.Trust goes both way, one negative fb can ruin honest vendor. DCN have US and what about the rest of the country who do not. If buyer has a concerns then he should go somewhere else. There is a ton more buyers then vendors on SR, who do a selective scams as well (what is almost never published on the forum so most of members are not even aware of it) - its a statistical fact.<br />Buyers should also earn their reputation like vendors. Honest vendors without dcn option would like to hear a solution of false delivery claims. There should be at least benefit of doubt based on vendor reputation.

				That&#039;s strange.<br />Googleyed resent a package straight away when I let them know it arrived under half-weight.<br />The package that got reshipped never arrived and I assume got lost in the holiday mail.<br />To my surprised he reshipped a 3rd package which arrived just today. <br />Went out of his way to make sure the original order was the right weight; where I&#039;ve had other vendors who wouldn&#039;t even talk to me when I told them the package didn&#039;t arrive.<br /><br />Is that awakened you&#039;re trying for mxe? I&#039;ve heard good things about him, but I went with Tunbear first and he resolved my problem similarly.<br />Order 1g off him and only received .5g He quickly sent a reship and when it arrived it was a full 1g, so he let me keep the 1/2g for free.<br /><br />Good customer service when shit hits the fan is real important to me. Especially for international orders.

It would be more convenient if it were a sticky. I&#039;d be willing to change the avatar since I will be anyway and I&#039;m also thinking about a rotation for multiple top of list vendors which will be mostly the latest reviews. Those vendors will have the option of looking at it after I finish and suggesting changes such as a different way to word out their pitch. On the other hand they will have the option of writing their own paragraph for me to add to the top along with their name in the title for a certain amount of time. Right now it&#039;s who ever&#039;s product comes first but as I make more at my job then there will be many more transaction hence more reviews. Basically I am offering this thread so new folks can see from the horses mouth who is a legit vendor they can trust. The part that&#039;s &quot;kind of on the side&quot; is each vendor I try will be at the top of the list as long as our deal is legit and smooth.<br /><br />I would be honored if they made this a sticky to say the least my face would turn blood red cause I&#039;m shy <br /><br />I will also be changing up the polls frequently and adding contest for free goods. Does anyone have any ideas how to do something like that as a non vendor?&nbsp; I can offer gift codes as prizes or? anyone?&nbsp; I&#039;d love to have a vendor talk to me about this. Maybe if I had one who could give a gift code for half off a product maybe and then have some contest for the best review of the same product. I am just brainstorming but yes It sound very do-able <br /><br />As I put more into this it seems to be feeding for more as well. Just thinking that I will be adding vendors to the list that have stellar stats even if I have never tried out their gear or done any business with them at all. It&#039;s only right if I am to offer a good service is to do the complete job so maybe once a month I will add the best rated vendors according to Silk Road stats or something like that so any ideas would be helpful

				The Top Shelf has some great SLH but the price went up slightly from the last time I purchased. Still fair based on the quality I received. <br /><br />In your poll I would have selected - if reward outweighs the risk. I think a few vendors get burned by unsavory buyers from time to time and it can really hurt their rating. Now if someone was at 85-90% I probably wouldn&#039;t buy a lb from them but a gram or so at a good price/strain, sure. How else are they going to get some more transactions back to make up for the scammer? Be weary but use your spider senses. <br /><br />It&#039;s all about what you are comfortable gambling with. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, just don&#039;t bet more than you can afford.

I&#039;ve not looked in a while but I currently have over 100 and something transactions with the account I primarily use right now. I will be going thru them and hopefully it will let me go back as far as when I started but I doubt it. I think it goes back just 2 months? But I am not a big bulky buyer and it&#039;s for personal use so don&#039;t fault me for that.

				yes you can&#039;t go wrong with Tyl3r but be sure to read his vendor page so you will be well informed about any new policies he may have. He is possibly the best vendor on the road. He is quick to reply to all his messages and to fix any problems that may arise. I only ask that you treat him with courtesy and by doing so you are guaranteed to receive the most professional treatment possible. Tyl3r is a very hard working vendor and has many clients therefore he is very busy.

				I started reading this thread and though it might be a good idea to make multiple threads for specific substances. It just seems that there is a potential for this to turn into a clusterfuck of information, albeit good information. Don&#039;t think I&#039;m trying to flame anybody, we need more threads like this. Check this heroin thread out:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94564.0;topicseen<br /><br />...to see what I mean. Even though there are vendors who have reviews in the thread that sell things other than H, it is strictly for H reviews. I just think doing something like this would make the info EVEN EASIER to sift through.

				thanks for posting and I can see where your coming from. There are threads for specific drugs in the rumor mill.<br /><br />I created this thread in the new buyers section to help them find credible vendors and to help new vendors and old ones to find new buyers.<br /><br />Even tho I have quite the list of vendors i have tried, the most latest and the ones that are being promoted at the present time are featured in the title of this thread for a number of days along with their review at the top of page one with their links. <br /><br />I am offering a bitcoin to the winner of the best review in CanadianForger&#039;s free samples of mdma and I am not involved at all. CF is matching it with a coin of his own so the winner will get 2 bit coin. The winner is the one with the most votes by the community.<br /><br />In the second post I keep an updated list of best vendors according to SR.<br /><br />This thread is more about credible vendors then specific drugs because the new members who can&#039;t post anywhere but here have a hard time learning the ropes and sifting for hours using the TOR slow ass browser so this list lets them check out credible vendors for different needs. <br /><br />Even tho I am in the states and so my international vendors are fewer I am going to start adding reviews from credible reviewers of international vendors who wont ship to the states. I&#039;ll be holding a lot more contest so I can find awesome reviews worth listing in this thread. <br /><br />As far as Heroin vendors go I have used tomorrow man when he sold coke but now he has great reviews for his H. And I can more then vouch for his honesty and stealthy shipping.<br /><br />By creating this thread I give vendors another outlet to promote theirselves and to the newest buyers no less.<br /><br />I want this thread to be a sticky but don&#039;t know how to do that. As you can see it&#039;s a unique thread in itself apart from those threads that specialize in one certain drug. This thread is to help credible vendors find new buyers. The new buyers are in awe when they first discover the road and they really don&#039;t know what they want yet so this thread also let&#039;s them see what&#039;s available and who to get it from that&#039;s got a good history as a vendor.<br /><br />New buyers can always look at the rumor mill threads but they can only post here until 50 post count is reached thus keeping them here where they will see this thread with certain drugs and vendor names in the title. When I review these vendors I post that review here and in multiple rumor mill threads and product offer threads. I help promote these guys. I actually put in a little effort and have a good reason why I should review your products other then just wanting a &quot;freebie&quot; like a lot of folks. I give you a real motive for me to review a vendors product and the vendor sees results in the form of more sales and fanns and interested buyers.<br /><br />I also leave a long honest detailed review on the SR feedback as well. check me out on sr with my name ralph2341542<br /><br />I been here over a year under different names and I have 129 transactions with 0% refunds and 0% auto finalize. I did not just throw this thread together in a day. I played the game and learned the ropes and felt the energy and then figured out a plan for this thread then finally started it. <br /><br />

If you ever need any help, let me know, I&#039;m all about making this as legitimate/honest of a marketplace as it can be, and would be willing to dedicate as much time as my RL schedule permits(work, responsibilities &amp; such.)

				Hey folks check out page one to see the latest addition to my Top Rated Vendors List. I love the Silk Road and I love this community. I promote these vendors because they work really hard to bring us their fantastic products. They have to buy a vendors account, spend time getting everything set up and listed, then they have to spend money and time to get our packages ready with vac seal and stealthy measures.<br /><br />Vendors there are ways to get on my list and have your name and products featured in the title of this thread. Send me a small sample at a small price or free. Or just be patient and I&#039;ll get around to buying your product. Or when I&#039;m going thru a dry spell with no funds or samples to review I will search for a worthy review and feature it. It&#039;s important to me to update this thread as often as possible with new reviews.<br /><br />I place my reviews in multiple threads like the proper rumor mill threads, the vendors threads, and this thread and when I see people looking for product I throw in the vendor and his SR link for that product. I am a promoter and I strive to find buyers for vendors and I also promote reviewers that give great reviews. <br /><br />Guys without the administrators and moderators we would have no place like this to hook up with vendors all over the world so when your down to spare change not enough to buy anything and your getting more coin anyway why not donate it to the moderators and administrators? You know when ever you buy something in your area how many times have you had to break a little off for the middle man?<br /><br />That&#039;s it for my words of wisdom today. Have a great experience using Silk Road and this community. I am sending positive energy to each and every one of you.

I took over this account at a time when the account had reached an incredibly low 40% feedback. I feel that no account is beyond recovery and am now working hard on keeping my customers happy and working my way back up to the high 90s. Over the last 2 weeks, I have taken this account from 40% to 65%, which i personally think i a step in the right direction. As you can see, the feedback since i have taken lead has been 100% positive and I only work within escrow, so no early finalization. You orders are, and always will be safe.<br />The best way to contact me is on here, SR can be slow to access sometimes, while these forums are quick and easy to contact each other on.

I turned on some of my buddies with it and they prefer the IV method and said they wanted more and to check out the prices for them. So I&#039;m thinking that #30 a G will allow me to make a little from it and I know it would make my own personal stash free for me plus pocket a buck or 2. 5/5 on quality. This substance is a fluffy snow white fine powder and requires no crushing but just use a credit card to chop it up a bit and drag up a 70 to 100 mg line for extreme euphoria that last about 2 hours with some after glow effects for 2 hours later. It does burn at first but it&#039;s not near as bad as snorting ice and the burn only last about 5 or 10 seconds but that&#039;s me you know? I am a snorter and have been for a while.<br /><br />My buddies tried it as a speedball by mixing it with some xanax and injecting it. They came back over after 30 minutes talking out their asses. Lol don&#039;t worry I showed them about the info on it so they knew what they were getting into and loved it. They said it made one hell of a speedball buzz by IVing it. I like it just fine snorting it. When I first got it I insufflated 50 mg and 15 minutes later the euphoria was very noticeable.<br /><br />5/5 for stealth inconspicuous quick shipping and better then vac seal in my opinion. Thanks for putting all that info in there with it. It blended in with my other regular mail beautifully and considering where it came from plus having to go thru a Sunday this was really fast for regular snail mail. I wish some of my priority shipments would come this fast. Good labels also but maybe using a fake business address would be an improvement? But maybe not so don&#039;t fix it if it&#039;s not broken.<br /><br />I got three very generous samples from FiberOptic. 500 mg of 4-FMA , 500 mg of 4-FA, and 250 mg of 2-FMA and all three of them weighed right on the nose thank you 5/5 <br /><br />The 2-FMA looks kind of like the 4-FMA with a fluffy snow white look to it. The 4-FA weighs hevier making the 500 mg look like a smaller amount but it weighs .5 on my scales and it&#039;s not fluffy or snow white. When I hold it up next to the others it looks like an off white maybe egg shell color. I&#039;ve only tried the 4-FMA so far and so I&#039;ll be back to post my experience with the other 2 on a different day when I&#039;m completely sober so I can get an accurate review written.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This 4-FMA has a great euphoric buzz to it without any nervousness or jitters to it. It&#039;s a good clean stimulant in my honest opinion and FiberOptic is a great addition to Silk Road. Go check out his reviews which just started pouring in from his free samples.<br /><br />Reviews<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=122539.0

Stealthy enough to get here un scaved and perfectly in tact. I admit that I have seen some vendors with better stealth techniques but I am 2 for 2 with Liston so far and could not be happier with any other vendor. <br /><br />This Guy is one of my best SR assets now. A real find. I am so glad to have this new hook up for 2mg xanax bars. Prices are so unbelievably great that Liston will take over the Xanax market at SR. My latest sample pack had some free blue V-cut Roche valumes in it again. Nice! I am thinking about trying his MDMA. It&#039;s at a really great price. Liston has 2 pages of products listed for sale.<br /><br />Communications is always great with Liston because he always gets right back to you with in an hour or 2 at the latest but it&#039;s usually with in 20 minutes. I sure am glad I stumbled upon this new vendor during this &quot;up and coming time&quot; for his vendorship. Now he is taking the Road by storm.&nbsp; <br /><br />5/5 for the quality of these Xanax bars. They are white with Xanax written on one side and a big 2 on the other. They have break cuts on them so you can break off .05 doses at a time like a peach football. Everyone That I&#039;ve shared with always comes back for more with only good things to say. I insufflated just one section equivalent to a peach football and it did me just like xanaxes do and so I know personally that the quality is on par and the Blue Roche V&#039;s are better then any V&#039;s I have ever had.<br /><br />I know his popularity is growing by looking at his SR feedback and seeing that he is getting feedback pretty much every hour or less so if I was hunting a good source for product I would look this vendor over and if he&#039;s got what you want then give him a try. I promise you will be greatly satisfied. It&#039;s vendors like Liston that make SR a great place to full fill your needs. He&#039;s one of the great ones and I look for him to be around here for a long time. Long live Liston and the Silk Road Marketplace!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

They are the beige ones with AD on one side and a big 30 on the other. I verified them using a random pill identifier and they checked out.&nbsp; So I grind ed one down and made two fat lines for me and a friend to rail. To me they taste a lot like the orange 30&#039;s and the effects started kicking in with after 5 minutes and they feel like they are fresh as hell because the energy I got from that one line lasted all day so I would verify that these are authentic RX quality meds. <br /><br />It looks like Cimicon is really going the extra mile to win back the support of the community.

				hey chil what&#039;s up? Yea after doing some of Haizenberg&#039;s MDMA crystals I have my doubt about purity from other vendors. There are a lot of chemicals out there that give off the same effects but are just slightly different but not really that noticeable if it was added to the real thing and also a home test kit would show up for MDMA if&nbsp; say you got a gram from a vendor and he put cut into but it still had some mdma in it. I just did some 4FA and it was a lot like mdma and tasted the same too with the same euphoria and dilated eyes. The difference is it takes more of it to last longer. I did 360 mg and it lasted about 4 or 5 hours but that&#039;s considered to big of a dose. <br /><br />The real MDMA will thirst you to death and may even cause cramping the next day

				Hey Mike, indeed, Haizenberg&#039;s molly got me way more thirsty than any other M I&#039;ve gotten here. I don&#039;t have an experience with mdma to the point of being able to identify possible cuts, but I could definitely tell Haiz shit was among the best. Never had next-day cramping, just jaw-clenching sometimes up to a week after. Too bad many people stick with their usual supplier, they should at least try once ordering from Haizenberg. <br /><br />Which Mdma did you get by the way, 85 or 87 ? <br /><br />edit: oh, easy on the 4FA bro, it appears to be highly neurotoxic: <br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=175262

				+1 chil for posting that link. Yea safety should be priority number one. I know that all amphetamines are toxic to the brain but that link has info telling how 4FA and the othe FA type chems are at a much higher risk of brain damage then MDMA. <br /><br />MDMA is a really fun substance and besides the tolerance issues, you have show my readers another reason to use it in moderation. Once a month is actually not a bad idea. Others have said 3 times a year. So if vendors are adding Substances like 4FA as a cutting agen then it is so important to find vendors who aren&#039;t using any cutting agents.<br /><br />With that being said I highly recommend Haizenberg above all other MDMA vendors. If you read some of the magor vendors review threads then you will see a lot of people buying bulk and most of them are American vendors who buy bulk and then sell grams or capsules. Who knows how many of them are using cutting agents to increase their profits.

Thank You.... to CF!!, for making the sample a whole Gram. That is alot, and SUPER Generous of him, which I Appreciate ALOT!<br /><br />Thanks a ton bud!!!<br /><br /><br />Shipping- 5/5------- Ultra Fast International shipping. I ordered it on Sunday. The vendor shipped it on Monday. I received my product on Thursday. Took 4 days Total, to East Coast from Canada International. Beyond fast and Awesome. <br /><br />Packaging- 5/5--------- Very good packaging. Very stealthy packaging. Even If opened by customs , they would have no clue, and keep things rollin. I recommend to vacuum seal all of your products. I’m sure it was just not necessary for my 1 gram sample. For those big orders, it is very necessary, especially when going through International customs. Packaging is great, with the awesome disguise. Professional, with a smile.<br /><br />Communication- 5/5--------- CF answered all my questions. He responded to my messages within few hours. He is very nice guy to communicate with. Fantastic.<br />&nbsp;<br />Product Characteristics- 5/5--------- The product consisted of powdered crystals. It wasn’t powder, but very fine crushed crystals. Feels like less then sand, but very nice, as you can see the crystals, with few the size of tiny pebbles. It looks like it was washed pretty good, white colour with maybe 20% of Tan colour to. The product looks very good and clean.<br /><br />Product Quality- 5/5--------- I think it was good product. It’s not the best I had, but still got me rolling pretty good. I haven’t done any MDMA in 2 weeks, so my tolerance should be at medium. I consumed about 450-500 mg that night, and got an alright high. I usually roll on 360 mg max I didn’t have a micro scale so I had to eye ball this stuff. I consumed about 125-150mg at first. <br />It took about 60 minutes to kick in, slightly longer than usual. I didn’t eat before, like I usually doo. The high started off with a tingle sensation running through the head, and then elevated euphoria and empathy. My pupils were dilated. My eyes were definite vibrating hardcore, because I was seeing foggy everywhere. The jaw clinch wasn’t too bad on me, better then ever, until I was peeking though.<br /><br />Music appreciate was increased, but not that much. I wasn’t cracked out high and wired, I felt good body wise, I was just chill and very calm, slowed down. It was a bit chilly and wearing a hoodie, was the best idea ever, very nice and cosy. It was making me relax and enjoy comfort. The empathy wasn’t much there. Made me smile and feel great, but I didn’t love everything like normal. <br /><br />The rap music was alright, but techno music sounded better, that was different. Later on I tried to do glow sticks in my face to the music, but there was no trails happening, so I gave up.&nbsp; After initial dose, I started to consume about 75 mg every few hours, to keep things rolling. So 450-500mg lasted about 8 hours, kept me rolling all night, which was great. I stayed very hydrated whole time, and I still woke up high. <br /><br />So I got very high, but felt different effect. It was great MDMA crystals though. Im not sure what batch I got, but CF definitely has new batches already. To me it felt like classic MDMA that I had from G’s Up Hoes Down pills back in the day, so I was pretty happy to have a different high. I still got the other half of the sample. I’m going to come back in few weeks and see if I feel different on the same batch.<br /><br />When I was washing my face, I had boiling hot water gong in the sink, and keeping the hands in hot water, then flipping to cold felt amazing. I wasn’t too fucked up, but at some points, I was cooking in my head pretty good.<br /><br />In conclusion - 5/5--------- I liked this MDMA, I had a good roll, and a fun time. I would recommend this product to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you want Clean and Great MDMA crystals, then…….. Canadian Forger!!!!!!!.........! is the vendor to go to.<br /><br /><br />Canadian Forger!!!!!!!! Thank You so much for letting me sample your product and write a review. You have a great product my friend.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do me a favor and tell them that Mike Hunt sent ya lol<br /><br />Great reviews for good great vendors.

				Yea I just pur the offer out there on the offers page so lets see if anyone replies. But doesn&#039;t it make more sense to use this in that way to get more business for vendors ? So that buyers could compete for some of there coin back? it would increase there reason for buying from them.<br /><br />Who here in this section wouyld like to have a contest for the best review with a prize of half a bit coin?

				Could you please post on the first page when you choose the best vendor for certain drug why you choose them.<br /><br />For instance you choose hammertime for the best meth vendor. Could you please put the date of when you made this decision and why. Are you going to update it from time to time? My point is this. At any given moment, someone is on the top when it comes to a certain drug. Just like anything in life. Things are constantly changing. So, i think being more specific as to why you personally choose hammertime would be beneficial. <br /><br />Now let me say this. Hammertime is a superb vendor. I was one of his first customers back in the day. (As you can tell i created his review thread.) He&#039;s great when it comes to packaging, shipping time, and is highly communicative. His product is superb when it comes to the asking price. So in a sense i would agree with you that hammertime is the best vendor for meth for the common user. His prices are very affordable even for the casual meth user. <br /><br />But, what about the meth enthusiast? A vendor that has good packaging, shipping time, and is very communicative is a must. But, what a enthusiast wants is the best quality they can acquire. So, the best meth vendor would be someone who can provide such product. <br /><br />So all I&#039;m saying is this. If you could please add a description to why you choose a certain vendor for a certain drug would be beneficial to your thread. This is an amazing thread and i really enjoy reading it! If there is anything i could do personally to contribute. Please let me know. Every time i come to this thread i give you another + karma. Keep up the amazing work!

This is amongst the best 3 times I have had the best pot in my life folks and I am creeping upon half a century here so that&#039;s saying something.<br /><br />Quality 10/10 all the way. This Grand Daddy Purple has me blown away! I gota say after trying TJ&#039;s GDP I am so highly impressed with this above medical grade AAAA qulaity marijuana I feel like I am wasting my money just looking at other vendors for weed. Thes nugs are dank and juicy. The shades of purple are unbelisvably beautiful. I would have loved being a half of a foot away from this plant. Just imagine pulling one of those purple buds up close to your nose and taking in it&#039;s heavenly fragrance. The word fruity does not give it justice. I think I am liking the purple strains the best. The first man sized hit and exhail had me forgetting that I was still holding the joint. Dynamite quality!<br /><br />Stealthy quick shipping for sure.&nbsp; I am so glad that there were so many layers of stealth even be4 the vac seal was revealed. At last after working a rubix cube type of stealth I got down to where it was zipped twice and the wreaking aroma hit me. I got it out of the zipps and OMFG what a delicious set of undamaged tightly dense heavenly buds. I got 5.01 on my scale but wait a second, I only ordered 4.5! So that&#039;s a big hell yea +1 Thanks Trader Joe and you get a 10/5 for the stealthy shipping and the weed being right on weight plus half a gram over.<br /><br />Last order I got from TJ took over a week. I knew this time would be an improvement but Dam! Don&#039;t worry TJ I am not expecting this lightening fast type of delivery every time. I really believe I got one of those lucky quicker then the speed of light deliveries this time. I am highly impressed with how fast this came from where it had to come from.<br /><br />5/5 for customer communications. Trader Joe is always answering my messages with in an hour or 2 usually but no longer then 6 to 8 hours if he&#039;s not online at the time. I am going to be adding Trader Joe to my thread in the newbies section in a few moments and bumping that thread to the front page 2 or 3 times a day to help the new members see where to get the best weed and best service and shipping on the domestic scene right now. Thanks TJ I&#039;ll be&nbsp; ordering again soon. The reason I haven&#039;t yet is because my bank is closed on the weekend .<br /><br />I would recommend Trader Joe to everyone who enjoys Gods Gift to us the holy plant. He&#039;s got grams listed right now for only&nbsp; .44 bit coin&nbsp; The Grand Daddy Purple has been a smashing success with everyone who&#039;s got to try it with me. I was going to try to flip a couple of G&#039;s but I could not part with it. I did sale a couple of ten dollar joints. Small Joints too. I rolled 4 joints from one gram. This weed is so fire I just want to nurse on it lol 2 or three hits go a long way. A buddy of mine had a bong and I threw a chunk in it with out breaking it up and we got high as hell from that. I would guess it was a quarter gram size chunk and the two of us hit it 3 or 4 times each huge bong hits that filled the room with smoke and the best floral purple smell ever.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Go to the review page and check out the contest where you can win half a bitcoin and a gram of the killer weed<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=125546.0----&gt;reviews<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/34a46ca91c---------&gt;SR page

I can only compare them to Maligan&#039;s Klonopin, but they were exactly the same in terms of potency.<br /><br />Overall 5/5: It seems like Cimicon has really stepped up their game. Everything was extremely smooth from the time I ordered to the time I received my product. At these prices, I really don&#039;t see any reason to go to anybody else for your klonopin needs :). It was a pleasure and I thank you for the sample, I will be ordering from you as long as you continue to stay reliable!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cimicon is going to great lengths to win back the confidence of the community.

				mainstay review<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=127294.0&nbsp; &nbsp;review thread<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/449d4f916e&nbsp; &nbsp;sr page<br />Ok guys I am exempt from this contest but my review is ready to be put up here in MainStay&#039;s thread so here goes.<br />.59 btc for an 1/8th<br />10/5 for the quick and stealthy shipping no doubt. I agree with what was said earlier about if it were opened that it would be shut back up and sent on it&#039;s merry way. My sr order page had 15 days left before auto finalize. How&#039;s that for quick high quality shrooms?<br /><br />10/5 or great customer communication. Main Stay answered my PM&#039;s about as fast as a vendor possibly could and I am very happy with his communication and his talkative nature. He is very smart and seems to be able feel what I was saying.<br /><br />10/5 for the weight being slightly over I got 3.74 on my scales. I thought that the Puerto Escondidoan mushrooms were the same as GT&#039;s but these looked to hasve very different characteristic as far as the caps are concerned.<br /><br />10/5 for high quality and grown, washed, and dried with great care. My last shroom experience was 4 grams of golden teachers pulverized into a powder and added to a bowl of oatmeal with sugar and butter added. This time I crumbled them up with my fingers as they were dried perfectly like as dry as crackers. I had 4 options on what to add them to this time. Oatmeal, which I wanted something different this time, Chili Beans, which I always wanted to try them in, Pancakes , which were of my own recipe from scratch using flower, baking powder, salt, suger, crushed almonds, milke, and vanilla extract with a bit of ginger added also. I also had some Tnus fish which sounded like a great idea to hide the taste good with so I poured out the tuna fish into a bowl and crumbled the shrooms into it and added a spoonful of mayo and thin mixed it up with a fork making it as evenly mixed as possible. I then added it all to a sandwich, a thick sandwich. I could have made two out of it easily but you know why I didn&#039;t lol.<br /><br />Anyway the sandwich was great and I could taste no shrooms taste what so ever. Highly impressive and I finished the sandwich in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />30 minutes later: Started feeling a slight body load. Felt lazy and yawned a bit. I layed down and started watcing a movie then I fell a sleep.<br /><br />at 90 minutes: woke up not knowing where I was and I was disoriented. I was watching The Odessey with Armand Assante. One of my favs. I set up and smoked a cigerette. Everywhere I looked was kind of blurry and had three or more outlines to it. like the tv had 3 different outlines with one screen and so on with everything, The more I woke up from the nap the more i was tripping balls hard.<br /><br />T-2 hours: I finally pulled myself up from the bed as the body buzz had me at a couch lock type of high. I really enjoy the way shrooms make my body feel. To me it feels like I have taken about ten somas without the &quot;knocking me out&quot; feature. I perfer it to taking somas or pain pills for the relief of body aches. It is one of my favorite things about eating shrooms and these were no different and in fact these were a bit stronger in that regard. I can be seated or standing or laying down and my body feels so relaxed and comfortable while on these Puerto Escondidoan mushrooms.<br /><br />T-4 hours. Having some awesome trips and the closed eyed visuals were incredible. At times I often discovered that my eyes were closed and was surprised at this. Tell me please is their a tolerance with mushrooms? I always thought there was but I wanted to ask because I can&#039;t wait to order some more and do these again. I may eat 6 grams and see what happens. I have realy come to like the shroom experience. The trip is natural and I like that over LSD being chemical like. I was feeling waves of euphoria like it was hitting me in cycles. It would lighten up and then all the sudden I was looking around in a daze again. The outside world is just incredible while tripping on these.<br /><br />T-6 hours: I know I was going thru the come down at this time but still feeling waves of euphoria and they were getting weaker after each wave. The comedown was very gentle nad I had no kind of hangover effects the next day. Thru hours 7 and 8 I had some afterglow effects were I felt great and wanted to share my experience with the world but I had to settle for my brother lol. He&#039;s afraid to try shrooms. I told him he could have had half of my sandwich but he refused and was talking about a drug test . So I did not think these were tested for or showed up in any of the quick ten or quick 5 panel test but I will check erowid.com for that info.<br /><br />Out of all the drugs I have tried thru the years it would seem that magic mushrooms and marijuana are the two favorites for me. I still love LSD and mdma but those are man made. I will still do them from time to time but I&#039;d like to do more experimenting with shrooms for nowand maybe do some mixing. I hear that eating shrooms and mdma at the same time is great. What are you guys&#039; opinioin on mixing the two? I am expecting some MDMA and I&#039;d like to order again fro MainStay.<br /><br />Great Job MainStay as soon as we have a winner I will feature your namesin my TopVendor&#039;sList. I already added your name MainStay. The link Is in my sig below.<br />

I am having a hard time staying out of them but I want to gauge the potency of the 6 first. It has not been ten minutes since I ate those. I have had nothing to eat except for those gummies today.

You&#039;d best have coins now if you want this weed.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely up there with the top 5 best I have ever had. Thanks Joe for the awesome sample. I rolled a fatty and me and my brother got stoned from it three different times plus I had some for my bowl. The smell is heavenly being an OG. The first toke gave me a head buzz and it&#039;s great for body aches and insomnia. Relaxing to the max.<br />5/5 for quality which is really a 10/5<br /><br />5/5 for stealth and quickness. It&#039;s great to see these vendors going to the new way of sealing that can&#039;t be detected by x-rays. I am hoping I can get some before he runs out.

It came very quickly just as James Hardens Beard says. It blended in great with my other incoming mail.<br /><br />IT was .55 on weight for the rocky drone. Check out my pic:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8zd.jpg<br /><br />The blue was .60 on weight and here&#039;s the pic:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8zt.jpg<br /><br />I also got the two pills and will do the review on them as well. They were all in separates and the 2 pills were in tact<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve tried some of the rocky crystals and used a card to crush them down into a powder then cut out a couple of lines from that.I did&nbsp; around 100mg insufflated and so did my brother. We both have dilated pupils right now and we did the lines 30 minutes ago. This is definitely some higher quality drone that I have ever done. The taste and drain is a slight chemical taste but very easy to tolerate and the rush starts coming on with in 5 minutes and builds up and gets stronger from there. So far this has been an excellent transaction from wertu and i appreciate it so much! I feel great! <br /><br />I been researching on erowid and so I am fighting any urges to redose and from what I&#039;ve red it&#039;s first dose is the best dose and so it may be better to stretch it out so to get the best effects from it each time. When I come down from this high I will try the blue and report back to you all. <br /><br />Thanks wertu I will pm you when I have you featured in my TopVendorsThread title with my review on the last page. I may run a contest for you to try to help you get more buyers.. I will post this review in the rumor mill meph threads now<br /><br />edit: Just posted my review in the rumor mill here:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105759.0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have tried the pills and they are great.

Maybe we should try him out?<br /><br />TOP NOTCH NO DOUBT!<br /><br />Thanks Haizenberg for the free 150 mg sample. This&nbsp; definitely is some of the best MDMA I have ever had if not the very best. . Having a hard time seeing the words on the screen right now. 10/5 for quality. However my tolerance is at baseline as it&#039;s been a while since I had any MDMA crystals. I had one of PPLLUURRSS red mario from JOR 2 or 3 weeks ago. <br /><br />This MDMA had different shades of grey in it and was mostly hard chunky crystals. When I put it on my scales the numbers were jumping back and forth from 140- 150mg. My scale goes down to a .01<br /><br />Thank you Haizenberg for the heavy dose! +1&nbsp; I put it sll on my tongue and chased it down with a soda 2 hours ago. This feels so much cleaner then any I&#039;ve had including gelman&#039;s.&nbsp; Sorry for any mistakes or mis spellings I&#039;ll fix them when I see them. Just 15 minutes after dosing it up I noticed a difference in body temperature&nbsp; and fuzzy vision which is on par with other mdma I have had. I think I am still on my way up but I may be going thru the peak hours. <br /><br />5/5 on the shipping I think a lot of thought went into and thanks for that stealth method I am going to keep it because it means a lot coming from you.&nbsp; Only Haizenberg knows what day he sent it but I am thingking it took close to 3 weeks which is 15 daus because of the holidays and sundays. Thank you so much Haizenberg it really hit the spot. Finally a good strong roll so my MDMAQ dry streak ids officially over!<br /><br />This stuff is really strong. No jaw clenching yet but my pupils are as big as flying saucers. The euphoria is just incredibly sensational. I started feeling the empathic effects after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I am going to try to help get you some more buyers and I will be posting this review in several threads. Wow it&#039;s really hard to concentrate right now. Thanks again Haizenberg and I&#039;ll come back here and edit this when the effects start to diminish.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Got my half gram from TeflonDon and it weighed .57 so thanks for the extra! <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fcd75a08d2<br /><br />Shipping was quick and stealthy. Better than vac seal. It blendid in with my regular mail beautifully and had great return label.<br />I insufflated 50 mmg and it did not burn at all and had that classic coke taste and smell. It numbed my nasal cavity about 5 minutes after and there was not much drip. I touched some to my tongue and numbed it up. <br /><br />The euphoria lasted me about 2 hours from 50 mg. There&#039;s not much cut if any in this coke. I dont have any testing equipment at this time so I cooked a little at a 4 to 1 ratio with baking soda. It looked like it every bit came back as free base nice and clear off white. It tasted great hitting it with a glass stem. This coke has to be in the 90&#039;s percent.

He answers messages back swiftly with knowledgable helpful answers. <br /><br />Angelina<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/93e8dfc3c3<br />If you like marijuana suckers and candies try out angelina. I got one from her for free and it was amazing. Product was vac sealed but it looks like a sucker anyway if they had opened it. It was a big round sucker full of THC. I got half way thru it and had to lay it down but that was cool because I picked it back up in maybe ten minutes and finished it off. Edibles are great but they give you a different kind of high. After you get used to getting your THC that way then the littlest edible will floor you. I prefer these suckers over the cookies they are much more potent in my opinion. Maybe it has something to do with the slow ingestion process.<br /><br />caerus<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4c44d3c164<br />Awesome high quality weed vendor who let me review for him and it was excellent with quick vac sealed shipping. He currently has loads of happy customers<br /><br />tweetb<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/323599a037<br />I bought some I think Trainwreck from this vendor but he had&#039;nt placed it in transit so when the cancel button showed up for me I clicked it because I figured he wa too busy to send it and I immediately spent it on something else so I owe this vendor still yet because he had already sent it and hadn&#039;t placed it in transit yet. The stealth was among the best I have ever seen with vac seal hidden in layers of stealth. The trainwreck was fucking killer<br /><br />koltbiz<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/c98ac24bf4<br />I was one of the lucky ones to be selected to review a 250 mg sample of coke from columbia off this vendor. All I can say is that it is some of the best coke I ever did. It may even be the best. I can honestly say that I had never seen any coke like it b4 or since. Koltbiz is great to deal with and has a great refund policy and their stealth is unheard but I can&#039;t go no further with the details<br /><br /><br />Tyl3r Durden<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b8da404fa1<br />The leading authority for 25i and 25c nbome. He always sends freebies with every order and just amazingly knowledgeable to talk to. One of my favorite vendors for sure. Last time I ordered 50 hits he sent 100 and the shipping was stealthy as hell. I&#039;ve gotten from him many times and his packages always have come.<br /><br />Ood Sigma<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2f5f7fe482<br />Vac seals and quick shipping. Very nice person and reliable and vends 5-methyl-MDA<br /><br />JiuJitsu<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3c017b4d19<br />Dependable vendor who has high quality golden teacher mushrooms for a great price. Last time I had his shrooms I added 4 grams to a bowl of oatmeal and tripped 7 hours plus had after glow effects and had no bad come down effects. Buy with confidence from this vendor everything is vac sealed and stealthy and quick<br /><br />FredsFarms<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/73fc815e1c<br />Another favorite vendor of mine who I have used a few times. He has some of the best priced regular weed with vac sealed quick shipping and he answers every message to him very quickly. He is dependable and never fucked me over<br /><br />MeanHerb<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a7c4ea2bec<br />A great vendor and awesome person to talk with. He has great prices on herbal potpourri and 30 mg adderral. I have bought from him many times and he has never let me down and will stay in communication with you the whole time you wait for your order<br /><br />Cyclone<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5b14cb70dc<br />I&#039;ve not bought from him yet but he did send me a free 1and a half gram sample of his professional grown shrooms. The strain was penis envy mutant and they were fucking great. He is great with communications&nbsp; and vac seals his stuff with quick shipping. I have almost ordered from him a few times and <br /><br />jesusofrave<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/53555a9222<br />I have gotten a sample from this vendor and almost ordered from them a few times as well. I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to do so and I give this vendor a top score because everyone they sale to ends up happy. They have a plethra of goods including dmt, lsd, a few different kinds of hash, mdma from different sources, x pills, different strains of weed from different parts of the world, and more so check them out<br /><br />cousin frank<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/dce7fa9107<br />I can only say good things about cousin frank because he sent me a sample of mdma and when it got here it was a whole gram of some fucking killer mdma and I owe him my business so get ready cus I haven&#039;t forgotten about that. He has quick shipping as well and also sells good lsd so check out his page<br /><br />&nbsp;BruceCampbell<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b5af5c6f2c<br />a real viking of silk road and a professional vendor in my opinion who holds lotteries and gives out free sample sometimes. I have ordered from him twice and it has been one or 2 day delivery with awesome cunning stealthy measures. The man cares about his customers and has some of the best benzos and mdxx mixed capsules on SR. I&#039;ll be ordering from him again and almost did the other day but he had run out of everything.<br /><br /><br />IgotYAfix<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/95ec8dd0d1<br />A great vendor who uses vac seal and stealthy quick shipping to make sure his customers get their stuff. he sells the best marijuana cookies from time to time and and has mdma and cocaine. Don&#039;t hesitate to use this vendor he wont fuck you over<br /><br />Emonkey<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4ef5547148<br />My favorite vendor from his part of the world with the best X pills I ever had.

Please visit his page for good x pills and mdma<br /><br />maligan<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8923d4cad4<br />Just first used this vendor a few weeks back and had a great experience. Great priced benzos with free priority shipping. The peach xanaxes I got were fresh as hell and maligan is a great vendor to deal with. He is really making a run for the leading benzo vendor here at SR. He also has great priced klonopin. His package arrived in the time frame he gave on his vendor page.<br /><br />ChemistDomestic<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/21192ae7b9<br />An awesom addition to silk road with high quality mdma at a great price for domestic quick stealthy shipped mdma so go check him out he is a great vendor to deal with and never fucked me over<br /><br />strawman<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b020d1187c<br />Another fast vendor for mdma and it&#039;s of high quality.

You can stay in escrow with him as well as all these vendors I have listed but you may want to check out their policies toward new buyers with 0 stats but some of them will welcome you.<br /><br />XXXotica<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1610b34961<br />As of now my favorite vendor for hig quality medical grade marijuana is XXXotica. He has the best sativas in the world and the shipping is always here in 2 or 3 days tops with 3 or 4 vac seals and stealth. I been trying out every strain he has and so I can say trust me and go for the Dutch Treat it&#039;s flat out amazing and better than pineapple express or alien og. <br /><br /><br />shroomeister<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8104f71fa8<br />You will not be sorry to order from this vendor.

I know I&#039;ll order from him again<br /><br />m0rpheu5<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ea256f2cb6<br />This vendor handles himself in a professional manner and cares about getting his customers their stuff. He has a smorgasbord of products for sale ranging from 2CB to 25i. There are 2 pages of stuff he sells so check him out and don&#039;t hesitate to order from him.

				I&#039;ve ordered 5 grams of PRE-BAN mephedrone from wertu.<br /><br />I&#039;ve still got 2 grams left of the ULTRA CRYSTALS I bought from limetless a few months ago.<br /><br />I&#039;ll compare the effects between the two when I receive the goods from wertu and post the results here.<br /><br />By the way, there&#039;s some guy in the forum warning people about possible scams with vendors selling 3-MMC instead of 4-MMC. If anyone is interested in sending a sample to a laboratory please remember to print this PDF article and give it to the lab personnel:<br /><br />http://goo.gl/OsfdH<br /><br />It explains how to differentiate between 2-MMC, 3-MMC and 4-MMC using Infrared Spectrum techniques. It&#039;s not possible to tell them apart using only GC-MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry). You need either NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) or IR (InfraRed) spectrum.

				yo Yo. I got back from work knowing I&#039;ll paid in a couple days and was going to deposit around $200-$300 in SR this time around. Was gonna buy lots of different A+++ medical strains like Blue Dreams, Purple Urkle, Grand Daddy Purple, AK-47, and some Blueberry Kush. And also some adderall and xanax :-)<br /><br />BUT i get a pm from PRivate Reserve with a link to a 0.01 gram A++ OG Kush free sample!!! I have 0.02 left over from ym last deposit and had to chose one stamp I&#039;ll gladly send me last 0.01 to him so make sure i get the Kush. I really want it.<br /><br />AND as luck would have, the only US LSd vendor finally wrote me back. He&#039;ll be putting up the infamous Mayas, his own stamps, and get this: Rainbow Family Liquid Vials!!!!!<br /><br />OMG...i just wanna cash my check asap. SR has a LOT of bunk LSd but this is NOT. A free sample of medicinal weed and the best LSD news ever??? I love it!!!<br /><br />Oh and I am also waiting/looking for Purple AK-47 or high CBD Harlequin...anyone knows anything, LET ME KNOW.<br /><br />So Private Reserve, I placed my order but let me asap about the postage situation....

There was very little smell if any at all but I did not smell it although my nose was a little stopped up. <br /><br />So after I weighed it out I dumped it into a plate and crushed it up and devided it into 2 massive lines and me and my bro snorted back hard. I did not feel shit for a few minutes but Like i said my nose was stopped up so after a few minutes I started snorting back really hard and then I finally started tasting the drain down my throat and eureka!

Maybe we should try him out?<br /><br />TOP NOTCH NO DOUBT!<br /><br />Thanks Haizenberg for the free 150 mg sample. This&nbsp; definitely is some of the best MDMA I have ever had if not the very best. . Having a hard time seeing the words on the screen right now. 10/5 for quality. However my tolerance is at baseline as it&#039;s been a while since I had any MDMA crystals. I had one of PPLLUURRSS red mario from JOR 2 or 3 weeks ago. <br /><br />This MDMA had different shades of grey in it and was mostly hard chunky crystals. When I put it on my scales the numbers were jumping back and forth from 140- 150mg. My scale goes down to a .01<br /><br />Thank you Haizenberg for the heavy dose! +1&nbsp; I put it sll on my tongue and chased it down with a soda 2 hours ago. This feels so much cleaner then any I&#039;ve had including gelman&#039;s.&nbsp; Sorry for any mistakes or mis spellings I&#039;ll fix them when I see them. Just 15 minutes after dosing it up I noticed a difference in body temperature&nbsp; and fuzzy vision which is on par with other mdma I have had. I think I am still on my way up but I may be going thru the peak hours. <br /><br />5/5 on the shipping I think a lot of thought went into and thanks for that stealth method I am going to keep it because it means a lot coming from you.&nbsp; Only Haizenberg knows what day he sent it but I am thinking it took close to 3 weeks which is 15 daus because of the holidays and sundays. Thank you so much Haizenberg it really hit the spot. Finally a good strong roll so my MDMA dry streak ids officially over!<br /><br />This stuff is really strong. No jaw clenching yet but my pupils are as big as flying saucers. The euphoria is just incredibly sensational. I started feeling the empathic effects after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I am going to try to help get you some more buyers and I will be posting this review in several threads. Wow it&#039;s really hard to concentrate right now. Thanks again Haizenberg and I&#039;ll come back here and edit this when the effects start to diminish.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Definitely some killer fluffy bud. It did weight .50 on my scales but it looked a lot bigger and I got 2 joints out of it rolled with small papers. By the third and fourth hit I was coughing as it got harder to hold in. I was feeling the medicinal values as well it was so relaxing. I&#039;m hitting one of the roaches right now in small bowl made perfect to stick a joint in and smoke and I still taste the flavors you get with a J. The legs on it are fabulous.

It smells very much like good mdma. The first pic is better with less blurry. The second pic does not do this stuff justice. It turned out a bit blurry. As you can see in the first pic my sample weighed .240 mg. Thanks Clearance for the large sample. Most vendors don&#039;t usually send that much in a sample. I weighed it out and took pics and then swallowed it down chasing it with a cold fountain drink. That&#039;s been exactly 20 minutes ago and I already feel the come up from it beginning. I&#039;ll let you know how long it last but I&#039;m looking forward to 5 to 7 hours as my tolerance is at baseline.<br /><br />The stealth was awesome. It blinded in well with my other mail and came really quick. It was vac sealed and hidden great. It was also x-ray proof so order with confidence from Clearance. I ate mine after work on an empty stomach and I am feeling it get stronger as I type. So far this is in league with the way good mdma screws with my vision. I can feel my eyes starting to dilate. I&#039;ll be back with more after I start rolling for a bit. Thank you Clearance for letting me review your mdma. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				+ karma to all you who have posted obove me. Thanks for checking out my thread.<br /><br />I got my sample from JumboMonkeyBiscuit:<br />He has samples left the last time I checked<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/75803901ae<br /><br />I got to say that his OG was among the top three best marijuana I have ever had. It&#039;s right up there with the Purple AK-47 and it may be better. This nug weighed .59 and was tightly dense. The smell from it was heavenly like a pine tee mixed with fresh baked cookies. I rolled up a j and the dry hit gave me a buzz. I felt it taking over on the very first hit. I was smoking with my Bro and we were both doing our best to finish it with out putting it out or laying it down. Each hit was a head buzz from hell. Everytime I had exhaled and trying to gain my senses the joint was already back at me ready for the next hit and vise versa with my bro.<br /><br />The stealth was incredible and was in no danger of being intercepted. <br /><br />The Mexi skunk weighed .57 and it was amazing. The smell was fruity and lemony. The buzz from a j shared between 2 of us lasted more then 3 hours. It&#039;s a hard choice but I am partial to the OG and liked it better but I can honestly say that there is not much weed going to be better than JumboMonkeyBiscuit&#039;s OG.

Let&#039;s not forget about the dutch treat which was just as good as JackBlue&#039;s JackTheRipper.<br /><br />Just for the record I got the Purple Ak-47 from NorthWestDirect. It was so fucking great I&#039;ll never forget it. Much like JumboMonkeyBisquits OG as far as legs and packaging goes but the two had different looks and denseness. The AK was a darker green color

I usually prefer the sativa doms too and that&#039;s usually what JackBlue has, but I just got some of his Fire OG today and it is fucking amazing. Not to mention the sample of GSC he sent with it is probably the best GSC I&#039;ve had.

				Hey guys there&#039;s a new benzo vendor on the road who goes by the name stevepharma and here is his link:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2f7b9e3c63<br /><br />My sampler consisted of 30 1 mg park davis xanax and ten roche valumes all blister packed with no rattle and 2 day delivery! Wow what a generous sample and so he has definitely earned my business.<br /><br />Everybody here is just going crazy over these fresh as fuck xanax and V&#039;s. They had an expiration date of 2016!

It ranks right up there with the best the OG strains can offer. I am talking about your strain called Prophet. It was absolutely fantastic. Phenomenal. Immaculate. It was such a gorgeous bud and I just clicked on your listing to get some education about it and I am blown away! I have always been partial to the sativas unless it was a strong pronounced bold OG strain. After smoking your profit, I&#039;d really really rather have it then any other marijuana around that I have tasted including the og strains. <br /><br />You have restored my faith in the sativas being the best between sativas and indicas. This was from your listing:Genetics: Pre-’98 Bubba Kush x Tang Tang males<br /><br />The speed in which I got it is over the top sensational and you have got more business coming from me for sure late this week count on it but don&#039;t count on a huge amount just yet. <br /><br />It seems I am saying that this is the best from every vendor I try but dammit there are so many great vendors who are sending incredibly high THC content marijuana that it&#039;s hard to say who&#039;s is best. With Gaia Garden and the Prophet I smoked as well as the alaskan I feel pretty dam confident that the Prophet is the best marijuana I have eve smoked. My God I want some more. We will see because I have a few more samples coming this week fom some other vendors who look very promising

My tolerance for roxy 30&#039;s is kind of high. To be honest I had no idea that this would be so strong. 10 mg felt like a 30 to me. The people I have turned on are wanting to give me money for more. Seriously after about 2 hours I redosed with another ten mg and I was nodding the rest of the night lol. I guess that&#039;s why I wasn&#039;t on here last night so sorry about the late report. It takes a lot to keep me off here. This dope is a different animal then just plain old roxies<br /><br />Order with confidence folks the stealth is terrific and I am digging for more bit coin now so I can get more.<br /><br />I had picture but now I can&#039;t find them. I think I remember deleting them like a crazy nodding off person lol. Now the cam is gone til later but my pics did not do this great dope any justice anyway. Rest assured tho my order looked exactly as what SirThomasMore has posted on his vendor page. It&#039;s Fire!<br />Thanks again for the over size order man I really appreciate it SirThomasMore.

I recently received a free coke sample from Italianmafiabrussels and was very impressed with:<br /><br />a) The guy`s communication<br />b) Speed of which sample arrived. Actually was in my mailbox 2 days earlier than he promised it would arrive. Never happened in all my years of ordering that gear arrives faster than promised.<br />c) The fact he sent me a free sample at all was impressive. Again, I`ve never been offered/given free drugs by an internet stranger before.<br />d) The product was actually THE BOMB! So impressed that I`ve ordered 2g from him which is as much as I can afford to spend on my habit this second.<br />e) Price is ridiculously low compared to others on SR and sample was generous so I`m hoping the g`s are too. (I`ll update when they arrive and have been tested)<br />f) Stealth was awesome. Totally indistinguishable from other mail and product was neatly sealed and dry.<br /><br />I`m no scientist and just rate my gear by how it makes me feel and it`s up there with the best I`ve ever had in my drug career.<br /><br />Can`t recommend this vendor enough!<br /><br />Peace out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ll be telling about my coke from him soon.

Very friendly, knowledgeable of his products. Answered all questions quickly and professionally! <br /><br />Shipping/Stealth*5/5<br /><br />Very good shipping speed, coming from east coast as promised! Received in 3 days! Stealth was great, maybe add a color barrier and printed labels, my two only suggestions. Otherwise stealth was great! Vaccination sealed multi times, no smell.<br /><br />Products*5/5<br /><br />I sampled the skywalker og and the wiz K aka True OG<br /><br />Wow both of these strains look amazing and smell great!<br />The wiz K is so beautiful! Smells awesome and really smokes well. Well taken care of buds! Me and the gf vaped some of this around 11pm at the end of our day and it put us exactly were we needed to be! Great stone!<br />The skywalker og! My favorite out of the two. Oh man this herb looks and smells outstanding lol! Really this bud is too me almost as good as it gets! Great high with this one, I can really feel it come on quick with this one! Kept me nice and stoned for a couple hours!<br /><br />Thank you ECF for the great samples!

				So many great vendors - now if the assholes messing with the SR would only become human and seek harmony all vendors could do the same and we travelers of the SR could be at the forefront of a movement promoting world peace, love, and harmony!

It&#039;s much like SR. Register a new account then scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on &quot;Forums&quot;. Register a new forum account. When you get that done look in the header and click on the word &quot;member&quot;. Look at the members they have so far. Do you see any familiar names?<br /><br />With SR being down I for one need another option to commence my buying habits until SR is back up.

We completely forgot out about it while blabbering shit at each for about an hour when all of a everyone said &quot;wow&quot; as the smooth, warm tingles started coming in waves from our stomach. For the next 3 hours it was bliss with everybody commenting on how amazing the MDMA was and begging me to get more ASAP.<br /><br />Dropped another 120mgs and headed out to socialize. Once out the music sounded awesome and the beer went down like water. Smooth taking ladies with ease, got 2 hotties numbers so this Molly definitely put me in the zone&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Comedown was smooth. Was more hungover than anything. The next day everyone was lining up to put in an order in for this MDMA. All in all I would say its in the top 3 on SR and Bungee54 deserve a spot in the MDMA Avengers thread.

Under my avatar there will be 3 choices: 1-add me to your buddy list, 2-send PM, and 3- show posts<br /><br />If you PM me then it may be up to 24 hours before I answer it because I have a J.O.B. Yip I actually have to spend most of my waking hours at a place of employment where I promote myself thru hard work and positive attitude. Those who work with me or near me always wind up in a good mood before the end of their shift. To be able to work and to have the opportunity to work is priceless to me. I&#039;m there because I need the cash no doubt but I don&#039;t work according to how much I make.<br /><br />The art of self promotion allows more opportunities to open up for you so you can make more money. Self promotion thru hard work will keep you from being laid off or fired when the slow times come upon your place of employment. <br /><br />It allows you to become UN-expendable. People usually fall into two categories at the work place. Those who won&#039;t do what is ask of them and those who will ONLY do what is ask of them. In both cases these people are limited. I invite you to promote your self and go the extra mile at your place of employment. Make yourself stand apart from your co-workers and be aware at the respect it gets you. Be thankful for each task that you get to do and when you&#039;ve run out of work then stand apart from the rest of the sheep and create something to keep you busy even if it&#039;s just to grab a broom or a rag to clean.<br /><br />In conclusion I want to say that most people are un aware about the value of good honest labor. Even if you don&#039;t work a job it&#039;s important to do a little work daily. Your body and mind needs it. <br /><br />Have a great day people.

I will talk to Mike about the next big vote being for the best cocaine on SR. I&#039;d like to see him edit his poll once again for the best mdma. He needs to weed out the re-sellers and only list the source vendors right?&nbsp; So all the vendors in the EU and the Netherlands are probably getting their MDMA from one or 2 sources ya know? The American vendors are probably getting theirs from the same place right? <br /><br />I&#039;d go out on a limb and say that the Canadian and some American vendors are getting theirs from Fred. Let me know who is a source for who and we will weed out the re-sellers

				+1 HeeHaw your a valuable member of my team and thanks for the shout out I have added Mercury31 and Fartbomber. <br /><br />As for the cocaine vote I have already been thinking of having a vote for the best coke on SR next after this vote. I&#039;m going to run this vote for another month. It will be concluded on 6-10-13 and the winner at that time will get an order from me for an amount that&#039;s undecided on right now. If the winning vendor does not ship to my country then The SR patron of his choice will get a free gram from Me. If the winning vendor does ship to me then the amount ordered will be more maybe possibly 5 grams. <br /><br />The same will be done in the cocaine vote. I&#039;d really like to try out those vendors who don&#039;t ship over here so maybe if they have a reseller I can get with them like I know Murcury31 has a reseller here or he did last time I checked with IgotYafix? I&#039;ve not heard from him in a while tho

				Man did I get blasted last night. Thanks to ForeverJung and his generous sample. Check out my pic:<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/q5rP.jpg<br /><br />The weed was very good even tho it had &quot;low quality&quot; written on the outer packaging. 2.44 grams of it!

I&#039;m still partying with their gear right now! That GHB is smooth and clean and some high quality product. Sure it taste like hell but That&#039;s how good GHB taste as far as I&#039;ve read about it. This was my first time with it and it worked much like the other experiences I have read about here and on Erowid.&nbsp; I started with a 2 ml dose and in ten or 15 minutes I started feeling like I had took 4 somas. Dam it was relaxing.&nbsp; A couple hours later I took another 2 ml and smoked a Joint of that good weed. I was pretty out of it.<br /><br />The 2CI was killer. I dosed up on it about 2 hours after that J. It was clean tasting like clear vodka should I would say 80 proof. So the GHB knocked me out before the @ci kicked in. I woke up 2 hours later and the place was going fucking apeshit! I went out side and smoked like half a joint and I was just blistered. Everything in my field of vision was alive and moving. My dose on it was a full 5 ml dose. <br /><br />The stealth and packaging were most excellent ForeverJung.

Awesome speed of delivery.<br /><br />I got 2 fat joints out of the generous free sample sent by Private Reserve. It consisted of one thick chunk of sour diesel condensed so tight and it was sticky whenever I started tearing it apart. The smell from me tearing it up fill the room I was in. It looked like it has patches of purple or some variant of dark red colors. <br /><br />The papers I use are 1.25&#039;s. Half way thru a joint the resin build up was really heavy. The aroma was just &quot;Sweet Flowers&quot;&nbsp; and the medicinal values were evident from the dry hit.

				I&#039;ve only gotten mdma on SR through Cloudsurfer, so my opinion is obviously biased, but the reviews speak for themselves. Phenomenal stealth, super clean molly, and excellent customer service. It&#039;s really a pleasure to do business with him/her/they. As long as Cloudsurfer is on the road, there&#039;s no reason to look anywhere else for mdma IMO. <br />Also, 100% of people I&#039;ve let sample the product have come back with rave reviews, and most of them are by no means inexperienced users.

Very secure packaging for domestic service!<br /><br />Communication: Communication was great and this seller was very responsive to my messages and questions. Seems like a cool guy&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Product: Most importantly, the quality of the Methylone was fantastic. The M1 came as huge crystal rocks and looked very appetizing. I split it up and bombed it with a friend and we had a blast! The experience was reminiscent of a moderate roll on MDMA. There was tons of empathy and bonding, and a good amount of euphoria. There was also a lot of energy, stimulation and focus. There was hardly any comedown after the high and the next day I felt back to baseline and functional.<br /><br />This has probably been my most enjoyable Methylone experience to date, so that should say something about the quality of Tigerrush&#039;s product.

				Hey guys I am wandering who is in the lead in the vote? Like I said I am not voting because that would be biased right? So I can&#039;t see the results so far.

All I can say is WOW!<br /><br />I can&#039;t thank you enough for sending me a FREE sample of your MDMA, Mephedrone, and Ketamine at 300mg each. The stealth was great blending in with all my regular mail and came quicker than some vendors that are in the border state from me. I could not believe it when it arrived. Holy shit man you really got it out quick.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading about K for a while now on here and at erowid but I was not really expecting that kind of effects from it. I snorted 50 mg for my first time and I thought I was going to K-hole. It was so intense even tho I have never done it before. You really got me with the K man I gotta have some more of that stuff. I guess I&#039;m lucky with the low tolerance and all so I&#039;m gonna try to keep it that way and not over do it too much. I really loved it man it was awesome. Too bad no other vendor let me try it from them because they would have got my business for sure as long as it was as good as yours seems to be. I can&#039;t help feeling that my tolerance has something to do with it like with the first line of coke I did or the first time I ate mdma.<br /><br />I let a couple of my friends try it with me and now I am kicking myself in the ass for it. It was their first time as well and we were all walking on the moon and it was fucking crazy to here ourselves trying to talk. I went to the kitchen and came back to the living room and as I entered it one of them fell flat on his back against the couch and the other one was already crawling and laughing. All three of us hadn&#039;t never had anything do us this way. <br /><br />I felt the 50 mg for about 2 hours and felt it tapering off for the next hour. There were no bad side effects while coming down. After I straightened up I felt really good so I ate 200 mg of your mdma. I&#039;ll leave that review in your mdma thread. It was great tho. And the drone was the best I have had in my life. I feel like that was the first real mephedrone I ever had. That review will be in the drone thread. <br /><br />Thanks man you earned my future business with the K before I even tried the other two. Hope your feeling great and having a great time whatever you are doing. See ya on the flip side<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />K Queen&#039;s vendor page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3cbe650095<br /><br />Forum review threads:<br />ket http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=143732.0<br />mdma http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155276.0<br />drone&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154135.0<br /><br />My first ever experience with Ketamine blowed my mind. I&#039;m sold! Getting more asap.<br /><br />K Queen sent me top quality products. All three of my samples were top notch grade AAA pure and clean products. K Queen was good enough to send me a Free sample of each including postage so one good turn deserves another and I&#039;ll be happy to FE for this &quot;Top Notch Professional&quot; vendor but If your in their country you don&#039;t have to FE so you guys over there are lucky as hell to have a vendor like K Queen. Still tho It&#039;s worth it to me because their stealth made it here in 3 days and the products are better than most and maybe even better than all.<br /><br />After I did the first 50 mg of Ket and sobered up from it I ate 200 mg of the mdma and rolled hard for 5 or 6 hours then snorted 100 mg of the pink drone. What a rush! It kicked the mdma back in hard for another two hours. Really tho at that time I don&#039;t know how long it all lasted because I was up for two days redosing on the mdma and the drone. I had a blast and had to keep visine in and wear sunglasses during the daylight hours flying kites and playing baseball out in the yard and didn&#039;t have any bad after effects or hangovers when I did finally go to sleep. Getting ready to finish the K off after I log off here.<br /><br />edit: I just read K Queen&#039;s vendor page again and according to their policy I wouldn&#039;t have to FE so please read their page and notice their policy on FE.

				I would like to add my thumbs up for KQueens gear and service....<br /><br />I have bought K and MDMA from KQueen and have always found both to be excellent quality.<br /><br />Took a while for the MDMA to be in stock but they where generous with the amount when they got it in and the quaility is A1 had some MDMA from another vendor which was also excellent and it would be hard to say which was better (I have had some less good stuff on SR but never any real shit).&nbsp; The MD was nice big crystals and a 50mg test line spoke volumes about the quality :D this weekend shared with a few mates and we all loved it!!<br /><br />I only buy my ket from KQueen as their service is so good, next day almost every time and realy friendly service too.<br /><br />So get paid soon and it will be back to the palace for supplies&nbsp; :D <br /><br /><br />

				Iv&#039;e been a fan of Ivory&#039;s MDMA always .3-.5g overweight. The first time I sampled his wares a year ago, come up was like a roller coaster. Then at the peak you have the most incredible body-gasm didn&#039;t need to redose for about 3 &amp; a half hours. The MDMA had a get up and go qaulity to it instead of cant move to munted. before Ivory I was used to speed bombs &amp; it wasn&#039;t that type of get up &amp; go qaulity. The next day I felt a beuatiful afterglow well into the evening. The MDMA then was cola brown slighty tacky, yet when crushed it was brittle....interesting....<br />To satisfy my own curiosity iv&#039;e&nbsp; ordered some more to compare to last years. This years looks more like what is in Ivory&#039;s MDMA listing picture, more yellow, honey, champagne colour to it with a few rocks that are the cola colour. a member called mschen did a review on Ivory&#039;s new stuff over in the Avengers MDMA thread &amp; his thought of it was that the new gear has a calm roll qaulity to it. Ill report back on the subjective diffrrences between the 2. <br /><br />Much love.<br /><br />Excalibured.

It was a fluffy fine snow white powder and did not burn at all. The other reviews about it not smelling like traditional classic coke were accurate. However it did taste like great cola to me. The numbing effects were on par with great coke I&#039;ve had in the past from off the road and from off my streets. I do live in an area where HQ coke is available. This was some of the better coke that I&#039;ve had from vendors off the road. The effects from a 50mg line lasted me three hours. The euphoria was incredibly bliss. <br /><br />I would say this coke is better than Delta 11&#039;s, Koltbiz&#039;s first batch, and many others I&#039;ve had. Thanks IMB for letting me review your cola IT&#039;s been great.

I think I got to up close this time. It&#039;s a little fuzzy but you can see that it&#039;s rocky and this is after I smashed it a little then thought about taking a pic<br /><br /><br />Weight was over a half gram got .64 on scales. Stealth was great better then vac seal. Got here quick and rocky coke looks and taste amazing.<br /><br />&nbsp;Some numbing not much. Numbing accured about 2 minutes after touching the scraper to my tongue. The effects were not right away but took a couple of minutes to notice them. At first I thought this is some dam good kick ass coke and it is. The effects from a 50 mg line last between an an hour and 90 minutes. The nasal cavity gets numb and so does the back of the throat. This isn&#039;t speedy at all, no jitters and no evidence of speedy cuts at all. Hey Strickland Cocaine if you say this is average quality then I can&#039;t wait to see what you call high quality. The coke came as a solid rock with some small rocks and a very little amount of powder. It looks like he sent one big rock and the powder manifested during transit. This coke reminds me of stuff I was getting in the 90&#039;s except that stuff was much softer and not as good. This rock cocaine required a lot of pressure to crush it and then a lot of chopping. I love it! I&#039;ll be ordering more. Thanks KOTT for the stealthy high quality fast shipped ROCK hard cocaine. I been looking for this since I found the road and had given up on it. Can&#039;t wait to try your next batch.<br /><br />King of the Trill was true to his word and gave me the DCN right from the time he sent it. I have reviewed a lot of coke on SR and been looking for something like this. I finally got a great hook up with fast delivery for the hardest rock cocaine I ever had from SR. He says that this is not that good of quality? I guess he means the legs maybe because it does seem to just quit all at once after 90 minutes and it has that moreish quality. Well I love coke like this. Back in the 90&#039;s me and a few friends use to get some rock cocaine but it was not as hard as this. We would smear it on aluminum foil with a little backing soda and just enough water to make it a paste. That&#039;s how we would chase the dragon. <br /><br />I shared this coke also and my buddy thought it was better then the last coke we sampled from here. In my opinion it&#039;s better than any coke I have had from the road. Seriously I want to get in touch with strickland cocaine and see if I can somehow marry his sister or somehow become related to the guy. <br /><br />Don&#039;t hesitate to order from King of the Trill you will not regret it if you want great quality rock hard coke. It would have been great to just shave this rock with a razor blade. I should have dropped some in some ammonia but I had company thru out different times of the day.<br /><br />This vendor gets a 10/5 from me on quality, customer communications, stealth and quick delivery, the whole 9 yards! Maybe I am biased because this is the kind of coke i love. No clog noses. No runny noses. The drainage was very bitter and numbed the throat but not bad. But the bitterness did prompt the need for something to drink but I loved it. Great job King of the Trill! <br /><br />also posted in the rumor mill&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.6990<br /><br />and will add it to my top vendors thread soon<br /><br />So MC you went thru this in an hour? And it&#039;s no good for shooting? Yea my sample lasted me and my boy all day and we just split the rest of it an hour ago and I am still tasting it and feeling euphoric. We snorted it all. I too had some of koltbiz&#039;s first batch and would prefer this coke instead.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />King of the Trill vendor page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/501ad082ff<br /><br />Forum reviews:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=103769.0<br /><br />Strickland Cocaine is just a delight to talk with and has very fast shipping with great stealth.&nbsp; The coke is of top quality.

Here is my review<br /><br />Communication:<br /><br />He was very good about keeping me updated through the whole process. He let me know a few days ahead of time when he was going to ship it, and true to his word, he shipped in when he promised. I know it&#039;s a fairly minor thing, but I&#039;d also like to mention that his writing style is very professional. Proper spelling, whole sentences, etc... I feel like that shows care and professionalism. I don&#039;t like having to read a message from a vendor three times just to figure out what the hell they&#039;re trying to say.<br />Communication score: 5/5<br /><br />Shipping:<br /><br />Utopic shipped my order exactly when he said he would, by the method promised. Shipping time to the western US was just two days (maybe three? I can&#039;t quite remember) either way, it was fast and arrived a little before I expected it would.<br />Shipping score: 5/5<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />I was a little worried about ordering a marijuana product through the mail due to the strong and easily recognized smell, but he triple vacuum sealed the hash, which was inside of a couple other things. There was no scent at all, even after sitting in my hot car while I ran a few errands. The external package was very professional and businesslike. My sample order was for .5 grams, but it actually weighed out to a little over 700mg, so that was a nice bonus as well.<br />Packaging score: 6/5<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t had a chance to actually have a puff of the sample, but it looks and smells fantastic. Once I try it, I&#039;ll make another post about product quality.<br /><br />Based on my experience so far, I highly recommend Utopic, and would happily place more orders with him in the future. Especially for a new vendor, his packaging was A+ on the first try. In my experience the first few orders a new vendor ships out could stand some improvement on the packaging, but I really couldn&#039;t think of even anything minor to complain about.<br /><br />Welcome to SR, Utopic, and keep up the good work!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Utopic has agreed to let me try out some of his killer weed so Look for my review soon.

I&#039;m talking about a gram of m1 with the re dosing. I&#039;m wanting to drop some cid but don&#039;t want to waste it. If no body knows then I&#039;ll just wait.

				I&#039;m very interested in seeing what direction Silk Road is going in. Sometimes I think the whole site was built up just to build the bit coin economy. What happens tom the current marketplace if bit coin takes over as a mainstream choice of currency? Bitinstant is working on a debit card that stores bit coin and you can use it to buy and sell goods and services. <br /><br />Has anyone seen those tangible bitcoins that break in half so you can add the amount to a wallet?

I know I rolled harder than ever on 200 mg and the night before I had done a gram of methylone which did not deplete all my serotonin but it had to deplete some. <br /><br />I had a hit from somebody here say ing it was 350 ug but it could not have been. I had soem from tesselated it was ratedd at 200ug but yours was much stronger. Until I had the avatar you gave me the strongest L i had from here was a yin yang dolphin blotter from albionessentials and it was said to have been 125ug.<br /><br />I think the ug rating doesn&#039;t matter so much if it&#039;s not a&nbsp; certain kind of lsd for me. Maybe i like the needlepoint over the white fluff or what ever. have you tried any of the al-lad stuff?

				shit man you are kidding me! Dammit well do you know anonymous addict?<br /><br />Man mine showed up quick and I want to get more to slang to my friends because i know that they would want to do this lsd. It&#039;s not very common around here an that&#039;s why I think I could easily get 15 per hit and maybe 20 a hit after they do it the first time and see how clean and good it really is.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about getting a ten strip this payday and handing out at least 2 as samplers to work colleagues so the other people I work with will believe they are great and start buying them. Man I&#039;d love it if she could front me like a half sheet or something to get started in this. There&#039;s a lot of people around here who are willing to pay for good clean acid that has some strength to it rather than getting fucked by somebody selling nbomes<br /><br />I hope you get yours soon man your gonna love it

				that&#039;s not true jampants, as we worked out yesterday, we&#039;re one of the cheapest lsd vendors per ug on the site : check the last&nbsp; 2-3 pages of the avengers thread where we are discussing this : <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.10035<br /><br />and our xtc and mdma is priced to be slightly more reasonable than other non-holland based vendors.<br />we never wanted to be in competition with the the bulk vendors or dutch sellers.<br />we are a spanish based vendor with dutch quality products, our prices are very competitive for this part of the market!<br />and we are getting plenty of business and interest in our products, so we&#039;re not worried :)

				Cher is an AMAZING vendor. He took the whole &quot;free sample&quot; thing to a whole other level. I&#039;ve never been offered LSD for aa free sample but this guy not only offered me a free hit of STRONG LSD but 2 hits of STRONG LSD. Different blotters at that. On top of TWO different INCREDIBLY strong blotters, he also sent me a half gram of The cleanest looking rocksalt-looking molly. I&#039;ve yet to sample the mdma but the Yellow bordered gandalf took me on one hell of a ride at a phish concert. I couldn&#039;t stand and dance with everyone else for the first 2 hours of the trip. I just rode the music and it was incredible. The gandalf was supposed to be the weaker of the two but it was PLENTY strong enough for the concert. Maybe too strong for a concert.&nbsp; I just wanted to chime in and say the Yellow border Gandalfs are INCREDIBLE and I&#039;m almost certain the mdma is the best there is.

				what&nbsp; beautiful day! The birds are chirping and the bees are buzzing. Let me tell ya a little story bout the birds and the bees. I had mary jane rotten crotch begging on her hands and knees. She said &quot;Oh pull it out please please please!&quot; I threw her down on my bed filled her mouth with my dick head. Pinned her ankles up next to her ears, made her drink a few beers and she thought we were wed.<br /><br />Just laying around while she rode my lap. Her tits in my face this had to be a trap. Too good to be true was the name of my thoughts. Her eyes dilated after she ate my mdma salts. &quot;Ride the lightening&quot; I screamed at her when out of her ass fell a nasty turd.<br /><br />I said &quot;get the fuck off you nasty dirty bitch&quot; as the turd hit my leg and made me itch. I took a shower and began to pout as I screamed at her to get the fuck out. I changed my mind as I hadn&#039;t came yet I told her to wait because her twat was still wet.<br /><br />We both showered and cleaned all the bed clothes and I took her to my game room where I have a lot of stripper poles. I put on some music and we danced to the beat we dropped 2 hits of acid from my brand new sheet. My purple headed yogurt slanger began to pulsate hard as my shaft continued to reciprocate after we done that 2 gram shard.<br /><br />good morning peeps
