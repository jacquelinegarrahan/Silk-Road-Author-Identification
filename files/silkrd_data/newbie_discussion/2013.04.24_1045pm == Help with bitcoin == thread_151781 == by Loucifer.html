				Hi,<br /><br />What is the best place to buy bitcoin? Once I buy it how do I get it into my SR account? I am looking around the internet and getting more and more confused on how to proceed. <br /><br />Thanks

				Yo Loucifer, I get my BTC from SR vendors. If you look under the money category there&#039;s vendors who will exchange you for something similar to a prepaid credit card, and deposit money in your account for a small fee. If you&#039;re American, Moneypaks are the way to go. Since they don&#039;t sell those in my country, I use a Ukash card and exchange the code for bitcoins. Try to pick vendors with reliable feedback, and keep in mind the vendors paid a good deal of cash to set up their account, and strive for good feedback so it is reliable.

				im just answering to come closer to my 50 posts ^^<br />the thing is i dont want to spam to 50 so i rather answer a basic question like this even all the info is easily available here and also on the clearweb<br /><br />best site will depend on wich country you live in , then getting it to SR is quite easy, first you transfer the coins to one or several addresses you create and then from there to SR<br />wallets can be generated by bitcoin software or through online wallet services, i would go with the software if i was you or even a combination of both<br /><br />oh and i nearly forgot, you can also generate coins by mining them but good luck with that (i let you google it yourself to find out how and why its hard)

				I got my first batch of BTC from Coinbase and I&#039;m cool with that. The wait is a bit, but if you plan ahead thats never been an issue.
