				Okay so I used to use this site called block chain wallet or something like that to create one of those money gram pages with instructions to use at a money gram in order for it to be sent to your wallet with bitcoin. This site no longer uses the same method. I forgot all the terminology but basically I need a new site that has a wallet with the same kind of system where you essentially type in the amount of bitcoin you want and it creates that money gram page with instructions to pay zip zap or whoever else. I know I&#039;m being super vague, but I remember just what I did and not what everything was called. It was all natural to me until they got rid of this feature. Any help is appreciated.

The big problem I&#039;m beginning to have with this is my vendor is growing in size and I think he&#039;s falling behind a little bit. He&#039;s still amazing and I obviously won&#039;t mention his name on here. My logic could be off here, but I also think they like to sit on the coins for a while to see if the price of bitcoin goes up so they can give you considerably less bitcoin so it just takes a long ass time. Again, I&#039;m not the best with numbers and economics lol so my logic could be off, but that would be my bet. When in reality I don&#039;t understand how it could take more then a few minutes because user to user transfers are very, very quick. I think they just sit on the coins so they can come out with more money which I get, but it is also a pain when you have to wait such a long time. The other problem I have is that many will not deal with less than a few hundred bucks at once. I&#039;m not going to shell out more than a few hundred bucks on drugs lol.

				And I do urge someone to correct me on this if I&#039;m wrong, because I don&#039;t want to be giving out bad information and I also would like to know myself. It&#039;s just that would be the only explanation as to why it could take 12 hours or more to receive coins. Some will argue the vendors have lives and aren&#039;t always on which is true, but not true at all in my case. I am always communicating with my vendor so it&#039;s definitely not the fact that he&#039;s not online. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not sure. Again any input on this matter would be nice.

				I have thought of accepting CC for Bitcoins , only backlash is once they receive the coins they call the CC Company and dispute the charges and the vendor is out of the coins... Jus food for thought, but I have been thinking of doing it.&nbsp; Western Union, Money Gram, Cash by Mail, and Deposit into my Bank Account&nbsp; I like the best since I have the cash in hand and they cant dispute the transaction.

				Local buy or cash in mail is best. The later is the MOST risky. But allows ultimate anonymity.
