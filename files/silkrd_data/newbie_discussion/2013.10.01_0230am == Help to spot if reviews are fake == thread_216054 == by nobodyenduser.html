				I was going to make a purchase from safteyoff13 and he mentioned to check his reviews and so I looked and saw three &quot;5&quot;reviews for the same product I was going to purchase from<br /><br />2thumbsup<br />Willowsmom<br />B3rnz0Matic<br /><br />but when I search for those names nothing comes up. Now could it be that they are using an alias? I search for my own name and it comes up and i can also find safetyoff13&#039;s name but not any of the ones who left reviews when I use search

You have to use multiple factors when trying to figure out if the vendor is genuine. The feedback system alone is not sufficient for that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2thumbsup<br />Willowsmom<br />B3rnz0Matic<br /><br />but when I search for those names nothing comes up.

Those are probably the latter and are why you can&#039;t locate them.<br /><br />The old feedback system didn&#039;t list names at all.<br /><br />Trust your gut instinct; if you think a vendor is suspect, then save them for a last resort. Otherwise, look for patterns in their writing or anything that looks/sounds too good to be true.

				If they have 100+ spent from more than a few buyers then they&#039;re probably safe enough to trust. If you&#039;re unsure of a vendor, just order a small sample you wouldn&#039;t mind losing in case things don&#039;t work out, or avoid them altogether.

				some of those reviews were recent and some of those names said they had spent a lot but yet i could not find them.<br /><br />Update: I went to the discussion page and that tells a different story with unhappy people
