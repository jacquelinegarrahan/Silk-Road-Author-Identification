				Paid for express posting. Vendor said he goofed and missed the express posting and sent it the free snail-mail route. Ordered Sunday. Today is of course Saturday. They said it was picked up by usps tuesday or wednesday(unclear from vendor because they sent message at 1:15 am my time) told me what to look for, even told me what state the return address would be from, which is in my same time zone. Hoping it gets here today. It&#039;s possible, but the way this order has gotten all twisted up so far, my luck would be monday being when it gets here. That&#039;s okay if it is Monday. The only problem i have with this is: not knowing 100% that it is even coming, and i haven&#039;t gotten a message back in 2 days from vendor. There is also the matter of the almost 40 bucks that i payed for express shipping. Vendor has excellent stats, and has been on here for more than just a few months, so i&#039;m not gonna start going down that despairing road called &quot;i got fucked&quot;. Just want some closure on this, so all the possibilities behind how this is gonna turn out stop spinning around in my head. Not to mention i am in &quot;need&quot;. Does anybody know what i mean? This is my first orderingproblem i&#039;ve had so far on SR. I understand people make mistakes which is one of the reasons that i am not on here saying the vendors name and pre-maturely calling him/her a scammer.<br /><br /><br />Lastly, because of the &quot;goof&quot; in sending it first class, instead of the express that i&#039;ve paid for, if package gets lost or undelivered i won&#039;t have a leg to stand on in resolution. Administrators will see the transaction number, and that will show that i ordered and paid for express, but still. Anyway, enough with the &quot;my pussy hurts!&quot; Ranting and raving on this forum. Just had to get that out and hopefully(fingers crossed), it will arriive today.
