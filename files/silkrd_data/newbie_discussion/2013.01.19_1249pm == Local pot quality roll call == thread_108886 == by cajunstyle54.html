				I&#039;m in the US, great lakes area, without being too specific. I moved to a new city in the last 6 months, so I haven&#039;t had forever to procure drug connections. Weed is easy to find but having said that I&#039;m not in a medical state. It seems like a lot of people take quality control and consistency for granted (west coast US I&#039;m talking to you!).<br />SO...........I picked up some pot today. I was excited as everyone is, just grabbing a bit to keep the bottom of the jar covered. The last month or so my guy has been getting slightly better stuff each time I picked up. I don&#039;t mean real dank like I&#039;m sure many of you are getting but were talking about mid grade basically. Hardly ever a seed but it isn&#039;t anyone&#039;s definition of good. Anyways, I went over there expecting this upward shift in quality to continue. Much to my dismay the place smells more like cigarettes than weed and the stuff i got might be better off in my cooking. And I don&#039;t mean butter either. I&#039;m making pizza from scratch for lunch and I&#039;m real low on dried herbs. I like a thyme, oregano, sweet basil, and the like but this pot might be just the flavor I&#039;m looking for. <br />So whats the herb situation locally with you newbies?

				USA Northwest (&quot;Cascadia&quot;).<br /><br />Dank pot. Decent prices. 1/4 for 45-60 on street, obviously way better with solid connections.

				The Road is the answer to all of your dreams... just be safe and always think of your security first! The more layers of protection from the purchase to the receipt the better. So get a po box not directly connected to you. It costs around $10 bucks a month or so... If your only buying the herb and are a gambler, then using your home is an option. I wouldn&#039;t but it seems many are.<br />Second suggestion the less information about yourself the better. Just reading this post a few of you said where your from, don&#039;t be lazy and give LE links. I wouldn&#039;t say anything that could come back to bite you in the future. As far as the quality in&nbsp; my neck of the woods, An abundance, imagine walking into Willy Wonka&#039;s factory but instead of candy there was every type of God&#039;s medicine that you could imagine...

				In my area, there are all types of marijuana available.<br /><br />A lot of the poorer people are smoking, dealing, and trade very low quality stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s around $90-100/oz and is a dark nasty green with a disgusting sewage-like smell.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard as a rock, has lots of seeds, and is flat (almost looks like it was once crystally and was washed to make has and then re-dried and sold).&nbsp; Shit&#039;s gross, but it&#039;s everywhere.<br /><br />The majority of stuff is mid-grade.&nbsp; It can range from the price of schwag to the price of medical depending upon which area you get it from.&nbsp; Most college students are smoking this stuff now adays.&nbsp; It&#039;s super dry.&nbsp; This is what most of my friends end up with.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t messed with it much.<br /><br />Since the legalization in the states out west, we have been getting in some good medical stuff (indoor and outdoor).&nbsp; It has been what I&#039;ve been paying out of my ass to get for about a year now.&nbsp; It seems to come in from very few sources and I refuse to pay $20-25/g and was buying by the ounce at $340.&nbsp; No one seems to have steady supply, so bouncing around to dealers is required (and they bullshit and delay a lot).&nbsp; My first order here on the road was this quality bud at over $100 less per ounce.<br /><br />The extreme, high-quality, organicm etc. medical grade is unheard of here.&nbsp; Occasionally you can find a bowl pack of it from someone who paid out of the ass for a gram from a friend visiting from Colorado.
