				Ordering domestically, especially for small orders, will make the risk next to non-existent IMO. As long as it is packaged with at least some stealth of course.

				Just to give a little more perspective seldom - if you ordered 1g domestically, there is probably a 90% certainty (yes, I made that % up but what I mean is a very high certainty) that even if your letter is seized, the police will not come to you. The USPS will send you a lovely letter that they found narcotics in the mail and are taking it. &quot;If you have any additional information...blah blah blah.&quot; Never respond.<br /><br />Of course, I am sure there are situations where police do come out for small orders, but from reading the forums, it seems to be houses/apartments where there was already drug activity or suspicious activity going on. You have to realize that people on this site are buying 20G, 50G, 100G, KILOS (breaking bad type amounts) for their customers. The police really want the big fish, not the small little guys at the bottom. <br /><br />At the same time, I will tell you - never let your guard down. Always be suspicious and ask questions like these. Just trying to give you a little more clarity b/c I had the same concern when I joined.

				Spearwarrior, in a case where the only evidence is the defendant&#039;s self-incriminating statements, could the defendant claim that they were pressured to lie and to confess? Wouldn&#039;t that result in a smaller penalty than whatever they confessed to?

				From my experience ordering many small packages is better than a big package.&nbsp; I never keep much at the house either, enough so if I have to flush its no great loss.&nbsp; If the cops truly knew anything for sure they&#039;d have a warrant. Then its say nothing except I wanna talk to a lawyer.&nbsp; Some of these so called interviews they want to do with people are just talking tricks to get you to tell on yourself.&nbsp; Signing for packages is dangerous, by signing you take ownership of the package.&nbsp; Another LE trick is they spray the outside of the package with ultraviolet spray that can only be seen under a black light.&nbsp; Then, when you have it inside, they bust in, check it with the light, and the only prints on it are yours.&nbsp; Whenever I get shit I get rid of all packaging it came in. Hope this helps.<br />

				We used to get love letters from customs when ordering sticks from Argentina back in college. They were never followed up by any LE visits. Just a long running joke of, &quot;Got another love letter today!&quot; Ordering domestically should be of no worries. Hang in there and have faith...

				Nice to see that people generally aren&#039;t having issues with small quantities. One question though - doesn&#039;t the substance type affect the mail service and police&#039;s response? Or, do most forces really treat mail deliver of marijuana as they do methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine?

				Cops are liars.&nbsp; They&#039;ll say anything to try to get you to admit to something because alot of times they need an actual confession to make their case.&nbsp; They tried tripping me up in a so called interview several years back and I just said &quot;has a complaint been filed against me?&quot; &quot;Is there a warrant for my arrest?&quot; &quot;Am I under arrest?&quot; The answer to all my questions was no, so I got up and left.&nbsp; Course I changed up alot of things that day, and they couldn&#039;t bust me.

				I wouldn&#039;t flat-out deny it, saying you didn&#039;t order anything -- your safest option is to simply not talk to them -- talk to them via a lawyer. If you tell them &quot;I never ordered that&quot; and they (somehow) have evidence that you did, then you&#039;re up for not only the drugs, but lying to an officer as well (contempt of the law I think it is? I can&#039;t be bothered to google it). Just say as Tarnished recommended, &quot;I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about, and I&#039;m not answering any questions without a lawyer advising me.&quot;

				NEVER admit to ordering the stuff. If they come to talk to you (DON&#039;T go to them first!), just answer only the questions they ask you, and don&#039;t give any more information than that. Stick to &quot;yes&quot; / &quot;no&quot; answers and don&#039;t volunteer anything. They&#039;ll have to have the prosecutor&#039;s office prove in court that you ordered the shit and that will be VERY hard for them to do if you just say you have no idea why someone would be sending you drugs.

				Anyone can send you anything for any reason without your knowledge, if they try to get you to sign for something, deny that shit too! Who knows, maybe some terrorist is sending you anthrax! Better to be safe than sorry. Also Signing for the package could give probable cause to search your house, even if they can&#039;t charge you with the package (if you have a clean house) if you order something like weed (and they find a bong, rolling papers, other weed) then they can say they have a reason to believe you placed the order.

				Depends on what is seized. Lets say If it&#039;s only a gram of cocaine you should be fine, the worst case scenario that could happen to you is getting a letter saying your &#039;suspicious package has been seized and destroyed&#039; or something along those lines. I&#039;m not sure if they flag the house it was sent to if it&#039;s the first time drugs were found to be sent to that address. I know they do flag homes after they find drugs being sent to your home, so if your package gets seized, expect your home to be flagged (most likely) which will cause all packages from outside the country/state that are sent to you opened and thoroughly checked. (But that may not be the case, it all depends on the customs and if they are willing to waste their time on investigating you). And I don&#039;t think that happens very often with small shipments of drugs. If you order more than a gram, or an ounce of cocaine and it gets seized; get a lawyer ASAP.<br /><br />The best advice I can give anyone when ordering drugs in quantities larger than a gram, etc. (in ounces), is to find an abandoned house (not falling apart, but a house that is for lease or sale) and get all your drugs sent to that address under a fake name. After it arrives go and collect it from the mailbox, always watch for the law when going to collect the package, you never know. This is probably the oldest trick in the book when dealing with higher quantities of drugs, it removes some of the risk - but it may not always be the case. Or if you are extremely paranoid, pay someone to go and collect it for you from the mailbox; I&#039;m sure you&#039;d be able to find someone willing to collect a package for you for $10, just go and find some crackheads. (Maybe a bad example). Also make sure, you don&#039;t get too cocky and start getting delivered package, after package after package to the same address. Three times is usually enough - then switch, and so on. <br /><br />~ Cooler.<br /><br />

				Agree with everyone else. Don&#039;t tell police anything more than your name. Get a lawyer.

				If you believe&nbsp; this i have to friends who are cops one ex and the other homocide dective.Look up police budget for ammo they cant even afford to buy enough of it because their funds are so depleted.Look at the sad shape of our society we cant even pay our gov. workers IE&nbsp; our post office people.I would really not be concerned about your little 1 g package.Shit i wouldnt even be worried about larger amounts .Just be safe like many have said dont talk ever! Just i have no idea what you are talking about sir what&nbsp; am i being charged with (nothing) ok may i go about my business ? .Thats it .They will try many things to get you to open up your mouth.You are your own worst enemy.Keep saying am i being charged officer ? Even in cases where you are not doing anything illegal it can still fuck you up.Just say i dont want to get involved in this i have seen too much CSI and im afraid this somehow will get me into trouble when i have done nothing.Thank you officer and have a nice day<br /><br />If they really had some probable cause they would do a something of a drop of inert drugs and when you pick them up thats when they get you .But this has to be alot .Imagine your the lead officer on a bust with 10 or fully armed guys getting paid like 40 $ or more an hour ,detectives alot more an hour,servalence&nbsp; equiptment ,paddy wagons the whole lot and they finally catch some skinny kid waiting for his package open it up and its 1 gram of bud ,or whatever...Believe me somebody,s head and ass are going to roll! None of these agency,s have the money or manpower to go after it all so calm yourself and enjoy your bud or whatever.

				Kudos to all of the above, but as a retired Supreme Court Judge, my advice may be slightly different.<br />At the completion of the minute they have established to you their identity, immediately begin to undo your shoes, place them beside the wall, remove your socks and on top of your shoes, or beside, whatever you choose, (I mean we didn&#039;t fight all of them fucking wars for nothing did we?) fold up your socks. <br />&nbsp;Then as you continue to mutter any of the previously suggested described &#039;eat me&#039; scripts, pull off your shirt, fold it neatly and place that also in a nice bundle beside your shoes and socks. <br />&nbsp;Then, as you unbuckle your belt from your jeans, you may get from the police cops an unusual question along the lines of, <br />&quot;Sir/madam or tranny, why are you seeming to be getting undressed?&quot; to which you can quickly reply with gusto,<br />&quot;I am not! And I stand upon my record on that to prove it!&quot; at which point you must press &#039;play&#039; on the nearby CD player which will cause The Divinyls song, &#039;I Touch Myself&#039; to begin blaring out of all of the 1000 watt Marshall stacks (on 10) that you&#039;ve had built into the walls of your house for just such an occasion as this.<br />&nbsp;The authorit-eyes may be a little confused at your actions by now, but it is crucial here that you must grab the bottle of Transendental Cinnamon Zinger Spray Relaxation Massage Oil and commence spraying it over every part of your now naked body, whilst emphatically adding the question,<br />&quot;Aren&#039;t you sure you&#039;d like to join me my darlings, it&#039;s simply too much fun for just one?&quot;<br />&nbsp;You may at this point notice the junior officer get an excited glint in his eye, which, sadly, will be quickly exterminated by his more senior officer colleague&#039;s scowl as it&#039;s he who&#039;s seen it all before and knows it&#039;s nowhere near as much fun as you&#039;re making it out to be as you stand there, naked and running in little circles whilst rubbing yourself down with the heavily scented love oil, mouthing along to all the parts of the song, especially the bit where Chrissie sings,<br />&quot;When I think about you I touch myself&quot; at which time it&#039;s very essential&nbsp; for you to make eye contact with at least one of the police cops.<br />&nbsp; Running an ice cube containing thumb and forefinger round each of your nipples (and your third if you are so lucky) in a counter clockwise direction and leaning against one of your wall tapestries of Alexander the Great crossing the Andes by Elephant at the point of the song&#039;s completion is the time you need to start playing hardball with them.<br />Try to get an erection, if you don&#039;t already have one and ask them,<br />&quot;Now, I&#039;m sorry, I missed all that. What did you want again?&quot;

				I found a case where a guy received a package and threw it into the trash because he had been tipped off about LE discovering the package.&nbsp; His throwing the package away was used to prove &quot;constructive possession&quot; because it convinced a jury that he knew there were illicit drugs in the package.&nbsp; He got convicted.<br /><br />In another case a couple received a package and placed it in a couple of black bags and set it down in a mobile home they were staying in.&nbsp; No other drugs were found and they didn&#039;t talk.&nbsp; They got convicted, mainly because (1) they had the tracking number written down and (2) placing the package into multiple black bags helped to prove constructive possession.<br /><br />Most people here aren&#039;t getting into trouble because of these things: (1) they buy domestic which is harder to catch.&nbsp; (2) east coast customs isn&#039;t checking packages and they just aren&#039;t having any bad luck that their package went through the xray.&nbsp; (3) small amounts and you get a love letter (note: a small amount is 1g not 28g).<br /><br />If you get a controlled delivery then chances are you&#039;re fucked.&nbsp; Very few people have a delivery address that is clean and has a person that won&#039;t talk after being told they are going to jail.&nbsp; The police will put you into jail for simple having a package delivered and they&#039;ll let the DA/jury figure out if you&#039;re guilty or not.&nbsp; Making bail and hiring a decent attorney can be very expensive.&nbsp; The process can take a long time.&nbsp; Oh and police will not hesitate to claim that you said things that you didn&#039;t.&nbsp; If they think you&#039;re guilty then they justify it to themselves I guess.&nbsp; They want to &quot;win.&quot;

				Just act dumb and you have no idea what they&#039;re talking about. A package came under your name. You saw your name got curious, who wouldn&#039;t get curious if something came under the persons name. If they come on a control delivery just keep in mind that they might know about the others also. Cops they like to fuck people in the ass and one package isn&#039;t enough unless it was a big one. So acting dumb and deny might not work.

				Ask them if you are being arrested. If you are under arrest say that you would like to exercise your 5th amendment rights and will not be speaking to them without your lawyer. If you are not under arrest tell them you are not interested in answering any questions and are done talking with them.
