				...well, is there?&nbsp; Those stupid creams and shit on clearnet are scams.&nbsp; d-penicillamine seems promising...but it suppresses the immune system and that seems a bit risky.&nbsp; Let me know knowledgeable people.

				I&#039;ve no idea if any drug will work so I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t the response you&#039;re after but small breasts are awesome... seriously! Society is bullshit, little boobs are just as hot (way more imo) as big ones.

				i dont think so. if there was i think it would be well known because so many girls are unhappy with the breast size<br />i think the only way to get them bigger in cup sizes is to have them done surgically or get pregnant<br />small boobs are awesome imo. almost all small boobs look good and perky. only a small fraction of big boobs look good in real life.<br />be thankful you dont have big saggy titties

				10K?&nbsp; pfft you can get that shit done around here from a decent surgeon for 3-4000 and I think we have enough disturbed individuals(myself included) that would do it.<br /><br />look at the Best Boobs of SR.&nbsp; Grand Prize was over 1k and only 5 women submitted photos.<br /><br />only issue would be concealing identity because youd see before and afters which could be hosted on doctors website or time of surgery etc

				I like having smaller boobs because then I can wear really low cut stuff or show my bra and not give a shit. While people might think I&#039;m a little slutty (until they get to know me), at least they know I&#039;m not trying to show off some DDs just to get attention.
