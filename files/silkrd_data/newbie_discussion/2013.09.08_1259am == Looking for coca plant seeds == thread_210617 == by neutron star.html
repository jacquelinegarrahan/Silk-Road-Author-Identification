				I&#039;ve seen them for sale somewhere recently.&nbsp; They were either on the Road,or Black Market Reloaded . I saw them on one of these sites and I&#039;m pretty sure it was BMR. I think they are more like berries than seeds , and, you need the right climate , the shit only grows in the Andes if I&#039;m not mistaken. Good luck.

				I have always thought about this, people say they only grow here and there but the truth gots to be that any envoriment can be copied and even the poppyfields would probably be possible to replicate the envoriment to make a indoor poppyfield..<br /><br />I have never heard of anyone doing it ever tho so please write the results later on I know alot of people wanna know if it works inside.<br /><br />Shure it might be the gridlines and energies that enables them to grow in only specific areas only.. i don&#039;t know yet but its interesting.

				Yup, they are on BMR . Vendor name is Organix&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the link for the listing:<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=view_listing&amp;id=15755<br /><br />I really think unless you live up high in the Andes that your up shits creek as far as growing viable plants though. Even if you could grow them, you would need a shitload of them to be of use if your looking to try making coke. If you just want to chew them, then you can just buy the leaves on the Road in the cocaine section. I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re legal too, depending on where you live.

Even if ya could grow it though, it takes a lot of plants to be enough to make coke, not something you will do in a basement hydro operation.

				Thanks for all your information&#039;s guys. <br />In recent days, the theme is gone down slightly. Haven&#039;t had the time and muse for it.
