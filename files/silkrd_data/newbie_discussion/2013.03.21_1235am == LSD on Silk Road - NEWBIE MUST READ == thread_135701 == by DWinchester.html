				So... I am new to SR and a little nervous about purchasing on here.&nbsp; After reading lots of literature and books on the subject of LSD and the great minds that used it on a regular basis I decided I must try it.&nbsp; Try finding LSD and you can&#039;t.&nbsp; I asked family members that go to college and they can get Ecstasy and things like that but I want to stay away from those chemicals.&nbsp; LSD has been used in the treatment of alcoholism and various other therapeutic treatments.&nbsp; So here is where my adventure begins.<br /><br />I first buy from AlbertHoffman1943 and nothing ever arrives.&nbsp; He/She asks if I gave my correct address, used my real name, etc, etc.&nbsp; Of course it had to be my fault as a Newbie.&nbsp; As a test I buy from another vendor MidnightBlue.&nbsp; To much appreciation my order arrives, stealth as ever!&nbsp; I almost had to write to him/her and ask where it was!&nbsp; So I go back to the previous vendor and explain that there seems to be no problem with my address.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard as a Newbie to buy as some vendors require FE if you have less than 5 transactions and who wants to waste valuable and currently EXPENSIVE Bitcoins on books and such.&nbsp; Then there are those vendors that I think prey on Newbies.&nbsp; Then there is the problem with consistency.&nbsp; &nbsp;MidnightBlue doesn&#039;t have any LSD available so I am looking for a consistent vendor.&nbsp; I hear and have read a lot about JCash98 as having a solid connection but once again do not want to waste valuable Bitcoins buying into his/her lotto.&nbsp; I understand his/her philosophy on the matter but I don&#039;t care to possibly win free LSD tabs, I am willing to pay for my order.&nbsp; I write to JCash98 who seems to really know how to run a business and is efficient but buying in as a bulk customer is a bit more than I could ever possibly use (I am not interested in selling, just sharing with friends).&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to work something out and if I do will update.<br /><br />For now, I would suggest buying from MidnightBlue as I have never tried LSD but my husband has and was really impressed.&nbsp; One tab each and it was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; Had 1/2 a tab 3 hours later and things really got going.&nbsp; I read all over how first time trippers should stay away from large crowds but I wanted to be outdoors and had an amazing experience.&nbsp; We went to see The Doors cover band Wild Child at the Whiskey in Hollywood and had a great time!!!&nbsp; After the show we walked miles, and miles and it felt like nothing.&nbsp; Then my husband explained how it would be nearly impossible to fall asleep.&nbsp; After some intense sex, he was wrong.&nbsp; He slept like a baby as did I.&nbsp; First dose was at 2:00 pm and 1/2 hit was added at 5:00 pm.&nbsp; First time having sex was at 2:30 am and again at 11:30 am.&nbsp; He had warned me that LSD gives a man the libido and erection of a 19 year old and he was right!!!!Fantastic is all I can say.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t fall asleep until 4:00 am but we were awake by 11:30 am and felt incredibly rested.&nbsp; <br /><br />The amount of compassion and love I felt on this very first trip of mine was overwhelming.&nbsp; It made me wish everyone was on it to feel like I was.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what others are expecting as I didn&#039;t see tunnels but I found myself noticing multiple things at once and colors seemed more vibrant.&nbsp; Birds were elegant and the tree leaves felt so alive.&nbsp; My husband said it must have been very clean LSD as it didn&#039;t give him cramps, keep him up longer than desired and felt great the next day.&nbsp; Quality is everything so for now I can only recommend MidnightBlue.&nbsp; I just placed a new order with No Fe ever as MidnightBlue was out.&nbsp; I will update if this vendor turns out to be a winner as well.&nbsp; I will then write another trip report once I have tested this vendor&#039;s LSD.&nbsp; To date I have received nothing from AlbertHoffman1943.<br /><br />I hope this helps other Newbies!<br /><br />Blessings.<br />&nbsp;

				Hey there. Like you, my first acid came to me from SR. Also like you, I got scammed the first time I ordered. I was too eager to get my hands on lucy, so I FE&#039;d and got burned. No one ever has to FE, though - not even noobs. There are many reliable acid vendors on the Road that don&#039;t require anyone to FE. Check out this thread to learn everything about buying acid on SR: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Happy trails~&nbsp;

				I am new to SR and even newer on the forum.&nbsp; I had no idea what the forum was and was buying blindly and have been ripped off more than once.&nbsp; I appreciate the trip tales and would appreciate feedback on the NO FE you are now buying from.&nbsp; BTC are way expensive so I don&#039;t want to throw them away so take the time to post, it is appreciated!&nbsp; I would send you some good karma if I knew how.

				Check the Avengers LSD Review thread in the rumor mill section, it is probably the best place to find which vendors are legitimate and trustworthy.

				Thanks for the links and the other helpful hints.&nbsp; I realize all this is illegal but we can still act like a community and help each other out&nbsp; :D<br />I am checking out the links and the vendors recommended.&nbsp; Like I said, I am quite pleased with the one MidnightBlue and am currently waiting for my package from No FE Ever.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard his product was good and that he (I dislike using only male forms of English) was legit.&nbsp; I will be sure to write here again once received so that we as a community can add another safe and reliable vendor to the list of good ones.&nbsp; Fingers crossed.

				That Avengers thread will come in handy A LOT. Thank you!<br /><br />PS: don&#039;t hate MDxx, there&#039;s a lot of junk on the streets sold as MDxx, but some nice clean MDMA can be a great experience in the right setting (and especially with the right company, like your husband). It&#039;s a really nice empathogenic drug :)

				To DWinchester: you really are something else. I must&#039;ve responded to 25 of your messages costing me close to 2 hours of my time - and for what? So can call me a scammer?? And the reshipment that I sent....2 of my packages get sent and nothing arrives?<br /><br />There are over 135 other orders that I fulfilled, all of whom gave me amazing feedback, plus the thread my customers started here in the forums that talks about how good my service, shipping and product is, and you think I would scam a newbie like you for a mere $100??? <br /><br />To anyone who cares about LSD, please don&#039;t listen to this person - I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with her but there is something very off. Visit the LSD Avengers in the Rumor Mill section of the forums to see what&#039;s what about LSD here on SR. They are like a consumer protection group for LSD. Go see what they have to say about me....and crawl through these forums to read reviews of my products and service. <br /><br />Take what you read from lone individuals here with a grain of salt: read the feedback that a vendor has and run their name through the search box at the top right of every page here, to read product reviews and get a general sense of their reputation. If you do so with my name, you will see that this person is the only one calling me a scammer.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135701.msg921928#msg921928">Quote from: DWinchester on March 21, 2013, 12:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So...

				Hey there DWinchester.... The Wild Child band has been around for ever it seems like... haha much longer than the Doors ever were.... now that is a trip..... I have never seen them but here they put on a pretty good show...<br /><br />Glad your first experience with acid was a good one... it can change your life and will if you let it....<br /><br />Thanks for the trip report.... Does anyone know if there is a thread dedicated just for trip reports... I know of the Avengers thread but that has all kinds of information and people arguing over potency and all that jazz....<br /><br />I would love one just for trip reports.....<br /><br />mm

				This is in response to AlbertHoffman1943 who rips off NEWBIES!!&nbsp; I have nothing to hide but newbies have everything to lose if you buy from this vendor!!!<br /><br />Here is his recent email to me:<br />AlbertHoffman1943(99) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i see that you gave me 1/5 rating and i wanted to write you to ask you to revise it to a 5/5. i&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t know how the system works here so i&#039;ll explain it - a 1/5 rating is for when you were ripped off and treated like shit by the vendor.<br />i assume you didnt get your orders since i never heard back from you but if one thing is for sure, i bent over backwards trying to make it work for you. i spend so much time writing you and communicating with you beyond having sent the orders, that i think it&#039;s only fair that you do me better than a 1/5. if you look, the one other customer (out of nearly 140) who didnt get his package, still gave me a 5/5 because of the customer service i gave him. for what i did for you, i would hope you would do the same and explain your disappointment in the comments. thx<br /><br />and here is my response to him:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven&#039;t been on here for awhile so I am just reading this today, 4/18.<br /><br />You were the first vendor I purchased from and yet the only one where the package did not show up...TWICE!!!<br /><br />Your customer service may be good but it wasn&#039;t your customer service I was purchasing. If I wanted to go back-and-forth and email someone I would write my mother.<br /><br />You seem to forget that I had to spend quite a bit of time writing to you...Are you going to pay me $100 in Bitcoins? I&#039;m not spending anymore time as I have spent more than enough in complaining/corresponding/emailing with you.<br /><br />Let me say this one last time. I had NO problems with various other vendors except for you. One time is believable but TWICE! Be grateful for the one person who still gave you a 5/5 just because of your emails but I am not lonely or looking for an email partner.<br /><br />Take care.<br /><br />SO...as you can see unless you want to give a vendor over $100 because he/she will write you stall tactic emails and have NOTHING show up, I can assure you better karma if you simply send me your hard earned money.&nbsp; Needless to say, my 1/5 will remain as I am unable to give him/her what is really deserved... 0.<br /><br />Why risk it when there are others that have ZERO negative reviews.

				DWinchester (or MommaDJobs or whatever her name is) is back at it again. The lone customer calling me a scammer after over 150 successful sales - and for the monster amount of $100, nearly two months ago!!<br /><br />Follow this link (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/008ce4c43c) to visit my profile so you can read the hundreds of positive feedback comments and 5/5 ratings.<br /><br />Follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94316.0) to visit the trip reports thread on my products, which my customers started, not me.<br /><br />Follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0) to read the LSD Avengers vendor review of me (they are the consumer report group on LSD here btw and very good at what they do)<br /><br />And follow this link (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=56814) to read DWinchester&#039;s posts here in this community. They are very informative about her personality. <br /><br />And finally, she is also on the vendor blacklist due to her complete fucked-upedness. <br /><br />Listen to her at your peril!<br /><br />Nuff said!<br /><br />

Also, thank you gwendlesphere for the shit list :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not about how trustworthy (well it is with bulk buys and sharing information), it&#039;s more about how much of a reliable buyer you are in that you have to have a very negligible refund rate and auto-finalize rate, so they know when they do business with you, they are dealing with someone who doesn&#039;t demand their money back, or who pays on time. The higher your transaction rate, obviously the less likely it is you&#039;re some kind of DEA fag, but also it means you&#039;re a frequent shopper.<br /><br />But never FE for anyone, not even if it&#039;s your very first buy<br /><br />If it is a trustworthy vendor (top &lt;5% or 95+% positive feedback), and they request you FE under a certain amount of transactions, just simply send them a message explaining you&#039;re new and still want to try some of their product, and just be polite about it. 9/10 they will happily deal with you and help you work up your stats.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t buy bulk loads of drugs with no stats and expect them to understand you&#039;re just a newbie testing it out. That is suspicious.<br /><br />Just be polite, everyone is human, send them a message, and normally they&#039;ll help you or direct you where to go if they are unable to help.<br /><br />NEVER FE FOR FIRST TIME BUSINESS WITH A VENDOR.<br /><br />If you have bought lots of them and trust them as a vendor, then FE by all means. They&#039;ll appreciate it. But if you don&#039;t know them and you&#039;re unsure, move right along.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Also, doesn&#039;t hurt to buy eBooks and stuff like that for 0.01BTC just to get stats up, but be honest about it.

				onion.to is a redirecting service... I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scam...

I am new to SR and a little nervous about purchasing on here.&nbsp; After reading lots of literature and books on the subject of LSD and the great minds that used it on a regular basis I decided I must try it.&nbsp; Try finding LSD and you can&#039;t.&nbsp; I asked family members that go to college and they can get Ecstasy and things like that but I want to stay away from those chemicals.&nbsp; LSD has been used in the treatment of alcoholism and various other therapeutic treatments.&nbsp; So here is where my adventure begins.<br /><br />I first buy from AlbertHoffman1943 and nothing ever arrives.&nbsp; He/She asks if I gave my correct address, used my real name, etc, etc.&nbsp; Of course it had to be my fault as a Newbie.&nbsp; As a test I buy from another vendor MidnightBlue.&nbsp; To much appreciation my order arrives, stealth as ever!&nbsp; I almost had to write to him/her and ask where it was!&nbsp; So I go back to the previous vendor and explain that there seems to be no problem with my address.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard as a Newbie to buy as some vendors require FE if you have less than 5 transactions and who wants to waste valuable and currently EXPENSIVE Bitcoins on books and such.&nbsp; Then there are those vendors that I think prey on Newbies.&nbsp; Then there is the problem with consistency.&nbsp; &nbsp;MidnightBlue doesn&#039;t have any LSD available so I am looking for a consistent vendor.&nbsp; I hear and have read a lot about JCash98 as having a solid connection but once again do not want to waste valuable Bitcoins buying into his/her lotto.&nbsp; I understand his/her philosophy on the matter but I don&#039;t care to possibly win free LSD tabs, I am willing to pay for my order.&nbsp; I write to JCash98 who seems to really know how to run a business and is efficient but buying in as a bulk customer is a bit more than I could ever possibly use (I am not interested in selling, just sharing with friends).&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to work something out and if I do will update.<br /><br />For now, I would suggest buying from MidnightBlue as I have never tried LSD but my husband has and was really impressed.&nbsp; One tab each and it was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; Had 1/2 a tab 3 hours later and things really got going.&nbsp; I read all over how first time trippers should stay away from large crowds but I wanted to be outdoors and had an amazing experience.&nbsp; We went to see The Doors cover band Wild Child at the Whiskey in Hollywood and had a great time!!!&nbsp; After the show we walked miles, and miles and it felt like nothing.&nbsp; Then my husband explained how it would be nearly impossible to fall asleep.&nbsp; After some intense sex, he was wrong.&nbsp; He slept like a baby as did I.&nbsp; First dose was at 2:00 pm and 1/2 hit was added at 5:00 pm.&nbsp; First time having sex was at 2:30 am and again at 11:30 am.&nbsp; He had warned me that LSD gives a man the libido and erection of a 19 year old and he was right!!!!Fantastic is all I can say.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t fall asleep until 4:00 am but we were awake by 11:30 am and felt incredibly rested.&nbsp; <br /><br />The amount of compassion and love I felt on this very first trip of mine was overwhelming.&nbsp; It made me wish everyone was on it to feel like I was.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what others are expecting as I didn&#039;t see tunnels but I found myself noticing multiple things at once and colors seemed more vibrant.&nbsp; Birds were elegant and the tree leaves felt so alive.&nbsp; My husband said it must have been very clean LSD as it didn&#039;t give him cramps, keep him up longer than desired and felt great the next day.&nbsp; Quality is everything so for now I can only recommend MidnightBlue.&nbsp; I just placed a new order with No Fe ever as MidnightBlue was out.&nbsp; I will update if this vendor turns out to be a winner as well.&nbsp; I will then write another trip report once I have tested this vendor&#039;s LSD.&nbsp; To date I have received nothing from AlbertHoffman1943.<br /><br />I hope this helps other Newbies!<br /><br />Blessings.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i am waiting for a vendor with LSD bottles there is one in canada but he is too expensive and i live in the eu ^^ i would never ever order from canada ... i mean i got a order from pakistan after 3 weeks :D but it came haha ... ITALY had lsd bottles but he dont have them up no more and this dude is kinda strange i dont know i think there is a threat about him and bulldogg or bulldoggistheboss and so on lol dont know but lol i ordered from him 2 times once mdpv 1 gram haha never again ... the stuff is just too strong xD no drug for me ... and i ordered AD ( he writes AM ) but i got AD / 30mg IR after 3 weeks very nice ^^ so i hope he has his lsd bottles up again soon .... and i hope he ships them from italy ^^&nbsp; <br /><br />and i have seen there is a new vendor who will sell LSD bottles .... 100 drops

				Hey Newbies....welcome to forums and to SR.&nbsp; You&#039;re already doing it right by reading the fourms and doing your research.&nbsp; <br /><br />You still need to figure out who&#039;s reliable and who&#039;s opinions you can trust&nbsp; &nbsp;The Karma rating and the 50 post rule will help you there but are not foolprool by any means.&nbsp; The avengers thread is a must read for anyone looking to score some Lucy and avoid being scammed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Most importantly don&#039;t feel you have to&nbsp; FE because it&#039;s the only way a vendor will accept your order.....find another vendor who will work with you if FE is required.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now is one of the best times if quality LSD is what you seek.&nbsp; &nbsp;My personal favorite is a vendor named JesusofRave or JoR for short.&nbsp; He is one of the best on the SR and his following only grows as more buyers learn of him and his ways.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/53555a9222<br /><br />Do him a favor and read all the information to find an answer to any question you migh have.&nbsp; If you still have a question you can trust that JoR is a great communicator either by his pm&#039;s or&nbsp; on his forum thread.&nbsp; He has 3 of them that I know of.&nbsp; &nbsp; His word is his bond and you can trust in what he tells you.<br />****Looking for some of the best LSD on the road??&nbsp; Well you are in Luck because he just listed the last of his current batch of Liquid LSD that is nicknamed ToC.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />It is amazing stuff and in almost everyone&#039;s opinion some of the BEST ON SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was definitely made with some high quality crystal with love to turn on the world.&nbsp; And thanks to SR and JoR it really is.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are scared of dealing with LSD in it&#039;s Liquid form then he does have blotters too but it&#039;s not made with the ToC.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t want a full vial then you have options of 1/2 vial or even a 1/4 to fit your needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s so good that alot who have&nbsp; gotten a whole&nbsp; have already gone back for more when it became available.&nbsp; <br /><br />His shipping is fantastic and his success rates are as close to 100% delivered as you can get.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t believe me....read the reviews.&nbsp; &nbsp;This guy is the real deal.<br /><br />Oh and he ships to most anywhere as far as I know.&nbsp; &nbsp;He isn&#039;t saying NO to the USA&nbsp; like a certain vendor who can&#039;t seem to get pkgs delivered there and who now lists USA as a banned country.&nbsp; &nbsp;Come on what does that say.....it&#039;s one of the easiest substances to get through.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are scared of international then you can find another vendor who is domestic to you but SERIOUSLY you shouldn&#039;t let an international shipment cause you to miss this guy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again read what others say about this.<br /><br />Starting to ramble and didn&#039;t mean to post this long...... hope it helps.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				I feel that most people should be less conscious about ordering LSD internationally. You will have more options, and LSD is literally paper so what the fuck could really happen (unless the packaging has been profiled, which is why some vendors will change it with time).

				My first order was international all my orders have been. I only go with UK vendors for international orders due to the high amounts of mail coming in from the UK to AUS due to the vast amount living in AUS &amp; vice versa, not US but I would imagine it&#039;s a similar situation ;-)<br /><br />Iv&#039;e ordered some Mayans from Jor, I wonder If anyone has anything to say about them &amp; potentially there comparison to Jor&#039;s TOC?<br />I&#039;ll hopefully get them in a week. Excited :-)<br /><br />Any links to reviews on Jor&#039;s Mayan 180ug&#039;s<br />still might be a bit early. Jor did say that he had sent out 1000&#039;s so there should be some reviews by now.<br />Peace.

				I am even more amazed how LSD gets lost! I have no trouble with various products delivered, but I&#039;ve lost two consignments of less than 10 blotters in 2 months from HIGHLY reputable vendors. The same vendors have shipped more bulky product with no issues. In each case, I&#039;ve taken the hit at full cost to me and FE&#039;d to protect my relatively new stats, but what&#039;s the story with blotter goings missing? Perhaps they are so small, and the vendors are so mad out of it, they just omit them? Another in the pipeline at the moment. I seriously hope it comes through.

				Very true Excalibured! We&#039;re talking 500km here across a single common border, so without being country specific, it&#039;s not a case of LE in this case. Bulky product gets through, but 5 or 10 blotters don&#039;t! I too hope that it&#039;s not a case of &#039;sure this is too small, I couldn&#039;t be bothered&#039;. Will update.

				The delicate nature of the LSD molecule needs to be considered, especially now that it&#039;s warmed up quite a bit (here, at least).<br /><br />I bought a few tabs (200ug) from tesselated a while ago, dropped both, 2 hrs apart from each other, and felt nothing at all. I decided not to make a big fuss about it, given the vendors track record. I&#039;m pretty sure that during the journey from Canada to the UK they must have got a bit toasty, and all but degraded completely. If you ask me, you&#039;re best bet is always to pick a vendor that&#039;s close to home.

				You might have been unlucky enough to get a couple of blotters that were at the edge of a page when hastily dipped. True, it degrades with heat / light, but I discovered a couple of blotters in the middle of a hard copy book that was shelved for 5 years. For fun, myself &amp; a friend one Saturday night decided to give them a go expecting as much as if we ingested our bus tickets.. instead we had a wonderful night :) Dry, cool, dark, ... seems that&#039;s all that LSD wants.

				Wow xtmg, I&#039;m surprised that you are even here - but you know what? Take it at your own pace. Yes, do read all the stories and experiences here. They will provide you with a wealth of insight and information should you decide to eventually try anything. I have no doubt that your SR readings will leave you in a more informed and a far safer decision making mode should you ever, or not as the case may be, take it upon yourself to explore one of these journeys. There&#039;s a mass of information here to help you make safe and informed decisions.

Certainly made me curious about psychedelics. But, problem is, I&#039;ve always been concerned there might be repercussions down the line.
