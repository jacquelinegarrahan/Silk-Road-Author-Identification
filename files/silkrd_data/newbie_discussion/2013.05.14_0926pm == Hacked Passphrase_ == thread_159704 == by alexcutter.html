				Hi all,<br /><br />SF was working fine earlier this morning, until I was &quot;disconnected&quot;.<br /><br />I tried to reconnect several times without success. I noticed that the Tor update icon was flashing, and updated.<br /><br />Still no luck logging in. I tried on my other computer (both are Macs running latest OS and latest Tor). No luck.<br /><br />I tried creating a new SR account, and have been able to log in successfully.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming someone figured out my passphrase, switched it out, and has locked my out of my account. Is that a fair assumption to make?<br /><br />If so, do I have any recourse?<br /><br />thx in advance.

				If that is the case, you will need to start a new account and message SR Support from that new account.&nbsp; Let them know that you&#039;re locked out of your account, and they will help get the password reset.&nbsp; It would also help to provide them as much info as you can to help prove that the account in question does indeed belong to you.&nbsp; (I think they may ask for the BTC address you used for your last deposit.)

				My account was just hacked last week. The crooks canceled all my pending orders, hacked my PIN number and stole my BTC. Sorry this happened to you also. I tried to warn the community but no one would believe me&nbsp; :-\

				SR is secure, only way you got hacked is if you were not looking after your own account.<br />You should rein-format your computer, you might have a keylogger.
