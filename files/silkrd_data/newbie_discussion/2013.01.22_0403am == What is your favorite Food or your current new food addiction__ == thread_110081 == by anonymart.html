I left my local gyro joint less than satisfied last time, but the place is legendary so I know it must have been a fluke.

				I love gyros, too, guys. Hardly anybody does it right tho. Gotta have good meat, but also keep the cone at a delicate distance/temp. I usually order 2-3 gyros if I find a good place. <br /><br />Another thing... making hummus. Cheap as all hell to make, better than most store bought anyway.
