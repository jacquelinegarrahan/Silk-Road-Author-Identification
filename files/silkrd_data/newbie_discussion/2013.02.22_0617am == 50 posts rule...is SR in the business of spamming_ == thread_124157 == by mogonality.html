				Yeah, sure, these aren&#039;t difficult captchas to crack for most captcha-cracking software, but the easiest way to break them is to have a human solve them. Maybe every post on this forum = spam in the clearnet.

				Meaning, hypothetically, that the SR forum server, through whatever proxy creates a user account/attempts to post spam on some public server, then when it is given a CAPTCHA to fill out, forwards it to forum-post CAPTCHAs, verifies that the user has provided the correct answer, then allows the post to go through *and* spams some poor other message board.<br /><br />Not saying this is happening, but I mean, consider the environment.<br /><br />Also, yes, this is all spam. Hopefully just SR forum spam, but whatever. Post to 50!
