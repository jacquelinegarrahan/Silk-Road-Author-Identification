				Any tips on dealing with a nosey landlord?<br />I live with him and rent a room.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He won&#039;t allow me to change the locks, and he knows my previous address was a rehab center. <br />&nbsp;The other day i was visably fucked up when i left a line chalked up on a table in my room and stepped out to get a smoke when i heard him say to him say to his wife, just go in and look around don&#039;t touch anything. They never told me anything itabout it. It wouldn&#039;t suprise me if they are trying to kick me out to jack up the rent. But its my understanding that in my state that the landlord is legally required to give me a 24 hour written notice if they want to enter my room for any <br />reason. I&#039;ve also made sure to

				I think you need to look for somewhere else to live, with a landlord who has a more relaxed attitude. Of course you could catch him going into your room unannounced, but then he could catch you taking drugs. So it&#039;s a bit of a no win situation. It&#039;s not like his suspicions are unfounded and surely living with such a person will just lead to paranoia and mistrust.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t you have a key to your room so that you can close it?<br /><br />This is the simplest thing to do, however remember this: if you close your room up nosey people will just become even more interested in what&#039;s there. The best course of action is to simply let them do what they want to do and ignore them for some time. After a while if they don&#039;t find nothing of interest they will simply stop to do it. If you give a motivation for these sort of people to suspect about something they will literally turn your life into hell.<br /><br />Simply play strategically. For example willingly go away from home with the door wide open leaving nothing to find. You know that they will go in and search around, and you do this appositely for them to do so. When you are home, in the same way, keep the door open so they will naturally watch inside. Naturally to do this until they are bored to look at you, you will have to be sure you are not doing anything of illegal or that you don&#039;t want them to know. If you want to do so then you will have to lock the door, but this will naturally make their curiosity go sky-high and will worsen the thing.<br /><br />In any case rest assured that nosey people will never change. Or you go elsewhere or you will have to face this trouble every time you do something that re-builds their suspects. For many people doing these things is all they have in life. To really let them not bother you anymore you will have to do something to make them have fear of yourself, but this will naturally mean that you will have no more an home in a short time if you have not something to, sort of, &quot;blackmail&quot; them so that they cannot make you go away without repercussion (this can also be tied to the &quot;fear method&quot; you use, but beware of it not being an illegal one or in the case that it&#039;s not directly tied to yourself). <br /><br />I lived once in a room with two very strict Jehovah Witnesses room-mates that gave me the same problem. It was very simple to handle them: I just let them find occult paraphernalia in my room with a &quot;secret diary&quot; (naturally created ad-hoc) of how many people I turned life hell ritually with the help of Satan. They had so much fear of me doing the same with them that they left me alone for the remaining of the time I was there. They had even too much fear of even sending me away for fear of a repercussion, nor they had anything legal to work against me (actually they tried going to the police with an &quot;anonymous&quot; snip that I was a &quot;Satanist child murderer&quot; but naturally nothing was farther from the truth and the thing just fired back to them).<br /><br />So your choises are really only three: or you lock your room and you bear them for the remainder of your time in the house (or the similar strategic play of making them search until they are bored, but in this case you will have to always do so for all the duration of your residence there), or you leave (probably the easiest choice) to find better room-mates, or you find something with which they will be so much afraid of you that they will leave you alone without sending you away (this is the most difficult of the three but if you can do it, it is both very fun and a way to don&#039;t come to compromises with yourself; but, as I said, beware that the fear is not build up by illegal methods or if it is it&#039;s not tied directly to yourself, you must study something intelligent).

				yeah leave a webcam recording and leave the door open as suggested above.<br />After that you can use the record against them if they catch you with drugs.<br /><br />Or just don&#039;t do drugs there :)

				The guy sounds like a dick, no way should he been going into your locked room. Best bet is to have a talk with him and get it all out in the open. Then if hes still unhappy move. Webcam /hidden camera thing is a little bit of a comical over-escalation of a minor problem

				if it&#039;s easy enough for you to do I reckon the web cam is a very good idea.&nbsp; Simply he&#039;s not allowed to enter your room without giving you 24hours notice = he&#039;s not allowed to enter your room without telling you.<br /><br />If he were to enter your room and say, find drugs, he &#039;might&#039; try and use this against you, however if you can show he entered your room &#039;illegally&#039; you stand a good or at least much better chance of talking your way out of any dramas he might try to initiate from what he sees/saw<br /><br />just my 14 satoshis bro ;)<br /><br /><br />m m m motek

				Ive decided to get a webcam and a locked stash box. I will keep the box either in my room or my car, alternating between them althought i hate keeping drugs in my car. Maybe even leave the box out unlocked with nothing in it and a note on my monitor that says smile your on camera and a print out of the tennant rights laws for my area, just to fuck with him. If i get him on tape going into my room i will make sure every thing is pristine in my room and confront him. also im going to restrict my time high to when he is out of the house.

				I gotta say, I think its not cool to keep drugs in a house with roommates who do not want them there.&nbsp; It can open them up to liability and problems with the law.&nbsp; I know you are calling him your &quot;landlord&quot;, but you are really renting a room in his house.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I gotta agree with Bennet4545.<br /><br />While as a fellow drug user I sympathise with your situation I can also see that a lot of non drug users are not going to be very happy with the idea of having what they might think is a &#039;drug addict&#039; in their home.<br /><br />I guess you and your landlord and his wife are not a good fit as roommates so it&#039;s going to make a very stressful situation for all of you.<br /><br />Any chance you could find another place to live where you&#039;d feel more comfortable?

				Move in with me lol! i am looking to move soon and i dont give a FUCK what people do, hell you sound like a chill ass roomate if youd ask me haha i be doin lines with ya, but yeah on a more serious note, maybe a setup a nannycam but dont catch yourself doing anything illegal that could come back to bite ya in the ass later on, and in the meantime, tone your usage down to keep the peace, maybe do him a few faovrs now and then as well, order&nbsp; some pizza on you Friday night, or do his dishes etc... look for a new place live alone or find a friend you know it cool to room with. This cannot go on because it will only get worse for both of you.

				This is terriable advice but its 100% true. If you are looking for sketchy room mates go find people on craigslist. Just be careful that they are not too sketchy...you&#039;re looking for a slightly sketchy person.
