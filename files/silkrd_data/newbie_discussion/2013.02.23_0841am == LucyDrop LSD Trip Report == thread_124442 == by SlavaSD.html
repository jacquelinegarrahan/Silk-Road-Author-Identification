				Hi, i want to share my tripreport here. I&#039;ve ordered 10 strip from LD. I got the letter after 18 days to middle east. I have no torelance to LSD, it will be my first time&nbsp; but i did shrooms 30+ times in the past. I&#039;ve read some complains about the quality of his last batches, so i started with 3 strip with empty stomach (last meal 6 hours ago). I started to feel the effect after 20 minutes and got to the peak probably after 1-2 hours. I was indoors at onset, i had some body temperature discomfort, feeling cold especially hands. But when i reach the peak, everything was great OEV and CEV. I had my friend babysitting me, so i told him that we should go out for a walk. We went outside and i had a lot of energy, amplified colors, trails and voices everywhere. We probably walked like 10 km in the center of the city,&nbsp; drank a coffee with milk and rasberry syrup at starbucks and had a lot of fun.<br />Overall it was a 5/5 trip, thanks LucyDrop. After 7 hours, i decided to take 2mg clonazepam, because it was enough experience and i needed to sleep. It was a good decision, i&#039;ve slept well, woke up with a smily face and writing this trip report now.<br />I need a breakfast now :) peace!

				Hi, this is the second trip report of my 10 strip order from LucyDrop.<br /><br />I told my first trip to a co-worker and he wanted to try L too, but he was a little bit scared.<br />Yesterday he told me that he thought about it a lot and decided to try it. He called me and came to my place at 8:30 pm.<br />I showed him 7 strip that i have and his first reaction was &quot;wtf will it make us high,its so small?&quot;, i smiled and gave him 3 and 1/2 blotter and<br />&nbsp;i took the same amount too. We were listening to chillout music, laughed a lot. A good old friend joined us and i offered him vodka.<br />So 2 acidheads and a vodka drinking fat man with mustache in the house how can this trip be bad huh? :)<br />After 3 hours the vodka drinker passed out and was sleeping in peace, and i decided to go the center of the city<br />&nbsp;where all the night clubs are, with my first friend. We really walked a lot! I mean, i am sure it was more than 10km this time.<br />&nbsp;We were a little bit uncomfortable because everywhere was overcrowded and <br />&nbsp;some drunk bastards broke beer bootles on the ground and were yelling.<br />Finally we have choosen a good club danced a lot till 4:00.<br />Music and dancing and looking at the disco ball was awesome :) Than we decided to return back home because we have exhausted ourselves<br />&nbsp;too much. Over 10km walking and 3-4 hours of dancing! LSD might be ultimate fat burner! <br />&nbsp;I had still visuals at 4:00 but not much euphoria and passion left to stay awake and enjoy it. <br />So i took 1mg clonozepam this time instead of 2mg and it worked like a charm. I am awake now, no side effects or tiredness.<br />Clean drug, clean trip, big thanks LucyDrop.<br />I hope he/she will solve all the recent issues with the weak batch and angry customers and everyone will be happy again.<br />Peace guys, have a nice weekend! ;)<br /><br />

				Congrats, sounds like you had a couple of fun trips.&nbsp; And, man you got some balls to order from the SR to the Middle East.&nbsp; lol.<br /><br />To any newbs reading this, there is a lot of speculation that LucyDrop may be a scammer.&nbsp; It is highly advised not to order from him until the situation gets cleared up.&nbsp; And definitely DO NOT FE.<br /><br />Read more here:<br />http://weirderweb.com/2013/02/28/is-lucydrop-the-latest-silk-road-scammer-65000-in-late-lsd-orders-says-yes/<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126332.0<br /><br />and various threads in the Rumor Mill forum

				Interesting to hear, hopefully more people start receiving as well. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a handful receive then the rest don&#039;t, but only time can tell

				yeah, i think lucydrop is bad news now. I FE&#039;d on a 10 strip because he was top 1%. it wasnt a huge financial loss but now i&#039;m hesitant to trust any lsd vendors from canada.

				Ya, I&#039;m in the same boat.&nbsp; FE&#039;d, since it was my first transaction.&nbsp; Oh well, it was only $70<br /><br />I did receive my order from Tessallated (Canadian vendor) in a week.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be able to try it anytime soon.&nbsp; But, the reviews that are coming in say it is great.

				Yeah his review thread is full of unsatisfied people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seems his stuff was good, but now it&#039;s not.&nbsp; It&#039;s SO easy to ruin LSD though, I am hoping whatever mistake was made in handling or manufacturing will be fixed.
