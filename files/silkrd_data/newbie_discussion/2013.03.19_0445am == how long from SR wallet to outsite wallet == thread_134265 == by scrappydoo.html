				but it&#039;s been 3 hours.. does it take longer widthdrawing funds from SR to an outside wallet because it tumbles the coins internally here first?<br />also, when i put my outside wallet btc address into blockchain it is not showing any conformations or even the transactions.. something is wrong. but it said &quot;payment sent&quot; when i used the &quot;withdraw&quot; feature on SR. Oh man did I lose my bitcoins into thin air?! :(<br /><br />

				12hrs?! have you seen that happen? how could it possibly take 12 hours. also, the fact that its not showing up on blockchain scares me. is that because of SR&#039;s internal tumbling? any mod wanna chime in?

				My transfers in have taken up to 24 hours. Transfers out probably have a similar process so until 24 hours I wouldn&#039;t worry.<br /><br />Why so worried about $50?
