				I don&#039;t have fifty posts yet, but wanted to update on an order from this new vendor, STEVEPHARMA.&nbsp; First, I missed out on samples by not getting back to my computer till the next day, then he sent me some anyway.&nbsp; Shipping is super fast, two days from ordering to get to midwest.&nbsp; Stealth could be improved upon IMO, I dont like loose product in just a letter.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how many are in a sample, but getting that amount for a sample shows me the vendor is serious about doing repeat business for years to come. Product is exactly as described, Roche outsourced so these come from a subsidiary company(but still have ROCHE imprint, but test for purity is 98.5+/- accurate for med to binder ratio.&nbsp; Vendor is extremely friendly and seems will be a good asset to the SR community.&nbsp; I have only sampled the Valium (one to start), and I feel great!&nbsp; I will be back for more, just hoping they upgrade the stealth a little, although I may be paranoid and it not be necessary.<br /><br />Final Review:<br />Initial Communication-5<br />Product-6(out of five, they&#039;re good)<br />Shipping-2 days(fastest ever for me)<br />Cust. Service after purchase-10/5 He responds very quickly afterwards to discuss any questions.<br />Overall-4.99 out of 5. Only concern was stealth, but again, I&#039;m always paranoid.<br /><br />Limitless Horizon - I&#039;m not an addict I&#039;m just a veteran at it.

				Literally only complaint on my part was stealth and he agreed to improve on it. Otherwise extremely fast shipping, quick communication literally within minutes at times, and a GENEROUS sample. Not to mention some of the best xanax I&#039;ve had in a long while. All in all a good vendor that I&#039;ll definitely be ordering all my benzo&#039;s from from now on.<br /><br />Definitely a trustworthy vendor
