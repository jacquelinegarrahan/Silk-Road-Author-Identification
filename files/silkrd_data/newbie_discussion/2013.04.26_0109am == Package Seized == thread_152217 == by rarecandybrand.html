				well my first ever order on here got seized today and there is still one in transit. I don&#039;t know what to do at this point. Can&#039;t cancel the 2nd package and I feel like now my mail is going to be flagged. The address is got sent to isnt my home address obviously but should I worry about cleaning house at home in case people start knocking on my door or am I overthinking this? Also, IF and when the second envelope arrives in the mail what should I do? its not like I can refuse it because its an envelope and I dont have to sign for it in the first place, it just gets left in the mailbox. Thanks for any and all your help. Kinda freaking out but trying not to

I would make a deal with LE.. Don&#039;t tell them a fucking word but promise that if you&#039;re provided a lawyer and a paper saying they will not prosecute you for anything. you will tell them &quot;everything you know including who sent you the package&quot;.... Wait until you have a piece of paper signed saying they are not going to prosecute then go ahead and show them around silk road LOL .... &quot;Yes sir, I bought my *illegal substance* from UndergroundWeedSmoker420BongHead on Silk Road&quot; then continue &quot;tell them everything you know&quot;<br /><br />Thats another great thing about this website. You can totally sell your vender out and tell everything there is to tell and it will only leave LE with more questions than answers.&nbsp; Just make sure you get alawyer to read overr the papers you sign and don&#039;t say a word till you are promised freedom in exchange for &quot;everything I know&quot; LOL<br /><br />

				Hmm, I was always under the assumption that as long as you kept the obvious drugs in small amounts (If it&#039;s MDMA, just order single grams for personal use), and the only big orders you do are on practically un-fucking-detectable drugs (Blotter drugs, 2C/LSD bla bla), then you should never get anythin seized, international or otherwise.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read tonnes of people saying that they have even been using their real fucking name and real address, and have had hundreds of orders sent to them with no problem EVER.<br /><br />You need to get a better vendor who knows how to stealth-pack. <br /><br />Also, how big of an order was it to get seized? Goddamn. And are you sure it was actually seized and it&#039;s not just taking a long time? Did you get a love letter?

I would make a deal with LE.. Don&#039;t tell them a fucking word but promise that if you&#039;re provided a lawyer and a paper saying they will not prosecute you for anything. you will tell them &quot;everything you know including who sent you the package&quot;.... Wait until you have a piece of paper signed saying they are not going to prosecute then go ahead and show them around silk road LOL .... &quot;Yes sir, I bought my *illegal substance* from UndergroundWeedSmoker420BongHead on Silk Road&quot; then continue &quot;tell them everything you know&quot;<br /><br />Thats another great thing about this website. You can totally sell your vender out and tell everything there is to tell and it will only leave LE with more questions than answers.&nbsp; Just make sure you get alawyer to read overr the papers you sign and don&#039;t say a word till you are promised freedom in exchange for &quot;everything I know&quot; LOL<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />idk how i feel about this
