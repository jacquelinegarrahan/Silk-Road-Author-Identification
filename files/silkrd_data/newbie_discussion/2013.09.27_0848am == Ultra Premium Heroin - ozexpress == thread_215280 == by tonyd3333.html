				I am a firm believer that variety is the spice of life, so I&#039;ve taken advantage of the various vendors on SR to sample this and that and that and this... I like to dabble in a few different flavors, sometimes uppers, sometimes downers, and sometimes (though very rarely) I like the psychedelics. <br /><br />As I&#039;m sure most heroin buyers have noticed, there&#039;s one vendor from Australia, ozexpress, that offers dope from the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in Southeast Asia. The prices are significantly higher than your average gear, but when I read through the reviews. it was clear that there is a reason for that. I knew I had to try this vendor when I had the bitcoins to do so. <br /><br />I put in an order to coincide with a work trip, so I could enjoy it away from family and friends and devote my time to this endeavor and experience it without distraction. <br /><br />If you are the type of user who likes to experience the best of the best, I would highly recommend doing the same. I feel like the dope I&#039;ve used in the past was like playing asteroids on an Atari, and this stuff is like playing on the holodeck in Star Trek TNG. Whenever you want to treat yourself to something special, and you&#039;ve got the money to do it, give this stuff try. <br /><br />One warning though (aside from being careful in the amount you do, it&#039;s very strong and could easily cause an OD)... MAKE SURE YOU ORDER WITH TIME TO SPARE FOR SHIPPING. I haven&#039;t been a frequent user for over a year, I never use long enough to get sick if I run out. I only use periodically these days, and then take a break so as not find myself in that situation. It took two weeks from the time I ordered until it arrived. Stealth was amazing, though, and again... there&#039;s no better product out there. I&#039;ve tried enough dope to know that it doesn&#039;t get any better than this, and if you find any that is... Well, sir, please PM me because I would be much obliged to partake. <br /><br />Has anybody else have an experience with this vendor that they&#039;d like to share, I&#039;d love to hear it.

				I&#039;ve been buying from Ozexpress for about a year and won&#039;t use anyone else. The quality of his services is reason enough for my loyalty: reliable, prompt and good communication which is always appreciated. Generally, I place my order Monday day or night; within hours he has processed and sent the order, which will most likely arrive Friday or if I&#039;m lucky, Thurs. Only on a few rare occasions has it arrived the following Monday or so, and I suspect that has to do with Aus Post.<br /><br />The quality....for the most part is great. Go easy on this stuff, folks! It&#039;s always good, often times GREAT. My most recent order is of beautiful strength and quality. It&#039;s not taking much at all to get me very high.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not going to sit here and say exact numbers on what gets me high because everybody&#039;s different and doing so is dangerous.&nbsp; I am a near-daily opiate user (snorting), of av. weight FYI.<br /><br /><br />Highly recommended, people please don&#039;t mess Ozexpress around because we want him on the road for as long as possible! <br /><br />

His service, professionalism, and communication are all 2nd to none, plus he&#039;s a top bloke.<br /><br />He can be found on sheep, under same name, but he doesn&#039;t have a sellers account.<br /><br />You can message him their, just make sure to use PGP.<br /><br />
