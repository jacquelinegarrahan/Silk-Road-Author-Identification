				Hello to all the great Freedom Fighter who visit the Silk Road! I have been a buyer here for almost 2 years and I finally took the plunge and got my vendor&#039;s account. Here is the link to my page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3d54779788<br /><br />I still have some things to do before I send out some free samples. I&#039;m in the process of sourcing product. My specialty is customer service and product quality. I will have different kinds of product at different times. I&#039;ll always be using PGP and I&#039;ll always be using some kind of sealed packaging for products that need to be sealed. I&#039;ll never keep any sensitive data. It&#039;ll be destroyed and done away with immediately after I print it out for the packaging and I&#039;ll always be using the latest technology in stealth.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be back after I get some more details worked out. For now I&#039;ll only be shipping with in the USA but as time moves on I&#039;ll be adding international.

				High Quality products depending on the demand in the market place. I&#039;m thinking about vending some 2 mg xanax bars to begin with and I&#039;ll be sending out some in the first sample run.

				The reliable reviewers list exists for vendors who want to make sure they will get a review for their product, always good to select some of your samplers from there.
