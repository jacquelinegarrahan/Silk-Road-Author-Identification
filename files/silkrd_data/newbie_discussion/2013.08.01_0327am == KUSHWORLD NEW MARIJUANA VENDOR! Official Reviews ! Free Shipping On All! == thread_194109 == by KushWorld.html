KW also gave me updates on when things were leaving and they provided me with everything i needed and asked for as they are a newer vendor to the Road and each and every time KushWorld came thru with what i asked of them very pleased with comms and extremely , extremely friendly vendor! Def. if you have any concerns or questions or you just want to inquire about strain quality&nbsp; PM the vendor he is very nice and will respond in little to no time at all and will give you much help while looking around at his selection.<br /><br />Speed: 5/5 The speed is exactly laid out in vendors profile it was very fast lightening speed and the order spent little to no time in processing KW had everything out and marked well within his 48hr processing time line and arrived a couple days later , especially with a new vendor getting slammed with a bunch of sample orders and whatnot KW came thru and managed all of that and i received my order in little to no time at all. I think it takes longer for some people to get coins than it did for me to finalize this transaction , just shows how fast KushWorld really is and im sure with messaging back and forth you could even worth something out with the vendor im telling you this guy aims to please with customer service he truly will take care of you!<br /><br />Product: 5/5 I can only speak for the one sample kind that was given out which looks to be buggati kush im not 100% if that is the batch i received but either way the potency is amongst the best of what the road has to offer. The product was covered in a light yelllowy redish hairs and trichs galore everywhere also the kush packed a powerful fruity aroma that went along with the taste. The nice fruity earthy flavor had my taste buds on fire for more especially as the aroma of the smoke came thru your nose, def. a nice and enjoyable smooth smoke with amazing taste!! The buds were you typical legit kush very dense and packed a very nice potent indica high, and everything was overweight so i was def. pleased with what i seen with the product. I also see KW has probably about another 10 or so strains on hand so at KW there is no shortage of variety and if the other strains are anywhere as good as the buggati they have legit fire HQ products and i will def. be checking out some other strains they offer.<br /><br />Stealth / Shipping: 5/5 Shipping as stated above is lightening fast and if you want amazing HQ product with blazing fast shipping speeds i would check KushWorld out! Stealth was exactly as he states in profile, everything is well packaged and labeled as well as there is ZERO compression at all from vac seal NO SMASHED PRODUCT EVERYTHING CAME IN ITS ORIGINAL BEAUTIFUL SHAPE!!!! To me that can be a bigger factor when a vendor crushes the product but you dont have to worry about that at KushWorld they use several layers of protection so they dont crunch everything down in one shot like some vendors.<br /><br />Overall Transaction Rating: 5/5&nbsp; Overall i was extremely pleased all the way around with KushWorld, i have dealt with several different vendors and have seen countless strains and methods and have encountered so many different vending styles i just wanted to say KushWorld is easily in my favorite vendors category and i know will be back to try some other strains out. But the transaction as a whole was perfect everything from the communication all the way to delivery couldnt have been done any better! I Want to thank KushWorld and i apologize on the delay for the response i was a little caught up on things but i wanted to get this out to share with other travelers to def. take a stop at KushWorld...the list of exotic strains are endless and to go along with the top notch service and HQ products i promise KushWorld will not disappoint you whatsoever!

				Which strain is the most Sativa?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried weed but would like to try a sativa dom.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking to buy a very small qty to start for cheap just to try it.&nbsp; If I like it I&#039;ll probably be more loyal whoever I buy from first I suppose....too many options on SR to change once I find something I like.

				So I ordered the OG Sour Diesel :) :) :) and really have nothing but great things to say about it. Very crystally, long pretty hairs, and very distinct smell. I can say it is the most legit OGSD I have ever seen. I felt I had ordered out of a High Times Magazine. The shipping was very quick (2 Days) and vendor was very responsive to my questions and very nice. I do trust this vendor and will order from again. <br /><br />BTW<br /><br />I do not know if mystery thing is still going on but if it is my guess is Superman OG

				Hey KushWorld how are you doing? From reading what others are saying and from my last 2 purchases from you I would think that you stay on top of your business<br /><br />I&#039;d like for everyone to stand up and give KushWorld a standing ovation because he really goes the extra mile to ensure That I get what I order with in the time frame outlined on his vendor page. I&#039;m pretty happy with the packaging and stealth 5/5<br /><br />I&#039;ve made 2 buys from KW so far and the weight is awesome both times so far. My first order from KW was for an eighth of J1 and it weighed 3.69 on my lil digis. I&#039;ve always loved Jack Herrer ever since first trying it not long ago and when I saw that he had J1 I couldn&#039;t wait to try it and it was really great. Crossing it with Skunk 1&nbsp; made it turn out to be immaculate. I was really happy with it so I decided to try out his Master OG next and I&#039;m glad I did. Wow! <br /><br />I ordered it under his listing to get 8 grams of any strain listed. It&#039;s been such a busy week for me but I think it took 4 or 5 days to get&nbsp; here. It had to go thru a Sunday also and my next order will also because I&#039;m getting ready to order some now. I&#039;m highly impressed with KushWorld&#039;s High Quality reefer. The buds are so dense and contain no un usable materials like seeds or stems. That last 8 gram I got did have a small piece of stem and I chewed on it and finally swallowed it. <br /><br />Thank you KushWorld for all the extra &quot;little things&quot; I know you have to do so we will be happy with what we buy from you. Thanks as well for vending such killer buds here for us. Pretty soon you will notice a new order from me.

				So I&#039;ve bought from many many sellers and had many great experiences so far on SR.<br /><br />I saw the unique strains that Kushworld was offering and decided to place an order, and so far I&#039;m VERY disappointed with my experience. <br /><br />His ad (and this discussion thread) clearly state FREE SHIPPING ON ALL. When I went to place my order I noticed that there was no option for free shipping, so I contacted the seller. He said that he&#039;d changed his policy and it was now only ounces and up. Shipping isn&#039;t that expensive and to me free shipping is a bonus, not a requirement, but it seemed to me that since he didn&#039;t change his listing he should have honored his promise. In any case I didn&#039;t argue. <br /><br />I placed my order on Sunday (paying for shipping too) and it was posted as &quot;In Transit&quot; EARLY on Monday. I didn&#039;t hear anything further so I assumed my stuff was on its way...Then Thursday night he sends me a message telling me that he&#039;s finally sent my package. I thought it was strange so I went back and read the vendor profile, which states that all shipments go out withing 24-48 hours of ordering.<br /><br />I think its important to note that the transaction isn&#039;t completely finished yet, but all I can say at this point is that the stuff better be as good if not better than advertised or I can&#039;t see giving him a very positive final review or using them again. They&#039;ve already broken two promises they&#039;ve made to me...fingers crossed.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You&#039;re right about the shipping delay. I apologize for complaining about that.

				I would be very weary of ordering anything (especially FE) with this vendor for the next bit. He recently listed MP to BTC exchange at a rate of 5% (should have been the first red flag for me). I sent him a message asking if he was online and prepared to do an echange. He informed me that he was. With that I placed the order and sent over a MP in the amount of $278.00. All contact ceased. He has yet to send my BTC or even offer any excuse as to why he has yet to complete my order. <br /><br />If he releases my funds I will glady return here and offer a public apology and admit my mistake. <br /><br /><br />BEWARE OF THE VENDOR KUSHWORLD.<br /><br />I highly believe that he is about to burn his vendor account.

				My experience:<br />I was informed of the shipment being sent out within 24 hours of ordering. It was not the best packaging i have gotten from SR, but there was no scent from the envelope. The amount was .1 over, and the bud was good. It was well trimmed and well dried. Overall I had a very good experience with this vendor. If only he gave samples to returning customers who have birthdays coming up&nbsp; 8). I would def use this vendor again and will.
