				it does sound very interesting. however the fact that googling onion bank does not produce a single result related to it makes me very wary. their site has very little info also, and some of the T&amp;Cs are scary...<br /><br />If you lose your key, or it is stolen, it is not our problem and we will not help you.(its just the way they say it, lol)<br /><br />Dormant Accounts<br />If a user has not logged in to his account within a period of two years, the account will be deemed abandoned and may be closed and all funds retained by Onion Bank.

				I signed up for an account. When you log in with your PGP key it gives you a PGP message to decrypt. In that message you&#039;re given a code to login with. I don&#039;t have any coins to play with atm but an experimental tumble is warranted.

				Damn, that is unfortunate,&nbsp; I liked the idea of my BTC activity staying in onionland. what with the sneaky-sneak and so forth. <br />TAILS w/ no persitance, and memorize SR info, onionbank info, and write down or have PGP on stick or usb?<br /><br />&nbsp;Sorry, the pink panther theme song comes on thinking about that.

				i&#039;m a noob so take this advice with a mountain of salt, but i wouldn&#039;t trust any new banks... or onion wallets for that matter. just seems way to easy to be scammed. it&#039;s not like btc&#039;s are illegal.
