				This is my more thorough review of Warbeast after receiving from him today:<br /><br />It is my pleasure to have &quot;met&quot; Warbeast and to finalize for him.&nbsp; Let me just say I am astounded and blown away by what he offers.&nbsp; His product is nothing like what else is offered on SR.&nbsp; Where do I even start?&nbsp; Even though I have never had grade A pure meth, this is the closest I&#039;ve come and I believe it has little to no cut in it.&nbsp; It is potent as hell.&nbsp; I felt it on the first pipe hit.&nbsp; The second hit I got high, real high.&nbsp; The third, I just started getting wasted.&nbsp; Course had to have a couple more cause it is just such a joy to smoke. Pleasant &quot;no taste&quot; and appears to leave no residue (not sure 2+ hours later I&#039;ve had about 15 hits and the bowl is still going good . . .).&nbsp; Also, about the potency . . . I&#039;ve had other SR meth where I took 30+ hits back to back over the course of a half hour to hour and felt little.&nbsp; With this, I can&#039;t take more than 5 good puffs without getting overwhelmed and &quot;crazy&quot;.&nbsp; Also, started sweatin on just my second puff.&nbsp; As for snortin&#039;, did a 1&quot; x 1/8&quot; line and it burned quite a bit.&nbsp; Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t judge the effect of the line cause I was just too high from smoking.&nbsp; And let me just say, this shit is clean.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know meth could be like this.&nbsp; No sleepiness, no confusion, no headache, no lack of attention/focus, no lack of sex drive (this shit will make ya real horny!).&nbsp; Oh, and how does the man weigh his bags?&nbsp; Fat!!!&nbsp; I ordered 2gs and got 2.5 on arrival.&nbsp; 0.5 was a little shake and lots of little crystals (real crystals, irregular, splinters, and slivers) and a full 2.0 was small shards (up to 0.6 the largest was).&nbsp; Shipping, man Warbeast is quick.&nbsp; Within 45min. of my order at 11pm, he had it in transit.&nbsp; Late tuesday night in transit, had it Friday afternoon for the weekend!&nbsp; How&#039;s that for perfect?!!!&nbsp; The package was plain without a lot of stealth but it appeared quite passable to me.&nbsp; Also, no smell whatsoever, WB does take time and effort to ensure this and I do appreciate it.&nbsp; Overall, and I hate to say this because of possible consequences, shit this quality at this price is a steal.&nbsp; If Warbeast can keep the price down like this and deliver this quality of product over and over again, and in larger quantities as well, the market shall be his.&nbsp; I encourage you all to sample what this fine vendor offers.&nbsp; For me, I have found what I consider the Holy Grail for myself.&nbsp; Thank you so much Beast, you&#039;ve made my day and weekend and found a new loyal customer.&nbsp; Take care Beast, until next time.&nbsp; Take care everyone else and may you find what you are looking for.<br /><br />Turtle
