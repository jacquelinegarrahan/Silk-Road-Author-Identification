				Hey everyone :)<br />Im looking for a regular, go to, domestic cola vendor (US). I have tried PureOrganx, Licentia. Licentia is good but could be better. PureO was either way to strong or something else being sold as. Want an upbeat, talk my face off experience! :) Considering ayeseadee1080, dragoncove or sprayman. Prefer 3.5 listings. Anyone have experience with these 3 mentioned?&nbsp; Will be purchasing combo EZ Test kit as well. Thanks for any thoughts/advice!!<br />Cheers! :)

				Cola??&nbsp; Try a convenience store.<br /><br />If you are into some cocaine, I have read nothing but good things about nod&#039;s product but I have yet to try it, or anything from him as a vendor.&nbsp; Sorry, not terribly helpful, I know.

				I have ordered from ayeseadee1080 twice.&nbsp; His stealth and quality isn&#039;t as good as some of the euro vendors, but his customer service is excellent.&nbsp; You should check the thread on lab-tested samples.&nbsp; For small quantities, I think ordering from Europe is pretty safe if you have a good delivery plan.&nbsp;

				Lol I always call it cola, too. Maybe it&#039;s a regional thing. <br />I&#039;ve only tried one vendor for that so far, blueberry91. I was pleased with it...no hassles, they are friendly, good prices. <br />To me, the product was good, but our standards may differ. I&#039;m used to the incredibly weak, cut-with-meth crap they pass off as coke in my town. Having lived on both coasts and knowing what cola SHOULD be, I gave up on the regional sh*t and came here to SR. <br />I&#039;d be interested in hearing what other folks think about the cola vendors, too. I like to IV once in awhile, so purity is very important to me.

				Thanks everyone for your input! <br />I have decided to try my local street again just to compare....eh...well at least its 1/2 the price...already getting stuffy and a racy heartbeat!! lol<br />I don&#039;t mind paying but within reason. Also after having Pureo&#039;s supposedly 97% and not really enjoying the experience I wondered if I may not like high purity. But as some others have noticed something isnt quite right with his.&nbsp; So I may not have liked it bc it wasnt even C! I wonder if it&#039;s methylone or something else being passed off as cola. However I am NOT an expert!! <br />Cola, C, yay, yo, white, snow, blow, so many names!! :)<br />Considering washing it....idk. Well I am rambling so somethings working!! <br /><br />Happy Friday! Have a fkn awesome weekend everyone!! :D

				I&#039;ve had good luck with 10toes, bcpltd, and Hank Trill. <br />Hank&#039;s stuff is a little cheaper priced (like $280 a ball?) but is still pretty good. Clean for sure, and still almost as good as the other two.

I thought it was great at first, first few lines, but, by the end of the night my opinion of it reversed.<br />I just today got an order from Bungee and, tewll ya what, if you don&#039;t mind the wait and don&#039;t mind ordering from overseas, that stuff straight up rocks. It&#039;s about the best C your gonna get yer hands on. I wrote a review over in the rumor mill. Beautiful beautiful product, some people can go years and never sample quality like that. Not to dis any of the top US vendors, just, this stuff is a step above. Lab tested at 87% out of a 89% (which is the highest possible ), I know, sounds weird but over in the lab test thread it is explained. It doesn&#039;t meAn 89% is the highest possible purity, just that with the chemical testing process thats the highest result you will get, so, 89% is effectively the equivalent to a true 100%.&nbsp; &nbsp; :o&nbsp; I know, weird, but, bottum line, the 87% result is in reality 97.75% purity. 87/89 x 100 = purity. Again, this is explained a little better in the other thread. I&#039;ve had C this good once and it was around 1984 if I remember right. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to the lab test thread:...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s the review I wrote for Bungee&#039;s C&nbsp; :<br />Woo Fucking Hoo<br />I got my G from Bungree today, and&nbsp; I gotta say, this is some world class cocaine!!!<br />Product/Packaging/Communications.......10/9/10<br /><br />Check this one off of my bucket list.......sample pure cocaine, or as pure as you can get it pretty much.<br /><br />Product- This stuff came as all powder , as expected from previous reviews. The taste is clean, not too bitter and it goes up the nose as smooth as a super models ass. Nice numbing, not so intense that you know it&#039;s just a cut, a numbing agent. The high is superb. It creeps up on ya and it&#039;s just perfect. No paranoia, no jitters , just a strong euphoria . I can&#039;t say enough about this C. I&#039;ve tried some of the best on the Road and this , hands down beats em all. Worth the wait, which was 14 days to the east coast USA. Size wise, I haven&#039;t got a scale but compared to some other G&#039;s I&#039;ve got it LOOKS huge. This stuff is a pleasure to sniff and about as close to perfect ads you can get.<br /><br />Packaging - 9 just because of the melted bag mentioned by others. I expected it however and was careful opening , I lost nothing but can see how if I wasn&#039;t expecting it I might have lost a little.<br /><br />Comms - There wasn&#039;t much need of communication but from the moment I ordered Bungee kept me informed.<br /><br />To sum it all up, Bungee&#039;s C is NOT hype. This is world class cocaine ladies and gentlemen.......<br />I did some C back in the 80&#039;s that I&#039;ve never forgot, thats how good it was. Since then, it&#039;s been the benchmark to which I&#039;ve compared all C since, been close a few times but never this close. In fact , I think Bungee&#039;s product is just as good, if not a little better.... My search is over&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Thanks Bungee!!!<br /><br />I also received an order of pure from Pablospuro today, ya, good day . I&#039;ll hjavta wait to sample that , will review later..<br /><br /><br />UPDATE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, that report was based on one small line. Thats all it takes, a bump. Anyway, that was about an hour n a half ago and thye comedown is almost non existant. No shitty feeling, no fiending, no nothing . This stuff is all they say it is.

				As far as reasonably priced domestic vendors, I&#039;ve had good luck with bcpltd. He sells in .10 increments for less than $10 each so ya just order 10 if ya want a gram. It&#039;s cool if you have a few bitcoins hanging around , ya can order like $20 bucks worth , or whatever $$ worth and his stuff is pretty good.&nbsp; So, at least for the Road, his prices are cheap.....$100ish/G . <br /><br />

				Have had Nod, DubGx2, DrWhite, Sukey&#039;s Ultra-Clean, and Bungee54&#039;s Peruvian recently. <br /><br />For domestic, DrWhite is best, although Nod and DubGx2 aren&#039;t bad. DrWhite doesn&#039;t do a lot of marketing, which in a way I find pretty cool. He&#039;s basically like, &quot;this is excellent quality - take it or leave it&quot; - and I think most of the US users have already been gravitating towards him because they&#039;re finding this out for themselves. Hope he&#039;s able to dig up another block of &quot;excellent quality&quot; from his bag. <br /><br />If you&#039;re willing to wait for int&#039;l, Sukey&#039;s is very good but Bungee&#039;s Peruvian is amazing. As in actual 98% pure cocaine :) (check the testing thread for the conversion - with 89% being the top possible due to the conversion method to a base to do the test, 87% is actually about 98% pure). Some of the other reviews of this batch seem over the top, but it really is that good. DrWhite&#039;s is close, but seems to have a very small amount of inactive cut that makes my nose a little stuffy - doesn&#039;t really bother me, but there really is nothing like the feeling of a line of truly pure coke for those of us that treat the search for 100% pristine quality coke as the Quest For the (Un)Holy Grail. Sukey&#039;s UC may turn out to be 98% pure too - but there is a slight but noticeable difference to me (after trying each several times on different days) where I found Sukey&#039;s just as butter-smooth but less euphoric than Bungee&#039;s. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to put down the quality of any of the vendors listed - they all have very high-quality product and have been great to deal with. This is just my personal opinion of rankings. While my nose is a testing ground, it&#039;s not a laboratory, and someone else could rank the same stuff completely opposite. <br /><br />Keep in mind when comparing vendors that the vendors themselves are often at the mercy of their own suppliers. Bungee is obviously (and justifiably) very pleased with their current Peruvian source and will likely maintain it as long as possible, but you should be looking at the reviews (and the vendor&#039;s own statements) about THE CURRENT particular batch, not the awesome one from last Christmas or whenever. <br /><br />Lastly, I will say that while some vendors may charge wildly differing prices for similar quality, if you want really great coke you can&#039;t also expect it to be cheap. If a vendor has access to pure, they know they can charge top dollar - why wouldn&#039;t they? So you can get great, and you can get cheap, but I doubt you&#039;ll find great AND cheap on SR. While possible, I take claims of &quot;I&#039;m now offering 100% pure C at a much lower price than others&quot; with a grain of salt. Could be a fresh new vendor trying to break in - more likely you&#039;re just getting what you pay for. <br /><br />Sorry for the long post, hope this helps :)<br /><br />P.S. the lab that PineappleLove and Suidone use is in Europe - Nod doesn&#039;t ship there so I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s been tested in the lab (nor has any other US vendor that won&#039;t ship to Europe). While the EZTest for cuts pretty much sucks, I did an EZtest for purity and one for cuts myself on all of the above and none showed levamisole and all showed high purity.<br />

				One recommendation I would make:&nbsp; be sure to purchase a sample size before you order an eighth and then make sure with your vendor that the sample is the same as what you will be buying in a subsequent order.&nbsp; I have found reviews here often very unreliable (erring on the overly positive rather than vice-versa).&nbsp; Maybe I just got bad batches, but I ordered 1/2 gram amounts from two prominent and well recommended vendors and I could not believe I had the same stuff which had received such glowing reviews.&nbsp; Perhaps I have a high standard;&nbsp; I did cocaine mostly in the 1970&#039;s and 80&#039;s when I am sure coke was of better quality generally than it is today.&nbsp; But the stuff I bought here hardly even caused any numbing - what kind of coke is that?.&nbsp; It did have a high to it which was vaguely pleasant but a far cry from the cocaine I was familiar with from years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;I put an order in for coke from a new vendor, &quot;Studio54&quot;, which has been extremely well reviewed by a few people.&nbsp; I expect it to arrive on Monday.&nbsp; I&#039;ll review it here.&nbsp;

				I want to add that Bungee and Sukey both have EXCELLENT stealth packaging.&nbsp; I was very nervous about ordering international to the US, but I think their packages are better than any domestic that I&#039;ve seen (other than perhaps BCPLTD, though he has a little Levamisol in his).<br /><br />

I just wanted to add that the cocaine that I sell on here is what I use to make the crack. It is of very high quality and free from superbuff. Please read up on how harmful levamisole is because it is found in 85-90% of the cocaine out there these days. You can recognize it your crack if it is glittery when you hold it up to the light. It also gives crack a &quot;hairy&quot; taste. This buff is very harmful for you so please consume carefully.

				MariosGramShoppe is easily the best blow dealer, domestic or international...I&#039;ve ordered a couple of balls from him and every time, the quality seems to get better, plus his prices are unbeatable...with free priority shipping and a 8-ball for $250, I&#039;d say you can&#039;t go wrong with MGS because it&#039;s the best coke I&#039;ve gotten from SR (and I&#039;ve ordered from a long list of vendors) and best of all, he gives it to you straight and is nothing but the real deal

				Having just received my first order of C from Nod, I feel compelled to let others know my reaction, in case they&#039;re wondering which vendor to choose for blow.<br /><br />Before ordering, I read the profiles of quite a few vendors. Two things about Nod stood out among the others. 1) He was very forthright in declaring the highest quality of his product without conveying a sense of desperation, such as you&#039;d find with a car salesman. He quietly, eloquently says he offers the best on SR, along with first rate shipping and shipping success. 2) He convincingly charges premium prices which are consistent with his claims.&nbsp; In other words, he has the best, and if you want the best, along with outstanding customer service, you will have to pay for it.&nbsp; Yet there&#039;s never a sense of arrogance to his tone, just matter-of-fact confidence.<br /><br />Having initially sampled his product just 2 days ago, I knew immediately this was - to quote the old Coca-Cola slogan - &quot;The Real Thing.&quot;&nbsp; Smooth on the uptake and a mellow buzz, you only have to do small lines to get the full effect.&nbsp; But it&#039;s the finest effect I&#039;ve ever experienced.&nbsp; Though I have not sampled that of any other vendor here, Nod&#039;s might just be the best on SR, as he claims.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to imagine anything topping this.<br /><br />Really exceptional, highly recommended!<br /><br />clingbo54&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				<br />Hi Captain,<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a great idea to put up some discount paid samples.&nbsp; I&#039;ve often been disappointed with the coke I&#039;ve bought on SR so that I&#039;m reluctant to purchase a full gram without trying it in advance.&nbsp; I know you may not have the time to sell samples always, but since you&#039;re just starting out your offer will permit many more people to get acquainted with the quality of your offerings than would be possible if you only sold full grams and up.&nbsp; I also like the opportunity we&#039;ll have to purchase a variety of different types of cocaine (from different locales) over time.&nbsp; And good quality for great prices, of course!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be looking out for your listings.&nbsp; Orpheus
