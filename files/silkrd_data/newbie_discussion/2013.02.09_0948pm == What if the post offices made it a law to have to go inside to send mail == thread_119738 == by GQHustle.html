				Because SR is probably helping fill a lot of more mailboxes, probably then ever before, with drugs, in a crazy world where the government made it a rule to have to walk inside and be filmed (of course this won&#039;t probably ever happen),&nbsp; but do you think that would greatly affect a vendors sense of anonymity.

				Who knows.&nbsp; Everything I&#039;ve ever gotten from anyone on SR was packaged so intelligently that no one could have possibly suspected drugs.&nbsp; Ebay would more likely come to mind than SR.&nbsp;

				post offices barely have enough money to carry on the service they currently provide, let alone getting huge investment for creating the infrastructure and extra staff it would need for every single item of mail to manually input in the system
