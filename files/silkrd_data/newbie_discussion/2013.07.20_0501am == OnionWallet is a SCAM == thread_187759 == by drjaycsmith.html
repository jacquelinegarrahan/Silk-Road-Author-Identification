				*** IMPORTANT UPDATE ***<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Do not use OnionWallet (http://ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion/)--it is a SCAM. I transferred a small amount of money in there and it was immediately stolen. The entire website, as legit as it looks, is bogus. After the theft occurred, I did some research and found out that this has happened to a lot of people.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;*** OnionWallet is a SCAM ***

I wish that I had done some research first. I&#039;ve been experimenting with different sites and various methods of obtaining bitcoins for the last couple of days--I&#039;m not sure how I came across OnionWallet--but it simply never occurred to me that the whole thing could be an elaborate setup. I&#039;ve never been scammed up until now, so I blame my complacency.

Basically, I&#039;ve been experimenting for the last two days with different sites, services, exchanges, and methods of obtaining bitcoins. I should have been more careful and done my homework on OnionWallet. Since I was only tinkering, the amount I lost was insignificant. What can I say? I&#039;ve never been scammed before. I was careless.

				*** Avoid OnionWallet--it is a SCAM ***<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Looking to buy &amp; sell bitcoins? There&#039;s lots of options.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://bitinstant.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins, lots of options including MoneyGram. Fund Mt. Gox &amp; other exchanges.<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; http://tradebitcoin.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Link your bank account and buy bitcoins online. Instant transfers after verification.<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://www.nanaimogold.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Similar to BitInstant. Use MoneyGram &amp; Western Union to fund account.<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://virwox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet. Lots of options for funding account (buying BTC).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;No matter what you do, you lose some or all of your anonymity when buying coins; therefore, you should &quot;launder&quot; them.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Here are some sites to route your coins through before depositing them at Silk Road:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://mtgox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; https://easywallet.org/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet<br />&nbsp;--&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinfog.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Launders bitcoins.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;BitInstant, with or without Mt. Gox, is a breeze. Just send a MoneyGram from Wal-Mart or another retailer. You can also link your bank account. Unfortunately, the site is temporarily down as they make some improvements.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;https://localbitcoins.com/ is perhaps the easiest method for obtaining bitcoins. Find someone near you, meet them, pay cash for BTC. I bought some yesterday and it was fast and hassle-free.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, I suggest sending them through Bitcoin Fog and then to BlockChain and EasyWallet; from there, send them to Silk Road. Also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address for every transaction. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance? Recently, an SR vendor was busted and had his coins confiscated because authorities were able to trace his transactions.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;--Dr. Jay

				So the site called OnionWallet did the same thing as TorWallet? Shocking.
