				i guess i did the math wrong. if anyone wants to front me $10 id be glad to pay you back 3x that or hook you up with free phentermine so i can pay my source fee. This is a first come first serve offer. obviously i wont scam for $10 when the fee is $500 id have to be an idiott. i will also have other supplies those are just in stock as we speak. I will be traveling the nexgt 24 hrs if i dont respond right away but after that i will be around for good. feedback will be appreciated. also ,gonna have to post whore this to get my count up

				oh, I have plenty more than $10. I was just trying to save the hassel of going and using one of the many methods of getting it funded, having the program not work right, haveing to re install it, having SR nto work, having my email not work etc etc. that has been my day today. yes im trying to cut corners on this aspect but never on ones safety. if i have to go load more money i will i just havea 22hr drive to do in the am so i was trying to get it settled tonight if possible. no big deal regardless. <br /><br />ill even send out some fronts when im up and running, you being one if you like anything i have as i see you help others on here all the time with questions. ill post up when were operational.

				hahaha lmao. im not laughing at people in financial situations but please make sure you have 3x the amount of money you might ever need just incase. I learned this onetime when a mexican sold to my driver in TJ then sold the car out to border patrol and I was left to cover all the pending orders, the lost car, and his legal expenses and family for the time being. Ill be vague but always have rainy day money and trust no one in TJ lol
