				ok so i am super paranoid and have never ordered befor been lurking for about 2 months and i finally worked up the courage to place a order i wont say what vendor till after i have received and tested but since i cant find acid anywhere else i figured i should give it a go but i tell you ever since the bitcoins turned up in my wallet i have had epic butterflies not so much bad vibes just so much anticipation i havent tripped in 5 yrs not through lack of trying just cant find it. planning on taking a mate on his first trip and i think i want it to all be good for him more than myself he has never had luck with finding good drugs for instance every time he has got pills never have they had any mdma or mda in them only crap and i feel for him because when i used to take them years ago it was easy for me to find good ones and he has heard all my wild stories of weekends fueled by these thing. so for my mate who i only get to see once a year if i am lucky i am stocking up on a few things this is my first try at getting anything on SR so fingers crossed it should be here by the end of the week. so i am just going to come here to vent and get my posts to 50+ as i wait for my delivery&nbsp;

				You sound just like I did...Everything went smooth with my first 5 orders though, hoping it stays that way, as I&#039;m upping the amounts next time around...As long as you&#039;ve done your research you&#039;ll be fine...<br /><br />You&#039;ll only get more nervous the more people you tell...Just don&#039;t say a word about it, until you get it in your hands, then NEVER tell anyone where the stuff came from...You really don&#039;t want people knowing what&#039;s being dropped in your mailbox.<br /><br />Good luck with your first purchases! Make sure to come back and post reviews for us!

				so i got all calm after a few pipes chilled out watched the idiot box with the household then i checked my order and shit got real again now marked as in transit. i almost feel like i did the first time i got mdma befor i actually had it in my hand i was so nervous not as bad now but here i was thinking i was over feeling like that years ago i just hope all this anticipation is worth it. and if this all works i can guarantee that my mate will become a member and try out the SR. i think a few more pipes are in order to calm me down a little more&nbsp;

				so i had a sleep and woke up feeling awesome no paranoia just calm and i am going to try to figure out how to make everything more secure on my end so today i am going to try and figure out how to use tails os and pgp my mate who is 2000km away is going to help me learn how to use pgp because i think regardless on how my first buy goes i will try again and dont want LEO knocking yesterday reminded me about security i forgot to close my torrent client and was seeding for 2 days and recieved email warnings from my isp about suspension of service if i continue to torrent copyrighted material so now i also need to figure out how to hide my torrents i have read i can hire servers to run these things but thats all too complicated for me oh well i guess i better read more

				I had loads of successful orders from another site to Australia, recently did a couple from Silk road. First one of 2.5 ket from england which came here no problem. But my other two orders of 5 gr phet and 5 gr mdma dont seem to make it. Be aware of ordering large quantities. My mate said that if the weight is veryh high they manually check letters. Although i doubt if 3 grams can make a difference. He said up to two no problems. But he is no expert whats however.

				congrats man! i remember when i first heard of this site, and for months thought, &quot;God, i wish how i knew how to use that site!&quot;, then within a month, I had followed tutrrials for setting up TOR and PGP, and I was ready to go. I was exactly the same as you - was so excited with anticipation, yet at the same time scared of officially putting in an order.<br /><br />I will admit that I stupidly got over excited and put in about 4 orders in one go, and didnt do any research as to which countries were safe to order from (ie. not flagged), however, they all managed to come through.<br /><br />Its funny how you go from a few weeks of complete paranoia, and then when you see that package in the mail! oh my, its like you&#039;ve won the grand final! best feeling.<br /><br />As you put in more orders, the anxiety lessens, but that feeling when you find a nice package in the mail never loses its value.<br /><br />But on saying that, don&#039;t get carried away and think that its all too easy and start ordering multiple bulk packages at once!<br /><br />happy ordering, and always play it safe, bro!
