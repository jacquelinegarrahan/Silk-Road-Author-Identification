				Hi, fellow SR members. The most LSD I have tried is 360ug. Within 30 minutes my mind had made up It was gonna be a &quot;bad trip&quot;(bad set and setting). Anyway, I spent a good 2 hours in complete anxiety and terror. I was completely terrified of my kitten lol! After this, things settled down a bit when I put on this colored disco ball thing. It was intense, but I still learned from the experience. Anyway, I had a question for anyone who has bought from multiple LSD vendors. I was wondering, in your opinion, who has the best, cleanest LSD for the price?

				Dude, keep some benzos on hand. Clonazepam is a great reset button for LSD. If you start bad tripping take 1-2 mg of it and you will come right down. I dunno who has the best LSD, but I have seen some red microdots that I would love to get my hands on.

				I took a Diazepam and it didn&#039;t do shit.&nbsp; Then again I do have sort of a high tolerance and I need like four Diazepam to really feel them.&nbsp; It was the worst terror I have ever felt from any psychedelic which is weird.&nbsp; I had taken 120 ug and 240 ug before.&nbsp; I believe it was just bad set and setting I was stressed about school and it was late at night

				Ya a bet setting would do it. I am an older guy, 40ish and have taken a lot of LSD in my teen years, over 3000 hits in my life. I haven&#039;t really had a &quot;bad&quot; trip though I have experienced anxiousness. Usually what I do when I start feeling anxious is put on a movie or some music and get into that. The funny thing is that I usually only feel anxious like that when I smoke weed with the acid. I found out accidentally about the clonazepam resetting the acid. I was on a good trip and took a 2mg pill and within minutes I was done tripping. I chalked it up to bad acid, but then I did the same thing again a few weeks later. Was up and tripping, took a 2mg and boom was done. Finally put 2 and 2 together and decided it was the clonazepam. I looked it up online and it seems other people have found the same, taking benzos while tripping will reset it. Your high tolerance to the valium is probably why it didn&#039;t work, you just needed to take more. I find clonazepam to be the best benzo anyway, it is really powerful.

				Wow, that is interesting.&nbsp; I may order some Clonazepam for bad trips.&nbsp; Diazepam takes 30 min to kick in fully so it is not very good.&nbsp; I agree that I don&#039;t really have bad trips visual wise, just very bad anxiety. LSD doesn&#039;t really give me too many visuals anyway.&nbsp; It just leaves me thinking weird, with crazy emotions, and divine head space (kinda like shrooms except for me shrooms is more of a body high).&nbsp; Benzos for me don&#039;t kill any visuals, they just get rid of the anxiety that is all in my head.

				set and setting are the two biggest factors that determine your trip. <br /><br />dose and product quality do add some aspects, but mostly determine trip&#039;s depth.<br /><br />benzos are indeed useful for ejecting from a bad trip, but this should not be taken lightly as bad trips happen for a reason and typically one needs to work through that material to get some great insights for personal development. Many a psychonaut would say that their &quot;bad&quot; trips (or bad parts of their trips) were actually their best ones in terms of personal growth. I certainly would.<br /><br />LSD does not cause bad trips, you do. Ejecting from it is like trying to run from yourself.<br /><br />When you done with your 50 come over here - all questions LSD have been in discussion there for many months already: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0;topicseen<br /><br />By the way, doses are often very personal thing - some people have hard time imagining ever going over 200ug, some people find that their entry dose.<br /><br />Be safe and happy,<br />IM

				For the trip to stop how much Clonazepam do you take? Just one 2mg pill? <br /><br />I might want to order some just in case I ever need it for an emergency or a super long trip that I want to end so I can catch some sleep .<br /><br />I wonder if it works with other stuff like 2cb and so on?

				Good tip on keeping benzos around to fight anxiety, the relaxing effect can rescue the whole trip. Diazepam is too slow and long lasting I think, I would suggest alprazolam. It kicks in is minutes and only lasts an hour or so.<br /><br />We are always happy to deal with new users.

				I don&#039;t know much about Clonazepam to be honest... I know Diazepam is very safe with alcohol.&nbsp; I take Diazepam only because I am scared I will get addicted to the Benzos with the shorter half-life.&nbsp; I feel like Diazepam has little to no withdrawals... I don&#039;t know... maybe I just don&#039;t take them often enough to experience withdrawals.&nbsp; Diazepam works great for me for long days though.&nbsp; It keeps me anxiety free for about 4-7 hours.

He is also just a great vendor to work with, very helpful with great communication.<br /><br />Tess&#039;s stuff is also clean and I can safely say that one hit of Tess&#039;s WoW is by far the strongest trip I&#039;ve ever had from a single hit. There is so much love and positive vibration that I feel from it too, beautiful stuff.<br /><br />Both vendors are excellent and their products are as well. I would recommend trying them both.

				In my opinion the best would be Clonazepam like people said before.&nbsp; Clonazepam has the sedating effects like Diazepam I believe, but it is much faster acting.&nbsp; Has anyone ever tried Lorazepam for a bad trip?&nbsp; I tried it once while not tripping and it seemed to hit me pretty fast and had me very sedated like Diazepam.

I will update my original post so that I don&#039;t have misinformation up here!
