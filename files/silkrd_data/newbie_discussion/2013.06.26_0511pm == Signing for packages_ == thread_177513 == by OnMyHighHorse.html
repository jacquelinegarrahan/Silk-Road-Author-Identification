				New buyer here and after doing my research I came away with the impression that you should NEVER sign off for a package. After browsing around a bit though it appears some vendors techniques require signature? I&#039;m just curious if this is a complete no-no or if it&#039;s alright under certain circumstances...after all, safety IS key :).

				It&#039;s all about adequate stealth. Nobody is setting up a buyer, if somebody saw drugs or suspected them you probably wouldn&#039;t be getting your package at all.

				Only you can decide if you&#039;re prepared to sign for a parcel. It&#039;s possible for the postal service to screw up and require a signature when one shouldn&#039;t be necessary. If the package has made it all the way to it&#039;s end destination, you&#039;ve got to figure out if you&#039;re willing to risk signing for it.

				some vendors do that, simply move along and find another seller, the great thing here on SR is that we have a lot of choices , new vendors join every day and this site keep on growing<br /><br />Don&#039;t FE and never sign...why take that extra risk? as if buying illegal stuff is not enough

				I have signed for dozens of parcels in my name with dodgy content. <br /><br />All of them, signing to take delivery of a package that isn&#039;t addressed to me. Normally in the name of a former occupant. <br /><br /><br /><br />If you are at the stage where LEO are going to be busting you for getting something through the mail, you are probably fucked anyway- they will have enough for a warrant to enter the premises if they know that illegal substances have crossed the door whether it&#039;s signed for or not. After that, they find all the other illegal crap (bong with resin? mirror with razorblade?) and you are in trouble. <br /><br />The chances of police taking such an effort over amounts small enough to fit through the letterbox is pretty negligible though. They would want the supplier, and they probably know enough to know that other than a username on SR you know as much as they do. <br /><br />All illegal activities entail risk, and such risks should be minimized where possible, but when it&#039;s gotten to the point cops know if weed is getting to you then you are probably screwed regardless.
