				Going to transfer bitcoins from MTGOX to SR and the three choices I have are Green Address, Open Transaction (6 confirmations) or their fee based transfer which they say is faster.<br /><br />What is the difference between these and what do you recommend I do? Thanks.

				I tested this a while back. I sent one amount to mtgox, waited a couple days then did two transfers back one using green address and one without.&nbsp; It was a desktop btc app to mt gox and back sorta thing.&nbsp; First off to explain the three options.&nbsp; Green address means it comes from &quot;mt gox&#039;s account&quot; so to speak.&nbsp; Idea being someone waiting to get money from you could assume that if it came from that address it came from a legit place.&nbsp; Open transaction is meant for mt gox to mt gox transactions. Instead of the transaction happening internally on mtgox it goes through the network.&nbsp; Since you&#039;re transferring to SR it&#039;s always an open transaction.&nbsp; The fee, to be honest I&#039;ve never used a fee anywhere. Guess I&#039;m just cheap. But it&#039;s supposed to provide incentive for your transaction to go through faster.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know how much faster.<br /><br />With the green address it shows that it came from mtgox, click on that link and as of writing there&#039;s 39253 transactions from that address.&nbsp; I tried to find the exact source from that and couldn&#039;t<br /><br />Without using a green address it shows the source of the money came from 4 addresses.&nbsp; Going through those for a bit and I couldn&#039;t find any transactions that I did.&nbsp; So I didn&#039;t get my own bitcoins back to me.<br /><br />So using green address someone tracing would know it came from mt gox but that&#039;s it.&nbsp; Someone tracing a non green address will have to inspect the chain for a bit.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;d use the green address just to be sure I don&#039;t get my own back.&nbsp; Key thing to make it harder to trace is to break up the transactions.&nbsp; Say I want to get 5 bitcoins to SR.&nbsp; I&#039;d do something like 5&nbsp; 1btc transactions, or just pick a few random amounts.&nbsp; It makes it easier to trace if you see 4.82 bitcoins travel between a few addresses.

				Also just wanted to say make sure use different addresses each time.&nbsp; Sending 5 bitcoins over 5 transactions to one address proves nothing.<br /><br />(shortened versions because it lost my other one)

				(btw I indeed am just whoring your post to up my post count)<br /><br />You&#039;ll see actual coin tumbler services but a lot of people, including me, will just funnel it through mt gox.&nbsp; Since so many transactions happen there it makes it hard to figure out exactly the source of any of it. Even though I have some money I mined back in the day I never pay people directly from my wallet but through somewhere else first.&nbsp; Heck you can send it from mt gox to sr to the actual person if you have the patience

				So to be specific, I can enter my SR wallet address when withdrawing BCs from MTGOX and click the green address box, and the bitcoins will go into my SR wallet?&nbsp; Do you know the time frames for that?<br /><br />Thanks.
