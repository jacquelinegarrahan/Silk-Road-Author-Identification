				Title: <strong>I would've posted this under shipping but I'm &quot;new&quot; so I can't...</strong><br />

				Sup gang, just want some opinions on this scenario that I have with a vendor. <br /><br />On 6th May I ordered 2 different items from the same vendor (Domestic UK). A 3.5g package and a 7g package. <br /><br />On 7th May they were both marked &quot;in transit&quot;, and on the 8th I received the 3.5g package. I wasn&#039;t sure whether they would send them together in 1 package or as 2 separates but this answered my question. <br /><br />On the Friday (10th), I still had not received the 7, so I asked about this and the vendor said that when they have 2 packages going to the same address (not my home address I might add), they give it a couple of days in between. So I was cool about that, and then expected it by Monday/Tuesday. <br /><br />Anyway, long story short, this 2nd package has still not arrived, so from the 7th (when it said &quot;in transit&quot;) it&#039;s nearly been 2 weeks, but if going by what he said he might not have posted til the 10th ish... Either way - seems like a bit longer than should be for UK to UK? <br /><br />Do you think this package might have been either seized/lost, or do you think it might still turn up? <br /><br />I&#039;ve only been on the SR for 2 months, and had 7 perfect transactions til now, I don&#039;t want to finalize for a package that hasn&#039;t arrived (I finalized as soon as I received the other package) but I don&#039;t want my stats to make me look untrustworthy cos I&#039;m not trying to score some free gear, I just want what I&#039;ve paid for y&#039;know? :)<br /><br />Any advice, or any one had similar problems before? Cheers x

				Did you try contacting the seller?&nbsp; I&#039;d give it a little bit longer, but maybe report a discrepancy before the auto-finalization at 17 days.

				Just send it into resolution. Maybe it will speed up the vendors response. It has been a while.

				Yeah to be fair, I&#039;ve kept the vendor up to date all the way through, every few days or so - so that he doesn&#039;t think I&#039;m &quot;forgetting&quot; to finalize etc. 3 days ago he said &quot;not to worry&quot; yet, but by Tues/Weds, that will have been 2 weeks. <br /><br />Fingers crossed anyway I guess! I received the other one fine, so I don&#039;t have any reason to think the 2nd one wouldn&#039;t arrive...

				I should say I&#039;m not indicating the vendor has pulled a fast one BY ANY MEANS, I&#039;m just concerned the first one arrived so quick and easy, yet the 2nd one has yet to arrive... UK to UK shouldn&#039;t take 2 weeks right?<br /><br />It might turn up tomorrow morning and I&#039;ll be like &quot;oh&quot;. haha. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had to send this to the resolution centre now, which I really didn&#039;t wanna do so early in to my SR days! <br /><br />Part of me though does think that as he said 2 packages to the same address would be sent separately 2 days apart, that he&#039;s sent the first one (after putting BOTH packages as &quot;in transit), but then maybe forgot to take down the address for the 2nd package? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s been done on purpose, but I don&#039;t really know how to bring this up without sounding a little bit condescending. haha. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll order 2 things at once again in future! Wait for one to arrive before ordering the next - even if from the same vendor! Lesson learned perhaps.

				that is random behaviour, good luck with the resolution, but maybe just chalk it up to experience?

				Personally, If it hasn&#039;t arrived after 4 weeks, I would just write it off. If it was a large order $$$ wise then I would talk with the vendor and try get a refund. If it doesn&#039;t matter that much to you, then I would keep my perfect stats and find someone else.

				Contact the seller, resolve and give him an extension if need be.

				I think it is a normal practice for vendors to spread out shipments to the same address.<br /><br />This does seem like it is taking longer than it should for domestic, good luck OP.
