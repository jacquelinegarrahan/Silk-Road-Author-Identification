				For the people who have tried the cut fentanyl (synthetic heroin) floating around here on SR now or in the past I was wondering how does it compare to heorin? Like would it seem to the uninitiated as a very strong batch? Average? Also how good of a job is done on the mix usually? Ever encounter any &quot;hot spots?&quot;

				I had some fentanyllactose mix sent last spring and the lactose would turn hard in the spoon and if you havent to suck it up and shoot you got wierd heart effect, i had a blob of jelly pop outta the skin on my shin,still gotta scar, musta had nowhere to go, i dont know if i was doing something wrong, i tried heating, cold water, no matter what the cut claimed to be lactose would harden or almost turn wax, never got a rush, slighly took away dope sick when i snorted a line the size of the great wall of china, but never ordered again, im sure anyone thats bought presilk road knows the company im talking, others seemed to have good experience in trip report, but for me thats what happened, maybe im dumb, but ive shot alot of dope and have never had issues like that. The only other synthetic H ive had was from canada dude claimed it h till i called him out, i can tell from histamines, slightly morph/h allergic. But anyway, i was ordering ozs of acetylfentanyl from canada for months last spring/winter for cheap as fuck $1600, Im assuming the dude got busted cause he send me and oz on the front which i only paid half for, he changed his email everymonth may21st@soandso june21st@soanso. but when i came to pay last time, no answers, i tracked down what was supposedly his business partner and said dude got busted but offered me the same deal, never recieved anything, said he was gonna send it when they got their new factory set up in asia, nothing ever. Anyways the doses of this fentanyl, which hes lucky i did test shots or i would have died. This was pure acetyl fentanyl, 15 times weaker than normal fent, good for recreation. As far as shot size i only had to do like .03 30 mgs the first time to reverse dope sick, i went through ozs very quick eventually once i got to shooting .2. thats when i thought my life was over and finally succumbed to the mdone clinic.

				That&#039;s nuts about the jelly blob, thanks for the input. I&#039;m new here and when I look at the H selections all I can think of is the Heroin dealer scene in Pulp Fiction, lol like someone could actually become that now...
