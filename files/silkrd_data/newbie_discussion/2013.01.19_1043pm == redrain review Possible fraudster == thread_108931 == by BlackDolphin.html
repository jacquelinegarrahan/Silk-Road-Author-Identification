				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ca67215262<br />Vendor listed escrow 6g mxe, new guy but no other product was on the market, I guess this is what I get for not waiting.<br />Takes 17days to get a domestic letter and behold the order was 1gram 4mec<br />Up until this point seller had not read my messages slow shipping or even seemed concerned for me.<br /><br />Vendor claims he &quot;knows&quot; what he sent to me , than like his page claims he should be honest and refund as requested (this may be harder than I think)<br />

				Ya some vendors are cranky and overworked.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />For the record, I&#039;ve had three mistaken orders so far from different vendors , so they mix up packs for sure. . .&nbsp; &nbsp;I ordered 10g of hash And got 10 speed pills instead.&nbsp; Another was MDMA and got coke instead.&nbsp; The last was an order of weed and got meth hahaha.&nbsp; So, shit happens. BUT I got a reship on them all and also got to keep the first orders so I was ahead.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Your vendor should listen, but as a last resort you could need to send him a link to an anonymous image board and post a pict of your mistaken order&nbsp; .&nbsp; He should see the pict and recognize his packaging and see the error.&nbsp; Also.,&nbsp; there has to be another customer with your order saying the same thing?&nbsp; &nbsp; He thinks you are scamming him and you can&#039;t blame him as it happens a lot and they must be fed up,.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think if the vendor sees the image posted of his package and all the work you did you prove yur case, he should listen.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sux the you need proof though.&nbsp; &nbsp;Kinda snotty vendor though . He must be small time and struggling for dimes and pennies if he can&#039;t do it without breaking his bank.&nbsp; Jeese.<br /><br />I hope this helps.&nbsp; &nbsp;Scrub any images you post first so there is no data in the image ( save as bmp, then back to jpg). <br /><br />Damn. Too bad it wasn&#039;t in your favor.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />---&gt;!THe best option is dispute resolution.&nbsp; Don&#039;t release the funds to him.&nbsp; Click resolution .&nbsp; He won&#039;t get paid until he corrects the error.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is what you are suppose to do .&nbsp;
