				(I understand some people mine them with botnets, but I don&#039;t have the time to spread.)<br />Anyway, I have a little over 200 on me, and live in America. What would be the best way to get them?<br />

				I went through Bitinstant to email, told Bitinstant I was putting in $127 and the zipzap fee made it $130.95<br /><br />I came home and was a dollar short on $119 worth of product, and thankfully someone was kind enough to send me the .05 BTC.<br /><br />It was nice and quick, but that was kind of sad having to beg for money.

				Since you are in america, bitinstant is definitely the way to go. I usually do direct to address and get it sent to my personal wallet first. <br /><br />At this point, I am not sure mining is really worth it in the first place even if you have a medium sized botnet, as some of the ASIC units out there are fairly impressive in terms of hash capacity.
