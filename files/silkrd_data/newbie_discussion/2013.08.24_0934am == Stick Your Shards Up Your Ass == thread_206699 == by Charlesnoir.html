				If any of you dumb motherfuckers knew what real meth/dope is, you would know it is not these so-called &quot;shards&quot; that are going around everywhere today.<br /><br />If there are any real dope heads out there, you will remember that back in the early 1990&#039;s, the shit was powdery and soft rocks and would spin you out for days.<br /><br />All these new wannabe spun monkeys that think that there is any real dope in the &quot;shards&quot;, and all the people selling it should just end it all now.<br /><br />You are all stuck on no-dope.&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t know real dope if it bit you in the ass. <br /><br />Mexico makes most of the dope going around worldwide.&nbsp; When Ice came out in the early 2000&#039;s, it was in the form of &quot;shards&quot; and became hugely popular.&nbsp; Now Ice shards are rarely ever seen.&nbsp; What you dumb fucks are seeing and smoking is the perfection of mixing cut with real dope to create these No Dope Shards.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Mexicans figured out to mix cut with the meth in a re-rock form that looks similar to the Ice shards that have become legendary and scarce.&nbsp; <br />They have gotten so good at this in fact that no actual dope or meth is now in these shards, but is in fact all cut.&nbsp; <br /><br />These fake dope shards look like meth, smoke like meth and even test like meth (will test positive for meth on a marquis reagent test as there is some trace amount of dope in these fake rocks),&nbsp; and you will go to jail for the possession of meth if arrested with this counterfeit crap.<br /><br />But boys and girls, you do not get the effect of meth at all.&nbsp; What you get is an annoying, mind numbing stupor with no legs.&nbsp; You will feel like going to sleep and be stuck on stupid with no desire to do much of anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />To all the vendors who know better and continue to sell this bullshit as &quot;methamphetamine&quot;, you are committing fraud and know it.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you don&#039;t know any different, you have no business selling and promoting something you know nothing about, and you are committing fraud as well but look more like an idiot than a snake.&nbsp; <br /><br />Manufacturers of this fake shit are spending next to nothing and making millions off of the ignorance and desperation of the buyer.&nbsp; They will continue to do so as long as the demand remains. <br /><br />Take a stand against this Tyranny.&nbsp; DO NOT BUY COUNTERFEIT METHAMPHETAMINE.&nbsp; Save your hard earned Bitcoin and Demand Real Dope. <br /><br /><br />

				I can see where your coming from with this. I havnt personally been doing meth since the &#039;golden days&#039;, but i cant totally understand what your getting at here with the &#039;shards&#039; that are every where. <br /><br />Any way to tell the real shit from the fake shit? Or what vendor, if any, is or has been known to sell the real deal holyfield? <br /><br />

				I have always wondered about this and most of the older crew I know always say that these &#039;shards&#039; is not real crystal. They say ice is totally different to crystal meth... In regards to the effects of ice I always get those same feelings you mentioned. My go to guys will be like &#039;this shit is the bomb&#039; but when I have it, in an hour or 2 im tired, not chatty or even energetic. I feel &#039;high&#039; but im just notenergetic. I dont really fuck with &#039;ice&#039; no more for this reason...oh well...meh

				Some of the best meth coming out of Asia was/is Ice ...<br /><br />Testing kits show reactions to the drugs being present but not the amounts ..... BUT the quicker the reaction and the deeper/fuller the color,&nbsp; then thats usually a good indication to the amount/quality of the drug being tested for.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t run a testing kit on some shards&nbsp; I ordered and consumed but they were defiantly meth and&nbsp; in the good but not brilliant range.<br /><br />Brilliant fucking price compared to what we pay round these here parts tho ..... hahahaha<br /><br />God bless SR&nbsp;
