				started with a 1.2 mg then redosed with 0.6mg.. 15 minutes later and right after i told my friend.<br /><br />it kicks in. BAM! i am at an almost ego loss.i start to shiver because its something that i&#039;ve always feared.. then there was also abit of the unpleasant body high from the peaking.<br />i have to be honest and say that i did feel like i was dying. or i was worried at least. <br /><br />so i went for the benzos. half a dose.<br /><br />but the visuals were still amazing. when i closed my eyes it was like a million screens displaying sacred geometry in different shades oof red blue green. first time i experience seeing the colour black in my visuals.. never ever have i seen the colour black so apparent. but this time round, after redosing, many of the visuals had black in them.<br /><br />i&#039;d say i chickened out of the redose. bt next time if i redose, i will redose with .3mg instead of .6.. that might be more mangeable for me.<br /><br />but high recommended! safe for experienced users!@ have benzos!

				25i NBOME feels too sketchy for me to check out right now but it&#039;s tempting with it being so cheap and available in large quantity. It&#039;s just too new of an RC and seems like it has more downsides than upsides.

				25i tabs do very little for me, but when i tried snorting some it beat the crap out of me. it was amazing! highly recommend anyone who&#039;s tried the tabs to go on to the powder, but just watch out, the peak is about twice as strong and when it hits you&#039;ll sure as hell know it.<br /><br />my usual 25i tab dose in a night is anywhere between 4 and 8 but 2mg of the powder was enough for a much more intense experience than 8 tabs ever got me.<br /><br />try it out, just watch the dosage and definitely try the tabs before the powder

				Man, have I had a wonderful day today! I took two 25i nbome blotters around noon, and went hiking in the woods/mountains. I was outside for 6 hours, climbing and running, searching for the spots with the greatest view. Felt real energetic and got a good workout, the colours were crisp and beautiful and the scenery was in ultra-HD. When I sat down for some rest on a hill-top with a great view, the landscape around me morphed and twisted in beautiful ways. Really strange, my head felt almost normal but everything was floating around me. I had my mp3-player with me, and the music sounded like I was listening from under water. The sounds were stretching and bending almost like the view around me. It seems like the effects were strongest when I slowed down, shit got really weird whenever I sat down. If it got too heavy, I could just start walking/running faster and everything got relatively normal again. Felt really, really happy and wonderful shiverings and tingling sensations rippled through my body.<br /><br />These nbomes are really great!
