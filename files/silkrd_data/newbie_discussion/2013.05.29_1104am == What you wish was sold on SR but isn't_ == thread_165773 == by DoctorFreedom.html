				The products on SR are all great but I wish there would be some simple updates to the way the site works. Things like display prices in €, £, AUS$, CAN$ etc. would be really useful. Another would be if you could sort by more things such as price. Even better would be if the item page knew the weight of the item so you could search by weight or even better price/weight ratio (though this might lead to powders being cut to shit). Another would be to have an option to hide vendors who require FE. <br /><br />It&#039;s been at least a year since I first came on the site and the only change since then has been that weapons aren&#039;t allowed anymore (which I think is a good thing btw), it would be nice to see some other updates.

				You can convert currencies with Greasemonkey userscripts. It would change it when the page loads. Just look around userscripts.org and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find one that&#039;s recently updated and will work with firefox.

				It&#039;s not really a good idea to run scripts in tor. In fact I&#039;m not even sure if the tor browser bundle accepts add-ons. Maybe I&#039;m being paranoid but if I&#039;m ever unsure if something will compromise my anonymity on here I avoid it. I&#039;m sure 99% are fine but better safe than sorry.

				You can find the 3D laser printed gun on piratebay really easily. As for a 3D printer, they&#039;re not illegal so there are plenty of places to get them, they&#039;re just expensive.

				yeah i have found a few in my area but to use them for that wouldn&#039;t be allowed I couldn&#039;t imagine, the discovers (of the printed gun) think they will have smaller printers available really soon, for a cheaper price.

				TBH the only reason anyone needs to print a gun is that they can&#039;t get one legally, either because guns are illegal in their country or they&#039;ve committed felonies in the past. I don&#039;t think the 3D printed gun is a good idea and I&#039;m glad that it&#039;s so difficult to access. In fact, it&#039;s things like this which can stop the production of small domestic 3D printers so it&#039;s a bad idea for everyone and I wish it didn&#039;t exist. <br /><br />Within the next few months I don&#039;t doubt there will be a murder committed by someone using a 3D printed gun (if it hasn&#039;t happened already) and it&#039;s going to taint the reputation of this fantastic technology.

				Mandrax or Quaaludes. ALSO... look this one up folks, it was prescribed to me in the late 70&#039;s and it was totally amazing that they would put the combination up for sale via a MD, legal drug pusher. It made you feel so good that they outlawed it well before quaaludes. It was called Desbutal. It was a legal speed ball consisting of a healthy dose of Desoxyn and Phenobarbital. It made you open the door for strangers entering buildings and give away cabs on a rainy day in Manhattan just for fun. Then do a quaalude to come down with a little pure flake coke to keep you awake to enjoy the combination with a glass of fine champagne and a cute little runway model (coke whore) to tie it all together, ahhh, the 80&#039;s! Whatever happened to Black Beauties? (biphetamine sulfate)?

It made you open the door for strangers entering buildings and give away cabs on a rainy day in Manhattan just for fun. Then do a quaalude to come down with a little pure flake coke to keep you awake to enjoy the combination with a glass of fine champagne and a cute little runway model (coke whore) to tie it all together, ahhh, the 80&#039;s!

It also produces very little to zero smoke / odor, depending on how you use it.<br /><br />It&#039;s conspicuous in that it doesn&#039;t look like something common, like the e-cigs. I could see something like those being a good idea for hash oil smoking, if the temperature were right. Blending in plain sight is always best.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if e-cigs are allowed on planes though; smoking is forbidden on all US flights at least, and I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re OK with vaporizing.

				I think they should have a craft beer or alcohol section.&nbsp; There&#039;s a big market for rare craft beers and beer tbats only available in certain areas. Also a liquor section would be great, too. I&#039;ve had access to lots of high-end bottles that I could&#039;ve sold for 2/3 or less the regular prices and would consider selling bottles on sr.
