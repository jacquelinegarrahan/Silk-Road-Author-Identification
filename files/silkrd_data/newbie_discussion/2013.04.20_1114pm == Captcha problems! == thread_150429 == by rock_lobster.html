				Hey all<br />So, I&#039;ve been suffering badly with the captchas here. I tried for 2 days&nbsp; to register until I found out that the only way to get the captcha right for me, is listening to them. The letters I see are never good (and I promise I&#039;m not high, that&#039;s why I came here in the first place ;).<br />So, if I ask to listen for the captchas, I&#039;m usually good (though it&#039;s damn hard to tell some like &quot;B&quot;, &quot;T&quot; or&nbsp; &quot;P&quot;).<br /><br />Anyone else with same problem? Im running the vidalia browser, in an ubuntu box.<br /><br />THanks in advance, and greetz all!

				Hi,<br />&nbsp;I had the same problem..what a pain in the ass...check that you have the CORRECT link for SR, if you&#039;re has a &quot;.TO&quot; in the url, it is a phising site and you should remove it immediately you are NOT safe<br />correct url is silkroadvb5piz3r/onion

				For whatever reason I and others I&#039;ve spoken to have had to fill it out 2 or 3 times before it allows us to log in.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what could be causing it.

				They all suck on here.&nbsp; I was unaware but after 50 or 100 posts (can&#039;t remember which), they are no longer required.&nbsp; It was a wonderful surprise.

				Ok, so indeed there was a problem with the &quot;.to&quot; in my SR link, thanks.<br /><br />But I still have the same problem with posting in the forum, captchas go totally mad on me =/<br /><br />From what I can gather, it seems i see an &quot;older&quot; captcha than the system &quot;thinks&quot; i should be seeing, but the sound is correct.<br />So I listen to one, and if I fail, then I see the one I just listened to. They seem to be de-synchronized.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Well just in case anyone has the same problem, it was all due to using the &quot;onion.to&quot; link I had found, instead of the plain &quot;onion&quot; one. The first day here I was using that one (not phishing, but not pure Tor, and very bad for what I&#039;ve learned) and had all those problems. They went away as soon as I corrected the link!
