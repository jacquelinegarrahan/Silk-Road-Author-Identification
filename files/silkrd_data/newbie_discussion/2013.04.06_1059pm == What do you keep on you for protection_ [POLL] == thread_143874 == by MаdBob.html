				I think it&#039;s good to carry a knife or multi-tool.&nbsp; They come in handy and you can use it to defend yourself.&nbsp; I think the legal limit is a 3 or 4 inch blade, but if you have a concealed carry permit you can carry any size.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good idea to get your concealed carry permit so you can exercise your 2nd amendment right to carry a gun legally.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel the need to carry all the time, but I like having the option.<br /><br />An important note is if you are convicted of a felony you aren&#039;t allowed to possess a firearm.&nbsp; Understand what laws you are bending and be careful and discrete with your drug use.&nbsp; Power to the people!

Most of the time a H&amp;K 40 cal compact.. but I have been known to swap out for my H&amp;K 9mm as well <br /><br />I always have a knife in my car and there is a good chance I have one on me some place as well. <br /><br />I always say its better to be safe then sorry..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Why the 40 and the 9mm? Couldn&#039;t qualify on 40 the first time ? You must have done something good to be able to qualify with your own sidearm.<br /><br />PS How did you like Quantico?<br /><br />Have a good one, Ma&#039;am.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Very very funny... LOL<br /><br />&nbsp;Nah.. I have a very LARGE bust line 38 triple D my 40cal is a compact and my 9mm is a full frame.. with some clothing I can&#039;t carry the full frame shoulder or hip.. it shows too much.. I do not live in an open carry state so brandishing can get you in trouble here.. <br /><br />I had the 9mm first then bought the compact 40.. Honestly.. I wish they were the other way around.. a compact 9mm and a full frame 40.. but oh well.. I guess that just means I have to buy more guns!! LOL <br /><br />&nbsp;My ex and bestfriend carries a Springfeild XD as do about 6 of my other friends. They are alright.. but I still love my H&amp;Ks... I would love to get my hands on a p5<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m glad you find this amusing .&nbsp; What does a large bust line has to with anything ?&nbsp; Counterweight analogy works with anything but handguns.&nbsp; The thing is with 40 S/W that is a peculiar round.&nbsp; With good amount of female shooters that I have been around .&nbsp; Nobody likes the 40 cal for an exception of a friend who is now a FED.&nbsp; Some shooters were gym rats , some were large chested .&nbsp; All in all, the only complaint they had was the pain in the wrists due to recoil. Most of them work with guns for a living .H&amp;K P7 , is that what you meant ?&nbsp; If my memory serves me correct p5 is not produced by HK or imported by Springfield . Springfield XD has been a cop gun for the most part and rarely used&nbsp; by civilians unless it&#039;s for competitive shooting .&nbsp; 40 cal screams federal to anybody who knows guns . Hk is strange for a woman.&nbsp; Rare gun on the street , special order in most gun shops at least in 40 cal .&nbsp; You are a user and run a HK and 40 cal .&nbsp; Was not born yesterday, dear. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;Yeah I think its funny that you think I&#039;m a cop based on the type of pistols that I like.. <br /><br />As for a bustline.. I have MASSIVE BREAST and a good chunk of the time I like to wear a shoulder holster .. Go buy your self a 38DDD Bra.. Fill up&nbsp; a water balloon to fill each up and put it on.. Now try and put on a shirt, a holster and a blazer on top of that and tell me how easy it is for you to move? much less not have the imprint showing thru what your are wearing or flash someone when you have the jacket unbuttoned..&nbsp; It depends on what I am wearing as to what gun I carry.. Some outfits allow me to carry a full frame and others only a compact..&nbsp; &nbsp;I really don&#039;t expect you to understand its like trying to get men to understand breastfeeding..&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />&nbsp;I have two H&amp;K USPs both Blue coated the SS would have made a better choice as they are both showing holster wear now.. I have been told that you can re-blue them but I&#039;ve not looked into it. I picked out the H&amp;K based on what felt right.. I tried a few Kimbers I don&#039;t like the grip and that safty thing they like to use on the grip that you have to squeeze... (I&#039;m about to sound like a girl) Sadly really as I thought they were really pretty guns.. Some of the scroll work and handles are stunning..... I tried a 1911, Para ordnance it was a .45 and my fathers gun...He had it really tweeked and I did not care for it.. I found that single stacks are too thin.. I like double stacks as they make the handle thicker.. I have large hands for a female, I am in no way a small girl.. I hate Glocks YUCK.. they just feel cheap even.. The Khar 9mm that my ex had bit me every time I loaded the mag and the slid would tear up my hand.. I was told that I was holding it too high but I never could grip the little thing any other way.. I SUCK at revolvers My ex&#039;s mother owns a Taurus and I was lucking if my groups were in the 12&quot; range <br /><br />&nbsp;With out giving out too much info.. My Father owns more guns then he can keep count of.. He had to get a dealers lic. in the state that he lives in to legally own the amount of firearms that he does. He is a card carrying member of the NRA and a stanch Libertarian.. While we do not agree on a lot of things.. He did teach me more then a little bit..&nbsp; I wont do re-loads like he does. Kinda scares me to be truthful..<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m picky I know that.. I have the same issue with cars too.. I&#039;m a gear head.. ( Imports)&nbsp; My shotgun is also top end.. its a Benelli the older one tho not the new one.. I have a few others too but they are all for the range and you don&#039;t need a full list of what I own.. <br /><br />&nbsp;as for Caliber.. 9mm is a high velocity round.. I live in a pretty big city and a 9mm can easily over penetrate ...The 40cal is a lower velocity round and with some sort of safty round like a glazer round I know I am not going to shoot my kids sleeping in the next room if someone breaks in.. I drive nice cars and we live in an area where car Jacking occur .. I like knowing that if I am going into an area of the city where something might happen that I can load up the 40cal and shoot thru my car door if I need to.. Yeah I might be a bit paranoid but ya know what? I&#039;m still alive and&nbsp; never been in jail.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m not a cop or a fed..nether are my friends.. LOL.. tho.. Two of them do work for local security firms and a few of them are ex military.. I really dont know where you get your info from but I guess it would depend on the part of the country you are in.. Here the police almost all carry glocks and they are 9mm.. We had some riots here a while back and the local PD asked if they could have 40 or 45&#039;s and they were told no.. that the city was not going to upgrade their armory..I have never seen a cop with an XD here.. but I did see one in the pawn shop the other day.. LOL&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I just had to look it up.. Not the p5...the MP5 Oops my bad.. I also want a Mark25 the gun that the SEALs helped create and carried up until a few years ago.. its a 45APC if you are not familiar with it.. My best friend wants a AR-15 pretty bad.. I really don&#039;t understand that.. He goes on and on about the rail and all the crap you can add too it.. I think I must get this glazed over look on my face when he starts in about it now so he shuts up. LOL..&nbsp; I did order one of my H&amp;Ks from gun broker online and the other at a local gun show since you think that they only come from specialty dealers.. There is even a sports store up the road from me ( about 10 mins) that carries them.. YES, they are harder to find then say a glock but I have even seen them in Pawn shops here locally.. <br /><br /><br />OH and since someone said something.. In my state you can get a &quot;permit&quot; of sorts for silencers.. Its a $200 fee PER each one that you own ...I&#039;m not sure 100% what they will and wont allow you to have in regards to that.. a buddy of mine that use to own a range and a gun shop told me about it..

				Believe what you will.. there is nothing int he universe that anyone can say to change your mind.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Point of reference.. IF someone was a LEO don&#039;t you think that A. they would stay out of a topic like this.. B. NOT post what they really carry but what they have seen &quot;thugs&quot; carry? <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m only posting what I know to be true, what is in my life and what happens here.. I&#039;m not you nor so I live where you are.. But unless you are a LEO You don&#039;t know all that you claim ether.. I doubt that you know the gun laws for each and every state in the union as well as the local laws in of the cities there in.. There are cities int eh country that you are only permitted so many firearms in the city limits ...... Case and point for cities being different then the state that they are in.. NYC.. the laws for firearms are different in NYC then they are in the state of NY..<br /><br />&nbsp;SO I guess maybe you are ATF &#039;cus you are reeking of it then if you know each and every single gun law in the WHOLE country!! <br /><br />Your assumptions are foolish at best.. <br /><br />I also doubt that you have the exp that you state that you do if you think hand size has nothing to do with it.. I have large hands and the wrist that they connect to.. Um.. Yeah large as well DUH.. someone, lets say female with small hands is going to have small wrist too so yeah they would have issues with a 40cal.. You are one hell of a jack ass yo assume that all woman are built the same and can only handle so much.. I wont shoot a 50cal.. again that shit hurt.. But a 40 is fine ..&nbsp;

				I agree with Dark. hammer bite is not dependent on size of hands rather the positioning and limp wristing when holding the weapon. Although im not sure about the firing a Barrett standing when high, you would have to be majorly fucked up in order to retain control when firing standing.

				You are correct I am in the south&nbsp; :P LOL<br /><br />&nbsp;I only ONCE, shot a firearm while not totally sober and that was a massive mistake and I knew better but it happen.. It was a beat up Remington 12g that tore up my shoulder.. First time I shot a 12 g.. I held it wrong too.. MASISIVE black and blue mark that was larger then the span of my hand easy.. I was chicken to shoot another shotgun for years after that.. (damn peer pressure) NEVER give in too peer pressure kids!!&nbsp; I think its harder on girls.. You get a pack of guys riding your ass for not wanting to do or try something and despite knowing its a bad idea.. Yeah.. <br /><br />&nbsp;when I wasin my earily 20&#039;s I had all four of my wisdom teeth taken out.. One side got kinda inflamed and a bit infected.. a week later it was still really sore and giving me issues but I went with my best friend out to the range anyways.. ( we have a really really nice indoor one here that is state of the art.. at least back in 2003 when it was built.. it&#039;s still the nicest in the area) Some guy that was friends with the same ranger officer that we knew brought in some Full Auto H&amp;K riffle, it had been modded to be full auto or something.. I had never fired anything like that much less held one .. I was told it was a $15,000 rifle.. Anyways.. I went down on the end and my BF other friend was there with us and went with me ( he&#039;s also ex military) Well I squeezed really softly and popped off a few rounds and I think most all of them missed the target... they friend starts yelling at me that I am doing it wrong and grabs my head and slams the sore cheek into the butt of the riffle. I instantly has a mouth of blood and started to cry.. I really did not ever want to shot the damn thing to start with but peer pressure from a pack of guys wanting to see a woman shoot this thing won.. and I regretted big time..&nbsp; ended up back at the dentist office having to have new suitors put back in and had a black and blue bruise on the side of my face for at least three weeks.. I kept being asked if I got in a fight.. <br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s really unfair that so many men have preconceived notions about woman and guns much less cars.. I can pretty much pull my entire motor apart and put it back together again Yet guys want to try and offer to change my oil and crap..&nbsp; :o I try not to pass judgment on anyone for anything.. They will always show their true colors given time.. No matter who they are.. In some way shape or form.. I think trying to tell someone they are LEO due to the sort of gun they own is just as silly as saying I am a rich snob because I drive a Lexus, a BMW or a Acura..&nbsp; You don&#039;t know what I paid for my car so how can you assume that any more then you can tell someone what they do for a living by their choice in firearms..

				Yeah.. NETHER are ever going to happen..!! EVER!!<br /><br />&nbsp;They have this big 50cal thing on a stand at one of the ranges I go to.. They are always trying to get me to shoot the damn thing..&nbsp; It scares the hell out of me! There is just no way!! Then they tell me I am just being a girl!! And I smile and say &quot;YUP!&quot; I have learned my lesson about firing things that scare me.. DON&#039;T DO IT!&nbsp; EVER!

				Eh, That is also a grain of salt.. That would depend on how good their social engineering skills are.. I put up an awesome game.. I had a friend last year that said they thought that I brought in well over six figures.. I have known this person a very long time mind you.. they were blown away when I told them what our real income at the time was..&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Someone who knows what they are doing can fit in nearly any place.. I can go to Miami and stay in a 5 star hotel for a week and fit in just fine ( BTW the W. down there is wonderful.. the Concierge&nbsp; level is wonderful!) or I can go to NYC and hang in queens.. I have had a wonderful time in Malibu and on Sunset strip and crashed at some place up in the Hollywood hills for a month..&nbsp; You are just judging the book by its cover again dear.. In my daily life my biggest give away is my hair, nails and make up.. I am not what you would call normal, I have an edgy look most of the time. But if I want to I can look like a librarian who get paid min wage or I can look like&nbsp; a movie Star and walk into a top rated restaurant any place.. <br /><br />its a TINY details that give people away.. Someone who has teeth that need to be straightened, Someone who has black head or ruff hands.. These tell you what they real social status is.. YES those too can be&nbsp; fixed with time and money! But the average person.. its a tell.. They can be wearing $500 worth of clothing, have a Movado on and a coach bag... if it looks like they need braces well. I&#039;m willing to bet they live in a tiny house and work their ass off..&nbsp; Its also tiny details like &quot;fakes&quot; I can spot a fake Coach or LV bag at ten feet!! LOL.. There has only been a few that I really really have to look at to figure out!&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some really great fake Rolex&#039;s in my time too.. The best tells are things that people don&#039;t think about.. they way they move, how they hold them self, HOW they speak to others.. That will tell you more about a person then what they are wearing, eating or saying (choice of words)<br /><br /><br />FROM THE HIP! Man I don&#039;t even like using my M1 that way.. :( I always seem to knock my back out..

				You are right on with that.. <br /><br />Thankfully, I&#039;m from a part of the south, that not really the south.. LOL.. its one of only a few tiny parts of the country that are considered to be General American&nbsp; ... If I&#039;m not careful tho.. I can sound a bit southern but that&#039;s is due to where my grandparents and father are from&nbsp; all &quot;TRUE&quot; Southerners.. If I get lazy or want to sound cute.. its pretty easy to sound like a southern bell.. People try to place where I am from a lot.. The only thing I can&#039;t pull off well is sounding like I am from California .. I can a bit, but I sound more Norther Cali then anything.. and my Boston is a little off.. I sound a little too much NY <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll tell you tho.. Guys are a sucker for a girl with a cute southern sound at the right times.. I&#039;m sure my build helps too! :) I blow people minds some times.. I end up with free shit, massive discounts and people bending over backwards for me and I don&#039;t even mean too do it.. I&#039;m not the blonde bomb shell with a tight body ether if that is what your thinking.. Pretty much all the men I know say I am far above average I would say I&#039;m an7/8 if I lost some weight and hit the gym I might hit a 9 .. But its more how I carry myself and adjust to the people around me.. It tends to keep you safe as well.. Less reasons to have to use the protection that I carry.. There are a few places we go a lot and my other half says that I walk in like I own the place.. I always get top service as well.. <br /><br />&nbsp;My other half, like my self was a military brat so he also lacks an accent, but he spent a large chunk of time in the &quot;DEAD&quot; south right in the middle of the bible belt so if he gets lax or is not paying attention you can hear it bleed thru just a tiny bit.. I does not carry, but&nbsp; knife.. I want to get him his CC permit and get him some range time then pick out something nice for him to carry.. I am not sure what to go with tho.. :/ I think I will do the same thing with him that I did and just go to a couple of the local ranges and rent a few and let him try them all out till he finds what he likes.. a lot of time other people at the range if you talk to them will let you use theirs a bit too.. that is how I found the H&amp;K..

Never judge a book by it&#039;s cover .&nbsp; Especially in that line of work .<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />luckily i&#039;m not in that line of work and would never work for the military. i don&#039;t agree with their actions in general or the way they follow orders from politicians with hidden agendas...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you referring to the big military or smaller specialty units ? Does that apply to the units that specialize in counter terrorism ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the whole damn thing. i tend to empathise with terrorists. i don&#039;t support terrorism but i get why they&#039;d be pissed at people invading their countries and bombing the shit out of innocent people. i&#039;m too high for this...

				I cant empathize with Terrorist any more then I can for the military industrial complex.. BUT there is a difference between our troops, That I support full hardheartedly , and the Military Industrial Complex.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I personally believe that the &quot;powers that be&quot;&nbsp; are the one behind the terrorist events in this country.. its all about money and keeping people scared!

I&#039;m a writer, nothing more, nothing exciting. I just hope everyone gets a good chuckle or head scratch from my nonsense.<br /><br />On another thought, I have great respect for all our armed services and emergency personnel. Conspiracy theory is a category of entertainment that I do not take seriously. It&#039;s a fun stoner game, but I leave it there. I like seeing what people have to say to garbage, so I post it. I appreciate people that like to keep forums clean.

				We were both in very abusiveness relationships / marriages and had ended up in very dark places both wanting death more then anything.. Both thinking of and nearly going thru what what we thought we be the best way to do it.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I never liked the term ether.. never used it always laughed at people who did... Till I met him.. I know its cliche&#039;&nbsp; sounding and all girly but its true and I understand it on so many levels <br /><br />&nbsp;I / we had both lost the meaning of marriage till we had each other.. We will get married one day.. It really just money keeping us from doing it now, last week, last year ect. Other thing are so much more important and have to come first and we both know we are were we should be.. Most people assume we are married and don&#039;t know better unless we tell them.. When out in public we get comments a lot asking how long we have been together or just met as we have the high energy together.. We are told that we rot teeth among other sugar sweet type comments <br /><br />Sorry to hear of your partner&nbsp; :&#039;(

				A smile and personality. That goes much farther than a bullet, in my opinion. I&#039;m as anti-social as they come, but there&#039;s something about a laugh and a question about themselves that puts people at ease. I&#039;ve avoided many confrontations this way. Actually, the only physical confrontation I haven&#039;t avoided was with an ex-girlfriend who came at me with a knife. Shrug. Some people.
