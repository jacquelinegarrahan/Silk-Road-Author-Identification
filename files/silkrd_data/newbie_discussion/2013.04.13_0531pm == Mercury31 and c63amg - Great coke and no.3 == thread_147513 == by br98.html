				&quot;Help me Jebus&quot;<br />&nbsp;you gotta warn people how strong your shit is, even cut 1 on 1, it would still class as best street shit of all time for most - Mercury31 cristal ( fuck Suri krijt, cristal altijd better)<br /><br />@Pineapple, do a lab test <br /><br />c63amg&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;no.3 is nearly jumping of the foil which for less experienced means very strong<br /><br />A token of respect for 2 sellers on SR that can deliver good shit :)<br /><br />A poster from a little country that brought you 20+%(THC) weed i.e. Dutch Skunk

				Hello Everybody,<br /><br /><br />We are working on SR for longer than a year now and the site went down for 5-7days a few months ago and came back up and running even better then before.<br /><br />Everybody wants SR to run smooth both buyers and sellers and therefor we have to give the whole Sr staff the time that they need to secure and renew the site whenever necessary. <br />Keep in mind that they are also losing money every day that SR is offline and people cant access there accounts, so they will do everything in there power and even beyond that to get SR up and running again ASAP.<br /><br />i don&#039;t have a good view on the other markets that are operating but my advice to everybody that&#039;s been messaging me about going to other markets is to wait until SR is back up and have faith in the community.<br />Because going to a different market will not mean that it will not have the same problems. (The Grass Looks Always Greener At The Neighbors)<br /><br /><br />There is a holiday at the moment in Holland so not one vendor from NL can ship packages today.<br /><br /><br />The BTC price is fluctuating strong at the moment and is very vulnerable.<br />Some people are loosing money the same hour that they bought Btc and others are making profit.<br /><br />For all the people that lost a lot of money in the last few days or weeks, there is going to be a compensating in the form of discount on most of our listings for at least 2 weeks so that everybody can smile again.<br />When SR is online there will be more info about the discounts.<br /><br /><br />Too all the SR members from USA and AU we will switch all of our listing from europion union to shipping worldwide in 1-2week give us some time to adjust a few things to operate successful thru the account c63amg because working with a second account and more people can cause a lot of headache. That&#039;s why we closed cls63amg and will operate worldwide thru c63amg in 1-2weeks so that we have everything in our own hands. There will be free samples shipped out when we our ready to ship worldwide to test the packages stealth and to let everybody sample our products.<br /><br /><br />Hoping that we informed everybody enough.<br />lets all pray and wait till SR is online again so that everything turns to normal again.<br /><br /><br /><br />For all soccer lovers or people that just like to win something, there is a champions league game tonight between<br />Real Madrid - FSB Dortmund <br /><br />The first person that can guess the final score correct will get a gift coupon of 100USD that they can exchange in our shop only.<br /><br />Here is the link for the thread to put your final score: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153596.0<br /><br />Type your winning score in the form as written below<br />for example:&nbsp; Real Madrid - FSB Dortmund 2-3<br /><br /><br />Be quick cause we will not accept scores after the first half of the match.<br />And the first person that got the score correct will get the coupon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />c63amg<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />
