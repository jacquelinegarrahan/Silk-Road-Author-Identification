				Just wondering.. if my account was ever compromised by LE, can they use my feedback history as evidence of crimes committed? Is there a way to unlink them from visibility in my account? Or, shit, what about my stats?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had an account and have been purchasing here for about 6 months and I&#039;m wondering if it would be a good idea to ditch my account and make a new one every so often so I don&#039;t have such a paper trail with my transactions.&nbsp; The trade off would of course be losing my rep which I&#039;d really rather not do.&nbsp; I know there probably isn&#039;t a solid answer to this.. but has anyone thought about it?

				<br />I would think that just being on this site at all would be a risk. If they brought they hammer down on you and had your real identity and could link your user id to you they could then bring in your account history to use against you.<br /><br />I think it would be a bit of a stretch though. Really they cannot prove anything based on them.

				Yeah proving it was you would be difficult (not impossible).&nbsp; But if they COULD prove the account was yours, is it something that could be used against you in court?
