				IF you&#039;re already live in a &quot;normal&quot; (not 3rd world, poor) country. I think you are American. Then You should just try to find some job, from kitchen worker,pizza maker till something else just go and ask. If you don&#039;t want to work go to job-office and ask for a grant.

				If you&#039;re anywhere near a decently sized city, look on craigslist under the sublets section. They only want cash, and you can find good apartments or rooms this way, occasionally for a pretty good discount, for weeks or even months at a time. And I&#039;ve not come across someone who wanted to sublet their place for anything other than cash. Alternatively, assuming you&#039;re near a city, you could get a prepaid debit card and check out airbnb. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not near a city, small-ish towns frequently have motels with very agreeable rates. <br /><br />Five grand is a lot of money for someone in your situation. You&#039;ll be fine. In fact, use it as an opportunity to step outside your comfort zone a little bit. Buy a one-way plane ticket to a city you&#039;ve always wanted to visit (can you do that in cash? I don&#039;t know if you can anymore, but maybe someone with a credit card will help you out if you pay them the price of the ticket), find a cheap sublet or hostel and enjoy yourself. If you&#039;re in Europe, get on a train. There are hostels everywhere. Go places. Do things. See the world. You&#039;ll learn quickly that things aren&#039;t nearly as bad as you think they are.<br /><br />Good luck.

				if you have to go fast, then sure go to this place, but keep your options open, you should be able to find something cheaper, but then again, I guess it depends on your &#039;income&#039;&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />As for getting &#039;goods&#039; ... sure people get mail to hotels, no reason it&#039;s any more or less &#039;suspects, except it will probably be delivered to &#039;reception&#039; ... which is a VERY&nbsp; weak link in the &#039;chain of security&#039;! ;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t rush, and for the moment, dont take too many drugs, a clear/er head ALWAYS helps in this type of scenario, even when&nbsp; you DO KNOW&nbsp; &#039;what to do&#039;!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />It could be as someone said, a great adventure, be cool, be polite and stay safe&nbsp; :)<br /><br />all the best matey<br /><br />m m m motek&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				<br />I am all for subletting a room from someone. I rented a room from a middle aged couple with a family when I was younger. It was cheap. Like 500 a month with everything included and very private with a side entrance to their basement. Craigslist is your best bet for that.<br /><br />The thing is don&#039;t stress. You are young and have a little cash. You can stretch 5 grand a long way if you careful. One day you will look back at these days with a fond smile and laugh.<br /><br />Pm me with any troubles you run into.
