				Finding myself naked, ashamed, and incapable of any further productive thought processes...This is a familiar situation, no doubt. For the second time in the last couple months, I am nearing the conclusion of +8 hours of heavier than average cocaine use. My eyelids are heavy, chest - tight. Contained within, a ventricular cycle of heartbeat frantically struggling to maintain bodily function. ...I ask myself a few questions...just how dangerous is this?? ...And what possible repercussions are of highest concern?<br /><br />I am healthy ~26 with no prior cardiovascular/central nervous medical conditions...<br />Regardless, from the perspective of an outsider, one would be safe in suggesting a reduction in magnitude of intake. If I am concerned, that is the obvious answer, but for the sake of discussion, and please if anyone feels knowledgeable on the subject, feel free to chime in...<br /><br />...If I was to maintain a healthy lifestyle with the exception of an infrequent cocaine binge a few times a year...What sort of risks do I run, short/long term, and what are the odds of a certain side effect surfacing? Perhaps someone has an unorthodox suggestion or maybe a personal experience with this? <br /><br />Thanks

				I would suggest activating your third eye thru meditating and detoxing your body and lookin into the sun at the last and irst our of the day when the UV lights is weak but the healing energies are high..<br /><br />I have heard that cocain makes it easier to get into the 4th dimension so i would meditate on cocan if I had some but I would not even go there since i would probably love it to much.<br /><br />The third eye is the evidence that we are sungods / children of the sun / children of the most high, and we gots some real powers when the third eye is open and active and those problems you have is nothing once you get in contact with your higher self since he/you can heal anything you just dont know how powerfull you are in the third eye.<br /><br />Stop using flouride is step one since that is a poison that places a bonematerial around your pineal gland and it makes it hard to use the third eye, it imobalizes it and the flouride in the tapwater is just there so people can put the mark of the beast in the forehead by calcifying the pinealgland, its possible to decalcify it by eating green plants tho so its never to late for anyone who still got a soul.<br /><br />they say that as fast as we go to hospitals we are slapping our higher self in the face and the hospitals always got that serpent logo because they are symbolising that they own your kundalini since you come to them for cures when you a damn sungod that can heal anything if you just get that third eye going so you gets your powers.<br /><br />Myself I remote view and i had the kundalini serpent of energy crawling up my lower spine it was amazing feeling and it did not hurt but they say it can hurt if you got toxins in your body.<br /><br />Okey now I just spewed my thought here just because you wrote that we should share some opinions.<br /><br />Take care man and please let us know how it goes.<br /><br />Much love

				Everyone has a different physiology and psychology, it&#039;s impossible to tell how much harm you&#039;re doing, as it&#039;s subjective.<br />Take care, cocaine is a dangerous drug, I know this because I used to do loads myself.. then stopped and found it&#039;s left me maybe not physically, but definitely psychologically, &#039;impaired&#039; with heavy, but manageable anxiety problems.<br /><br />Diggity check yourself before you wreck yourself man.

				Thanks for the interesting responses...<br /><br />...At some point in your life, you likely have come to a similar conclusion as this...<br /><br />One thing I have noticed about myself is that I am unable to use coke in a limited/controlled amount. When I use, I use a lot. Perhaps this lends itself to the notion that coke is not the drug for me.<br /><br />I love drugs. I love the idea of experimenting responsibly. And perhaps if I am unable to control myself on a certain substance, then maybe I should steer clear of said substance. This seems to be the answer...and it saddens me, but for the sake of living a long, healthy life, I will soon stop using. My will to survive and flourish is stronger than the will to seek narcotic induced pleasure.

BUT you can also tell him7you to give you other peoples memories so if you want to see how Hitler lived then you can just ask for it and you will gets to see it from Hitlers eyes how he was living. Hard to lie to some people if they are connected to that &quot;memorylibrary&quot; and your higher self.<br /><br />Write shit down, always keep a pen and paper with you and read it an write your thought and what you want to do and everything and I promise you that you will see some extraordinary stuff happening.<br /><br />Like I said, I remote viewed but I flew also since my body was sleeping so you can do alot of things with it. i should had turned around and looked at my body tho since I thouught I was my body until I jolted back into my fysical body , i kinda jumped into my body and it was like a shock I woke up with a real jump.

				wow- good stuff people- let those crazy juices flow!<br />OP- cocaine is a hell of drug and has ruined many many lives- so beware- take care-<br />also it is my understanding that prolonged use of drugs that are altering levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin ( which is why you fell great when using ) can alter the brains ability to produce these transmitters normally- now will one or two binges a year cause permanent damage ? IDK -also as you mentioned there are cardiac issues to consider, but the human body can really survive a tremendous amount of abuse however i think all things take a toll<br /><br />but hey you only live once so take responsibility for your actions and enjoy yourself

				To say you only live once is kinda true but you will have a billion different lives in different bodies after eachothers and what you do in this life will deside what you will become in the next life. Karma is law.<br /><br />Eat the animals and you will be eaten like a animal and then reborn as a animal to see that perspective you thought you wanted to never see when you was mentaly sick in this life so you did not see it as animal cruelty when cattle gets tortured and killed.<br /><br />You can never be free unless you let the animals be free, and its a induvidual thing, if you eat animals you create karma on yourself until you gets it and knows youre a part of animal cruelty because schools and religions tricked you into believeing youre a scavanger like a rat when youre reallya herbavore in the design and you got alot of love for our animal friends.<br /><br />Youre all so cute when you think your life will end and you have accepted it that you will not exist after this so who cares if you is a part of animal cruelty and destroying the homeplanet for future generations haahaha, it is sick mentaly since its ALOT of people who have been dead and has the balls to tells people what happened when they died, since they did not spot to exist they left thier fysical body.<br /><br />Death does not exist like you think it does, but I guess you will have to &quot;die&quot; before you gets to know the truth that it is no end and that you should had listened to your inner feelings telling you right from wrong. You know its wrong eating animals but they keep the door to the slaughterhouse closed and tell you that the animals are treated well when they torture and kill them behind closed doors. You wont look inside the door anyway since then you would stop eating animals instantly.<br /><br />Internet prophet at your service!<br /><br />You a slave Neo!
