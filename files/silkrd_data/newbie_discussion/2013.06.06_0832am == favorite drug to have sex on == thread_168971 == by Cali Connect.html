				It really depends.<br /><br />I mean I haven&#039;t done any psychedelics, that&#039;s why I&#039;m getting involved on SR, that and the weed, but between alchohol and weed I&#039;d say weed is a better sensation.

				Ecstacy pills a few times and partying then getting it on in a hotel room were some amazing experiences. I&#039;m on Rx opiates for years so it&#039;s difficult for me to urinate or orgasm, but some of those sex sessions were mind-blowing :)

				Meth makes my cock limp but I find it to be the best sex drug, with a bit of Cialis. Even without Cialis, I find I&#039;m far less embarrassed by limp-dick-syndrome and more willing to torture my dick to erection. It releases inhibitions while at the same time allowing for creativity that a drunken stupor could never do. The inability to orgasm is a benefit as well, at least for someone like me who struggles against orgasm every minute of straight sex.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you 2C-B, shrooms, acid people get your dicks hard. I never could. I function fine on MDMA or ketamine. My girl says Ketamine is the best.

But i hate sex on meth. maybe it&#039;s different for straight people. But i find the whole sex on meth thing a waste of energy and time. when i&#039;ve tried playing like that, all i had to show for it was a raw dick. yes, psychologically there is something to be said for having your inhibitions lowered. but the cost is too high in terms of hiv transmission, and also it creates an unrealistic expectation how sex should be., some guys i know can only have sex on meth. i think that is sad
