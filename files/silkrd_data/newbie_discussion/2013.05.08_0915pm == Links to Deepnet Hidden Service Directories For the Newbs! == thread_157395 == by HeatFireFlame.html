It is all too common on the deepweb. Most of these sick fucks think they are 100% anonymous so they just talk about it openly, forums everything, How to avoid getting caught and beat the polygraph and shit! I was shocked, I mean really shocked how common place it was. Im surprised a lot of black hat groups dont take them down and post their i.p&#039;s / personal info for everyone to see. There is even sympathizers that want to see it not legalized to do, but possession of the material legalized! I mean seriously, if raping kids is there thing, they need to take a dive into an empty pool. sick fucks. <br /><br />really, what was the party&#039;s name? If you go onto wikileaks (link here -- http://wikileaks.ch/&nbsp; if it doesn&#039;t work you should find a mirror easily enough) they release all the BNP party and supporter&#039;s names and addresses. You should find the same for them somewhere on the deepnet. Then use this guide&nbsp; &nbsp; (&nbsp; &nbsp;http://fkyvwpu7ccsorke2.onion/sets/-MakeshiftArsenal/&nbsp; &nbsp;)&nbsp; And send the fuckers a nice bomb each.&nbsp; That link is invaluable.

				in almost all EU countries it is illegal or very difficult. If you have a criminal record of any kind you cannot even join a <br />shooting club let alone own a gun legally. So the black market would be an option. But I though are you dont know where that gun has been or what is was done with it. I it was used in a murder or some thing like that and you get caught with it. You get double trouble. Having an illegal fire arm and you maybe linked to the crime. Correct me if I am wrong

				Well shit I&#039;ll give you a +1 but I&#039;ve robbed my fair share of folks and I&#039;ll be the first to admit things would have went sideways If they would have been more prepared for the situation...You also have to keep In mind most armed robbers/Burglars have no Intention whatsoever to pull the trigger. At least 70% of em are actually decent people who are doing It to feed there families because our fucked goverment doesn&#039;t give us to many options, next to a minimum wage job for the next 50+ years. Basically I&#039;m saying I agree with being able to defend yourself and your family 100%, but I disagree with the fact alot of people that own guns get way to fuckin cocky/ trigger happy when they see an intruder and may end up shooting an unarmed 13 yr old kid who thinks that by robbing you he may be able to provide a better life for his family.<br /><br />There&#039;s 2 sides to every story...

				Yes if the government does not care for its citizens it bad. <br />Sound like it would be a better idea if also do poor people would band together. Save some many buy weapons.<br />And star a revolution. Have happend before. France, Russian Empire, China look even now in Syria. The state should be there for the people not the other way around. So what are all you Americans waiting for. You all have guns so that aspect is covert. Just march to the white house damned change the French way with a loaded gun.

				Concerning the illicit devils producing CP, and regarding the proposed solutions....<br /><br />Jesus said &quot;It were better for one of them, to have a milestone tied around their neck, and for them to be tossed into the deepest ocean, than to offend one of my little ones!&quot;<br /><br />You think your mad about this, well Jesus is pissed!&nbsp; &nbsp;To take these guys out would to do them a favor, for God said it was better for them to be executed, than to continue in that kind of sin.&nbsp; Hitler killed millions of people, but in hell, lower than He are they who offend &quot;these little ones&quot;<br /><br />Someone involved in CP, needs to repent biiiiiiig time, and if I were then I would be terrified and scared of God right now, because God, who is full of mercy and forgiveness, says its better to just kill you than let you go on one more day doing what you do.&nbsp; And thats New Testament stuff talking, thats not Old Testament &#039;live by the law, die by the law&#039;.&nbsp; That is New Testament, where every other line speaks of Gods mercy, and forgiveness, yet here, Jesus says child offenders should drop dead. <br /><br />Some scribes and pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to Jesus, and said, what shall we do with her, the law says we should kill her for such a sin...but what do ye say?<br /><br />Jesus said &quot;He without sin, cast the first stone&quot;&nbsp; Eventually her accusers, being convicted of their own wrong doing, leave.<br /><br />Jesus says to the women, &quot;Where are thine accusers&quot;, She says &quot;Gone...Lord&quot;<br /><br />Jesus replies, &quot;Neither do I accuse you, go your way, and sin no more&quot;...<br /><br /><br />So in this parable, Jesus shows mercy on a women involved in sexual sin, but concerning children, Jesus said &quot;Its better to tie a rock round their necks and drown em!&quot;<br /><br />Jesus had no pity on people offending his children, this goes for:<br />* Child molesters, CP producers<br />* False teachery to children anywhere (evolution, things that turn kids away from God)<br />* Hurting children in any way.<br /><br />God sees what you do, he knows what you&#039;re thinking, so you better not mess with His kids, anyone, anywhere...if someone with a gun don&#039;t get to you first, God will definitely GET YOU!

Really? I haven run into any child porn but if i did the images would probably haunt me for a long time to come. Not everyone has a legitimate interest in everything, like you say you do. <br /><br />My own defence mechanisms psychologically can&#039;t handle shit like child porn. It makes my skin crawl and get me genuinely disturbed to see stuff like that or Budd Dwyers suicide and torture (child porn and torture isn that far apart in my book). It would however not be astounding to me if i clicked on an anonymous tor-link and being exposed to child porn, beheadings etc. It comes with the territory of being here but browsing unknown places doesnt make me a closet cp-user i hope. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I agree if your not going to pull the trigger dont ever point a gun at someone. <br /><br />As for the UK arms site, i cant personally couch for it, But sites sellign weapons are hard to verify because they usually set up shop, Sell a few and move .onion. I know you cand find a few legit one but it&#039;s hard to do. Look on BMR for a reputable vendor , most of the people on there have 0 feedback so it would be stupid to buy an ar15 from them haha.

I chose something else as a preliminary. But Krav Maga is the only form of self defense that seems realistic enough to actually be of any assistance to you in hostile situation. The problem with form fighting is that you don&#039;t have time to do ballet when someone is up closer and faster than your training will allow for. Limb locks are essential but it is frustrating when your dojo teacher says he was attacked all at once and all his training could not save him as it &quot;happened to fast&quot;. <br /><br />Where was I? Is it any good? Would you say it is better than traditional or form fighting? It;s catching on pretty quick over here. A lot are going for MMA stuff these days. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

This is the problem with the deepnet, Im telling you newbs, There is hidden news channels that report the news that the mainstream channels like NBC CNN and the BBC dont report, There&#039;s sites dedicated to cannibals, Mutilation, Rape, Murder CP and probably everything else sick you could think of And you cant really clean it up. Mod&#039;s could but they usually dont, Alongside that hackers could but they only do sometimes. And just FYI i have seen anonymous mentioned a thousand times already lmao, A lot of other hacker groups hate them for being so publicity hunting. Go browse a few other blackhat websites and you&#039;ll see some info on it all. You&#039;ll see loads of shit on the deepnet, Lots of shit. Just be careful what you click on it&#039;s about all you can do unless you have some major programming and computer skills.

If this species were to wake up to its circumstances and begin to be reasonable, we could make it so situations like this simply will not exist. There may always be psychopaths and sociopaths among us, but we can likely mitigate the destructive behaviors if we can identify them and enrich them during cognitive development. The ones that still act destructively we would then simply institutionalize.<br /><br />The crux of the problem here lies in the fact that homo sapiens is still constantly tricked by its own cleverness, and we are resultingly a highly intelligent but stupidly acting species. All human behavior is causal, and belief is one of the strongest motivators of human behavior. As long as we continue to believe ridiculous things, we will never even be able to begin solving problems like pedophilia.

The thing about BMR is they still sell weapons, So if you have a reputable vendor selling them it is a bonus, instead of buying them from a deepnet directory that you may or may not be able to trust. <br />Sr in my opinion for drugs and the rest though. Hands down. have you been to BMR yet?

The thing about weapons is, if the weapon was used for a murder in a different country and you haven&#039;t been to that country then it would be hard to pin on you. But importing firearms wouldn&#039;t be. <br /><br />I have seen sites with only text on them.

Without this, most would just lose interest.<br /><br />You have a belief system too, just like those of us that desire to retain a religious belief. Blindly dismissing them as fairytails that are the root of all evil, is just as extreme as the opposite to science. Belief systems are what give morals - and the extremes on either side of the coin have generated equally terrible evils. Scientists are not all good.<br /><br />The ability for the human mind to take things to extremes, is its achilles heel, not religion in and of itself. It is our inability to some times moderate ourselves, whether its in dogma, drugs, or worse, that truly causes problems. It is the human flaw. That same flaw, is the mother of all invention. So, personally, I would prefer to stay away from Orwellian societies. Equilibrium, Farenheit 451, The Giver, 1984... the message in these stories was always quite clear, and it was there that symbolism was used to remind us that it is in our own desire to be different that makes us all so special.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I Jewish law and Islam law and in part Christian law is based on Revelation is this not so?<br />The existence of the of God is based on rational prove. That a design need a designer even the Greeks came to that conclusion. <br /><br />PS I have a Jewish heritage and according to the law of return could get Israeli citizinship<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jewish law predates the writing of Revelations by at least a millennium - I say at least because before the Egyptians there isn&#039;t really a lot of information on what was or wasn&#039;t that is truly credible for a religious estimation. Cameron (yes, of Titanic and Alien fame) has contributed a LOT to this, and has taken quite a bit of an interest in discovering just how far the Hebrews reach - and in some places has actually found something of early Hebrew writing dating to around the time of the first pyramids being built (ie, prior to where &quot;Exodus&quot; essentially begins).<br /><br />Revelations is a christian creation, which in regards to Islam does predate the foundation of Islam - at least in a historical sense. The basis of law on revelations, at least from my interpretation and discussions with friends and colleagues in the faith, doesn&#039;t hold much towards the definition and basis of followed diction. Personally, I&#039;ve tended to classify revelations into a very touchy subject... as it conveys a feared sense to me, the &quot;Or else&quot; that religious fanatics tend to apply towards all decisions. Revelations talks primarily on Christian beliefs, and it does apply some Judaic religious notions, but a good portion of it is almost entirely Christian in nature. To be clear on at least one point, as an example, Hell in the Judaic tradition is very different from that of the Christian tradition. It doesn&#039;t exist but for very, very, very, VERY specific purposes, as in those who commit the most mortal of all sins, some of which are not even really described in either law or religious dogma. Sin in Judaism takes a very different role, as does death, birth, and moral consequence.<br /><br />When I say that, from the side of Jewish law - particularly in the example of Kosher law that I gave, that there was rationality given to the idea that the laws as stated prevented death from common disease of the time and this prevention was believed in portion to be an act of saving by a higher power - this is what happens naturally in the lack of firm understanding of why things happen. They didn&#039;t understand that pork requires very specific handling, refrigeration, care. They didn&#039;t understand that shellfish caused things like red tide, due to factors that are observable before consumption. Salmonella, didn&#039;t exist: it was an affliction that was not understood, and therefor it gained a magical existence. This is not unusual nor is it something strictly limited to the past, even today we label things that we do not understand as supernatural. Even with all of our science, all of our mathematics and physics, there is no explanation for why the past decade has been wrought with non-weather natural disasters that have killed hundreds of thousands of people. Many of those affected, have built belief systems around even these catastrophic chains of events. Look at the apocalyptic beliefs leading up to the end of December revolving around Mayan calendars. It is our minds that create these beliefs, in order to allow for the unexplainable to be realistic in our own eyes. It wasn&#039;t so long ago that technology like a camera, was believed to steal a part of your soul.<br /><br />This is not a construct of a religion, it is the construct that made religion. Without that same construct, Galileo would not have questioned that everything revolved around the Earth. Without that same construct, Columbus wouldn&#039;t have doubted the Earth was square. Unfortunately its also that same construct that leads most to believe eventually we&#039;ll all nuke ourselves to oblivion. Oh well, c&#039;est la vie. Least I&#039;ll go out with a bang&nbsp; 8)

				Hi all, just thought i would post this link for you all, It&#039;s from the hackBB wiki which i posted the link for previously but it&#039;s a really good post on anonymity and Cryptography that explains the two properly and helps you to become anonymous online. <br /><br />http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/wiki/index.php/Security_Basics

				I would add another very useful link to your directory : http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/polyfront.html<br />Polyfront seems to be the website where most of the info on the wiki comes from. It&#039;s way more useful than the wiki though (except for SR specific things, it&#039;s not about SR) and should be read by every newbie. It covers a lot of aspects on security such as PGP, TOR, and also how to ship drugs, receive drugs in the mail, etc.<br /><br />Credit goes to pine, I got the link from her.

What about the human rights of the people they will blow up? And are still planning to. <br />Bullshit. absolute bullshit.

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages. I pointed out that their Site was the same as &#039;Executive Outcomes&#039; (EO) and they posted a disclaimer that they had nothing to do with them immediately.<br />&nbsp;<br />They said a tracking number would be provided in 7-12 days- so they have around a week and half to prove this. But I am not hopeful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also wrote to Executive Outcomes- and only got this in reply- &quot;Thanks another scam&quot;. They are identical to AD, just look jazzier.<br />&nbsp;<br />For example, just look at the spelling mistake on both sites: http://imwvq3drst5zens6.onion/index.php ... er=product on EO and on http://2ousn6z3qfxvcv7t.onion/ArmsDepot ... oductID=84 on AD. It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites??? Smells very fishy to me.<br />Luckily I placed a very small order on AD I could afford to lose. Losing money is losing money- but the lesson is worth it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bests<br />Shenobie

It is all too common on the deepweb. Most of these sick fucks think they are 100% anonymous so they just talk about it openly, forums everything, How to avoid getting caught and beat the polygraph and shit! I was shocked, I mean really shocked how common place it was. Im surprised a lot of black hat groups dont take them down and post their i.p&#039;s / personal info for everyone to see. There is even sympathizers that want to see it not legalized to do, but possession of the material legalized! I mean seriously, if raping kids is there thing, they need to take a dive into an empty pool. sick fucks. <br /><br />really, what was the party&#039;s name? If you go onto wikileaks (link here -- http://wikileaks.ch/&nbsp; if it doesn&#039;t work you should find a mirror easily enough) they release all the BNP party and supporter&#039;s names and addresses. You should find the same for them somewhere on the deepnet.

You see the way Sr is like a community ? people who do carding are sort of similar, However it&#039;s not as open and public as Sr. Do you know how to Use IRC? There wil usually be some people floating around on the right channels that know what they are doing . Try some searches on &quot;basic carding&quot; Carding for begginers &quot; And try openly asking people for help, some will shun you, but some will give you advice , How we all learn. I think Totse2 has a decent begginers guide, it is clearnet, But will give you a basic idea of things, Seriously though just search for the basics on Tor, Startpage. <br />I take it you know about track1 and track 2 etc, there are many more tracks but 1&amp;2 are the most common, there are basic guides that explain exactly what they are all about. You know about dumps+pin? never ever would somebody sell Dumps+pin so when you see them it is USUALLY a scam. I had some really decent guides on a usb somewhere...... If you PM me il send you a few accross when i get a chance. <br /><br />The one decent vendor that is always reliable that i know is Matticks over on BMR and hackBB Verified. Trust me, ask about on those sites first, some of the guys have a wealth of knowledge.

I was so shocked my first reaction was to look for a complain button , then i remembered it was the deepweb and there wouldent be one. Not again since then, Now its just onto the clearweb and type &quot;category tube&quot; into google and get my selection hahaha. <br />You get torchan as well as 4chan, Neither are very useful unless you want pizzas sent to someone repeatedly Lmfao

So if anyone Is looking to purchase anything I will be willing to work with them no problems at all. I have no issues walking you through anything your having problems with either. <br />Store is open now, Will be selling in a week. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s cool you finally opened your vendor account! What&#039;s its name? It doesn&#039;t seem to be HeatFireFlame...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I was making sure I had everything I needed first. <br />The vendor name is different. I am not publicly advertising it, As I have Once had things delivered to an address of a family member, and any ties to me would not be usefull at all. Its quite a pain, However, I do not see any alternative. I shall PM certain people my vendor name. :) Cheers Tree
