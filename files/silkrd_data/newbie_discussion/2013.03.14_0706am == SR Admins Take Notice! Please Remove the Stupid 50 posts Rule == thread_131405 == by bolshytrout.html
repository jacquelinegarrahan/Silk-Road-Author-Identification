				Dear SR not to be able to participate in all forums because you have not yet posted 50 messages is truly a stupid and bureaucratic rule basically censoring new users. Especially as it is an afterthought. You have added this rule recently after many new users such as myself had unlimited access to everything for many months. And unlike even the worst afterthoughts by the most ridiculous dictators it is a rule which applies retrospectively. So someone like me who had access to everything 9 months ago has suddenly been blocked even from threads I had created myself.<br /><br />It is so stupid because it means if you dont even spend a cent on SR but post 50 messages in 5 minutes with a simple lol as content then you become a recognized member but if you make 100s of purchases but only write when necessary the same process may take you couple of years! So please do the hounorable thing and remove this limitation.

				I took a hiatus for a few months and I come back and now I can only post here even though I have been a vendor with a great rating for over a year, so I am opposed to the 50 post rule also. I never found 50 reasons to post anything before. Not to mention everytime you post anything every ass and their mother talk a bunch of shit to you in reply. The forums can be very thankless.

				I agree with abolishing the rule, as I have been a member for almost a year, took a hiatus and now have to resort to spamming to reach 50 posts.&nbsp; I have contributed to the main boards in the past but I am just not involved enough to reach 50 posts as I do not have something to contribute to every thread that I read.&nbsp; The 50 posts rule encourages spam as all new users now have to spam to get their voices heard.&nbsp; I could maybe agree with having 50 posts to not start new threads on the main boards, but to not even be able to reply to threads is ridiculous in my opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I am ignorant, but there must be other ways to deal with the spam bots.

				It takes quite a bit of time to write 50 intelligent posts, I could have been here for a couple of years and not reached 50 at the rate I was posting in the past.&nbsp; The Tor network is slow and it takes time to post, I don&#039;t have hours to sit down at these forums, but I would like to post reviews, ask questions, or contribute to threads I have some knowledge about on the main forums.&nbsp; I think that there must be a better way to control them than requiring 50 posts, which encourages spam in my opinion.

				I understand the need for the 50 post rule, but wouldn&#039;t 25 or 30 serve the same purpose? Forum moderators are not simply decreasing scams they are letting scammers set the tone of the forum. <br /><br />As it takes above average intelligence to manage a forum, couldn&#039;t capable minded people set up a different, equally or even more effective system to minimize scamming. How about 20 posts required and a warning sign that pops up every time a person replies to a a possible scam posting that reads... YOU ARE AN IDIOT OF YOU SEND MONEY TO STRANGERS! USE THE FOLLOWING WEBSITES TO BUY AND SELL.../<br /><br />Maybe software that looks for key words that potential scammers use to draw people in and requires those posts to be looked over by a human and decide if they can be posted. That would likely be too time consuming. Some websites tha accept messages vie forms on one of their pages will void the message if it sees &quot;bad&quot; language.<br /><br />How about having only one specific section where people can post these types of messages and one has to have 30+ posts to access that thread. Warn all members that any posts outsied that thread discussing this topic is likely a scam and will be deleted..<br /><br />I know that my 3 different ideas are not flawless but it only took me 5 minutes to come up with a few ideas. All I&#039;m saying is that capable people can brainstorm, think outside the box and come up with a better system. As a community we should flush this idea out. I&#039;m not a computer wiz but i program DOS and HTML and have several certifications. Computers do what we tell them them to do so why not tell them to look out for potential scammers.<br /><br />Anyway, food for thought! Good luck!!

Why do want to reach 50 posts and be able to post in the main forum if you have nothing to say ? In fact I don&#039;t understand why this is so important for you to post in the &quot;main forum&quot;, newbie thread is actually a part of the main forum. <br /><br />I believe this rule is here to stay, so it would be more constructive to stop moaning about this rule and to start something nice in the newbie section.<br /><br />WL

				This rule has already cost this forum one good contribution from me. 50 posts is insanely high, I wouldn&#039;t even know what to post about. How about a system where you can buy yourself out of this bullshit by buying a listing on SR and giving your forum name? I would pay up to 1BTC for that right new, a spammer would most probably not, because the risk of being banned quickly is high.

				Any forum I have ever joined i got to the minimum post pretty quickly as I&#039;m overly sociable. I do appreciate that some people dont have much to contribute or its just not their style. On this forum I haven&#039;t needed to ask much so after 6 months I have few posts.<br /><br />Maybe I made my point earlier and some people have raised the topic as well... spammers are partially setting the tone and effectiveness of this forum. There is likely a better way to deal with con-men. Maybe the moderators have thought all this through and literally decided the 50 post rule is the best way to handle this. If that is the case, so be it but I think an open dialogue is not necessarily bitching and might end up improving things. Open dialogue is most often the best way to handle any situation.<br /><br />Help us Obi Wan Kenobi,your our only hope!

				The spammers have already achieved their goal when only 1 post reaches the other forums, despite it being harder. There need to be more moderators, or a better captcha (the current one is really bad, I know because I can write a program solve it), or maybe even auto-ban accounts that post multiple messages with a low Levenshtein distance. Another thing that might work is to disallow posting links by default.

				Done. This is one of the more stupid things I ever did. If I used my time for writing code instead of posting useless crap I could have earned ~1 BTC. I would have gladly spent that BTC to verify my account. But no, fuck you LegOfNarch, you could be a spammer, so we need you to spam the forum to prove you&#039;re no spammer.

				I tried to start off by not spamming at all, but the only people in here really are people spamming to get their 50 post count. After 10 constructive posts, I decided it wasn&#039;t worth doing. To be honest, it is like a test in order to get in to the real community as it takes almost an hour to do enough spamming due to tor being so slow.

				I like the rule and hope it stays. Makes it just that bit harder for LE to post in the real threads, or for vendors to post fake reviews, or for general trolls. If someone wants to be a dick now at least they have to put in some time first. And the spams contained at least.

				I just discovered this rule, also. I&#039;m new to the road but have already purchased nearly $1,000 worth of merch in 2 weeks, but I can&#039;t even post on the board really.. Sucks. I found this out when I was trying to post in the request forum and couldn&#039;t find for the life of me the new topic button. I thought I was blind. Oh well. All I wanted to know was why SR seems to have a lack of barbiturates. I love sampling different drugs and i&#039;d really love to get my hands on something other than pheno to try. Anyone have any idea where tuinal or others such as this are available? I know they still produce them in certain countries, but here in the US, it&#039;s really dry.

				The main reason I think it is silly is that I had a previous account on here before I made my vendor account and this rule was not in place but it was a great for newbies to the site to ask questions and they would actually get intelligent, correct responses from a lot of the more &quot;senior members/vendors&quot; Now, this whole section is just pure spam, there is no constructive threads or questions here so why would anyone want to come to this section unless they needed to get 50 posts it is a complete waste of server space. Even me as a vendor must get 50 posts before I can post elsewhere and this slows down things for me....I really see no upside to this rule. It does nothing to keep leo out and is a simple waste of server space.

				I don&#039;t think the rule is anything bad. Even if you can only post in the newbie section until 50. You don&#039;t need to spam just to get to 50. If you intelligent and want to add to a real discussion, just do so.
