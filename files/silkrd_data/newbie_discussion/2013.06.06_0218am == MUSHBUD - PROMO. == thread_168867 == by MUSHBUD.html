				Hey SR.<br /><br />Last week when the SR Forums where down, I ran a promotion on reddit.com.&nbsp; I&#039;m finding out from some customers that their shrooms were inactive.&nbsp; It appears that the first few dozen samples I sent out are effected.&nbsp; My newer samples however are being reported as strong, and I have personally tested my latest batch on Sunday and they were good.&nbsp; You can search MUSHBUD on reddit for more info.&nbsp; I will include the links to both important posts:<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1fftee/mushbud_feedback/<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1f1p3v/nearly_free_10gram_samples_from_mushbud_promo_on/<br /><br />Here is a re-post of what I wrote To Reddit:<br /><br />Hey Reddit.<br /><br />I want for you all to have a good time on my shrooms. I started this promotion with the best intents, to create positive vibes for my name. Having people call my shrooms bunk is the worst case scenario for me, and is upsetting to say the least. I now have this black eye emerging that I need to address.<br /><br />There is a chance that if you were one of my very earliest receivers, that you may have received a package that was prepared too early in avdvance and that it had lost it&#039;s potency due to being ground and more suseptable to oxidization. I blame it on myself not Vacuum sealing these bags as quickly as I should have. I had created a number of bags to test my technique, to judge my creation times and get an overall sense of things before I began to offer publicly.<br /><br />If you sincerely feel that you received a non active package, if you followed the empty stomach rule (3+ hours since eating), and you still got nothing. I am prepared to send you another sample from a batch that I myself have tested This past Sunday morning.<br /><br />I did a wake and bake with nothing but a coffee in my stomach and 2grams. I tripped on my couch for 4 hours wondering how people could call it bunk, and concluded it must have been from sitting in an unproperly packaged state. That&#039;s all I can come up with.<br /><br />I have been making these packages fresh ground since these initial first offering. This is the reason for my processing taking longer then expected, and why I removed my listing until I caught up. I expect that these fresh ground samples are as active as what I tested Sunday.<br /><br />It is not my intent to deceive you, and I wold definitely not send you anything that isn&#039;t 100% Mushroom. The mush I used for the earliest packs were my typical, Deep blue bruising PE, I had made assumptions that they would be just as strong as any other mushroom I&#039;ve ever sold.<br /><br />Please though, I open a can of worms here, and now anyone that wants to take advantage of me could. Please only make a request if you in fact did received one of these early bags. If the mushrooms -are- active, please be satisfied with them and do not try and take advantage of a second free pack... I am not a rich person. I&#039;m trying to make this work too.<br />

				Some friends and I took these over the weekend. I never weighed the bag, but assuming it was 10 grams, I took a gram. Everyone else took between 1 and 2.5 grams. We all had a blast, we even had a first timer who had the time of her life. We were all already pretty drunk when we took them, and they kicked in within a half an hour for me and lasted about 3 hours. The aftereffects were felt for another 2 or 3 hours. I fell peacefully asleep after about 6 or 7 hours. No real visuals other than a bit of waviness, but at 1 gram while drunk, it was exactly what I wanted to achieve. <br /><br />I believe my order was placed a couple days into the promotion, so mine may have been of the latter batch. All around good experience, no complaints here. Would definitely order again. <br /><br />

				Hey Mushbud.<br /><br />I believe I may have gotten one of the weak batches. I was one of the very first to buy from you, and the package came pretty fast which was great, but when I took them&nbsp; I ate 5 grams, waited an hour and only felt it slightly, then took the remaining 5 grams. Over the next few hours I had what I would describe as a mild trip. I definitely was tripping, but not very hard, especially for 10 grams. At the time I attributed this to having a cross tolerance from the LSD I had taken just over a week earlier (even though I was sure that taking 10 grams would definitely compensate), but upon reading this post, it is possible that I received one of the ones that you are describing.<br /><br />It sucks about my trip, but is my understanding that you lost a bit of money with the bitcoin value dropping, so I&#039;m not going to ask you to send me another one for free. I appreciate the work that you are doing, and it&#039;s awesome that you are allowing people to have the psilocybin experience for such a cheap price. Once you restock, I will definitely give your stuff another try. Keep up the good work!

				I&#039;d like to do a quick review for MushBuds Penis Envy Shrooms that he was selling dirt cheap<br /><br />Delivery 5/5 - 9 days from Canada to UK<br />Stealth 2/5 - Double VacPac&#039;d. No giveaways from the outside of package but you&#039;d find them instantly upon opening. Not ideal for anybody with particularly intrusive parents/partners/housemates.<br />Communication ?/5 - No need for it so cannot comment.<br />Product 5/5 - Myself and four friends took 2g each, gulped down with OJ, at approx 5.30PM. I hadn&#039;t eaten all day bar a Big Mac Meal 3 hours prior to ingestion. Cant give exact timings as I prefer not to concentrate on the time whilst tripping and allow things to go where they wish at their own pace and, obviously, estimating the timings is pretty useless when you cant really grasp it lol but I went to bed around 11.00PM with mild CEV. In-between 5.30PM and 11PM I had one of the best trips I&#039;ve experienced. The come up was slow but was characterized by a slow build in energy, huge urge to talk, fading of concentration, CEV&#039;s and very slight visual distortions. When at the peak I was experiencing OEVs which manifested as kaleidoscopic patterns in the sky, pulsing and swirling and fracturing in tie with the music. I also &#039;saw&#039; a flock of birds performing the most amazing and intricate acrobatics and aerial maneuvers which set off a long, deep and interesting chain of thought on freedom, perspectives, fun and generally how much i envied them. I also had a huge affinity with the park we were sitting in and nature in general, &quot;I don&#039;t want to leave the park because it&#039;s as beautiful as I feel&quot; - my feelings at the time. We left the park during the peak for my mates house which was a good shout in the end as its full of mad shit to look at and got a really nice ye olde feel. OEV&#039;s continued whilst at his house and continued to manifest as kaleidoscopic patterns but very noticeable distortions&nbsp; on reality where also quite prominent as well as intricate and complex patterns of thought. as we started coming down the others ordered a chinese takeaway. I stayed in the garden for another hour listening to Bob Marley alone and have never had emotions invoked so strongly from listening to music as i did then. I could feel every tear he sang about roll down my face, every ounce of heartache crush my spirits, every ray of joy lifting them back up. <br /><br />Overall a delightful and lasting experience. Will up the dose to 2.5-3g next time.... Hopefully delve a bit deeper into my mind :)<br /><br />SELLER IS LEGIT AND PRODUCT IS LEGIT. NO FE FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS. ORDER WITHOUT FEAR!<br /><br />Thanks for a top product MushBud,<br /><br />
