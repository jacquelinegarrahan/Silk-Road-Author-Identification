				I&#039;ve bought one 200microgramm Hofman blotter from this vendor, it was my 1st purchase on SR and i was not asked to FE. I&#039;m going to have it next week, when i&#039;m on holiday. My questions are- 1. Has anyone tried this vendor&#039;s acid, how is it?<br />2. How much to eat? ( i last time had it 15 years ago, after that 15 years of opiate system, now on subutex treatment)

				By eat, are we referring to the old, between lip and gum? I&#039;ve never known if LSD can be swallowed, and if that works.&nbsp; Any ideas folks? Last time I had it I held it in my mouth until the effects kicked in.....6 hours later! Madness! Why acid takes so long is a mystery. Maybe it was the acid I used to get. Mushrooms always only took around 40 mins. I miss mushrooms. Does OP smoke weed, have you taken mushrooms in the past?

LSD shouldn&#039;t take more than than an hour or so to come up. 25i takes significantly longer (3-5 hrs usually)<br />This seems to happen A LOT these days. I&#039;m getting so annoyed with all these 25i tabs going around on the streets being sold as LSD. ITS NOT THE SAME! I like when dealers know their shit and don&#039;t try to push RC&#039;s on me as &quot;bombass fry&quot;

				Hello new vendor. Unfortunately, I live in the good old UK, which you don&#039;t deliver to. Have you used the product offers threads to let people know you&#039;re new, and tell them your good intentions? Masterkiev, my trips were taking 6 hours for me to come up from over 10 years ago, I believe 25i wasn&#039;t discovered. It was acid, I&#039;ve done NBOMe&#039;s recently, there&#039;s a big difference, I couldn&#039;t get confused. Perhaps it was me keeping it between my gum and my lip, instead of eating it, but I was told to do it the way I did. I shall buy some more sometime and experiment further. I wish magic mushrooms were still legal, I would pick them up for about Â£5 for 8g in Manchester, or at Leeds festival. The Monday after the festival when they were to become illegal was fantastic. Vendors who had tons of stock were having to sell them off cheap. Oh, what lovely times were had!

				Hi, peeps!<br />i had it some days ago, it wasn&#039;t that potent for me due to being on subutex (i&#039;ve heard subs dull the effects of lsd),- i now oredered more from jesusofrave, because fredthebakers listings don&#039;t seem to be active anymore and going to eat 3,- but theses ones are 110 microgramm

				Hey there poison, we have to stop meeting like this... Let us know how the JOR tabs turn out as I&#039;m debating on which to try, or whether to order mushrooms, or grow them myself maybe.
