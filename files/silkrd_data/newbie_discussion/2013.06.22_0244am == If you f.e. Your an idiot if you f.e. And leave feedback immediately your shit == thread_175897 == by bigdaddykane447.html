				Just cause you finalize early doesn&#039;t mean you have to leave feedback or you lose your chance to.&nbsp; leave your feedback after you receive your order and test it!<br /><br />I&#039;m so fucking sick of clicking on an ad and every review is &quot;f.e&quot; how the fuck does that help anyone out?&nbsp; even worse is &quot;will update&quot; you forgot the &quot;never&quot; in between asshole!<br /><br />Bottom line after you finalize you will have the opportunity to leave feedback indefinitely, so what till you get the box then write words that describe your experience.<br /><br />P.s. Your really stupid for finalizing early

				I think this really disillusions new buyers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking around the forums for a while, following all my SR sista&#039;s but I have to say some vendors WILL ask for FE.<br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t automatically be Sus of a Vendor who asks for FE. If you are a new buyer with no/low buying stats 9/10 vendors will ask you for FE. If you have a high refund and/or autofinalize rate (FOR WHATEVER REASON) 7/10 vendors will ask you to FE. Some vendors like FartBombers discount shop is 100% always FE because the prices they offer are so low and BitCoin fluctuation is crazy.<br /><br />Please guys research the vendor and ask them questions about why they want FE. Some will even give you some bonuses for FE<br /><br />DON&#039;T FE for vendors younger than 1 month with less than 35 transactions NO MATTER WHAT (they shouldn&#039;t even be asking, it&#039;s against the rules, simply click &#039;report vendor&#039;) and DON&#039;T FE for Domestic orders, NO MATTER WHAT.<br /><br />And as bigdaddykane says, please don&#039;t leave feedback which says &quot;fe&quot; or &quot;fe will update later&quot; especially if you don&#039;t know how to update later or forget. After finalizing simply click on the SR camel or anywhere else and go out of the feedback page. You will still be able to leave feedback afterwards when your order actually arrives!<br /><br />TL;DR Research and ask questions about FE for international vendors. Don&#039;t FE for domestic or new vendors. Don&#039;t leave feedback with &quot;fe&quot; or &quot;fe will update&quot; if you never intend to update.
