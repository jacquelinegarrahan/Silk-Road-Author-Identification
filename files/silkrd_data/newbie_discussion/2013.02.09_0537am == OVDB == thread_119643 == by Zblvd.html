				So I guess this is the only I can post on... Anyways, it&#039;s been a very long time since I&#039;ve logged on here. I was one of the first group of members on silk road and it is absolutely amazing to see that this marketplace is still striving.&nbsp; I just wanted know a few things. When I first found tor I dealt with maxxvendor and I quickly learned that he was in over his head with orders and I ended up losing a good amount of money.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering does anyone know where that guy went? Also, I see that OVDB no longer exists.&nbsp; What ever happened to that place?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				Hey, glad to see a veteran make a come back :) I&#039;m sure SR looks different from when you last remember it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not familiar with the name maxxvendor, what did he deal in? What does OVDB stand for?

				OVDB (Open Vendor Data Base) - IIRC it was closed by the people who ran it because they did not want to continue taking the risk. There is a forum on here for discussions about the OVDB.

				The server that hosted OVDB got rebooted and admin was away. It was using full disk encryption so it had to be booted manually. At that point admin was busy / away or something and had already been having thoughts of shutting it down. Basically he just let it go. This was November of 2011 or so. Some of the old OVDB members came to SR forum which is why there&#039;s a subforum for that now (look all the way at the bottom).<br /><br />OVDB admin has been posting as kmfkewm on this forum.<br />

				Here&#039;s a repost of when he was discussing making a decentralized forum, but I guess that never happened.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7882.0<br /><br />Somebody else wanted to create a decentralized market called BitWasp, but apparently that hasn&#039;t happened yet either.<br />
