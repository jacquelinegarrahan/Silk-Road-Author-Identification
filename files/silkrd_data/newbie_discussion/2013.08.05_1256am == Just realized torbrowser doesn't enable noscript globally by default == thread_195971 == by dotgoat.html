				So with the reason news about freedomhosting getting taken down (still not clear to me the extent of this) I just played it safe and reextracted the torbrowser bundles I got off eff and I was going to install noscript.&nbsp; Turns out it&#039;s been there all along BUT it didn&#039;t have scripts globally disabled.&nbsp; So anyone using torbrowser may want to do that since at least at one point there was a js exploit on tormail designed for firefox 17 which is what torbrowser is.<br /><br />Enabling scripts globally is simple enough by clicking on the &quot;S&quot; next to url and saying disable globally.&nbsp; It&#039;s now going to probably complain a lot depending on what sites you go to. It&#039;s best to just disable those notifications by going to options &gt; notifications &gt; uncheck show message about blocked scripts.<br /><br />The problem is typically you could allow javascript on sites you trust... Well if you trusted tormail and enabled javascript you may have gotten some extra javascript.&nbsp; May just be better to go to about:config, search for javascript.enabled and double click it so it&#039;s false so it&#039;s disabled globally (there&#039;s a system preference too but they plan to remove that option in an up and coming release.<br /><br />Hope this is of use to people.

				It isn&#039;t enabled by default because it distiguishes you from other TOR users and diasables functionality of legitimate websites.<br /><br />If you need to be completely anonymous TURN IT ON.

				The only reason it distinguishes you at all is because it&#039;s not enabled by default.&nbsp; If everyone had it enabled it would be those with it disabled that stood out.

				NoScript being enabled by default isn&#039;t going to happen any time soon.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Tor FAQ</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why is NoScript configured to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle? Isn&#039;t that unsafe?<br /><br />We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in the Tor Browser Bundle because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would give up on Tor entirely if a website they want to use requires JavaScript, because they would not know how to allow a website to use JavaScript (or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />*****CLEARNET WARNING*****<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled
