				You&#039;re the reason why we can&#039;t have nice things. You can ATLEAST keep the drugs out of reach and sight of your children. However I have no answer for your question, I have no experience with valium. <br /><br />Please try to keep your kids environment safe, it&#039;d be a shame if something would happen to him by your clumsiness.

				From the Valium page on drugs.com:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Children 6 mo of age and older<br /><br />Usual daily dose PO 1 to 2.5 mg 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like he took amount that they would space out throughout the day. Taking it all at once is on the high end of recommended doses.<br /><br />Dosing recommendations are conservative and exceeding it a bit is probably safe. However I would go to the hospital, even though it is very close to the safe daily levels it was consumed more rapidely than suggested.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210866.msg1526366#msg1526366">Quote from: the chosen one on September 09, 2013, 03:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...it was about a half 10mg I managed to get the rest out<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If it was 5mg then I would just keep an eye on the kid. It is well within what a doctor will give a kid first. Keep him awake and especially do not let him sleep on his back.<br /><br />The standard unconcious/delerious dangers apply, choking on vomit, falling off of objects, trying to move around and hurting himself.<br /><br />As long as he is supervised he should be fine... (I am not a doctor)

				Here is more specific information.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Usual Pediatric Dose for Light Sedation<br /><br />Conscious sedation for procedures:<br />Oral:<br />1 to 12 years: 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg orally 45 to 60 minutes before procedure, up to a maximum of 10 mg<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you take the weight of the kid in kilograms and multiply it by .3mg then you will see the highest mg that would be used for a doctor to sedate a kid for a procedure.<br /><br />The max of 10mg would work out to a 33kg child, if you think 5mg was consumed then a 16kg child would be given that dose.<br /><br />If your kid is under 16kg then medical attention is probably a good idea. Even though overdoses of benzos are rarely fatal they are still dangerous.
