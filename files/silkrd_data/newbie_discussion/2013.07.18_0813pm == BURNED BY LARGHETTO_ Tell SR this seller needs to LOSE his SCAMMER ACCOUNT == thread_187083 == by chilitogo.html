				Below are the highlights of our current emails.&nbsp; I have read up to 15 pages back of this scammers feedback and can&#039;t believe he is still being allowed to sell on SR.&nbsp; He does this because this site is anonymous and his anonymity makes him feel safe and above recourse.&nbsp; We may all have been suckered in and FE&#039;d and you feel embarrassed and powerless, like there&#039;s nothing you can do about it... maybe not alone.&nbsp; Together though, that&#039;s different. We can each post here on this thread the end result of business with Larghetto and then request SR pull his seller account, on every sellers profile there is a&nbsp; button to click &quot;report this vendor&quot; do it!&nbsp; Even if you FE&#039;d.&nbsp; Even if SR doesn&#039;t pull his seller account this thread will cost him sales if enough people add to it.&nbsp; The feedback on his profile does not show enough at a time to make the impact it should.<br /><br />The item was sent.<br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hello,<br />Since you have the tracking numbers you should know it was never delivered, right? Please provide the tracking number because item was not received and no letter from customs either. you keep reassuring everyone that all tracking numbers will be provided and that you guarantee a reship or 100% money back.<br /><br />Hello,<br />We can&#039;t replace the old product. However, we can certainly give you a new product at a very good price.<br />We have some very very popular new products from China now just in. We also have US Domestic products also if you check our profile.<br />We will give you a very good price with these and escrow without question so you are fully protected.<br />We will also reship at least part of it in a seizure or a loss with tracking.It has an express and trackable option.<br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You are offering me a reduced price on other products, the suggestion that I spend more money with you is beyond comprehensible to me. I was given a 100% REFUND or RESHIP guarantee. So the reship is out of the question leaving only my refund in question, are you going to honor your word or not? Chilitogo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Hello,<br />There was absolutely NO indication of a refund in any term described on our profile or any listing.<br />The only one referring to a refund is our offer of a refund if our purity is not what we say it is on top of the test costs as well.<br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You are so full of shit! So you wanna play that game? You guaranteed a reship, so reship. I don&#039;t give a fuck where you get it, BUY IT FROM ANOTHER VENDOR, just honor your guarantee I&#039;m tired of fucking with you!! If you do not give me the right answer I am reporting you to SR. I am telling you right up front and that is my guarantee.<br />I just copied this off of your profile<br />**Regarding our feedback, if you look below the people who have posted 1/5 have accepted refunds and they are maliciously not leaving 5/5 as they agreed when they took the refund. They all mention the refund too!

				That sucks man, hope yu find some resolution. Just a little advice - feel free to do with it whatever you want bro :) <br />Your tone was firm but cordial in the first 2 msgs, but in your later msgs you put him on blast. This probably won&#039;t have a positive effect on your resolution. You ALWAYS catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar<br /><br />good luck on getting ur cash/ shipment - the force is with you!

				Larghetto is the only vendor I have ever gotten burned by in 15-20 trades on the road. I was new and gullible, and he just seems to be the type model of a selective scammer. <br />I finalized early (stupid as I was), I had received a decent shipment from him once before. Nothing arrived, and he just ended up suggesting that I could get a 20% refund if I altered my review back from 1/5 (as rightly deserved) to 5/5. No way I&#039;m going to help that weasel pump his stats for a measly compensation for wares he never sent. Took the loss, learned the lesson, left him the feedback he reserved. He should be banished to help increase the trust and integrity in this market.

				So I had an order from a user from the name Larghetto, he had purchased 1oz crystal meth and I typically dont even ship to new buyers INTL but required him to FE &amp; he did so in which I shipped to:<br /><br />bf2c7***** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1oz (28g) HIGH QUALITY CRYSTAL METHAMPHETAMINE!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEXT DAY AIR WHEN APPLICABLE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Please dispatch to the same kind of quality as chaletla would have.<br /><br />Dried out whole rocks. I don&#039;t doubt your quality though.<br /><br />Please dispatch by very fast service as I have selected the fastest option for your trouble at $100 extra. I will finalize, however I do ask for a tracking number first. You have my word.<br /><br />Any extras appreciated and as said I WILL finalize with tracking number. I am on every day almost.<br /><br />Mr M Pittas<br />Room Number 525<br />1710 Lotus Sukhumvit 50<br />Prakanong, Klongtoey, Bangkok<br />10260<br />Thailand<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larghetto(64) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41 / 9%<br /><br />He is now harassing me after receiving a very discounted oz from me because of him claiming that if I dont send him another oz free he will ruin my feedback score and I told him look you got your package I have tracking which he even admits to receiving yet he is now trying to tell me there were 3 different shards and one was different and of better quality than the others which is impossible as he got an oz which was from a new batch and I had a straight brick in one huge slab/rock in a turkey bag. I even have pictures of that days packages I packaged up 4 different ounces and one was for him it was even 2 grams over and all from the exact same batch and of same quality yet he continues to harass saying there was 3 huge rocks and 1 was the best out of the 3 and I asked for pictures and proof and he just continues to threaten my feedback.<br /><br />(Here is the pictures of high resolution packages getting ready to be packaged &amp; processed for that day which included Largetto&#039;s order out of my ONLY batch from 32 ounces) Zoom in close and see for yourself for one, the QUALITY as well as every single ounce is exactly the same batch! No difference whatsoever.. See for yourself friends:<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/6TbA.jpg<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/H5aV.jpg<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Now can anybody confirm this is the scam seller that I have read in the forums? And is this vendor in fact Larghetto reselling my product? His pictures of product are not up close and dont show the quality but after him threatening my feedback if I dont provide a free reship because my quality isnt what he normally gets and yet he is still asking me to buy another ounce after he just left me 2/5 feedback which is ridiculous that a user can threaten to give less feedback and lie and hold me somewhat hostage based on if I give him another free package as well as sell him another one for cheaper.. Who does this?? <br /><br />I am unsure if this is Larghetto reselling my product on a new account (JaysonWoods) but this discussion uses his name in the listing and when I look at the products he is selling it even says &quot;GRADE AAA Crystal Meth NorCal style - Awesome supply&quot; which is where he got the package from.<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203310.msg1463067#msg1463067<br /><br />^^This is discussion using Larghetto&#039;s name and speaking of his ban and the link to this username leads me very suspicious, especially when his ratings are 2.7/5.0 and the demeanor of his messages towards me. My statistics and feedback speak for themselves. I always provide exactly what the customer is paying for.. even a little extra!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d43470b5d0<br /><br />^^This buyer account is suspicious and looks to be reselling my product but who knows. If anyone else has had issues with Larghetto and or knows if this is the same seller that was scamming people please let me know any relevant information as to get this joker banned again.<br /><br />Thanks and its quite sad that we have people like this trying to ruin a great market for legit vendors like myself and others!

				Seeing all these horror stories about scammers definitely messes with one&#039;s confidence. Natural Highs is a vending account just opened to the public, worried about recieving unwarranted bad feedback.

				Any one that knows anything, knows larghetto is a scammer cunt. Sadly, its unlikely any of his accounts will be banned. He has been doing this, and getting away with it, for quite some time now. Sorry you got fucked man.

				Yes your telling me.. And also what the hell is this I had a 4.7/5.0 rating and he leaves me a 2/5 which if you review all my feedback I have all 5/5 not one 1/5 nor anything in-between except for Larghetto&#039;s 2/5 and now it changed my whole stats and feedback bar graph to something ridiculous and tells me im 2.7/5.0 how does his one rating bring me down all the way to there.. I&#039;m ranked in the top 35% I literally just had 4.7/5.0 and he leaves this 2/5 and my whole bar graph goes from all green on the 5 to all green on the 2.. <br /><br />What the heck is up with this new rating system its messing with vendors pages.. Ive notice vendors that there ratings say 5.0/5.0 yet they have multiple 1/5 and 3/5&#039;s how does there stats or graph not change whatsoever? Example:<br />User BTCB has a rating of 5.0/5.0 yet I scroll down his feedback and he has many 1/5 2/5 3/5&#039;s and his stats are at 5.0/5.0<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/78fbcc6b81<br /><br />My stats are as following after his 2/5 feedback:<br />Vendor stats:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />vendor for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1m 23d<br />last seen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today<br />rank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top 35%<br />avg rating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.7 / 5.0<br />transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112<br />fans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125<br /><br />Yet I look at every one of my feedback ratings and only have his 2/5 and every single other is 5/5.. how is this correct people?? Someone tell me this is a flaw in this new system or atleast tell me I&#039;m very ignorant and blind for that matter.. Just review the stats on his page and then mine and others for that matter.. His stats should show many 1/5 and others but he has 100% 5.0/5.0 despite his feedback ratings on his page.. Very boggled by this!<br /><br />BTCB INCORRECT STATS AND BAR GRAPH ERROR<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/x0KH.jpg<br /><br />If your too lazy to check his stats and mine for yourself here is the proof in the pudding..
