				I&#039;ve only started using SR and the forum recently. Is it normal for there to be a few minutes or maybe an hour ever now and again where I cant get on the site? Or it&#039;s incredibly slow? Or is this just normal for tor?

				It`s not uncommon that you can&#039;t login or that the site doesn&#039;t respond at all. Just keep calm and check every half hour or so.

				I find that generally it&#039;s better than it was a year ago once you actually get on to it.&nbsp; But in the last couple of weeks it&#039;s been ridiculously slow in logging in.&nbsp;

				The tor network is currently under a lot of stress, with the amount of tor clients increasing drastically. It&#039;s not clear why. See: (clearnet warning!) https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients

				Hi Noobs,<br /><br />Apart from all the Botnet stories utilizing TOR.<br /><br />From what we have been experiencing in the &quot;Real World&quot;, many many people who are not interested in SR at all are switching to TOR for regular browsing.<br /><br />This is simply a natural reaction to the NSA snooping becoming public to the masses.<br /><br />More TOR Relays are being created daily and an equilibrium will be reached soon.<br /><br />TBH - We have found today particularly speedy!<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Been using SR and Tor for about 2 years and it&#039;s much better than it used to be, although it does remind me of using the internet 20 years ago. If you can&#039;t bear it, sometimes reconnecting helps as you can get stuck with nodes on the network that have poor connectivity or are flakey, and make sure to keep your client up to date. The best solution though is to run your own relay that is on most of the time since it&#039;s more secure and gives you a solid connection to the network.<br /><br />Since that&#039;s not feasible for most people it&#039;s probably best just to look at it as the price you pay for a much safer way to get at the things you want.
