				Hi all first post and a review of Haizenbergs MDMA, just to say I tried this on Saturday at a festival, I took my first hit at around 5 in the evening it took about 40 mins to hit me after that it was happy days, I also reagent tested it and it turned to black immediately, I was up for 12 hours straight after this I did not measure out precise doses as I just dabbed every now and again and offered fellow festival goers dabs and friends who all also enjoyed it! I have to admit it is some of the cleanest I have done so far and will be going back for more, I am not really sure what I got up to in them 12 hours but I had a great time plus I only had 1 gram and I shared a lot of it and still came home with some left all in all I had a great experience :-)

				I&#039;m glad you had a good experience with Haizenberg but I have only been frustrated with my order from him.&nbsp; I ordered in August.&nbsp; Haizenburg sent me a message a couple of days later, asking me to FE.&nbsp; He said it would help him out because of the volatile bitcoin market.&nbsp; He assured me that my order was already in transit so it wouldn&#039;t make any difference if I didn&#039;t FE.&nbsp; Time passed and the auto finalize date was quickly approaching.&nbsp; The order had not arrived and I proposed that we extend the auto-finalize date an additional 30 days.&nbsp; This was done.&nbsp; During the passing weeks, more and more buyers began to complain.&nbsp; The LSD Avengers dropped his rating.&nbsp; Their rating of Haizenburg, at the time of purchase, was the reason I made the purchase from him.&nbsp; He began to address the complaints on Reddit and the Silk Road forums and offered free meth and promised re-ships to all.&nbsp; I messaged him and asked he would re-ship my order.&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; I am a migrant from Atlantis.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made other purchases on the Road and I&#039;m very satisfied with the vendors.&nbsp; I made subsequent orders from other vendors selling the same items as Haizenberg. Jersey Cow is a great vendor.&nbsp; I also made an order from the USA guy that sells Jersey Cow&#039;s blotters domestically.&nbsp; He was straight forward and professional.&nbsp; Anyway, after being a lurker on this forum for some time, I had to register and share my experience with Haizenberg.&nbsp; Come on Haizenberg!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a patient guy.&nbsp; How about a re-ship? Although, I would prefer a refund.&nbsp; I have documented my communication with Haizenberg.&nbsp; I wish I wasn&#039;t a newbie (to this forum) and I would post this on his review thread in rumor mill section.&nbsp; <br /><br />p.s. I didn&#039;t FE.<br />p.p.s.&nbsp; As you can see, this is why you never FE.

				That is a damn shame, and makes me worried. Some vendors I really want to buy from require FE for newbies like me. I still haven&#039;t placed my first order :(<br /><br />Also, here&#039;s the official Spam to 50 Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=180675.0<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t take long, just knock out those last 30 posts real quick. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Damn, I thought he was pretty trustworthy, so I bought some tabs from him. Did I make a mistake? Will I just have to wait for a long time to them?

				Haizenberg finally responded. Of course, he responded to my post, not my PM. He promised me a full refund.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you know if he delivers.

				I also ordered MDMA from him a month ago<br />The order took a really long time to get there (3-4 weeks in europe), but in the end it did and the product was awesome<br />If the auto finalize date is approaching and you don&#039;t want to FE, you can still take it to the resolution center and ask for a few more days, that&#039;s what I did<br />i wouldn&#039;t worry much about him not delivering, he&#039;s had personal issues lately so the delay must be normal

				Hey guys, I ordered some Hoffman blotters from Haizenberg about a month ago. Fortunately,&nbsp; he didn&#039;t ask for FE. Delivery took 13 days (within Europe), which I&#039;d say is not fast but acceptable. The stealth was perfect and I even got one extra. So overall I was very satisfied with the transaction. I think he&#039;s a pretty busy guy which results in some delays every now and then.

				Wanted to chime in with my quick review of Haizenberg:<br /><br />- Vendor Name: Haizenberg<br /><br />- MDMA &amp; LSD Blotter<br /><br />- R/R: High, 4.9 score, mixed feeback in reviews and product comments - some late-ship reported<br /><br />- Result: Eventually ordered three times from vendor:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) LSD Blotter: Asked for FE based on positive reviews, and I obliged; product arrived in 1.5 weeks from EUR, but had no drug effect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) MDMA Messaged vendor about order; without asking he sent a free blotter to me as apology; along with high grade MDMA; arrived in 2 weeks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(3) LSD Blotter: Based on positive experience, I ordered additional blotter from different brand, vendor has been communicating in process<br /><br />I have had great communication with the vendor, and he&#039;s admitted that he&#039;s been really busy with orders but that he&#039;s trying to make up for it with good communication, and on rare ocassion bonus products - - As long as he maintains that, and the quality of the product stays the same, he has me as a customer for the long term.&nbsp; I give him a true 5/5 for order process/shipping and a true 5/5 for product quality!

				I have ordered 1g of mdma on the 18th of August EU to EU. Nothing!!! I am not getting any reply from him, except for 3x8 days extensions already at the resolution centre...My coins are still in escrow and I want them back!!! How do I ask the SR admins to give it back since I&#039;ve been waiting for over 50 days?
