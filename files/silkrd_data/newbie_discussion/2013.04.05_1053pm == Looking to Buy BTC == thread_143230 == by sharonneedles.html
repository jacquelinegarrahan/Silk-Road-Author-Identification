				sharonnedles, there are way easier ways to get bitcoins than to exchange euros to pounds, then send them through the mail, etc. You should check out localbitcoins.com, it&#039;s awebsite where you can find legal bitcoin sellers near your area, you basically arrange a meeting with the person, give him the cash and he withdraws the bitcoin to your wallet from his phone in front of you (so you know you don&#039;t get ripped off). It seems like a safer way to get bitcoins than sending it to another country, especially since sending cash is pretty risky.<br /><br />For the US, just do an anonymous bank deposit. DON&#039;T use your bank account and DON&#039;T use mtgox! Just use bitfloor, it&#039;s way easier and more secure.

				Thanks for the suggestions, both of you. I&#039;m currently in France and when I try to search for sellers in my area on localbitcoins.com it doesn&#039;t show anyone in the country! Surely this is incorrect.

				Find something you can sell for bitcoins.&nbsp; You could list your Euro notes on SR and other sites that accept bitcoin.&nbsp; Or you could use the Euro notes to buy pre-paid debit/gift cards and sell the cards.&nbsp; &nbsp;That way, you don&#039;t have to pay the exchange fees.

				bitinstant.com by far is the easiest quickest method ive found you get your coins exactly 1 hour after you send the moneygram and theres only a 3.99% charge which is way lower than most one love !

And maybe Sharon doesn&#039;t want to have *that* many bitcoins! By the way Sharon, I looked and there are sellers on localbitcoins O.o maybe you didn&#039;t search right? <br /><br />&quot;clearnet warning&quot; https://localbitcoins.com/postal_code/FR/Paris/<br /><br />Bitinstant only works for US and bitfloor is way cheaper (0.5% or less) and easier.
