				from my time here on SR ive seen alot of things and learned alot of things. the way that this place is set up its almost always a leap of faith when trying to conduct a transaction on Sr from the first step of getting btc to finding a good reputable vendor. I wanted to make a SHORT and SIMPLE list of guidelines for new ppl to follow since the buyers guide that dpr has set up seems to get skipped over by so many. if u follow these simple rules that ive learned through experience, these forums, and just wandering the site, youll have good experiences and we can keep thisplace up and running. <br /><br />1. buy ur btc from a 3rd party source with a escrow system. SR is not designed for these transactions yet as DPR says himself and its one of the easiest ways to get scammed. Localbitcoins.com seems to be the most used method around where i am and its my preferred choice as well and ive had flawless transaction history with them. <br /><br />2. Try and take every step possible to be as anonymous as possible from tumbling ur coins, keeping ur Tor browser bundle up to date, using pgp at all times, use T.A.I.L.S to cover ur tracks on ur main computer etc..&nbsp; The harder u make it for them to find ANYTHING out the better for you and everyone else here.<br /><br />3. DO NOT TELL PEOPLE ABOUT SILKROAD. i read a forum about kids posting there product on Tumblr (popular picture blog site on clearnet) and boasting about Sr. this is just asking for LE to come get you and worst of all there gunna try and crack down on us here. Keep this shit a secret as much as possible. only let ur most trusted ppl know and even tell them to tell No one. better yet just tell no one<br /><br />4.Compensate for bitcoin flluctuations and transfer fees. make sure ur depositing enough to cover any fees from 3rd party btc source, bitcoin fluctuations from time u start to end&nbsp; transfer process, ur product, and shipping. i see so many noobs asking for spare btc because there just a little short alllll the time. <br /><br />5.Find a reputable vendor before jumping into anything. when u first log on its so exciting u just wanna buy the first good deal u see but trust me when i tell u to check the forums and feedback to see if its legit. My motto is as long as u do ur proper research on the vendors and come to ur community for questions ull be good. i havent been scammed once for the 6 months ive been here ;)<br /><br />6.find safe drop spots and take precautions when getting ur packages. always be aware of ur surroundings and things out of the ordinary. The postal service delivers millions of packages a year....dont give them a reason to start payin attention to urs! make sure the person lives at the place the package is coming to.<br /><br />7. NEVER FINALIZE EARLY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER!!!!!!!! this is the most important rule. dont do even if the deal will be better or even if the vendor has been around as long as SR has. A good vendor will use the escrow system like there intended to to keep him and his customer completely happy. Even the most trusted vendor here has done ppl wrong. Just do urself a favor and NEVER FINALIZE EARLY!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />if theres anything else n e 1 wanst to add please feel free. i hope i help someone along the way. imma firm believer in karma :)

				Yeah good advice, but I think the cat is out of the bag as far as people knowing about SR is concerned.<br /><br />Not sure if that&#039;s a good or a bad thing really. Maybe if there&#039;s more visibility drugs will get legalized more quickly.

				OP I have had a similar experience to yours, all transactions have been fast and successful.&nbsp; Keep in mind vendor selection is important, I ind it pretty easy to tell if you are going to have a successful transaction.&nbsp; Yes the feedback is helpful, but cross check it with a quick search in forums for anything that may turn up.&nbsp; Look at the time they have been a vendor, if they&nbsp; have been here a year, they are probably pretty smart peoples, and provide what they say, and look at when they were last on.&nbsp; Check a few day in a row to see if they log on often.&nbsp; This may limit some of your choices, but I would rather pay a little more and get my stuff then hope some great deal is going to get delivered.<br /><br />But then some of you will say, none of the vendors will send to me unless I FE.&nbsp; Any Vendors that have FE requirement in there description, I just bypass period.&nbsp; If other vendors that don&#039;t list the requirement are asking you to do so when you order, ask yourself this:&nbsp; Did you pepper him with silly questions (like asking them if you HAVE to use encryption, or even worse how to use encryption, or asking shipping questions that are explained on their page), I am of the mindset if you cant figure out some of the basic steps then you probably shouldn&#039;t be on here, and the vendor will more than likely feel the same way and turn you away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have yet to even contact a vendor with other than my address, only placed orders and let them arrive.&nbsp; I would hope that if something did come up (lost package or whatever) that the vendor will be helpful as possible.&nbsp; Way more than you would get in real world for sure.

				Great post and important info for us newbs. I&#039;ve been curating a thread of vendors that do not require FE even for newbs. Check my sig for the link and if you know any good vendors that prefer to stay in escrow even for newbs then mention their name and I&#039;ll add them to the list!
