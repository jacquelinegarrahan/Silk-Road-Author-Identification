				I&#039;ve been using SR for some time now and haven&#039;t had much complaints, and when I have, sellers have usually dealt with them reasonably. Luckily I haven&#039;t interacted with any blatant scammers yet.<br /><br />Anyways recently thought I&#039;d try out a new (to me) seller&#039;s goods and they turned out to be totally unpleasant (fake, not even adulterated, just totally fake) and not as advertised. Trying to get a refund but we&#039;ll see what happens.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Although I was scammed out of $150 (planetexpress) my worst experience was after I didn&#039;t receive my order. I let him know I didn&#039;t receive and for days and days he didn&#039;t respond. I sent another message. He said he would get around refunding me. Another 2 weeks went by and nothing so I said fuck it and I gave him 1/5 feedback and said exactly what happened. That got his attention. He looked up MY INFORMATION on google and found information from &#039;mylife&#039; about my family and said if I didn&#039;t change it he would have no option but to take &quot;further action&quot;. Not knowing what he knew and what he didn&#039;t and not knowing what he was capable of I complied. It wasn&#039;t worth risking my or especially my family&#039;s safety for a couple hundred dollars.<br /><br />In the end, oddly enough, he sent me a long apology and my money back. Took like a month and a half but better late than never...

				Wow......glad it had a happy ending. Use cryptography in future. Also try sending it to someone else rather than yourself.

				True, I dont think crypto would have made a diff idk... I do know that being ripped off is the worst.. I lost $400 in a deal with a so called vendor that turned out to be a scammer/le. worst risk i ever took and lost it all SR deleted him almost instantly after but its not like i was gonna be able to get anything back. Now that SUCKED!!

He should have deleted it right after shipping out the goods.<br /><br />Back to the topic: I, as well as other, got FE scammed by format13 about a year ago. He offered some weed at a good price and had an otherwise good history. However, he insisted on FE and then no shipment came. Later he stated on his page that he got a lot of shipments and had to work through them. Then he just went quiet. Guess I had to learn the hard way about FE. Was only 70$, though.

He behaved for a while, sold hash and financial services, and then he probably got some large orders and never delivered.
