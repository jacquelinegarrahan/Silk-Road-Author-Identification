				What you can do is add an inert bulking agent which is ratioed (say for example, dextrose which is available from almost any pharmacy) and then mix it very well and then you can capsule it. :)

				Capsuling seems to be to best method yeah, but i&#039;d love to have some kind of candy or something, preferably something more stealth than a load of capsules :)

				Limitless to the rescue, btw mate i figured out why i couldnt fucking post...not enough posts on newbie? its the only thread section that offers a post icon but i remember posting on the other threads during xmas? is the post quota something new? it pisses me off because im not a fucking a newbie. its a guard against tards i guess. anyway that explains our mess yesterday.<br /><br />and im glad to see that people are asking about methods of properly applying alp powders before putting someone to sleep. i had two friends take some sugar cubes supposedly laced w xan and they ended up sleeping for 32 hours on the dock at my beach cottage. we thought they were fucking dead.&nbsp; be careful w the powders at 2 mgs you could ruin someones fucking life trying to unitize it. ESPECIALLY if youre one of those secret phenazepam fucks. not saying you are but there are some serious horror stories w phen.&nbsp;
