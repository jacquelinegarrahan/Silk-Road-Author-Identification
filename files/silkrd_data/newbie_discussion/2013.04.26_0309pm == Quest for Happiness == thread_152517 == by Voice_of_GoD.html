				From the vast Universe, a voice emerges, one from within one&#039;s own mind... <br /><br />It speaks to us; it answers our prayers; it ignores our needs; it helps and hurts; it is human thought. If God does exist, then he certainly exists within ourselves, as does all types of matter and energy, other biological symbiotes, sometimes parasites and other malicious code--that is, DNA. Good code preserves our being and our consciousness, but that is another story altogether.<br /><br />Life is an infinitely complicated conversation, and it is slowly emerging. Some users manage to conform and communicate without hostility or conflict. That is not to say there isn&#039;t difficulties--scammers and thieves exist in all parts of life, as well as the unliving: meteors, volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, tides, weather, gamma ray bursts, screaming planet-sized rocks that once orbited supernova or gravity-accelerated from spinning masses or black holes. A spinning galaxy will lose its mass over time to entropy; where the tails of a spiral galaxy, for example, lose gas, ice, rocks and stars to interstellar space. These are resources for a great species yet to come, but as we all have witnessed, fiction often predicts the great things to come. Around the world in 80 days. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Every space science fiction ever conceived, these are just a matter of time.<br /><br />A robotic patrol is traversing the Martian planet. It is the first reliable security camera, an off planet drone, that samples and patrols for the U.S. Government and the world. If there is a threat, it is made public. If major events happen anywhere in the world, it goes public almost instantaneously through WiFi transmissions, privately owned devices which utilize semi-public and/or private networks. Satellites detected xenon over DPRK (North Korea), confirming the detonation of a nuclear energy device, giving conclusive evidence that the 4.something magnitude (Richter)--or was it 5 something?--was NOT an earthquake. Humans once only used smoke and fire on hilltops, sometimes sunlight on reflective glass or precious metal; now we use precious metals from complex computing machines--electromagnetic wonders of modern times....<br /><br />I digress, but I want to wonder and wander down the path to enlightenment and inspiration... Modern Times, the here and now, have more benefits and knowledge than any time in human history. Each day humans continue to survive as a species, tomorrow will ALWAYS bring new knowledge and better performance. Machines did not deliver as much power 5 years ago as they do today. Every day is a gift, because people are always working to continue, self preservation under the constant risk of failure. Sometimes we do fail, but overall, our net growth has been positive and successful. Technology is racing forward, and not much longer from now, the entire world will be connected through open and (nearly) free means of communication. There are countless NGOs and other non-profit organizations that help the suffering, abroad and domestically.<br />

				This Silk Road thing that has begun through Tor is offering a social policy change through democracy. It is allowing people to choose freely how they want to use the resources available to them. Hard working people have earned money or some object of value, and currently they are expressing their right as free people to purchase substances that alter their consciousness. As an aside, allow me to detour in order to better define what &quot;altered consciousness&quot; really means and why it is so important to some people who choose to deny its access. <br /><br />What else alters our consciousness? <br /><br />Reading? <br /><br />Certainly.<br /><br />Cooking and eating?<br /><br />Most definitely.<br /><br />Driving?<br /><br />Yep.<br /><br />Studying?<br /><br />Of course.<br /><br />An altering consciousness is an involuntary reaction to healthy human minds. Altering is a subset of the category: developing. When psychonautical exploration is encouraged, recorded, and studied, then the complexity of our consciousness is expanded through gains in knowledge. So when people choose to use substances, and certain substances are banned and &quot;controlled&quot; (although I don&#039;t know who actually controls them, the DEA or the Cartels... which is slowly changing to legally operated businesses within individual states of America, taxed and regulated; thank you Silk Road creators!), then all the medical and psychological knowledge is lost, leaving holes in effective treatment and therapy for drug abuse. <br /><br />Drug use is separate from drug abuse. Drug use can occur in the absence of drug abuse, just like doctors and nurses abuse medical &quot;bribes&quot; from pharmaceutical companies to push understudied, and often newly developed (and expensive!) drugs. It makes no different how drugs are obtained, there will always be abuse, whether through addiction or through greed. Abuse should be the focus of every sector of public policy. The Drug War is evidence enough of how corrupt public servants, such as police and federal agents, are highly susceptible to bribes, extortion, misguidance, career goals (ambition), drug addiction, falsifying documents, stealing, kidnappings, murder... It is a human trait, and the sooner we recognize it and take responsibility for our leaders&#039; actions--unless we do not live in a democracy; in which case we must revolt until democracy exists--the sooner peace will infect the planet, and the stars will truly belong to our great race.

				I wake up everyday to a different world, different from the last I saw when sleep displaced they night. The sun rises now, hot and red, heating the dry sands of no man&#039;s land, and breathing life into the planet with its waves of crashing energy, insistent and ceaseless. Another pot candy bar please, hand crafted chocolate infused with cannabis and other favorite treats, a coffee-tea made from locally grown coca leaves, and a mix of Mocha and Arabica beans. Now, my day begins. Breakfast. Stretches. Exercises. Then work...<br /><br />I grew up under those who complained about work. The problems were always the same: family, friends, people, weather, the government, traffic madness, ad infinitum. Human affairs. Rupert Murdoch has brought the human soap opera to everyone&#039;s lives by creating turmoil and misinformation in our day to day social and mental life. Monotonous and excessive &quot;news&quot; coverage until the majority of each affected society is frustrated and inundated with bad information. Where is Bill Nye the Science Guy? NASA? Public Education?<br /><br />Why have our so called educators abandoned commercial and private media, leaving a void so great that such parasitic and harmful broadcasts push the general public away from intelligent decisions, away from good information, away from the Truth? Has science and scientists given up on education altogether? Replaced by bureaucratic hierarchy and pay walled journal articles... <br /><br />How many public universities offer their accomplishments--knowledge and wisdom--to the public? How many professors and educators hold public events at parks and greenspaces--where and when people have recreational time--at museums and libraries?<br /><br />Humanistic ideals have suffered greatly under corporate rule. Nothing has changed since the days of kingdoms, when a King ruled the land, and men were slaves and indentured servants. If you have money and power, then the only guarantee of astounding returns is through education. If you possess knowledge, then volunteer your time to the greatest resource available: human communities.

Floating under solar arms, lifted sometimes by rising, turbulent thermals and other times by winged balloons in the jet stream. It was my house boat, only it hasn&#039;t touched land in over a decade. Occasional dips in the ocean, but no land in as long as I found the courage to live up above. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria grow the precursors to proteins and high energy fuels. Solar waves heat gas chambers, extracting water from the atmosphere. A few fish and many plants keep me company during my voyages across global skies.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152517.msg1057376#msg1057376">Quote from: Voice_of_MaN on April 26, 2013, 08:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I grew up under those who complained about work.

It was here that I realized the greatest human potential: free and accurate information. C-Span for government... instead of hearing news second-hand, I found comfort in hearing how awful--and optimistically inspiring--public policy can be. Torrents, over which Aaron Schwartz lost his life, carried me a great deal farther, providing details and explanations for all the things discussed on C-Span... from politics, social problems, economics, science, and religion--here and abroad. Music and culture via broadband connections, education and inspiration--all this on a $100 netbook. As an old saying goes: nothing borrowed, nothing gained. <br /><br />How can anyone give back to social order when there is so much social entropy?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152517.msg1057376#msg1057376">Quote from: Voice_of_MaN on April 26, 2013, 08:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why have our so called educators abandoned commercial and private media, leaving a void so great that such parasitic and harmful broadcasts push the general public away from intelligent decisions, away from good information, away from the Truth?

				Road Users:<br /><br />Customers:<br /><br />When receiving packages, please politely destroy all address labels, stamps, USPS tracking codes on your package. Burn by flame or saturate with water, until names, addresses, and bar codes are no longer legible to human or machine eyes.<br /><br />Vendors: <br /><br />Be sure to use a soy-based ink so that information quickly rinses away... but not that quickly, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Always have a back up plan. If you have lots of cash: lawyer. If you have lots of product: security.... Exit strategies....<br /><br />Also, when trafficking... one should always limit the amounts of ACTUAL product... say 1 in 10 packages you receive... 9 should be legit.<br /><br />Money Laundering? go the educated route: through legitimate business practices; charities; good accounting!<br /><br />Enjoy the Road.

				My happiness comes from experiences. Each moment of life is another second in a world that is modestly predictable and exciting. Those who participate in Silk Road know how untarnished we remain in the wake of decisions that redefine liberty and freedom more broadly and just. Our [respective] nation, if it has access to TOR and laissez faire ISPs/governments, or at least to open source technology, then what we call our nation &quot;home&quot;. I want to live and die in my nation, with my family, with my friends, as someone who always held himself to higher standards. I want to persist in their own lives and memories. <br /><br />Memory is a moral compass, pointing the same direction no matter how lost I become or how far I drift or when visibility ceases. When things go wrong, I can stop and reflect on what is and what has been, and better choices are made from these moments of pause. While some things may be forgotten altogether, not to be forgotten are the thoughts and actions about solidifying peace and prosperity. <br /><br />Remember who we are.
