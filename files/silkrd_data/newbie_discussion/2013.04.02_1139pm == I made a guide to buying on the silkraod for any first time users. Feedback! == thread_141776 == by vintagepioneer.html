				Sadly you will not be able to make a purchase tomorrow.<br />But here is the answers you will be looking for.<br />To change your money into bitcoins you will need a bank account.<br />If you have a bank account you will need to know your account number and the line of numbers that show up on the bottom of a check.&nbsp; You know the ones I&#039;m<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;talking about.<br /><br />Next you will go to coinbase.com<br />Obviously you will be creating an account with them.<br />To be able to buy the bitcoins from this service you will then need to link your bank account with them. (This is where the account number and check number<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will come into play)<br /><br />I know you will want to just be able to use your debit card to buy bitcoins but that&#039;s just not gunna happen.<br />Once you have this information filled out, the verification process will take about 5 days.<br />In my case coinbase.com had to take an extra precautionary measure and put a small amount of money into my bank account and I then had to tell them the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;amount they put in. I go into such detail about this as a way to enforce the security that this place has to ease any worries you might have about giving<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;away so much confidential information.<br /><br />Once all the bank information has been verified with coinbase you are now able to purchase your first bitcoin!<br />As I type this one bitcoin has risen to about 100 dollars. (american)<br />A little tip that I suggest is in your sr setting change the currency to show the dollar amount at the begging for a better perspective on the &quot;real world prices.&quot;<br /><br />It will take 3 or so days for the order to be processed for your coin.<br />Once the coin has arrived in your coinbase.com account you will need to transfer that over to silkroad.<br />To do so send your money to your specialized bitcoin silkroad address.<br />To see it you will go to your account then&nbsp; the click here to make a deposit button.<br />It will then show you your bitcoin address!<br />Now go back over to coinbase.com and send your money over.<br /><br />You make think that you are now ready to make your fist purchase on silkroad.<br />I&#039;m sorry but not quite yet.<br /><br />This thing we&#039;re doing isn&#039;t some amazon one click buy type of shit.<br />You are going to need to actually communicate with the vendors.<br />It&#039;s easy to disassociate yourself from the idea behind those usernames you see are actual people.<br />And like you they want their transactions to be as safe as possible to not get thrown in jail.<br /><br />You will need to learn to encrypt and decrypt messages.<br />To do so you&#039;re going to need a few applications.<br />I&#039;ll just start by saying I&#039;m on a mac:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GPG (https://gpgtools.org/installer/index.html)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Textmate (http://macromates.com/download)<br /><br />The GPG will basically be used as an address keeper.<br />Textmate will be used to make and decrypt messages.<br />Now you may think this all seems a little over the top and not necessary for you to learn but the fact is no one will do business with you if you&#039;re not encrypting<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your messages so fucking learn this.<br /><br />Before you make your first purchase you really need to practice sending and receiving these encrypted messages.<br />You don&#039;t want to make an ass out of yourself infront of these cool drug dealer guys by sending a fucked up email that he can&#039;t read.<br /><br />In GPG create a new key. You can use any email and name you want it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />The messages you receive or send or whatever will not show up at that place.<br />I suggest using your real name and an email that relates to your silkroad username.<br />You&#039;ll then choose a secret passphrase. This passphrase will be used later on so don&#039;t forget it.<br /><br />To use textmate efficiently you are going to need to change the settings<br />on your mac.<br />Go to settings and then go to the keyboard options.<br />In the left column on the keyboard options you&#039;re gunna go to the services.<br />If you scroll down far enough you will eventually see the boxes for the GPG settings. Select all of those.<br /><br />Now that we&#039;re done setting this up it&#039;s now time to put it in action.<br /><br />We&#039;ll start by setting up your first address in your GPG keychain.<br />For example I&#039;ll use Scout who&#039;s a pretty big deal in the sr forum world.<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />mQENBFDyZ9cBCAC8u36Z9K/iqJRy2oCIL0ObS0dEQqCd4k/WgBooTRAleCPgAVH8<br />XUPJfvGNFxkJsiLcIwk8YUfEE1/hn3IQIvsoe0qDQSJ5+t7GE/RoEqd3UJUXFZf+<br />NxSSHkvE/yG2IB9oIJJ7UCsqQ/FG/QceLbqesNboH0eNG4JGWY4ottGqMuBeQMFu<br />XQP/Ata25o5EqIRIZKlLxMHbGfXFrd3CNPA8cJcmxE1aH4ZkOVqLFZBsYuRmex+i<br />ForaiTsq9geGZHlYZBqqWH/uPr0cYXRu3NLqLfkYjvG3I83PYxH/dgcLQmWT9C2/<br />S38YStJKmHrsQzVRdBJor/g/qf8IrSG0JKx1ABEBAAG0GXNjb3V0IDxzYzB1dEB0<br />b3JtYWlsLm9yZz6JAT8EEwECACkFAlDyZ9cCGy8FCQeEzgAHCwkIBwMCAQYVCAIJ<br />CgsEFgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRBQNeWC2yFZt8lWB/0fkjzf/3oWSIfZH7AXfBcjx2Tz<br />QpI7uRZbQseck8W/eGikQqJ1N0Pzw40O1kPgozzrCMrLirphT8rGhpw8RzqQu+pp<br />BBfeZIwg2kRNUfJdTZ/L2wnq0X5LSO682BAmzX5k4Tt75aBc3jnq45xVx9B0c7DL<br />kAXw7uroxmYWLEj5jUmB4tHpRxzgvNXmKBvR8jC7LNFEFawBHUtFTPDsjqEFed8s<br />fLqbmz9Jd7Of2CcFwvIaLxu588RO70zuCwdJWflxTSapIjTyZdfeo5Kt+pNJXQJE<br />gZx2BHOq9PlYTOLf6QehLLWa7Gp7PvgmV4z5xKhP+luPOK8uugamySMgX/jKuQEN<br />BFDyZ9cBCADPBZhvoV3MZL0Tjn5nixz1TQbw8Gp8uA25FCAPkRPv5YE5cBPjZgon<br />fkDZcGJ/kz47OSe+CLps6sTxRYV6rTMS3JAGFmEJX4Il/zzWXNC5h65vxxgI+gf+<br />iBynIW2IG/4/hBv6NJEx2mEpTyxvrfzy+NtCADBQSf9m+20LszM2EvzTtqh5uQwr<br />CJ+2R0yabOYJpuHbHtlS40TsdyvbATThXFoOxGVmOV6D40Yl254JfxDsO9dc8yLv<br />JNRz/fbIetJuBxAyW1Q2cq1siShxMyAFrugoKiTRAozHYFe6vM97Td4cV1FNjJXn<br />FBZwzVETAIQQAWdR6zrNsbvKJEPfgXtfABEBAAGJAkQEGAECAA8FAlDyZ9cCGy4F<br />CQeEzgABKQkQUDXlgtshWbfAXSAEGQECAAYFAlDyZ9cACgkQSBRDI3bw2sqb7Qf/<br />RRQv/FUR4t6i7vPtjozVQO1EjjebwpaeppqPczNA3oU9jwhE451EOxH2Kbxzt/ME<br />lupntH7pD/DrVvYmEv6JwIRWwzuTIIL+CpXtj4HWDtK27ZqEs6qCWH9d5SzizowS<br />3Wz4knrQTPQHYqoXtbParbrufBnW7EkiQNRW6AySF+VpA79PzOQtND+cCSebEFpB<br />O7+b5e6uOr/wBafiUH3isatrvcIBg4km3NSF7prj0m+0n0pENP1KNfTrPlBb0oRP<br />tf29MY/3UmlA8By84XaGOU0QQIGytaosxw5P+GYpa6mVlCTn1usXWv//YY6noJfx<br />15F+e4rYhXzW2Qx7xorpZ+doCACb/emVZsPmI/r4uwvM28l9E3YHJvh4lG4pwarc<br />dfvvAbPn1fHhsBUv4tl378Wc7tt7gL+nuXdPZGRBUdoF3ET8ZrKk254Ed92B0yVz<br />aO4omGpV2LgkGTBa7Og0H+NnHsU+b2axyqCJRiQ4KSYdAewDpMNAij8oqO0fnEIj<br />kqlt96mU1rp1/qABCGpRLHyA8GaD614lB2spOiMs4sczpinwDfu2VWuUNHps2U/S<br />W/8kWSopw5Xv37hYlhsuIWpTxO/J5Cuswniz4iSbROCrSSi9PKVWnQ+ZYMtkDoqt<br />lpo9Y+s/1SoYBfB0WMBC44N5jLVcuy+ezoC/lm6R9n8wtmCu<br />=blbb<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />You will highlight everything from the first set of ----&#039;s to the last set of ----&#039;s nothing before nothing after.<br />Copy this and bring it over to text mate.<br />Select the whole thing obviously and right click and choose services.<br />Click on &quot;Import Key From Selection&quot;<br /><br />This is what we call a public key.

				Thanks OP!&nbsp; I note that Coinbase (which seems to be the cheapest way to get BTC) is now taking about 4 days to get your coins, and you will get it at the price on the 4 day. In a run-up like what we are in now, that&#039;s a pretty severe penalty, athough if the price collapses it would be great, of course. I&#039;m leaning to adding a Bitfog step between Coinbase and SR, just to make me feel better. Oh wait -- that&#039;s what I&#039;m buying the drugs for, isn&#039;t it?

				Annoymous is the key, get coins with cash not linked to anything, just send cash to whichever service and have sent to blockchain wallet.&nbsp; As for PGP you can just google igolder encryption its a gold trading site that has a free encryption page, has one box to paste pgp key of vendor, another box to enter your info, then hit encrypt copy and paste thats it no need to learn any other pgp realted stuff.&nbsp; As for ordering, never use real name unless its an adrress that cant be linked to you, i prefer domestic casue it seems way safer to me.&nbsp; Get greedy start needing stuff from all over the world and one day you might get fucked, just my opion but im a paranoid fucker sooo...&nbsp; Most importantly enjoy, cause having access to these amazing substances if uesd right can enhance your life not take away from it, oh and iv made a bundle just by sitting on bitcoins woooo :)

I&#039;m just looking around for the most efficient and best way to set up bitcoins. I did Bitinstant through Mt. Gox and I have to say that it ended up eating a chunk of my money and wasn&#039;t all that anonymous. 2 steps of the process required ID, and I know that you can bypass those, but you sort of have to know that ahead of time. Some of the other ways to get coins have long lag times which is a tough deal in the current bubble environment.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty much settling on not trying to disguise my initial purchase too much, but then do a reasonable laundering on their way into SR.&nbsp; Seems the best balance for me.

If you can&#039;t figure them out you might as well forget about the rest. Email them, wait for reply with instructions, deposit cash at BoA, BTC sent to your account. Done. Bitfloor also uses BoA. Bitcopia uses Wells Fargo.
