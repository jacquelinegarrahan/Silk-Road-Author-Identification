				Hello, I made my first/second order.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; The orders were accepted by SR,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the first order went through fine and I could see the finalize button.&nbsp; Every thing went good on this as it was to purchase bitcoins.&nbsp; <br /><br />The second order is acting different It says &quot;processing&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;but I can&#039;t see the finalize button.&nbsp; Does the supplier have to accept the order before I can see the finalize button ?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks, AW

				Oh Cool, i also notice that it says NA under auto finalize and there is no cancel button.&nbsp; I guess this is normal.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am looking for a good H dealer.&nbsp; I am in the north east.&nbsp; I snort it so I&#039;m guessing #4 would be the best.&nbsp; it seems like many od the best dealers are gone, closed to new people etc...&nbsp; I was going to try Subsrgood but he is out.&nbsp; supremesmoke is closed to new guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;CarlitosBrigante, mrgood247 are out. <br /><br />&nbsp;I did order a bit from Dieseltherapy (blue diamond)&nbsp; does anyone know what coast he is located on ?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any other suggestions, i am looking for a quick a shipment to the northeast&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks, aw78&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Right. Just means that the seller hasn&#039;t confirmed the order yet. No big deal.

Stamps aren&#039;t generally found on the West coast, they have sell H in different ways there like balloons. That&#039;s why it&#039;s called ECP (East Coast Powder).<br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure DieselTherapy is your best bet as a quick vendor. I can&#039;t be sure, but I just made my first order with him and I&#039;m having second thoughts. He&#039;s really backed up with orders (says on his vendor page). He doesn&#039;t respond to messages at all, everyone has said so in his review thread (search his name in the forum to find it). It takes him about a day or so to mark the order in transit. I am waiting to see how fast I get my shipment, I&#039;m in the Southeast. If it gets here quick then it will make up for his poor customer service.<br /><br />Like I said, search his name (or any other vendor&#039;s name) in the forums first so you can make a more informed decision. People tend to be a lot more honest in the forum reviews than on the feedback page.

				Ahh I do miss that ECP.... I grew up in the northeast but moved south for work. Don&#039;t get me wrong, tar will get you fucked, but it&#039;s just not the same. If you don&#039;t believe me just ask my veins

				I know what CW is and I know what tar is. Around here we get bags mostly from New york city.&nbsp; But they don&#039;t call them afghan #3 or #4.&nbsp; I know that #4 is probably the best for snorting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried tar a few times but it&#039;s not common on the east coast.&nbsp; When we did get it we froze it and put it in a coffee grinder with mannitol to make it snortable.
