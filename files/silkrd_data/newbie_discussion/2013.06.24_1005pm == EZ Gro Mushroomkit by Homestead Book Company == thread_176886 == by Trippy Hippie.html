				Has anyone heard of this?? It&#039;s unrelated to SR... I saw an ad for it in High Times magazine. Here&#039;s the site and product:<br /><br />http://www.homesteadbook.com/store/ez-gro-mushroomkit-p-141.html<br /><br />They also have a Facebook page and everything... I&#039;m a little skeptical about how public it is, but the mushroom growing kit they are selling does, after all, only sell spores, which are legal. Do you think it&#039;s safe to order from them, though? They claim to have sold thousands of these kits, and the site has a number of positive reviews. It seems like a great deal that yields a lot of homegrown mushrooms. Right up my alley. But again, it&#039;s very public. In general, does ordering spores, though legal, draw attention from LE to the potential illegal things one could do with them? (i.e. grow shrooms)<br /><br />Just looking for some other people&#039;s take on this... Thanks

				So would you recommend buying the kit or not? Are there other reliable places to buy spores for much cheaper? Or, consider all the various components I would need to buy - all of this added up, plus the spores, do you think it&#039;d be less than $130? That&#039;s the price of the kit from Homestead and it supposedly includes everything I&#039;d need.
