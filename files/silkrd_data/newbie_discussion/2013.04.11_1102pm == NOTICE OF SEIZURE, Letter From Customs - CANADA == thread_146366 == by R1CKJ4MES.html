				Today I woke up to a slip in the mail telling me to go to the nearest post office to pick up a latter. I Had no idea and sense I have Family from over seas that its was only a surprise, maybe a post card or something with a nice letter. ANYWAYS after I went in a signed for it, I had noticed the outside of the letter say it was from Canada.. This kinda seemed strange, I opened to see a sheet saying NOTICE OF SEIZURE<br /><br />Parcel From: S. Bergan, The Netherlands<br /><br />The parcel contained 50gr of a white crystalline powder: analysed as Amphetamine. Amphetamine is a controlled substance therefore prohibited for importation..<br /><br />Funny thing I never ordered 50gr of Amphetamine.. I have ordered other 50gr orders, thinking it was MDMA..&nbsp; :o :-\<br /><br />Anyways should I be worried?, I have seen alot of people saying just throw it out and that they have had it sent many times and nothing was done. &amp; It was sent under my first name but with a different, Middle &amp; last name<br /><br />Anything thoughts and ideas on what I should do.

				Throw it out. If all you got was a love letter, nothing will happen. Who knows if they flag addresses, though.
