				What&#039;s your (almost or most) favorite/memorable music + drug experience? This can be concert/festival/listening to a record at home etc. while under the influence of or while coming up on a substance.<br /><br />Name the music event/artist/song etc. and name the drug. Add a little bit of story or just list the combo!

				One time, I did an obscene amount of mushrooms and listened to an album called &quot;Bigger Fish Frying&quot; by a western Canadian artist called &quot;Longwalkshortdock&quot;. He has music available for free online, bit this album in particular is what you want. I&#039;m looking forward to his next one. <br /><br />The music itself is unlike anything I have ever heard. It is a blend of electronic, ambient, vocal, and organic elements that combine to make something one might call, &quot;ambient electro pop&quot; .. or something... but it is entirely its own thing.<br /><br />By the time the final note had played on the final song (fittingly titled &quot;Life Is a Sine Wave&quot;) I had learned much about life and my place in it.<br /><br />It&#039;s cool music to listen to sober, but when tripping it takes on a much more profound tone. <br />I guarantee it will captivate the shit out of anyone while high, no matter what your musical tastes.

				I did maybe 150 ug of acid one time and decided to listen to Pink Floyd&#039;s &quot;The Wall&quot; in the dark. I&#039;m not sure which song it was (it might have been Hey You) but I had a very unnerving hallucination/dream thing that I was in an underwater cave full of maggots.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t freak out; it was actually rather relaxing after a while. I feel like I&#039;m much less terrified of bugs now.

				The Wall is one of my favorite albums ever, but it is really depressing and scary a lot of the time, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want to listen to that tripping. <br /><br />I love to smoke some ganja and jam out. Man on the Moon: The End of Day by KiD CuDi is what originally got me into smoking and eventually the drug scene. I know that album is pretty popular so if anyone remembers that you should support his new album INDICUD that&#039;s gonna be released on 4/16 just in time for the holiday. Or if you poor just download the leak and enjoy the new jams from the Cudder!

				Listen to Tame Impalas &quot;Mind Mischief&quot; and get ready to lose your mind or become one with it.

				well, there was the shpongle show where i ate 5 tabs of some primo lsd. every single person in the ballroom was tripping balls. we were all swimming around in an ocean of consciousness riding the waves of crazy positive vibrations. i&#039;m pretty sure the woman on my left was at least twice my age, and to my right was a guy who i kept thinking i had seen before but at the same time i knew this was the first time i met him, and he wasn&#039;t even dancing, he just stood amongst the gyrating mass of bodies and laughed like a 6-foot tall child.<br /><br />then there was the psytrance festival where me and a friend consumed (between the two of us, over the course of 72 hours) 8 tabs of acid, 50 mg 2c-b, 300mg mda, 1500mg mdma, and an ounce of the dankest stickiest fluffiest weed i have ever come across in my life. to be honest, i don&#039;t remember *too* much about the music, but it was very good, and it didn&#039;t stop, and neither did our trip. it took me five more days and another half ounce to come down from that.
