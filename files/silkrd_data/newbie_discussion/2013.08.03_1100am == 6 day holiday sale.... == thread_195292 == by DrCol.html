				I hope you&#039;ll forgive me the alert - but I know it takes a little while to organise BTC and place orders (especially for those new to the road)...and I don&#039;t want anyone to miss out, or be left without supplies while I&#039;m away. So yes, it&#039;s true...I have six days until my vacation and a new stock of cola for you! :) <br /><br />I will be generous as always and the process is working smoothly for rapid dispatch (usually same day service)<br /><br />If you need supplies, please place orders as soon as you can as I will definitely be away for ten days and all listings will obviously be suspended whilst I get some rest and relaxation!! :) <br /><br />I&nbsp; offer really friendly and professional service, great quality cola and will do all I can to help make the transaction smooth and enjoyable.<br /><br />Here are some of today&#039;s feedback comments to encourage you:<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very nice indeed :)<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Doc you came through again xx Ok everyone heads up time this from the Doc is the real thing, as a comparative virgin to coke if you take a dip test and your tongue immediately goes numb that is cheap crap loaded with Novocaine or something similar. This from the doc is a smooth hit and no edginess... Its good folks<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing. Ordered late Sunday night, western US, arrived on Friday. .25 sample was a tiny bit over weight. Quality was smooth, euphoric and numbing. No burn on the way up, no anxiety on the way down. Packaging was beyond reproach. DrCol is an excellent vendor, and goes above and beyond for his customer&#039;s satisfaction and security. <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excellent product, excellent timeframes, great stealth here to oz. Thankyou Dr Col <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superb vendor. Top marks for stealth. Took slightly longer than I&#039;d expected - 3 workings days (domestic) - but well worth the wait. I thought I&#039;d had good stuff before but this puts all my previous purchases of this product to shame. A+<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product was delivered in only 3 days! That&#039;s really superb! Good job, Doc. I will test the product tonight! Thanks, Doc!<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doc does it again 100%<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very professional. discrete packaging, excellent communication, and most importantly: best quality for the bitcoin so far.<br /><br />Many thanks and have a great weekend everyone!<br /><br />Doc
