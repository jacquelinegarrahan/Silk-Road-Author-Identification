				I was blown away by the service I got. Great price, was in transit less than an hour after I ordered and made it to my house in about 24 hours.

				First order was with JahBUDS for some Family acid.... Now I have tired a lot of acid from different vendors.... but this WOW acid was just pure LOVE.... I have had hundreds of tabs through my hands since then but this acid was something special.....&nbsp; <br /><br />Waiting on a vial from JOR at the moment and I am sure this will meet or surpass what I experienced back then...&nbsp; also the DMT from JOR is absolutely beautiful and special...<br /><br />mm

				I can&#039;t figure out how to justify purchasing with NOD. 25% of his cost is just reputation.

				The vendors rep is most important to me...I&#039;ve trolled around a while and Nod has a stellar rep. That old saying my granny used to say...you get what you pay for.

				Wow that sounds incredible.&nbsp; I have only had one transaction so far.&nbsp; It was for a sample of some of the best weed I have had in a long time.&nbsp; Vendor name was pkizenko98.&nbsp; Very friendly chap, was super helpful in every way.&nbsp; I hope to order from him again soon

				My first was about a month or so ago. I got some MDMA from UnderGroundSyndicate. It came so fast, I was very pleased. I didn&#039;t get to try it until a few days ago. Very clean.<br /><br />Done about 12 orders now, all went pretty well, even from overseas. Loving this SR so far.

				I don&#039;t want to be tough on anyone but for now I am only doing business with 100% vendors with a lot of transactions. I think it is best to pay a small premium for reliable delivery, product and packaging! Early on I had a few experiences with people in the high 90 percentile and a few bad comments and I though &quot;heck, those were probably just one off mistakes&#039;! Boy was I fucking wrong. The items were not mailed when I was told they were and they arrived pretty poorly packaged. If your weed is in transit for 12 days and is only packaged pretty well it&#039;s going to arrive at your door smelling like, well, pot! Dont put your freedom in the hands of amateurs no matter how nice they seem at first! Every day I went to check the mail I walked around the block first looking for cops, and come to find out the item was marked in transit for a week before it was actually in transit! Throughout this entire process keep in mind that what you are doing is illegal! Only a real disrespectful prick would put your freedom on the line like that!
