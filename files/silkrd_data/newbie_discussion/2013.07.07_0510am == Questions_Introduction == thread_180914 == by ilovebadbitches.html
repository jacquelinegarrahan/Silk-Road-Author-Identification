				Hello all, <br /><br />I&#039;m writing with two purposes:<br /><br />1) As a newbie here on SR, the first purchase I&#039;m looking to make is a fake U.S. driver&#039;s license. I basically already have it down to two vendors, but I want to throw it out to the community before I make a decision. Anybody have good/bad/mediocre experiences with any of the IDs/vendors in the &quot;novelty&quot; business?<br /><br />And, perhaps more importantly,<br /><br />2) As a new kid on the block, I thought I&#039;d introduce myself to what seems to be a pretty chill community here on the forums. I look forward to getting to know y&#039;all, and hope to one day make it out of the newb-zone :p.<br /><br />Peace,<br />ilbb

				Bump.<br /><br />With an additional question:<br /><br />Is it best to deposit funds into my account straight from BitInstant? Or to put them into an offsite wallet and then transfer them from there?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t give any advice on IDs as I have no experience buying/selling/testing ones sold here on SR.<br /><br />As to your other question: I typically transfer purchased coins (which I buy through an exchanger) to a temporary wallet, wash them with a laundry service, then deposit on any number of sites like SR when and only when I&#039;m going to purchase. I try not to leave excess coins sitting in the account.<br /><br />Transferring from Bitinstant straight to your SR &quot;wallet&quot; should be fine as long as the amount is small and you spend it quickly.<br /><br />Much luck on your purchases!<br /><br />meta

				Don&#039;t expect to do anything professional with the IDs that you get here.&nbsp; If you&#039;re buying it to buy alcohol and get in clubs then cool but if it&#039;s for something else then I wouldn&#039;t bother.&nbsp; Some of the middle man their IDs through clearnet fake ID providers.

				I&#039;d be unsure myself like others said you can get a &quot;novelty&quot; ID from clearweb that will get u with bottles and bitches but hand a cop it and its over.

				Thanks for the replies everyone!<br /><br />Does clearnet/web mean the regular (non-Tor/SR) internet? If so, it seems the relative security of escrow might make buying here worth it even if they are middlemen.<br /><br />And I definitely wouldn&#039;t be doing anything professional with them, just getting into bars, etc.
