				Up until today, it has always gone into my account within an hour.<br />&nbsp;Today however it is 3 hours and still waiting. I&#039;ve checked&nbsp; blockchain, and it is at 21 confirmations.<br />&nbsp;Hopefully it will be in before my vendors cutoff for same day shipping in the morning.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Well over 48hrs one time, maybe closer to 72 hrs. A couple of other times like 24hrs. However, I have never had coin disappear, in the end it always arrives safe and sound. Also, delays over 2-3 hrs are rare, and getting rarer. I know it&#039;s crap, but SR Support will be working overtime to fix, AB.

				It seems you were right,&nbsp; &nbsp;it&#039;s in my account now.&nbsp; I did read the other thread in the main forum though, so I realised after my last post (whinge LOL) that there had been a problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;
