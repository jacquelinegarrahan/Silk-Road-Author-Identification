				While I like the new feedback system, it is my opinion that the captions for each of the ratings should be changed as soon as possible before vendor ratings go down wrongfully.<br /><br />With drugs, you know what you&#039;re buying. If you&#039;re buying cocaine, you&#039;re getting cocaine. In this way, drugs are different from products like electronics. You know you&#039;re buying a DVD player, but there are countless different types of DVD players. Some are slow, unresponsive and laggy, some are user friendly and pretty to look at... There&#039;s a whole lot of properties a DVD player can have.<br /><br />Of course drugs vary in quality/purity/potency, ease of administration, odor, health risks due to byproducts and contaminants, etc. (Note that I&#039;m talking about variation in one specific substance, not between all drugs in general. DVD player, refrigerator and computer = cocaine, weed and meth, you get the deal.) But the state of the product is usually described by the vendor. You are usually informed about the quality of the coke you order.<br /><br />These are the captions describing the meaning of each rating:<br />5 - WOW! Outstanding!<br />4 - Solid, would recommend<br />3 - Meh, they&#039;re ok I guess<br />2 - Definitely needs improvement<br />1 - NEVER AGAIN!!!<br /><br />Now, let&#039;s say I&#039;m a noob who placed a $70 order for a gram of low-grade coke. The item is described by the vendor as having very low potency and being very cut. After three days the gram has safely arrived a few countries away. The stealth is excellent. I now try the product, and I&#039;m not impressed, simply because I got what I paid for. I got coke that reflects the price delivered quickly and stealthily. More importantly, the product description was 100% accurate. It doesn&#039;t cause the reaction &quot;WOW! Outstanding!&quot; but it deserves no less than 5/5.<br /><br />I get the feeling that you&#039;re trying to make feedback more valuable and accurate and steer away from the current situation in which anything below 5/5 is a negative rating, and in which buyers who leave less than 5/5 are blacklisted, etc. But if one was to use those captions for guidance when rating, vendors would be getting unfair feedback -- because noobs&#039; reactions to paying for a product and the product arriving flawlessly as described, will resemble &quot;Meh, they&#039;re ok I guess&quot; or &quot;Solid, would recommend.&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes there never comes up a situation in which the vendor&#039;s customer service is tested, but you can&#039;t refrain from giving a 5/5 rating because of a lack of issue, and you can&#039;t refrain from giving a 5/5 because you didn&#039;t get MORE than what you paid for. A rating should be a combination of how accurate the description was, how stealthy the shipment was, how long it took the vendor to ship the package (which is hard to say, so I wouldn&#039;t even take this into consideration unless shipping time exceeds all realistic delays at the post office), and how helpful the vendor has been if there should be questions or problems (a lack thereof should NOT result in a lower rating).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, you guys. Not only are the captions not an appropriate/fair guide, they also sound very unprofessional, not to mention the inconsistent use of uppercase and punctuation, but that&#039;s not important and is a matter of taste. I&#039;m probably not the only guy with OCD who&#039;s been annoyed by this, though.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />- An order can be 100% as described and shipped stealthily and fast without any problems or need for communication between seller and buyer occurring, thus definitely deserving 5/5, without inspiring reactions like &quot;WOW! Outstanding!&quot;<br />- Buyers are capable of rating a transaction on a scale from 1 to 5 on their own.<br />- I personally think the rating page should display a message stating that an unproblematic transaction deserves a 5/5 if the product is as described.<br /><br />Woops, pretty lengthy. Time flies when you&#039;re having PV.
