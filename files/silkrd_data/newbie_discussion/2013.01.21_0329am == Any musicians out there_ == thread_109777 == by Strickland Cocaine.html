				What do you play, etc?<br /><br />I play guitar, bass, and keyboards as well as compose electronic and reggae music. I&#039;ve been playing for about 10 years.<br /><br />I might open an anon soundcloud so I can share with the community... seems like a lot of work though.<br /><br />Also obligatory spam:<br /><br />decent quality street blow: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/501ad082ff<br /><br />New vendor price.

				Nice. That huge ass Hawaiian dude that ripped on Uke jammed out &quot;Somewhere over the Rainbow&quot; before he kicked the metaphorical bucket. Where else&nbsp; are there Ukelele in mainstream recordings though? Nothing is coming to mind.<br /><br />What kind of music do you play with your bass? Funk, rock, and reggae here.

				Singer Songwriter and mediocre guitar player reporting in.<br /><br />Good to see that there a bunch of fellow musicians out on the Road.<br /><br />They can take you money they can take your freedom, they can even take you dog but one thing nobody ever can take you away is the music that enlighten your soul. Even locked away behind the thickest bars and buried into the deepest pit, the music stays where it fits.<br /><br />-Peace over-

				I play keys, guitar, bass, drums, vocals.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Got a basement studio with a workstation for each instrument.&nbsp; &nbsp;Love recording and having band buddies over jamming.&nbsp; <br /><br />For everything mic&#039;d up through a usb mixer and into a powermac dual g5.&nbsp; Got the complete Native Instruments Suite with Apple Logic Pro for recording. <br /><br />Software synths and software amplifier simulator software is pretty cool these days.&nbsp; Guitar Rig Pro has all your Amps and effects.&nbsp; I even use a software bass amp now too.&nbsp; I patch the guitar into a small 6 channel mixer as. Preamp , then that into the audio port on the power Mac g5 and into the software recording suite , or just live jamming.&nbsp; <br /><br />The mixer has USB audio in and out as well.&nbsp; I also got a FireWire recording rack as well as optical audio into my Yamaha Audio Power amp and speaker system.&nbsp; &nbsp;So the whole band is playing live through the house sound system with crystal clear stereo sound.&nbsp; <br /><br />We produce master tracks that are very professional quality.&nbsp; The days of &#039;hitting the studio&#039; are over.&nbsp; Everybody can and should have a home studio by now.&nbsp; The gear is cheap and unbelievable quality.&nbsp; You can setup in any decent room with good mics.&nbsp; <br /><br />This whole rig cost under $10,000. Excluding the instruments. My wife loves that I&#039;m home and it was a good investment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone comes over to jam and record.&nbsp; I even take it all outside and in the garage. It&#039;s portable.&nbsp; <br /><br />For drums, I use a Yamaha DTX electic drum kit.&nbsp; It has built in sample sounds that are fantastic. The drum heads are touch sensitive and very realistic.&nbsp; I also have a program called &#039;Battery&#039; from Native Instuments that uses a electic drum kit via the USB port into the computer.&nbsp; The software has thousands of drum kits and sounds&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; Real love samples of real live drums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Too cool.&nbsp; I even make up my own kits. <br /><br />I hope I can jam with some of you guys soon!&nbsp; &nbsp;Can we have an anonymous jam session via Skype or something ?&nbsp; Jamming over the Internet is quite fun guys.&nbsp;
