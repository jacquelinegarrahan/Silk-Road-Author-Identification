				Hey for any of you in the know about acid. How long does blotter stay good for? I keep it in airtight bags in a jar that is in the freezer. So far its lasted a long time almost a year. Has anyone stored blotter for a long time? I know a fair bit about the chemistry, but I&#039;d really like to hear about data of how long its lasted for some.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that it gets weaker the older it is, but thats probably it oxidizes or a room temp is will slowly epimerize.<br /><br />Thoughts....basically this threat is to help acid heads noobs to get to 50 posts. Talk anything cool about acid.

				Oh hell yea. On my first trip I was think about art. I imagined that everyone is busily running around painting their life, but I felt like I was able to step out of my painting and see the glory of it all. Then I began to see that even a bum life painting is beautiful. What I noticed though was that just by viewing a bum&#039;s life as a painting all the despair and sorrow a bum would be immersed in was beautiful. Thats when I realised that sadness is only beautiful in art. In real life a bum is just very negative.<br /><br />How did you get your acid at EDC? Did you drop it like in a crowd of people? That would be totally nuts. I went to autozone when I was coming up on a tab (I was working on a car with my friend) and I was massively creeped out. My friend was going ballistic just pointing at all the different motor oils on the shelves and laughing like a mad man.

				I&#039;ve read about LSD being stored in such a way and lasting &#039;for a couple of years.&#039; No personal experience in storing it that long though, so sorry if hearsay isn&#039;t much help.<br /><br />As for the chemical itself though, it&#039;s my number one favorite. Had led me to some very beautiful experiences in my life.

				With blotter acid limiting exposure to UV light is going to be most critical. That will degrade it faster that exposure to oxygen or evaporation alone. Some art aficionados who collect blotter art will intentionally expose their sheets to high frequency light in order to make their collections legal.

				I keep hearing about LSD. When people talk about it I can see in their eyes how much respect they have for it. <br /><br />One time someone brought it up and how great it was. I would have never expected this person to be into these kinds of things but I should not have been surprised because of their age. They were part of the time when it was everywhere and it was not criminalized. When this person told me how great it was I saw them staring off into space. I could see it in their eyes that they were looking at something I could not physically see. Even though we were both there in the same room with the same physical objects around us I just could not see what they were seeing at that moment. I saw it in their eyes that they mean it when they said it was great.

Especially if the rest of the crowd is on acid, and there&#039;s something keeping you all focused (eg EDC). I really pick up on the fun everyone&#039;s having, and how everyone is here just for the purpose of having fun. Happy thoughts.

				&nbsp;I only buy hallucinogens and acid has to be my favourite.<br />I store mine in tin foil, sealed bag and then put it in an air tight container in a dark cupboard.<br />Some people automatically assume you have to put in the fridge or freezer but there have been multiple tests of blotters and liquid, that have been stored at different room temperatureâ€™s for years without losing potency.<br />I just love the euphoric buzz 3 tabs from a star vender gives the mind.<br /><br />My favourite and not so favourite tabs and liquid so far:<br />&nbsp;strawberries from( FLYING DUTCHMENS) mixed with (JORS) lotus tabs gave awesome visuals.<br />(TESSELLATEDS) incredible blotters were clean with absolutely no body load.<br />5 of (JERSEYCOWS) avatar was super strong and gave me my first bad trip, however when re dosing just 2 the visuals and euphoria was superb.<br />(SUBTICKLES) acid is definitely good clean L.s.d,<br />&nbsp;MAHAKALAâ€™s raspberry candy were a good clean high.<br />(LUCYDROPS) blotters were without a doubt low dosed blotters which just changed the perception of reality a little.<br />(JERSEYCOWS) new Smileys were nice and euphoric with no noticeable comedown.<br />(Liquid)<br />(JORâ€™s) (CHRIST XTAL TOC VIAL 80-90% PURE) Took 5 drops and was really disappointed, there was no euphoria,&nbsp; come up was intense with some visuals which made me drowsy, I had an aching body load all night and had to lay down, it had a very earthy feel to it, more like the dried 6 grams of Psilocybe Cubensis I took a few weeks before. I had really high expectations for (JORS) liquid which everybody else praiseâ€™s. I will take just 2 drops next time and hope to have a better experience.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;I work in a lab, have training in organic chemistry, bioengineering labs, chemical engineering, and advanced physics (p Chem). I know I am storing it properly out of light, cold temps, very little air exchange.<br /><br />Even though I know all this shit, I still don&#039;t know how long it stays good for in those conditions. If I could study LSD in the lab I work in I could very well just put it in various conditions and then test its viability over time. That data just doesn&#039;t exist. Like I said Its lasted a year under those conditions.<br /><br />So for anyone wondering, you need to put the blotters in a tiny plastic bag, wrap that with tin foil to keep excess light out. Then inside a bigger freezer protective bag, then inside a jar. Finally, put it in the back of your freezer. It will last a year. <br /><br />I think the road is really the best thing for LSD, because unless you live in California or in certain parts of Europe like the UK or The Netherlands, the good stuff is hard to come by.

				I&#039;m saying that its very hard to find, probably for many people, in many areas, or certain social groups. The road basically offers anyone who is motivated enough to learn about Tor, Bitcoin, etc to get something that they probably can&#039;t find. Besides I think learning about Bitcoin and Tor are going to become very important things to learn anyway, because its clear that there is a general movement to control the internet.

				Anyway, back to LSD. I saw a really good National Geographic documentary called inside LSD a few years ago. (can be found on YT) The program featured a scientist who said that in his experiment he would show patients pictures of faces that were concave and convex. <br /><br />He found that normal folks could only guess it right around half the time, so they couldn&#039;t tell. The schizophrenic group were much much more successful, I don&#039;t remember exact numbers. The third group were people on LSD. They could make guesses as accurate as the schizophrenic group! <br /><br />This is cool not only because it models schizophrenic behavior, but it showed that it improved the perception of average people.<br /><br />The thing I&#039;ve been wanting to answer for a long while is how could the power of LSD be harnessed?? What activity would being more perceptive be a huge advantage? Maybe there is something that taking LSD would help enough to be considered a performance enhancing drug. I&#039;m sure the dose would also be a factor here, like maybe half a hit would be enough to gain some improved perception, without tripping to hard to where it would start to impair the activity.

Someone who is really chill, and won&#039;t say weird shit to you or fuck with you. Make sure its in a house that the other people are either aware of what is going down (and cool with it), or preferably will be absent. For me I try to stay indoors, then I can listen to music, and I tend to get thirsty I can get water, eat oranges etc. I know someone who is a professional music producer so I go to his place to blast the chemical brothers - come with us album. I highly recommend that album its literally like a tutorial music experience for acid trippers. The last song has lyrics like &quot;did I pass? did I pass? the acid test...Yes I did...&quot; Game of thrones is also super epic on acid LOL.<br /><br />I have had a really really bad trip before and it was because people were asking me to go do things, and telling weird false stories on purpose for their entertainment. They don&#039;t know what acid is like, they assumed it was like a weed high and that when I didn&#039;t help them with their shit, they got vengeful. Even though I had like a full mental break down, I&#039;m still thankful for it. After that experience I felt like I was much more mentally tough. <br /><br />Make sure to plan it out a bit, but don&#039;t make your plans too crazy. Like have one or two people preferably in an empty house or if you go out you trust them to act as a buffer. Its also really good if they will go on a walk in a nature park with you. Natural settings are really interesting and relaxing.

These people are had to find. When I went on the hunt for acid I started with people who were keen on mushrooms. I figured they would know someone. Eventually I did find someone who knew someone who had some. Its just a lot of work, like you have to have your friends ask their friends who in turn ask their friends. Its like a cold war military game haha.<br /><br />So we are all lucky that the road exists. I think acid is probably the best thing for the road. Is very small easy to hide, odorless so dog can&#039;t smell it, its also rare enough to justify payout to have someone send it to you. The road also makes a competitive market so that the best quality will rise to the top. If you are trying to get some in your city, you don&#039;t really have a choice is what they have or nothing.<br /><br />Speaking of where the internet is going with Tor, Bitcoin, and the road. You all should check out this Vice episode on youtube just type in the key words: print gun vice. There is this 25 year old dude in Austin Tx, who prints 3d gun parts out of plastic that actually fire! His whole stance is that the internet moves so fast that gun laws are pointless. He distributes the files to print various gun parts so that if yo have access to a 3D printer you could make a gun. He give the files away for free, and he wants them to be torrented in countries that have banned guns. Pretty interesting stuff. I think its kind of a preview of where the internet is going.

I don&#039;t know your situation, but I like acid soo much, and when I look at buying a vial of liquid or something I think I would rather put that money toward buying Ron Paul&#039;s guide on how to make it. He will also hook you up with a type of ergot fungus that only produces the Lysergic acid amide, the one ergotamine that you need. If you were to make your own acid, and you had collected enough ergot to extract the ergotamines you would need to do HPLC or some Thin layer chromatography to separate out the lysergic acid amide. He will also set you up with suppliers of reagents, and offer help. I think that for a thousand bucks that might totally be worth it, if it suited you.<br /><br />Its also one of those drugs that don&#039;t have a high potential for abuse like you could buy a lot of it and store it for a rainy day. Mine has lasted a year the way I store it, so that it also an attractive aspect.

Make sure its in a house that the other people are either aware of what is going down (and cool with it), or preferably will be absent. For me I try to stay indoors, then I can listen to music, and I tend to get thirsty I can get water, eat oranges etc. I know someone who is a professional music producer so I go to his place to blast the chemical brothers - come with us album. I highly recommend that album its literally like a tutorial music experience for acid trippers. The last song has lyrics like &quot;did I pass? did I pass? the acid test...Yes I did...&quot; Game of thrones is also super epic on acid LOL.<br /><br />I have had a really really bad trip before and it was because people were asking me to go do things, and telling weird false stories on purpose for their entertainment. They don&#039;t know what acid is like, they assumed it was like a weed high and that when I didn&#039;t help them with their shit, they got vengeful. Even though I had like a full mental break down, I&#039;m still thankful for it. After that experience I felt like I was much more mentally tough. <br /><br />Make sure to plan it out a bit, but don&#039;t make your plans too crazy. Like have one or two people preferably in an empty house or if you go out you trust them to act as a buffer. Its also really good if they will go on a walk in a nature park with you. Natural settings are really interesting and relaxing. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the advice. I will follow it right down to the Chemical Brothers music :)<br /><br />Looks like I need to call up my ex girlfriend. She&#039;s about the only person I can completely trust not to mess with me if I start wigging out. <br /><br />I really want to go to a park while tripping but I live in the middle of a huge city so any park I go to will be full of people. I can imagine that being stressful.

I saw a really good National Geographic documentary called inside LSD a few years ago. (can be found on YT) The program featured a scientist who said that in his experiment he would show patients pictures of faces that were concave and convex. <br /><br />He found that normal folks could only guess it right around half the time, so they couldn&#039;t tell. The schizophrenic group were much much more successful, I don&#039;t remember exact numbers. The third group were people on LSD. They could make guesses as accurate as the schizophrenic group! <br /><br />This is cool not only because it models schizophrenic behavior, but it showed that it improved the perception of average people.<br /><br />The thing I&#039;ve been wanting to answer for a long while is how could the power of LSD be harnessed?? What activity would being more perceptive be a huge advantage? Maybe there is something that taking LSD would help enough to be considered a performance enhancing drug. I&#039;m sure the dose would also be a factor here, like maybe half a hit would be enough to gain some improved perception, without tripping to hard to where it would start to impair the activity.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can anyone think of an activity that would benefit from the use of LSD, in terms of enhanced perception? I was thinking that maybe a half a hit while playing poker might help. You might be able to pick up on certain subtle behaviors of the other players. The same researcher in that segment of the documentary was asserting that your sub conscious mind filters out all the raw data and connects it to previous concepts you have learned before you conscious mind is needed for processing. He gave the analogy that if something flew by your head very fast your instantaneous reaction is that it could be dangerous. When you get to see what the object was and you see it was a humming bird then that little bit of info that your conscious mind was able to categorize made you realize there was no danger and you could calm down.<br /><br />Where would it be an advantage to be in contact with that raw incoming data that was not connected to preconceived notions?

				The problem with using LSD as a facilitator for activities that may benefit from more attention to &#039;raw data&#039; is that the processing of more data occurs at the expense of other executive processes- while you can attend to more data, your selective attention is likely going to be reduced. That&#039;s how I feel on LSD, at least, and it&#039;s what my knowledge of cognition leads to me predict. Perhaps I should do some empirical trials next time and report on them to you guys.

				I went digging through some journal publications. Many of the studies on LSD are of course being done with cluster headaches, PTSD, and terminally ill cancer patients. There isn&#039;t too much to be found, probably because its impossible for research groups to get permission to work with it.<br />Even Dr. Nichols at Perdue is restricted to animal models.<br /><br />I then went to the MAPS website, and Dr. James Fadiman is doing some anecdotal studies with &quot;micro dosing.&quot; This is where people (of course) supply themselves, and measure out a dose of 10ug (micro grams) taken for as long as they want and report the results.<br /><br />This sounded super interesting! I read a few of the reports from the self administered subjects and the general consensus was that a dose of 10ug, created a day where &quot;everything just clicks&quot; like a day where everything is coming off well, and you are engaged and happy. Some of these people have been micro dosing for weeks and weeks saying that it was so good they saw no down sides and no reason to not just keep doing it. Apparently, Albert Hoffman did this all the time, and he said it was the most under estimated and under researched area of psychedelics.<br /><br />Sounds pretty cool. Micro dosing sounds really interesting I wonder how 20ug would fair?&nbsp;

				If you google: James Fadiman, MAPS, Micro Dose, it should bring it up for you.<br /><br />I was reading a little on how they did this. You need to get water that is distilled (needs to be chlorine free). Then you can drop in your aqueous or even blotter, because LSD is water soluble.<br /><br />So as I do in the lab when making dilutions we use the basic algebraic formula from general chemistry:&nbsp; C1V1=C2V2 this simply means C1 is concentration 1. V1 is the volume of liquid for C1. Same for C2 and V2. Keep in mind you might need a graduated cylinder or pipet to measure out the water accurately. <br /><br />So for example, if you bought 1 100ug blotter. I would just drop it into 100ml of Cl free H2O. That way it would be 1ml per 1ug. Fill up a dropper or medicine cup with 10 ml of your mixture and viola!<br /><br />This would really depend heavily on how accurate the seller is with their advertisements on the concentration of their product is.

				Time to pump some lifeblood back into this thread...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to move to the topic of if enough research was done to show that psilocybin and LSD did have medicinal value to the average person, would it eventually be lowered from a schedule 1 drug?<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve been prescribed SSRIs and they suck zoloft, elavil. They are ok for a day or so but after that your physiology keeps anticipating a drop from this feeling. When these emotions don&#039;t stop you get really weirded out after awhile. Also those SSRIs kill your libido. I took the hard row to hoe and instead started eating really well, working out etc all that plus mushrooms and LSD really had a major positive influence.<br /><br />I remembering trip sitting for some people I knew who were in an emotional rut for a long time. They were loosing their sense of humor and were generally miserable. After their trip they both started eating a lot better, taking time to relax more, started going out and doing more, one of them suddenly out of no where got really serious about loosing weight and lost like 40 lbs!<br /><br />There was a study at Harvard medical where the subjects were not terminally ill patients, but regular folks (very rare in the USA). In Germany testing LSD on individuals is slightly more common.<br /><br />Do you think given enough research and thoughtful presentation that Psilocybin mushrooms and LSD could be available through a medical type program?<br /><br />What do you think would happen if these things became decriminalized with in the course of 2 years, how do you think that would change the culture?<br />

				Hey can you guys share your experiences with who you have bought acid from on SR?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a decent amount of the Avenger&#039;s review. The problem is I don&#039;t see many of those seller selling L on the road. <br /><br />How good is: FredtheBaker, HollandOnline, PremiumDutch, Synaptic, EJDirect, HEADSHOP<br /><br />I want to buy from 3jane because I heard that he/she has very good quality and is reasonably priced with good stealth. They don&#039;t have any L listing and are expecting more in may or june. I might just wait.<br /><br />Has anyone found true needlepoint being sold on SR?

I too have had a super bad trip, like my worst nightmare occurring while I was awake. When I look at why it went bad it was pretty obvious. I neglected all the rules. <br /><br />I decided to do it spontaneously, I also did it around many people who think an acid trip is slightly stronger than a weed high, When I was coming up I went to an auto parts store. A neighbor lady came up to my house and she started hitting on me, but she is much older and she creeped me out massively. I was also trying to help save a plant that was almost dead and while fucking around with the hose my other neighbor (who is a cop) came out and was watching me struggling to water this plant. I did see the lunar eclipse while tripping balls, that was epic!<br /><br />Basically if you are planning a trip make the plans easy to follow, and do it with a sitter who is a chill person. Hopefully someone who has tripped before or who actually cares. Just make a plan to while coming up turn off all stimulating devices, and put on some chill music. Once you are at crusing altitude then go to a nearby natural area if you can. Parks can be difficult because there will be many people there.<br /><br />I think the heavy trips are probably the most fun. I think you will know when you&#039;re ready for it.

				Yo! I survived! Had an epic time too. <br /><br />So, micro dosing is suppose to be in the range of 10 to 15 ug (micro grams)<br /><br />So I thought ok well my L is pretty good.

I too have had a super bad trip, like my worst nightmare occurring while I was awake. When I look at why it went bad it was pretty obvious. I neglected all the rules. <br /><br />I decided to do it spontaneously, I also did it around many people who think an acid trip is slightly stronger than a weed high, When I was coming up I went to an auto parts store. A neighbor lady came up to my house and she started hitting on me, but she is much older and she creeped me out massively. I was also trying to help save a plant that was almost dead and while fucking around with the hose my other neighbor (who is a cop) came out and was watching me struggling to water this plant. I did see the lunar eclipse while tripping balls, that was epic!<br /><br />Basically if you are planning a trip make the plans easy to follow, and do it with a sitter who is a chill person. Hopefully someone who has tripped before or who actually cares. Just make a plan to while coming up turn off all stimulating devices, and put on some chill music. Once you are at crusing altitude then go to a nearby natural area if you can. Parks can be difficult because there will be many people there.<br /><br />I think the heavy trips are probably the most fun. I think you will know when you&#039;re ready for it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the tips man.&nbsp; Yeah, the worst part about my trip was that I thought if I moved I would die.&nbsp; There was extreme body anxiety, and when I breathed I felt like my lungs were giant balloons expanding massively.. I would breathe deeply but felt like I was getting no oxygen.&nbsp; Time basically stopped and I thought the room I was in was the only one in the universe (which I&#039;d felt before, but it wasn&#039;t scary before).&nbsp; I have no idea how much I took, it was half a gel tab but don&#039;t know the dose (this was 10 years ago).&nbsp; We waited 2 hours and nothing happened so we thought it was bunk, so we smoke some dirty weed.&nbsp; It hit me hard and didn&#039;t stop from there.&nbsp; I now know it was the weed, set and setting that caused the bad trip.<br /><br />The come down was beautiful though, and I only remember bits of pieces of the trip, but they&#039;re strong memories.<br /><br />Your tips are pretty similar to what I was planning.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m gonna put on a blindfold and listen to classical music for the come-up, then have a couple options to choose from, the first option to go outside and explore, but I also want to have a comfortable spot in my apartment. <br /><br />I have a friend who will keep an eye on me, he&#039;s chill and understands, but he doesn&#039;t understand the power of set and setting enough.&nbsp; He wants to trip with me.&nbsp; He&#039;s had a bad trip before, so I&#039;m worried if I trip with him, he might not be able to handle it, and that might send me down the wrong path as well.&nbsp; Right now he&#039;s my only option though.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s the biggest trip you&#039;ve taken?&nbsp; Is it different after you&#039;ve had a bad trip?&nbsp; Do you feel more empowered to handle it?&nbsp; Or does it still freak you out sometimes?&nbsp; I think you&#039;re right though, that I&#039;ll know when I&#039;m ready.

				Thinking about hopping back onto the acid train after a long holiday.<br /><br />Recently had a fantastic mushroom trip (300 brewed between two of us) which reminded me how much I love (d) tripping. Used to really love my acid way back in the mid/late 80&#039;s but haven&#039;t had any for over 15 years now. Was always fond of nice high doses, small doses used to leave me anxious - high doses totally ecstatic!

This dose will be effective but not overwhelming. Personally I am much more likely to have a great time on high doses where there is no chance or point in &#039;fighting&#039; (however subconsciously) the effects; but that is just my personal reaction and as there is no way of predicting yours it&#039;s best to begin with an effective but low-ish dose.<br /><br />Get your set and setting spot on. You don&#039;t want to be having to worry about being disturbed by anyone or anything. You need a comfortable, private environment, and access to music of your choice. Make sure you have everything to hand that you could possibly need, smokes, hash, art materials, instruments, creative/meditative kinda stuff...whatever floats your boat. Remember that an acid trip can last 8-12 hours and plan for that. You will need to sleep well after your trip, so make sure you have plenty of time for that. I would advise having some benzo&#039;s (valium etc) around as a &#039;safety net&#039;, or just for chilling at the end of your trip.<br /><br />You might want to consider having a &#039;sitter&#039; if you intend to trip alone - somebody you&#039;re uber-comfortable with who preferably knows the score with acid. If you plan to trip with friends then ideally the same criteria. would apply.<br /><br />Reduce the likelihood of chaos - increase the likelihood of deep-chill, and you should be good to go.<br /><br />Welcome to psychedelia - enjoy!<br /><br />LSD is totally different to anything you have taken before..

				Recent updates to the micro dosing experiments.<br /><br />Last time I took a blotter and cut it into quarters and the quarter hit was about that of maybe 2g of mushrooms. So still pretty strong, but mild enough to where you could still do a lot. I&#039;d also say that it was a good mix of inside your headedness to being present to the moment. Being around people I didn&#039;t know was pretty uncomfortable. When you look into their eyes its like looking into the eyes of a wild animal. Their ignorance to your current state makes you feel vulnerable.<br /><br />Yesterday I took an eighth of a hit. I didn&#039;t think it would do anything, but yet again I was wrong. When I sensed it starting to work its magic, I was completely outside of my own head. Very present to the moment, no internal dialogue of thoughts. Comprehending problems while in class or office hours was a bit hard to do, because I couldn&#039;t get inside my own head to work the problem. Interacting with students, and professors was really awesome. With everyone I talked too it was effortless and never started with tedious small talk about the weather. The conversations were authentic and real. I could tell people really enjoyed talking with me. What was really crazy was that since I was very &quot;in the moment&quot; whoever I talked to I pulled them into the same present moment too. It was one of those days where everyone you meet instantly becomes your friend.

				I&#039;ve always wanted to do LSD but i don&#039;t feel like i have a good handle on normal reality yet. I&#039;ve been told if you go venturing into alternate realities without a good grasp and comfort level with this one, you&#039;ll have a bad time.

				Store in foil in a dark cool place. Do not put in the fridge as you might get condensation. <br />Liquid last longer. WoW and blotter stays good for quite a while kept in the right conditions. <br />
