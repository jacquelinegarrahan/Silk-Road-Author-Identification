				You shouldn&#039;t use the lowest speed, the maximum speed setting is always the most reliable when burning DVDs. Low speed is more prone to errors.

				To be sure your ISO is not corrupted (or worse, you were victim of a MITM attack), you should verify the signature of the image you downloaded.

				Well you could also just verify the image you&#039;ve already downloaded, maybe it&#039;s valid. Obviously if you haven&#039;t completed the download it won&#039;t work though! :P

				You can try making a LiveUSB instead of a DVD, how I prefer to use Tails.<br />For me it was quite easy and went pretty smoothly.

				Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don&#039;t resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.

				When you burn Tails into a CD, make sure that you&#039;re burning the content of the Tails folder, not the .iso file.

				When you say burn the contents of the Tails folder do you mean after clicking on the iso and burning the &#039;Tails 0.18 - 201&#039; or do you mean going once more and just burning the folders of &#039;isolinux&#039; and &#039;live&#039;?
