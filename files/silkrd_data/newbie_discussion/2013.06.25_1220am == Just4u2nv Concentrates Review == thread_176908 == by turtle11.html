				Hey there<br /><br />I wanted to start a thread on my experience w/ Just4u2nv.<br /><br />So I have tried the girl scout cookie co2 oil as well as their skunk #1 shatter.<br /><br />Both are very nice, smooth, potent and each one has a distinctive taste....you can tell these concentrates were well made.<br /><br />The consistency of the skunk is indeed shatter. Very nice clear gold color. I need to heat up my dabber slightly so I can melt the shatter a bit. I am smoking this with a titanium nail on an 18mm Zob bubbler as well as tube.<br /><br />The hit goes straight to the head; slight face melt/sweat under eyes which is always pleasant, instantly high. The taste is great, nice sweet skunky/slightly hashy taste. Overall the skunk #1 is very pleasant and represents a nice hybrid stone; I will definitely be ordering again.<br /><br />The gsc co2 oil is probably a touch more potent. This stuff is really good and worth the price, no bs.<br /><br />The consistency is great; it&#039;s in the oral syringe so dispensing is very easy and convenient.<br /><br />It is a beautiful amber color and stinks as soon as you release the cap. So delicious. The sweet cherry/chocolatey/lemon/kushy taste dances on your tongue as you hold in the massive dab rather easily, the exhale fills the room with the sweet kush and your mouth waters as the high starts to creep. This stuff isn&#039;t as in your face as the skunk shatter but give the gsc a few minutes and you definitely all over the place psychedelic high . It&#039;s great. Like I said, I believe it is more potent than the skunk.<br /><br />I highly recommend both concentrates, these are the best cannabis products I have seen so far, flower or concentrate (I am new tho).<br /><br />The communication/shipping was all on point very professional no bullshit. Great all around.<br /><br />If you&#039;re into concentrates try out Just4u2nv.
