				You are not allowed to sell via the the forums without a vendors account, trying to do so will result in your account being banned.

				Yep the &quot;too good to be true&quot; aspect is they can&#039;t do it without a vendor account as SSBD says.<br /><br />Don&#039;t PM until he has one, or trust your addy at your peril. There was a clusterfuck of these scams a few months back, where they got a bunch of addy&#039;s then tried to extort the poor schmucks who sent their addy.<br /><br />This is the big advantage of the vendor acct fee, stops alot of scams cos the upfront is too prohibitive.<br /><br />(OP - if your legit, apologies, but best to close this thread and reopen when you have your vendor acct)

				Out of curiousity SSBD are you able to see whether newbs are sending him their addy&#039;s? <br /><br />Hopefully our little back and forth will have deterred them, but it never ceases to amaze me on some that catch peeps out, but I guess we were all naive once (never been scammed out of $1 xD), not even back when I had to ask you where account settings were on the road. Hue. Ah, them finding account settings and newbie PGP club days.<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t, not sure what privileges the admins have though.<br /><br />If people want to send in their information that&#039;s up to them really, you can only do so much to guide people on here.
