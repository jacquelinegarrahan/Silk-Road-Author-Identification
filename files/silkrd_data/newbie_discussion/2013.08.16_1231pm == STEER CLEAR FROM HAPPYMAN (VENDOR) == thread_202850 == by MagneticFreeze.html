				Just got fucked, straight robbed by happyman &gt;:(. I FE on a 14 gram deal which he fucked me on. I go by the name optikai0110 on occasion. <br /><br />So the vendor happyman is a liar, thief, and poser. Steer clear away from this guy folks.<br /><br />READ OUR CONVERSATIONS (to be read from the bottom to the top)<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really sorry about today, electricity in my building went down which left me completely stuck, later found out some chinese guys downstairs where growing weed with stolen electric, police was all over the place and i didnt dare go out there past them<br /><br />il be posting it this morning mate, and il throw in a few extras to make you happy. really sorry and i do appreciate your help &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, I do have the utmost trust in you but it&#039;s just not like for you to completely radio silent. If you said you mailed it. Your word is your bond. Looking forward to tomorrow then. I&#039;ll finish that positive write up for you in the forums. I didn&#039;t have to do this for you but this will help you tremendously. I hope you come to appreciate it.<br /><br />PS a tracking number would be worthless since it was sent overnight. Take care, I am off for the night. The mail passes early here. Thanks for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />optikai0110 Could you at least confirm that this was sent out. I get nervous as you can understand. The last thing you told me was that I would get a tracking number soon thereafter but have been waiting for one.<br /><br />I need you to talk to me man, tell me what&#039;s up. Is there anything wrong? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day <br /><br />optikai0110 Please send me my tracking number ASAP. Also, please confirm that this is on the way, I know you are busy but just let me know, please. I am worried about it not getting here in the morning. Just a simple yes or no. I am particularly interested in finding out how the process went.<br /><br />When I get my goods tomorrow, I will help you out be writing a lengthy review in the vendor&#039;s forum about our overall transaction. I have a degree in Journalism so I could make your name truly shine in the forums to help you drum up more business.<br /><br />If the quality is there then people need to hear about this and I will do what it takes to make sure that you get the recognition you deserve. In fact I already began creating a forum entry detailing the outlines of our transaction.<br /><br />optikai0110 Give me some good news, I am excited about tomorrows delivery. I know I sure as hell bother you a lot but that&#039;s just me. Can I have my tracking number please? Were you able to get it delivered before 9am including signature?<br /><br />Mate I cannot tell you how excited I am to finally have found someone as reliable as yourself. For sure, I will have another 14 gram order from you next week. Starting rather small like this was probably wise on both our sides.<br /><br />Do you know I have a very strict policy against FE. I almost cancelled the order because I NEVER EVER FINALIZE. But something told me that you could be trusted and I decided to go with you because I know from our past dealings, you always delivered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payed for. Yes include it in the meth package. Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I placed an order for the ketamine (1 gram). Can I just finalize the ketamine once it arrives and have it placed in the same order as the meth? Otherwise, mark it &quot;in transit&quot; and I will finalize with you now and you can include it in the same package as the meth. What time are you going to be posting my package? Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day<br /><br />optikai0110 Please, please confirm when you have shipped my product. Just gives me piece of mind.<br /><br />Oh and I have another order for you for a gram of ketamine. Could you squeeze this is in this particular order or would this have to go into another order? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 I&#039;ve finalized both orders by the way for a total of close to $1500 including the half g and express shipping options. Please tell me and let me know when you have shipped my order.<br /><br />I had another question for you. Is it possible to keep ordering 14 gram amounts from you say every week or week and a half. Would you be able to deliver those quantities and that consistent quality each and every time? The reason I ask is because I am looking for a reliable source and I would like to make you my go to guy for this. I am looking for a trusting person, which I think you are just the person who I have been looking for. All I ask is that you communicate with me regularly. I may ask for communication that may seem to be frivolous and unnecessary but this communication is all we have with one another and is extremely vital. If you get back to me like you have been doing, then that&#039;s all I can ask for.<br /><br />Let me know if you can deliver 14 grams every week or week and a half. I might need more than 14 grams, if you can handle that.<br /><br />So could I get you to give me a price on an ounce. Get all that info together for me and I will greatly appreciate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finalized and done. Your turn to deliver some of those high grade shards. Are you going to get a tracking number for me and could you get it sent priority overnight by 9am, signature required. Thanks bro. Now awaiting tomorrows delivery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive accepted the order and its in transit now, please let me know once you have done it, the post office is in front of my house il run over and send it as soon as. cheers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for me to finalize you are going to have to mark the package &quot;In Transit&quot; on your side. I cannot finalize right now because I don&#039;t have the option on the 14 grams order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes il add the half gram to your 14gram order, il give you a total of 14.5 grams, please FE asap so i can post it out to you.<br />sorry about the trouble you had with the vendor and its unfortunate that he placed you on the blacklist, im sure we will have a good business relationship, u seem a genuine guy.<br /><br />please FE, i can post it out next day delivery for you, it will reach to you by tomorrow, many thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a separate issue altogether. This is pertaining to my order for a half gram I ordered last Thursday. Can you please give me an update? Are you requiring FE for that as well?<br /><br />It was supposed to be here by yesterday but didn&#039;t make it. I know you already know this but I paid $20 for first class shipping but it has not showed up yet. You mentioned that you were moving to a new location, do you think that due to the move you might of forgot to mail it? Just wondering because I am flat out. Thanks for your help in locating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check it out. I don&#039;t mind FE but I HAVE TO HAVE IT BY TOMORROW. Can you assure me that you can do this for me? I would greatly appreciate it!!<br /><br />I know exactly how I was placed on a blacklist to begin with.<br /><br />Bro, check out my stats, look at how long I have been a member. Look at how many times I have ordered from you without fail. This should be your guide not some &quot;blacklist&quot;. Please take a look at my statistics.<br /><br />The only thing that has ever happened between a vendor and myself was that I got a package (7 grams) confiscated from (MarijuanaIsMyMuse) out of Canada. I received a letter from the DEA telling me that they had my package and all that jazz. I even scanned in the letter using an anonymous imaging service for him to see. He almost refused after all that evidence to pay me what he owed me according to his refund policies. He eventually made good with me and paid me what he owed me. But that is the only time I ever had a problem with a vendor. Does it show who put me on a blacklist? I would like to know because I am especially good to those who I purchase from because I place myself in their shoes.<br /><br />My apologies, sir for being freaked out it&#039;s just I cannot believe my name would ever be placed on a &quot;blacklist&quot;. If you choose to take a look at my stats, which I am sure you already have, it will show only that one time with (MarijuanaIsMyMuse) I got refunded so it equals a 1% refund rate. That&#039;s it!!! I have spent over $7000 throughout my time here which may not be a lot to some but that&#039;s as much as a nice used BMW for goodness sakes.<br /><br />This is the only reason I have been placed on a blacklist. <br /><br />happyman(94) hi, before we post anything out we do a check on the vendors forum where there is a blacklist, we found your user name on this blacklist, for this reason we would require you to FE before we can post it out to you.<br /><br />its all ready and packaged<br /><br />sorry for any inconvenience and i hope you understand<br /><br />cheers<br />IF YOU NOT HAPPY WITH FE THEN LET ME KNOW AND I WILL CANCEL YOUR ORDER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 Were you able to get it sent off, in time, for a tomorrows delivery? I noticed that it is still in processing. 2 days<br /><br />happyman(94) yes its the same as last time mate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 Do you think we need a tracking number to go along with the overnight delivery? What do you think? Let me know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />optikai0110 Done. All wrapped up my friend. Awaiting tomorrow&#039;s shipment. Will finalize as soon as I receive the parcel. Thanks again for your time with this one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />happyman(94) yes its the same as last time mate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 Shouldn&#039;t be much longer. I am watching it on block-chain take it&#039;s merry time. Also, I wanted to ask you if this is the same shards that I received last week, because those were dynamite my friend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />happyman(94) hi mate let me know when you going to order so i can have it ready for you for tomorrow, im waiting for your order so i can go post office and send it out to you,cheers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br /><br />optikai0110 Going to send the order to you within the hour. Just moving the bitcoins from one place to another. Keep a look out for it. Thanks mate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/073c725d31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mate, we need to get the price correct firstly. You first gave me a quote of $1200. Then $1225, now $1250. But on the link you are charging me $1452. I have the $1250 right now. Can we just go with that, the highest quote you gave me?<br /><br />And I still have not received my half gram package yet from last Thursday.<br /><br />Please get back to me ASAP because I want to place the order today and receive it tomorrow. Thanks. 3 days<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ae999319a9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ok, $1250, i will send special delivery super stealth!!, opoligies for the slow response lately its just we have been moving to a new location and its been hectic as hell.<br />but we are settled and ready to get back to work asap!, when did u want to order??? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to order from you to start 14 grams. I would like it delivered overnight. Could we say $1200 for the 14 grams? I will need for you to create a stealth listing for me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why shipping takes so long with you now. I mean at $20, I am being charged already, whilst still in the UK. This should call for super fast shipping times. At $20 for shipping, I should at least get it overnight!! It was never like ths before with you. You used to be faster with your shipping and responses to messages. I am not trying to be rude at all but today is Thursday. If the same thing happens like last weeks order, then I won&#039;t get my stuff until Monday or Tuesday. This is really unfair. I understand that management has changed but the overall process has gotten slower by all standards. All I am saying is that $20 for shipping is already steep and yet my order comes days later??? Put yourself into my shoes.<br /><br />My order went in at 11:00am and is still in processing. Has this even been shipped?<br /><br />Thanks for understanding and I hope you take this as constructive criticism. <br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paid almost $20 for shipping and it still didn&#039;t arrive today. Should I be worried or just be patient? Thank you and sorry to disturb you on your sons birthday.<br /><br />Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for letting me know but it still did not make it here today. Do you think it will arrive tomorrow? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi , it was posted this evening, cutoff time for normal 1st class post is 3:45pm. same day delivery requires orders to be made before 12 noon.<br />{same day delivery is for the london area only}<br /><br />today was my sons birthday so post did go out a little late today, hopefully it will reach to you asap.<br /><br />have a good day mate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just checking that you sent in my order today? Were you able to send it? I noticed that it is still in processing. If you didn&#039;t send it today, that means I won&#039;t get it until Tuesday. I placed the order at around 11:45am this morning, well before the cutoff and early enough to make it here by tomorrow. Let me know the what&#039;s what with my order.<br /><br />Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and this order is to test and demo your product for quality check for a larger purchase. I didnt want to rush into something I knew nothing about. Thanks for your help. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just giving you a heads up that I just now sent in an order for 2 half grams. I would like it for tomorrow&#039;s delivery (Saturday). See if you can mail it early for me to be sure it makes it here for Saturday. Thanks bro!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />happyman(94) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKE IT $1225 DOLLARS AND IL SEND RECORDED OR 1ST CLASS, WHICH DO YOU PREFER?<br />PLEASE BE QUICK AND LET ME KNOW SO I CAN PUT 14GRAMS AWAY FOR YOU AND SEND IT OUT, SO U GET IT BY FRIDAY THE LATEST.<br /><br />RECORDED IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY AS U WANT IT BY FRIDAY.<br /><br />LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS DEAL<br /><br />MANY THANKS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean $1200? So an ounce would be $2400? You know everything on the SR is calculated in dollars or bitcoins. If you mean $1200, which comes to roughly $85 per gram then I might go for that.<br /><br />If you meant £1200 which equals $1800 dollars which means $3600 per ounce. Then I cannot go for that.<br /><br />Let me know. 16 days <br /><br />happyman(94) the best price is £1200 you cant get better than this right now, really packs a punch! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />happyman(94) mate this is some high grade shards, you wont be disappointed, i can send that out to you no problem, could you please just finalize early please?<br />il send it RECORDED DELIVERY or 1st class, SUPER STEALTH!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 days<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off how much for 14 grams? Gimme your best price that you can go for. I would need it by this Thursday or Friday. Could you do a half ounce for $900? And last time we had a little mix up regarding quality, I don&#039;t know if you remember or not. It had turned out to be non-favorable and you ended owing me a gram as a replacement. All I am asking mate, is that I get sent your premium grade d-methamphetamine and I will become a constant buyer from you, if you can do that. I greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />Let me know,<br /><br />Thanks

				I had been doing business with this guy. I know I shouldn&#039;t have FE&#039;d but he required me to do so or wouldn&#039;t ship my parcel. <br /><br /><br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are finding it really hard to believe that you got the parcel and there was nothing in the box.<br />i really am not bothered about how you think you can screw me over mate!!!, Ive got a lot of people on sr who are my loyal customers who can vouch for my services.<br />ive been here since it started and i will always remain here!.<br /><br />ive sent a copy of your message to sr, threatening me again, to make multiple accounts just to bring my status down!! (big mistake you made mate!!)<br /><br />also if i don&#039;t reply it means i cant reply so please do use some common sense as to why i have not replied.<br />account get&#039;s checked through the day to check for orders, only i can reply to messages, so when i get a chance to i will!!<br /><br />i did say we would come to resolution but again, ur attitude is really unprofessional<br /><br />also i dont think you have read our terms and conditions<br /><br />no refunds on high value items!!!<br />yet im still willing to help you, im now waiting on a shipment which is due in a week, all my money is tied into it, once that arrives i may refund you half the money provided my BOSS says ok
