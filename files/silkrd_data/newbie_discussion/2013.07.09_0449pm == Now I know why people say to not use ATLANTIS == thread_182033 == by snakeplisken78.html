				I got my password and username compromised so that when I tried to logon to sr.&nbsp; It would not let me.&nbsp; <br /><br />They ended up trying to transfer the 5 dollars I had in there but were unsuccessful..<br /><br />Just a warning to other to make sure you got the correct URL and more importantly to not use ATLANTIS at all.....<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t even on there to make a purchase... I was just looking to see the differences in variety...<br /><br />What a mistake....<br /><br />

				Stay away from that place! The vendors are sketchy, and there aren&#039;t many buyers. <br /><br />It&#039;s like a knock-off pair of expensive shoes, they might look good, but you sure don&#039;t feel good using them.

				So I haven&#039;t gone to the phishing site yet, but what happens? You click the link and your info is somehow pulled? You just have to &#039;go there&#039; to lose your info?<br /><br />Or is it only taken when you try to log in? Like you actually have to enter your login/password?

				Looks like a big LE Honeypot to me. It was probably the reason the german vendor PF got busted. Coincidentally he signed up a vendor account over their around the same time LE started investigating him.

				Using a password algorithm helps a ton. Generate different passwords for sites using the same formula, such as a standard part — let&#039;s say &quot;lttp&quot; for our example, a number somewhere (I just used the same number usually but if you&#039;re really into it you can make the number of characters in the domain or something, let&#039;s use 1 here), some symbols (@@ for the example), and the last three letters of domain in all caps (Z3R for Silk Road -- this helps you avoid phishing scams too if the domain doesn&#039;t match your pw). So you&#039;d put it together as lttp1@@Z3R on here, lttp1@@S5Q for Atlantis, etc.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use this exact example, obviously, but as long as no one knows your algorithm you&#039;ve got a strong password on many sites even if one is compromised.

				I love this.<br /><br />But it can be a little bit dangerous as if one your passwords gets bruteforced, and they realise this, it can help them figure out the rest of your passwords.<br /><br />So I guess for added security, you can vary how many of the letters are you going to insert after your password. Or sometimes you insert it to the beginning, etc.
