				I read a topic in a law consulting forum and it is referred to the law in my country and the story is a real practice here&nbsp; . <br /><br />The subject is : &quot;Illegal shipment addressed to my apartment&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />The guy explains this ( I will try to translate it , might have mistakes ) : <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Last week they called me at the customs office and I was told that the apartment in which I live has been sent a letter containing drugs. I did not understand exactly how and what, but they were obviously made ​​expertise. The letter was sent from abroad.<br /><br />The inspector asked me there ostensibly as a witness (that was his argument) asking questions such as what work and what are my mother and my father, he told me something that will provide data of a prosecutor. I want to ask is it possible to form me case and to be convicted of drug possession on the basis of only that they were sent to the address where I live?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The lawyers ( most of them ) told him that &quot;they cannot convict him on possession because there is no way that he has something that has not yet reached him....&quot; <br /><br />Despite this being true , I would not feel comfortable to sit on his place asked questions . <br /><br />Second story : I read about the customs here - they open ( in front of the person belonging to , but sometimes not ) , scanning , having dogs etc . But it was referred to a big shipment ( bigger than a letter ) , contained clothes and other stuff . It was about a shipment from Netherlands . <br /><br />I am wondering do you think that there is a possibility for customs to do the same thing with letters that are from NL and do you think good stealth will help in that case ? <br /><br />About the first story I know you are not here and you are not familiar with the law here , but can you give me an advice ( I am waiting for a NL shipment ) ? <br /><br />I am from&nbsp; Balkans <br /><br />Any information you share here is greatly appreciated! <br /><br />P.S. Forgot to mention that the in the first case there is no name written , only address. He was honest because he asked lawyers for a help , so I am even more afraid about my safety now .. <br /><br />Dzlatev

				Hi Dzlatev,<br /><br />I recommend you read my recent post in this thread here if you are a customer:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154088.msg1074732#msg1074732<br /><br />And that you read this one if you are a vendor:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150653.msg1057268#msg1057268<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you feel uncomfortable about getting a package directly in your country, you should probably trust that instinct and go ahead with some more advanced methods of obtaining product, such as those described in the first link.<br /><br />
