As you have found out, if they do not mark it &#039;in transit&#039; by the end of day 4 then you can cancel the order.<br /><br />Nobody but the vendor knows why they didn&#039;t accept the order, but hopefully you&#039;ll get your order sent out this time.<br /><br />And Happy Birthday! :)<br /><br />Libertas

				How much it takes to confirm varies between vendors, but the average is usually in the 48 hours.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why your vendor didn&#039;t confirm the order in 5 days, maybe s/he had some problem somewhere.<br /><br />The only advice I can give you is that if s/he asks you to FE this time for whatever excuse the vendor can come up with, to don&#039;t do it (this is a rule you should always take in mind, never FE - finalize early - if you can avoid it). Better be safe than sorry.
