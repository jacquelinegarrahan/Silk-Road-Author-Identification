				right uk users, if you got a customs letter to an address and had no other addresses to use for deliveries do you think domestic only deliveries would still be cool? and the seized items were under a false name, to start using another name recognized at the address for DOMESTIC ONLY packages would make it to the door?? thanks for any advice, please provide accurate info not just wild theories on how things may or may not pan out

				Impossible to know for sure but I would imagine there is plentiful communication between customs and domestic royal mail. <br /><br />You&#039;d be silly to continue with that address.

				Personally I would consider the address to be burned. <br />Domestic orders in your real name may still be fine, after all you do still get your legitimate post, right? And Royal Mail are hardly gonna open all your mail from now on. <br /><br />But, that&#039;s just a guess. <br /><br />What we really need in this forum is a serving Royal Mail employee. <br /><br />In my opinion though, you should not use the address again - better to be safe than sorry.

				Hello fellas, I will speak here based on experience and by way of educated guess. <br /><br />Customs - are and are not police in other way. They only give a damn of whats comes in the country and what leaves the country. However when they intercept prohibited items must I say, they in co-op with Royal Mail would inspect and remove the illegal goods and send you the form. However if its something worth their while, they in co-op with the police would probably do an investigation, or better yet observation as they call it. They will know how to deal with the situation as they see fit. <br /><br />I would say currently in the UK we benefit slightly from the lack of co-op between government agencies. <br /><br />Royal Mail - as someone said deals with more letters and parcels then you can probably imagine, I mean we still do or did up to a certain point have some of the biggest sorting offices in EU. Domestic mail, unless really suspicious looking, almost never fails and reaches destination. <br /><br />Now for the educated guess, my honest opinion is your address is probably burned from overseas mail however for domestic your still good. <br /><br />As for another delivery address, my best advice is to find a friend or some sort where you would have access to a house where multiple occupants live. Example, 4 bed house, where people individually rent rooms only. In these instance, the tenants change more quickly then you can count and its a right mess in most cases, but for you this mess is probably the best thing that can happen, as the mail can be in any name and is probably left by the main door and anyone who&#039;s not too nosy on touching other peoples mail, I would say you package would be pretty safe. <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Meerkovo

				Many vendors will find a way to ship domestically. This is generally what people mean when they advertise &quot;stealth&quot;, however further precautions would include receiving multiple packages for the same order. There&#039;s a cost for everything I presume. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Long live the DPR!<br /><br />Progression is the Missio!

				I agree with Darktime. Try a small domestic order, you might find that cutting customs from the equation will be ok. I don&#039;t think RM has the time nor inclination to check all your incoming mail.<br /><br />But an order originating outside the UK, you&#039;re pretty much burned so time to get creative with alternative addresses.
