				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a vendor of cannabis on the road for slightly under three months now. This<br />is the first time I have had a chance to setup my forum account and start to interact via the forums.<br /><br />I would like to say thanks to all my awesome clients. You are what makes this experience worth it.<br />I truly appreciate all the great feedback and positive interactions.<br /><br />Recently, I&#039;ve taken measures to increase my inventory, strain selection and shipping stealth. I am also<br />accommodating custom-orders to established buyers (with respectable stats); additionally, I will be selling<br />BHO (wax, shatter, c02), my famous edibles (read the reviews), hash (very competitive prices) and glass BHO rigs.<br /><br />I am also taking steps to expand my shipping to the UK. I predict I&#039;ll have that setup sometime soon, just having a<br />difficult time purchasing shipping onlineâ€”any help and/or advice on the how to&#039;s of purchasing shipping online (reliably)<br />would be GREATLY appreciated. I will send you free samples for your insights. <br /><br />I love you all. Here is some free hash. All I ask for is that you pay shipping/handling.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/12ca16f140<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />AdaParcel

				He&#039;s a great vendor glad to leave a good note for this guy to get to my 50 posts&nbsp; 8). I ordered a qp of the Satori from him.<br /><br />Communication (5/5): He always answered me within a day.<br /><br />Shipping (5/5): Messaged me as soon as he shipped it and it only took 4 days to the East Coast.<br /><br />Stealth (5/5): The product was vacuum sealed multiple times, but to the point of no compressed weed.<br /><br />High (5/5): Was a very energetic Sativa high with a&nbsp; mild body high lurking up your back. Very similar to the Sour Diesel I had a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Product (5/5) Very crystally fluffy buds<br /><br />The QP was also 3 grams overweight. I would recommend Adaparcel to anybody as he considered the Satori some of his lower grade product so I can only imagine how nice his high grade is.<br /><br />

				I had this listing up for a long time, no one read it or replied so I pulled it...kinda crazy<br /><br />I was really hoping to give away free hash, maybe I should do something like this again?<br /><br />What do you think?

				You&#039;d think if there was anything better than hash, it would be free hash. Unless you&#039;re talking about corned beef hash. I&#039;ve never cared for that too much...

				Interesting timing, again, I must say...<br /><br />And yes, you should do something like that again&nbsp; : _)<br /><br />I would also provide thoughtful, honest, and easily read reviews of our transaction on a good handful of threads if you included me in such a way.<br /><br />...Besides that, I&#039;ve watched your visible listings and have been contemplating an order with you - which I do have intentions on doing and reviewing for the good of all things SR.<br /><br />It appears to be a good move, by the way, to raise the promotional consideration again.&nbsp; Keep up the good work
