				it would be very very unlikely.<br />i have asked a couple vendors their success rate for shipping domestically before purchasing and its like 99%. the other 1% is probably lost or stolen mail. as long as they pack it properly its just going to slide right through without issues. <br />i ship to my address and have never had 1 no show. <br />i like to order only 1 package at a time though. in case something did happen i can just deny it. and i wouldn&#039;t order bulk to my house, just things that fit into regular mail. <br />and keep buying legit stuff online. the more normal parcels and letters you have coming in the better.

				if you are uncomfortable, research your vendor, check his/her reviews.. inquire about their shipping techniques, buy only from people using at least MMB (moisture barrier bags) or preferably metal heat sealing bags.<br /><br />also when you receive your letter don&#039;t open, write &#039;RETURN TO SENDER&#039; an wait a few days if you&#039;re extra sketchy about it :P

				Really your chances of getting caught are slim providing that the vendor practices proper packing and stealth techniques. Shit I&#039;ve ordered stuff before and I couldn&#039;t even find it in the package and at first I thought I got ripped, lol. After about 10mins I figured it out. My point is if it&#039;s a reputable vendor you really have nothing to worry about.

				Same here, including buying things off of private forums for years before there even was a silk road.<br /><br />Changing your name around can get the delivery refused, and your vendor won&#039;t refund or have used a real return address.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be silly.

As has been mentioned, you want your SR orders to blend in with your real mail as much as possible, so keep it small, put your exact address and name, pick vendors with good stealth, and don&#039;t sign for anything. You&#039;ll be just fine. <br /><br />I place small orders from vendors all over the world, (up to about 20 over a few months now) get em sent to my door with my name on it, and have never had any problems.

There&#039;s always an inherent risk, and there&#039;s pretty much no steps you can take to completely eliminate it. Especially changing a few letters in your name, that isn&#039;t going to help at all, let alone eliminate the risk. But chances are, if he uses his real name and delivers to his home address, then yes it will be successful. That&#039;s the point.

				Post office COULD open a package even if it&#039;s under your real name. What&#039;s the point you&#039;re trying to make? Are they going to know every single person who currently lives in the house? if you had friends/relatives/anyone over staying with you for a while does the post office necessarily know?<br /><br />Lets take 2 scenarios<br /><br />Scenario 1: You order drugs under a fake name but real address. Package gets intercepted. the &quot;post office&quot; as you put it opens up the package wears the boxes on their head yadee yaa and lo and behold they find weed. They run a check on the name. Nothing shows up. They come to the house to make a CD. Person knows the order wasn&#039;t a package needing to be signed. Says it&#039;s not for him and no one of the name lives at this house. End, they have no leads<br /><br />Scenario 2: You order drugs under your government name at your real address. Package gets intercepted. the &quot;post office&quot; as you put it opens up the package wears the boxes on their head yadee yaa and lo and behold they find weed. They run a check on the name. Your entire life history shows up. They come to the house to make a CD. Person knows the order wasn&#039;t a package needing to be signed. Says it&#039;s not for him.....but wait its his government name so he says he&#039;s not expecting anything or some other bullshit. That sir is a flag. And if they have your government name linked to your drivers license, bank account, address you can bet you&#039;re going to be leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for anyone who may wish to dig a little deeper<br /><br />The whole point of changing just a few letters is to make it different to your &quot;official government name&quot;, it&#039;s not as good as making a different name by getting some free/fake magazines/letters sent but you do even the slightest bit to disconnect yourself from your legal fiction<br /><br />

Package gets intercepted. the &quot;post office&quot; as you put it opens up the package wears the boxes on their head yadee yaa and lo and behold they find weed. They run a check on the name. Nothing shows up. They come to the house to make a CD. Person knows the order wasn&#039;t a package needing to be signed. Says it&#039;s not for him and no one of the name lives at this house. End, they have no leads</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s not what&#039;s going to happen, though. They&#039;re not just going to give up. And they&#039;d simply look up who DOES live in the house, whether the package was addressed to them or not, and get all of their information anyway. Having a package delivered to Seymour Butts has no advantage over having a package delivered to yourself and claiming you weren&#039;t expecting anything. They both have pretty much the same amount of plausible dependability.<br /><br />So if a few people get pulled over and there&#039;s weed in the car, but no one admits to who it belongs to, they just let them go? No, they&#039;ll arrest the driver/owner whether there&#039;s proof that it&#039;s his or not. Hell, they&#039;ll probably arrest and charge the driver if there&#039;s weed on one of his passengers and he didn&#039;t even know about it.<br /><br />If you think a fake name makes you immune to any prosecution, then yes, you are sounding a bit silly.

Here it goes a little bit deeper and depends on your understanding of common law but I can confidently tell you if a office ever found weed on me and tried to even fine me for it, I would go to court and have that case dismissed. And if he&#039;s laying CHARGES, then there&#039;s a little something called Corpus Delecti and I&#039;d love to go to court and have that officer provide evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the weed is mine.<br /><br />And yeah a court summons for JOHN SMIT is not the same as a court summons for JOHN SMITH.

As soon as you start doing something to MAKE YOUR PACKAGE stand out, you fucked up right there.<br /><br />Most the people you hear about that are 55/55 or 91/92 or some stats like that tend to be own addy and own name (and usually mostly domestic).<br /><br />Using some other address is fine, as long as it is correct for the address. Your mate wants to take it thats fine, since it still is normal and blends in WITH REGULAR MAIL.<br /><br />John Smit instead of John Smith is looking for trouble and will not hold you up from getting caught for 5 seconds.<br /><br />Listen to the people that have been doing it the longest and have been the most successful. They aren&#039;t telling you for their own health, its cos it works for them and the other vet members on here.

Over 55 transactions, ALL sent to my home addy, not even a worry, since day 1.<br /><br />How about this, I personally advise the OP top use his actual address, if not possible, the owner or resident of the addy to be used, MUST know what they are consenting to by allowing OP or who ever to have mail sent to their addy. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes it&#039;s worked for you great. The OP wants to be cautious and not take a risk. If I came to you and said I fear for my life and need a gun, what would you say?<br /><br />&quot;Look dude, I&#039;ve been living without a gun my whole life. Over a million people met, NO THREAT TO MY LIFE. I personally advise you not to get a gun&quot;...I hope that&#039;s not what you&#039;d say. The OP wants to take precautions and I think our job should be to help tell him what precautions he may take. A lot of the times you can have people move in and out, for exxample I order in my cousins name all the time. He was here for a few months then went back to India. Worked out fine so far.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Uhh .. change the name around a little bit? Wtf?<br />OP ... DO NOT listen to this guy.<br /><br />Put your real government name and exact address right on that shit, and get it sent directly to you like a boss. If you put a fake name, or screw around with the address trying to make it seem like it wasn&#039;t intended for you, this is more of a red flag than anything. Postal workers are trained to identify mail which doesn&#039;t seem to fit with the rest, like all of a sudden a new name shows up to an address where they&#039;ve been only delivering to certain name(s) for months. As has been mentioned, you want your SR orders to blend in with your real mail as much as possible, so keep it small, put your exact address and name, pick vendors with good stealth, and don&#039;t sign for anything. You&#039;ll be just fine.<br /><br />I place small orders from vendors all over the world, (up to about 20 over a few months now) get em sent to my door with my name on it, and have never had any problems.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You know how many times I&#039;ve ordered from eBay and the name has been mispelt? I&#039;ve had packages deliver to my house just fine. And I pointed very MINOR mistakes that can EASILY be &quot;human error&quot; either while typing or while listening to the name. It DOES NOT RAISE RED FLAGS. You think a postal worker delivering to 100++ houses a day has the time to remember what name each letter of each address gets delivered to? NO THEY DON&#039;T<br /><br />I will add something to this that I should have added in my first post that could have POSSIBLY not caused this confusion.<br /><br />I always advise before thinking up of a &quot;new name&quot; to go on the website see some magazines etc that have a free subscription and subscribe to them using the name you intend to use. When some of the mags start coming to your house under the name it shouldn&#039;t raise ANY flags, even if your postman carries a supercomputer inside his brain remembering every name and every address.<br /><br />&quot;changing your name can get delivery refused&quot; is the biggest piece of horseshit I&#039;ve heard. All those who are saying it, I encourage you to send a mail to yourself by changing your name around a little bit to make it look like a typing/hearing error and let me know how much of your mail doesn&#039;t make it. I speak with experience<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey dipshit... It doesn&#039;t matter if the name is misspelled or not... If a PI discovers it you will be busted anyway. They don&#039;t even do controlled / signed deliveries anymore.. Just wait for you to grab the pack and LE kicks your door in a few minutes after you&#039;ve gone in... <br /><br />Altering the name at the delivery address is stupid and raises a red flag. The idea is to hide in plain sight. Normal looking mail.<br /><br />Admittedly it is a risk to have mail sent to your house, but no more risky than trying to buy weed on the street. Accept the risk or don&#039;t play the game. <br /><br />The safest route is that the mail looks normal and does not raise any red flags. If you are discovered no amount of fake names, other peoples mail boxes, etc will keep them from nabbing you.

				Shipping to a clean house is always the best idea. I definitely side with real names. Plausible deniability is much more realistic when you have a clean house. You act like someone couldnt get an address and a name of someone and come by to pick up the package before you check your own mail. Those shady looking kids are always hanging around outside your house after all. They probably ordered it to you and take it before you check the mail.<br /><br />Edit: I don&#039;t advise being the shady kids in this situation though. Getting caught going through the mail to grab a package of drugs. No deniability there and a felony to boot.
