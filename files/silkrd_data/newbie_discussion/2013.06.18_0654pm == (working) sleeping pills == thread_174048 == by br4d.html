				Ahoy SR,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for something good that knocks me out when i go to bed. I&#039;ve tried everything possible but legal german stuff is just useless and probably 100% placebo. Could somebody recommend some working stuff, if possible provide vendor name/link.

				If you REALLY can&#039;t to sleep you could try chloral hydrate, a german vendor sells some : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b4996af56c<br />It&#039;s also available by prescription in Germany but it&#039;s very rarely used. I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking it for very long (more than a week) though because it&#039;s really strong and it can give you bad withdrawals. If you&#039;ve tried benzos, zolpidem, antihistamines, etc. in a lot of dosages then you could try that. Most people can&#039;t walk to their bed after it kicks in and just fall to the floor so I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll work. 250mg is a small dose and 1000mg is a big dose.<br /><br />Maybe you can try it out and ask your doctor about it...<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t had prescription sleeping pills before I&#039;d recommend Ambien (zolpidem) or benzos like nitrazepam or xanax or any benzo. If you only had legal stuff, try doxylamine, it&#039;s legal and works pretty well too.

				Look up the side effects of these sleeping pills.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried all natural remedies for sleep(every herb in the damn drug store!) and nytol and all that.. Nothing.<br /><br />I picked up Hash Plant(A 100% Indica strain of pot) and I sleep like a baby almost every night. Helped my insomnia 75%

				Of the OTC/legal/non-prescription ones I&#039;d recommend Kirkland Signature Nighttime sleep aid (doxylamine). It works for me, and is available via Amazon, eBay, etc. <br /><br />I looked at ebay.de and found listings. I would recommend you try those. <br /><br />Some people say you feel a bit groggy next morning, but hey, that happens with almost any &quot;sleep aids&quot;. And I don&#039;t have any after effects 7+ hours taking 1-2 of these. And sleep like a baby. <br /><br />Diphenhydramine is another one, also on eBay, also cheaper than bread. <br /><br />Both of these work better than melatonin IMO, and have less &quot;next day issues&quot; after use. <br /><br />My 2c.

				Doxylamine is indeed the best OTC sleep-aid but it still has a hangover effect, at least for me. Things like xanax, halcion and zolpidem don&#039;t have any hagover effect though so they&#039;re pretty good options. I mentioned Chloral Hydrate just in case his insomnia is extreme, because it&#039;s extremely strong, I&#039;d recommend doxylamine as a frist line, then benzos and if everything fails then that.
