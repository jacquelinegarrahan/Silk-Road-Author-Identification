				Okay, here&#039;s something that&#039;s been bugging me, which I&#039;ve been trying to get answered.&nbsp; Say a vendor gets busted, and whatever stupid reason has your name and address on their computer, after decrypting it from PGP. Considering this hypothetical situation, here&#039;s my two questions:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Are LE likely to come after you, assuming your purchase is small and you&#039;re amongst thousands of buyers the vendor has sent to?<br /><br />2) Can they make anything stick?&nbsp; Just on the name and address, I mean.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Let&#039;s assume for a moment that the vendor is in one state and you&#039;re in another. If you&#039;re just a small time buyer, it would be extremely expensive and resource-intensive for LE to come after you. IMO, you would have to be caught at the mailbox, like with a stinky package. As long as you PGP and order small, you should be fine. Don&#039;t be so paranoid.<br /><br />Do you realize how much mail is sent daily? Unless your package sticks out, it will never be suspected.

				you are asking a very difficult question to answer...most vendors delete sensitive info right away , i have had times where i sent vendors my info a few times cause they delete it so fast...i cant tell you 100% they wouldnt come after you...but think about it this way....the got the supplier....so everyone underneath him is cutoff anyway...they are after the suppliers and distributors , now when it comes to making things stick i mean im sure if they really wanted to they can but it would be a long and extensive process and they rather spend that time after the big fish instead of the dude buying a G or two...i hope this helps man its a tough question to really answer truthfully without knowing or asking someone in LE

				personally, i&#039;d fall on the paranoid side and clean house for a couple of weeks at least, and assume they at least forwarded your info to the local popo who probably have put you on their &quot;watch&quot; list, and that includes a note in the system so that if a beat cop pulls you for speeding, broken taillight etc, he knows to look carefully<br /><br />and i&#039;d assume they&#039;ve passed your info to the post office inspectors office and that they would be watching your mail.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know any of the above would be the case, but damn if i wouldn&#039;t assume it and act accordingly, especially not ordering anything for 3-4 months - maybe order some cheap shit from ebay and see how it arrives, ie opened or tampered with, etc

				I would think the address and name would be burnt, as LE would probably turn this info. over to the usps and any future mailings would be heavily scrutinized.

				I cant imagine why any vendor would keep your information after shipment. I like to imagine vendors, at least the ones that know what theyre doing, are a bit more responsible than that.

				Thanks guys.&nbsp; None of my vendors have been busted btw, this is just a paranoid thought I&#039;ve been having and I&#039;m just gathering info if the worst case scenario should happen.&nbsp; I order domestic so I&#039;m not concerned about stuff being intercepted, I&#039;m just concerned several weeks-months down the line if my details ever got nabbed.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think that as long as I didn&#039;t have anything, LE could do nothing to me.&nbsp; In the land of scones and tophats I&#039;ve always thought that a possession charge needs to you to actually be in &quot;possession,&quot; and they have to prove &quot;guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&quot; Considering I keep my computer clean and there&#039;s no connection between my sr activities and my online activities, and I keep my dwelling as clean as possible, all they&#039;d have was my address and name on the vendors account, which literally anyone could&#039;ve sent.&nbsp; Surely there&#039;s no way they could get you prosecuted on that?&nbsp; Because god help us if there is.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve ordered at least 30 packages in the last year. Some even from the UK. (Buying parts to resto an &#039;80&#039;s Honda)<br />Never once did I have anyone question what was in those packages, even the two funny looking ones I had delivered from the UK.<br />(Britain manufactures the best f&#039;in tools I swear)<br /><br />We can hope the vendors worry about protecting us but fuck it all comes down to saving your own ass in a crisis.<br />The Road is only as safe as you make it for yourself.

				just your name and address on a drug dealers computer doesn&#039;t prove anything. they need to catch you in possession of the drugs to get a conviction. otherwise your defense is just going to argue it out that the address could have been there for other reasons. and lets face it, even on a drug dealers computer, there are still a million other reasons.

				I also do not think that the police would come knocking on your door immediately. If your order was a huge amount then surveillance would be possible

				I agree with most of what has been said so far, its unlikely police will come after the end user unless they suspect you are doing more than just buying a small amount for personal use. It&#039;s not financially viable for the police to go after everyone when they can just cut off the supply and get a much heavier conviction to scratch on their bedpost.<br /><br />Like others have said, you make your own safety, just don&#039;t get complacent.

				Really its all in the Hands of a vendor, <br /><br />Find a vendor that you can trust, who follows the SR rules.<br />I not only follow the SR rules, but i take it alot further to ensure nothing or any trace is left behind. <br /><br />read their posts, rate how intelligent they are. I think its a dumb idea to keep addresses... coz instead of having say one dealing charge from that envelope you are carrying, u have a magnitude of charges trying to explain the addresses that you are hoarding<br /><br />And dont think you are safe because you bought a &quot;small&quot; amount. <br /><br />If a dealer is stupid enough to keep address for NO REASON AT ALL. There could be one huge national bust which will scare the shit out of anyone ever again wainting to buy anything on SR.<br /><br />Best thing to do is keep a empty house, or sent to someone else but never your own address<br /><br />- oz
