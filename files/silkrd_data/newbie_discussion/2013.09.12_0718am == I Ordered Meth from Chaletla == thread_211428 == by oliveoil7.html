				I ordered 3.5 g of meth from Chaletla at around 1:00 am Tuesday morning. It was in transit the following afternoon. I didn&#039;t check the forums before I ordered, and I read a lot of negative comments about Chaletla, saying that her gear was bunk, she&#039;s a scammer etc. etc. Anyone have any experiences with her? Anyways I&#039;ll update on the transaction as it goes along. So far she messaged me tracking info which is really nice of a vendor.

				okay. I forgot to add the 9 digit zip code for my address. I only put down the 5 digits, but it was sent anyways despite her buyer policy saying:<br /><br />&quot;When inputting your address you must verify it on USPS.com and provide the 9 digit zip code if available. Any order not doing so will be cancelled, period. &quot; <br /><br />Now I don&#039;t know if she put my order in transit because she was being nice or she was not even planning on sending a package to me in the first place&nbsp; :o. I&#039;m a little worried.

				I made sure to use GPG/PGP when sending her my address, but I did not send her my personal public key. She claims that she will not communicate with her customer&#039;s unless they send her our public key. However, she still sent me my tracking number! <br /><br />&quot;If you intend on beginning or continuing communications with us please create and GPG/PGP key and send me the public key. Going forward we&#039;re not sending ******tracking****** or having other communications that are not encrypted. We&#039;re all being lazy not doing so and we&#039;re going to fix that for everyone we deal with.&quot;<br /><br />I put the stars around the &quot;tracking&quot;. Chaletla is not going fully through her policies with me. I&#039;m worried that she is just going to scam me. My order should arrive either Thursday or Friday afternoon.

				Good morning! Anyways, the tracking number was not registering through the USPS website yesterday night. It got me worried, but I understand that USPS is really bad with updating their tracking. I checked this morning, and voila! The package is on its way. I&#039;ll update more about stealth, quality of product, etc. when it gets here. Crossing my fingers!

				@drinkNlove I did not FE! I would only FE if a vendor&#039;s buyer-policy required it, but I usually stay away from those vendors unless they have positive reviews. I usually do my research before buying from a new vendor, but I guess I just had a brain-fart on this order. My previous 2 meth orders both came from The Dope Spot. I also had black tar heroin from Purest, #4 stamps from DeezleTime, and 1 gram of #4 from CarlitosBrigante. If you guys have any questions about how any of these orders went, let me know!<br />

I broke a bone and received 5mg hydrocodones. First time I popped 2, I fell in love with them :) My friend introduced me to black tar heroin before I even finished my prescriptions, and I smoked that for about a month on and off. The local stuff I was getting was pretty good, and since my friend had a solid connect, we would get them for $100 a gram and sell it for $20 a point. I had good self control. Only smoked about 2 grams of BTH before our source went dry. I ran out of local sources so I was forced to take a month break from BTH. <br /><br />A different friend introduced me to the Silk Road, and did not take it seriously until his package of 1g of BTH arrived. I spent about a week researching and gathering bitcoins until I made my purchase with Purest. His stuff was good, and I only bought a gram of it. But, I wanted to experience something more exciting, so I ordered #4 heroin for IV. <br /><br />I ordered stamps from DeezleTime. His stuff was good, but his product was the first to enter my veins. I loaded up one stamp worth into a spoon and put I put cooled down boiled tap-water in it. It dissolved with almost no residue so I did not use a filter (I recommend that you use a filter though!). His stamps vary in size and his product is pure, but honestly you get jipped buying stamps because there is no guarantee on the exact weight you will get. **So my advice is to buy grams not stamps.** Also, I&#039;ve actually never weighed my hits, so I cannot tell you the exact grams I used. I eyeball my hits. I started small to test the potency of the product and my tolerance and gradually put more and more into my spoon. <br /><br />**IV gives you the most bang for your buck (provided that you do not buy stamps)** The BTH I ordered from Purest was gone in less than a week, and also, the stamps from DeezleTime barely lasted for me. But my 1 gram supply that arrived _ days ago from Carlitos Brigande (a.k.a. Marlo) is still going, and I&#039;ve been shooting up multiple times a day every day. I still got _ grams left. His stuff is the shit, which is why he sold out his supply within just weeks of opening back up. He has awesome service, but his quality and of his product stands out above all. His stuff has long legs and gave me euphoria like no other. He lists his stuff for only $150 a gram too. **Buy from Carlitos Brigande**

				My order from Chaletla arrived!!!!!<br />Here is my review for him/her: <br /><br />&quot;Shipping (5/5):<br />Ordered priority early Tuesday morning around 1 a.m. The order was in transit the following afternoon and tracking info was given. Got here on Friday. Chaletla gets the orders out exactly how he/she promised.<br />P.S. I love the free shipping all these vendors are doing now-a-days! <br /><br />Stealth (5/5):<br />Stealth was probably the best I&#039;ve seen out of any vendor! Even if my neighbors or roommates opened my package, they would have no idea what&#039;s really inside.<br /><br />Communication (5/5)<br />&nbsp;I usually do a lot of research on new vendors before I order from them, but for some reason, I got a little too excited and decided to order right away. I messaged him about my worries, and got fast, professional responses! Thanks for caring about every customer &lt;3<br /><br />Quality (5/5)<br />First the negatives about the product. It was .1 g short. Whatever! The potency of this product makes up for more than that. My previous meth orders were from TDS, and his stuff is good, but you can tell that there was cut in it. I&#039;m not bashing on TDS because I know he is also a legit vendor. It&#039;s not his fault. Apparently, a lot of these vendor&#039;s sources have been the ones cutting it with fillers that is hard to process out. Chaletla&#039;s is more pure and potent than my previous order. It has a fruity taste and melts fast. A+ on the product man. <br />&nbsp;<br />So far, he is my go to guy on this stuff. &quot;<br /><br />I personally believe his stuff is better than The Dope Spot&#039;s.

				Thanks, oliveoil7. Very descriptive and informative.<br /><br />I, having never tried heroin before, was considering stamps to just test the waters...but if you recommend looking for grams, or more gauranteed weights, I&#039;ll trust ya on it as you seem to know what you&#039;re talking about on the subject.<br /><br /><br />As for the Chaletla. Fuckin&#039; nice. I&#039;ve been considering using CTM as everyone posts rave reviews of their stuff...but people have also HIGHLY recommended Chaletla as well...I&#039;m conflicted. haha. It&#039;s nice to know you got your package quickly, and the quality was awesome. I&#039;ve heard about TDS&#039;s sometimes weak stash, so, being a pretty picky meth user, I pretty much have written that vendor off without even trying. Seems like a good vendor, I just want more bang for my buck. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear anymore SR experiences and reviews when you have time!

Very descriptive and informative.<br /><br />I, having never tried heroin before, was considering stamps to just test the waters...but if you recommend looking for grams, or more gauranteed weights, I&#039;ll trust ya on it as you seem to know what you&#039;re talking about on the subject.<br /><br /><br />As for the Chaletla. Fuckin&#039; nice. I&#039;ve been considering using CTM as everyone posts rave reviews of their stuff...but people have also HIGHLY recommended Chaletla as well...I&#039;m conflicted. haha. It&#039;s nice to know you got your package quickly, and the quality was awesome. I&#039;ve heard about TDS&#039;s sometimes weak stash, so, being a pretty picky meth user, I pretty much have written that vendor off without even trying. Seems like a good vendor, I just want more bang for my buck. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear anymore SR experiences and reviews when you have time!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah Chaletla&#039;s stuff isn&#039;t as strong as the stuff I found on the streets once. That stuff felt like I was also on MDMA, but I think it&#039;s definately stronger than TDS.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn, that&#039;s disappointing. I ordered a teener from CTM Friday around 10:30 PM local time as they have RAVE reviews on their quality and shipping...not to mention their prices are badass (for SR). Still processing with them, but in all fairness, I did place the order late on a Friday night with one of the busiest vendors on SR. I&#039;m expecting it to be in transit on Monday. I&#039;ll update about their quality when it arrives!

				Hello, folks.&nbsp; First post here.&nbsp; Thanks to OliveOil and the others in this thread providing good info.<br /><br />I too have yet to place my first order but plan on doing so sometime late next week.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be tapping War Master, CTM, or Chaletla.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to check reviews right before I order to decide who gets my SR virginity.<br /><br />Would really appreciate you other noobs keeping us updated on how your orders go.&nbsp; I&#039;ll certainly do that myself once I pull the trigger.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s been over 18 months since I partook last (and was never a regular user) so I&#039;m really looking forward to blasting off again soon&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Y&#039;all take care.

				Always wanted to try Meth. Don&#039;t like the idea of getting it from outside the UK though...which is obviously very limiting.

				From what&#039;s being said in this thread, I may give a shot at purchasing from Chaletla or CTM next time. I made an order from TDS, but I have never used methamphetamine before this, so it was sufficiently potent in my (inexperienced) regard. This might sound strange, but I have only taken it orally and in very small dosages. I intend to use it to assist with wakefulness and focus with everyday productivity. So far it has been surprisingly successful and it seems relatively safe. <br /><br />I found the following thread to be very insightful reading: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />Though it&#039;s a little interesting/amusing that the OP of the thread disappeared months back. <br /><br />

I love drugs i can function normally on (dexedrine and opiates so far have been the only completely functional ones). I might buy a point, &amp; have a dig and a smoke just for the experience.

				Well, I actually pulled the trigger earlier than I thought I would, although I purchased from CTM and not Chaletla.&nbsp; There must be a CTM review thread here in the nood farm, yes?&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find one using search.
