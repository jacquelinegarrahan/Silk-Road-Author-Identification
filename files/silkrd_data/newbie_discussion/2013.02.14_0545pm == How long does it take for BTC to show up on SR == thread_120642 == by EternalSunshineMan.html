				Hey guys, <br /><br />Obviously, I&#039;m a newb.&nbsp; I sent some btc to SR about 15 min ago, and nothing has showed up yet.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m certain I have the SR address correct, and its not a phishing scam, as I&#039;ve been going back and forth with the vendor for the last day. The SR address I&#039;m using is http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/. I also copied and pasted the SR btc address that was given to me into my btc wallet to send the money, so there should be no mistake there.&nbsp; Is this normal that its taking this long to show the btc in my SR account? How long does this normally take? When I bought the bitcoins, I literally got them nearly instantaneously, so the fact that it hasn&#039;t showed up in SR is making me really fucking nervous.&nbsp; Especially when I&#039;m trying to hit a shipping cutoff time.&nbsp; Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

				Visit blockchain.info and input your silk road wallet address. This will show if there are any pending transactions in the blockchain for your address. If it is there, just wait a bit for the network to process your transaction and it will show up. My SR deposits usually take about 2 hours.

				If you are in a hurry, SR is not the best way to get your dope :-)<br /><br />It may take longer than that. My advice: transfer your bitcoins before you go to sleep, the next morning they certainly will be there! Also, when SR access is slow or difficult, just keep in mind that there are many very good reasons to use SR, but speed is not one of them!<br /><br />ximp<br /><br />

The BTC shows up in your SR wallet when it hits six confirmations, it might take a few moments after that tho.

				Word!&nbsp; Thanks guys!&nbsp; Its there! I just got really fucking nervous when I got the message about &quot;don&#039;t send to phishing sites pretending to be SR blah blah blah&quot; and the coin didn&#039;t show up immediately. I mean, the bitinstant transcation showed up on my iPhone app literally as I was walking out of the store.&nbsp; So it was totally instant.&nbsp; I guess I should&#039;ve read more on SR before first going to the forums.&nbsp; But hey, at least I&#039;m getting closer to the elusive 50 posts!&nbsp; I just really have my heart set on getting something this weekend (by saturday, going express) so I&#039;m super anxious right now, and want to make sure to hit the shipping cutoff. I&#039;m also at work at the moment, and really should be working right now and not buying heroin on SR.&nbsp; Guess that&#039;s the benefit of having your own office! Ah, the benefits of being a responsible adult... and I do realize SR isn&#039;t the fastest way to go, but at least I don&#039;t have to go into the hood and by some lactose &amp; diphenhydramine dope that doesn&#039;t even get me high.&nbsp;

				This is ridiculous... I used bitinstant to transfer $220 USD into BTC directly into my SR wallet and it has been over 24 hours. the transaction showed up properly on blockchain almost immediately after i got home, and it shows the correct address and everything. i think SR fucked up or something, its on their servers. Anyone else have this problem of waiting for it to show up after this long?
