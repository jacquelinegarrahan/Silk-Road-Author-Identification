				To me, good coke isn&#039;t going to burn my nostrils up, or get me so speedy I start getting so I can&#039;t sit still.&nbsp; Good coke to me isn&#039;t gonna be hard like chalk either.&nbsp; Good coke to me will not irritate my nose hardly at all. Once I do a line of good stuff it should only take a couple minutes before I start to feel it, the numbness will extend down into my jaw and teeth depending on whatever side I snorted the line on, plus the euphoria will accompany the numbness.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have to do tons of lines to get feeling good, just a couple medium sized lines should do for like an hour. Things are very functional with the good stuff.&nbsp; Then the come down should be smooth and the next day shouldn&#039;t be that bad either.&nbsp; I&#039;m still looking for that elusive superior product I once had access to years ago.&nbsp; Who&#039;s got the pearl?

				So true, good coke doesn&#039;t have the crash and burn feeling to it.&nbsp; I hate it when people cut it with speed, thats the culprit.&nbsp; I had some good stuff recently and I did a few good lines, still high, and I&#039;m ready to eat a full meal 45 minutes later.&nbsp; A couple beers, then a few more lines.&nbsp; The good stuff is fully functional, no jitters. Some of the crap people sell these days has so much speed, procaine, inositol, laxative and other crap mixed in, its not even coke anymore, just some homemade cocktail they try to sell as coke.&nbsp; To me thats just dirty.&nbsp; I mean really, if someone has access to bricks or even pounds, there&#039;s no reason to even touch it, just break it down and move it, charging a little more.&nbsp; I know I&#039;ll pay a little more if its really good.&nbsp; Its just greedy people that cut the hell out of shit.&nbsp; Half a brick is 500 grams, at that quality they can still double their money easy without cut. I&#039;ll go without rather than waste my money on crap.

				In the UK street coke is heavily cut with numbing agents, so if you feel like you&#039;ve been to the dentist after snorting a line that&#039;s what it is here, unlikely to be the numbing agents from Columbia. Good coke is slightly sticky and clumpy if you leave it out for too long, it&#039;s not too powdery and not rock hard. It doesn&#039;t give you a limp dick or keep you awake for more than half an hour.

				Good coke will give you a good buzz for 45 mins to an hour. It will come with an excellent come up that just keeps getting better and better till about 30 mins in. You&#039;ll barely feel a comedown and you sure as hell won&#039;t feel ANY need to re-dose. There should be numbing but not a crazy &#039;holy shit I can&#039;t feel half of my face&#039; numbing. You&#039;re just gonna feel exceptionally euphoric and become the life of the party, assuming you didn&#039;t share any ;)

				Good coke to me is the one that has the right chemical composition with a high percentage of the proper active ingredient.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care about subjectivity(cuts) in these matters, or else you might as well just snort Speed or anything else in powder form.

				What I would call the better grades of coke, those qualities weren&#039;t hard like chalk(that would be re-rock), the better grades were somewhat clumpy, not super compressed and not totally white either.&nbsp; Its like an off white color. Inositol can give off a little sparkle so I don&#039;t go by if its sparkly.&nbsp; Usually there isn&#039;t veins running thru that show a different color, that would be re-rock again.&nbsp; Anyone with quality will have a smaller amount to sell so people can see for themselves what their deal is.&nbsp; The truly washed product I tried recently and it wasn&#039;t bad.&nbsp; Anyone paying close to a hundred or more for a gram oughta be getting the untouched product, I know its out there.

				the truth is that most people on this planet are stupid. So stupid, that if they were shown realness, they would refuse to believe it. but hey, what can you do. To all who want to experience the best coke that end consumers can possibly get (people like me), without getting. Then you;ll have a point of reference to which to compare other coke to. cuz you won&#039;t find betta anywhere without getting tagled with people who do not have your best interests at heart.

				Alot of good info on the boards about who&#039;s got &#039;good&#039; stuff.&nbsp; Burning nostrils are a bad sign, no numbness at all is a bad sign too.&nbsp; Euphoria that doesn&#039;t last long but numbness that does are also bad.&nbsp; Some people wanna settle for better than street grade or better than what they&#039;ve been getting, hey, thats up to them.&nbsp; Myself, if I&#039;m being charged premium price I expect the best gear.&nbsp; Good coke is actually quite good.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a couple grams last all weekend just doing matchhead bumps once in awhile.&nbsp; You can eat on it, function, no jitters or tense feeling.&nbsp; The euphoric is just perfect.

				I LOVE coke. It&#039;s one of my favorites!&nbsp; ;D<br />I&#039;m sure I haven&#039;t had any of *the best*, but I&#039;ve had some that certainly satisfied me.<br /><br />The best coke I&#039;ve had:<br />- Has THAT SMELL. You know it&#039;s good right off the bat.<br />- It numbs EVERYTHING. (And you don&#039;t need large amounts to get that)<br />- It doesn&#039;t burn.<br />- The drip is pleasant.<br />- [almost] instant euphoria.<br />- Makes me social, confident, motivated, &amp; interested in my art projects.<br />- Gives me a rush of energy, better than a pick-me-up, but not overwhelmingly speedy.<br />- Helps me rationalize &amp; minimize my worrying.<br />- Overall, good coke makes me feel A LOT better than I usually feel. <br />Actually, I often use alone in my room while I&#039;m writing or doing other activities, and it makes me feel like I&#039;m on top of the world. It feels just as great as having one of the best days of your life, even though I haven&#039;t actually done anything that would make my day great (beside coke. hah.)<br /><br />...that&#039;s all for now.&nbsp; 8)

				I am sure most people have never tried pure cocaine as they have no way of testing it with 100% accuracy.<br /><br />If you are looking for 100% pure coke, purify it yourself via liquid chromatography.<br /><br />If that&#039;s too complicated for you, just do an acetone wash (see LeJunk&#039;s tutorial). Then convert to freebase, take up in chloroform, dry, and acidify w/HCl. You&#039;ll get at least 95% purity with this method.<br /><br />I might consider selling cocaine purified by HPLC (99.99% purity) for the cocaine connoiseurs on here, not sure what the demand would be though.

Good stuff doesn&#039;t do that. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Too bad that type of cocaine is long gone and very hard to come by, unless buying in bulk from the farms/factories that produce it, even then it&#039;s still cut to 95% - 90% purity, maybe even more. For me good Coke is what Pepsi isn&#039;t. <br /><br />~ Cooler.

				Good coke MEANT (I do not do it anymore) a very clean smell with little burn in the nose. A clean quick come up without the speedy, I need to run a marathon feeling. No crusties in the morning when I woke up. and the good numb of my upper jaw and lip without the finger lick.<br /><br />

				The truly &#039;washed&#039; product is very decent.&nbsp; I did a gram and next day I was good to go, didn&#039;t feel like shit at all, no bloody nose, nothing, not bad.&nbsp; The only other one is &#039;if&#039; you know someone that has a brick, in original wrap, and is willing to part with some and it goes from his brick to your hand with no footprints, then that is way worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried different &#039;coke&#039; claimed to be high quality.&nbsp; I could pick up on the speed cut, and the laxative almost immediately.&nbsp;

				Good cocaine has legs on it you do at least a point two line and it should last for close to two hours and you are still rolling and don&#039;t feel like you need another line.<br /><br />The first time I had good coke about two grams was high as humanely possible got some sleep woke up in the morning no fucking hangover that day or the next could not believe it,<br /><br />Obviously even good coke will fuck you up try having 5 grams plus&nbsp; plus plus<br /><br />Safe Lines

				Good coke to me is a chunk that falls out of stretch wrap when a brick is pealed open to weigh out oz&#039;s. Good coke is the stuff that&#039;s in front of the guy with a pistol tucked into his jeans in a vacant condo with a smile on his face, but a bit sketchy looking at your friend sideways, uncertain of his intent (I dont know why he was even allowed there now that I think of it lol). After the big guy&#039;s paranoia is killed, the good stuff is sampled and I could not believe the euphoria I got from such a small amount. The brick crumbled a bit, but it was rock solid chunks that came off. I could have as much as I wanted when I was there, but had to pay $60/g when I left. I would pay $250 for that same fucking shit. Cocaine is lost to me. I don&#039;t want to associate with people moving 5 kilos for a respectable, organized criminal org. any longer, although some links/relationships are always there no matter what you do. <br /><br />Anyway, I like the duration of amphetamines, the clean euphoria, and the positive effect it has in low-doses on my work.

				There is someone that advertises straight off the brick, that it is.&nbsp; Two matchstick size lines and it was like, wow, oh yeah, this is the shit. I&#039;m very analytical when it comes to coke especially, but this shit, someone could hurt themselves if they do just a little too much. Like I said, wow.
