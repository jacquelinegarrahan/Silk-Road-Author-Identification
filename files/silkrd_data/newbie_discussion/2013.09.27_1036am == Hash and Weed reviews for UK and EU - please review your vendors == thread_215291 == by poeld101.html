				Hey n00bs!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Ive registered to SR a year ago (200+BTC 15+ vendors etc etc) and this is only my second post. <br /><br />How come there is no newbie thread for weed and hash for european buyers?<br /><br />ok eurofags, please post detailed reviews about the weed and the hash you bought in SR.<br /><br />Hash is a very complicated matter, and very difficult to judge (bought 5 different hashs on SR and havent find one that matches my expectations) so please put reviews after you smoked at least 4-5 joints of the hash, and only if you have experience in hash smoking. <br /><br />poeld101

				ill start with the first review: White Shark<br /><br />WhiteShark is a great weed supplier from Canada, (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d9819292a9) she has AAA Kush listings. I have been dealing with her for the past 6 months and I must say it is the most trustable vendor you could have on SR: the quality is always AAA, she has a lot of different strains (Kush strains but also haze strains such as Blue Dream). I have been buying ounces from her but when I received a qp a month ago, I knew I was going to buy A LOT more weed from her. This was what I received:<br /><br />Blue Dream (2oz):Perfectly grown (full of thrichomes transparent to resin brown), perfectly cured and dried (sticky, still very fresh in the texture but dry and crispy enough to make a nice fluffy consistency when grinded) and looks great (big green haze buds with blue/purple-ish shades) and of course no trims or shakes, only bud.<br />Very nice aroma, the strain is a cross between haze and blueberry (in Europe we really have a lot a great haze products and even though haze is originally from the US, the Dutch grow the best haze IMO) and i wasnt expecting a strong haze product, but something very fruity with the potency and bud structure of a haze plant. And indeed, the taste is very strong and very nice, you can definitely taste the blueberry/ mango with a little haze aftertaste but not overpowering: its very smooth, very strong and so tasty i kept an oz to myself. Piece of art. Very strong high, very potent as the haze plants are.<br /><br />Purple Kush (1oz): AAA Kush indeed!! It comes out as medium sized, very consistent bud. Perfectly dried and cured as the BD is. This is the kind of purple you want to have: It looks very green, but you can see that the leaves (cured) were purple. This is the best sign for purple strains, you know you&#039;re gonna have potent kush with the fruity taste of the purp.<br />The smoke is thick, very smooth. Tastes very fruity with a strong kush taste on the exhale, its fucking brilliant. This is the kush quality we will never be able to grow in Europe, I honestly have never smocked any kush this good outside US and Canada. And WS&#039;s Purple Kush is what we, Europeans, are expecting when we think about canadian bud. Its very strong too, perfect indica to go to sleep.<br /><br />Bubba Kush (1/2oz): AAA Kush. Classic bubba buds, round medium sized light green with grey-ish shades. Its a great bud, very well grown as they all are, and has a very nice kush taste. Very strong weed.<br /><br />Sour Kush (1/2oz): AAA Kush, she was honest telling me it was the lasts buds of the stock. Small round buds with a dark green color. I smoked a little bit of it and the rest was sold day of the delivery (I wouldve hoped to smoke more of it :/ ), it has a very nice taste and a great high, but I didnt smoke enough of it :(.<br /><br />Overall, the buds are amazing, the high is very potent. When she says its AAA, it is AAA, no doubt about that. They are frosty, perfectly cured, perfectly grown. You know you are not dealing with a first-time-grower but with someone who has a lot experience in gardening and a true weed connoisseur.<br /><br />Packaging &amp; shipping (superstealth express packaging): Do not use another postage option, it is the most secure and the fastest way to get your product.<br />The packaging of the qp, without going into too many details, included 4-6 layers of mylar and a plastic box. It is the best packaging possible, without opening at least 3 layers of MBB, you cant see its weed. Envelope is professional, legit, includes custom declaration. Perfect.<br />Shipping is fast (5 days to Westerm Europe), tracking is reassuring, express priority way from Canada is efficient.<br />If you put your real name, there is almost zero risk that you get fucked by customs.<br /><br />I had an issue at delivery, wasnt customs, but i needed the expedition address, and she did everything necessary for me to have my package. Definitely an honest person.<br /><br />Overall, the price is very competitive for Europe, considering how secure the shipping is, and staying in escrow. The weed is unbelievably good and people are almost fighting for it. Which allows me to double my money.<br />European buyers, it is better to buy from Canada and especially WS than from any european vendor: you wont ever get this price and they are not as professional in packaging as WS. Plus, shes honest and kind.<br /><br />Im definitely going to buy more and more from her.<br /><br />poeld101

				Hi poeld101,<br /><br />Check out the UK Cannabis Buyers Thread. People often post reviews of their favourite vendors for all cannabis products including hash and concentrates, as well as up to date discussion on availability. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298.4150<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf<br /><br />
