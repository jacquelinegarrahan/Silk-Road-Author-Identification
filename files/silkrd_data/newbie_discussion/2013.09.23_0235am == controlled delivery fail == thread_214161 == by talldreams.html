				so i just survived an attempted control delivery i ordered my 2nd shipment of m1 from a guy names tigerrush this time from china due to the price being so cheap <br />long story short my package didnt arrive on time so i got a little suspicious needless to say 2 hours after the normal mail comes<br />i see 3 undercover cars pull up and park in front of my house followed by the mail truck as if that wasnt obvious enough the mailman knocks on my door with sunglasses on and a silly smirk on his face asking me to sign i immediately said no one lives here by that name i knew they had nothing without a signature or a confession <br />DEA agents then jumped out of the car and questioned me for about 20 mins they kept on trying to get me to confess then states they have the ip address of someone who was tracking the package (tor came in handy) so i let them check my ip address on my laptop just to prove my innocents finally after harassing me for about 20 mins they left and i never got my package ):<br /><br />lesson learned<br />definately not ordering anything from outside the US again<br />and use tor for everything even tracking<br /><br />please let me know if you have any questions

				Sounds like you got very lucky, as for the tracking over tor I actually think that&#039;s not necessarily smart. If you check the status multiple times it could be from IP&#039;s all over the world. I would think that would be very suspicious, idk if USPS tracks anything like that or not though.

Everyone says NEVER to track through Tor, it flags you in the system because like someone else said, you&#039;d be tracking it from multiple IP addresses all over the world. Safest bet is to just not track, or if you have to probably track it from a public computer at a library or something.

				Anyway, sorry to hear about this but I&#039;m glad you got away free. Definitely sounds like you shouldn&#039;t order to that address ever again. I made the decision early on to never order internationally no matter how good of a deal it is. Just not worth the risk to me. If you just have to do it though I&#039;d at least use a PO box or something where they don&#039;t have your real address. I wouldn&#039;t order that much of anything through the mail personally, especially from overseas... c&#039;mon, man.

				How much identifiable information was you planning on posting in this thread? so far you have described the op, the name on the order is half yours and the quantity of the order.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know why this is a bad idea I can&#039;t be bothered to explain it, if this really happened you can rest assured you are now under surveillance, you have already posted a confession here.

You need to use a computer that everyone has access to so there is no finger pointing later. I&#039;m not an expert but I think I&#039;m right.<br /><br />Something about this story doesn&#039;t sit right with me. I can&#039;t see LE pulling in front of the house in their unmarked cars. Makes no sense. If it is true it&#039;s probably the worst CD ever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Either way I NEVER order international. Now you have yet another entity looking into your sh!t. May pay more but let someone else worry about the importation. Domestic shipping, if done correctly, is so huge your chances are better. <br /><br />I totally agree with samesame.

				I am confused because standard procedure would be a search warrant and detainment for questioning at a separate facility so that the search could be executed without impairment. <br /><br />I mean no offense if this really happened to you but I see too many red flags that lead me to believe this story is manufactured. <br /><br />EDIT: I have been told by a respected member of the forum that it is &quot;100% believable&quot; so there is that.&nbsp; I still cannot bring myself to blindly accept this in the face of the contradiction of S.O.P. A search warrant would absolutely be served in case of a controlled delivery. Particularly when the individual was also grabbed by LEO.
