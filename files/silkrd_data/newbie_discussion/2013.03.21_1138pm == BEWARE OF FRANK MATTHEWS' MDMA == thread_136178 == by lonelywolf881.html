				hi i&#039;m a complete newbie. I bought my first gram of mdma from frankmatthews last week. He asked me to FE him before sending me the item. I did cause i had no other chance. Today i have received the item. I was so anxious and happy, I tried it. First 0.1 gram and waited. No result. Tried second 0,1 gram and waited, to be sure. No result absolutely. The thing he sent me was total FAKE. I have seen so many positive feedbacks from him, so i thought he was a good seller. I was in error, i just lost about 60 dollars to have some bitter dust i don√¨t know what it is.

				i know you might not wanna hear this but you really should buy a testing kit for your safety and so you can know for sure if you are getting what you are told. Also, never FE, even for a seller with good rep. Just what i think.

				Well you can go in your account and click on feedback given and you can change the feedback from a 5/5 FE to a 1/5 fake product andwrite your review you wont get a refund but it will warn other potential buyers of fake product. Sorry to hear your first order was a scam, my first order i FE&#039;d on 7 grams of molly from MENDICINOMISTRESS and she turned out to be a scammer nothing ever showed so basically it happens to everyone just make sure you dont FE again and you should be good dude!

				Sorry to hear, I was looking to buy MDMA powder but read so many conflicting things about the various sellers that I decided to buy some partyflock and nintendo pills instead, they are apparently pretty close to pure MDMA. I only placed my order about 10 days ago from theheineken and chemical bros so will be a bit longer before I can verify the good reports.

				OP if I took just 100mg of MDMA I&#039;d hardly feel anything either. My first dose would normally be in the region of 300-500mg and I&#039;d take the whole gram over the course of the night. Maybe you have a tolerance to it like myself? I also find other things can stop me from feeling MDMA properly such as taking paracetamol 24 hours beforehand or trying to roll twice in the space of a couple of days. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never ordered off Frank before but he seems to be a big player with plenty of happy customers so I&#039;d very much doubt he&#039;s sending fake stuff out. A weak batch at worst maybe who knows?

				Let this be a lesson to you.<br /><br />Research stuff before you buy it, 60 bucks for a gram of mdma? Way too much. <br />There&#039;s a lot better stuff for much less available, just check them topics. <br /><br />Also; never FE.<br />Seller forces you to FE? Cancel order and buy from someone else, it&#039;s his loss, not yours.

				Thanks all for the answers. I said, this was my first order and i was not so experienced. At the beginning i did not even know what FE meant, for instance. My english is not so good in fact.&nbsp; I took 100 mg cause he said it was PURE mdma so i googled it to know which was the proper dose for a beginner (i never used it before) and everyone said it was 80-120 mg. I will buy (even if i dont know where) a kit to know if there is that real drug in the dust someone is selling me.&nbsp; <br />Altough, i must say that, even in the immediate i did not feel some real effect (i must say it was late in night i was tired and i kept being it, no &quot;change&quot; in the frame of consciousness), the day after i felt a bit drowsy and more &quot;stupid&quot; than normal. I even had some pain in the stomach and i dont have it usually. I am not sure, maybe it was only an impression and suggestion. I am not an usual drug buyer, so i can had suggestion.&nbsp; Maybe the fact i take every day one pill of SERTRALINE (antidepressive ssri) may have caused some change in the effect?&nbsp; i found nothing on the net about this, i found mdma has powered effect with other antidepressants but not ssri class.<br /><br />UPDATING 23/03/2013:&nbsp; &nbsp;my silk road account has been hacked. I lost all my funds. I don&#039;t know how could it happen. I did not receive some fishing emails or other scums. I just entered the website from same ip as usual.&nbsp; Yesterday i tried to enter lots of times and could not, it said &quot;uncorrect password&quot;; i did same today and i went it. But i found 0,01 bitcoins instead of about 1 bitcoin i kept in. Luckily i did not keep in it so much money. Maybe FRANK MATHEWS&#039; REVENGE? Seems a bit strange that this happened the day after i wrote this negative post about him.

The correct way to handle a situation like this is to only bring your beef to the forums and give negative feedback when all hope of resolving this situation is gone, message him, message him and message him again. He is a well established vendor and I would be surprised if he doesn&#039;t work something out with you. There are so many sellers on the road that don&#039;t require FE, there is no need to take such risks.<br /><br />If EVERYTHING else fails though.<br /><br />Click account at the top, then on the right under account links click view feedback. You&#039;ll see your recent feedback, the far right column will have a link to edit.<br /><br />He&#039;s the one of highest volume vendors on the road so requiring FE, this means getting to any feedback that&#039;s more than &#039;FE: Will update later&#039; can be troublesome. Always check the forums, post enough so you can leave a review on his feedback page in the forum.<br /><br />If you change your feedback to 1/5 it will take the percentage down, even if no one will ever see what you wrote.<br /><br />Only do this when EVERYTHING else fails though.<br /><br />You could find yourself leaving the feedback<br />5/5 Slight problem with the wrong shipment but frank sent me the right product and let me keep the other. The MDMA is as good as everyone is saying, brilliant vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a sample on the way from him and will be leaving him a truthful review on the service I receive.

You only use your pin to send funds, whoever took your money knew your pin. There is absolutely no way this would have anything to do with frankmatthews.<br /><br />slikroad vee bee 5 piz3r<br /><br />If you cant remember that go to www.reddit.com/r/silkroad links to the forums and the website are pinned to the right hand side. <br />Never follow the like from the wiki or anywhere else, never enter your pin on the log in screen.<br /><br />It sounds like you need to read some decent guides, that&#039;s three pretty big mistakes and your paying for it. You need to know what your doing before jumping in.

				Lonelywolf, change your password and PIN now! You may have entered your details into a phishing site. If you are ever asked for your PIN at the login page, this is NOT the real silkroad website.<br /><br />In future, research vendors on this forum, it really is worth the time you put into it. Many vendors do not require even new buyers like yourself to FE, I&#039;d try and use these to build your stats up, and then you&#039;ll never have to FE. Good luck on SR, don&#039;t let this experience ruin the whole thing for you - many of us have never been ripped off. I know it&#039;s tempting to dive right in when you get here and you see all the things you want, but patience and research will be rewarded greatly.
