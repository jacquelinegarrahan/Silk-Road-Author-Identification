				I ordered 2 ounces of sour OG from a vendor, and today I got 1 marked ounce of mid grade crap, a bunch of it being shake. I sent the vendor a message telling him, and I asked nicely if he could just refund the other ounce instead of shipping a new one. I have a feeling I&#039;m going to get neither a re-ship or a refund. My question is will I have a case if it goes to resolution? All he has to do is provide a tracking number? Am I screwed? I&#039;m not so much concerned with the quality, although it was advertised as Dank GH nuggs, which they are not. I just don&#039;t want to get screwed out of a whole ounce. Any suggestions?

				The best thing you can do is if you are unsure whether your package is correct is to take detailed photos of the package PRE opening showing the sealed labelled Vac bags and products within.&nbsp; Then photo the process of opening the product and detailed pics of said product.<br /><br />It will help you out when corresponding with the vendor.&nbsp; Already opened pics are useless as obviously you could have tampered with it after opening. <br /><br />Hope that helps and good luck!

				How&#039;s the vendors recent ratings/feedback? If they&#039;re good you might do ok. I&#039;m going to guess that since vendors are just people like everyone else they do from time to time make mistakes, possibly getting what was supposed to go into two boxes mixed up. But if they didn&#039;t realize it then right the vendor might think you are trying to scam them?

				Definitely make your case, if he has done the same thing to others and they have made the same complaint then the staff might listen.
