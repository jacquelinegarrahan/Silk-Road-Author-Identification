				I am completely new to SR &amp; have no clue on where &amp; how to begin. I have found out the basics; i.e. TOR, 50 posts, &amp; buying bitcoins. However, I need direction on what else I need to do step by step. I would greatly appreciate any advice or info.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Try the buyers guide:<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><br />then scroll through the different sections such as security and shipping and read the stickies and look for posts by well respected long time members such as Pine and White Out.<br /><br />PGP is an absolute must. Absolute.<br /><br />Lots of reading and learning to do my friend but it is worth it.<br /><br />Remember, better safe than sorry.

				I&#039;m a newbie as well and I&#039;ve found that there&#039;s a ton of valuable information to be found just by reading all the way through threads in the various subforums (security especially). I have a lot more work to do before I&#039;m anywhere near ready to make my first buy, but there are a lot of awesome users out there posting helpful links and guides if you&#039;re willing to sift through the thread. I would recommend making sure you absolutely have everything down cold by purchasing some books or clothing first and taking yourself through the process before you move onto the drugs.

				No, do not FE. You will severely regret it. No matter how sweet and friendly the vendor seems to be. Pretty please, FE? Just say no.

				^^^ listen to these guys OP.&nbsp; Definitely do not FE(Finalize Early), and make to sure to encrypt your address.&nbsp; Read up on the forums and you will learn basically everything you need to know about ordering. I advise you to research some well known and respected vendors on the forums to make your first purchase from, just my opinion though.&nbsp; <br /><br />And welcome to the road my friend!
