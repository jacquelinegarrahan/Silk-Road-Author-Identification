				So let&#039;s say your package gets seized at customs (like, legit gets picked up at customs - no selective scamming, no fault of the postman etc).<br /><br />Is it worth using the same address and/or name on another order, perhaps like a month later? Or once one package (nothing huge - not a large enough amount to have the cops come knocking on your door etc) gets picked up, is it pointless?<br /><br />I will note that I&#039;m in Aus, and whilst I have not received a seizure letter from customs, I&#039;m pretty sure they generally don&#039;t bother with that...its only worth their time/resources if you repeatedly have packages seized/you&#039;re ordering enough to be considered trafficking/worth sending the cops around.<br /><br />And I have reason to believe that this was not a case of selective scamming, and our postal service here is pretty good.<br /><br />Any comments/thoughts would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Has anyone ever had a successful order to the same name/address after a failed arrival of a prior order?&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers

				Well don&#039;t use fake names next time and your shit won&#039;t get flagged.<br /><br />;3<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend using a new name and drop site.<br /><br />Also, You&#039;re trying to get drugs into a country that scrutinizes mail from other countries a bit more than others.

				for some reason i always feel more comfortable using a fake name than my real name<br />if they didnt try to do bust you it must have been a small amount in which case they probably just threw it in the vault after the dogs sniffed it out<br />they do that with personal amounts over here<br />i wouldnt try to get anything from outside the country thats just asking for trouble <br />its a well known fact Aus has some of the strictest customs in the world<br />i live in the US ive only ordered 2 packages from outside the country the first one never arrived <br />and the second one arrived with 4 DEA agents lol luckily i didnt sign for it safe to say i learned my lesson<br />but domestic shipping should be fine i suppose<br />i know theres a huge difference in price but i believe that falls under the better safe than sorry category <br />gl mate

				cheers for the reply. <br /><br />Yeh i always use my own name, I understand how important that is.<br /><br />I guess if I&#039;ve &quot;burned&quot; my address/name now, ill just have to find a friend who&#039;s happy to allow me to post to his house from now on.

				I can&#039;t say for sure, but I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a safe bet that once a package gets seized--for whatever reason--it gets you flagged in the system.&nbsp; Of course, that&#039;s if the people working there are doing their jobs by the book.&nbsp; Which, based on what I&#039;ve heard about Australia, is the norm for postal workers, especially those working customs.<br /><br />It&#039;s just inherently difficult getting things through customs rather than through a more local mail system.&nbsp; There&#039;s less attention paid to the packages that travel domestically, so more of them slip under the radar.&nbsp; In the US it&#039;s uncommon for a package to get seized--it&#039;s more likely a package doesn&#039;t arrive because of a suspicious/erroneous address.<br /><br />So, yes, you should probably get a friend you can send packages to rather than use a fake name.&nbsp; Fake names just don&#039;t work very well and bring unneeded attention to the mail.&nbsp; Remember, you can (usually) reasonably deny that you requested anything that comes to you in the mail, so even if you continue getting packages sent to you, never sign for any of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, it&#039;s probably not worth the hassle of having to explain your case to LE.&nbsp;

What were you ordering (and how much) that had DEA agents knocking at your door? How did you get away with it? Yeah I don&#039;t care how good a deal it is, I plan to never order internationally. Just not worth the risk. I&#039;m nervous enough dealing domestically. Thanks for any info, it could possibly save one of us the trouble.<br />
