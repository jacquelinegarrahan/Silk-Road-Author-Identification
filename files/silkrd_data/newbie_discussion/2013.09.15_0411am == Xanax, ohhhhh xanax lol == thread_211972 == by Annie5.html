				So i can take up to 50 mg of this shit a day,&nbsp; and dont worry it is legit , its from MedMen and he has all usa pharm grade shit.<br /><br />so anyway, my tolerance is so high that i cant realy get that euphoria like i used to off 2-4 mg<br />fucking anax tolerance sucks.<br /><br />So, my real question is, is there another benzo that doesnt have such a high tolerance like xanax,,, <br />like pocibly kpins for example.<br /><br />I only want experenced benzo users to post in this thread please, and thank you<br />hope to hear for you!

				Hard question. Alprazolam is among the strongest. Clonazepam works great for soe, but other Xanax users think of them a garbage (although I prefer them).<br />I guess your best bet is Flunitrzepam./rohypnol. <br />Phenazepam is supposed to be very active as well, haven&#039;t tried that one though. But I have a friend how got memoryloss for about 3 days, might be something for u :P<br /><br />personally if I was u I would buy Clonazepam and eat lower doses of about 4-10mg/ day for a few weeks and climb down the ladder a bit. After that you Xanax may work as u want them to work again!

				50mg a day? really sounds a little far fetched love seeing as ive been taking xanax for 3yrs and that would make me/anyone loose multiple days.<br /><br />If it is true i wouldnt be worried about which one to take to get high Id be worried about which rehab/hospital to go too before the withdraw symptoms kill you

				The best way is to just take one for the team and go on a month long tolerance break. Switch to weed or any other drug for like 2-4 weeks and workout and your tolerance will be wayy lower. Trust me I&#039;ve done this with weed and lorazapam.

				50mg? How much is all of that costing you a day....? ;D<br />I would recommend taking a break from them for a while, having a tolerence like that isn&#039;t great and is making things alot harder for you if you need some xanax (Health wise and cost wise).<br />Good luck!<br />~D

				Like almost any other Benzos. i.e. Clonazepam, Diazepam, Midazolam, Phenazepam, Oxazepam etc.<br />Xanax (Alprazolam) is among those that work quickest and in small amounts. <br />2mg xanax equal 20mg diazepam if I remember right? However they are all different.<br />I would say Xanax is like vodka (clearm but crazy) , Diazepam is like beer (fuzzy and tired). Clonazepam is like red wine (Fuzzy, warm and tipsy)<br />but that&#039;s my 5 cents. <br /><br />I had 100mg of alpra powder, very small amount.. Disolved it in Propylene glycol and used a syringe without needle to spread 1 ml each on paper and let them dry.<br />So now I have a bunch of xanax blotters. <br />

I would be careful with the diazepam dosage (as well as the tram dosage), I usually take 1 x 10mg, and then one more, and one more, until the tramadol effect subsided and left is only the benzo fog. Then it&#039;s high time to sleep.
