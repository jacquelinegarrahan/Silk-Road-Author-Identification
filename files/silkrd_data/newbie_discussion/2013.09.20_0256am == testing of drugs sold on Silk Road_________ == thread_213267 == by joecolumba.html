				I think that Silk Road themselves should be offering a professional testing service for products sold here,especially cocaine which I would reckon is the most popular item sold.Something like the top 5-10 vendors for each region,eg UK,EUROPE and USA.I think that they should order samples,test them and<br />print the results for all to see,with their connections this could be done quite easily im sure!<br />If you buy product through this site and its has not been tested its no different than buying of the street and the whole SAFETY aspect is out the window!<br />Surely these guys are making enough money to provide this service.<br />Any thoughts on this subject?

				While this sounds like a good idea in theory, it certainly isn&#039;t fool proof. Any vendor can send in legit stuff to test, then send you bunk when you order. <br /><br />SR and those running the show have enough on their plate as is. <br /><br />Besides, there are already the useful threads like the LSD Avengers that test and measure already. Third party testing is best anyways, to prevent SR from playing favorites however unlikely. <br /><br />Just my two satoshi!

				The best way to be safe is to buy your own test kits and test everything you order. That is the only way to know for sure.what you got.

				A nice idea but pointless in practice as anybody could submit a sample of the purist shit for testing, then cut it to fuck for sales

				Hence why some are brought anonymously. I wouldn&#039;t put much stock on the samples given to be tested, only the ones bought as a normal customer.
