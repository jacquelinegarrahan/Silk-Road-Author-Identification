				Okay, here goes...<br /><br />I was taking a lot of good molly from around 2004 to 2007, then decided to call it quits for a few years. When I was taking clean MDMA back then, I don&#039;t remember anything about fizz when I&#039;d test pretty good stuff. I certainly saw a lot of purple, dark purple, and almost black, but I have no recollection of anything fizzing.<br /><br />A year or so ago, I was sold &quot;molly&quot; by some good friends into that whole scene. I had no test kit, but the kids I got it from I had known for years, and with them being sucked into the whole dubstep/EDM/whatever scene, I trusted their judgement. They said it was the best molly they ever had. Well, I took some, then some more, then more and more. I thought it was really cut or something. I felt like I was about to start rolling for hours, but never got that empathetic sigh that I&#039;d always get with MDMA, you know, &quot;ahhh, everything is PERFECT.&quot; Anyway, after the &quot;roll&quot; had worn off, there was a 7 hour speed from hell experience in which I&#039;m pretty sure I had a heart attack. Definitely not MDMA. I called my friends and they laughed at me for saying it was a different substance. I ordered a test. While waiting for the test, I did a lot of research and called my friends saying I thought it was bkMDMA. I was pretty far removed from the whole scene and had never even heard of the shit until I started researching. Skip forward a few days to when my test arrived. I tested it - tons of fizz and then went to a yellow orange. bkMDMA. I showed my friends and they were in disbelief. Turns out that most of my city has never even had real MDMA - everyone is doing fucking methylone. They gave me my money back, and took the bullshit substance back as I urged them to go to their &quot;dude.&quot; I felt he was going to end up killing someone (Someone like me who knew what real MDMA feels like, but had never heard of bkMDMA. The stuff seriously made me feel like I was about to roll, but like I just didn&#039;t quite have enough to get there... so I kept re-dosing [Yes it was dumb - I put too much trust in these friends while also being too fucked up to think about the potential of a newer drug on the scene causing a similar high]. I literally took an extremely lethal amount according to my research - like what Erowid considers a high dose, but five times that amount. Luckily it was spaced over about 6 hours or so). Anyway, let&#039;s get to my question(s)...<br /><br />******&nbsp; As I don&#039;t remember MDMA ever fizzing in the mid 2000&#039;s, I find it strange that fizzing is continually mentioned in lots of reviews of vendors&#039; MDMA. Can someone WHO WAS TAKING MDMA IN/AROUND 2005 tell me if they remember fizzing before turning to shades of purple? It makes sense to me that it WOULD, I just don&#039;t remember seeing it.<br /><br />I have researched and found a little info about reagent tests fizzing in general, I read that fizzing should be ignored and simply means any chemical tested is an HCI - unless it fizzes and takes a while to change colors, or if there&#039;s fizz and no color reaction at all - in which case it&#039;s a piperazine. This makes complete sense as the test is a simple chemical reaction, right? Hopefully you can understand (or empathize with) my suspicion. It just seems highly possible that there may be vendors out there passing off MDMA cut with a piperazine or some shit. If MDMA is cut with a substance that doesn&#039;t change colors but DOES fizz/&quot;smoke&quot; like crazy, wouldn&#039;t it fizz/&quot;smoke&quot; while turning quickly to a purple, keeping you from realizing there is a piperazine present? Also, I can&#039;t help but think about the facts that the color range of yellow to orange are compliments of purple, this means that when mixed, they will create black (at least with paints, dyes, etc.). I would assume that the test results would mix in the same way. If MDMA was cut with methylone, I would think that the test would go straight to black, or from purple to black. This especially wigs me out as some of the best MDMA I&#039;ve ever had went straight to black... I know that stuff was legit, but how can I be sure now that all these RC&#039;s are everywhere? <br />******&nbsp; Does anyone currently have a reagent test and some MDMA as well as methylone or another substance with a yellow to orange reagent result and a test? I&#039;m extremely curious as to what the test would do with, say, two parts MDMA to one part methylone. I think this information could certainly benefit the community.<br /><br />Also, when I was eating molly back then, I never had one of these overwhelming experiences that some people seem to talk about now. Well, ONE time I felt a little paranoid because I my eyes wouldn&#039;t stop bouncing around and I was sweating buckets, puked, dehydration, etc. Granted, I had eaten a half gram followed by another half gram 45 minutes later at a music festival, I was watching the Flaming Lips and was completely squished - no room to move. No water either. I left the crowd and sat with some friends and re-hydrated... my eyes were bouncing so fast that I couldn&#039;t see the stage. I&#039;ve eaten a full gram on maybe three occasions, but the only time I was overwhelmed was at that show. The shit might have been cut with something harmless, but .2 could get me off to the point of hugging strangers, so I know it wasn&#039;t BS. The first time I rolled, I was taking white sunflowers clocked at 375mg MDA according to dancesafe and ecstasydata. I took like 3 in one night and never felt overwhelmed, even it being my first time. The fact that anyone could NOT enjoy a small dose of MDMA kind of bugs me out, anyone know what&#039;s up? I&#039;ve never met anyone who didn&#039;t enjoy MDMA. <br />******&nbsp; Have I simply been ignorant to the fact that this is just certain people&#039;s personalities and people have always bugged out when rolling? Or is it possible that maybe these people aren&#039;t taking MDMA?<br /><br />Finally, I have two more paranoid questions:<br /><br />******&nbsp; The fact that MDMA and methylone rocks can look pretty similar is scary. I think it&#039;s totally possible for someone to grind the two substances up and mix, put on low heat with a small amount of safrole, then evap the safrole and recrystallize into larger rocks again. I would think safrole or sassafras oil would cause the test to go purple. I searched and only found one document, but it said that it certainly does show up purple, at least on Marquis. [Source: http://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/SCITEC21_07fin.pdf&nbsp; Note: The link is a pdf so open it accordingly] What do you think?<br /><br />******&nbsp; The fact that safrole or sassafras oil can fool a reagent is scary too. I thought about some of the MDMA reviews I read saying that their molly was extremely oily. I&#039;ve had pretty oily shit before, it was a result of extreme heat. However, it makes me raise an eyebrow to anyone with oily MDMA - it&#039;s really easy to re-crystalize after it&#039;s been melted, so why would anyone in their right mind sell a product like that? *Eyebrow raises* Unless they were up to something fishy? With the lack of real molly on the streets (in my city at least), I think it&#039;s a total possibility for someone to use safrole or sassafras oil to coat something like a piperazine, then sell it as molly without anyone saying a word... simply because they&#039;ve never had real MDMA and it probably fools their reagent (well, we know it fools Marquis). What do you think?<br /><br />I opened this thread with one question in mind, but as I typed, more questions arose and I started doing searches, which in turn caused even MORE questions. I didn&#039;t mean to write a novel here, I apologize. Thanks for sticking with me all the way through!&nbsp; :)<br />

				Hi - I was in much the same situation as you. I had lots of contacts from which to obtain mdma between 1989 - 2007, then I lost my contacts . A few years later some new contacts (much younger) were raving about their pills and mdma - I assumed they knew what they were doing since they were big clubbers and bought a large amnt from them - as soon as I saw it, I was like &quot;wtf is this?&quot;. Trying to get them to understand that they were not taking mdma but piperazines was fucking useless.<br />Anyway - like you at tha point I started reading up and saw that the whole mdma scene had gone down the rabit hole and these kids were raving on worm tablets. Since then I have been offered all kinds of mdma - purple stuff that is almost crystally but doesn&#039;t quite crush right; stuff that looks like soft brown sugar; More brown sticky clumps - every person who was selling it to me had genuinely been taking this stuff. I did test some batches at that point, it did nothing but fizz a bit - fuck knows what that was, but before it went all messed up I never tested anything so can&#039;t say whether it fizzed before going black.<br /><br />My paranoia has passed now that I&#039;ve found jesusofrave on here though. He keeps it real!

				I&#039;ve been using MDMA since late 80s. Prior to the test kits being available, quality was always a total crap shoot, unless you happened to know the cook personally or made it yourself. If you look at the ecstasydata stats, http://www.ecstasydata.org/stats.php, you can see that in almost every year since they started testing, over half their results show adulterated or bogus pills, with 2004-2009 being particularly bad. I&#039;m not sure if quality today is really any worse than it&#039;s been in the past, if anything, the stats imply its getting better, but it&#039;s hard to say how representative ecstasydata is of the overall market (I&#039;m guessing people tend to send in more dodgy pills than the ones they like).<br /><br />Regarding the test results, there are several different reagents. The following FAQ describes typical results for each: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml. BTW, dancesafe recommends Mecke as the best one to use for MDMA, if you can only pick one.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the FAQ says, a darker result can mask a lighter one, so it&#039;s definitely possible to have a mixture of MDMA and something else show a positive result, as you surmised.&nbsp; The home test kits do not guarantee quality, unfortunately. You need a real lab for that.<br /><br />My own experience is that most MDMA I&#039;ve tested does not fiz or smoke, but I usually use Mecke.&nbsp; I have occasionally seen the Marquis bubble a bit if I use a larger sample size. <br /><br />Really pure MDMA should be white, dry, crystalline solid. Other colors and consistency result from some impurities, although it&#039;s totally possible to have a batch of brown &quot;MDMA &quot; be cleaner than a batch of white &quot;MDMA&quot;.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the quality of MDMA on SR seems quite good relative to what you are going to find on the street, so if you pick a reputable vendor here, you should be quite happy with what you get.
