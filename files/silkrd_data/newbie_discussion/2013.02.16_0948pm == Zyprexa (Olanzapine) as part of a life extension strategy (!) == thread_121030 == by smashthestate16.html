				I&#039;m currently enjoying some 4-FA, and that means I&#039;m overflowing with things to talk about. I&#039;m copying/pasting this post I just made on a forum on the clearnet, you&#039;ll notice the format is a little odd, due to the forum rules. Anyways, tell me what you think!<br />______________________________________________<br />I know most people are going to read this thread title and be all whaaa? But hear me out on this interesting theory my dog came up with, and tell me if you think he&#039;s nuts or not. Again, this is simply a theory and neither me nor my dog is suggesting anyone actually try this.<br /><br />Background info:<br />In a nutshell: The aging process is primarily caused by gradual loss of DNA instructions in the process of cell division. In theory, slowing cell reproduction would result in a more gradual loss of DNA over a given period of time. Cell reproduction rate is a function of cell metabolic rate. There are 3 main factors that influence metabolic rate:<br />1. Nutrient availability<br />2. Presence of waste products<br />3. Temperature<br /><br />1 and 2 go together. Less available nutrition for cells to process results in a decrease in waste byproducts. 70 years ago studies were done on rats and mice concluding that a calorie restricted diet increased lifespan by as much as double, and on average 30-40%. Studies done on primates have not been conclusive but then again they may not have been well designed and there haven&#039;t been that many done. So that&#039;s a little interesting, right?<br /><br />Here&#039;s where it gets even more interesting, when you bring temperature into the equation. Core body temperature is typically 37° C. It is known that a 1° C reduction in core body temperature results in a 5-7% reduction in cell metabolism. Now there&#039;s this concept of therapeutic hypothermia. Read up on it if you like, it will give you a better idea of its potential health benefits in certain situations such as preserving brain cells in the wake of a stroke. Major organs start to fail typically around 30° C. That gives a good amount of leeway for this hypothetical life extension experiment. 32.2° C is the low end of the mild hypothermia diagnosis, that seems to be a reasonable target temperature. That gives a temp reduction of 4.8° C, resulting in anywhere between ~24-33% drop in cell metabolic rate. Presumably that also means an equivalent reduction in the rate of cell division.<br /><br />But how can a hypothermic body temperature possibly be conveniently maintained on a long-term basis? That&#039;s where Zyprexa comes in. A well known side effect of Zyprexa is &quot;body temperature dysregulation.&quot; Which happens to mean a reduction in core body temperature, sometimes apparently below 35° C, the threshold for a hypothermic state. In fact, many of the negative side effects of Zyprexa and other atypical antipsychotics have been attributed to this reduction in body temp. As far as my dog can tell, Zyprexa causes the most dramatic reductions among this class of drugs. Some of these side effects include hyperglycemia, weight gain, sedation, type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. What&#039;s happening here is your body is preferentially burning fat for energy over carbohydrates, meaning when you eat carbs your blood sugar stays elevated instead of burned off for energy. However, the first prong of this life extension strategy is eat a calorie restricted diet, preferably low glycemic for the greatest minimizing action on these side effects.<br /><br />As you can see, there&#039;s still room for further body temperature reduction here. This might be accomplished by simply wearing less clothes in a cold environment, or an icepack attached with velcro to the inner thigh, where the leg meets the groin. Sure, it doesn&#039;t sound very comfortable or practical but its certainly doable and one could probably get used to it.<br /><br />Additional observations: To quell hunger a low dose stimulant could be helpful, or perhaps the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Strattera (atomoxetine). To cure shivering, magnesium sulfate could be useful, or just a bit of Demerol (meperidine). There&#039;s a few others too that could work.<br /><br />Any thoughts? My dog is really just throwing this out there. At least, it could make for interesting reading while SWIYou is enjoying a nice adderall buzz or something of the sort, haha.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=206562#ixzz2L6HzeeJo
