				I don&#039;t know if this is rolled out to everybody, but I now see a new bitinstant.com page. <br /><br />A few of the voucher options are gone, but it reinstates cash deposits. Also BTC--&gt;ACH or BTC--&gt;direct debit transfer are now available. This can save quite a bit on fees through other methods. If you&#039;re not queasy about buying BTC through ACH, coinbase has this capability with lower fees.<br /><br />Any concerns using BTC--&gt;ACH so long as the BTC are cleaned before they&#039;re exchanged?

				None at all.&nbsp; It would be a painstaking process to track BTC especially after being tumbled at SR.&nbsp; No offence, but you are probably a big enough criminal to be worth putting in the effort to even try.

				None taken. But the reality is people get busted for small amounts all the time. They just probably/hopefully wouldn&#039;t go through the trouble of tracking BTC to get a small-time user dealing in single bitcoins. CD is probably where somebody like me would get caught, but as DPR says, it&#039;s a gamble with our freedom to have a relaxed attitude.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

				New website has been sketchy......was going to make a deposit via moneygram, I went to the store and clerk said &#039;account number is no good&#039;. Went back to try a different one and this time kept getting a message saying they were having trouble with their vendor and try again later, kept pushing the button and it finally went thru, sounds like others are having huge issues with it. Will take a look at Bitcoin-Brokers

				Used successfully today. Had to register an account with mostly real info. In process of tumbling coin and a half now.<br /><br />But yeah, no problems with the transaction, although I always seem to get the worse possible exchange rate available at any time the day I transact, but whatever.

				Hello all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Couple questions. <br />1. Is it unwise to send moneys directly to my SR account via zipzap/bitinstant if using cash. <br />2. is there still a delay in processing times? <br />3. should i send money to my blockchain account then to my SR wallet?<br /><br />Thanks in advance and please dont feel the need to jump down my throat if these are stupid questions. . . Thank you all in advance.! <br /><br />Jamin

				What really strikes me as odd is the fact that BitInstant put out a statement yesterday telling everyone they were working on the transactions and that everyone&#039;s money is safe. Why is this weird you ask? Because they posted the msg on their fucking Facebook page, not their regular site. Something smells fishy?

				I used bitinstant on 6/12. I still haven&#039;t received my bit coins.<br /><br />The last I heard from them they emailed me asking for my ZipZap acct. #, which i provided and haven&#039;t heard anything in 24 hours. This is terrible as I am out $280 at this point.<br /><br />I will say I have never had an issue with any deposits w/ Bitinstant before and this is the first time this has happened to me. I am starting to think that I am fucked tho....
