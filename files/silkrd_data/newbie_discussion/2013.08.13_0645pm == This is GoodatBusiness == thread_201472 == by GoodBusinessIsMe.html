				This is goodatbusiness, my vendor priveleges were taken due to a misunderstanding but all is well and I probably deserved it for acting crazy; however, I am not a scammer and I would like to set he record straight on that. I upheld orders with more than generous product and stealth unmatched by any vendor I&#039;ve ever used once. If someone deserved a refynd I&#039;d send it to them directly from my account and usually with 20-50% extra for their trouble and simply entrust them to finalize order; this way they could not get a refund on buyer score and so they could review honestly. I started this account on SR to serve the people good product at low prices in a safe manner that would ensure plausivle deniabiloty in the 0.001% chance of discovery and effectively pass even the most rigorous postal inspection if package became opened in transit (which some did; then safely delivered I might add). I shipped over 500 ordrs and maintained a (97)in the process because I admittedly was off some of the time but on point or above average 97% of the time<br /><br />I&#039;ve had packages opened by sorting machines and destroyed by rain back when&nbsp; I was using flimsy paper packaging to seem more dromeday and average but they would still get delivered with goods onside and absoliutely no suspicion. Obviously I changed packages promptly but it just goes to show that the sr community deserves better standards to be set when it comes to sendng illegal contraband; admitedly, we cant all be anti-social obsessive compulsive crazy&#039;s like myself but we could at least try harder... I can&#039;t order from SR anymore because I hold a prestigious title in my community as shocking as that may be and I just can&#039;t risk it.... I wanted to create a go-to solution for being the guy that you knew would never land you in jail from poor packaging. We all know a sloppy vendor can fuckup your life quicker than almost anyone else can but yet you entust us wth your freedom and I wanted to show you the respect you deserve as a result. <br /><br />I just need everyone to know that I never scammed anyone and I never meant to threaten if it came off that way because I fucking love you guys, I have always been accused of being awkward and different my whole life so I relied on keeping my mouth shut for the most part of my vending but this project was my baby and I needed to make sure it is remembered as the service it was; and not be demeaned by the crazy jabber I posted at the end of it&#039;s being, my thoughts are out there but they should remain thoughts I know at this point. Goodatbusiness is not me as a person it is a motto for all vendors to follow; know your role and understand the responsibility you take when sending potential jail sentances to people hom you&#039;ve never met. On a side not to my customers, I&#039;m sorry I never answerded your emails but it was because I am anti-social and come off as crazy when I talk but I am positive in my capability of running my business so I just stayed silent. I&#039;ll also note that it&#039;s surprisingly hard to find a secretary to answer your drug related emails just so people never hear your deluded thoughts and get scared off.<br /><br />I just wanted to set the record straight an all current orders re going out at which point I will be dust in the wind. Thanks for all the god tmes and know that this is exactly what I wanted, I was ready to go I just needed my true intentions to be understood; I am a spook and crazy alot of the time so maybe not cut out to be a vendor but i will say that did my damndest to provide a service I would&#039;ve been confident enough to order through agan and again.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I love you guys,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GoodatBusiness

				Hey so this is username on here is the same one i use with SR. There was a very disturbing thread about you recently, and had me incredibly worried. I&#039;m sending you a pm about the situation we&#039;re in right now because I&#039;d like to get it sorted out as soon as possible considering when you asked for my address a couple days ago the message still hasn&#039;t been read and it&#039;s been weeks since my initial order. I&#039;m not angry, you&#039;re probably having to deal with a bunch of shit right now but please get back to me via pm or on here. <br /><br />Also I&#039;d like to say that although this vendor makes mistakes, or takes a long time to process stuff he has never done wrong by me. Almost every order get&#039;s 50% extra or even doubled with him. He might not read to messages but he reads the titles and always get&#039;s it done eventually. Be prepared to wait, don&#039;t order if you&#039;re not wiling to wait. It just varies, I&#039;ve had an order marked int transit same day and arrive 3 days later, and I&#039;ve had an order sitting in processing for 6 days. But if there is ever a wait, or a mix up, he&#039;s made it up to me more than any other vendor ever has done. <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to add that while I was trying to extend the date from the original 5 day extension to 1 more days I accidentally released funds.&nbsp; I would appreciate it if you could let me know whether my orders was one of the ones that shipped out Monday. I&#039;ve messaged you via PM so you shouldn&#039;t have any trouble replying here or there. I do sincerely hope that you regain your vendor status though. You offered some of the best product as well as the best prices on most of your listings.
