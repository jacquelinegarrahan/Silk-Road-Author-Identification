				I&#039;m a very early member, and in the past I&#039;ve helped out the site by vending(just small amounts in the very very early days) and spotting and reporting security bugs to DPR (before he was called DPR). <br /><br />I don&#039;t spam on the forum because I only post when I feel I have something to say. Apparently that means I can&#039;t post anymore. So now I need to un-newbie myself, so that in future when I do have something important to say, I will be able to.

				Not many options here, 50 posts is a pretty decent number if you ask me.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t too hard to attain, and you have to want to. So when an account gets &quot;banned&quot; they have to start for 50 posts all over, helps cull the waste.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind, I won&#039;t hit 50 very soon and I am even ok with that.<br /><br />Lets work on keeping the main forums clean and getting some way to rid them of spammy trash that has been happening the past few months (the btc spam among others, idiots with names like dprs mom).

				I guess it&#039;s good for noobs cuz it means the forum isn&#039;t just a big noob circle jerk with no experienced users in here.&nbsp; But it seems that it&#039;s still just a big noob clusterfuck.&nbsp; There seems to be good conversations in obscure places but they pop up in the middle of these trying-to-get-50 spam orgies.&nbsp; It&#039;d be cool if all the pointless stuff could stick to a couple threads, then this section might be a little more productive.&nbsp; Aren&#039;t we supposed to be learning how to choose the right threads to post in and learning to use the search tool for finding spam threads to spam?&nbsp; Seems like 80% of the posts in here are for spamming to 50.&nbsp; I guess if I was a pseudonoob I&#039;d be trying to just pump out as many quick posts as possible to get the fuck out of here and back to business...

				It does really suck that you pretty much need to spam to be able to post in the real forums,<br />though I think I completely agree with this, you have to really want to participate in the forums to participate in the forums.<br /><br />I just hope that non-newbies go over the newbie thread occasionally, it seems a little dumb to have newbie questions answered by other newbies.

				Yea. This is slightly frustrating. I&#039;ve been a long time customer, but just started vending. The vendor profile doesn&#039;t have many posts yet and I&#039;m stuck in the n00b zone. I was able to get some info out before the shift. As frustrating as the whole n00b corral may be to some of us, it will force new members to become more active in the community. It could be Silk Road orientation class. <br /><br />Repeat after me if thou shall so choose:<br /><br />I hereby make a vow to periodically keep checking back in on the n00b section to help new members with their questions even when I am a JR member and beyond!<br /><br />Also, obligatory spam...<br /><br />&nbsp;decent street blow: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/501ad082ff<br /><br />Introductory Prices.
