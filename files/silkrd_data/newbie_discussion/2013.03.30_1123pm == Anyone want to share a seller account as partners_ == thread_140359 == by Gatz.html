				Here is my dilemma, I have only half of the amount necessary to start a seller account. Is there anyone out there in the same shoes as me who doesn&#039;t have all of the money needed but part of it and wants to be a SR vendor? <br /><br />Most of my money right now is invested (I have to invest to keep from spending, it&#039;s a self-control thing)<br /><br />Or is there someone willing to make an investment in me? I am reputed off of silkroad and I&#039;m just looking to expand my enterprise, I am an exchanger.

As an exchanger I make anywhere from 2-10% on every transaction. So, me not having the capital of $500 to invest into a SR account is not unheard of.

I&#039;m sorry to break this reality to you but a lot of the players on the outside world want nothing to do with this black market, if anything they want disassociation because they believe you guys give Bitcoin a bad rep. I&#039;m not up my own ass, and I don&#039;t think bitcoin is some holy grail currency and that&#039;s why I&#039;m here. So to address your inquiry, it&#039;s not so much that their isn&#039;t anyone that trusts me outside of the anonymity it&#039;s that, the people who do don&#039;t want their money going anywhere near SR and because I keep transparency with my investors, I&#039;m not going to lie about where their money is going.

				If you are already operating legally and legitimately, why in the world would you want to advertise that fact here?&nbsp; Bitcoin is legal, but my understanding is that selling anything here is dangerous, legally-speaking because you are participating in a criminal enterprise.&nbsp; But, everyone has differing opinions on that subject, just thought it was a weird thing to advertise openly, especially when you operate on the clearnet.<br /><br />Also, if you are taking 2-10% from each transaction, how in the world do you not have enough to pay for your own vendor account here?&nbsp; 2-10% isn&#039;t a huge profit, but it&#039;s enough to be able to afford an account here if you&#039;ve been as well-respected and well-known as you claim.

				You&#039;re not ready to be a vendor. Why? 2 reasons I can immediately come up with:<br /><br />1. You asked this question (the main reason)<br />2. You don&#039;t have enough money for a vendor account (and yet you expect to be a successful drug distributor with 250 bucks in your pocket?)<br /><br />So you present yourself here as lacking finances AND intelligence (or, at least, enough intelligence to do the proper research before getting vendor status). You realize, even if someone were to help you, they&#039;d have to be relatively incompetent to accept your offer, don&#039;t you? Take a step back and look at your post. Would YOU help YOU? I doubt it. And I doubt even more you would help you if you were one of us.

				Heya,&nbsp; <br />Heres a story for all the people that say you´re not ready blah blah. Take their advice but I see no sellers saying that. <br /><br />My names ACE, I started off as a buyer and became more and more interested in selling. So I went to morocco, bought some of the best hash I could buy and decided I would stand out from the rest just through customer service and quality of product. That was my dream but alas the vendor fee hiked to 500 bucks... So I was stuck, no contacts to sell to IRL, a big pile of hash and no way to become a vendor....<br /><br />Soooo... I did what you did, posted on the forums and some very special guy called CaptainMal saw potential in me and gave me the coins to start up.<br /><br />3-4 months down the line, I have over 300 transactions, were in the top 10% of sellers, I have an amazing team that work for me (TK, and TrashBox), Every day I´m able to provide SR users with some of the finest drugs in the world. My rating is 98%, mainly not 99 or 100 due to scammers. I&#039;m confident and so is everyone behind us that we´ll make the top 1% before long. <br /><br />So all I got to say to you is, don´t listen to anyone else, If you believe you are ready then you are, go for it, let no one hold you back from your dream. <br /><br />Now as for getting you started, what service do you offer? is it something that can be easily incorporated into another vendors account or would you need your own account? <br /><br />Sell me your idea, what are you here to do. <br /><br />ACE

				The only way this would ever work is if you went into business with someone you knew IRL. It&#039;s never going to be safe to do this online.<br /><br />Though I am tempted to take up your offer. Proxy all my orders through to other vendors (no risk to me) and then the moment there was more than $250 in the account I&#039;d cut and run.<br /><br />:)<br />

That&#039;s why I said this is a futile attempt. People are completely missing the point and talking about drugs and packaging though.

				Even in the real world finding new suppliers for bulk amounts is a meticulous process where one has to acquire trust and you can never be too careful.&nbsp; Now imagine you have an online vendor account, sharing or invested by or with an anonymous person. Who will hold the password and pin of account? So many possible outcomes, so many dangers. You have to be in a desperate state to do something like this.

				I&#039;ve been busy lately so sorry for the hiatus. As for the Mod&#039;s inquiry as to why I can&#039;t split my 2-10%, I have tuition to pay for and family costs to pay for so when it comes to investments like a SR Vendor I can&#039;t make it all at once. I don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll get the investment back or if my venture here will even be successful in time to pay the next bill. As for why I am looking for business here, the profits are far greater than on the clearnet and for the same services as well. <br /><br /><br />What do I plan on selling?<br /><br />I plan on exchanging Bitcoins<br />Selling Noots - Nootropics (maybe)<br />Making Coupons/ Graphics<br /><br /><br />I also have the source code for the bitcoingem.com which I am also looking to sell.

				It is amazing how many people don&#039;t read all the way through and form an opinion without the knowledge available. It worries me because these same people are putting SR at risk, the probably didn&#039;t read the stuff about keeping SR quite. <br />I hope your adventure takes off, I wish I could help.
