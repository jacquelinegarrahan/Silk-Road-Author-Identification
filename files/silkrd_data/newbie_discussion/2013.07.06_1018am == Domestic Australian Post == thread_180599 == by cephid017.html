				I would have posted this in the Shipping section however seeing as I&#039;m not up to 50 posts yet and don&#039;t exactly want to spam to get there...:<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing SR and noticed one seller who made this claim: <br />&quot;There are NO customs in domestic Australian post, this means your items will NEVER be seized.&quot;<br />This strikes me as interesting and I&#039;m forced to wonder how correct this is. Can anyone confirm this?

				Are you sure? Its been all over the news about the crack down of illicit items being mailed through-out australia, and that they are cracking down on it. Is there any reliable source that states or some website that confirms there are no customs with domestic post?<br /><br />

				Your best bet is to ask your lawyer for up to date information, they can get the case work if they don&#039;t know the latest already.<br />&nbsp;Our one gathered that there is no operation set up at randomly check mail however mail scrutiny is now a larger part of medium and high end investigations.

				There was a police operation last year that was dedicated to finding drugs within the AusPost network. If I remember correctly it was just one post office and the amount of drugs they seized was pretty pathetic. Unless your already being watched by LE or your package smells like weed the chances of your order being seized is very low.

				They do move dogs on the occasion past the freight planes. Can&#039;t name which ones but i work in the mail/delivery industry. <br /><br />Does happen on the occasion, mainly after big things though.
