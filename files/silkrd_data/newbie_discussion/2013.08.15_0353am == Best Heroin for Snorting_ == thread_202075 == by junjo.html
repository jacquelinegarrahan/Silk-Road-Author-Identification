				Hello, I&#039;m looking for the best heroin on SR for snorting. e.g. something that&#039;s a very dry, fine powder, and preferably has little to no cut. I&#039;d also rather buy it by the gram rather than by the stamp. Any vendor recommendations? Thanks!

				Subsrgood.&nbsp; If DeluxeDelivery has it by the gram, that would be dry enough.

				Hey Man,<br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t have a problem giving someone a chance, Terabithia Is the Shit!!! They had some personal issues a few weeks ago and went offline for a few weeks, thus the 93 rating. I had ordered a couple of stamps when that happened and had my order go 3 weeks in transit, into resolution for another week, Then got my %100 refund. When he came back, I hit him up and let him know that I had to wait almost a month for my money to come back and he asked for my address to make it up to me. Since I&#039;d had prior transactions, I threw it to him and sent me 4 stamps for free out of nowhere, just for having around 25 bucks wait in limbo for a few weeks. Not a bad deal, AND THE H IS DUMB STRONG. Dry as well. There are many vendors out there tho, this is just my pick.

				The USA domestic makes things difficult. OZexpress has china white at hefty prices but the quality is out of this world.Plus shipping from Australia to the US is way easier than Holland to US.<br />

				When I dabble in H, I snort it as well . I&#039;ve tried a few and found supremesmoke pretty dam good for sniffing , as well as pretty dam potent. I haven&#039;t used him in a while but he&#039;s still got a high rating so it seems he&#039;s still ding it right.

				Any #4 should be good for snorting. Though I don&#039;t have any personal experience with heroin on the road(yet), everybody in the heroin review forums seems to love subsrgood&#039;s shit. That or Supremesmoke, those are the ones everybody seems to be recommending the most. Although some guy said his friend straight overdosed off of a 25mg line of dragoncove&#039;s shit, which that&#039;s usually a good sign lol.
