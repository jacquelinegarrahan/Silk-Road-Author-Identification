				First ...welcome to being a vendor. <br /><br />Second...don&#039;t offer samples. It in no way helps you and will just be a headache for no reason.<br /><br />Third&nbsp; you need to link your forum account to your vendor page...you do that by going to your settings. Where it ask for your signature..put a link to your vendor profile. Otherwise your post will be deleted as no one will know you have a vendor account. This is yet another reason why there is a 50 post count min..even for vendors. As this forum has little to do with Silk Road.<br /><br />Good Luck

				Once you have 35+ transactions and a link to your vendor profile in your forum signature, you can send a message to inigo requesting access to the vendor forums.&nbsp; If granted, you can post anywhere regardless of your post count.<br /><br />In the meantime, why not make use of your time here in the Newbie subforum by advertising your product and letting people leave feedback?

				thanks for all the help guys. i got my vendors link in the sig now. <br /><br />i have several free samples going out for paid shipping already but i wanted to do 2 more.<br />I’m looking for folks who have been here for a few months and have good stats. Looking for members who buy a minimum of 1 oz at a time because that’s the smallest I sell. I will set up a private listing and send it to you.&nbsp; I plan to send the orders out by tue so the cut off will be mon 1pm mst. shipping will be $6 2-3 day priority mail (preferred) or a $3 first class package (crushed?). <br />1+ gram sample.

				Yes it applies to vendors as well. But if I was a vendor I would get my 50 before I set up an account.<br />Because, a vendor has enough to deal with at first.

				Hey Jacob1234.&nbsp; I see you&#039;re up to 42.&nbsp; Wish I was.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be a man soon!&nbsp; I&#039;m in the vendor forum because of my stats, and that means I can post anywhere.&nbsp; But&nbsp; I want to get to fifty to get rid of the newbie tag after my name.&nbsp; I also want to be able to dole out +karma.&nbsp; Not into giving negative karma.&nbsp; Figured I&#039;d knock out my 50 posts in the newbie forum because no one here (or very few) have the karma granting authority to give me minus karma points for the spam and general drivel I&#039;m spreading over this channel today.<br /><br />Does 50 posts get rid of the newbie tag?&nbsp; And does it get you karma power?<br /><br />On the topic of this post, I disagree with the guy who said samples were a waste of time.&nbsp; I sent out about 50 samples of bud when I first started.&nbsp; Definitely got me loyal repeat paying customers immediately who have been with me ever since.&nbsp; Started just a few months ago and already have more business than I can handle.&nbsp; Completely sold out again with another month to wait before my next crop is ready to harvest.&nbsp; I absolutely credit the samples for a lot of my initial success.&nbsp; People who get free samples tend to write great product reviews and spread good word of moutn.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents worth.<br /><br />JackBlue<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/15f394e321

				It feels like I&#039;ve been doing this for a week already and I&#039;m only up to 30 posts.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going to have to find a local stoner or crackhead around my neighborhood and bribe him with drugs to finish the last 20 posts for me.
