				Title: <strong>Mephedrone reviews</strong><br />

				My first three month report on SR is that the Amazon-for-drugs tag is well deserved in terms of most areas. The one glaring problem, no doubt obvious to all, is the one that we all have when buying in the prohibition regime elsewhere, namely that quality can be very varied, even if the dealer is easy/honest to work with as the two in this report have been.<br /><br />As a fairly hard-core mephedrone user from the UK legal days, injecting IM, I can say that nothing I so far have tried of the three lots I have had is up to the quality of the legal market, and some is very bad. I see reports like this as key to the efficient development of SR, and I intend to keep this thread updated with the various excitements I trip over in the meph market here.<br /><br />My opinion is only that, but it&#039;s based on experience using the material without other substances in IM in doses varying from 75 to 220 mg.<br /><br />LIMETLESS. <br /><br />The cheaper stuff from Lim does not give the euphoric lift of the real deal, but is very speedy. Fine if you want to rush around, and not too bad on hangover. 4/10<br />The better stuff lim offers is much more fun and I got a real whiff of the old days, but again a bit on the speedy side. 7/10<br /><br />SONICDRONE<br />This material is the worst I have tried and has a come-down worse than MDMA. I don&#039;t know what it is but its relation to mephedrone is tenuous. Speedy. 2/10<br /><br />It does occur to me that if SR offered a testing service for dealers to send samples and they linked the report to their marketing it might be welcome to everyone; scammers would not be so delighted of course, but it would be a further boost for the integrity of the SR project.<br /><br />

				SYMBIOSIS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now this guys meph is the best I have had since the ban. Fair lift and none of the excessive speediness that has been the poor aspect of other offerings I have had. I shall definitely be buying this again. 8/10

				Hi there,<br /><br />Just to five my input also, I made a few purchages of mephedrone lately <br /><br />SONICDRONE -&gt; garbage I think this is 4-mec or some inferior shit<br /><br />LIMETLESS-&gt; Well till now probably the best meph on SILK(I&#039;m talking about his crystal meph), it&#039;s not near what pre ban was.. but you will get euphoria, and good feeling of meph, but it seems to be different from the pre ban meph.. it will not last as long.. and after some hours you will not get euphoria anymore, but still best meph you can find here at least in my opinion<br /><br />Wertu-&gt; First order was top notch..&nbsp; meph was fantastic.. a 200mg line was comparable to a 100mg pre ban line.. but the euphoria and high was there.. my next order product was pure shit.. I could not even consider it to be mephedrone probably was some unknown RC.. not sure not gonna buy anything more from this guy.<br /><br />Full Escrow UK-&gt;&nbsp; this vendor was disrespectful to me after my bad review on his meph.. what can I say.. his meph was mediocre at least to me I could not feel nothing good from it.. it didn&#039;t even smell like mephedrone.. which I found odd since ppl in the reviews were saying that it had a strong smell.. so not sure not gonna buy from this mofo again.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				I find these reviews a but weird. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried Lims, Goldust and Wertu. Got some from FEUK but yet to try. <br /><br />Lims and Goldust is the best and compared to pre-ban of a few years ago there is no real difference that I can tell. I bought it all the time and sold the shit so I know what I&#039;m talking about. <br /><br />There are lot of rose tinted glasses from people banging on about pre-ban days. Lims stuff was sent to a lab in Europe and independently tested and confirmed as pure mephedrone. What more do you guys want?<br /><br />Now symbiosis, their MDMA is fucking awesome but I&#039;ve read some very average reviews of their mephedrone. Yet you say it&#039;s amazing. I&#039;m very sceptical. But it&#039;s cheap so I&#039;ll order to see what it&#039;s like. <br /><br />FEUK on the other hand has amazing reviews and the experience I&#039;ve had communicating with them has been perfect and the shipping was ultra quick and used MBB bags which shows they care about getting the package through safely as possible. <br /><br />That is all newbs. <br />

				I recently ordered 1g of meph from Symbiosis and can honestly say it was as close to pre-ban as I have ever experienced, both in appearance and effects. It gave me the same euphoric rush that I used to experience with very little speediness and no insomnia (sleep within 2 hours of last line without assistance),&nbsp; of course it was also just as fiendy as the pre-ban and hard to put the packet down once opened, but that&#039;s meph for you. Delivery was also within 24 hours of placing the order.
