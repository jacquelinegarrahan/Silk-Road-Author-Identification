				I&#039;ve got an idea for FEing if a vendor requires it (and you haven&#039;t learned your lesson by reading the hundreds of post by others telling you not to FE): just leave a 1 out of 5 UNTIL you get your shit, then edit it to reflect your experience. If vendors want to FE for small purchases/newbies then they should be put at the bottom of the rank and their stats should lower short term. What do you think?

				While finalizing early in that fashion may encourage a seller who is genuine, but who has FEs for some reason,&nbsp; to fix things it (and it is questionable how many of these there are if any) it will also piss sellers of that character off and encourage negative interactions. Whereas negative ratings will mean absolutely nothing to an FE scammer and therefore will do you little good.

				If you leave a 1/5 because you chose to FE then you are extremely ignorant and the vendor will blacklist you immediately.

				Yea I wouldn&#039;t do that to a vendor. Not the way to start a relationship.<br /><br />&nbsp;Jeez.<br /><br />Find a vendor who will stay in escrow for anyone that is new, or if you feel you must FE, only FE on a small amount..basically an amount you can afford to lose.<br /><br />There are threads on top of threads around here about how even top vendors screw noobs over who FE...so really I would buy from someone who doesn&#039;t require it.

				If you&#039;re going to FE just don&#039;t leave a review until you receive...Or decide it&#039;s not coming. Simple. Leave a 1/5 and you&#039;ll almost definitely not receive anything.
