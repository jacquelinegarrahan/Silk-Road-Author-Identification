				I made a deposit via, bitcoinnordic.com and in the address field I put in my SR bitcoin adresss. Its been 2 days and it has still not showed up. Then I went on reading that you have to make a separate bitcoin address (like Multibit or electrum) and transfer from there to you SR account. I&#039;m so confused is my money now gone?

				I&#039;m having the same issue.<br /><br />I sent directly from a bitcoin account to SR&#039;s bc account. It&#039;s been confirmed, and the account I sent to has split and sent it automatically to other accounts showing the SR has received it.<br /><br />But it&#039;s not showing up in my SR balance :(<br /><br />My first time here, and seeing lots of other people have the same problem is making me feel very uncomfortable about my money...

				I really hope my money isnt gone to nowhere! Waiting for a reply from bitcoinnordic. I didnt know you had to make a separate bitcoin acount first. Then first get some money sendt to that wallet &amp; from there to SR. So complicated. But really

				Silk Road is currently experiencing minor deposit delays.&nbsp; Please contact SR support&nbsp; in 12 hours if the deposit still has not arrived and they will take care of it.

				Try not using your sr wallet directly. Download bitcoin client and let it sync with the network.<br />After your wallet is synched and encrypted you should do all your transactions from there. <br /><br />Get your bitcoins there on your personal wallet and from there transfer them wherever you like. <br />This will allow you to have full control of your coins and you know exactly where the delays are and how many <br />confirmations left for the transaction. <br /><br />Try not to send all your coins at once. Send 0.1 see if everything is OK and then send the rest.

				There was a major issue sending BTC yesterday, don&#039;t know if it was general or just specific to SR. It took well over 12 hours for me to get my deposit (usually takes 30 to 90 min) but it did arrive, I don&#039;t know whether the problem is still ongoing. It don&#039;t think it wouldn&#039;t have made any difference whether you&#039;d sent directly to SR account or via a wallet. I&#039;d be interested to see whether the problem has been fixed.
