				Ok so i try to log on to Silkroad and every time i do, it just refreshes back to the login screen with all the fields (username, password, verification) blank. it doesn&#039;t say that the login failed, all the things i typed in just disappear like i never typed it in the first place. at first i though it was a glitch but its been doing it for quite sometime now. I tried reinstalling tor browser and that didnt work. It cant be my account though because i can get on it using my phone. I just need to be able to get on it on my computer because my phone cant do pgp :/ anyways i was just wondering if this was normal or if im petty much fucked
