				This is a stupid rule, its killing vendors feedback on the forums (why do you care, I know), the only reason I spammed is to leave damn feedback for someone I bought from. If you need to write bullshit posts so you can thank a vendor by giving him positive feedback and informing the rest of the &quot;community&quot; about the vendors practices then whats the fucking point. <br /><br />Meanwhile &quot;BUY 10 BTC for $82.00&quot; can post anywhere they fucking want. That&#039;s the god damned spam.<br /><br />Fucking idiots.

				Also, I invite the person deleting all these posts to come have a meaningful conversation about the point of this, the reason we cant review vendors and why we must waste our time so we can get to the big boy board. After spending over a grand on the road Im treated like a little kid. Id like that explained as well.<br /><br />Thank you. But you&#039;re probably too busy deleting posts people are forced to post.

				it&#039;s a necessary evil. I don&#039;t like how it&#039;s being handled but I think there was a real issue with spam as well as illegitimate reviews and what not in the rumor-mill.

				Notice I still, until now, have not mentioned vendors. How much do vendors really post? <br /><br />So, someone pays $500 for an account and wants to advertise or promote a special or their wares in general. Now they cant, they have to post in a restricted forum where people with OVER 50 posts cant post. That&#039;s fair right?

				This really sucks, but for those of us who have already been using the Road for a while, and only using the forums sparingly, this is a one-time problem. We&#039;ll get to 50 posts eventually even if all the spam is deleted and we have to do it legitimately. Once we do, the problem is solved for our large group who were here when the rule changed. We are able to post at that point. And from then on it will only be a problem for new users, to whom it will appear like it was always this way.<br /><br />No offense, Alain, but I think it&#039;s a mistake for you to act as if you are entitled to post on a SR forum, or for that matter, to even use SR itself. DPR and his staff have gone out of their way to create something incredible here. They could&#039;ve made it so you could only join if you were invited, but they didn&#039;t. They made it open. There have always been problems and there will always be problems. The system isn&#039;t perfect. But if the board is having a problem with spam, I trust the staff to know what they&#039;re doing when they raise the minimum post count in response. At this point I think it&#039;s safe to say that they should have done this sooner, maybe when the forum was first created, in anticipation of these issues, and maybe that way they wouldn&#039;t have to try to appease people who got used to the way it was.<br /><br />This is a minor annoyance at best, and that&#039;s coming from a guy who only has 10 posts at the moment.

				Entitlement really has nothing to do with it, its the ineffectiveness of it, its hurting real users and not doing anything about the spammers. That&#039;s the point here, see my reply a couple posts up. Hey man, if it was invite only, then it would be a privilege to be part of SR and the forums (which it still is), but I guess having the ability to post (a week ago), then not, then having to go through and post 50 times (which would have taken me a year at the rate I was posting is not the way to fix spam. Just moderate the spammers. That is all.
