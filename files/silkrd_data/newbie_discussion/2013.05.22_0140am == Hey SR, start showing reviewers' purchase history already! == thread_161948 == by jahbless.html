				I&#039;m sure this issue will have been discussed before, but I wasn&#039;t able to find a relevant thread...<br /><br />Every day new sellers appear on SR offering great deals (esp on BTC for cash/money pack/western union etc). Some of these sellers are scammers and some are genuine traders. The problem is that it seems easy for a scammer to set up a few fake buyer accounts (many cash to BTC transations cost 0.00BTC anyway) to give himself fake positive reviews.<br /><br />This is why I was wondering... even if a seller&#039;s info page doesn&#039;t display his reviewers&#039; user names for privacy reasons, why doesn&#039;t SR let us see the other items these reviewers have purchased? (It&#039;s not like it would be easy to determine which user a given purchase history belongs to.) This way, when we see a glowing positive review, we can always click to see that reviewer&#039;s purchase history, and so have a little more confidence in his review being legit and reliable (or not...). <br /><br />Does this make sense to anyone? Has the idea been discussed and discarded before?

				you could even just colour code things, no need to give exact buyer stats, but some kind of idea would be useful.

				I thought that too once I made a purchase from a vendor with a good history, and then received fakes.&nbsp; There are still ways to link a user to a sale, that&#039;s the problem.

				yes, colour code might help.<br /><br />on the other hand, i wish at those feedbacks i could see who made them.<br />because then i could contact one or two and ask them about more details about the stuff.<br /><br />since on the other hand they have to be protected, there should be a chance that you contact them without knowing their SR user name<br />and when they answer they do it as well anonymously (like feedback #392546 or similar, so that i know which feedback it is, but dont know who the buyer was).<br /><br />like it is now, a lot of feedback seems fake to me.<br /><br />
