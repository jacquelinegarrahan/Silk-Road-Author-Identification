				Anyone do this? I&#039;m a little nervous, don&#039;t want to be kicked out in my first week, think I would feel ok with domestic but doesnt seem to be much around! Technohippy, feuk, Nelsonmuntz dont have any available, and symbiosis is selling only small amounts, and apparently dark purple? Think people will be a bit suspicious of purple mdma.

				Yes... at least so I&#039;ve read.<br /><br />And not to alarm you, I&#039;ve also read of some busts in said situation.&nbsp; Make sure you take all precautions like anywhere else... for example it wouldn&#039;t be wise to be sending yourself shit while you have a stash in there. <br /><br />Not sure what people would think of the purple... each locale seems to be different.

				Then use your name.<br /><br />Anyone can send you a package, right?... and just because you got sent something doesn&#039;t mean you had anything to do with it.&nbsp; If this wasn&#039;t the case, pissed off people would just send packages of coke to politicians they hated, and get them locked up.&nbsp;
