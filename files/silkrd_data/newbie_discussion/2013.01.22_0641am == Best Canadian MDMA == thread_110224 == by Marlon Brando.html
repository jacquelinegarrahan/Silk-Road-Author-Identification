				If the seller actually knows that they&#039;re doing properly in terms of stealth (and I don&#039;t mean just vacuum sealing) then the originating country can often be redundant.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0<br />^^ That is a great read and should help you a lot!<br />:)
