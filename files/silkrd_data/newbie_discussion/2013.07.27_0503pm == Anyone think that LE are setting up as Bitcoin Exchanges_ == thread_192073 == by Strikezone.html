				Lately there has been a lot of new exchanges setting up shop and giving low commission rates 2 - 4% comparing to others who are charging 12 - 15% This may be my paranoid thoughts kicking in. But wouldn&#039;t that be a good way for personal information to be gathered by LE to form cases against us.<br /><br />Keen to gather thoughts if any?<br /><br />

				There&#039;s nothing illegal about buying Bitcoins. If LE wanted to do that sort of sting it would make a lot more sense to set up a vendor account, since LE can&#039;t prove what you were planning to do with your Bitcoins after buying them. An analogy would be LE keeping track of all videocameras to bust people who film movies at the theater - just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />There are a bunch of anonymous Bitcoin purchasing services, so you could just use those as well.

				A lot of people actually uses bitcoins as an investment or as actual currency to buy legal stuff. I don&#039;t know why they would use it as an actual currency but investing in them might be worthwhile for some.

				See this is one of the reasons that the 50 posts for Newbies was introduced in the first place.<br />Always the same questions, where can I buy bitcoins, how do I use PGP, do I have enough security. <br />And then we have all the paranoid&#039;s who are convinced that LE or DEA are out to get them.<br />The first thing I tell people is to learn how to use the &quot;search&quot; facility, that is what it is there for. Chances are your question has been answered many times already, and using the search box is hardly rocket science.<br />Secondly, a little paranoia is good for you, keeps you up from becoming complacent, but too much will make you a nervous wreck.<br /><br />Understand this, bitcoins are currently legal, so no laws are being broken.<br />Do you really think that LE, DEA, ATF and all the other alphabet agencies have the resources to do the things that some of you seem&nbsp; to think they do.<br />Setting up as a bitcoin exchanger!! (LOL)<br />Use the search box and some common sense, otherwise stay away.

				Nah. Bitcoins aren&#039;t illegal. Without having knowledge of what address belong to SR, they can&#039;t pin specific coins on a person as the coins are laundered through SR&#039;s tumbler.
