				Hey guys,<br />I am brand new to silk road, ive done some buys with a friend in the past but this is my first few days on my own account. anyways after countless hours of researching about bitcoins, silk road, tormail, etc. I feel like I am getting pretty close to making my first order. However, I have a ? about getting bitcoins on bitinstant. Do you have to go through mtgox or someone like that or can you just select pay cash deposit from walmart and then pay to bitcoin address? I have set up a bitcoin wallet and know my bitcoin address..so now do i just deposit the money at walmart and pay it to my bitcoin addess being my bitcoin wallet, send those bitcoins to my SR wallet, and then make a purchase? I also noticed you can pay to your email and then send the bitcoins to your wallet but that seems like an unneccessary step similar to mt gox. Do you need mt gox or can you do it like i described previously? If someone could help me figure this out Id really appreciate it. I feel like im so close but so far away &gt;:( &gt;:(

				No, you don&#039;t need to go through Mt.Gox. For a while there Bitinstant had removed the option to pay to a bitcoin address, but it&#039;s back now and works just fine.

				Just have bitinstant transfer them directly to your wallet or if you use bitcoins to email they&#039;ll send you a link to retrieve your coins from a site called coinapult that you can then transfer them to your wallet. and I believe they use the exchange rate from mtgox at the rate it is at when the transaction processes. I&#039;ved used them alot and have had flawless results and the coins dont take longer then 15-20 minutes in my experience to show up. I do recommend you transfer your coins to another wallet before sending them straight to you SR address. Good luck on your first order, choose wisely and all will go smoothly. Welcome to the community my fellow traveler&nbsp; ;D

If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what are you interested in making as your first purchase? Mine was some delicious liquid Xanax spray from an amazing vendor SprayMan and some quite delectable CannaBrittle from LionWareTrading that all made it to me by 4/20. What an awesome day that was let me tell ya&nbsp; :P

				No you don&#039;t need Mt.Gox for this but you can expect 4% fee charged and then there&#039;s another fee also tagged on to it.&nbsp; Everyone of those places is a ripoff!!
