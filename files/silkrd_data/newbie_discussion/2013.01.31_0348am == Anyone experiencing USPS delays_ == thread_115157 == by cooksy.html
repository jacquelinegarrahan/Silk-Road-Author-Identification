				So my express package shipped on monday was supposed to be here tuesday, and here it is wednesday night and it still hasnt arrived. I have tracking for it and it just stops at &quot;depart sort facility&quot; which im pretty sure isnt even the right sort facility as all of my other orders came through another facility location. This really sucks cause the same thing happened last transaction and the vendor had to reship. Anyone else having problems?

				I have seen 1-2 days added to everything I have sent since Xmas.<br /><br />I figure the effects of all the facility closures are starting to hit.<br /><br />I am seeing alot of scans I didnt use to see .. Oakland, Philadelphia etc ... things taking new routes to customers I have shipped to multiple times

				Thanks for the reply fred. It really makes me wish there was some way to get around needing ID to ship with fedex or ups. Usps is becoming increasingly unreliable and its costing people a lot of money. I hate not knowing if my package is gonna get lost because of some careless jerkoff at the post office.
