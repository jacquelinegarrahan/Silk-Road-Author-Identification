				Hello everyone, new guy here. <br />Figured I would make my first post unique by seeing if people would send me 0.01btc? No reason really, just to see if there are people out there who would be willing to give 0.01btc (about $1usd) to a stranger, for no other reason than simply asking. Figured it can&#039;t hurt to try! <br /><br />1A3ffhygwtDDxhhpMqxiCffvFLff1fUWDB<br /><br />For the meantime I will roll around the forums and get comfortable. <br /><br />Glad to be part of the community now. I&#039;ll be back to update on my progress!<br /><br />Thank you in advance. :)

				Damn! You got hooked up. I am completely broke until August... that is torture when I just found out about SR this month. I made a few orders that went swimmingly and now I just peruse the site wishing I could purchase stuff. You&#039;re a lucky duck icecreamman... you better pay it forward.&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;d loan some btc to an established member, but just asking for it and having no record, there could be 100 accounts ran by the same person hitting all the other sites. I mean asking for something off a stranger, how many would go up to someone and ask for 50p? <br /><br />I never give to beggars in real life and get aggressive ones when I have to visit big cities. Usually clutching a can of special brew lager. Asking me to help them out when I&#039;m working just to pay the bills. I like lager sometimes but I work to buy some.<br /><br />And the guy asked for 0.01 btc and got that and 0.1 btc. <br /><br />Do that on ten - thirty other sites and you could make a living! That would be 3.1 btc! <br /><br />And when I first joined, in the spirit of genrosity I did hand out btc to passing people on the forum. How many paid back?<br /><br />Also we get the lend me 1 btc and I&#039;ll give back two. Bit high interest rates! There are a few members here who I guess would pay me back but I&#039;ve never asked and generally if I cannot afford it, then its not on the menu! I&#039;d never loan and want double back. <br /><br />I was told that you are best never to lend or borrow. <br /><br />But I got to borrow my neighbours hedge strimmer so -&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />And I did lend an hammer to another neighbour. Never known a man who has not got an hammer. We like to bang nails in walls. My wife cries abour ruining walls - but I hate drilling walls and using wallplugs. Its easy to just bang a nail in there.<br /><br />So, anyone got 1 btc to lend me - its for some orphans who have no heroin. Poor kids.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				I think the borrowing and begging option on SR is great. I mean, we can all agree that bitcoins are a pain in the ass. For my first order, I was going to get an OZ of mid-grade for cheap. I put the money in the account, with $10 over the amount, thinking that would be enough...it wasn&#039;t. I was .12 off from getting the order. I then went through Coagulator, who was going through hell, but managed to send me a hooked up amount of some really danky dank... so I can&#039;t complain. However, if I was in a situation where that mid-grade was all the I would want, I would&#039;ve been begging (or at least angry and working on establishing a reputation to where I feel comfortable coming to the forum and asking for the extra coin.) <br /><br />Also, if I&#039;m ever in a position to have some extra, I&#039;d more more than willing to help someone out without expecting anything in return.

				I wouldn&#039;t really mind if the money went to a scammer,&nbsp; the potential benefits to society of promoting a more <br />generous, philanthropic attitude outweigh the negatives of a useless cunt scammer getting some cash. I hope you&#039;ve both paid half on as requested.

				WTF. Having some login issues with the forums so new account created. <br /><br />Descarte, THank you! Definitely wasn&#039;t expecting that. Logged into SR and was like where did this come from???<br />So yes, it&#039;s being paid forward. In fact, what&#039;s your BTC addy and Jasper, yours as well? <br /><br />And on the note of that, let me ask....In the original post, I posted a non-SR wallet, but Descarte, yours came through to the SR wallet. Is there a way you can see/find someones SR wallet ID to send BTC to without them having to send it to you or post their addy?

				I had this great idea of keeping my user and forum names seperate so that i could remain anonymous<br />but as soon as you make a tranfer from SR your name goes with it.<br />Don&#039;t worry about paying me back, pass it on to someone else who needs it.

				What if we all did this?<br />I dont know if anyone has ever gave away bitcoin.<br />but begging should be discouraged i think its a waste of time.<br />We all could use .01 btc hell we could all use 100000.0 btc.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am just a guy that pays top dollar for a coin to spend and hope it does<br />not drop to much before I do.<br />But I have not had any luck so far.<br />seem to always drop after I buy.<br /><br />
