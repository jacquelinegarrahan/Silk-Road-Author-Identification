				I&#039;m going to cambodia later this week and want to try and find some opiates. I have heard the pharmacies are extremely relaxed when it comes to selling stuff otc and I was wondering what brand names should I be asking for?<br /><br />Also what parts of cambodia are the easiest to find heroin and opium? I am starting my trip in Penom Penh and will either head south toward the beach areas Sihounakville and Kampot or north west to Siam Reap. Does any have suggestions on which area would be better.<br /><br />Any other advice drug related or not about Cambodia would be great as well :)

				It is hard to find a pharmacy that you can trust.&nbsp; Benzos are sold all over the place but the big problem is that they are about 75% fake.&nbsp; They say &quot;Roche&quot; but do nothing at all, or are severely underdosed.&nbsp; Maybe someone local in Phnom Penh can weigh in on heroin or opium.&nbsp; I have a hunch that this city has most everything available.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if the &quot;arrest the caucasian&quot; game is played as often as in Thailand.&nbsp; I would find out before getting too brave.&nbsp; It sucks to be in a prison in a little shit third world country with no way out.

				My advice is to ask your hotel/guesthouse to recommend a motovcycle driver, and hire him for the day. Most drivers will offer to get you drugs or take you to brothels. Weed is easy to get, you can get pizza with shrooms on it in restaurants too. I was also offered acid and most other drugs, but stuck to my pizzas and pot. Check any online travel guides if you want to know where to get a happy pizza. As for pharms, I got valium and 30 mg codeine tabs no prob, but I haven&#039;t been in a few years. After Phnom Pehn, I would recommend Siem Riep and foing to Ankor Wat if this is going to be a one time visit. Either way, be safe.

				Having been in Cambodia for a month myself a few years ago - be careful! It&#039;s extremely corrupt and if you make an opportunity for anyone to blackmail you they will. Hopefully you know someone there and are not just a tourist on a week&#039;s vacation who is going to stomp around looking for drugs. Jasper mentioned some things to try if you don&#039;t know anyone but again be careful.<br /><br />Beautiful country and Ankor Wat is awesome but be ready to fight off the kids! They swarm you sometimes or&nbsp; did when we were there. Have fun!

				Having lived in Thailand for the last 6 yrs and a frequent visitor to Cambodia mainly to Phnom Penh I&#039;ve witnessed the changes for the worse over that time.<br />5 years ago you could get a gram of meth, china white heroin from one of the dealers on the lake side for $50 and quality was pretty good and &#039;I&#039;d say the China back then was close to uncut. Alot of changes since then especially last 2 yrs and the Americans building a big ANTI CORRUPTION centre and leading an anti corruption drive. Where as before the police on the lake side would take a pay off from the local dealers all that stopped and alot of dealers got locked up along with some of the senior people in the police force. <br />god bless America, the American paid for all the electronic finger printing equipment that is installed at the airport and border crossings, I believe all the data goes to the big US embassy there.<br />Prices these days are $100 for a gram of China white and Meth, if you get to know one of the local dealers and buy often you might get it down to $80 but it will of been stepped on a fair bit now days.<br />Luckily police stings are a lot less common than in thailand, a few months my guy there took to me to this place to buy some meth and we are outside these houses and 2 guys came up asking what i was doing there, undercover police guys and I said just looking for a guest house and have gotten lost. They said this place is well know for methamphetamine so go now! If that had of happened in thailand the cops would of waited for you to buy the stuff first then busted you and you&#039;d of been marched to the nearest atm to empty your bank account.<br />I think your best bet is still the lakeside, there are one or 2 guesthouses still open there and i&#039;d book a couple of nights in one of them and you&#039;ll be offered stuff from the people working there and tuk tuk guys outside. At least that way you aren&#039;t walking in and out of the place and doing a deal on the street. <br />Wouldn&#039;t bother with the random tuk tuk guys who are always pestering you to buy weed and most of it is shit stuff they buy for 30 cents and ask you $20 for.<br />

				Thanks for the reply, I think I might just stick to buying otc stuff from pharmacies rather than opium or heroin off the street. I don&#039;t know anyone and am going for a holiday not just to buy cheap drugs.<br /><br />Is it possible to get anything stronger than codeine or tramadol from pharmacies?
