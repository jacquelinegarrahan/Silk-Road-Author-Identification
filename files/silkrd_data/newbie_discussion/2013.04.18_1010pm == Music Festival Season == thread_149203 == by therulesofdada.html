				What festivals have you all been too/going to this upcoming season?&nbsp; Just curious what variety of music (particularly in the US of A) everyone is checking out.<br /><br />So far I myself was able to go to Sensation here in the US and Ultra in Miami.<br /><br />Looking forward to EDC and Electric Zoo in the upcoming months, and hopefully TomorrowWorld.<br /><br /><br />And remember....PLUR

It looks pretty rad just being surrounded by the heart of the city. The EDC I did in 2010 was the last one they were able to legally do in LA(a 16 year old girl OD&#039;ed and that was the last straw for the city so they moved to Las Vegas), but it was one of the best experiences of my life. I have never been to the Las Vegas version, but I would like to. Between EDC or Coachella for the west coast though, Coachella wins hands down, it was THE best experience of my life, ain&#039;t nothin like camping in southern California surrounded by the most beautiful scenery and people and music available. The grass is easily the softest grass I have ever stepped foot on, and the art and stage production is indescribable. There is something in the air there, I swear, you feel euphoric the entire time whether you are on drugs or not lol.. Bonnaroo is also great, because the music goes till the sunrise but it can get hot.

				Ultra and Ezoo have that same feel you are in the heart of two great cities and it gives you such an uplift you don&#039;t even need to roll or drink to be the happiest you have ever been.&nbsp; Going with groups of people definitely helps.<br /><br />

				I used to be crazy about music festivals. I still am, only I don&#039;t go anymore because most of my driving and ticket money goes to seeing Phish and Furthur. With these guys, it&#039;s as if I mainlined the jams and now nothing else is worth it. If I am a hopeless addict, then I do not want any hope. They are touring festivals in their own rights. Furthur are playing All Good, great lineup, but they&#039;re playing closer dates to me elsewhere. I would kill to be at Gathering of the Vibes for that Phil Lesh and Friends lineup, probably the best one since Phriends in 1999. I would also love to go to Camp Bisco because I hear it&#039;s a shit-show, and while I don&#039;t love the Disco Biscuits generally, they have some incredible jams I could really get into live.

				Well, my first and forever festival will be Global Dance Festival- Golden, Colorado. Red Rocks Ampitheatre is definitely the most beautiful, wonderful venue in the whole world. Perhaps it&#039;s because it&#039;s my home, but I&#039;ll always go back. This will be my third year.<br /><br />A lot of triad dragons, mostly: Hallowfreakenween 2011, Caffeine 2012, Decadence 2012-2013, Ultra 2013, and soon to be Dayglow 2013, EDC Las Vegas 2013, plus a lot of small shows. <br /><br />And I want so badly to go to Burning Man some time.

You volunteer before, after or during the festival and get a 100% refund for your ticket. Volunteer time is mostly according to your preference, and they take into account your top not-to-miss acts. If you don&#039;t mind picking up some garbage/directing traffic/sitting around waiting for people to ask you questions for a few hours, it&#039;s so so worth it.
