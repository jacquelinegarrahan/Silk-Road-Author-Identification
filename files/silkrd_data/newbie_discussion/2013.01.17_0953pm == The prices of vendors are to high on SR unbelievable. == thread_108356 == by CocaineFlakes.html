				Quit bumping your own thread. You don&#039;t have a vendor account yet, you don&#039;t have a right to post this.<br /><br />When you get your vendor account, post in the product offer subforum.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can spam 8 posts in a week.

				See? You&#039;re already there, when you reply to this and bump your thread again you&#039;ll be able to post in the general forum and you won&#039;t be able to post here anymore. :)&nbsp; Might wanna delete this since you can&#039;t respond to any potential customers.<br /><br />Also, PLEASE don&#039;t post in the product offers page until you get your vendor account, it&#039;s already too clogged with threads like that.

				The prices are high, the quality is better (in my experience) and the risk is lower. No complaints from me.

				It really sucks when you sent coins from a trader to Silk Road and end up less than a coin short. Any chance someone could send me 0.1 bitcoins so I can make an order? I&#039;ve been able to help out someone before and was just hoping someone may return the favor.&nbsp; <br /><br />1G56C8Gcon1KneNJK61GTfVfsHeNgtBJtH<br />

				i disregard the fact of how noob you are to vend on a newbie forum and you don&#039;t even have vendors account, lol.<br /><br />The ocaine prices on SR are actually fair and reasonable for low quantities, especially the quality you get as opposed to the cut up bullshit you get from the streets. However, the bulk prices (anything above 8ball - 5g) are fcking ridiculous. Your prices aren&#039;t even better than the ones on SR lol <br /><br />On a side note: MDMA prices on SR are a great bargain, especially from the dutch vendors. However delivering from NL may be a huge hassle for many people due to strict customs that keep an eye out for countries known for manufacturing and trafficking.
