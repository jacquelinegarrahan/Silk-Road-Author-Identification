				It is an option with some BTC wallet software like Bitcoin QT, the Armory, etc. Obviously you can&#039;t encrypt an online wallet like easywallet.org or instawallet.org. For maximum security, I&#039;d just use a paper wallet that was generated on a live CD on a PC that&#039;s never connected to the internet. Even if your wallet is encrypted if they have a keylogger on your PC, they will record your password. <br />To make a paper wallet, go to www.brainwallet.org and save the web page. It is in javascript and can run offline <br />on any web browser with javascript enabled. Just generate the new wallet offline and print it out.<br />all you need to save is the private key. When you want to send money, go to transactions and do an offline transaction (historical transactions must be updated online) you can copy and paste from an online computer (blockchain or blockexplorer). <br /><br />When you get the raw transaction, save the text to a CD. And then put the CD in an online computer and push the transaction through blockchain or blockexplorer. I will write a detailed guide on this soon and post here on the forum for the newbies.

				wow...that just seems like quite a bit to do.&nbsp; Right now I am using different wallets via blockchain and sending them to SR from there.&nbsp; Is that not a safe option for storing bitcoins?

				It&#039;s possible that Blockchain could be compromised or somebody could find your credentials and log in as you.<br /><br />Personally I only ever have a few bitcoins at a time so it&#039;s not really an issue for me but if I was holding large amounts then I&#039;d be looking at some of the methods p3nd8s has outlined above.
