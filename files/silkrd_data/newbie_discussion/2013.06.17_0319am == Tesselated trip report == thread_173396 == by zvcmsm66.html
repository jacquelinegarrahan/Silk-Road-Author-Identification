				Let me start this off by letting you all know this was my first experience with LSD, and Tess has absolutely given this wonderful substance a very very good name. Not to mention the transaction with this vendor was flawless.<br />It was a sunny Friday afternoon at my place, along with me were my s/o (first timer as well), his friend (experienced), and his friends s/o (experienced). We ate a good meal and then dropped at about 3pm. I was the first to feel the effects, only after waiting almost an hour, everything suddenly became more intriguing, funnier, and the colors of everything around me were amazing. Soon after my s/o began to feel it, and we both couldn&#039;t stop laughing about it. The other two started to feel it after that, and once we all were sure that each of us were tripping, the fun really started. We mostly spent the entire day from 3-11pm outside beside the pool, but there would be times in between where we would wonder off as a very disorganized group to either the front yard, living room, or kitchen. We even took a nice evening drive through a secluded subdivision and the ride was so exhilarating, it could&#039;ve been compared to a space ship. There were times where things would get so overwhelming, but not in the crazy way, but just looking at the rainbow colors of a Lucky Charms cereal box was just so much fucking awesomeness to take in. Eating ice-cream was also a challenge for our friends, who exclaimed that there were too many tastes that it was impossible to focus on one. Everything I focused on became a kaleidoscope of random shapes, objects, faces, and colors. I was sitting in my bathroom for a good 20 minutes staring at the shower until someone walked in and caught me focusing as hard as I could at an empty shower. While outside in the yard, we had speakers jamming out The Beatles station&nbsp; on Pandora, whenever they played Hey Jude, I laid back and watched the trees grow out into the sky to the melody of the song. There were so many highlights of this trip, I can&#039;t even begin to start on HALF of them. I am so eager to make another order with Tess for my next trip coming up soon. Forever my go-to-vendor. I love you Tess, and I love your product. :-*

				Another Trip Report:<br /><br />For some time I&#039;ve been reading about LSD and psychedelic experiences in general. After much reading, investigating and meditation; I decided to place an order from Tess. Everything went perfect with my order (as all his orders do).<br /><br />One Saturday, after much thought, me and my wife agreed for me to try the acid. I read that it was good for you to have the day off both the day of the experience and the day after, so you can &quot;digest&quot; and meditate about everything you go through. <br /><br />Me and my wife weren&#039;t sure about the timing being good, since I had been going through a really profound depression for the past 2 months! (I suffer from moderate depressions once or twice a year, but this one was one of the most important ones in my life). I tell my wife I want to go forward with it, she agrees. <br /><br />At about 2:00 pm, after lighting some incense and an aromatic candle, I put one single dose of Tess&#039; acid under my tongue for about 20 minutes, after that I just swallowed the thing with a sip of water, and decided to just lie on my bed to relax and listen to some music until the effects kicked-in (of course, this was impossible for me). <br /><br />At around 2:30pm I started to feel a bit anxious an started to note my heart frequency to accelerate. At this point I am not &quot;Hallucinating&quot;, but I clearly feel that something is about to happen. My heartbeat is going really fast (I am a very anxious guy), my legs feel a bit week and overall, I am feeling a bit restless. At about 2:40pm I decide to get out of the room and sit next to my wife in the couch, and just talk to her (she is a very calmed and centred person, and although she has never even smoked a normal cigarette in her life, I know for some reason that she is going to understand me and that she is going to make me feel better).<br /><br />She sits on the couch and I just lie next to her, with my head on her lap (I also read that contact with a trusted one helps you feel safe and maintain a sort of connexion with &quot;reality&quot;). After 2 - 3 minutes I go from nervous (almost scared) to feeling positive. We&#039;re probably 10 - 15 minutes sitting there just talking. I start to feel that it&#039;s getting harder and harder for me to think clearly and to speak clearly, but this doesn&#039;t worry me all that much. I remember someone&#039;s testimony about his LSD experience and the way he felt about taking a shower while on LSD, so I decide to take a shower my self. It wasn&#039;t that cool for me (probably because I still wasn&#039;t high enough, and because of the weakness in my legs). After i dry up, I look my self in the mirror for a few seconds, still no crazy hallucinations. While looking at my self straight in the eye, I blink, and that blink seemed to last for an eternity, and not only that, I felt as if I was looking at another person (even though some part of me knew exactly that that was my reflection on the mirror), and I actually saw that person (me) blink in slow motion after I had actually blinked. This was a bit too much (though not precisely scary) for a beginner, so I went back to my wife and the couch.<br /><br />I calculate it&#039;s about 3:15pm (time is really doing weir things in my mind now). I stare out the window, and trees seem different, it is as if they had more leafs, and that their color is more neat, so then I remember another guy&#039;s statement about his experience with psychedelics, and he wrote that one looks at a tree and sees a stem and a &quot;greenish round top&quot;, but that after his psychedelic experience, he was actually conscious about each and every leaf, each branch, the complexity of the stem, etc. So I think that&#039;s what seemed different about the trees in front of my building.<br /><br />Everything looks more neat now, so I know that the effects are really kicking-in now. I am now feeling really positive, but something (or someone) in the back of my mind is really cautious still. I am walking around the house looking, smelling and touching everything.<br /><br />Time is meaningless right now, looking back now, I think it was about 4:00 pm. I decide to look at my self in the mirror again, so I walk to the bathroom. I look my self straight in the eyes again, I see a strange sad expression on my face (probably because of the depression I&#039;d been going through), about to cry I quit looking at my self in the eyes. I start looking at my face and body, and I start seeing each wrinkle, each mark on my face more in detail, also, my body starts to look funny though I can&#039;t tell exactly why (I wash´t liking this). I turn away and go back to my wife (I feel more than ever that she&#039;s my guardian, and that I am safe with her).<br /><br />We lie on our bed and start talking about something I can&#039;t remember now. I don&#039;t mention the experience looking at the mirror. 15 - 20 minutes go by and I start feeling an urge to close my eyes and just let my mind wander. I let my self go, and I star to see the most beautiful and unthinkable forms swirl around me. At first they weren&#039;t too neat, but after a minute or two, they started to look really clear, and move more and more furiously. So there I am, sitting on the edge of the bed, eyes closed, just laughing (the kind of laugh when you&#039;re really amazed by something) at the incredible display of colors and forms. First they were yellow and blue metallic letters of some strange language, then they would change to orange, then to a rainbow-like sequence. It was one of the most beautiful and unimaginable experiences I&#039;ve ever been through. At one point they get so incredibly impressive, that I feel they&#039;re taking my breath away. When it was too much for me (it was my first psychedelic experience) I would open my eyes to catch my breath. I do this for what seems to be an eternity. Incredible. <br /><br />After a while, for some reason I remember a part of &quot;Timothy Leary&#039;s Tibetan Book Of The Dead&quot; where he says that if you put you ear in to someone else&#039;s chest and hear his heartbeat and respiration you actually connect with them (not exactly those words, but that was the basic idea), so I put my ear on my wife&#039;s chest and close my eyes again. I concentrate on her heartbeat and respiration, and I start seeing the metallic swirls again for a moment, but then they turn to metallic-fuchsia and stay that way, and slow down to match the pace of her heart. Then the swirls start to feel more &quot;significant&quot; (it&#039;s the best word I can come up for it), and I feel as if my wife was made of that metallic-fuchsia entity, so I tell her &quot;you&#039;re fuchsia on the inside&quot; and she makes an expression as if that were a weakness, and I tell her &quot;metallic-fuchsia&quot; and close my fist and make an expression like Tiger Woods winning the US Open. These swirls felt to me very powerful at the beginning (when they were yellow and blue, and rainbow-like), but when they where coming from my wife (metallic fuchsia) they just felt darn invincible.<br /><br />We go to the living room again, and I look through the window again, everything is just alive. Colors are vibrant, everything is just beautiful. Everything just makes me laugh in amazement. Anything I stare at just takes my breath away. I sit on the couch and get lost in my mind again, contemplating. Then my wife comes&nbsp; with a dish of Hummus and Pita. My mouth just waters instantly, I smell the bread like never before. I take a piece of pita and dip it in the Hummus and stare at it. I start feeling something I never even imagined possible. I was realising the true meaning of bread for the first time. I realised how bread was the basic food for millennia for nations all over the globe. How entire civilisations had disappeared because of bad crops and not having this often given-for-granted food. I tear apart the piece I&#039;ve been contemplating, and have another &quot;transcendental revelation&quot;, I realise that bread is made of actual crumbs, and that those crumbs are as important as the bread it self. I put a piece in my mouth and I&#039;m about to cry (as a matter of fact, I&#039;m about to cry writing this) and feel that it is by far, the most delicious thing I&#039;ve ever eaten. I look at the piece I have in my hand still, and tear it apart as well, and now I see that those crumbs that make bread bread are actually made of smaller components and that those are made of molecules and molecules of atoms, each one with their unique and essential function to make bread what it is; and that were all atoms and molecules and crumbs in this bread-like universe, each one with our unique and most important function. I kept eating, almost crying for what seemed to be years.<br /><br />Music had been playing this whole time, and every now and then I would tell my wife to change the song playing because I didn&#039;t like the mood it put me in. By now, music was just incredible. I really love music, and I really enjoy listening to it, but that day, music was at the least epic. <br /><br />I stare out the window for another eternity and birds flying by leave the most impressive tracers every time. My wife sits again next to me in the couch and I lie with my head in her lap again. That makes me feel incredibly good and secure. I continue to look through the window, and clouds start to transform into animals of all different kinds. At one point one piranha-like cloud is trying to eat another cloud that was just minding her own business, but her mouth isn&#039;t big enough, so the piranha cloud gets even bigger and opens her mouth wider. At that point I say to my self &quot;look at this, who on earth do they think they are?&quot;, and my wife (who is completely sober) starts laughing madly, I think she kind of knew what I was seeing and what I was thinking.<br /><br />After some time, I get up and head to the fridge to make a culinary reconnaissance. I pick an orange and one of those bold knives. Until now, I&nbsp; hadn&#039;t realised how complex an orange&#039;s peel really was. All those pores, the smell, its color. I tried to look for something in our current era that would resemble the orange color in an orange; there&#039;s nothing on earth that is as orange as an orange. I start to peel that amazing gift from nature, and every piece i peel off feels as if I had accomplished a really important task, something that I really needed to do for my self.&nbsp; It was an incredible feeling. I finish peeling the orange, and cut a small piece and eat it. I didn&#039;t even register how it really tasted, because I was so immersed in to the fact of what I had accomplished. I remember staring out the window (again) as I was eating that &quot;important&quot; orange, and I felt that I was looking at my self from a couple of meters away. That &quot;me&quot; that was looking at my other &quot;me&quot; eating an orange, felt incredibly proud of him and what he had done for himself. The kind of proudness that almost makes you feel a little sad. It was weir because I kind of felt sad and happy at the same time, but overall, it was an incredibly good experience.<br /><br />Feeling more confident and proud of my self after that orange, I wanted to look at my self in the mirror again, so I get up and walk to the bathroom. Again, I look my self in the eyes. This time was different, no wrinkles, no marks on my face, and specially, no sad face. I looked GOOD, I liked this &quot;me&quot;. I examined my whole body, and it was as if I were stronger both physically and psychologically. My arms and torso looked more muscular, and I had this half-smile on my face that I really liked. I couldn&#039;t believe what I was seeing. I had never felt good looking my self in the mirror. I went to the living room again and thought to tell my wife what had just happened, but I couldn&#039;t think of the right words, so I just looked at her and smiled. <br /><br />After that, I told her I was ready to go for a walk. We got dressed and headed out. The world was different. We got out of the building and went to cross the street right in front of it, and the sun and a couple of clouds came out from behind the building next to ours, it was too much. I couldn&#039;t help it. I stood in the middle of the street looking at that miracle happening in front of us. My wife had to pull me from my sleeve. I kept saying &quot;woah&quot;, &quot;jesus&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;. She asked me for a kiss to try to distract me from acting like a moron. After a couple of minutes I got that I was acting crazy and people might notice, so I made an effort and tried to pretend that an absolute miracle was not happening everywhere I turned my eyes to. We took a cab to a park a few miles from our house, were they have this bar/restaurant with an outdoor terrace we like a lot. It was incredible, at one point I almost broke one of my wife&#039;s ribs when I hit her with my elbow trying to make her notice how green grass was, or how intense flowers looked. a couple of hundred meters before arriving to the park it self, I tell the taxi driver &quot;here&#039;s fine&quot; and practically jumped out the car before it even got to a full halt. I start looking at the trees on the sidewalk and thought I was in another world, and those weren&#039;t even the most impressive trees on the park. Crazy. We sat on the terrace and ordered two beers. Obviously, that beer was the best beer I&#039;ve had in my life. I spent what seemed to be hours looking at the bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass. It was magical. While on the terrace, a strange thing happened, I started to have this weir sensation. I could hear each and every one of the conversations happening around me. It wasn&#039;t too uncomfortable, but I felt it was distracting me from enjoying the park and its indescribable beauty. After an hour or so, I told my wife I wanted to go home, and we did. <br /><br />Once back home, I start feeling a bit nostalgic because I&#039;m already noticing I&#039;m &quot;coming down&quot;, but this feeling is quickly replaced for feelings of gratefulness and fortunateness. After an hour or two, we agree to go to bed. I feel a bit restless, but it didn&#039;t worry me too much. When I closed my eyes I still saw some flashes of light and coloured figures, but obviously not as intense as a couple of hours before. It must have been at least two hours before I could fall asleep. The next day, even though I only slept about 5 hours, I woke up feeling incredibly good. A bit tired, but really good. <br /><br />This chemical, if used responsibly and in the correct context, can provide for an incredible and heavenly experience without a doubt. If not, it can provide for exactly the opposite. A short previous study of matters related to psychedelic experiences and a minimum dose of common sense, and everything should be fine.<br /><br />I must thank my wife for being there, for making this experience possible, for loving me like she does, especially that day, and for looking after me; no doubt I was doubly blessed. I love her more than ever now. <br /><br />Tess made it really easy too. Even though I was a complete idiot with everything, he was very patient and willing to help, he was always available, and tried to make everything easy every time. I am most grateful to him as well, and wish him all the best.
