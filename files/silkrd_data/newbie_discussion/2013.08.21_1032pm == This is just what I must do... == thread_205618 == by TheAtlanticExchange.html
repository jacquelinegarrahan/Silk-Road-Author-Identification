				Post5 - Always rate your vendors accurately based on overall service, quality of product, and how carefully their stealth was employed.&nbsp; Nobody is perfect... but you wouldn&#039;t know it by how people rate their vendors!<br /><br />There are more options than just 1/5 or 5/5!&nbsp; USE THEM ON ME&nbsp; (Jk, I aim for 5/5)

				Post7 - It&#039;s best to use a &#039;drop&#039;, meaning, it&#039;s best to have another person of no relation to you accept your incoming packages.&nbsp; This person aught to be someone you trust with your life as they will very much be able to end it, if they wanted to.&nbsp; They also aught to be someone with a CLEAN record, this way IF you were to ever have a parcel with their name on it go missing and an investigation were started, you could &quot;cut ties&quot; on that level, play it cool, and have that investigation lead no where, you know... without sweating bullets for the rest of your drug-dealing career. ;)&nbsp;
