				Ok I am really fucking frustrated right now.<br /><br />I run tails through a CD so I can&#039;t download any programs, and I don&#039;t plan on running it through a USB.<br /><br />Using the OPENPGP Encription Applet, how can I encrypt messages to vendors? I have their public key, and that is all I have. How can I encrypt a message using the openpgp applet. I have been looking for two or three hours now. I know I am a fucking idiot for not being able to catch on. <br /><br />Does anyone care to offer a walkthrough? I have searched the fourm and internet, can&#039;t find anything clear cut.

				Hi, yeah i was banging my head off the wall with it til i came on here...i was informed that GPG4usb was a good one to use...it was easy to install and i,m hopeless with this kind of thing...i received a post and found it incredibly helpful...within an hour or so i had sent my first encrypted msg and then managed to decrypt one back...Here is a copy of that info i was given, hope it helps you <br /><br />&#039;if it helps, i was having a bit of a problem getting a handle on it, and rustykoin pm&#039;d me some simple instructions that filled in the gaps i had in the tutorial&#039;s instructions - i&#039;ve copied and pasted them below. At the bottom i&#039;ve added my public key in case you want to test encrypt some text and post. Just remember, you&#039;ll need to use my public key to encrypt a message to me, as i have the private key associated with that public key. If you want to receive an encrpted message, after opening gpg4usb, generate your own public key (as in rustykoin&#039;s instructions below, and post it.<br /><br />Okay first forget about the whole Clipboard deal you mentioned, gpg4usb has the whole deal. Now open your gpg4usb and just paste my whole public key in there, like I said in the window that looks like a text editor. Even where it says BEGIN PGP PUBLIC and down to where it says END PGP PUBLIC, the whole thing. Now if you look at the menu bar at the top where it says Keys, click that and go to Import Keys and finally click Clipboard. If you&#039;ve done it right then it should pop up with my name and even my tormail address and then add it to your chain.<br /><br />Okay, so now&nbsp; that you&#039;ve got that done what you want to do it clear all that crap out of the Clipboard and type a short message, could be anything. After you&#039;re done with your message make sure to click the check box next to my name (on the right side key chain list) and finally click the Encrypt button. This produces a mass of gibberish that I can only decode with my private key.<br /><br />Okay, now what you want to do is copy that gibberish and send it to me in the next message you send me. I&#039;ll let you know if you&#039;ve done it right. Meanwhile, send me your public key and I will send you an encrypted message that you can decrypt.<br /><br />If you&#039;re unsure on how to create keys, I&#039;ll break it down quickly. As soon as you open the program a wizard should pop up instructing you to create a key pair, if it does not then click on the Help menu button and select Open Wizard. Click the first next to keep everything in English and then select Create New Key Pair, the first option in blue. Click on the Create New Key button and it will pop up with a variety of info to fill out.<br /><br />I suggest you use a tormail.org email account for your keys to keep them further secure. Also make sure to create a strong password as you will be prompted each time you try to Decrypt a message someone sends you, and this adds an extra layer of security. Finally make sure to click the Never Expires check box next to the date.<br /><br />As soon as you fill out your info and password the program will create your public and private keys, this will only take a second. In order to preview your public key after it&#039;s created click on Manage Keys and select the check box next to your newly created key, then choose Export to File. Name it anything you want, but my suggestion is tbart Public.txt or something, but as long as it is a text file. Now you can go find your file, open it up and there is your public key which you can give to people in order to send you messages. Never give out your private key to anyone, it is only for you.<br /><br />The way PGP works is that your public key encrypts messages that only your private key can decrypt. That is why it is so secure, because even if the message was intercepted then no one would be able to crack it because they don&#039;t have your private key.&#039;

				Gave it a try, don&#039;t believe GPG4USB to work for me as I am running just a tails disc, not a USB.<br /><br />When I downloard it and click on start windows as the walkthrough says, i am taken to a whole different page with three options (none of which take me to my destination) instead of just the straight for an open textblock area.
