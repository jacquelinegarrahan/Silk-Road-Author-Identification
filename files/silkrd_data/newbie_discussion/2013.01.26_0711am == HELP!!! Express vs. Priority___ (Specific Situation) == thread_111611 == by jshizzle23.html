				I just had my first purchase shipped Express (thinking it would be overnight as the USPS website &quot;Guaranteed&quot;).&nbsp; Of course, it was shipped Wednesday before deadline and arrived FRIDAY (but still before noon, so whatever...)&nbsp; This was before I found these wonderful things called forums.&nbsp; I live in a neighborhood that has community mailboxes and I don&#039;t have access to it.&nbsp; FastForward (a most awesome vendor that has inspired me to get to 50 so I can leave an awesome review) was willing to not waive signature to insure it came directly to the door.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed other packages shipped here are left at the door (amazon shipments, etc.) but I&#039;m afraid mine will go to the mailbox and possibly be intercepted by the nosy family member that I&#039;m living with that suspects I have a drug problem and would be suspicious of a random package being delivered to me.<br /><br />Sooooo, my SR friends, what is your opinion of my situation and how should i handle it in the future?<br /><br />PS - I&#039;ve tried to open a PO Box at a few places, but they&#039;ve been VERY strict about the ID policy - I even tried one online and they asked for ID when I went to FE (lol - my first SR joke...)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!!

				Just get a PO box with the two forms of ID. Anyone can open one and if a package is seized you&#039;ll just get a pink love letter. Then you find somewhere else to ship. Deal with those problems when they come.

				So... you don&#039;t want to get a PO box because you&#039;ll have to give them your ID... but you&#039;ve asked a vendor to NOT waive signature, guaranteeing that you will have to sign for it? You&#039;re going about this in a very strange way. I recommend that you search these forums for information about PO boxes, read other users&#039; experiences and see if that method is right for you. If not, you might need to find alternative living arrangements unless you can somehow gain access to your community mailbox. But keep in mind these nosy roommate situations pretty much never work out the way you want them to. It&#039;s better to be creative, think of something else.<br /><br />23 Skidoo :)

				So, its not a big deal to use your real name and info and have narcotics sent to you and have them seized?? I mean, I have a pretty low fear factor in this whole thing due to the fact that I&#039;m only sending small amounts and I don&#039;t think they&#039;re really examining my parcel for a half gram of BTH or a gram of Molly, but I&#039;d prefer not to use my real info if I don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; Any recommendations for where to get the PO Box??&nbsp; USPS? UPS Store?&nbsp; Mom &amp; Pop shop that&#039;ll call me when my package gets there?&nbsp; Also, what about the places that you can use their address for package deliveries (monthly fee) and they just call you when your package arrives?<br /><br />LEMME KNOW! =)<br /><br />To mezzanine2323 : the not waiving signature was a one time thing, as I needed a fix and didn&#039;t want to risk it -- thus why I&#039;m looking for alternative solutions.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply, though. =P

If a package addressed to you is intercepted, you will get a letter about it, and it&#039;s recommended that you abandon that address at least temporarily.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111611.msg763665#msg763665">Quote from: jshizzle23 on January 26, 2013, 07:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Any recommendations for where to get the PO Box??&nbsp; USPS?

That doesn&#039;t make them liable. The point of SR and the anonymity behind it, is so no one can detect you are having them sent to you.
