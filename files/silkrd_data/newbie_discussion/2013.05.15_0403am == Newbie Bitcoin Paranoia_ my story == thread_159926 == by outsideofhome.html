				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I am a newbie and a bit paranoid. I did my due diligence, figured out pgp, etc. and was preparing for my first purchase on SR. I live in Canada, so it seems the best &quot;mainstream&quot; way to get bitcoins is VirtEx (I am not interested in face-to-face cash-for-coins). But it was taking awhile to get verified, and I was impatient to get my sticky paws on some bitcoins, and I decided that a Canadian seller on localbitcoins.com who had good reviews and would accept interac e-transfer would be an okay way to go. I find someone with decent reviews, OTC status, and I do the deal. Everything works out - no problem. Or so I thought. The next day, I get a call from the fraud department at my bank. They give me 20 questions, asking me about who this person is, etc. I try to stonewall them but they are very pushy. They want to know how I know this person and what was the transfer for. I tell them it was an authorized transaction and that I want to leave it there. They insist there are have been complaints about the other party and they want to know what the transfer was for. Eventually I let them know that this was an authorized transaction for purchase of a small quantity of bitcoins, and that seems to satisfy them. Needless to say, I will be going with VirtEx in the future (now verified with them and ready to go).<br /><br />But I have lingering paranoia. I do not trust the banks. Is it possible that my bank has alerted LE to me? Might my mail be scrutinized now?<br /><br />Please tell me I am just being paranoid.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />-Outsideofhome

				Sounds like paranoia to me.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Remember there is nothing illegal about buying and using bitcoins. This means if the bank did notify LE for some reason (which they didn&#039;t), LE will not care anyway.

				They didn&#039;t contact LE.&nbsp; As said before, buying BTC is totally legal.&nbsp; If I were you I&#039;d have told them to fuck off.&nbsp; Hate banks.

				With&nbsp; the recent explosion in bitcoin prices, people are flocking to the market.&nbsp; Nothing unusual about jumping in.&nbsp; I would not be afraid to show my face at any bank.&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t be afraid bitcoin can be used in many stores and for some it is a high risk investment currency. Nobody is notified about your purchase.
