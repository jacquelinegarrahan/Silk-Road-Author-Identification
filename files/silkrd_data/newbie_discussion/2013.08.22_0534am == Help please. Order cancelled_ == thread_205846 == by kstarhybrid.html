				I made my first purchase on SR yesterday. <br />Today when I logged in, under &#039;orders&#039; there&#039;s nothing listed. does that mean my order&#039;s been cancelled??<br />No communication from seller as to order being cancelled...

				Do you have your coins back?<br />There should be a message from SR if the vendor cancelled?<br />Did it ever go from processing to in-transit?

				if it was cancelled then you should have your coins back unless you finalized early.. but unlikely.

				Did you FE and leave feedback? In that case the order is considered finished and will disappear from that page. Otherwise, usually you will get an automated PM telling you the order&#039;s been cancelled. Has the amount of BTC you put in escrow been returned to your account balance at the top of the page? That would be another clue it was cancelled.

				Heard back from seller. <br />Said that they cancelled my order because I hadn&#039;t finalized early. (I finalized early, straight after purchasing.. as that was a requirement they had) <br />Told them I did finalize early..<br />They said I&#039;m all good then.<br />But if the order&#039;s been cancelled.. then shouldn&#039;t I get a refund so I can re-order or whatever. Idk I got a weird feeling bout this.<br />

				Ok so, if you finalize early, then whatever you&#039;ve purchased won&#039;t be listed under &quot;orders&quot;?

				Ok thanks for your help. Sorry, very new to this. <br /><br />It&#039;s not planetexpress. The seller told me that they sent it out last night. (even though they said just then that yes they had cancelled it) Fuuuuuck this.

				That&#039;s unacceptably unprofessional, even by the standards of the morass that is SR. Could be a scam, though some of these guys just enjoy too much of their product it seems. Don&#039;t order from anyone until you&#039;ve read every thread about them in the forums, and most all of it was positive. If you can&#039;t find any info on them, don&#039;t fuck with it, especially as a newbie.

				That is very weird id go change my feedback to state that you finalized early but they said they cancelled etc so others can see what happened maybe change it to a 3/5 untill your package arrives, good luck

				Thanks unbeknownst and everafterglow good advice. <br />There weren&#039;t any bad ratings, it&#039;s all 5/5 but the history of feedback only goes back 3 weeks and everyone&#039;s been F/E.<br />Purchases in future will be with reputable people who have been on here a while. And no more F/E.

				if you are new and they asked you to fe, and you did, then the order is completed on sr. now you just have to wait for it to show up. maybe the vendor was confused by the message you sent. id wait a few days to see if it shows up.

				yeah, I didn&#039;t end up changing my feedback. Am going to wait it out and see how it goes. <br />Seller has communicated with me and said they had to cancel a lot of orders and said that she/he thought I was one of them but I wasn&#039;t. There&#039;s been discussion about the seller possibly being a scammer today by other members.. but nothing concrete. We&#039;ll see.

				give it a few days, your money is already gone one way or the other. you can always change your feedback and report them in the next few days. which you should do if it doesnt arrive.
