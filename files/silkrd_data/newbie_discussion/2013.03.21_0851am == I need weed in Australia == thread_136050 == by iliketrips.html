				Keep an eye out for Aceman123 when they list again.. They tend to seel out very quick so its a bit of a pain but they are worth it. The best vendor I have used for Weed in the time I have been here (9 odd months I think now and 30+ transactions total &gt;2500 USD.. more by now but yeah)<br /><br />Good weed, honest listings, accurate pictures of product from batch to batch, prompt service and good stealth that doesn&#039;t, or at least didn&#039;t my last order (1/2 oz) , compress the buds. Oh and about normal pricing (not SR normal either.. the good normal) but I am yet to receive the exact amount ordered with 3 of 4 orders I have had with them being a fair chunk overweight and the 4th just ~7% over!! so really works out cheaper than normal... <br /><br />Reminds me of my old dude IRL that I purchased from starting @12 years old (don&#039;t judge now.. ) and only stopped when I moved city/state a lil bit back. Basically I saw the dude for min a Q very other day for 15+ years... still makes me go &#039;fuq man... that was a massive good find... the most reliable and honest weed dude in the whole country I reckon&#039;&nbsp; they never went out of stock but the same ethics and good nature that made my old&nbsp; old mate the most consistent thing I have ever had in my life are reflected in the way Aceman does his thing so I am equally amazed at the luck of finding them<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/27ad6e5e35<br /><br />shit there is feedback on a MDMA item... That would be the ducks nuts if they got a wider product range AND kept their awesome rolling... <br /><br />Oh he gets a pass on not updating the vendor info cause he had a car accident and broke (?) his wrist BUT is still pumping orders out it looks like from feedback..<br /><br />this 1/2 I got just seems to be lasting about 2.5x as long as normal so I haven&#039;t had to order for a while so out of the loop a bit.. but yeah I thank the drug gods for showing me this vendor... you will thank me after the first order you get from him too!

				It seems that all the good weed vendors end up selling out way too quick and can&#039;t keep up with the demand. I remember when HalfBaked just started out and he&#039;s the only one still here from about a year ago. There were some excellent vendors last year that took some time off over chrissy but haven&#039;t re-appeared again. And as for Aceman123, lets hope he gets back up and running soon.
