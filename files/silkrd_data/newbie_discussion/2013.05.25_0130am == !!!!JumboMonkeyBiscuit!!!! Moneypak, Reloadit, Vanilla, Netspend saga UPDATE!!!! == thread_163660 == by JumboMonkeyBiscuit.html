				Hello SR family... We are announcing that we have begun turning the corner on the Re-loadable debit card saga. For those of you that have been asking about bitcoin purchases using either:<br /><br />Moneypak<br /><br />Reloadit<br /><br />Vanilla Reload<br /><br />Netspend<br /><br />We had to implement a minimum amount of $500.00 just a couple of weeks ago. The reason for this was these re-loadable companies listed above are making it harder and harder to use their product to consistently purchase bitcoin from a stable and solid anonymous source. We have however begun to transition into our current payment processing methods with them to continue using their product that our customers love so much. <br /><br /><br />(((((((((((&nbsp; &nbsp;OUR NEW LOWER MINIMUM IS CURRENTLY $300.00&nbsp; &nbsp;))))))))))<br />We hope to continue to lower it as we move forward. Our percentage is non negotiable using any of the reloadable cards listed above.<br /><br /><br />However to offset these costs to all of us, we have begun taking CASH orders via mail. How much more anonymous does it get then mailing CASH? It&#039;s also processed at much lower rate than the re-loadable cards.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We look forward to working with everyone soon.<br /><br />Thank you <br /><br />JmB<br />

				Just purchased a 200$ reloadit and about to try this with jumbo for the first time. I&#039;m hoping this works so i can never have to use Bitinstant again. I hate to contribute to their profit after they are wronged so many people including myself. Will report back when completed.

				tried JMB for a mp to btc conversion. the transaction was processed in a timely manner and at the stated rate. i was very happy with my transaction, its had to find legit traders these days but JMB seems trustworthy and i will do business with him again. i watched JMB since they got on SR and did my research and decided it was all good to try and im glad i did.

				I&#039;m not always the fastest to respond back on feedback but JumboMonkeyBiscuit came through fast as hell for me. I sent him my info for a 200 dollar reloadit card late on a Saturday night. He messaged me after I went to&nbsp; bed and by 9AM the next day I had my bit coins. It was a do or die transaction for me as i am about out of cash until next pay day so i was super pleased to say the least. I immediately placed an order with Subsrgood Sunday night for Subutex with overnight shipping. That went out Monday as promised and arrived tuesday (today) like 30 minutes before i had to go to work so i avoided having a terrible night thanks to both of these amazing vendors. Talk about the stars being aligned. It&#039;s not just luck really as i research the shit out of people on here before making a transaction. If i need a product and am out of good options i only make small purchases. It&#039;s all about the time you put into vetting vendors on here. JumboMonkeyBiscuit is straight up legit though. I&#039;ll gladly use him again.
