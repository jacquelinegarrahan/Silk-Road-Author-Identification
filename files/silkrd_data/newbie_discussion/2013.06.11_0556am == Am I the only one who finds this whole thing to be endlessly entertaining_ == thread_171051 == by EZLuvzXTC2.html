				Since I&#039;ve recently discovered the SR, I have spent massive amounts of time just browsing the listings and the forums. I&#039;ve made a few small recreational purchases but for the most part, the time I&#039;ve spent on here is just like most of my other web browsing, killing time for entertainment value. I&#039;m not entirely certain why this is so fascinating to me, but I definitely find this whole little out-in-the-open underground economy to be a modern marvel of ingenuity, and I just can&#039;t get over how fucking cool it is.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious if there are others out there whose participation and observation in and of the marketplace far outweighs the practical benefits that they&#039;re seeking. Give a shout out if any of this makes sense to you, please. Thanks!

				I&#039;ve been in the underground drug markets online for over a decade and I do find this to be very fascinating.&nbsp; It&#039;s so much different than it was years ago when everything was hidden well and you had to be vouched for and referred to get into a good online drug market.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a lot easier to sell my drugs with such an easy interface and feedback system as opposed to though email on a forum with no real feedback system that requires someone to make a purchase and you get a lot more business exposure which is great.&nbsp; The whole idea was great and I love it!&nbsp; I wish that some useful features would be implemented though.&nbsp; Like sort by price, not being able to change feedback rating and other minor things.&nbsp; Scammers suck dick cheese through a curly straw! &gt;:(

				I honestly was talking with some growers about starting a web based network when one of them turned me onto this site and bitcoin. The dilemma was always the money trail and bitcoin answered that problem fairly well. I still haven&#039;t pulled the trigger and jumped in as a vendor because,<br />1. I still can move product without having to resort to the road. Although it is becoming more difficult and prices are continuing to fall so we will see. I just don&#039;t know if I want to be packaging a bunch of small orders and I wouldn&#039;t send bulk without getting fe&#039;d and I believe that the escrow gives the parties some comfort. I&#039;m just not going to get burned.<br />2. the whole bitcoin deal is a pain in the ass. Getting it to pay for the vendor spot, converting it back to cash to pay bills. I think that part is where you lose some anonymity.<br />The Road is a brilliant move by the dread pirate. He/She or they are sailing this ship full of booty to the promise land. Good on them and I hope it never goes down.<br />It can be entertaining and very educational.<br />GP<br /><br />

				What you say makes total sense. I do like to partake of the goodies but, yep, this is a very cool thing here so simply keeping track of it over time is of itself endlessly interesting. Also, being an end user of the technologies which make it all possible is fun of itself. Tor, PGP and bitcoins have to be major pointers in the right direction for the internet as a whole?

About a week ago I decided to learn more about SR after having heard someone mention it a year or so ago on a clearnet site. My jaw dropped right the floor and my eyes went glassy when the main page came up. I immediately browsed the weed section, since I&#039;d not had any bud in about 15 years. Then I spent many hours trying to find the fastest way to get some BTC, browsing all the vendors of &#039;organic&#039; bud, and as soon as I got it into my SR account placed an order. Oh man I can&#039;t wait for it to arrive. I&#039;m excited but somehow nervous I&#039;m going to get in trouble at the same time. I&#039;m sticking with only amounts that are decrim in my state, though of course federally I might get in trouble from what I understand esp if the return address is being watched. Well we&#039;ll see I guess. But it is fun browsing that&#039;s for sure!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dude you&#039;re so fucked

				yeah this site is pretty fucking incredible. When I discovered a year ago I would just browse all the listings for hours and hours. And I still do -- combined with the forum product requests/offers and community in general it&#039;s a constantly evolving marketplace. Receiving illegal drugs without any hassle in the mail blows my mind every time I get a package. This is the future of safer(ish) drug buying. <br />Also, jack n hoff&#039;s comment surprised me. had no idea online markets had been around so long in some form.

				One of my favourite things is seeing how the prices differ from the streets. For example MDMA and weed are way cheaper on the streets, while LSD and some prescriptions are cheaper on SR. I&#039;d like to go to another country and check out what street prices are there, if you got enough data you could totally figure out where drugs come from and how they flow through the world.

				I love the drugs, I love the system. I love the ethos behind the system. I love the fact that DPR has created a &quot;shop&quot; that works without the laws of the world, without most major currencies of the world, without the taxes. Without everything really. It&#039;s a step forward and a massive landmark for crypo-whatever and agorist anarchic capitalism libertarianism - whatever you want to label it.<br /><br />Plus the forums are informative, fun and downright hilarious at times.<br /><br />OP, I think you are in good company mate

				Yeah this is probably the best forum I have found. The people here seem to be cool . When I first came to the site I didn&#039;t reckon on what I would see. I quickly got to the opiates section and saw some nice #4 rocks. My stomach turned and I had to have them there and then. But I will wait patiently. I hope they get into this smack starved country I am in.<br />The forum is a great place to read and learn about who is who and what is what. <br />In short I am fascinated by the place and can only wish all well in their endeavors here.

I have to live for both of us. I&#039;ve been doing that for 2 years by shooting up my Rx medication (she never got to try Oxymorphone... and Dilaudid was her favorite opioid). She claimed that after the initial Suboxone IV use I got her and myself hooked with, and a little of the Heroin use we reverted to when our Sub guy went to rehab... she didn&#039;t get anything but well from our Opiate/Opioid habit unless it was Dilaudid, Hydromorphone. She was hooked to IV Subutex bad, up until a few months before she committed suicide... We both went to rehab. I relapsed after getting kicked out of detox 18 hours early; and then asked to leave rehab 1/3 of the way left when I admitted to being a male purging-anorexic to the nutritionist. I am &quot;beyond help&quot;.... I&#039;ve basically had rehabs tell me that I have such bad emotional damage/trauma (before my queen killed herself) that it&#039;s basically no wonder I do drugs. I was also self-medicating for physical pain that I didn&#039;t think I was old enough to have. I&#039;m supposed to be on disability... but, drugs let me work, so I work., We would be so happy splitting my Oxymorphone IR script right now. It is what it is though....<br /><br />June 15th was 2 years... I&#039;ve been a social pariah, numbed out on my Rx&#039;s and street-drugs for a while... Then, just my Rx&#039;s in the recent months. Did 100mg of BTH two weeks ago... didn&#039;t feel a thing. OxyM is better than the H around here. I&#039;ve been subject to emotional abuse from my male&amp;female best-friends (who went on about my fiance being abusive); until they iced me out of their lives. I live at home, my parents hate me, I have no self-esteem, and suicide by gun had been sounding more reasonable every day (I literally cannot OD... I engineer attempts and don&#039;t even fall out). But, that has changed recently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve recently found a job (back at the restaurant chain my first bartending job was at... just a different location and I had to get un-blacklisted) I am appreciated at; and have a female friend I made at work that I can laugh with and she doesn&#039;t expect me to get her high or seduce her (I&#039;m the rare male who uses sex for power)... She knows I shoot up (I do in front of her), but she knows I have a &quot;exit strategy&quot; and will be chilling with me during my last nite of daily indulgence with the needle to make sure I don&#039;t OD. How cool is that? I don&#039;t consider phenatylamines, tryptamines, and arylcyclohexylamines to be &quot;Narcotics&quot; like my Rx pills, H, Meth, and Coke are. They&#039;re tools for exploring realities/dimensions/and bonding with other people. My new friend is down to try stuff (said if I offered her H, she likely would do it.... but understands I can&#039;t live with creating an addict out of another young lady); and I&#039;m stoked to remember that a needle isn&#039;t required for a chemical to be worth doing. So, I am excited to change my life and start living again.<br /><br />I have a book coming out soon about my ex and me and the drugs.... How safe is revealing the title, do y&#039;all think?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				I&#039;ve only been around for a few weeks, but I&#039;ve spent quite a bit of time on SR and the forums.&nbsp; The first few times the SR main page loaded were awe inspiring, and had me laughing like a school girl.&nbsp; I&#039;m so grateful that a place like this actually exists, and I hope it sticks around for years to come.&nbsp; I just wish I knew about this community earlier, I would have saved myself quite a bit of time and cash.<br /><br />I can easily lose track of time browsing the listings on SR, there&#039;s more psychedelics than you can shake your stick at XD

				I totally know what you mean. I keep thinking of ideas and ways to improve the Hidden Web. I think the reason it&#039;s so exciting to me is that human beings have never had a medium of communication/organization like this - anonymous, yet publicly accessible.<br /><br />As the the Hidden economy grows, The Man&#039;s control over individuals is weakened.
