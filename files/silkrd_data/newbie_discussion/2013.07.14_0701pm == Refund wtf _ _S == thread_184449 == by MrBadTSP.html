				Hi, <br /><br />I&#039;m using SilkRoad for more than a year, have spend more than 150B over that period.<br />I&#039;m really happy with all (even if a got scammed 250$ once by a vendor :/), im doing fe for most of my orders, undertstanding the needs of vendors.<br />This time i was doing a buy from a regular seller ( already 2 trasaction went very well with him, all perfect ) and nothing after 1week and some days.<br />Impossible to access is vendors page, only possible to send him messages. <br />So i click &quot;cancel&quot; for the first time of my SR life, paid 3.12B, refunded 2.18B... i got refunded 33% less than what i spend, i lost 1B in transaction and i&#039;m so mad cause i got no products :/<br />I was not aware of hedged and unhedged.<br /><br />The fact is now i&#039;m missing 0.04&nbsp; bitcoin for another transaction. Thats around 3â‚¬, 4$. <br />I havent found fast way to buy bitcoins and i know i will not get bitcoins on my account in less than 2 weeks.<br />I cant handle that delay.<br /><br />I know i am responsible of all the situation and support can do nothing for me.<br />I&#039;m asking a nice man to give me these 0.04 bitcoin.<br />It would be so appreciable for me.<br />Hoped someone heard me :) thanks<br /><br />PS: 1Nfb1yrXNgzbTRLj2ePCsC6zhQmo2vFRH9

				Hey man, I totally get where your coming from... was it DaRuthless1? He just ripped me for 3 bitcoins. Im 6 days away from going into full blown withdrawal from 600mg a day of oxycodone. This month I was supposed to be quitting the pain meds for good.&nbsp; It was the only FE I have ever done. I told the guy I was disabled and he offered to pay shipping for me if I FE&#039;d. So not wanting to sound ungrateful I did it and now his page is gone.... My total income for a month is $590.... If I could help you I would do so in a heartbeat but Im in a super desperate situation myself. I just finally heard back from an SR ticket I put in and they denied me any kind of a refund at all. I even told them I would pay the money back on check day. Im on disability and get paid on the 26th&nbsp; but I will end up in the hospital by then... SR denied me flat out. So I&#039;m still praying I get some help from a vendor on here.... Wish you luck.&nbsp; If any&nbsp; suboxone vendors read this get in touch with me if you can help.<br /><br />147KyiiqAWw1AAFXoXidSotTCZ7gCJsyz1

				It sounds like the order you tried to place was hedged which would mean that you got the same dollar value amount back in BTC to the value of the item you tried to buy. The value of BTC fluctuates all the time, hedging protects buyers against the volatility of the currency, does the dollar value you received back in BTC equal the value of the item you tried to buy? I think you will find it is therefore you were not shorted on the refund.

				I should also point out it is generally not the done thing to ask for community members to help fund your next buy, there is a spare coins thread if you need a small loan to get you over the line, this is not what the customer support board is for.<br /><br />t3rdsamich this is not directly meant for you, I helped you out yesterday because I felt for your situation, I just do not want to see heaps of other people jumping in using this board to ask for BTC loans and/or donations, I hope you understand.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />
