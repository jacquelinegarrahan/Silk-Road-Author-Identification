				I&#039;d like to preface this review by stating that I have yet to smoke cannabis from SR that is better than what I get in my town (I have tried some of the classic cannabis vendors here as well; and I am not saying their herb isn&#039;t good, just not what I am used to)........<br /><br />So I got in on the free sample from the new vendor TOPSHELF420.....great decision on my part:)<br /><br />The communication with the vendor is what one would expect; friendly, quick response time and knowledgeable. It&#039;s usually a great first sign always eases any hesitations one may have. So 5/5 for that.<br /><br />The shipping was fine as well. It took exactly a week from when marked &#039;in-transit&quot; to being dropped on the east coast. I am personally used to 2-3 days delivery time, I would suggest using priority mail, only a few dollars more than first class but definitely worth it...or maybe just have it as an option? I say 4/5.<br /><br />Stealth was good but the packaging could be better......a couple of my nugs may have been flattened by the method used (could have just been the usps piling shit on top..)....I think a loose vacuum seal (in addition to the mbb) would have prevented that and additionally offered more stealth. 4/5<br /><br />The product is definitely proper cannabis. I have never had the pleasure of smoking white fire larry og (white fire og X larry og?), and my first reaction is god damn, quality genetics for sure.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag a strong, potent, fresh, pungent scent hit my face instantly creating a grin from ear to ear.....oh yeah it&#039;s a fat gram for sure. I am starting to think that I may have some quality nugget on my hands. I take out the og and at first glance it is indeed some very pretty cannabis.<br /><br />It smells at first kinda fruity to me, then citrus (larry og?)...like grapefruit possibly with a touch of lemon...even some ginger notes present, then the og spiciness kicks in when you crack the little nugget....very nice.<br /><br />It definitely has some nice bag appeal (if that matters to some).....a solid green color that is pretty much masked by the trichomes covering it and pure red pistils dispersed nicely. Again, it is completely covered in trichomes, you can tell the white is present in this strain, very nice. The trichome/calyx structure is well developed and pleasing to look at, especially when the nugs are pulled apart, revealing deeply layered and dripping trichomes throughout.<br /><br />The taste is nice as well. I think this could have been flushed more though.....I am getting a black ash with slight gray specs. I don&#039;t think it is affecting the flavor all that much, but it is nice to see a pure white/gray ash when done puffing. The high is definitely intense and heavy in the eye and face. Not necessarily a face melt, but more a extremely relaxing and euphoric high that is very pleasant and good for anxiety and other issues like that, insomnia. Overall this herb produces a beautiful high.<br /><br />That said, I think this is the best herb I have smoked off sr. There are probably only 2 other vendors I have tried that I would even consider being as good as this og from TOPSHELF420.....so thank you:) A slight improvement here or there, and well you guys will be flying very high. Great experience overall, the herb is indeed worth ordering and I hope to have a zip of it soon.<br /><br /><br />turtle11
