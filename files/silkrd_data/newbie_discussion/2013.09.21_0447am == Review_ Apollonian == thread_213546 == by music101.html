				Hey all. So I need to get my post count up, so I thought I would share a review on here.<br /><br />I ordered up some of his Blue Superman pills. I set up the order on a Friday night, but he was clear in his profile that he was not shipping that weekend. It was my first purchase and went great. The seller upgraded the shipping for me so I got it midweek, and the letter looked like any normal mail.<br /><br />The product itself was amazing. I hadn&#039;t rolled since my early 20&#039;s, about 10 years ago. I don&#039;t remember it being anything like this. I am a bigger guy and the 220 pill was a perfect dose for me. After about 15 minutes, my legs were beginning to tingle, 45 minutes the room started looking darker cause my pupils were getting wide, and peaked hard after about an hour 15. It was a great roll, and I am looking forward to the next time in a few weeks or a month.<br /><br />I would buy from Apollonian again in a heartbeat, and if you are looking for a good roll, check out the product.
