				and I thought I was tripping. IÂ´ve been using the forums for a couple of month now. I like to read more than post sensless shiite so now I am stuck in the newbie forum after trying to post a review to a vendor which i promised to do. Is there anyway around this?

				A key to success is honestly lurking in the forums. I can&#039;t tell you how many times that I have heard a veteran member here say that they lurked for around a year before making even their first small purchase. Caution is king.

				I&#039;ve been using the forums for a while too, and now I found myself unable to post and I couldn&#039;t realise what was going on... until I figured.<br />There could have been a rule about older member with a lowish post count. Lurking is good when you&#039;re a newbie, but when you&#039;re entitled to post, you should be able to in my opinion.<br />Well whatever, I guess DPR has his reasons. And even if he doesn&#039;t, that&#039;s the way it is. The only thing that stinks is not being able to review a vendor as I promised I would (a good review by the way).<br /><br />I refuse to post meaningless comments to reach 50.

				I also am quite reluctant to post utter meaningless shit, but on the other hand i want to get out of this useless part of the forum full of misguided information and useless posts.<br /><br />People really need to look around and find some decent topics on security before they start buying things from SR.
