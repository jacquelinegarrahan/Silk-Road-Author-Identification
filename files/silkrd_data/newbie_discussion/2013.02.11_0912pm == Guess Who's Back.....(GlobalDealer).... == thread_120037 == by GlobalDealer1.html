				GD for starters, don&#039;t give us the old |my pc froze crap, it wont wash, you have money buy a decent laptop. You can&#039;t expect to pick up where you left off. You have tried to set up with another name, not happening so now you try again with your previous name scammer name. good luck. Just tell the truth why you left, and you will get more respect. Don&#039;t mug people of. You have one chance and 1 only, you have been made you scammer.

				GlobalDealer is a scammer, I wouldn&#039;t recommend doing any business with him.

				I was a little bit wary after reading some of the comments in this thread, but I had a positive experience with him. Order took a little longer to arrive than expected (5 or 6 working days in the same country), but it had the best stealth I have ever witnessed on SR and the product (MDMA) is excellent.

				I received a .2 sample of mdma and a mitsubishi pill from GlobalDealer. Packaging was really well done and a good bit of effort put into it.<br />Haven&#039;t tried either of them yet but I plan to try one this weekend.
