				Hello,<br />So I tried methylone for the first time today and oh my god, was it great.<br />It&#039;s like a less pushy, more comfy MDMA, which is exactly what I wanted.<br />However, the stuff is moreish as fuck, and I would like some input from you guys for how to not kill myself with it. I took 130mg +3 40-60 mg boosters, since i thought keeping it under 300mg in a night was pretty safe, but I&#039;d like to hear from you guys if I do it again<br />1)What do you think the maximum safe dose, in terms of initial dose and dose over the course of the night<br />2)How often have you been able to use it without it losing it&#039;s &quot;magic&quot;<br />3)Should I brace for any sort of hangover?<br />thanks in advance for the responses guys, I appreciate it

				It&#039;s easy to quickly gauge the dose for a substance that actively passes mucous membranes via insufflation. I don&#039;t recommend doing it for this substance other than the initial test dose.<br /><br />I find it to be a great, functional stim as well (2-dpmp, still my favourite functional stim - thats not abusable). I&#039;m not the type to want more cuz i just take a benzo and i come down softly.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot like an MDMA and amphetmine combo, with far less serotonin receptor affinity.<br /><br />For focus would take: 120mg orally every 4-6 hours with low benzo dosing between doses.<br /><br />Recreation is more subjective and I need 200 to feel great, but i know some who need 250-300 (more of the fiend types). <br /><br />Alternatively you can climb your does throughout the day: 50-100mg whenever you feel u need more and feel it&#039;s safe to take some that son after (check the halflife).

				I took 180mg as an inexperienced user. Only 2-3 MDMA experiences. Bombed 180mg. First it felt like a drank a coffee and after 40-60 Minutes there was &quot;Boum&quot; in my head and from then on, things were different :) 180mg was enough for funny facial expressions and empathy couldn&#039;t be much higher.&nbsp; Since Methylone is over after ca 3h, i would recharge like half of the dose after 2h. That&#039;s what my friends did and they were cool with it.

				I had lots of M1 experiences when the stuff was legal. 250mg is perfect for initial and boosters. Using small boosters is useless like it is with MDMA. After 1g of that stuff it&#039;s hard to stay focused but I definitely took more in some nights(I&#039;m pretty sure I did more than 2g at least once). But I don&#039;t drink more than 1-2 beer if I go party and drink my 300-500 ml water per hour and eat fruits. Never had any probs with M1 but if you dose that high you may get in trouble if you don&#039;t take care of your circulation.<br />Coming down can be hard/fast if you keep redosing right after the peak and stop suddenly^^

				It&#039;s effectiveness when redosed is somewhere between MDMA and dex-amph/meth-amph. Not as unpronounced as MDMA, but not as rebounding in effect like d- or m-amph. It would be my assumption that serotonin adjustments in the body are adapted to much quicker than dopamine, and the higher a substance&#039;s affinity is to serotonin recetors, in contrast to dopamine, the less useful it is when redosed. The same can be said for addiction and habituation potential - dopamergics tend to rate highest for abuse potential, with short halflife drugs like cocaine causing an immediate strong craving for more, and amphetamines producing a less pronounced craving due to the slower comedown of effects. Less peripheral amphs like dex-amph and meth-amph can be taken in large doses before discomfort occurs, which leads to greater abuse potential and when the ROA is IV or vaporized, psychosis is common after cumulative, frequent dosing.

I&#039;ve done it and you&#039;re not gonna get a great rush, its nasty as fuck, and I&#039;d rather have potentially neurotoxic RCs pass through my digestive system than straight to the dome. I have been able to do it several days in a row with very little tolerance buildup, but I limit myself to maximum 250 within 24 hrs. I feel pretty strongly that much more than that is long term hazardous. You people who do a gram or more at a time are gonna fucking cook your noodles, you know that, right? Nothing like destroying your dopamine receptors at a young age.

				My adice to insufflate an initial 50mg is to aassess the compound for it&#039;s subjective effects it has on you, and test for pssible allergic or enzyme deficient predispositions. It&#039;s harm reduction, it might hurt a bit, but going to the ER panicky and stimmed is one of the worst experiences a mind can experience. <br /><br />The people who do 1g at once are usually impulsive and don&#039;t care about consequences when at the height of their excitement. They usually know its dumb, but they fail to think logically when in certain states of mind - to the detriment of their health. These people should avoid recreational drug use altogether.

				until now the collected data shows that methylone is probably safer than mdma (bu not as tested yet).Pro: levels of monoamine transporters return normal within 24 hrs (where mdma is around 3-4 days). body Temp never goes above 39°C (102,2° F). Zero deaths with methylone solo consume. Con: Higher vasoconstriction(THC reduces vasoconstriction), probably stronger metabolised than MDMA(needs to be investgated).<br />afaik there is nothing like destroying receptors. They&#039;re being deconstructed and rebuild all the time in the synaptic rift. Stuff can be neurotoxic and kill cells or your brain adapts to way to high levels. Anyways our brain is adaptive...

				Listen, to each is own buuuuut...the methylone &#039;peak&#039; is already short, and snorting it makes it even shorter. Effectively, the best administration route is actually plugging but I dont think most folks would like to be this in tuned with their assholes. The next best is orally (and what you eat, when you eat it DOES MATTER). Fairly empty stomachs, roughly 6+ hrs after the LAST meal, cause stronger/longer rolls. Contrary to popular belief, redosing CAN be effective but timing is key here. If you plan on redosing whenever you feel yourself &#039;coming down&#039; IT&#039;S ALREADY TOO LATE!&nbsp; An hour after the initial dose would be better. Of course most folks (if taking it orally) aren&#039;t on the comedown yet an hour after your initial dose, but anything after this hour is going to contribute to the stimulation. Keep a benzo on hand to help with sleep and get some up on L-Tyrosine, 5 htp, and melatonin if you&#039;re going to be taking it often. <br /><br />P.S. Ignore the voice this drug causes lol.<br /><br />-Judge<br />

I&#039;ve known plenty of people who were straight burned out way before their time, because of prolonged and reckless use of stimulants. Like had serious neurological problems, severe depression, just emotional lifelessness. Also, pure and properly manufactured methylone and maybe MDMA might not be neurotoxic in their own right, but I know I certainly have no way of knowing the actual quality or amount of adulteration of the RCs I do. Therefore, I try to be very careful.
