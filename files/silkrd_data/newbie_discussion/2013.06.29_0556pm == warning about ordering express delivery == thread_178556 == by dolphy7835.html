				Expected package to arrive today. Doorbell rang while reading on forums about controlled deliveries. Peaked out window and it wasa mail lady standing on doorstep with package in hand. Didn&#039;t even bother answering. Hoping shed just drop off package at doorstep, but i went upstairs and watched out the window as she walked away with package in hand and dropped a pink slip in mailbox. When i saw her drive to neighbors mailbox to drop mail, then the next mailbox to do the same i said fuck it and said fuck it and chased her down telling her i couldn&#039;t get to door in time. Was waiting for her to ask me to sign for it which i would have refused to do. She just scanned it and handed it to me, so i knew it was all good and there was nothing to worry about by this point. Looked on lable of package and it clearly said no signature required. Got to thinking about it and looked it up on google and it said that apparently it&#039;s up to person delivering the mail to go to the door to make sure express package gets delivered. Also, the usual mail carrier is a man and this was a woman. Wow, i didn&#039;t need coffee this morning as i am still wired up from the experience. If i ever order express again i think i&#039;ll just leave a note on door saying it&#039;s okay to leave packages if there&#039;s no answer. Any other suggestions. Am i still possibly set up by le because i accepted package even though i didn&#039;t sign!

				The mailman does that where I live with Express sometimes. The worst part is we have a mail contractor, not a ups employee. So they come to the door in street clothes. I&#039;ve made it a point to get to know them all by name and I know exactly what they drive. I even get the same UPS lady every time I order a package. It&#039;s nice knowing who is supposed to be at your door, so if some random shows up I am not signing for shit.
