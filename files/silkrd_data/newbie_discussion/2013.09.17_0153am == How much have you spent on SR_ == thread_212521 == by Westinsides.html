				even if he&#039;s a cop, knowing what we&#039;ve spent isn&#039;t going to help him bust anyone<br /><br />forgot the password to my old account, which netted me some $1500+ in primo heroin<br /><br />only about 200ish spent so far on my new account<br /><br />i don&#039;t even bother with street dealers anymore, especially since my DOC is smack, they&#039;re all fucking junkies that just want your money and they&#039;ll rip you off every chance they get<br /><br />SR vendors in my experience actually care about you rexperience as a customer, and even if it&#039;s just to keep people coming back and giving good reviews, i don&#039;t care. the motivation doesn&#039;t matter, so long as the service is good

				<br />&nbsp;I have been here a while, 10 plus Btc is not much. I buy s few times a month and got to over 10 Btc quickly as they were less than 10 UK pounds when I first got some. So I spent a good few coins on my first order. I only buy personal, but probably too much.<br />Plenty of people here spend 100&#039;s of Btc regularly.<br />C

				I&#039;m posting from a new username - for some dumb reason I have been posting with my SR username.<br />I think that may be a big mistake especially if you are doing a lot of business and talking about it on the forum since if you were caught - and your username was found - even if your account couldn&#039;t be accessed - the forum may provide some side/harmful info.<br /><br />Over 75 bitcoin but I don&#039;t think my amount of $10,000+ USD is accurate. That&#039;s a number based on today&#039;s rates right?<br /><br />
