				Hi, I&#039;m currently waiting an order from the Netherlands to Canada for MDMA powder. It&#039;s about 7 days in so I checked my mail today for something that might be from him. What I found made me pretty suspicious today. A couple normal envelopes were wrapped in a few rubber bands. As i took them off I noticed a piece of a corner of an envelope had been ripped off. It had just a little bit of postage stamp left on it. So I took a look at the stamp to see if there was a way of telling it was from. In very tiny font there was the name Joh enschede. This is a dutch company that makes postage stamps. Now seeing how I don&#039;t often reveive mail from the Netherlands and now when I&#039;m expecting a package like this ..I find a ripped piece of envelope that apparently is from the same country as my vendor. I&#039;m paranoid now.. Any thoughts?

				The letters that were bundled in the rubber bands were just normal mail from Canada. There was just a corner piece of envelope with the partial postage that was stuck in the rubber bands that made me a little suspicious. Nothing else was left of that letter. There probably is a perfectly normal explanation and I&#039;m just paranoid.

				Nosy postman maybe. It doesn&#039;t make sense to leave a piece of the envelope in the mailbox though. Why?

				I think you have every right to be spooked, suspicious and concerned. You&#039;d better be ready to deny all knowledge.<br /><br />Modzi

				Well I&#039;ve used encryption when giving my details to the vendor. While using my Tor/Proxy bundle. I purchased my bitcoins through going to a bank (not my own, paid in cash) &gt; bitcoin seller &gt; sr. I have nothing in the house that&#039;s illegal nor any papers with anything written down to tie me to anything. I believe the only thing left to really do if I&#039;m that concerned is to download eraser and wipe my hard drive. All of this for a little piece of envelope. Fuckin&#039; postal workers.

				That last bit may be unnecessary..just play it cool and see what happens...does your package show up in a few days as expected...or does it take a couple of weeks longer and someone shows up claiming &quot;they have a package for you&quot; or otherwise tries to hand deliver it.&nbsp; If that second bit happens or you otherwise are approached by anyone asking anything suspicious regarding said delivery then...then I would do all that last bit as well as officially burn that address.&nbsp; It may be a fluke and your just paranoid, it could be just some jacked up stamp from some mass mailer crap.&nbsp; I would heighten your awareness but unless you start seeing suspicious cars rolling around all the time or parking, or get hit w/ a CD then your probably alright..just a bad time for some fucked up mail ;)<br />TinyDot

				Yeah I suppose it could be a fluke but it&#039;s a pretty bad coincidence and especially with the potential consequences.. If they decided to get a warrant to search the house/take my computer then I&#039;d much rather have my bases covered rather than be at work and stress about it. <br /><br />Thanks for the responses

				Probable cause must be established before a warrant can be executed.&nbsp; Someone must catch you picking up the package (controlled delivery or video surveillance-both take time to set up) and if it is intercepted and somehow they do get a warrant, not all of that will happen in a few days, the law works quick but they don&#039;t work that quick...of course I am referring to US law so results may vary :-\&nbsp; If wiping your computer makes you feel safe then do it.&nbsp; I personally would wait a few days and see if it shows up.&nbsp; If say 15-20 days go by and no package..then I would clean house and wipe the computer and the like, but again that&#039;s just me.<br />TinyDot
