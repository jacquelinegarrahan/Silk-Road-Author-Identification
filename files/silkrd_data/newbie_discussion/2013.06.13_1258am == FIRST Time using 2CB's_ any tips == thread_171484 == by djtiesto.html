				I did 2C-B for the first time last week from ForeverJung&#039;s liquid 2C-B solution.&nbsp; I took 15 mg and definitely had more than a minutely trippy experience.&nbsp; My SO (who is a foot taller and 100 lbs heavier than I)&nbsp; took 20 mg and couldn&#039;t really see what was in front of him due to the visual effects.&nbsp; Though I have limited experience with the drug, I personally feel it&#039;s a fallacy that it is even compared to MDMA.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely a trippy drug and I&#039;m not certain whether a lower dose would really impact this to the point where you would get euphoria sans trip.

				AliceinHolland&#039;s 2C-B pills reagent test as 2C-b/c, so they&#039;re most likely 2C-B, indeed.<br />2C-B isn&#039;t like MDMA at all. Euphoria, but much less loving. Far greater enhancement of sense of smell, and a huge visual component - colors are amazing. Trees, bright signs, etc. Take Shulgin&#039;s advice and have somebody give you a car ride. Unlike MDMA, it doesn&#039;t interfere with sexual ability at all. Definitely some visual distortions and warping.<br /><br />I took 13mg at 200+lb for a first go. Pretty fucking amazing. I&#039;d start with 13mg, regardless. Look at erowid&#039;s dosage guide. Don&#039;t start high, 1/2 or 1 pill and don&#039;t take any more regardless of how long your comeup is. You can always try a higher dose in a week.

				the Beez is the shit!<br /><br />Take one 13mg pill to start, if your not happy with it than drop another. Beware tho, the come up takes like an hour, and is a bitch. Very anxious like L. <br /><br />It wont per say give you the MDMA feel, aside from the sensation of being able to feel the weight of the air on your skin lol. Nor will it give you visuals like LSD.. more like mesc IMO
