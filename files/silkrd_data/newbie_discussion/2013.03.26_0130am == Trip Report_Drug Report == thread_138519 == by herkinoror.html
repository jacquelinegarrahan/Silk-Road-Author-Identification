				I&#039;ve seen some of these in seperate threads so let&#039;s compile them into one thread.&nbsp; Post as many as you&#039;ve got.&nbsp; To 50!!!<br /><br />This is a trip report of my first (and most impressive) trip on DPT (Dipropyltryptamine).<br /><br />Honestly it&#039;s really hard to describe.&nbsp; That first time.&nbsp; We were already on acid and (me and my GF) I had been noodling around with the idea in my head, just wondering when I should do this and we came in from dicking around outside and I just kind of knew/decided that it was time.&nbsp; We got the powder out prepped two lines and snorted it.&nbsp; I believe we only did 100 mgs each.&nbsp; It came on a little slowly i thought.&nbsp; A couple of minutes had gone by and we were only getting vague tryptamine alerts.&nbsp; Little symbols started appearing on everything.&nbsp; Increase in euphoria.&nbsp; Nothing much.&nbsp; So we go back outside.&nbsp; A little more time goes by and as we start to turn to go back inside yet again it begins to hit us really hard.&nbsp; The whole time we were outside I just kept getting more and more uncomfortable.&nbsp; As I was walking inside my vision was strobing.&nbsp; I was robo walking towards the door.&nbsp; It was as though my visual perception became a slide show rather then a movie.&nbsp; One slightly off picture after the next.&nbsp; With small eye blink like periods of blackness in between.&nbsp; Our friends helped escort us to our room.&nbsp; And they left us there in the dark. This was a good thing shit got crazy.&nbsp; About here is where I lose track of the progression of events.&nbsp; All the things I am about to describe happened but for the life of me I could not tell you in exactly what order.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do my best to try and put them in the correct order for you.&nbsp; At that point we sort of started to flow/merge/liquify/crystaliyze/conjoin with each other and objects in the room.&nbsp; These hallucinations where quasi-physical to the best of my recollection.&nbsp; Some times it felt completely real other times it was just extremely confusing and I was to disoriented to notice that my flesh had become like clay and parts of my physical body had merged with the bed we were laying on.&nbsp; A lot of really fucking weird stuff happened that I have difficulty remembering or describing.&nbsp; I think this is probably where I died.&nbsp; Or I almost did.&nbsp; there was a tunneling of vision and I felt like I was dying.&nbsp; There seemed to be paramedics and I could feel how absolutely terrified I was and I knew that my life was fading from me.&nbsp; The came over tried to examine me, got up , and when they thought they where out of ear shot said &quot;There&#039;s nothing we can do for this one.&quot; And started to walk away.&nbsp; At this point me/this other person began to become fully emerged in the death state.&nbsp; It was really happening.&nbsp; I/We/He was/were dying.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what would have happened if my GF hadn&#039;t been there.&nbsp; She had eaten some of her dose and thus was not as far gone as myself.&nbsp; She told me later that it was like I was staring off into that distance with a look of deep panic/pain/disorientation/horror on my face.&nbsp; The lights where on but nobody was home.&nbsp; My eyes where distant and the life/light that was behind them was far away.&nbsp; Yet my face overall facial expression terrified her as I guess it looked like my world was ending, which I guess it kind of was.&nbsp; Now DPT is know for this sort of thing.&nbsp; Users often describe feeling as though they have lived a thousand lives.&nbsp; It definitely has elements similar to that.&nbsp; Eventualy I came back(she may have smapped me out of it IDK)&nbsp; there is this really confusing period in my memory on my way back to consciousness.&nbsp; I stretched out.&nbsp; It was like my body was a stretch armstrong and I had to be pulled through this entire maze of existence whihc was the mirror on my wall on my way back to myself.&nbsp; After an infinity of stretching and being confronted by Marijuana Marketing iconography I find my self being confronted by different versions of my lover trying to pull me out of the abyss.&nbsp; There is a strong impression of the purest lightest blue.&nbsp; Of our soul stuff intertwining and dancing through the emptiness of existence, a future version her/of a potential version of the best possible her/all of the hers possible superimposed over a chess piece (I&#039;m not sure which one.&nbsp; I think either a Queen or a Knight or perhaps both).&nbsp; And just her holding me.&nbsp; Caressing me.&nbsp; Reassuring me.&nbsp; Gently yet with infinite strength.&nbsp; &quot;You are going to be ok.&quot;&nbsp; She says. &quot;It&#039;s all right.&quot;&nbsp; She says.&nbsp; She and this are beautiful beyond description.&nbsp; Somehow the TV had been left on during the early part of this and she had turned it off by this point.&nbsp; Whenever it was on though it had initiated the strangest phase.&nbsp; I was propelled into the television and became the whole news crew and I was reporting the news.&nbsp; Then I got froced back out and I was a projectile being vomited/forced from her to my body through our mouths over and over again.&nbsp; I saw myself through her eyes.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; At some point during one of the crystalizing phases there was what I can only describe as &quot;The Sex/Flesh pit&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s not quite right but it is the best that I can do with language.&nbsp; It was like all the raw energy of sex/sexual frustration was on the cogs of existence and we were being merged with it/on it/near/in it/&nbsp; Neither of us was horny in the least however.&nbsp; We looked at each other (this might have happened later) and asked each other &quot;Was that you?&quot;&nbsp; That was neither of our psyches or visions.&nbsp; In this cog/pit there was a tooth/tusk/protrusion at some point as it turned that was very odd and noteworthy.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say that I remember anything else signifigant.&nbsp; It signifigantly potentiated the Acid at least time wise.&nbsp; We came down and couln&#039;t sleep for like 15 hours but we agreed that at least we were just on Acid now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some other trip reports that agree that whatever drugs you may be on before the DPT goes into you, the DPT totally kicks their ass and takes over.&nbsp; It was one of the most numinous experiences of my life.&nbsp; I would not take it back for anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s what cemented me and my GF as a couple.&nbsp; One of the few cases of shared delusions I&#039;ve been lucky enough to experience.<br /><br /><br />Sorry for it being a block of text.&nbsp; I copied it from somewhere else and the paragraph stuff must&#039;ve gotten messed up.&nbsp; The next one will be handwritten.&nbsp; :)<br />

				This is a direct rip of a post I made in another thread.&nbsp; Sorry but I do wanna get to 50 quite a bit.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a report about Methylone and later Shrooms and Methylone<br /><br />So we decided to go to DragonCon 2010.&nbsp; It is a big Anime,SciFi, Science,&nbsp; Fantasy convention where hundreds of thousans of Nerds, Geeks, and whoever wants to show up flood the ciy of Atlanta,&nbsp; GA for an extended weekend.&nbsp; Think of it as a music festival for fandom enthusiasts.&nbsp; A lot of stuff happened.&nbsp; We did somewhere between 2.5 and 5 grams of our ten gram satchel of methylone during those four days.&nbsp; Being surrounded by thousands of happy cosplaying dorks and intellectuals was a fantastic experience.&nbsp; There was a point where we were in the food court and it is a central hub for the convention which takes place in three different skyscraping hotels (it takes place in four but only 3 are connected.) which are all connected by tubes which lead to this food court in the middle.&nbsp; It was so euphoric and life affirming to feel the energy coming off of these thousands of peaceful souls all their simply to celebrate their common interests.&nbsp; In that food court I could feel the flow of our collective life force as hoards of people flowed past me.<br /><br />Anyways,&nbsp; later one evening there was a special event at at the Atlanta Aquarium.&nbsp; So getting ready for this I take my Shrooms. (This is all I was going to do initially.)&nbsp; We are in this room, waiting for the aquarium to open, watching children build robots and then put them through a competition.&nbsp; I excuse myself to go to the bathroom and eat my oh so weak eight.&nbsp; (they were wild picked.&nbsp; That was good.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want them to be to powerful.)&nbsp; I get back to the room and the shrooms start coming up and right when I start to feel unbearably odd, coming up on powerful hallucinogens while watching other peoples children play, it is over and we can go to the aquarium! <br /><br />First we stop at the car however as my sober friends wanted to get and do their drugs.&nbsp; I&#039;m feelin pretty weird after that kid thing and by the time we get to the parking structure that our car is in I am not really having a good time.&nbsp; I feel pretty shitty and somewhat disasociatted and as my friends are snorting their doses and dissolving the drugs we are going to take with us into our water bottles (as we had been doing the whole time) I was just kind of sitting in the back seat rocking my head back and forth in mild discomfort. <br /><br />My friends being in the drug doing mood wanted me to do some methylone as well.&nbsp; But I was tired of that!&nbsp; After a little bit of coaxing on their part I said fuck it!&nbsp; For science!&nbsp; And I snorted some and took one of the laced bottles.<br /><br />At first there was a mild increase of the disphoria and mental confusion I had been feeling.&nbsp; But when we hit the street the beauty of the sky in all it&#039;s pastel glory, the action of motion, and everything seeing all these weirdos around me started to cheer me up.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We didn&#039;t really know where we were going so we figured we should follow all the people meandering in the same general direction.<br /><br />We ended up meeting some nice victorian women who offered to be our guides and we followed them through the olympics park and onwards toward the aquarium!&nbsp; At this point the visuals from the shrooms where still pretty light (as they where most of the time that evening) but just seeing the clouds float bby behind these giant concrete man made obelisks that where the bulk of the city we were walking through made me smile and start giggling. <br /><br />Finally we got to the aquarium and while they hassled us on a damn juice box (because the straw could be a weapon?) they let us bring in our heavily drug laden water bottles which I found oh so amusing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I had ever been to an auquarium&nbsp; before but it is essentialy a zoo for sea life with the production values of a theme park.&nbsp; We walk in and go to the first exhibit on our right and right as the heavenly chorus of an orchestral choir peaks a gentle wave approaches the glass through the top of the tank and we see fish!&nbsp; Of every shape and size and colour imaginable.&nbsp; At that moment when we entered that first exhibit my heart piqued with joy and awe.&nbsp; I stopped in my tracks as did my girlfriend as children and adults moved past us.&nbsp; We looked at each other and said &quot;wow&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Later we ended up bonding with a mother and her two daughters that had come down from NY just for that one evening.&nbsp; Also I saw a whale shark.<br /><br />All in all it was a pretty light trip and a medium/heavy dose of methylone.&nbsp; But they combine together with the setting in a very special way.&nbsp; The shrooms gave color and majesty to everything and the methylone gave a buzz and a hum to everything (especially any type of living body).&nbsp; The edges were soft and the colors a light pastel.&nbsp; They both conspired to cow me with the awe of a child first discovering the glory of the world and everything in it for the first time.<br /><br /><br />Definitely try it out if you like both drugs seperatley!&nbsp; My only reccomendation would be to do it at some kind of awesome place.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just sit around at home.&nbsp; But to each his own. :)
