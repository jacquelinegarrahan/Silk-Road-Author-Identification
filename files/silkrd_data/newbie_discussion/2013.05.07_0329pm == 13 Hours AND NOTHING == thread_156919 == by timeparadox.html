				I understand your frustration. I have been waiting over 17 hours now.&nbsp; If you read some of the posts fro DPR in the main discussion--he is posting updates on the problem.&nbsp; As for the BTC not showing up--here is a reply from a moderator who answered others having this same problem.&nbsp; We are not alone, friend, and they are working on it.<br /><br />Re: Anybody else not seeing bitcoin deposits?<br />« Reply #7 on: May 06, 2013, 06:22 pm »<br />Hi folks,<br /><br />The deposit process can take up to 24 hours but normally takes a lot less.<br />If you&#039;re checking the deposit on a site such as blockchain.info then what you&#039;re seeing is Silk Road&#039;s tumbler in action. There is nothing to worry about, and you will receive your coins.<br /><br />If you do not receive your Bitcoin within 24 hours of having sent them, you can contact SR Support on the main site using the link in the bottom right hand corner of any page.<br /><br />The GreenXchange, please check your PMs.<br /><br />Libertas<br />

				no problem making another thread<br /><br /><br />i guess the more it&#039;s noted the better... at least until the mods get fed up, hopefully when they do we&#039;ll have some answers and reasonable time frames <br /><br />also @thequarian, they should look at updating their support FAQ page, it states that if waiting over six hours then a support ticket should be raised. I know it&#039;s an issue, but members are going to continue making the same threads with the same posts until something is done whether that be a resolution or some notification about resolving the issue.

Perhaps you might make that suggestion to SR support.

Maybe after they fend of this attack (which sounds like a doozy, BTW, have you read DPR&#039;s updates?) they will update the FAQ page.

				Happy to help, timeparadox, I flipped out the first time it happened to me but it all worked out beautifully in the end. Make sure to read around on the forums--especially what DPR has to say. I feel like I&#039;ve entered a community of soul mates....
