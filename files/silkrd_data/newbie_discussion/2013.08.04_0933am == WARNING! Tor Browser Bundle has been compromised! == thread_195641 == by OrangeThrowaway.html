We&#039;ll have to wait until security researchers get their hands on it to get full confirmation but that could take a while as a lot of them are at Black Hat right now. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the attacker can break out of virtual machines since they managed to compromise Freedom Hosting hard enough to trace its owner, and I don&#039;t have a spare physical machine to run this exploit on. <br /><br />Also, my post is basically the best-case scenario. No-one&#039;s been able to confirm whether it downloads a further payload of code or the contents of that payload so there&#039;s a good chance any machine that&#039;s been on Tormail or Freedom Hosting recently with the TBB is also fully compromised.

				I read the article on reddit about this, and there is a lot of back and forth about whether javascript has the capability to do this. Most were saying you have to have other software running for this to take place (java/silverlight), and in case you are not aware (I&#039;m sure most here are) javascript and java are not the same.<br /><br />Anywho, if this is true that FBI did inject some code to the tor mail site and it somehow does redirect to your actual email address, it really shouldn&#039;t matter that much anyway. Using tor mail alone is not illegal, and if you are discussing shady topics and NOT using PGP, then you are not being cautious enough anyway. From what I gathered reading from the paranoid pedophiles who are obviously uber concerned about this, they are stating this code was injected to some CP sites so they can track down the pedos. I&#039;m not for LE for many things, but I will say whan it comes to children being molested, I hope they round those losers up and either get them the help they need to stop, or remove their junk. I can tell you if that ever happened to any of the children in my life, I would empty every hollow point I have in them.<br /><br />If anyone has more on this, please post away, this is a topic of the utmost importance.<br /><br />CORRECTION: apologies I stated java and javascript are the same which is not true they are not the same. Missed a word.

From what I&#039;ve read so far, they busted the FH owner tracking his bank records or some shit like that, and maybe all the info that Anonymous spewed a couple years ago gave them a place to start. But I (or anyone really at this point) knows much about what happened. Once they get him back in the US and he goes to trial and they release the discovery on the investigation, we will hopefully learn more.<br /><br />And futhermore, we all know they want SR BAAAAAAD and I&#039;m sure if they had a good method of hacking servers through tor, they would have probably taken it down first before the pedos. It seems LE are more spiteful than most and since SR is the biggest slap in their face regarding their failed war on drugs, and even though morally IMO it wouldn&#039;t be right, they would probably go after SR first. But again just my opinion.

Use noscript and forbid scripts globally, edit the settings of the browser and turn off javacript.<br /><br />Silk road is not compromised (for now). It is not the TBB itself compromised but the TBB(firefox) contains a previously unknown exploit which they are hosting on ALL FreedomHosting Websites(Pedo sites, Onion bank, tormail, ect. I have heard that 50% of the darknet was hosted on freedomhosting.)<br /><br />

Not saying the feds won&#039;t hack into the tor mail code and attempt to break into some accounts to try to find some illicit material, but again if you use PGP or didn&#039;t do anything illicit, then you don&#039;t have anything to worry about from my limited understanding of the law.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m worried about those who had their darknet contextual identities linked to tormail as well as their &quot;real life&quot; identities.<br /><br />Have confidence that the feds are having an absolute fun time with those servers right now, busting people left and right.

				To clarify the situation, using the Tor Browser Bundle is still fine, and a good solution for people who can&#039;t install Tails or similar.<br /><br />HOWEVER if you used TBB or Firefox 17 to try to access tormail recently (and javascript was enabled, which I think is the default), then you probably have FBI malware on your computer. In that case the only thing to do is wipe your computer, reinstall the operating system, and then change your SR passwords.<br /><br />Nobody has yet figured out what the FBI malware does, but it&#039;s reasonable to assume they now have complete control over your computer, and can see anything on it they want.

If javascript is enabled, and you accessed the site when it was malware laden, then I&#039;m afraid you have to consider the computer &#039;burned&#039;, yes, and reinstall the OS. Or buy a cheap laptop and only use that for SR, and continue to use your current computer for &#039;innocent&#039; stuff.

				The tor project have now put out an official statement, and the exploit code has now been analysed. And there&#039;s good news: the exploit code only went as far as sending your real MAC address and IP address to someone (presumably FBI), so no keylogger or other stuff was involved. So no wiping of the OS needed. The tor project also confirmed that releases since June 26th weren&#039;t affected, and if the browser was auto-updated since then you&#039;ll be fine.<br />https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html<br />http://tsyrklevich.net/tbb_payload.txt

				&gt;To be clear, while the Firefox vulnerability is cross-platform, the<br />&gt;attack code is Windows-specific. It appears that TBB users on Linux<br />&gt;and OS X, as well as users of LiveCD systems like Tails, were not<br />&gt;exploited by this attack.<br /><br />whew! I was scared for a second.

Just like the NSA says &quot;oh we can send info to LE, but we never do, we only want terrorists really&quot; and then today it comes out how they in fact have been supplying LE with leads for some time and then LE grooming the case to make it look like it was just a normal investigation. <br /><br />Oh and of course the war on terror, what a joke, they need to call it what it really is, a war on our privacy and rights.

				I&#039;m relieved that I&#039;m not the only one who sees that. The government lies to people, it indoctrinates children, it threatens everyone by force to extract resources and obedience. Then pity &amp; empathy is used to manipulate you and destroy any rational objection you have. I mean really, who can object to the &quot;war on child pornographers&quot; ?<br /><br />The only people who really can are rational thinking human beings who see through the thick veil government abstract language and bullshit.

				Well I would disable javascript on your browser period, but I think the only people who seemed to have been affected were windows users who had javascript enabled and were using Tormail before June 26. After June 26 TOR came out with a patch that addressed the exploit...This is based on what I&#039;ve read so far so someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

If you updated your version of TBB when it asked you to or you didn&#039;t start using until after June 26 you are ok. This exploit didn&#039;t start until around July 30th or so (no one knows for sure the exact day but it couldn&#039;t have been much earlier than this since the owner was just arrested and one would HOPE that he would have known his servers were exploited) so you would have to have been using an outdated version of TBB and visited an exploited site in the last week or so to be compromised.<br /><br />I&#039;m basing this off of a thread posted the by the tor developers, so hopefully they are being honest, and if they are not, we have a lot more to worry about than this exploit.<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING<br />https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html

				I kinda feel like an idiot for not knowing the importance of disabling javascript, or enabling noscript and locking it down.&nbsp; I kinda figured the default settings of the TBB were optimal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been shopping on this website for probably 5 or 6 months.&nbsp; Researched tor, SR, the forums, etc for a few months before purchasing.&nbsp; And never did I realize that these security steps should be taken.&nbsp; Luckily, I keep my browser up to date, and haven&#039;t visited tormail in a while.&nbsp; And didn&#039;t use it for much anyway.&nbsp; I guess this is a wake up call.&nbsp; At least some good has come of it.&nbsp; I and many others like me, now have a better understanding of security. Sucks the whole noscript/javascript thing wasn&#039;t pushed a little more... maybe the full ramifications just weren&#039;t realized since this is the first widespread attack like this.<br /><br />I think as a non dealer, small time user, most of us can relax.&nbsp; We all know if they go after anyone, it will be those supplying things.&nbsp; I know for the most part, the suppliers are even stricter about security.... so hopefully they stay protected and up their protection as well.

				One of the unknown issues is the content of emails on the tormail server account at FH.<br /><br />This info is on the tormail site (tormail.org, not their onion site).<br /><br />&quot;Tor Mail consists of several servers, a Tor hidden service, and an incoming and outgoing internet facing mail servers.<br />These internet facing mail servers are relays, they relay mail in and out of the Tor network, the relays are purchased anonymously and not tracable to us.<br />The only thing stored on the hard drive of those servers is the Exim mail server, and the Tor software.<br />No emails or logs or anything important are stored on those servers, thus it doesn&#039;t matter if they are seized or shut down.<br />We are prepared to quickly replace any relay that is taken offline for any reason.&quot;<br /><br />This describes / addresses the traffic to and from the server but doesn&#039;t address the actual server that is hosting tormail.<br /><br />So there are a few questions (well lots actually) regarding tormail itself.<br /><br />1. Are the emails in the inbox, sent and any other folder you may have created, readable?<br /><br />2. Is / was the content on the tormail server encrypted?<br /><br />3. Are deleted emails recoverable?<br /><br />4. If both sides of the email conversation had deleted their emails (in both sent and inbox) are these emails still on the server and are they recoverable?<br /><br />5. Did tormail keep logs on their main server? if yes or no, did FH enable log files on the whole servers activities?<br /><br />6. If deleted emails were scheduled to be deleted off the server, what time frame was involved?&nbsp; e.g. was it immediately, every 7 days, every 30 days&nbsp; or the owner simply said I don&#039;t give a fuck, not my problem (I doubt it).<br /><br />Maybe a good indication of this timing might be to ask an admin of SR, if messages here are deleted from original sender and receiver after what time period would they be permanently deleted from the server? <br /><br />I&#039;m sure there&#039;s 100&#039;s if not 1,000&#039;s of people worrying about this, trying to remember the content of their emails, did I? didn&#039;t I encrypt???&nbsp; Fuck I don&#039;t remember.&nbsp; This must be a thought of a lot of people.<br /><br />Maybe the answers to these questions could help people relax or book tickets to visit Snowden&#039;s new home lol.<br /><br />With all the great design and forethought that went into tormail, it appears they didn&#039;t consider what would happen if their server was discovered and physically controlled by LE. There is no (well I couldn&#039;t find) any information on what actual server side protection tormail set up or used.<br /><br />BTC4Cash

				I&#039;ve had a techy friend look into this for us. <br /><br />For those who used squirrelmail on tormail:<br /><br />If you deleted your emails from inbox and sent items then purged your trash folder, then those emails are also deleted from the mail server. Depending on the mail server setup it may or may not keep logs of emails sent and received but this will NOT include the content of the email.<br /><br />Any email that existed in any folder, including the trash folder, you need to assume 100% that the Fed&#039;s can and will read it.<br /><br />As for the ironcube (or what ever its called) I have no information.<br /><br />Here is the info they sent me:<br /><br />Email is received from the internet by a POP (Post Office Protocol) email server.&nbsp; When you launch your email program and click the send and receive email button, your email program asks the POP server to deliver any new email.&nbsp; Your email program then downloads the current messages then tells the POP server to delete the messages on the server since the email program now has a copy of the messages on your PC.&nbsp; You can control the action of your email program by telling it to delete messages after they have been downloaded, or telling the server to keep a copy for a period of time. <br /><br />It&#039;s preferable to have your email program delete messages off of the server, because if you leave too many messages on the server your inbox will get too large and will cause performance problems with your email account.&nbsp; We STRONGLY recommend deleting messages off of the server.&nbsp; Below are instructions for setting your email software to delete messages off of the server after downloading them.<br /><br />Note: Mail does not have to be in your Inbox to clog up your account — mail in your &#039;Sent&#039; folder also takes up space, so make sure to empty both your inbox and sent folders.<br /><br />Once you have deleted mail from the relevant folders, a small link will show up next to the &quot;Trash&quot; link that says ‘Purge’. Click ‘Purge’ to remove all trash messages completely from your server.<br /><br />BTC4Cash
