				I&#039;m getting ready for a big festival coming up soon. Planning on bringing around 30 pills for a bunch of my friends and I. I&#039;ve heard that putting it in an advil bottle works, but I&#039;m unsure if 30 is too much for that plan. Any alternatives? And please don&#039;t say to stick it in my ass. Flight is domestic by the way and thanks for any tips!

				I&#039;ve done it before with an advil bottle. I put the pills in, then put the cotton ball back in and re-sealed the foil part on top so it would look like the bottle was never opened. Opening the foil seal without damaging it so you can put it back isn&#039;t easy though. <br />I brought that in my carry on and didn&#039;t have any problems.<br /><br />Another time when I was being super paranoid I sewed them into the seem of a button down shirt and put it in my checked luggage. <br /><br />Another time I put them in my underwear. Lol I had no problems any time. But this was all before the days of body scanners. <br /><br />Or you could mail them to yourself at the hotel where you&#039;ll be staying if you don&#039;t want to bring them on the plane.

				I USED to send my pills to myself to the hotel I would be stayin g at<br />BUT..it&#039;s been awhile and now I would checkout the &quot;forgeries&quot; section of SR and find the guy that makes fake scritp bottles..you can&#039;t use &#039;em to try and get filled BUT itf scanned it will come back with YOUR info.<br />Might be pricey, but it&#039;s worth it to me to have &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card ;)<br />I AM however, FREE of my horrible painkiller addiction as of 9 days ago..HURRAY FOR ME! ;)<br />hope this helps...<br />~PB2k<br />I&#039;m trying to get to my 50 posts while helping others along the road :)

				What pill you trying to bring. If its ecstasy or something dogs are trained to smell it not a good idea. If it just pain pills or benzo&#039;s then just get the fake pill label you can buy like someone said above. It will not try to get refill with it ,but to carry on plane no one would should blink an eye. If you are bringing anything a dog is trained to smell then are asking for 50/50 chance. If just pharms I would go with the fake label. He gives I think 3 with the purchase so they look new an fresh when your old pill bottle label looks old but its stuffed full of pills.

				What terrible ideas some of you have.<br /><br />What do all seniors carry with them on the plane? Their medication reminder thing with the little boxes marked MTWTFSS. I see them come through with tons of different pills. I don&#039;t carry whole bottles, the senior citizens don&#039;t either.<br /><br />Just get one of those dose reminder things at the pharmacy, no one will question your supplements and medications.<br /><br />Put it in a non-standard bottle&nbsp; or bottle that doesn&#039;t match the pills and you are potentially and you are asking for trouble.<br /><br />I just jumble all my meds into a little bottle and it stays in my backpack. There are some klonopins, clonidine, oxycodone, aspirin, nucynta, and hydrocodone in there. I have scripts for all, so in the end I don&#039;t worry.<br /><br />Just use the old people pill containers and you will be fine.

				If you are flying with friends you could try split the load between you guys?<br /><br />You could ship them to a friends address nearby/ your hotel.<br /><br />You could sew them into clothing such as waistband of some pants <br /><br />You could throw them into a pill bottle.<br /><br />You could hide them under your scrotum if they&#039;re small enough. Just make sure you shave BEFORE if using tape.<br /><br />Or you could always mix them with water, whatever that technique is called and throw that into your checked luggage?

				lol this is funny, one time i was trying to explain to my friend how easy it would be to smuggle maddd sheets of lucy through airport in a college text book or within some books, and he seriously was tryina tell me they would be able to tell through the x-ray machine. I kept tellin him &quot;dude how the fuck is an xray gonna distinguish paper from paper? its impossible lol like they would notice the thickness like 5 extra peices of paper or so would add to a text book&quot; Somehow he didnt believe me... dumb fuck haha. Probably would only smuggle paper through the airport if it were me. And mannn just give ur mom a pill or two for free when it comes then she couldnt possibly be mad at you for anything =D

				I brought 500 oxy 40&#039;s from mexico to the USA in IBProfun bottles with the re-seal technique mentioned above.<br /><br />All these will work, i&#039;ve done this so many fucking times.

				99% no risk is a pipe dream, bro... you&#039;re trying to take 30 pills on an airplane!<br /><br />if there&#039;s no x-ray body scanner, the absolute best way is in your pocket. Just walk right through with them in your pocket. I&#039;ve done that a bunch too.<br /><br />But either the OTC pill bottle in carry on, or shampoo bottle checked is my top pick if you&#039;re dealing with body scanner.<br /><br />Take your shampoo bottle and empty half of it out into a container. Make sure it has a wide opening at the top.<br /><br />Put your pills in a sandwich baggy and roll it up. Triple bag it (or food saver it). <br /><br />Put your rolled up bag in the bottle. Top it off with the reserved shampoo so it&#039;s completely covered. <br /><br />I&#039;ve transported marijuana like this a few times. <br /><br />Get a matching brand new conditioner too. Make sure to put a bunch of random other BRAND NEW toiletries as well and put them all in the same bag. Throw it in your checked luggage. You should be good to go.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also just put them in random pockets in my checked baggage. Or just let a couple loose in your bags.<br /><br />Good luck!

I think you&#039;re far worse off having the x-ray machine show a Baggie rolled up in a shampoo bottle than simply a prescription bottle full of pills. Agree 100% with your other advice about lots of toiletries and OTC medication (if you don&#039;t have Rx bottles). <br /><br />My wife travels with a few hundred pills of about 10 different medications at least a dozen times a year. She has never had her pills checked. I fly about 40 times a year (really) in the US with 20+ Vicodin 10/325&#039;s, a few flexiril, and some Valium randomly mixed together in a starbuck&#039;s mint tin and have never been checked - not once. I&#039;ve also taken 10 E pills in an Advil bottle on about 6 different international flights. Never had a problem. <br /><br />The things to remember are -<br /><br />1. If at all possible, have a prescription bottle in your name and put them in that. The more obscure the medication, the better off you are. <br />2.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a prescription bottle in your name, get some completely unknown over-the-counter medication and replace all the pills with your pills. Problem with Advil is that everyone knows exactly what they&#039;re supposed to look like, so if they do open the foil and it doesn&#039;t look like Advil, you&#039;re screwed. <br />3. If possible, put as many random, small, normal odds and ends in the bag as you can - chargers, flash drives, little toothpaste tubes, etc. so it&#039;s not just your clothes and one bottle of drugs. If you have other medications, all the better. <br />4. Airport security is not looking for &lt;50 pills of anything UNLESS you stand out or pose a potential threat. Dress nicely, act professional, don&#039;t look shifty, and don&#039;t go through security with a bunch of people looking like you&#039;re hitching a ride to Burning Man. I do go to Burning Man, but I don&#039;t wear my playa gear on flights :) When you arrive at your destination, you can wear whatever the hell you want, but don&#039;t make a counterculture statement as you try to bring drugs through airport security. <br />5. Best attitude to take is slightly bored, checking your phone to pass the time, barely noticing you&#039;re going through security at all. If you have a significant other or friend, go together. Larger group, go through with just one person, not a crowd of 3-6 party people. <br />6. Worst-case scenario and they do find them and ask, just tell them they&#039;re the medication listed on the bottle (I hope for your sake they don&#039;t have little smiley-face imprints). If they say they need to confiscate them, say fine - you&#039;ll just get another bottle when you get there. Do not complain or act like it&#039;s any big deal. While possible that they&#039;ll go full Monty and escalate it, most of the security people don&#039;t want to be caught looking like fucking idiots by freaking out over a bottle of Ex-Lax. If the pills aren&#039;t labeled, it&#039;s unlikely they&#039;ll take it further unless they feel confident they&#039;re illegal. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t feel that you can keep your cool under pressure, then the above may not help. Airport security definitely does pay close attention to nervous people - maybe a couple of Valium/Xanax and a beer might help :)<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				How would I carry pills on an airplane? I&#039;d do it like this.<br /><br />Step one: conceal pills in package.<br />Step two: label package with my destination.<br />Step three: mail package.<br />Step four: fly to destination.<br />Step five: retrieve package.<br /><br />That is to say: I WOULDN&#039;T.

				i&#039;ve carried pills with me on multiple occasions (domestic flights).&nbsp; sometimes i put them in a spare prescription bottle.&nbsp; i&#039;ve also kept them with my regular prescriptions in a sandwich bag or pill separator. in both carry-ons and checked luggage.&nbsp; never had a problem.&nbsp; i think it would only raise an alarm if you had a ton of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />not saying it&#039;s a great idea, though..

				Because of the low amount I wouldn&#039;t even bother trying to go through security with them at all, its much less riskier to have some sort of concealment in your checked bag or just tucked away somewhere inconspicuous. Way more bags that are being checked and they won&#039;t be looking for a mere 30 pills especially if cleverly stashed and won&#039;t be as diligently scrutinized then having them on your person or bringing on carryon. Especially with the increase of body scanners (the two major airports near me have installed them). All in all, because its domestic and its just 30 pills, especially if you do spilt up a few with your friends to have a just a couple in there check in bags, you&#039;ll be golden. I&#039;ve brought weed, pills, liquid LSD domestically and internationally( albeit in small quantities just for my personal usage) in my checked bag everytime with no qualms.&nbsp;

				For domestic flights, I&#039;ve always just bought some pick n mix sweets at the local supermarket and thrown my stash in with them and made sure they were all at least halfway down the bag and left them in my hand luggage.<br /><br />For international flights, I buy a couple of big bags of chocolate eclairs. I take one bag and carefully slice along the bar code on the back with a Stanley blade and remove some of the sweets and add my special ingredients before wrapping them back up and placing back inside the bag.<br /><br />I carefully place some clear scotch tape on the back of the opening (so the tape is inside the pack) and seal it back together. You need a steady hand to make it look seamless, so don&#039;t be doing this under the influence of drink or drugs!<br /><br />What you appear to have is 2 bags of sweets that you haven&#039;t even opened. Does the job.

				I always crush everything into fine powder and put it in a small plastic zip bag. Then I simply store the bag into my wallet and carry it in my pocket.<br /><br />When I&#039;m about to cross the metal detector, I put my mobile phone, my wallet (full of drugs), my belt, keys, etc on the white plastic tray as instructed, and that&#039;s all.<br /><br />They have never opened my wallet. Never. I&#039;ve done this quite a few times and they just ignore it.<br /><br />Regards.<br />

				<br />Not worth trying to take them on the plane. Just post them to yourself. Even If you are not staying anywhere you are camping at the festival or whatever it is a far better idea to book a hotel for one night and post them. Also when you post them remember to use MBB Bags (Dog Proof)<br /><br />

				the SMTWTHFS vitamin case works.. especially if you have a random array of pills. I&#039;ve done that!<br />If you have cleavage, thats your best option. Now they have body scanners, but they haven&#039;t been approved so you can &quot;opt-out&quot;, I do it every time no matter what I am or am not flying with. then you have someone oat you down, so girls, cleavage.. Boys, from what I hear there&#039;s some space down there?<br />I&#039;ve also crushed up white powders into BC powder packets...

				You guys over think all of this.<br /><br />Best advice I can give you is to just put it somewhere they&#039;re not going to look. AKA make it so that one would have to look through EVERYTHING to find anything. <br /><br />Making things blend in with supplements is a good idea too.
