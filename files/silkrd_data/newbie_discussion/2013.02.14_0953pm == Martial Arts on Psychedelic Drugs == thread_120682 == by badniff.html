				Ever tried it? It&#039;s one of my favourite trip-activities. <br /><br />On LSD and Mushrooms coordination and balance gets enhanced. Time can slow down - giving you lightning reaction times. Chi flows like a waterfall and your perception gets enhanced to the point where all of your opponents intentions become obvious. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried hand-to-hand and weapons. I learned a lot about using the staff from shrooms; they really enhance the creativity in movement making you more unpredictable.<br /><br />I know other people get lowered physical performance on psychedelics, I have seldom experienced that.<br /><br />PS I have trained martial arts most of my life and only fight with people who enjoy it. Yes we do get hurt sometimes ;)

My experience of shrooms tell me that they are empathogenic, especially in higher dosages. If I act like an asshole on shrooms then I feel real bad afterwards.

				Surfing waves on thc was kinda nice flowy&#039;, but slightly clumsy as well in balance .. the energy drop leading to quicker exhaustion though was feelable. ah, how could i miss out on going surfing after the epic acidtrip with the maya-calendars back in mexico .... <br /><br /><br />for martial arts, the sensibility in your whole perception, the imaginative power and your enhancement as a whole is something that i imagine very very interesting in a brazilian jiu jiutsu battle. <br /><br />just made a semi appointment with a mma fighter this week, time to swing my ass back to the gym i guess ツ

The psychedelic state helps to unite the mind and the body, giving you a great opportunity to explore the limits of your skill. It can of course have an adverse effect, therefore i should stress the importance of knowing your body, your drug, your setting and your dosage.<br /><br />I had a near cliff experience once. I lost all grip on how steep the the rocky hill was, had to compare with pines to approximate how I should adjust my balance. It was actually a bit scary.
