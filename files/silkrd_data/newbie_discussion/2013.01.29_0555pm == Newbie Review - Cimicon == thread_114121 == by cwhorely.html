				Ordered 1/20, from an add that said specifically fast shipping, from the USA (to the USA). I ordered priority mail. It said it shipped on the 24th, as did his vendor page. Mail came today, and still nothing. <br /><br />I messaged him and no response for a day. <br /><br />I only am posting this to try and help others, as I can&#039;t post on his review thread. Maybe he&#039;s just had some bad luck, but communication would be nice. <br /><br />Too good prices always are.<br /><br />I&#039;ll happily report back if anything changes

				Cimicon is having a lot of problems. You might&#039;ve noticed the sharp drop in his rating recently. Rack up your 50 and check out his review thread and join all of us who are in your very predicament.

				Yeah, I saw his review thread, found out the new 50 post rule, and felt I had to do something because he kept the listings up, and I saw all the poor &quot;FE for a well reviewed vendor&quot; people. I hope he just had a glitch and will come through for everyone, but he could also cut and run with the a few grand in FE&#039;s.<br /><br />Since then, more reviews have come in. When I wrote that, I think he was still in the mid 90&#039;s, and the testimonials on his vendor page were persuasive. He has removed the offending listings, and his rating have dropped. <br /><br />My order still sits in limbo, no response from him. Trouble getting on SR has kept me from trying to get him to cancel. Plus it was such a good deal I&#039;m still on his hook. <br /><br />damn, 50 posts is a lot. I don&#039;t like to post unless I have something to say, but I guess I have to get chatty. <br /><br />Good luck to you as well.

				Chatty as fuck. If you or anyone hear anything about cim&#039;s percocet please let me and the rest of the SR community know. As far as I know, nobody has tested them out.

				No delivery, no response. Asked him yesterday to cancel the order if he didn&#039;t have a tracking # for me. Not cancelled. He still seems to be shipping out other stuff, but just trying to ignore this situation.<br />

He doesnt respond to messages at all.&nbsp; never sent tracking #.<br />when he 1st listed, he said he would never ask for FE.&nbsp; few days later he adds to his profile that anyone with less than 15 transactions must FE.&nbsp; and he says all orders have shipped 1/24-&nbsp; but percs have slight delay.<br />nobody has gotten percs from him.&nbsp; he kept listing &amp; selling it until few days ago.&nbsp; Now i see his other stuff has been reported as FAKE. i dont see how hes completed 100 orders or his rating is still about 85.&nbsp; alot of people are complaining.&nbsp; why doesnt SR step in do something now?<br /><br />I contacted SR for resolution.&nbsp; glad i didnt FE.&nbsp; hope i get all my money back.<br /><br />Anyone know how I can leave feedback for him before resolution is finished?&nbsp; let me know. i dont see options anywhere.

				Thanks.<br />I was hoping i could leave bad feedback, because i saw some bad feedback by other buyers stating same problem as me. <br /><br />This guy is a mess.&nbsp; now his profile says he&#039;ll be away for few days.&nbsp; what a dick.<br /><br />I just dont understand why SR doesnt do something now.&nbsp; Can they suspend or freeze his account?&nbsp; Has that ever happened to other shitty vendors?&nbsp; <br />

				I feel your pain PL, but this is the system we have, and it is set up to protect vendors and buyers. If you haven&#039;t FE&#039;d count you lucky stars. After 17 days and 3 unanswered messages, he wrote back today he was sick for the last couple days, which he must have planned beforehand according to his vendor page. It sucks, but he&#039;s tied up my money for the same time as yours. And the funny thing is he is still receiving positive feedback on his other products, as well as continued FE&#039;s.

				Oh, and I forgot to relay his message today. Basically he said, hey, I&#039;ve been out sick for the last couple days, I&#039;ll get back to you later. No update on the order, resolution, etc. <br /><br />Vary helpful.

				He said that a week or two ago. He also said his shipping guy was sick. I&#039;m in resolution. Some people on the official thread have talked about reporting him for selling fake meds (some of which have caused serious issues for people), for advertising and accepting money for product he doesn&#039;t actually have on hand, for excessive delays combined with shoddy communication, etc. It&#039;s a whole fucking situation and something I wish I didn&#039;t have money tied up in. Also I&#039;ve been in resolution for several days and have yet to hear from him.

				Update on my situation-<br />&nbsp;After 7 days of being under resolution- Cimicon finally sends me a message saying he was sick thats why he didnt reply ( for 3 weeks? bullshit. what does he have? cancer?&nbsp; i hope he gets cancer of the prick. lying piece of shit ).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Get this- he then tells me he has shipped my order and its already IN TRANSIT to me &amp; he&#039;ll update me with tracking number soon. no explanation or apology for not sending it on 1/24.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;the next day SR responds telling me cimicon agreed to my resolution to give me a refund???&nbsp; huh?&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m happy to get my money back, but this guy is clearly a compulsive liar.&nbsp; why even tell me the order is in transit?&nbsp; no way hes sending me free shit.<br />&nbsp;this guy is a degenerate scumbag.&nbsp; in the message boards he said he was sick back on 1/17.&nbsp; now he using that excuse again. says everything has shipped, yet nothing has.&nbsp; <br />And of course now that bitcoins have gone up I get back less then I sent.&nbsp; The order wasnt hedged so i was expecting same amount back.&nbsp; But I know SR only promises to get back your USD.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Its frustrating cuz you go thru all the legwork just to get some bitcoins, then u have trouble with an order &amp; when u get a refund, u have less&nbsp; btc to play with.&nbsp; last asshole to do that was SouthStar.&nbsp; He cancelled my order after 24 hrs, for no reason, and the order was hedged, so I lost some btc cuz the price happen to spike that day.&nbsp;
