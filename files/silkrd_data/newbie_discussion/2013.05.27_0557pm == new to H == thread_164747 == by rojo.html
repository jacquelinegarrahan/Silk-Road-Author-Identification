				Hey all, so i was just wondering about different ways of doing H. Do they all make you sick as hell the next day. I have only done H once (not new to opiates by any means though). The time i did was about a 1/4g (intranasal) and i threw up the whole next morning. Is there any way to ingest that makes you less sick?

				do as you wish, I just feel that I should share with you that heroin almost totally ruined my life, killed 5 good friends, and has almost singlehandedly destroyed entire neighborhoods where I live. painkillers aren&#039;t much better, but there&#039;s much less chance of overdose. I don&#039;t know you but I hate to see another person potentially start down a road to complete destruction. Just my 2 cents.

				No matter how you do it, be prepared for some up chuck. Normally it happens while on it though, not after. You don&#039;t normally get Withdrawals after just one use. If given the option though, stay away. I&#039;ve lost many friends as well. My rehab count is up to 13, and I feel lucky to get that many tries. Just BE CAREFUL.

				you can lower your tolerance, by stop using another opiates for a while.<br /><br />and then using just a little of H.<br /><br />(don&#039;t know if will help, just an idea, anyway please stay safe)

				I think it&#039;s subjective, honestly. I know some friends that absolutely hate all opiates because they get really nauseous from them. Personally, I only get sick if I drink with opiates (seriously.. one beer and I&#039;m throwing up my guts). On the rare occasion when I test my limit, I throw up. If you&#039;ve done other opiates and not gotten sick, you should be okay if you keep the dose low and titrate accordingly.
