				I&#039;ve been a long time lurker on these boards, and its quite apparent that there is a strong bias against the federal government of the United States.&nbsp; While I understand the reasoning, especially due to their staunch rejection of drug legalization and lenient punishments for what seems to be a victimless crime, at least in my eyes.&nbsp; But aside from their actions against drug users, I fail to see what is so wrong with them. Does the ATF really infringe on your rights that much, aside from maybe smacking down a little on some hicks making moonshine?&nbsp; Without taxes, who would pay for national defense from crazies like North Korea, or roads.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how we as a country could get along without some form of the IRS.&nbsp; Even if the current policies of the DEA are flawed and often wasteful, in the future, they could help to regulate dangerous drugs like heroin.&nbsp; And I for one generally welcome law enforcement when I call them.&nbsp; They shut up loud neighbors and where I&#039;m from don&#039;t abuse me or people I know.&nbsp; I sometimes think you all might be a little paranoid or overreacting, which in some cases is good, but all the time, even when doing nothing illegal seems a bit crazzyyy. <br />I&#039;d love to hear what you think on the issue, I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t going to be popular, but some debate would be great.<br /><br />This really isn&#039;t trolling, I&#039;m curious to hear your opinions. I love discussions and this seems like a great place to have one.

				I stopped at I fail to see what is wrong with them.&nbsp; They kill innocent people.&nbsp; They protect the one percenters.&nbsp; They import mass quantities of narcotics.&nbsp; They then lock up people like us for those narcotics.&nbsp; They are corrupt.&nbsp; Did I mention they kill innocent people?<br /><br />I mean seriously.&nbsp; In the 80s the FDA and American government told Bayer &quot;no you cant continue to give Americans a flue vaccine that you know contains the AIDs virus, give it to other countries&quot;, and they did.&nbsp; They continue to invade other countries and kill innocent people.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t corrupt you then they kill you, like the former president of Ecuador.&nbsp; They tried to bribe him like the leaders of every other country but he refused and he was killed in a plane crash.<br /><br />Look at Sandy Hook.&nbsp; Look at 9/11.&nbsp; Is this acceptable?&nbsp; Not to me.<br /><br />Look at the pollution.&nbsp; Look at our illegally contaminated tap water that a lot of the US has.&nbsp; Look how Monsanto is being protected.&nbsp; I can&#039;t legally grow fruits and veggies from seeds I got out my produce at the store????&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know what to say to that.<br /><br />That&#039;s scratching the tip of the ice berg right now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve g2g, shit to do.&nbsp; Pull the wool back from your eyes, open them widely and you have a nice day.

				The federal government in the united states is extremely wasteful.&nbsp; If they were just building roads and employing firefighters i would happily contribute my fair share of taxes.&nbsp; The TSA is a prime example of government waste.&nbsp; The TSA has not caught a single terrorist, but they have felt up countless people, ruptured a travelers colostomy bag, searched a disabled girl in a wheelchair on her way to Disney world, ect.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see your point that the ATF doesn&#039;t infringe on most Americans rights, but on the flip side what has the ATF done for you lately?<br /><br />On national defense, i don&#039;t think that any country could really attack the US and come out on top.&nbsp; North Korea doesn&#039;t have a missile that could reach the united states.&nbsp; Plus they have much larger problems to deal with, like feeding their starving population.&nbsp; I think US foreign policy does more harm than good, we create enemies with the policies currently in place.<br /><br />An example would be drones strikes in the middle east.&nbsp; If someone i loved was killed in a drone strike only because they happened to be eating lunch at the same resteraunt a terrorist was eating at, i too would hate america and wage war against them in whatever way possible.&nbsp;

				Just because you live in a nice place doesn&#039;t mean that shits not fucked up in other places. <br /><br /><br />Watch some Vice documentaries... See how others are being treated by the wonderful police.<br /><br />Sure their needed but If a lot of that &quot;enforcement&quot; money went towards actually helping some of these people.. Things would be a lot better for them. It blows me away that places exist were people are getting shot at daily...

				You are a fed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck off.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are here to get inside our minds a bit and understand us.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are psychotic, we are depressed, we are angry,&#039;we will do no harm as long as we can get drugs.&nbsp; Take that away and prepare for an increase in law enforcement budgets and taxes.&nbsp; We will make society pay and pay and pay until we win his war.
