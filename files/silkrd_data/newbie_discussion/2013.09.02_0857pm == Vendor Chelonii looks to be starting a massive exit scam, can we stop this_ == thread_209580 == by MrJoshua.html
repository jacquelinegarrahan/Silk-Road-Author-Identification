				Take a look at this vendor: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b33aa0f7a5<br /><br />All the signs are there, but the biggest clue yet he&#039;s pulling an exit scam is right there in his listings.<br /><br />He lists a $30 Allyescaline as US shipping only but has the 10g $1200 Allyescaline listing for worldwide! <br /><br />His feedback is all from bullshit orders a month ago.<br /><br />Plus, if you look at his four listings for Allyescaline, they are identical to another vendor, chroot. He is so lazy he&#039;s just copying other people&#039;s listings at this point.<br /><br />Do not FE. You&#039;ve been warned.<br /><br />

				Well hi guys!<br /><br />I&#039;m Chelonii and I&#039;m going to take this place over whether Joshua likes it or not.<br /><br />Long time vendor here, though I am just getting use to SR. And no I&#039;ll never ask you to pay outside of SR AND no I&#039;ll never accept offers of payment outside of SR. Keeping aliases separate. Don&#039;t even ask about the others.<br /><br />Of course I&#039;m going to say... I&#039;m not a scammer and I&#039;ll never be a scammer, but you guys are just meeting me and SR is full of bad people, so I understand how very little headway that&#039;ll make. <br /><br />I appreciate Joshua assuming the role of sheriff, though he was very rude and very ignorant. I don&#039;t know him, but I&#039;m hoping that he genuinely wants to protect everyone, though perhaps he just wants to ruin me before I get things going. I have no idea whether or not Joshua has any interest vested in the same markets as I do and I don&#039;t really care, because I&#039;m not going anywhere. I don&#039;t know how to make people&#039;s feedback not &quot;bullshit...&quot; and I&#039;m not going to avoid listing my products just because someone else offers them. It&#039;s not impossible that multiple people sell the same product. If a lab sold to only one person... they would be gone very quickly. So I would say its very very likely that multiple people offer the same product and it&#039;s a common business practice to price match.<br /><br />Now... massive exit scam you say? Sorry man... I value reputation very much and if you knew the other aliases, you&#039;d see my integrity, but you don&#039;t... and I understand that as well, but if you think I&#039;m going to burn a badass name like Chelonii to make a thousand bucks you are VERY WRONG SIR. Might seem stupid to you, a name versus a thousand bucks, but I don&#039;t see you burning your SSN card any day soon and that&#039;s exactly how I think of my aliases. I feel for those that have been scammed, and yes it sucks that there are scammers out there, but don&#039;t try to burn my reputation, because I&#039;m here to better this community and I&#039;ve done absolutely nothing to warrant your allegations.<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;ve just started up... so please please please absolutely wait for more feedback until you feel comfortable enough to order from me. That break in my feedback Joshua speaks of is due to events associated with this time of year... to avoid going into detail... I&#039;ll just point out things like labor day, the end of summer, the general human need for a few last hoorays before the seasonal ass kickings start in again.<br /><br />Now, my reasoning for offering low MOQ products domestically only is because I&#039;m not wasting my time to send 500mg overseas. Hopefully that right there says it all, but I&#039;ll dig deeper into the thinking of Chelonii.<br /><br />As Chelonii... I value coin... I&#039;m pegged to coin, I do not hedge escrow. I do not value the dollar... I do not seek to exchange into dollars... but yes it takes dollars to ship packages... 500mg product&#039;s worth of coin, even if you are also paying to cover international shipping, is not worth spending that many dollars to send a package overseas. I&#039;m trying to turn product into coin. Not dollars into coin. And that&#039;s what paying shipping costs does. Its a direct, nonprofitable exchange. Thus, I will seek to minimize the amount of nonprofitable exchange I must make in order to operate.<br /><br />Now... if someone overseas wants to spend a large amount of coin on a bulk listing, of course its worth spending the dollars so that I don&#039;t miss out on a significantly sized order. So I&#039;ll accept that my dollars have been turned into coin without any profit from the exchange, because I still make a decent amount of coin.<br /><br />I understand, to a degree, why you are playing sheriff and picking on me, because I am new here, so I&#039;ll shrug off your allegations and your incredibly rude commentary and continue conducting business as usual. <br /><br />And regarding d33pblu3, yes, they did place an international order, which prompted my realization that I really don&#039;t want to deal with international shipping cost unless the buyer is buying bulk, it absolutely wasn&#039;t for 25i, but I&#039;m sure d33pblu3 knows that having escrowed a 25c listing, I&#039;m sure that was just a typo on d33p&#039;s part. I absolutely will not carry 25i. So don&#039;t associate it with me. I&#039;m your go to guy if you want NBOMes, just not that one.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how I&#039;m going to pull an exit scam off here anyways, because I won&#039;t be asking anyone to FE, unless of course they have buyer stats that make me go erg... and that seems to be the way other vendors conduct their business as well. I don&#039;t see how I can or should be any different.<br /><br />If you want a bulk order... then I hope you have some decent stats, because I won&#039;t ask a bulk buyer to FE, I just won&#039;t take the order. If you are ordering bulk, I&#039;d prefer to work with someone with experience anyway, not some average joe or joy who just figured out there&#039;s more to the iceberg. Last thing I want to do is send bulk to LE, even though I run a legal business. If you don&#039;t have the stats, I can&#039;t see what business you have buying bulk anyway and I don&#039;t care if you can justify it, it&#039;s just not going to happen.<br /><br />I will not put myself in an uncomfortable situation just to make a sale. Now you might say... &quot;Well Chelonii... what if someone international wants to see the product before ordering bulk?&quot;<br /><br />I would promptly respond, &quot;I&#039;m sorry that&#039;s the policy.&quot; If you order a listing, that is exactly what you are getting, a pure and verified product. In my experience, 10 grams are standard for international orders anyways. I&#039;m sorry if you aren&#039;t in the know enough for that to be common sense.<br /><br />Now, I think I&#039;ve been pretty kind about what I&#039;d consider to be a very very rude and unwarranted allegation. So I will kindly ask you to back off and let me do what I do. I&#039;m here because I have great products and I&#039;d like to be an asset to this community.<br /><br />p.s: Check my allyl listing, I put a special picture for you MrJoshua sir, because I appreciate all the attention you are getting me. Don&#039;t feel too special though, in time I will go back to my lovely turtles... because even turtles can make it in the desert. <br /><br />I also reserve the right to change my policy and terms of service whenever I want. If I want to offer my all my listings worldwide or make all my listings domestically exclusive, I will in a heartbeat, I will always act on my reasoning as is.

Then may I ask, if you&#039;re a long time vendor how come when I went to your listings you didn&#039;t even have a public pgp key? You don&#039;t have a key displayed on your vendor profile either. This is literally the FIRST thing a new vendor does, so tell me again, how long have you been vending here?<br /><br />Because through my eyes your account isn&#039;t even a month old, and it looks like you just took other people&#039;s listings and copied them verbatim, down to the exact amounts and even prices amazingly enough. <br /><br />And every other person posting in this thread also senses a scam, so you&#039;ve got some work to do if you want to mend your image. First off, it&#039;s against the rules to vend without a pgp key so maybe start there before you tell us all how experienced and professional you are. <br />

				Even if it&#039;s not official, if you&#039;re selling a product and your vendor profile is two sentences and every listing you have says only this &quot;This is the most gorgeous salt I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; and nothing else, no PGP key, no nothing, I&#039;m gonna be skeptical as hell.<br /><br />I still say anyone giving this vendor money is a moron, but whatever, keep selling bro, more power to you. <br /><br />I appreciate the nod to me the photo, and the bottle of everclear is classy like a mofo. You must get a lot of ladies I bet. Of course you do, what am I thinking.

				Ahhh man... I knew there were some good people. Feeling the warmth! Thank you so much guys. I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate you guys for the support. It really really really means more to me than I could express. It is so nice to see support right after someone says something like, &quot;everyone knows you are a scammer.&quot;<br /><br />I am absolutely here to do some good and to help support the community, anything but take away from it and its members. I hope that my attitude, integrity, and even my listings demonstrate that. You won&#039;t find me associated with things like cathinones, you won&#039;t find me crossing into illegal territory, you won&#039;t find me trying to swindle, snake, snatch, or take. I&#039;m here to stand for what little rights we have and to share the few things I still can. I absolutely appreciate all the other vendors on SR, I&#039;m just as bold, so I&#039;m taking a different approach here. <br /><br />I want nothing more than a fighting chance here.<br /><br />To Joshua, I never meant for that to be taken as: long time here... as in here... the community of SR.&nbsp; I meant, I&#039;ve been vending for a long time, but yes I am absolutely new here and I am sure that there is more for me to learn. And even though you&#039;ve been far from kind and far from welcoming... I appreciate you letting me know that you were uncomfortable with the image I projected. Even though I hope that there are few of you... hehe... I do have a Michael Scott complex.<br /><br />So I apologize to the community for procrastinating the creation of Chelonii&#039;s key, I wanted to get my foot in the door and I neglected some common practices here, but it is available for anyone now. <br /><br />Oh and the everclear... bahahaha, I&#039;m sure you loved that more than expressed Joshua lover sir... that was not just for our date... it was for a size comparison and it was sitting right there, because it makes a great cleaning agent for chemicals, specifically NBOMe, which I&#039;m sure most know is not something you want contaminating your space.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t know if anyone can really see it... but that tiny little bag to the bottom right... that&#039;s a 5 gram rock of 25C. So I hope to everyone it&#039;s very apparent how absolutely absurd this allegation is.

				I&#039;m not trying to hurt his business, I&#039;m just pointing out that his entire operation appears like an exit scam. Look at my previous posts, I was the first to alert the forums that MushroomMagician was breaking bad two weeks ago and nobody believed me. Now a week later and it&#039;s obvious, I feel I saved some new buyers a scam. Chelonii&#039;s listings look awfully like a scam, so I pointed it out.<br /><br />For example, why would a vendor list his cheap $30 listings for United States only, yet his one bulk listing for $1200 is for worldwide shipping? Same product, yet in smaller amounts you only get to ship to US?<br /><br />That raises a red flag. So does the fact that he had no PGP key, and all his listings were a single sentence that said &quot;Man this salt is good.&quot; No word on shipping, escrow, nothing about the product, etc.<br /><br />He&#039;s fixed a lot of these issues and if he&#039;s legit I wish him the best of luck.

				It just goes to show the danger of leaping to conclusions.<br /><br />Threads like this can really hurt a vendor&#039;s business, for no reason other than a random person has leapt to a conclusion, based upon assumption and sketchy evidence.<br />

I also haven&#039;t scammed anyone, nor have I made even the tiniest mistake. The only thing I forgot to do when starting up was post a PGP key and of course I apologized to the people who prefer to communicate that way. Even that... was not a mistake. It&#039;s not in the rules. It&#039;s just a prevalent preference in the SR community. If I didn&#039;t want to use PGP... I could easily not use it.<br /><br />Other than that... I price matched the market, I didn&#039;t &quot;copy&quot; listing by listing... I applied a basic business strategy. I also don&#039;t see what more information is required in the description of my listings... it says it right there in the title. You get what you bought. A verified product.<br /><br />To say I&#039;m sloppy is very insulting, though fortunately not as insulting as questioning my legitimacy. I go through great lengths to procure, verify, take orders, fulfill orders, and ship orders. You say sloppy... and I say... there&#039;s much more important things to do than making everything pretty.<br /><br />Also, to address your misinformation/lie... my feedback is for products that I do in fact continue to sell... All my products that were sold before are still available, and I have ever intention on keeping consistent stock, so that you never have to wait for a restock.<br /><br />Now, regarding my forum presence / review thread... I think the feedback system as well as the discussion system covers that on its own. In the future I will absolutely create a review thread regardless of the feedback/discussion systems accomplishing the same results, but that&#039;s very far from my priority. <br /><br />You can give -1 karma because the crowd has justifiable turned against you, but making up stuff is just not okay. I don&#039;t believe you belong in this community whatsoever. A good sheriff is a valuable commodity to a community, an ignorant one however... well... you speak for yourself.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t understand your ranting... if you have decent buyer stats, of course you won&#039;t be asked to FE. And if its bulk and you have bad stats... then... I just won&#039;t work with you. Continue carrying on, its just bumping this thread.
