				I have found some info on this subject on the forum but I wanted to pose the question myself. I have yet to make a purchase and I really have no problem with having packages mailed to my home address. My wife, on the other hand, is concerned about it and I can understand. She is asking me to set up a PO box. I don&#039;t intend to purchase any &quot;smelly&quot; products from here. My interest is in LSD tabs only for now. The plan would be to purchase at least 20 or 25 hits at a time which would be for my personal consumption and it would take some time before I used this many doses....I would dose once per week or twice per month and perhaps only a half tab at a time depending on the circumstance. I have cluster headache so the use is primarily for medicinal purposes. My point is that I would not have too many instances of this package arriving. Would it be more or less conspicuous to have it delivered to the PO box or to my home? It would be the only package ever delivered to the PO box since I do not plan on having all my mail delivered to the box.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks!

				i would go with the p.o. box. happy wife happy life! i would also generate some &quot;junk mail&quot; to the p.o. box so that your orders dont stand out. just goto any website that is trying to sell you something and get on their mailing list with your p.o. box .&nbsp; they will likely package your address with others and sell it off to other companies who bomb mailboxes with mailing lists.<br /><br />i would use a mailbox that has 24 hour access and go in the wee hours of the morning to pick up so if the pigs are watching they will be exposed more easily<br /><br />in addition, when you recieve your first few orders from the po i would write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package,leave it in the box and walk out. return in 45 mins and then take it with me. that way if they are watching and approach you, there is plausible&nbsp; deniability that it was a mistake.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d say go with the P.O. Box, they&#039;re so convenient for basically everything. Truthfully I&#039;m a n00b so I&#039;m not sure whether I&#039;d recommend setting one up with your real dox or some novelties. Novelty would be ideal but at the same time if you happen to get an astute eagle eyed employee or something doesn&#039;t scan right you could be on the hook for trying to use a falsified government ID at a government facility so it&#039;s hard to tell what you could get stuck with there. With your real name you could at least theoretically put an alias on a &quot;test&quot; shipment of low value and see if it gets through. I imagine LSD would be one of the safer substances to order. <br /><br />You should start getting junk mail automatically with the box, or at least I did. If you want to step it up some send some dummy letters to yourself occasionally and order a subscription or something to it. <br /><br />Also as has been said always go at night. This makes it easier to identify potential surveillance and makes it easier to go in and get out quickly and before arousing any suspicion. If you open your box and see a package that looks suspicious or like it&#039;s been opened, DON&#039;T TAKE IT. Remove it from the box and look it over while trying to give your best puzzled look as if you genuinely don&#039;t know wtf this is even for, then put it back in the box and walk away. If there&#039;s anybody watching they&#039;ll assume that you weren&#039;t aware anything was coming, and you can go back in a couple days to see if it&#039;s still there.

				a suggestion, whether PO box or home delivery - i&#039;ve had mail for someone named xxx delivered here for almost 8 years. I&#039;ve lived in the same house for 23 years and have never met or heard of the guy named on the mail - most of it is junk mail, but one item was a fringing rebate check from Jim beam whiskey. It was a postcard that was a check, so i didn&#039;t open it. Point is, in the garage i&#039;ve saved a few pcs of mail that looked important (including the jim beam rebate), in case he ever shows up.<br /><br />point is i&#039;m thinking to have whateveri purchase sent in his name, with the earlier mail serving as cover ie to further plausible deniability. When (if) it arrives, i&#039;ll leave the package with his other mail for a few weeks - you get the point<br /><br />while i agree with the &quot;happy wife/happy life&quot; suggestion, the above wouldn&#039;t work as well with the PO box delivery<br /><br />FWIW<br /><br /><br />still trying to figure out how i got a -1 karma with only 10 posts

				Right on peeps thanks for the replies. Is it me or does it seem I would worry MUCH LESS with potential surveillance by having the shit sent to my home to me by my real name? If my wife sees the word &quot;surveillance&quot; associated with the PO box idea, she may think different. Just tossing it out there&nbsp; :(

				firstly my answer would depend if it is local or over seas order ....<br />for all my deliveries (using the road for at least 12 months) anything with in my country ive had delivered to my home address (pills, weed, weight loss just to name a few) .... too much mail gets sent each day all over thee country for it to be picked up plus there isnt the man power to check everything (plus LSD does not smell so dogs cant detect it) and most vendors use express over night <br />if you are purchasing from overseas then i would suggest the box ... like the above says write RTS on it straight away .... with me i take all my mail with me and drive around for a little while see if anyone is following ... if youre being watched, and LE having knowledge that you are carrying something they have a small amount of time to pick you up (i believe its something between 5-10 min) as they cant risk any illegal substance going back into society it needs to be obtained there and then basically. hope this helps :)

				To be honest it doesnt matter. Both will go through the same sorting process ect. and are equally likely to get intercepted and both are tied to your name. You get a lot less plausibly denyability if you send it to a PO box because who else knows you have a PO box ect. I would only use a PO box if I set it up with a fake name &amp; fake ID.
