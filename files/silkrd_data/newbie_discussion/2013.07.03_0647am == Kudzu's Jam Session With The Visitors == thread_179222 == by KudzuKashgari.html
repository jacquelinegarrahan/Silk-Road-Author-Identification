				Part 1:&nbsp; Independence Day<br /><br />It was July 4th, 2012.&nbsp; I had smoked a big cigar to celebrate the evening, and retired to my futon on the porch.&nbsp; I lie down, restless, and try to get some shut eye.&nbsp; As I begin to drift to that thin line between sleep and wakefulness, I start to feel strange.&nbsp; It was like the sensation you get when you have a strong emotional response to music, but without any sound: it stimulated me directly, in my nervous system.&nbsp; Shocked and slightly perturbed, I sit up and open my eyes.&nbsp; I look over to the dog sleeping on its bed and am surprised to see that it is sleeping soundly.&nbsp; Relieved that the dog isn&#039;t scared, I decide that there probably isn&#039;t a reason for me to be either.&nbsp; So I lie back down and close my eyes again.&nbsp; The sensation comes back stronger.

				Part 2:&nbsp; Them<br /><br />The sensation was like my nervous system was an instrument of immense complexity, and there was something playing it.&nbsp; The feeling causes me to black out, and what I recall next could not be remembered until after I woke up the next day, as though it were blocked externally or internally.&nbsp; I come to my senses for about 2.5 seconds in a very dark place.&nbsp; In front of me just out of arms&#039; length are three beings who stand at about 1 - 1.25 meters tall.&nbsp; Their skin has the texture of gun metal, but with the color of titanium.&nbsp; Their heads are over sized in proportion to their bodies, and their eyes are large and almond shaped.&nbsp; Behind them is a black dome which is about one meter in diameter, and one meter tall.&nbsp; I hypothesize that this has some important function in the space that I find myself in.&nbsp; Though standing, I feel completely paralyzed, but I begin to regain my senses, though still hypnotized.

				Part 3:&nbsp; The Light Show<br /><br />Suddenly, the being farthest to the left starts to emit a glow from where the pineal gland would be in a human.&nbsp; The light was green, and it looked like molten glass.&nbsp; It became extremely bright, and I could feel a similar sensation as when I was falling asleep.&nbsp; Then the being in the middle did the same thing, but with a yellow color, and a different sensation that layered on top of the first one&#039;s frequency.&nbsp; The being farthest to the left did the same, but with a red color.&nbsp; As soon as all of their &#039;lights&#039; were on, a thread like molten glass being blown was emitted from the green being, then the yellow being, and then the red being.&nbsp; As soon as they all touched my forehead, I blacked out and woke up the next morning none the wiser.&nbsp; Someone I know happened to ask me what my favorite colors are when I made my way to the kitchen.&nbsp; &quot; Red and yellow,&quot; I told them.&nbsp; Knowing that red, yellow, and green are my favorites, I wondered why I would leave one out.&nbsp; This triggered the whole memory back, and I had to go sit down to make sense of it.&nbsp; I have had several other notable experiences with these &#039;Traveling Musicians,&#039; and am very open to chat with anyone who replies to this with an interest in the subject.
