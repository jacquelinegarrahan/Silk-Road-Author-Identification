				Bitinstant is the only bitcoin service I use. It works really well, for the most part. They are having some issues this week, however. Also, how to open the links? Are you using TOR browser? (obviously, you are...just highlight the link, right-click, and hit &quot;open&quot; or &quot;Open link in new tab.&quot;

				welcome to the road!<br /><br />I find to good bitcoin sites to be localbitcoins.com and bitbargain.com! they are both quite easy to use (much easier than most other methods) <br /><br />I don&#039;t quite understand what you mean with the links but I&#039;m guessing you mean links to forum threads like the one below:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171691<br /><br />What i do is just open a new tab at the top and then copy and paste the link into the address bar but you can also highlight, right click and then select open from the drop down menu!<br /><br />The link above is for a thread started by someone new and I have posted some information in there that may be helpful to you as well!<br /><br />

				Hello and welcome to the forums,<br /><br />To answer your first question i would go here : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/25045a8e31<br /><br />Medicine Woman has made a very helpful guide, she isn&#039;t here to scam i was one of the first to download the PDF as everyone was crying how it was unsafe, you no longer need to download a PDF as the info has been made available in the product description. <br /><br />Your second question i don&#039;t quite understand, i think you are seeing URLs which are not links (you cannot click them and expect them to take you to the webpage) you need to highlight them and copy and paste the URL in your browser. If this isn&#039;t the answer you were looking for please reword the question.

				Lots of good info above.&nbsp; I think someone already mentioned localbitcoins ... so I just wanted to second that nomination and share my experience <br /><br />localbitcoins.com is awesome and gives you lots of different options for buying bitcoins and once the deal is done you get the BTC immediately.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not familiar with BTC beware that it can take hours to transfer - some exchanges let you &quot;jump the queue&quot; if you agree to give a tiny percentage in processing fees (like 0.01 BTC, etc.).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, even some of the prominent exchanges like blockchain.info seem to have fairly frequent technical issues so it might be an idea to allow heaps of time for bitcoins to reach their destination.<br />
