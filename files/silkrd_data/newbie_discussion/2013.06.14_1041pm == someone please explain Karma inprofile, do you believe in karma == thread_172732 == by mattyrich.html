				i did not know what it meant either.<br />How do you give out karma?<br />If its just based on someone not liking a post or doing it on purpose it does not mean much.<br />I am not into popularity contests for forum posts.<br />Everyone has an opinion and there are entitled to it.<br />(unless totally vulgar nonsense)<br />Whether you disagree or not.<br />Just disagree in a reply.<br />I never judge anyone or their opinions.<br />You make judgements/etc by your own life experience and that is all you can comment on.<br />Not hypotheticals.<br />Also never judge someone till you have walked&nbsp; a mile in their shoes is another good one.<br /><br />

You see people post &quot;+1 Karma to you and you and you&quot; but never -1 to you. I use to think the lowest form of life on the planet is scammers, liars, and snitches. Now I think itâ€™s the assholes anonymously giving out negative Karma...E-Thugs, Internet tough guys.

Now that was a real asshole (and he was a vendor nonetheless)!<br /><br />Anothe great example is the noob Cannaconnection who seems to be spamming the newbie section with useless info-gathering threads, and juvenile topics! He is a moron, and if you look at his karma it says +2, and -15. In this case it helps you quickly decide that this guy should not be taken seriously, and neither should all his ridiculous threads!<br /><br />I think that there is some justification to the karma system, but again, a lot of people dont use it the right way, so its not entirely reliable, and should be take with a grain of salt.<br />

				From what I can tell and from what I&#039;ve experienced in different forums, you should try and make sure you&#039;re giving karma to people who are making helpful/informative posts so other users have an idea about who to trust and/or go to for advice. If you upvote or downvote depending on your mood or in accordance with who your friends are you&#039;re kind of fucking up the system. The karma system isn&#039;t necessarily foolproof when you&#039;re trying to determine who to interact with but it&#039;s a good starting point. Just my opinion! :)

				Thank you so much to everyone who helped me out with this. Now I&#039;m a little disappointed that I have -2 because I feel like I&#039;m a pretty real and kind, thoughtful person. Damn I will have to try harder to not be cunty at all. Thanks again everyone
