				Might as well have a Newbie version of one of the most popular threads in the Rumor Mill.<br />Since I am not allowed to post there anymore, even though I have posted in the past.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ll kick off with my review of eMonkey:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4ef5547148<br /><br />I&#039;ve had several orders with this person, and both were the smoothest, best transactions I have EVER had on the Silk Road.<br />Great communication, incredibly fast shipping times from the Netherlands to North America (seriously, the longest I waited was a week. That is FIVE business days.)<br />Package stealth was INCREDIBLE and innovative.<br /><br />Now to quality:<br />Ordered his Space Monkey pills and Crystal MDMA shards on different occasions. The pills took a while to work, but were strong and clean. The MDMA crystals were among the best I&#039;ve had recently as well.<br />I can&#039;t recommend eMonkey highly enough, they are a consummate professional. It is worth the slight premium on Gram prices for me to order over and over. I will pay a bit extra for peace of mind and FAST SHIPPING from europe!

				I ordered 1g from easyjet, it took about 14-16 days to arrive to the US. Product was nice, white crystals, a bit of powder, rolled hard on this, although had more tweakiness to it than other MDMA I&#039;ve had. I also found this stuff to be slightly psychedelic at higher doses (160mg vs the 120mg I did the first time with it). Haven&#039;t seen him around at all in the past few months though. He had good prices (~$40-50/g)<br /><br />I ordered 5g from cloudsurfer. Shipping took about 2 weeks during the holiday season, stealth was awesome, product was about .5g overweight and consisted of tan rocks, nice ~100mg chunks, and a .95g rock. This MDMA had me feeling extremely nice, and seemed to have a nicer more relaxing roll than the stuff I got from easyjet. This was the best MDMA I&#039;ve had to date. I took 160mg, the other people rolling took around 130-140mg and had an intense roll.<br /><br />I just placed a 5g order with Symbosis, and am awaiting on that to arrive. Will update when I receive it.

				I have tried Dutch and AfterHours MDMA as far as overseas vendors, and there stuff is remarkable. For US domestic, I got ten grams of MDA from ILF around the holidays, and everyone, including myself had rave reviews.

				JesusOfRave no longer with us but i just got 10g of his mdma, source G. And wow. Very chilled and relaxed high, very very euphoric. Pure love at .12 and a redose of .12 1 hour later. I had an incredible experience with it.

				I have been buying from Reich - fast shipping, incredible stealth and the best MDMA I&#039;ve ever had. <br /><br />I generally prefer to take MDMA orally as I find the high is deeper and lasts longer, but last night we snorted Reich&#039;s MDMA and we were all flying within 10-15 minutes. A very clean warm high. <br /><br />
