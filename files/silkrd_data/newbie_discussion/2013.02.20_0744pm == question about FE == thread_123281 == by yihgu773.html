				I&#039;m new to SR obviously, I don&#039;t have any rep or anything so I&#039;m wondering who I should go (vendor-wise) to for weed in the UK that doesn&#039;t require FE. I was going to go with MrCronk but I&#039;m just not sure whether I&#039;ll get anything seeing how everyone seems to say &quot;never under any circumstances FE&quot;<br /><br />Anyone got any ideas?

				you will be fine, MrCronk means that the escrow system is put in place for your safety and finalizing early defeats the purpose

				ah ok. i was wondering what would stop a vendor from just not sending the order once someone finalized it? <br />does this escrow system mean the vendor won&#039;t get paid until the order has come through or what&#039;s going on there?

				screw FE.. Find a vendor that honors the escrow system that has been implemented for the customers protection.&nbsp; Vendors should not expect to make new users feel uneasy and still place orders.<br /><br />
