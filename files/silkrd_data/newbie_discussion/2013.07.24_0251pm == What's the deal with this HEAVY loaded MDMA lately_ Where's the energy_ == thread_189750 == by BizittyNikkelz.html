				The good old MD I used to have had a euphoric burst of energy, I&#039;d want to hug everyone and tell them how magic they are and how much life is amazing and beautiful. It bubbled and SMOKED in a test kit. <br /><br />This was the last time I had real MD, 2 weeks ago at a festival. Before that it was a year. I&#039;ve ordered MD from several vendors in this time, but the MD hasn&#039;t compared to the REAL DEAL since 2 weeks ago/last year.<br /><br />Everything from the road has lacked energy, had a HEAVY body load with a LOW dose (even at .05 :/ ). The euphoria isn&#039;t as vibrant. The empathy is lacking. And there&#039;s NO afterglow! <br /><br />The real deal had the BEST afterglow - happy and joyful 36 hours after dosing, just a great positive experience.<br /><br />Does anyone on the road have that beautiful banging stuff anymore? It&#039;s hard as fuck to find. <br />Real deal is usually white to light yellowish

				MDMA is not speedy at a proper does.&nbsp; It sounds like that you like MDMA cut with amphetamine, meth or something else to me...

				The stuff I&#039;ve been getting of late is definitely the real deal. Buzzing like crazy after a cap each. <br />Ended up with 4 grown men in the same bed just lying there telling each other what good friends they were. <br /><br />That, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am truely, madly, deeply inlove with MD. <br /><br />It kind of sounds like you&#039;ve been buying M1, but it usually gives more of an energy burst with less of the MD &#039;magic&#039; kind of like your description. There is an MDMA avengers review thread, anything listed there is worth your money me thinks. <br /><br />Unfortunately vendors round my parts are not listed there, so it&#039;s lucky I struck gold (or tan might I say 8) ). For anyone looking in Australia, AusXTC is by far your best bet and has great MD that I didn&#039;t think was available outside europe!<br />&nbsp;<br />@ Jack N Hoff<br /><br />I&#039;d have to disagree with you there pal, I don&#039;t think your doses are high enough&nbsp; ;)<br />

				It&#039;s obviously not the MDMA causing the heavy body load.&nbsp; MDA is a little more speedy, jittery, and slightly more visual (barely!).&nbsp; I&#039;ve had the chance to be doing MDMA from a chemist recently and MDA just last week.&nbsp; I used to think MDA was way more visual, but after having some LEGIT shit I just think the shit I had before was cut with a 2C derivative.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about how mephedrone and methylone get you off, never done &#039;em.<br /><br />I just wish when I got drugs cut with drugs they&#039;d tell me, &quot;Hey freecondomsale, this sass is cut with 2C-B, you&#039;ll be real fuckered up.&nbsp; Also, can I please buy some free condoms.&quot;&nbsp; To which I&#039;d reply, &quot;Sweet, I love drug combos, and yes, you may buy some free condoms.&quot;

				I&#039;m quite familiar with methylone, as it is another favorite substance of mine. But I&#039;m saying the MD i&#039;ve gotten on the road from the last three vendors was so heavy and loaded at only a .05 dose! Not only that, but it just didn&#039;t blast me with euphoria.<br /><br />Dropped a .1 of the really good stuff those couple weeks ago and I knew it was legit.<br /><br />Stuff can be real mdma, but there&#039;s many different forms/isomers of it. Who knows what&#039;s what<br />

				What are the different forms/isomers then?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Virtually all MDMA/MDA is racemic, i.e. a mixture of the R and S isomers.&nbsp; Also, nearly all MDMA/MDA comes as the HCl salt.&nbsp; with the salts only the dosage would be different as they are different molecular weights.<br /><br />What other forms/isomers could there be and how would this effect the experience?&nbsp; Just curious, you might know more than me.

				It sounds like what you associate with &quot;real MDMA&quot; is actually MDMA and amps.&nbsp; The long effect period you describe suggests possibly even meth.
