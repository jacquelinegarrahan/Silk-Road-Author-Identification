				All religions tell us that God is Love.&nbsp; Anyone can turn the bad into good by becoming a conduit of Love.&nbsp; Giving love to everyone, without expecting anything in return.&nbsp; Mystics tell us that anyone who chooses such a path will quickly notice major changes in his or her life.

				When our mind is free of warring emotions and the belief in separateness,<br />Then we will have no fear.<br />No matter where we are on the path,<br />whether we are just beginning or we&#039;ve practiced<br />for years, we&#039;re always stepping farther into <br />groundlessness.

				and love is God&nbsp; ;) <br /><br /><br />&quot;Do not give up your authority and follow blindly the will of others. This way will lead to only delusion.&quot;<br />&quot;Find out for yourself what is truth, what is real. Discover that there are virtuous things and there are non-virtuous things. Once you have discovered for yourself give up the bad and embrace the good.&quot;<br />The Buddha

				This is pretty much how I live. I have noticed a difference in my life. My reputation in my hometown is that of honestly and reliability. Everybody trusts me. And you know how much of that I take advantage of? None. None at all.<br /><br />I see a lot of people hanging around, disrespecting others, not paying debts, saying offensive things, ect...... And they all ask me why such and such was willing to do ______ on my behalf. I just look and laugh. Its a hard thing to explain.

				You say God is love... well God is also the opposite of love ... God is everything, good and evil. He/She will kill such as quickly as He/She will nurture and protect . Yin-Yang shows this clearly... the seed of evil is in good and the seed of good is in evil. It&#039;s all the same energy expressing itself in different ways. :)
