				So here&#039;s the situation. I wanted to place a few orders so I thought to go get a PO box from USPS as I live with relatives and I&#039;d rather not take advantage of their hospitality. Anyways long story short I set up the PO box and everything seemed to be fine but then they called me today and said they can&#039;t do it. I won&#039;t get into the exact reasons why as I don&#039;t wanna give out to much information but it was nothing illegal. I just didn&#039;t meet one of their requirements.<br /><br />So I contacted the sellers and told them not to ship yet but not sure if they got the message before shipped. One seller already shipped. I had the PO do a change of address of the PO box to the residence I&#039;m staying at. This is so fucking annoying. I was all happy over the weekend then first thing Monday morning I have a voicemail from the PO telling me all this and the fucked up part is the guy I talked to when I first opened the PO box said yeah it&#039;s not a problem they can do it and now this. Any advice or suggestions appreciated as I already have a bad feeling I&#039;m not going to see any of my orders.

				You said everything seemed to be fine.&nbsp; Does that mean you had a few things delivered to the PO box before ordering from SR?<br /><br />It reads like you opened a PO box on Thursday, ordered from SR Friday and Monday you the PO called to say your PO box couldn&#039;t be set up.

				I see, I hope you know when someone says &quot;I see&quot; its never good...<br /><br />I feel for you I do but if I were in your shoes I would have sent myself a few things before ordering from SR.&nbsp; I know you were in a hurry so I understand but change of address stuff can take a week to even process so I hope it all works out.<br /><br />In the future any drop you use for SR you may want to get a few posts too first, only because you never know here package like that will end up.

				just tell them you already gave the address out and you will notify anyone you gave it 2 not 2 use it. But will be picking up any mail that comes in. Its a good idea 2 have&nbsp; a months worth of junk mail sent 2 a new drop b4 using it for questionable items. Be creative, you will find ways.

				Thx all for the advice. Ya I should of waited awhile and had junk mail and other mail delivered before I ordered off SR. Guess I was in a hurry. Anyways when I was there at the PO I filled out that mail forwarding slip but I know the PO is a big fuck up in terms of operating so who even knows if that slip will be entered in the system.<br /><br />I should of just bit the bullet and went to UPS. It costs more but at least I wouldn&#039;t had to deal with this BS. One of my orders is in transit now so it&#039;s too late to give the vendor a different address. I guess my next question is do you think Mail forwarding or Hold Mail is better at the PO? Like I&#039;m worried that for the mail forwarding what if the don&#039;t input that information or some other fuck up? It was a pretty good sized order so I&#039;d hate to lose the money. Geez I calculated everything out before I did this and went over everything like a hundred times in my head and I still got fucked over somehow because of a dumbass PO worker that doesn&#039;t know the rules of a company he works for..fing incompetent. <br /><br />So Mail forwarding or Hold Mail 4tw?

				cant you ask someone at the post office if your forwarding address has been added to the system. it would be right of them to forward it or at least hold it for you and give you a chance to pick it up if you explain your situation. hopefully they don&#039;t return it to sender because most people use false return addresses i think in which case you will be out the money and package. if i could i would be there tomorrow morning, telling them they gave you a box, you have mail coming so they better figure it out now that they took it away. did they take the box away because you violated some term in there agreement? in that case they might not have to do anything

				Nah it was totally their mistake. I was 100% honest when setting up the PO box. I even said it was fine when he said that he didn&#039;t think he could sign me up but then he went and asked and said &quot;yep sure np we can do it&#039;. I think I&#039;ve gotten things are going to be alright then, I caught a lucky break =)<br /><br />Now alot of you mentioned about when first getting a PO box that you usually wanna establish it for a month before attempting to order an illicit item. Maybe I&#039;m just dumb or something but I don&#039;t see what&#039;s the difference. Say for example for the next month I order dildo&#039;s, little electronic gadgets and lube and then I order an illicit product how does my prep work help? I would think open the mailbox and order right away because what are the chances they think your first order is going to be illicit. I think us as drug users tend to be a little too paranoid at times and rightfully so but it really is human nature to want to trust people and think good of them.<br /><br />From what I understand things get sketchy when you start receiving products from overseas like China or Netherlands and it&#039;s an at least weekly thing. Now if your getting stuff from China it&#039;s very simple to just state that you have an online store that sells electronic gadgets. Shit you can even put up a storefront and make business cards. I know if I was a reseller that&#039;s what I&#039;d do or if your just extra paranoid. So my point is I don&#039;t see the relevance of waiting a month before placing a first order. If I&#039;m wrong please point out to me so I can consider someone else experience, thank =)

				most people have home mailboxes. often people open p.o boxes because there getting sent something illegal that they dont want sent to there home, just as you did if i remember. the post office knows this. some people think its looks suspicious when someone opens a box and the first thing that shows up is a package. it looks like they opened it just for that and not regular mail service. the postal service is trained to look for possible contraband. most of it is inspecting the package and label but delivery patterns can set off alarms.<br />

				and its not the length of time you wait that we were talking about. its the mail, magazines, decoy parcels, packages you buy online that makes it more secure. if you have a lot of things coming to that p.o box then anything you order of SR just blend right in

				Ok perfect we&#039;re on the same wave length then. I got a Private box somewhere else and plan ordering alot of little things online plus things that I use and need so I can be as inconspicuous as possible. I need my order to come this week so I&#039;ll probably order myself a whole bunch of legal shit so it blends in.

				Ya I remember in high school we had this Drug Day we&#039;re had this thing in the gymnasium and there was a booths and each booth had a different drug displayed(not the actual drug) but like pictures and all the bad effects and gay shit like that. <br /><br />Anyways the recurring theme of that whole theme of the pathetic exhibition was that weed is a gateway drug. HA! They should of displayed prescription drugs.. that&#039;s a bigger gateway drug than weed ever is or was. <br /><br />Ask any opiate addict that gets cut off from their Doctor and can&#039;t score anymore prescription painkillers how fast they&#039;ll go out and turn to heroin just to stop w/d&#039;s. Hey but that&#039;s ok cause the Government is making money off the prescription drugs and weed not so much. IMO weed has no business being a Schedule I drug..like really wtf?! Ummm I never heard of someone smoking so much weed that they turned violent and beat someone to death... bath salts ok...meth mmm it&#039;s possible but weed fuck no. It&#039;s retarded.
