			<dd class="postbody">
				Anyone have stories of responsible amphetamine use? I have some experience with adderall while i was in school, and since then I&#039;ve bought some speed off SR but I am currently waiting on a batch of what should be great quality. <br /><br />what&#039;s the best way to get maximum bang for my buck? I&#039;m looking for increased productivity and not to get high (though i&#039;ll be damned if it happens!)<br /><br />For instance, will using small doses twice a week drive up tolerance? Once a week? I&#039;ve never taken amphetamine to stay up ridiculous hours...what time of day do people take it in? I usually wait till breakfast is mostly out of my stomach and then take it before lunch...but i&#039;d be interested in hearing about the safety (with regards to toxicity) of taking it in the evening and then staying up all night. I&#039;ve also never redosed- I assume this really drives up tolerance....<br /><br />just looking to start a discussion on the matter

				Please don&#039;t do that, it can&#039;t end well. Responsible drug use is about having the discipline to use moderately and infrequently even though you&#039;d rather be high all the time. The situation you describe is habit forming behaviour, it will quickly lead to you depending on the drugs to get mundane tasks done while you deny that you have a problem.

				Yeah its going to form a habit from the scenario you described. If you take a big amphetamine dose in the morning, even if you don&#039;t redose you will likely be up until late at night. I used to set my alarm for 4 in the morning, wake up and take my dose of amphetamines and then go back to sleep, this would leave me sleepless until after 2 in the morning the next night. This means that to the same degree that you increased your productivity while on the amphetamines, your productivity will decrease while coming down. This become undesirable with regular use which is why most users end up binging and staying up for long periods of time and then sleeping for long periods of time. Either way if you plan on using it &quot;once a week&quot; you will probably end up trying to kick the habit eventually. Never been addicted to speed but hope my experience helps.

				Maybe I should have stated that I know the danger of amphetamines. I appreciate the sentiment. I guess it was a stupid question, though, because I&#039;m not really considering any other use for amphetamines than once a week in moderate doses, which I believe to be relatively safe.

				There is a very good thread detailing good Methamphetamine practice, how much/little to take to avoid building tolerance and such like. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0

				just to make sure, you plan on using amphs on regular bases?<br />using stimulants in daily life ( to go to work/school) is fun but after a while you will have difficulties finding a reason not to use them.<br />take it from someone whose amp addiction started out exactly that way. (kicked the habit a couple of years ago though&nbsp; 8) )<br /><br />i&#039;d say take the amphs you ordered to have fun ( an all-nighter).

				Two things to take away from this thread. OK, three things.<br /><br />1. Threads on the SR forum should be colloquially renamed threats.<br />2. Drug use spurs sudden increases of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) in liver cells. That is, the liver starts making all these extra ribosomes to make proteins to enzymatically destroy the new toxins in the body. Granted that these &quot;toxins&quot; are pleasurable, the unconscious effects--what you do not feel directly--are two fold. The liver is the first step (along with alterations to heart/kidney function).<br />3. Mental health is the second effect. Watch the Matrix. This is a really good example of what drugs are doing to your brain. Those of you that are familiar with mental illness, or those that suffer from mental illness, know firsthand what it is like to experience mental stress. Neurological impairments are not always permanent, but the consequences of habitual drug use without professional psychological consultation is irreparable.<br /><br />If you first learn what can go wrong, then maybe you can experience cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin--the Big Three--without committing crimes, suicide, or violent acts. If you are at risk of committing homicide or suicide, seek help. Check into a psychiatric hospital. Tell them your problems. You&#039;ll get help. You&#039;ll get a second chance. You won&#039;t get a second chance in prison, because prison will transform you more than any drug ever did.
