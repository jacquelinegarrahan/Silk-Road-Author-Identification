				Marijuana is the best drug because I use it to get me stoned, help me sleep, and she is essentially my constant companion.<br />LSD is the best drug because it enhances and flips and realigns and because it helped me GREATLY with my depression.<br />MDMA is the best drug because in the right setting with the right people it can make you rave or sort your head out, reach for the lasers or talk out the trauma and get rid of the PTSD, it&#039;s all the same.<br />DMT is the best drug because it takes me to a place which is real and unreal and which I will never see all of but never tire of visiting.<br />Cocaine is very occasionally the best drug because doing lines is just fun alright, it&#039;s a great deal of fun&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />If I had to choose one...I would be rather upset. If I had to choose one occasional drug...LSD, but I&#039;d miss the MDMA, not quite finished with that yet&nbsp; :)

				I like how cannabis is such a useful crutch for every day life. It eases being, and generally makes things more enjoyable for me.<br />Psychedelics are almost like religious practice for me. Communion with the great who knows. They both expand and define my parameters, and the parameters of my reality; BEAUTIFULLY.<br />Coke and MDMA are enjoyable, but kind of a whory bunch... <br />Haven&#039;t tried opiates beyond having morphine while in hospital.

				LSD for me so far. The only time I&#039;ve done DMT I had a bit of a weird and unpleasant experience for various reasons, I&#039;m hoping next time I try it I&#039;ll have learned from those mistakes because from what I&#039;ve read/heard about DMT it can be beyond amazing.

None of those &quot;alternatives&quot; (with maybe the exception of MDA) even come close to what that substance achieves. It&#039;s great. Mephedrone is especially a waste of your time, money and brain resources - and methylone is what most people are selling as &quot;molly&quot; on the street these days. None of it compares.
