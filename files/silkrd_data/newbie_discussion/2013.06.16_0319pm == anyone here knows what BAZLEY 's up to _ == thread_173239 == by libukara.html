He went into stealth mode for 3-4 days right before his unexplainable absence. And it looks like most of the delivery&#039;s the last 1-2 weeks didn&#039;t make it. So sadly I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he got busted. He got online though about 3 days ago so not sure whats up with that. Maybe the police got access to his account? <br /><br />I&#039;m only guessing here so if anyone got info on this please post it.

				the busted scenario is unlikely IMO, but possible i guess. He was not seen for 8 days or so, popped in for 1 day, then its been another 8 days now and nothing. After a few very successful orders arriving from him, I am waiting for 1 order sent almost 2 months ago from him + another sent over 3 weeks ago, and another which should have arrived. 3 orders you ask....well the first was a small one, the second a replacement, the 3rd for a friend. If other shit was not showing up id be less suspicious, but other stuff from other vendors DOES show up. It&#039;s just all his items that have not. Shame as he seemed so genuine and such a nice guy and i had plans of remaining a customer for a very long time. I can only hope i am wrong, but i feel as though he may have been just stringing me along.&nbsp; I hope he is ok and comes back quickly, but i am very doubtful and somehow have a feeling he is GONE! <br />If he has done a runner then i hope a plane drops out of the sky on his head. Don&#039;t care about the money, just for making me sit here for weeks thinking customs got my shit! :(

				Fuck!! I too have been a happy customer of Bazley&#039;s and have had many successful deliveries. Ordered something on the 7th whilst he was in stealth mode and it showed up as being in transit 2 days later but after reading this I&#039;m thinking it won&#039;t turn up. I just recommended him to a friend who placed his 1st order on Silk Road with Bazley. Any further updates appreciated. For some reason I cannot log into SR atm.

				Feel for you bro....sux 10 fold when you recommend a seemingly good vendor to a friend like I also did, then this happens and feels like ya in the middle of it. Don&#039;t think i will ever make that mistake again. A similar thing happening once before with a vendor i had recommended also to a friend and i should have learned back then... &quot;I can&#039;t vouch for anyone here&quot; even if their feedback is 100 &amp; their profile sounds like &quot;the bee&#039;s knee&#039;s&quot;! <br />Gee wiz, cant even trust my drug dealer these days LOL

				&quot;He was last seen today but that could be LE&quot;<br />Hmmm. So i got up at 8 this morning. said he was last seen today after a 9 day no show. Almost 7 at night now &amp; what, he hasn&#039;t had 2 minutes to apologize to us all in a quick profile update??? I&#039;ve had all day 2 do shit, accomplished much including sending some emails off. LE?? Wouldn&#039;t they have thrown up some listings as bait? Replied to some pissed off consumers emails, perhaps asking for addresses for reships?<br />Fuck if it was my business i would be ashamed for not even adding a 2 minute splutter of something at least just to say hey, &quot;My mom is crook&quot;, my pet snake died or my dealer got eaten by a Sasquatch&quot;. What could LE gain by having access to his/her account? So they get some names &amp; addresses to where some shit was sent. SO WHAT? What i would REALLY like to know (and only SR admin could tell us i suppose) is what he did online 9 days ago when he popped in for a day and then today? Empty coin from account ETC ETC. I&#039;ll eat my words if he surfaces FOR REAL but there&#039;s only one in my Jury and for the time being, the Jury is OUT!<br />EARTH TO BAZLEY Please respond dude &amp; don&#039;t leave us all hanging in despair pls
