				l waited 26 hours and have finally received my coins. I saw the post by DPR, but I was just wondering if anybody can confirm that they have sent money to thier SR account and received them in a timely manner since the update by DPR. Just want to make sure that I am not in for another 24hr+ wait before I add my monies... Thanks in advance for replies.<br />

				Thanks for the reply. Do you know if it was a problem with the tumbler as originally theorized or something else? Also, would you be so kind as to post a link to a forum that explains the tumbler and how it works? Is it necessary for me to transfer to wallet then another one and so on until eventually going to my SR account or does the tumbler do an adequate amount of covering my tracks? The only reason I am at all worried is because the method I use to acquire my BTC requires my real name/info. Thanks for the info.

Thanks for the info.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure exactly what was causing the problem but judging by the fact that Bitcoin were entering the tumbler and not leaving it I would imagine that the tumbler or its interface to the wallet system was indeed the problem. This has now been fixed and more problems are unlikely.<br /><br />You can read more about the tumbler in the Buyer&#039;s Guide here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Tumbler<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tumbler<br /><br />Just when you thought Silk Road couldn&#039;t be more secure, we went one step further. The tumbler sends all payments through a complex, semi-random series of dummy transactions, each with a new, one-use receiving address, making it nearly impossible to link your payment with any coins leaving the site. The quantity, frequency, and number of transactions are all varied chaotically in a way that mimics the transactions of the Bitcoin economy as a whole.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would highly recommend visiting the Buyer&#039;s Guide and reading through the other topics there too.<br /><br />It is advisable to obfuscate your Bitcoin&#039;s &#039;tracks&#039; as much as possible; the more security-conscious folk here generally run their Bitcoin through an external tumbler as well such as BitcoinFog or blockchain.info&#039;s anonymising service. These do charge a very small fee but it is important to note that you are trusting them not to abscond with your Bitcoin.<br /><br />The service at blockchain.info is generally seen as quite reliable and BitcoinFog has been operating for quite some time, but again, you are trusting both with your coins. Simply sending Bitcoin from one wallet to another, to another and so on so forth doesn&#039;t really do anything to obfuscate their origin. The SR tumbler employs a much more complex process and the mixing services I mentioned actually give you different coins back than the ones you send into them.<br /><br />In short, unless you&#039;re ultra security conscious or spending a relatively large amount then the SR tumbler should suit your needs just fine. :)<br /><br />Libertas
