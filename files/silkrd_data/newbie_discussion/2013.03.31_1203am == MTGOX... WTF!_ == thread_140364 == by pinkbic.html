				So, lets say you have had a MTGOX account for at least 8 months and you&#039;ve utilized it successfully in getting bitcoins into a different btc wallet.<br />Recently I went ahead and put money in my MTGOX account and now can&#039;t get my bitcoins out without verifying?<br />Any thoughts?<br />I got $1600 sitting in a MTGOX account&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				I have no problems with Mt. Gox. they have to play by the rules. Just be legit with your account and use a tumbler or a separate wallet as an intermediary.

				My guess is you accessed mtgox using tor or some other proxy. They will freeze your account when you do that. <br /><br />I stay away from mtgox and use services where I can buy coins with cash. <br /><br />Pinkbic , <br /><br />It is better to fog your coins before going to Sr wallet but don&#039;t worry about it. Sr tumbles coins for you before putting them into your wallet. So it isn&#039;t that big a deal. No one can tell what you purchased on Sr and since there are legal things to buy there the fact that you sent them into SR is not proof of anything illegal.

If they let you move coins but not cash out money ($, EUR, GBP etc..) I would trade back all the money you have into BTC and move it over to localbitcoins.com and cash out there. <br /><br />IF that fails, see if they will allow you to transfer the funds to another verified users MTGOX account, if they allow that I can create a listing for you and we can cash them out that way. I have a proper account, verified, with a daily limit of 10,000 and monthly limit of 50,000 and I´m friendly with their support team. <br /><br />If that fails, contact the seller Googleyed on SR, he can make you a driving license and probably forge you a utility bill no problem under the fake details you gave when you created your account<br /><br />ACE
