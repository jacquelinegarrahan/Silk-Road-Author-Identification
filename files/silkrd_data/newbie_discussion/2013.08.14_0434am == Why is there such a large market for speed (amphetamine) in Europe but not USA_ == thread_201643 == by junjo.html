				I&#039;ve noticed the shit tons of listings for ridiculously cheap speed coming from european countries, while there aren&#039;t any at all in the USA. Meth seems to be far more of a thing here, but also far more expensive. Can anybody explain this, considering they&#039;re nearly identical drugs?

				Methamphetamine&#039;s are roughly twice as strong as amphetamines which is one reason I think also most of the speed I have tried in the past from overseas is highly cut crap. Maybe I am wrong but Ive blown enough adderals to know that the stuff I have tried doesnt really compare to adderals let alone meth. Also speed is often sold as paste and when dried its weight is usually half. So really you dont get nearly as much speed as one would think and the shit usually isnt nearly as strong as one would expect. I could be wrong with recent vendors as it has been sometime since trying some. I asked myself this same question sometime back and this is the answer that I came up with.

				I think the market is there - but frankly, the shit you get here in the states is nowhere near the quality of what you&#039;d get from Europe. US based vendors on the road wouldn&#039;t do well, I don&#039;t think. <br /><br />I know the buyer market is here - I have friends that love the stuff. I&#039;ve never enjoyed amphetamines of any sort outside of MDMA, and even then I prefer MDA due to it&#039;s chill nature. <br /><br />Just my two-cents, though that&#039;s not all too helpful.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Americans haven&#039;t really been doing speed, or &quot;crank&quot;, since the 70&#039;s-80&#039;s. They have meth, which blows dirty amphets out of the water. Europeans do prefer meth over speed but it&#039;s pretty difficult to get outside of Eastern Europe, and expensive. Most of the meth they do get comes out of the old USSR states like Ukraine and Poland.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Meth in America is insanely cheap for the quality. Where I live (Australia) a gram of meth goes for $600-800 US.
