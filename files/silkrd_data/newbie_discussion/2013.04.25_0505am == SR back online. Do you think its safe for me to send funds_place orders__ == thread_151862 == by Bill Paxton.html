				Would you suggest going full speed ahead and placing orders that I have BTC in my account for?<br /><br />Also, was waiting for things to get back online so I could deposit even more BTC into my SR account and place (even more) orders ASAP...<br /><br />Should I wait 12 hours to make sure everything is still running ok or do you think its safe to proceed as usual?

				I think you&#039;ve got the green light here. It all depends on your situation, it sounds like you need to order quickly. If you&#039;ve got the time then wait it out, but if you really need to make your order I would go ahead and do so. I don&#039;t believe SR will be infiltrated anytime soon.

				I would say so. I&#039;ve been here for a while and this is by far the fastest I&#039;ve ever seen the site operate. You should be good to go.

				Cool thank you for responding.<br /><br />I went ahead and deposited more BTC via bitinstant so as soon as that shows up I&#039;ll be placing my order which will go out tomorrow.&nbsp; Because of SR being down, an order I placed Tuesday night did not ship out on Wednesday. I&#039;m hoping to get these two in tonight so that all three will go out tomorrow together (Its all the same product from the same trusted vender).<br /><br />LONG LIVE SILK ROAD!!!!

				I&#039;m fairly confident this was an attack with the motive of getting SR users to Atlantis. Either to profit for it&#039;s owner by fees or as a massive sting operation.

But then again the whole &quot;war&quot; on drugs has been a huge waste of resource. So you&#039;ll never know really..

				When you&#039;re dealing with felonies, you can never be too cautious. SR is amazing because we know it works. We know it&#039;s legit. We know it&#039;s clean. It is time tested and proven. I&#039;m not willing to risk my freedom for a cleaner UI. Sorry, just don&#039;t care enough to. Sure, the SR site feels dated but it&#039;s still getting schedule 3 narcotics to people&#039;s front doors in under 24 hours. Fuck Atlantis.
