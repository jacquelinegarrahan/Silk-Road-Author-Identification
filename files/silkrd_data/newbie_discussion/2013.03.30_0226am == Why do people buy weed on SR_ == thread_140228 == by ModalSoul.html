				I&#039;ve been curious about this since I joined SR a few months back. <br /><br />Is it really that hard to find decent quality bud where you live? Maybe I&#039;m just spoiled living in Michigan, but getting top shelf bud is a phone call and a 10 minute drive away at most. And around here it seems like the prices are better too, $10 a gram is the usual. <br /><br />Also I&#039;ve always thought if anything would get caught in the mail, it would be weed. That stuff smells!! Plus the packaging must be somewhat bulky. Anyways if anyone wants to tell me why, or what their experience has been having weed mailed to them, I&#039;d love to hear it. <br /><br />-modalsoul

				Not saying where, but I live in a country which is used to transport a LOT of drugs into the US coast states, some of those drugs, mainly coke, heroin are not bad quality and some of it does stay in the local market here. <br />Now weed is similar in this regard but it is brick/ditch/schwag weed, sometimes mids. Real quality weed can&#039;t be found imported, those that grow it personally though are hard to find.<br />But comparing weed from the road, to grower quality weed, the weed from the road is the shit, like weed from people like farmer1,&nbsp; anonymart and blueskiesredeyes.<br /><br />It really does depend where you&#039;re at. Because we&#039;re I&#039;m at, weed apparently isn&#039;t worth the trouble, at least not for high quality medical grade.

				I can get bud where I live but people around here sell shit nothing here is that great.&nbsp; Its all over the place and its better than nothing but overpriced for the product.&nbsp; SR seems a better way to get quality.&nbsp; I havent made a purchase yet but the selection is great.&nbsp;

				In my state where I live an ounce of shitty mids is 350$ min. The road has allowed me to start a large buisness and be successful. I have a deal with a certain vendor where I&#039;m buying pounds of A+ outdoor for 1800$.<br />I alone am changing the game in my state. I now support all the dealers. As uniwiz said, just because your lucky doesnt mean anyone else is.<br />Right now I&#039;m trying to work out a deal with bayareaBudz for his best weed in pounds. The road was life changing for me because of weed. I literally will make more money from selling weed locally than I can ever hope to on cocaine because of the huge inflated prices.

I for sure didn&#039;t mean to sound like I was looking down on you though, I was just curious. I buy acid on here because I can&#039;t get good acid locally. If I was in the same situation with bud I&#039;m sure I&#039;d do the same. I guess it just seems strange to me because of my location, which I&#039;m super lucky to be in, and because it seems riskier to me. But hey if the stealth wasn&#039;t tried and trusted I guess weed wouldn&#039;t be on the road. <br /><br />To answer your last question, I doubt every strain is readily available. But yeah, tinctures, oil, baked goods, etc., aren&#039;t that hard to come across IF you know the right people. I&#039;m sure non of my friends could get those things, but I happen to be good friends with one of the better dealers in town. <br /><br />We haven&#039;t always been this blessed though! All this top notch weed seemed to appear out of nowhere. My friend started out selling shitty regs to our group of friends just 4 years ago. &quot;Chronic&quot; started appearing towards the end of the first year but was treated (and priced) like gold when we had it. Gradually regs made their way out of the scene, and by the end of the second year they ceased to exist. Now he&#039;s pushing ounces of whatever his guy didn&#039;t sell to the dispensary and has access to all kinds of extracts. This is the effect of the medical community! And real progress is being made, the future is looking bright for the rest of America. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll start to see more and more medical states, and soon enough more legal states like Washington until eventually the federal government says fuck it and makes pot legal. And for those outside the US like yourself, maybe your government will take after our example. If not, there will still be hella bud flowing out of every state in America, which will probably mean a huge price drop for you! <br /><br />I hope with all my heart that affordable dank will someday soon be a treat the whole world can enjoy.<br /><br />&nbsp;/vyvanserant

This was my favorite response. I think it&#039;s pretty rad that you&#039;re changing up the whole scene in your state just by using the road. You must feel on top of the world. It&#039;s awesome too that with your sales you wouldn&#039;t even be tempted to push blow. Marijuana is the healer. Also I realize that not everyone is as lucky as me. At the time I posted this I didn&#039;t consider how the scene has only changed in my state and that other states are still where we were a few years ago. If I were a dealer in your position I would do the same thing. Congrats on the success and I hope there&#039;s much more in store for you.

And if it really is just as safe as ordering some mushies then I can see why you would do it.I&#039;m tempted to buy a gram of something that sticks out to see how it&#039;s shipped, and see the quality for myself ;) I could see myself getting some edibles like cheeba chews or something too.

				Where I Live the weed is rather pants, the growers only give a shit about unloading sub standard weed at every turn, it should be Illegal that people can only buy shit weed like this in todays society haha<br /><br />As crazy as it seems to me, that even in 2013 people can&#039;t always get access to good quality drugs. Its a shame, but Silk Road changes that for me. I can&#039;t wait to buy some high grade smoke, and get some Xanax. Some Opium Hash maybe too, the goods in market are extensive, I go to my dealer and I get the choice of Soap bar or third world weed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Either way their is risk,&nbsp; but I would say the majority of drug charges are because of people having dope in their cars. Then there is the exchange, which could be seen or monitored. And there is basically NONE chance of someone getting out of a cop finding drugs in ones possession.&nbsp; I can see a better chance getting away with denying a delivery.<br />&nbsp;I have had a good experience getting weed from SR. I can get it in my area, but it actually is cheaper and just a more exciting variety than I&#039;ve ever witnessed. Double vacuum opaque sealed and highly professional packaging. As long as the vendor takes appropriate measures, I think going through SR is safer than the street - to a low key extent.

				A few reasons I turned to SR...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Selection &amp; quality - the variety &amp; quality here is amazing compared to what I could get locally<br />2.&nbsp; Price - surprisingly the price for good dank bud is cheaper here than local<br />3.&nbsp; No more driving to pick up, eliminating that risk (there still is risk, just much lower IMO)<br />4.&nbsp; No more dry spells - if my usual vendor is dry, there&#039;s tons of others to turn to<br /><br />

				Because some countries are a long way from a supplier. Bud costs me usually around 3.5g for 50 euros, and thats a good deal from a friend, if I order from SR I can get good buds for sometimes less than half that. I also live in the countryside which has very few reputable dealers.<br />SR can deliver in less than a week for a much lower price, I wonder sometimes why more people don&#039;t order where I am.

				<br />When you buy off the streets, most dealers will say to you, &quot;This shit right here... this shit right here is DEAFFF&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What!? Death? I don&#039;t want to die!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Noo. Deaffff.. You smoke it and you go deaf!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />All joking aside, every dealer will tell you they have the dankest, purest, best, etc, etc. Truth is, most of them have no clue even as to the strain they are actually peddling. ANYTHING that even remotely looks purple will be called Purple Kush or Purple this, that and so on. <br /><br />If you really want quality and to know what you&#039;re getting, you&#039;ll have to source it yourself!

				The price vs quality ratio here is really good.&nbsp; If you live in a non-medical state, it can be hard to find high quality cannabis that you can make a good profit on as well.&nbsp; The stealth employed by the good vendors is enough to make the packaged averse to suspicion, and all the vendors I&#039;ve worked with have 3 day shipping.

				I personally get weed on SR is because of the wide variety of strains that are available.&nbsp; I just love the variety- meaning different crops, varying levels of quality etc.

				I bought it a couple times to try it for my first time. Would you believe I have had oxycodone, rohypnol, and even prescription meth pills (Desoxyn) recreationally before I ever tried cannabis? Because I was one of those rare persons who never knew anyone with it. <br /><br />I vaped JWH-018 as my first cannibinoid experience. <br /><br />Its also less of a risk to get it from here if your vendor knows what they are doing unless you live in Amsterdam or Los Angeles or something where a quick hand2hand with a trusted friend or relative is routine upon a social visit. And obviously Colorado and other localities where its now essentially worry-free for users (feds still give the growers worry .. sic semper tyrannis etc etc). <br /><br />I only use it medicinally for when I have bouts of nausea now because I found I didnt enjoy it for recreation. Yes, its expensive here, but keep in mind your getting it to your door all vacuum sealed and obfuscated and dont have to drive anywhere and transport it back. For the US, im sure it wont be long before it is at least no longer an arrest/seizure level offense to possess it, and eventually it will be sold in ABC stores and taxed and regulated when those in power who believe in legislating morality die off and those of sensible &quot;mind your own fucking business and dont use the government to harass me&quot; persuation get elected. Each election cycle now, at least 1 more state will at least decriminalize it. And remember, the feds in the US are not going to prosecute someone for a personal amount of cannabis, even if you imported it and ICE seized it -- they are broke as fuck to afford prosecuting anythng at this point. I watch a lot of C-SPAN and I cant remember the last time I saw a &quot;dope on the table&quot; press conference from the AG. <br /><br />So if you got a local connect, or live in a locale where the local police cant arrest or cite you for possession, great. But some of us are still waiting for that dawn of a new day :)

				Becasue weed in my area is 120 a 1/4 and 380-450 an OZ. the &quot;mid grade&quot; is what I bought in bricks during the late 60&#039;s early 70&#039;s. It is nice to know the bud I am purchasing has been reviewed as well as the seller. I have really enjoyed my time here. Until I can get OZ&#039;s for 250-350 IRL, I will be on SR.

I&#039;ve bought at upwards of $400 a zip of A+ quality herb but I&#039;m surprised at the prices you stated. What region of the country are you in?<br /><br />Also remember, the more rural you are the higher the prices. As you get closer to metropolitan areas the prices go down significantly as there is typically more competition between the street vendors.<br /><br />-CC

				Normally i don&#039;t even smoke weed because anything with even the slightest amount of indica in it destroys any enjoyment of being stoned at all for me, having smoked Thai exclusively throughout 87 when i first started to get involved in &#039;drugs&#039; and learning to love that energizing, get up and go feeling that motivated me to think and create when i toked on it.<br />I like my brain being stoned, not listening to my heartbeat thump and my breathing for a couple of hours. <br />I like to think and that&#039;s what a sativa high does.<br />I wouldn&#039;t have bought any weed at all from on here unless I&#039;d seen an offer of authentic Thai for sale.<br />It shits me that the entire nature of the marijuana experience has been dictated to the world by the economic rationalism of only having a three foot tall ceilinged barge in which to supply your coffee shops, hence the addition of indica to the vast majority of sativa strains.<br />I can understand people who&#039;ve tried coke and mdma and etc who like the heavy physiological effects of those types of drugs to be included in their marijuana experience, but I live somewhere where that sort of stuff is hidden in very discrete circles and i was never exposed to it so i learned that being stoned was a purely mental thing..<br />Now if the Aussie customs would just fuck up and let it get through, I&#039;d love to get to smoke it again!

				I get my weed off the road now adays.&nbsp; I don&#039;t live in/near a medical state.<br /><br />For starters, it&#039;s cheaper.&nbsp; At $270/ounce, I&#039;m spending about $300 total including the bitcoin fees, transfer rates, etc.&nbsp; An ounce in person costs me $340; it also runs the risk of being set up or caught as you have to venture out for it.<br /><br />That same $340 ounce is of good quality, but still does not compare to the quality of bud I can find on the road.&nbsp; Even the ounces that are $235 here on the road are of the same quality as my local $340 ounces.&nbsp; My new favourite cannabis vendor is selling at $270 and it is the best stuff I&#039;ve had my hands on in the United States.<br /><br />It&#039;s convenient.

				It&#039;s cheaper than street prices where I live. Also, I&#039;m scared as hell meeting someone for an exchange in public or a dealers place... because of tor, and pgp there is less fear and more security.
