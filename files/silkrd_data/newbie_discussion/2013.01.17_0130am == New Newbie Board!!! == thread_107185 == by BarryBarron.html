				It appears there is a new board!<br /><br />I for one fully support this measure to eliminate the spam on the boards. Even though I had just made several very well thought out posts, I accept being retroactively noobified.<br /><br />How many posts do I need before I am released into the wild?<br /><br />Also it would seem sensible to move the pgp club to this board, where it will be more useful, stickied alongside some key information for new members..<br />=======================================================================================<br /><br />EDIT<br />After some time to think about this new forum, in its current form I think it is a terrible fucking idea - for reasons which are far to numerous and obvious to go into.<br />If they admins actually want this to be a constructive place:<br />1 Other members need to have access to the newbie forum.<br />2 The 50 post requirement needs to be amended - there are some good suggestions in other threads - as this effectively makes it impossible for members who only want to post a review every now and again to do so. Forcing them to spam.spam.spam to be able to post a review in a place where it will be seen.<br />3 The moderators need to be given authority to proactively merge and lock threads in the newbie section. I understand completely why this isn&#039;t implemented in the other boards, and I agree, but to make this board more constructive it is a must.<br /><br /><br />If no changes are made, we are going to have spammy spamminess indefinitely. This will prove that this is not meant to be a constructive, useful place where newcomers to Silk Road (which not all of us are but that&#039;s a different story) can gain useful knowledge and best practice; but instead is a place of bullshit and nothingness.<br /><br />Welcome to the Void.<br />

				If this means we can&#039;t post anywhere else, I&#039;m against the idea. This isn&#039;t my first Silk Road forum account, once the password is lost the account is thrown away and I continue to remain anonymous. <br /><br />If I can&#039;t join in any discussions once I&#039;ve done that then I can&#039;t see my stay here being very long, I&#039;ll stick to the market itself and find somewhere else to chat.

				yeah i think it should be lowered to something like 20 posts. 50 is a bit much, some people who use SR for years possibly have fewer posts.<br /><br />something needed to be done about the same questions being asked over and over though... but i think improving the wiki + stickies should have been worked on first.

				Meh, owell... 20 posts would be nice... Like especially for people like me (however I am going a bit hard to get my post count up now) whom don&#039;t really post that much unless it&#039;s helping someone out or giving your honest feedback, or posting something with a bit of substance.....

				So the best way to solve the spam problem is to make a large portion of the community all spam our way alongside the spammers in order to escape the spam... sounds legit. <br />I&#039;m curious to see how this uber-spam board turns out...

				True that, but then that means that the vendors actually have to contribute to the forums aswell, and have an active presence here, which would help boost their sales anyways.... so.... It&#039;s probably a good thing in the long run.. Plus it&#039;d stop new scammer vendors from posting shit on the forums, they&#039;d be found out before they can eve post in normal Rumor mill... oh just read your post properly... vendor reviews... yes... well.... I guess that&#039;d stop the vendor from making like 50 accounts and posting that he/she is a mad cunt n got the best shit ever.

				After some time to think about this new forum, in its current form I think it is a terrible fucking idea - for reasons which are far to numerous and obvious to go into.<br />If they admins actually want this to be a constructive place:<br />1 Other members need to have access to the newbie forum.<br />2 The 50 post requirement needs to be amended - there are some good suggestions in other threads - as this effectively makes it impossible for members who only want to post a review every now and again to do so. Forcing them to spam.spam.spam to be able to post a review in a place where it will be seen.<br />3 The moderators need to be given authority to proactively merge and lock threads in the newbie section. I understand completely why this isn&#039;t implemented in the other boards, and I agree, but to make this board more constructive it is a must.<br /><br /><br />If no changes are made, we are going to have spammy spamminess indefinitely. This will prove that this is not meant to be a constructive, useful place where newcomers to Silk Road (which not all of us are but that&#039;s a different story) can gain useful knowledge and best practice; but instead is a place of bullshit and nothingness.<br /><br />Welcome to the Void.

				So far, this seems to be helping the spam.&nbsp; Most of the other forums I belong to have newb sections so I don&#039;t think this is any big deal.&nbsp; Some forums pen newbies up for a predetermined amount of time (15 minutes) others go by post count.&nbsp; Some forums (bitcointalk.org) allow new members to petition the admins for early access to the main boards.<br /><br />Sometimes we have to sacrifice a little for the greater good of the community.&nbsp; No complaints from me although I do wish there was a way to allow senior, non-vendor members to post here but I don&#039;t know how that would be accomplished.&nbsp; Astor, for example has expressed an interest in helping newbs but he is restricted from posting.&nbsp; Nightcrawler would probably stop by and help out as well.&nbsp; Those two members along with a host of others have knowledge to share and they seldom lose their tempers with newbs.<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; kudos to DPR, the mods &amp; admins for trying *something*, maybe this will solve the spam problem.&nbsp; Also, it&#039;s kind of nice that newbies can ask questions here without getting negged into the next universe.&nbsp; I have also noticed that most ppl are on their best behaviour here - that&#039;s a good thing too&nbsp; :)
