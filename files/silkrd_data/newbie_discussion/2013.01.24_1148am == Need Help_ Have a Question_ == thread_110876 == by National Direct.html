				Since a lot of the people here are new to SR I thought I should make a thread where anyone can ask questions that they may have about SR. I&#039;m a new vendor here, but I&#039;ve been a buyer for 6months, so I am well researched and can answer a lot of different questions. If I can&#039;t I&#039;m sure someone else can chime in and help out.<br /><br />No question is too stupid. Even the ones that are pretty fucking stupid can be posted here&nbsp; :D

				We&#039;ve been selling large volume orders lately and we&#039;re also opening a warehouse to ship domestically to our US customers. So we&#039;re expanding at a rate we are having trouble with, but in the end we&#039;ll have a nice line of products, most of which are legal in most States and Canada. At the moment I have 500mg of etizolam to encapsulate but im not sure how much ill have after that (I tend to spill that chemical the most... and it&#039;s expensive&nbsp; :&#039;( ) <br /><br />Current Products:<br /><br />-Phenazepam<br />-Etizolam (Early next week we&#039;ll restock)<br />-Kratom (just as free samples at the moment) 3 types: Borneo Red Vein, Maeng Da, and a Blended one with a mix of red and white stemmed leaves for an energetic feeling.)<br />-Prepaid MasterCards<br /><br />Future Offerings:<br /><br />Armodafinil: LATE - could come anytime<br /><br />Ethylphenidate (crystalline): May<br /><br />Tapentadol HCl: May.

Ever play the telephone game? Try adding translations to the mix, the mix turns to shit like the products they destroy in their supply chain.
