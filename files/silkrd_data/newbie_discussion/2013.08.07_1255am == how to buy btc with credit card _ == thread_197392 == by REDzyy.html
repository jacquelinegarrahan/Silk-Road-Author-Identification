				Dude, I&#039;d stick with them.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to wait a day or two for them to restock then go through the hassle of giving your personal identifying information to verify at another place. <br /><br />Btcquick is trusted. <br /><br />If they were out for a while, Id simply do a cash deposit at walmart

				It is never a good idea to link your personal information with your BTC purchases. While it is not illegal it is frowned upon generally and it is just best to disassociate yourself.

				Very few BTC vendors accept credit cards because of charge backs and the fact that bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It&#039;s too easy to scam that way.

				Some free advice:<br /><br />If you find a way to buy bitcoins with a credit card, Keep it to yourself.<br /><br />That&#039;s one thing that the feds will jump on in a heart beat.

				There&#039;s really no reason to buy bitcoins with a credit card because of the insane mark up and extra fees that come with it. I can only think of a few situations that would warrant a credit card, and the main one would be if you&#039;re broke and can&#039;t wait until your next paycheck or whatever. If that&#039;s the case, it&#039;s likely you have an unhealthy addiction and shouldn&#039;t be spending money you don&#039;t actually have. <br /><br />Anyway, lectures aside, virwox is the only other legit btc vendor I know that accepts credit cards. But be prepared to pay up the ass for it from the multiple currency conversions... I want to say you receive 3/4 of your initial deposit but I&#039;m not sure. You&#039;ll also have to factor in the 48 hour hold virwox puts on your first transaction for verification purposes. Although after your first couple transactions, the deposit is basically instant. Not worth it unless you have money to blow and need your bitcoins asap.

				You could go to localbitcoins.com and find someone that accepts western union and then use your card on westernunion.com if your in a hurry/pickle or something, just make sure people have good stats, they use escrow anyway its pretty quick and easy if you look around on there~
