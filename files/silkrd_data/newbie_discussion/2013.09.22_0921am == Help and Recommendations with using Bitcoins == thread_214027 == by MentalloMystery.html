				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m a new member of Silk Road and I was wondering if anyone could offer recommendations for using Bitcoins safely and effectively. I&#039;ve noticed that there are online wallet services, but I&#039;m worried that purchases could then be connected back to my bank account. <br /><br />Thanks in advance for any tips/help.<br />

				Hello,<br /><br />Take a read through the security forums, you&#039;ll find all the information you need :)<br /><br />You can also buy BTC anonymously using cash in a face to face meet using localbitcoins or bitcoin-otc. This is a much safer option in terms of anonymity/untraceability.<br /><br />This thread should be of use to you: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112029.msg765916#msg765916<br /><br />And don&#039;t forget, bitcoinfog is your friend :)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				purchasing BTC is not illegal- also using TOR and visiting SR is not illegal- what is illegal is shipping contraband through the post and possessing controlled substances- so the idea is to remove any links in the chain that would be incriminating- so personally i use an exchange&nbsp; ( its cheaper) but most i think use localbits which can be totally anonymous ( just my understanding) - and i recommend tumbling the coin before sending to SR - as mentioned bitfog seems to be the best method- but really the stealth of the vendor seems to be the acid test- if it is effective- no problem- if not youve got problems regardless of how your purchased BTC- so do you homework

				redisyellow is right. Tumbling BTC is a good idea. I use CampBX (unverified account registered with a burner email) and Localbitcoins.com (also unverified account with a burner email) to purchase BTC. I send money orders to CampBX every payday and use Localbitcoins.com when I&#039;m in a bind. Everyone&#039;s got their own method of tumbling, but what I do is just send BTC back and forth from those two wallets, getting a new wallet addy with each transaction. I also get a new SR BTC addy every time I send coin to my SR acct. I&#039;m sure (I know) there are better, more secure, less time consuming methods for tumbling. But if nothing else this practice makes me &quot;feel&quot; more secure. And don&#039;t forget that on top of whatever you do, SR tumbles the coins when you make a purchase. In none of these BTC buys is my real name or bank acct number ever used.<br /><br />By the way, CampBX has about the best exchange rate you can find, in my experience anyway.<br />

				I use CoinBase. It links to your bank account and you can buy bitcoins from your home. After a month, you can verify your information and buy bitcoins instantly.

Do not use your bank acct to by BTC.

				Buy them with cash.<br />Honestly, if you&#039;re gonna get caught, it seems to me that it will most likely be by postal security.
