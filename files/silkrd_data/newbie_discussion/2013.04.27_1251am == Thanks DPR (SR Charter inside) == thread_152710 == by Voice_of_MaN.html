				Since I&#039;ve yet to it 50 posts, I regret that I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to thank DPR and the rest of the SR team personally.<br /><br />But not merely for the charter (which is a reflection of my own personal views). More so because this site is fucking awesome. I can&#039;t even imagine how much time, dedication, and hard work it takes to keep a site like this both secure and functional.<br /><br />And seriously, an ebay style black market complete with feedback and escrow: fucking genius.<br /><br />DPR and all, I appreciate your efforts and want to thank you for making the last year and a half of my life fucking rock!<br /><br />How ever much income you earn from this site, you deserve 1000 times more.<br /><br />Thanks again from a grateful user.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say enough good things about you!

Anything is possible.<br />Not probable given the current state of the world order. Control=power. If we have domain over ourselves and our choices then we take the power away from those who wish to control us and our actions. <br /><br />I speak a lot about the younger generations, those that are in their early teens now, and the changing attitudes they are being exposed to and how that has the potential to move towards a freer world. It will probably not happen in my lifetime, there are still too many of the old class in power, but I have faith that one day it will happen. Until then all we can do is keep fighting the good fight, supporting those who adhere to the true principles of freedom, and teach those who will come after us to embrace the power they have over themselves.

				I can&#039;t thank him in the regular forums yet, but I have to say, you&#039;re incredible DPR!! Thank you so much for what you&#039;ve started here, for the tireless work and effort you put in. This uniquely free market you&#039;ve created is amazing to say the least. Every day I use the Silk Road, it continues to blow my mind. You&#039;re are a pioneer DPR, and you&#039;ve started a revolution! That&#039;s honestly what I feel like I&#039;m part of, and I&#039;ve barely dipped my toe into the boundless ocean that is the Silk Road.<br /><br />Thanks a billion!&nbsp; ;D
