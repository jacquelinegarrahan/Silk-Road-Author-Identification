				Long story short, Im good with fronting to this guy bcuz i usually get paid back on time, this week however hes been avoiding paying me after several people informed me he done made the money back. today he apparently tried to commit suicide and ended up in the hospital with his stomach pumped. a friend said his mom wants to get in touch with me about giving the money back, of course i havent met up with her yet. <br /><br />what could i possibly be charged with if it came to her calling the police and saying i was the one who fronted him the shit.<br /><br />hes hooked on crack and apparently he was using the profits off my fronts to pay for his habit, a friend said his mom is gonna send him to rehab<br /><br />i understand im probably gonna be cussed out by his mom upon meeting her for the owed money<br /><br />im avoiding the situation right now and i really only wanna talk to the dude and not his mom, but what could i be charged with, i googled and couldnt find anything.

				Walk away from the money and deny everything.<br /><br />Chalk it up as a life lesson: never lend anyone drugs.

				I don&#039;t see how you could be charged with anything, if he was to OD and die from drugs you supplied him then yes, but for him attempting harm on himself then there is basis for a charge against you.&nbsp;
