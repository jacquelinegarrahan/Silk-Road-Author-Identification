				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m posting under a new name because.. this is a bit embarrassing for me (and for my own security). My daughter is beautiful, vibrant, friendly, charming, intelligent and funny. She&#039;s the light of our life. Our = mine and my wife. She also has a real shitty hand dealt to her. She was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Literally, the day she was born. Was bittersweet. If you don&#039;t know what CF is, I don&#039;t blame you. Google it. It SUCKS. They said her life expectancy was somehwere in her late teens, and by then their will be drugs that might mitigate or even one day cure or make CF manageable. Yeah right. So last year when she started getting sicker, her doctors said she her lungs just can&#039;t fight the infections and lasting damage. And that she&#039;d need a double lung transplant. Yeah, you read that right. Eight years old, and she&#039;ll need both lungs transplanted. I remember that day my wife was quiet. Me? I went excused myself and went to the bathroom and for the first time in probably 15 years I cried. I just cried. But I decided we&#039;d beat this, and she&#039;d beat this.<br />If you even want to know what CF is.. what happens is mucus clogs the lungs, it makes breathing very difficult. The thick mucus also causes bacteria (or germs) to get stuck in the airways, causing inflammation (or swelling) and infections that lead to permanent lung damage.<br /><br />I feel like by now I&#039;m a doctor on this issue. My wife works for an optomterist and is an office manager and makes a decent living hourly. I used to work in automotive since high school, but because of some injuries I incurred fighting Bush &amp; Cheneys wars, I am not able to work as a mechanic. Savings are totally depleted and we&#039;ve asked out family for as much help as they can give. Today I made a decision that no matter how less of a man it makes me, I don&#039;t care. I&#039;ll beg. I&#039;ll put my pride aside and beg strangers for help. The first idea that came to my mind was actually turning to the SR forums. I&#039;ve occasionally gotten some painkillers here to help me copy with my disability. I told my wife and she thought that was a bad idea. Maybe it is. I don&#039;t know. I just don&#039;t know what else to do. I didn&#039;t want to post from my regular username here because it wouldn&#039;t be hard for LE to I guess narrow me down and I&#039;ve mentioned purchasing some weed and vicodin here before. Although at this point I dont think that even matters. She&#039;s on a waiting list, and she needs a double lung transplant. Even THAT isn&#039;t a gaurantee. And how much does that cost? Don&#039;t ask. Over $100,000!! Friends and family have been generous but we are still embarrisingly short. If my girl gets her surgery and makes it through, words won&#039;t describe our joy. If she makes it through and surgery and God forbid theres a complication.. and we lose her, then I will never forgive God. But, BUT - if my girl can&#039;t even make it to her surgery because we couldn&#039;t provide the financial means, then I failed her and I&#039;m sure I wont be too far behind her one way or the other. Even if I have to lose my pride and put my hand out before strangers.<br /><br />So I turn to you. If you think &quot;Oh well, theres lots of people who need charity, who need help, theres other more apropriate forums, this guy just wants sympathy..etc&quot;, that&#039;s fair enough. I don&#039;t blame you. It&#039;s not your problem. .it&#039;s mine. But I&#039;m at my wits end guys. If anyone of you could find it in your hearts to I dont know, help out/donate in any way you can. Every single little bit counts. I just don&#039;t want to lose my baby. Even typing this I had to go wash my face because I couldn&#039;t hold it back. But yeah.. I&#039;m asking you, as a stranger, for help.<br /><br />I remember on Easter we were watching some Easter Egg hunt thing on TV and my girl asked me &quot;Daddy, do you promise I&#039;ll be able to do easter egg hunt next year? Will I be better?&quot; and it was the most painful thing for me to hear. But I kept my cool and promised her yes, you will. Man, please God don&#039;t let that have been a lie.<br /><br />Mods - if this isn&#039;t the correct forum.. could you tell me which section this would go in? Please don&#039;t delete this. <br /><br />I created a blockchain wallet and put the wallet address in my signature. I hope somebod(ies) out there can relate, and help me out. Was not easy writing this.<br /><br />FYI - if anyone is able to contribute at all, I&#039;d like to thank you. If you PM me or something I just want to personally thank you. If you want to be anonymous then that&#039;s your right, and I thank you more then you could ever imagine.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />A father out of options

				Sorry, I only donate to trustworthy charitable organizations. It&#039;s simply too easy to scam people through &quot;charity&quot; these days. Sad and callous, but true.<br /><br />Have you been in touch with medical charities? Try going to the media. At least you could verify your identity and people would be more likely to trust you. In fact, why not reveal your true identity here, if you&#039;re not using the account to commit any crimes, why do you hide?<br /><br />I wish the best for yourself and your daughter, and I sympathize.<br /><br />Those of you with public healthcare, be grateful.

				Again, why not post your true identity? That way, we can verify that you&#039;re not a scammer, and if this account is not tied to illegal activity, what do you have to hide?<br /><br />I&#039;m just trying to help, as I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s skeptical. It&#039;s not your fault, but there are assholes out there that pose as charity cases and cannot verify their stories.

				Yes actually, we have. We&#039;re talking to COTA. (Childrenâ€™s Organ Transplant Association).. and they have said they do help people in our situation. It&#039;s a lot of back and forth email/phone, but fingers are crossed they will be able to come through in some way.<br /><br />White Out - well I do have a regular account, but the problem is I&#039;ve ordered several times over the past year. That is definetly illegal activity. And various vendors would have my personal info.. I know they&#039;re technically not supposed to save it, but I can&#039;t be so sure they don&#039;t. I am kind of paranoid because a local paper did run a small story on us a few months ago.. and I can&#039;t put our name out there.. just out of privacy reasons. Sending you a PM though. Thank you.

				Mikey, have you ever heard of a CF drug called Kalydeco (Ivacaftor)? It costs $300,000 a year... but you may get it for free if you qualify for an exemption. Inquire about it at your CF foundation, doctors, and whoever else you&#039;ve been in contact with regarding your daughter&#039;s condition.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get any kind of exemption, then this is a problem that I seriously believe only SR can solve. That&#039;s because at least one manufacturer in Asia is already making this drug for peanuts. Someone should be able to acquire it for you if that&#039;s the case.

				Baraka - Yes, I know all there is about the kalydeco option. Been following it/reading about it for quite a long while now. Aside from the fact that it&#039;s one of the most expensive medications in the world, theres a very, very fine line on how early a person with CF can start the protocol. I think the FDA approved it for patients as young as 6 years old, but our pulmonogist had said last year that she&#039;s prone to infections and not very strong regardless.. and it&#039;s risky. That&#039;s if one can even afford $300k a year in treatment. I had done some research on clearnet forums and there are some online pharmacies that claim to have access to it that are Chinese and even Canadian.. but if they&#039;re adulerated or developed by questionable pharmaceutical manufacturers it could prove fatal. But that ship has sailed anyways. She needs her transplant at this point. That&#039;s really all that can be done.

				Not that I&#039;m in a position to donate as I&#039;m still a student so don&#039;t have any money, but seems like this is life or death surgery so they can&#039;t deny you something like that even if you don&#039;t have the means beforehand. OK afterwards you eventually have to pay off and this can take a while but still. They can never refuse some such a surgery, right ? At least not where I live.<br />Like there was just something on the news several days ago (NOT USA) about a kid with a rare decease whoms medication costs +200.000 a month. The hospital is postponing any payment and the goverment is trying to work out something with the manufacturers to try to reduce the price of the medication. Not exactly the same, but still... <br /><br />I still wish you best of luck though !

				Nope just saying that at all. I am stating how crazy it is how the value of a life comes down to the almighty dollar. Looking at the practical side. <br /><br />Anyway u look at it it&#039;s a horrible situation. There are many many ways to get the money to do the operation. Hell even television commercials or contacting your local news would be a great way to get some ground swell of support. If it were me would I come to a forum for drugs to try and raise the kind of money u are talking about? No. I would look to other Chanel&#039;s local paper community meeting town all hell a letter to the president would be a better bet then the silk road forums. <br /><br />Feelin me now??? <br />

				Honestly, I would try indiegogo.&nbsp; People raised 600K for a school bus monitor who got made fun of by some kids.&nbsp; That took about a week to get over half a million... so I think you should give that a shot if you really want help.

				I have no kids so I cannot imagine that how you much feel. <br />I read in your opening post that you would never forgive God?<br />Why he gave you a daughter and now he is testing your faith by taking her away.<br />He is the all mighty and does as he pleases.<br /><br />This worldly life is not paradise. If I would be paradise than no bad thing would happen right.<br />So it is a test of faith. <br /><br />If you do believe in God. I and I mean the one and only true God that is worthy of worship.<br />Ask him sincerely as much as you can. And with out adding partners to him. So not in the name of Jesus or any thing. <br /><br />I wish you the best

Unless proved otherwise. <br />If the guy really cares for his child and has exhausted every other means for assistance, I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s such an issue to post on his real account. Smells like bullshit.<br />If you post suspicious charity cases on the internet, you should expect to be criticized. <br />

				Wow, thanks guys.. just wow.. <br />I already spoke to a few members via PM who can absolutely correlate that I&#039;m not a &#039;scam attempt&#039;. Im sorry if I came across that way?<br />Christ. Obviously, it&#039;s my fault. I&#039;m an idiot to expect people to have a heart on this place. Why should they? Me and my family are strangers who you&#039;ll never meet. Thanks anyways though.
