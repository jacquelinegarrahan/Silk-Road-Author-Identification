				Does anyone know a way to use paypal to buy bitcoins? I used Virwox&#039;s method but there were a lot of hoops to jump through and lots of fee&#039;s.

				<br />You can do it with Virwox. It is not the easiest way to do it. I have only done it once but it kind of goes like this. You use paypal to buy product A. You take product A and convert it to product B. You can then take product B and convert that into Bitcoins.<br /><br />It is a real pain and they charge fee&#039;s for every transaction but it is a way to get it done.<br /><br />I wonder why nobody takes paypal for Bitcoins? Any senior guys want to chime in?

				i have had terrible experiences with Paypal, I would avoid it at all costs. They DO NOT support the bitcoin movement in any way. I would recommend using LocalBTC.com&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I buy from this guy:<br />ï»¿<br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/22396/purchase-bitcoin-cash-deposit-chase-bank-united-states<br /><br />if there is a Chase bank around you, the process is pretty much instant.&nbsp; &nbsp;you request an amount, you make an anonymous cash deposit to the account, and your coins are delivered.&nbsp; LocalBTC will protect your rights as a buyer if there is foul play and there is an escrow system.<br /><br />You can also meet up in person with people, but the quickest way is the above method of bank cash deposit where you can get it done and over with without any trace it was you.<br /><br />best of luck to you

				Some people buy BTC on Ebay but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. I tried selling some LTC on there and I had scammers bidding left, right and center. Localbitcoins is your best bet, ideally find a seller who sells for cash. Leaves no paper trail to your bank account

				That&#039;s a great idea.&nbsp; I have a Chase Bank 2 blocks away from work.&nbsp; I&#039;m headed over to this INSTANT delivery site right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />You would say that delivery is pretty much instant once the money is deposited into the person&#039;s account?&nbsp; What are the fees like?&nbsp; Do I buy BTC at the current market value for that moment in time?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions.&nbsp; I&#039;m on COINBASE and on my 3rd day of waiting of 4 days before they deposit the btc into my wallet (that I bought on Monday!&nbsp; &gt;:( )

				Nobody will take paypal or debit/credit for bitcoins because they are reversible transactions. Paypal does not allow you to use there service for digital goods. You can report the funds as stolen and then the seller loses the coins and the money. Virwox is the only place i know of that accepts paypal or debit/credit and they charge very high fees.

				Almost no one would accept PayPal for BitCoins because many people will reverse the money after they receive the coin in order to get the money and the coin and the seller just loses out.
