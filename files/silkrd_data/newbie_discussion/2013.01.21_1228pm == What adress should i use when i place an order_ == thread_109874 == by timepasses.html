				Sending to a vacant house is an instant and obvious red flag. The postman knows what houses are unoccupied. <br /><br />If you rent where you live, and the vendor has good stealth, you can usually just have it sent directly to you. If you make up a name, that can result in the package getting flagged. <br /><br />The key is to not have it sent with a shipping method requiring a signature. Then if the postman asks for a signature, you know the stealth has been penetrated, and you just refuse to sign (and never have any contraband sent to your address ever again).<br /><br />If you own where you live, then you can have asset forfeiture risks, especially if you&#039;re ordering greater than personal use quantities. In that case, get a P.O. Box. <br /><br />If you get the box under a fake name, then you&#039;re adding mail fraud to your crimes, so that&#039;s probably a mistake. <br /><br />Finally, if you can&#039;t handle the possible worst case scenario, don&#039;t buy contraband in the mail.

				Most vendors dont like fake names and empty building addresses they would much more like you to seem as legit as possible. Usually mailmen know who lives at what address and if mail goes to an address occassionally.

				I&#039;m sure a lot of people on the road just get it ordered straight to their residence in their name. I would imagine that not everyone has the luxury of having someone they know that would agree to have drugs shipped to their house, let alone trust them enough to not steal it. If you can&#039;t get it ordered to a friend or family member, and aren&#039;t comfortable receiving it yourself, then don&#039;t order at all.

				Just use your home address or a mailbox. The danger lies in the mail system - that&#039;s how you could be found out. And whatever address you choose to give will then be flagged and unusable. I find that as long as I avoid buying easily discoverable stuff (pot, meth, etc), I have little to worry about.

				I just use my real name and address. I usually only buy like an OZ of weed at most, so if someone does catch it they probably won&#039;t do a controlled delivery, more likely they&#039;ll just burn it and I won&#039;t get my weed.

				Thanks for the info, I had been using a previous occupants address (who gets about one letter a week) but suddenly getting parcels might be suspicious. They&#039;re uk domestic, personal use deliveries.<br /><br />Considering using my real name. Unless there is a particular advantage in not giving the vendor my real name? (should they get busted etc?).<br /><br />Alternatively might just start a new name at this address and occasionally post non parcel things.

				I&#039;ve been talking to one of the very high ranked members on here and he advised me to put your actual name and address. I know it&#039;s pretty nerve wracking but he said that if there&#039;s a shipping problem, it&#039;s the best way to get a refund, get a resend, and to make sure it actually gets to YOU. If you get caught just deny it non stop. My plan when I order and I think would work well for everyone is when I get my package, just in case for some reason I get found out and they are going to pull a CD on me, once the package arrives I&#039;m going to leave it closed for probably a day or 2 because if they&#039;re going to try and bust me I have a lot better of a chance of getting away with it if not only the drugs aren&#039;t in my hands but especially if it&#039;s still completely closed. I will simply say &quot;I have no idea what this package is or why I received it. I was trying to decide whether to open it and see what it contains or just send it back.&quot; I feel that would be the safest option since they technically can&#039;t get you with possession if it&#039;s closed and has been for hours/ days and you claim to not even know what&#039;s in it. Just my opinion. If the time comes, I hope this helps you. Just be smart!

				Actually, I&#039;ve done my research on the forum and even several vendors suggesting SR buyers use burner addresses. <br /><br />My question is, what do they mean exactly by burner addresses? Is it a drop at location that you don&#039;t reside or registered? <br /><br />Also as a precaution, if for instance your package gets seized by customs, would it be safe to have other orders shipped to the address, but with a different name?<br /><br />For me, I&#039;ve used my current residence before, but I&#039;m just a subtenant among many roommates. So we get a lot of mail, thus in my case it doesn&#039;t look as suspicious. Also, I don&#039;t ever use my real name (even if my address is PGP encrypted), I either use previous tenants&#039; names and often misspelling them.

I guess we can hope that those taking great care with their packaging are also taking similar levels of care with data handling.

				WOW!&nbsp; There&#039;s some dumb shit repeated here!&nbsp; For starters; don&#039;t put much weight on 90% of the posts here since most are n00bies.&nbsp; If there are over 100 posts to their name then maybe there could be some wisdom!&nbsp; (Nomad, Glass House etc.)&nbsp; There is mostly opinions being tossed around here while trying to get up a post count, so consider the source if there are less than 50 posts from poster.<br /><br />If living in US, DO NOT USE FORMER RESIDENT&#039;S NAME!&nbsp; You may get trash mail from former resident, or even regular mail.&nbsp; If you are getting regular mail, they haven&#039;t put in for a change of address yet, &amp; you never know when they will!&nbsp; If you are still getting garbage mail from the former resident, they have put in for the transfer, but it doesn&#039;t pertain to 2nd or 3rd class mail, &amp; that will continue for a while.&nbsp; But packages sent from SR are almost always 1rst class, &amp; will not even get to the house to be delivered.<br /><br />Vendors who are very sucessful here on the Road ALL recommend using the same name &amp; address that you use for ALL your personal bills . . .&nbsp; You will always get your package (99.7%) unless something really crazy happens.&nbsp; Your bills always seem to reach you!<br /><br />Please don&#039;t be giving opinions when you don&#039;t have the experience from the vendor&#039;s side!&nbsp; We have probably sent out&nbsp; 2000 - 4000 times more packages than most of you have received within a month here on SR, yet you guys are telling everybody what it&#039;s all about!&nbsp; REALLY!!!<br /><br />NCK<br />

				@ NCK<br /><br />CHILL! This is what happens when you throw a bunch of newbs in one basket! what did you expect? Plus, you are speaking from a vendor&#039;s point of view. There are no PO boxes in most of the world except the US. And using previous tenants aren&#039;t risky if you are still constantly getting their mail almost everyday and/or they just moved out. If you live in a residence that has tenants constantly moving in-and-out ..I don&#039;t see the problem using a fake name or using a previous tenants name. Heck, if it is so bad, why does SR even enforce the policy to use burner addresses and fake names? (and by fake names I don&#039;t mean stupid shit like John Smith or Jane Doe...no duh that will definitely be a red flag). If anything goes down, I&#039;d rather the LE or the vendors don&#039;t know my true name and identity. Like others have mentioned, what if vendors don&#039;t erase their addys, you can never be too cautious.

				from doing this before i used to send fuck head, douche bag, cock sucker on the address to my brother. It still got delivered the postman is on autopilot just reading the address. But after doing so so&nbsp; many times he started getting pissed and would return to sender..... so yes use a fake name. if getting delivered by the usps they still deliver to the address its the companys fault if they put the wrong name on it...&nbsp; They just deliver to that address... hope that helps you out

				I have been ultra paranoid and have been researching all of the things involved with this process to the best of my ability.<br /><br />My thoughts and I&#039;m in North America.<br />If your a yank or a canuck, use your real address with your real name. <br />I do like the idea of maybe throwing an initial in or something to distinguish from regular mail...<br /><br />If your buying drugs on the street even someone to know, I&#039;d wager that the risk of being caught at the premise/picking up or driving away is higher than receiving a personal package in your mail.<br /><br />Would I buy large quantities? no. To me thats more of a playing with fire risk.

				I have things sent multiple places but the main thing I try to do is to never have illegal packages distinguishable from non illegal ones. For example don&#039;t only have illegal packages sent to a PO box or use a different name for them than the normal mail, it just increases the risk of profiling.
