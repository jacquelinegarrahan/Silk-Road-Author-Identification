				Most of you probally know this but i wanted to warn all newbies to never FE, sounds obvious but new vendors will pop up with really good prices, some will order and they will ask you to FE, saying something like cash flow is low, or they cant afford to have 1000&#039;s tied up in escrow. What will then happen if you FE is that THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY. No matter how good this new vendors prices seem, NEVER,EVER FE FOR ANY REASON.

				How are new buyers supposed to circumvent this when many of the reputable sellers require FE if you have under a certain number of completed transactions? If you are buying a small amount from a seller with a near 100% rating who requires FE, I do not see the problem. I have only made a few transactions on SR, all of which required FE because I had under 5 completed. All of my orders came through without a hitch.

Most SR people are happy to help out a newbie, if the newbie can show he has done as much as possible from the above.

				There are plenty of vendors willing to accept orders from newcomers without FE, just take the time to look vigorously. I just recently received my very first order without FE and all was perfect and just as advertised&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Be smart and don&#039;t rush into it without properly researching. The game can be rough if you don&#039;t protect yourself-- that&#039;s essentially why the escrow system is in place, because it works...&nbsp; I&#039;m no expert by any means, but it has worked for me.

				I understand the apprehension against FE from some people, especially if you&#039;ve been scammed, but it seems logical from the perspective of a credible seller. Anyone can take a couple of minutes to make an SR account, order some drugs, and then just claim they never got their package. The scamming buyer has nothing to lose. They can just make a new account and order from different vendors later on. A seller has a reputation to keep, which can be harmed by scammers who claim to not receive product, and they have made an investment in their account and rep. It makes sense that they don&#039;t want some jerk off kids to get on and get a couple of free bags at the expense of their product and reputation. <br /><br />It might be better if sellers set a maximum dollar amount for buyers who had under a certain number of completed transactions, but it is still understandably risky for smaller vendors who can&#039;t just absorb the losses.

				If you have less then 10 transactions then buy from 10 different vendors not requiring FE!!<br /><br />What&#039;s better....getting scammed because you FE&#039;d or trying out 10 vendors or 10 small quantities of stuff because you needed to get your stats up?<br /><br />You&#039;ll do better on the road in the long run if you make a lot of good purchases from excellent vendors anyway. And even then don&#039;t FE for them if they start asking for it. They could be &quot;cashing out&quot;

But then I read this post and found the reason I feel so secure is that all my packages are tracked and I can prove that they reach their destination. Honestly, I&#039;m not sure why all vendors don&#039;t use tracking. If not having to FE makes the customers feel more secure and knowing where your packages are as a vendor makes you feel more secure what is the damn hold up on getting tracking?! I would have to stick with most of you and tell you not to FE. If vendors want your business they will get their shit in order and secure their packs on their end by setting up tracking and quit making their buyers assume all risk!

Just because a package is tracked does not mean you have to sign for it. It is tracked to your mailbox and then you receive it with all your other mail. No signature required. The vendor is protected because he knows that it was delivered (at least to your address) and vendors should rest assured enough that they can prove that if there was a dispute that we should not be asking buyers to FE. I think the biggest problem vendors should be worried about is that newbs often time want to use a fake name and get things delivered to their homes. When this happens the postal service recognizes that mail going to this home doesn&#039;t usually have anyone going by that name receiving mail and they in turn do not deliver it. Vendors should be educating their buyers about using their true names and the subject of &quot;plausible deniability&quot;. Either that or don&#039;t sell to newbs and leave that market to me and vendors like me&nbsp; ;)

				TBH, I&#039;ve FE&#039;d twice so far and had no problem. Which is not to say that the above advice is incorrect. My biggest mistake has been to finalize as soon as receiving the product, rather than waiting until i&#039;d tried it out first. This has lead to me being stuck with produce which is below par, so be careful to use all your entitlements before Finalizing.

				@PureFire bro you&#039;re dealing with the wrong suppliers.&nbsp; The top suppliers here don&#039;t call the cops on you for not FE&#039;ing.&nbsp; They might black list you for disregarding their specific guidelines but they&#039;re not going to involve LE.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best thing you can do if your new is do tons of research.&nbsp; Find out who the reliable vendors are.&nbsp; Be patient and order from them when the opportunity is right.&nbsp; Then start out small. Order the smallest amount they offer and work up from there.&nbsp; You&#039;re building relationships.&nbsp; If something goes wrong then you&#039;re out less than $100.&nbsp; Cut your losses, learn from the mistake and move on. If you cant afford that then you&#039;re in the wrong space.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t amazon.&nbsp; When you start out the vultures are all after your money so just keep that in mind.&nbsp; You&#039;ve got lots to learn.&nbsp; First you have to learn security.&nbsp; Most newbies skip this part... Then you need to learn how to safely get BTC, then how to select a supplier, and then you have to master the receiving contraband.&nbsp; If you&#039;re new start small and work your way up from there.&nbsp; I made the mistake of diving in head first because I was trying to meet demand.&nbsp; Suffice to say I got burned buying BTC (twice).&nbsp; You wise up after losing $$$.&nbsp; Take your time and do it right the first time.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I never FE&#039;d first dozen transactions, then got lured by cheap gear, fucker even chatted back &amp; forth for good 10 messages or so to build trust. FE&#039;d, instantly got F&#039;d in the A. If you feel u absolutely have to so u can get some gear ,Start with small orders , 1/2g, especially international so u can see if vendors stealth is up for ur country&#039;s customs. After u and vendor done couple small deals, they got no need to ask FE.<br />Always start small with new vendor - newbie or not - scammin fucks all over this joint. Find a few good vendors to keep ur stocks up, Never fuck them over - if something wrong always give them a chance to rectify, everyone fucks up occasionally, and despite scammers, there are a lot of good vendors on here who will do right by you if you do right by them, I imagine it&#039;s what the whole concept of this place was conceived on.<br />Been on here about 4 months, 18 transactions, 9000 spent, 0 refund, 9 auto finalize, 1 scammin fuckhead, lost $300. Pretty fucken good outcome really, just gotta weed those scammin fucks out by being careful and starting small&nbsp; 8)

				I think the starting small before placing larger orders is sound advice too. Even vendors who are normally legit will possibly look at newbies as easy targets, especially if you start by ordering large amounts.<br />BTW, I know that feedback can be edited, but can you also change the number rating that you gave the vendor?

				When I first showed up here, I had to FE a couple purchases but was extremely pleased and satisfied in their arrival. <br /><br />However, No longer will I FE. Been reading too much about people getting scammed. Hoping that vendors are understanding on both ends of the spectrum as a buyer and seller. <br /><br />Honesty is the only thing that&#039;ll keep SR running smoothly.

				You don&#039;t have to FE as a first time buyer. You just have to look around, look local, and buy small to start with.<br /><br />I might just might FE for a 100% rated vendor from overseas on a great deal, WhiteShark is likely, but that&#039;s about it.

You would be amazed at the number of newbies and old hands who do not use this very powerful search tool. You need to get to the board of interest first (it can&#039;t search the whole site) and then it will pick out any matching letters so you need to learn how to narrow your search down. But it is all explained in the Help manual.<br /><br />2) Check your potential vendor&#039;s shipping options, some have a &quot;tracked&quot; option, and so they will know if your package gets seized by customs or delivered. It is more expensive, but vendors do not ask for FE when this option is used. Remember, they are worried about getting scammed by YOU!<br /><br />3) Try and build some sort of correspondence based relationship with them.<br />Always be polite and courteous, but not too nosy. Ask about the product, where does it come from, how long has vendor been involved with selling product on SR.<br />BUT do make sure these questions are not in the vendor&#039;s terms and conditions (T+C&#039;s) otherwise he/she will get pissed off and won&#039;t answer you.<br /><br />4) Finally, if you are still not sure, ask a question on here. Most SR people are happy to help out a newbie, if the newbie can show he has done as much as possible from the above. No old timer will give you the time of day let alone an in depth answer to your question if it looks as though you have made no effort to find the answer yourself.<br />&nbsp;This is why they introduced the 50 posts rule for newbies :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I was reading this thread I was thinking to myself &quot;Why would any vendor ask someone to FE if they weren&#039;t going to scam them&quot;. I am a fairly new vendor and couldn&#039;t imagine what the hurry would be and don&#039;t see the risk in being scammed by a buyer. But then I read this post and found the reason I feel so secure is that all my packages are tracked and I can prove that they reach their destination. Honestly, I&#039;m not sure why all vendors don&#039;t use tracking. If not having to FE makes the customers feel more secure and knowing where your packages are as a vendor makes you feel more secure what is the damn hold up on getting tracking?! I would have to stick with most of you and tell you not to FE. If vendors want your business they will get their shit in order and secure their packs on their end by setting up tracking and quit making their buyers assume all risk!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />YES, this is the intelligent answer, but the truth is coupled with economics, it just costs more to track a package. And it varies from country to country. <br />But there is some good news, India, Thailand and a few others have a cheap registered option, and in the UK we have proof of postage and recorded delivery.<br />So things are changing, and I can envisage a time when the old FE argument will not work any longer.<br />Bottom line is usually greed though.
