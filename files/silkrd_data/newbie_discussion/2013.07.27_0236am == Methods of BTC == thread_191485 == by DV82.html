				So Im not exactly a newbie and I have done a lot of research so far.&nbsp; I have used bitinstant before and it had failed (recently when it was shutting down).&nbsp; Now I have access to online banking.&nbsp; Besides using dwolla and having to wait those 3 or 4 days, whats the most easiest method for obtaining just less than .5 btc?<br /><br />Have checked out bitinstant (ehhh) mtgox (dont like it) and a few others (dont trust) but now everyone is mentioning localbitcoins.&nbsp; How can I use that site to do a wire transaction some how some way and obtain what I would like to receive?

				go to localbitcoins.com and register there.&nbsp; next click on buy bitcoins.&nbsp; from there you will a couple different options.&nbsp; you can buy bitcoins online and there will be a list of all online merchants offering btc for the currency you are paying with.&nbsp; next to the merchants name will be their limits (how much or little you can buy at once) so just look for one that is in your range.&nbsp; next to the limits will be what kind of payment they accept so you would be looking for someone who will accept wire transfers/bank transfers.&nbsp; Vendors there accept all kinds of payment, some accept okpay, some accept cash deposits in several different banks, paypal, moneygram, and western union.&nbsp; sometimes you can use a credit or debit card through moneygram or paypal and never have to leave the house.&nbsp; Another option is to buy them locally from localbitcoins.com which usually means you&#039;ll contact the merchant and set up a time to meet and make the transaction.&nbsp; Hope that helped!

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods (including localbitcoins) for buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
