				I never post in the forums but today i had too because around a month ago i bought this listing http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/89e611f021 from vendor &quot;sniffsniff&quot; and its a bunch of hacking programs i then downloaded it and ran a few programs to see how they work i notice my antivirus kept going off but he assured me its because of the hacking programs and that the AV does not get along with programs that create viruses so i pretty much wasted my money because the programs were old and really not working but soon after running some of them programs i started noticing my mouse doing weird thing like move by itself one time my camera light popped on. I was not thinking much of it and continued using SR and logging in and soon after i bought something &quot;typed in my pin&quot; and had 5.4 btc remaining logged out and when i logged back in the next day BAM&nbsp; my account was cleaned out 0.00 btc i was very pissed but still did not come here and tell the people what i thought was going on in case i was wrong but now after reading how fucking EASY it is to get a RAT (Remote admin program) build a virus and make it fully undetected&nbsp; from most antiviruses and bind it with any .exe file i then KNEW vendor sniffsniff hacked me. Then i started seeing other listings from him selling how to infect ppl with a pdf file and alots of different ways and also was reading in other parts of the forums other people getting there account accessed and btc stolen i will bet that they bought something from sniffsniff. his items are only $2.50 for most for most of them and he get lots of sales so he is pretty much getting paid to put backdoor Trojans on people computer and then getting paid more after you run one of the programs and catches his virus so that he have total control of your computer without you even having a clue then he key log and spy on you until he gets your sr pin and password and steals all your coins. Sorry i didnt say anything sooner to people but now is better than never.&nbsp; DO NOT LET THIS CONTINUE here is a similar thread&nbsp; someone getting there accounts hacked<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195124.0<br /><br />&nbsp;Ive seen a few others but cant find them right now<br /><br /><br />This is my first post i couldnt get this into the silk road security or discussion thread because i did not have 50 post but hopefully someone can copy paste my post in that part of the forum to let people know &quot;that dont come to the noobie thread. So bottom line if you bought anything from sniffsniff immediately go to a different pc than what you ran his programs on and log into your sr account and change password and pin. and do a system restart on your old to fully get his virus off.

				You should&#039;ve used a VM, obviously when buying keyloggers and a whole bunch of other spyware you risk getting your info stolen, but yeah I&#039;ve also suspected him of infecting computers (through his PDFs or other listings) of people that didn&#039;t use proper security measures but since he mostly had 5/5 and nobody really seemed to complain then I thought he may actually be legit. As a general rule, don&#039;t download any PDF or software from SR ever. He has a free listing for some PDFs so maybe it&#039;s just a way to steal more people&#039;s bitcoins and info. He even turned on your webcam so he could see your face when you realized you had over $540 stolen &gt;:(<br /><br />You should : change your feedback from 3 to 1 and make a long negative feedback that will attract people attention, report the vendor, contact SR support and tell them what happened, they may then put an end to this (but won&#039;t refund you).
