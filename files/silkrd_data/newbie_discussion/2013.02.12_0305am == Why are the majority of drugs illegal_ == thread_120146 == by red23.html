Completely different social mindset and structure. There are also plenty of addicts in the Netherlands and they have very strict laws against drugs except in personal use situations. The belief that they are lenient on drugs because they have hash bars is not a true reflection on the society.<br /><br />Drugs, whether it is alcohol, pain medication, or stimulants has consistently been an issue in America on a much larger scale than compared to other countries (probably with the exception of opium in china). While some drugs may have been made illegal due to overreactions by the government I don&#039;t think they are illegal because the government wants to control the alcohol supply or keep more people in prison. It&#039;s the general concern about public health and safety that keep them all illegal however hypocritical that may be in some cases.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a strong argument that because alcohol and some prescription drugs are legal/controlled and have public health and safety consequences that other drugs should be decriminalized. The people you mention in the crimes above, would you prefer that they were on meth, crack, or heroin?<br /><br />The reason alcohol is legal is not because it is not a public health and safety risk, it&#039;s because the government would have no chance of banning alcohol so it accepts the risks that come along with allowing it.<br /><br />To understand the reason different drugs are illegal, you need to study each drug individually as they have different effects and different risk profiles.

				They are Illegal to control the masses<br />1 Pot made illegal because the mexicans used it back in the day working in the fields and whites in power needed to have reasons for arresting and even sometimes killing those crazy mexicans. <br />2 Coke was made illegal because back in the day it caused black men to have super strength and lust over white women and you know whitey cant be haven no untamed negro<br />3 LSD and most other drugs was because of the hippies in the 60s and 70s the government cant have the draft dodging&nbsp; dirty bums making a seen and fucking in public<br />I know this sounds crazy and made up but it is very much true those are the reasons. I wish I could remember documentary&#039;s that have the history they are a good lesson into the thinking of our great and all powerful over lord government. The sad part is the sheeple are just handing over the rights that our forefathers had set in writing for us. Slowly but surly we are losing are way of life. You know it is not new first the moonshine then the drugs now its the food guns privacy you name it we are losing it.

				* &quot;Because most people are too stupid to use them safely&quot;<br />I say. SOME people are too stupid to use them safely, not MOST... but they will use any incidents as a justification for their laws<br /><br />* &quot;It&#039;s mostly about: 1. Public health 2. Public safety&quot;<br />that&#039;s what they tell us, but in fact, what they want is : they want us to FUNCTION in a &quot;productive&quot; environment. What&#039;s &quot;productive&quot; ? .. Only GS and JPM will know ;)<br /><br />* &quot;To keep private jails full?&quot;<br />Perhaps in the US a system running crazy on auto pilot, when i hear it&#039;s 900k people in jail i just beat my own head, it&#039;s insane!! And the thought enters, are they perhaps political prisoners in some way? But isn&#039;t there free speech in the US, too?<br /><br />When it comes to psychedelics there&#039;s also an important point: They just don&#039;t&nbsp; fit into our educational system. They have the potential to make us believe we are not just our body, and all it&#039;s implications!... Would be a grave danger for a system that relies on a mostly materialistic belief system of it&#039;s &quot;cattle&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				Very surprised to see people saying things like &quot;Public Health/Safety&quot; on this thread.&nbsp; If that were true, alcohol/tobacco/addictive Rx drugs wouldn&#039;t be legal.<br /><br />The only answer that ever made sense to me was that it was because, generally speaking, the &quot;right&quot; people aren&#039;t banking on the drug trade.&nbsp; Big business missed the boat on cannabis/cocaine/etc. back in the day, which is why unbelievably rich and powerful people like William Randolph Hearst fought so hard to demonize &quot;marihuana&quot; and other drugs.<br /><br />Wanna know what the number one lobby is in DC that fights to keep cannabis illegal?&nbsp; The alcohol industry.&nbsp; They don&#039;t want the competition.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I believe it&#039;s illegal in the US anyways.&nbsp; I can&#039;t really answer for the rest of the world, but I would imagine similar explanations would suffice (unless we&#039;re talking about countries run by a theocracy, in which case religion is the obvious culprit).

				I just don&#039;t believe most of the conspiracy theories about drug prohibition. I think the subject is pretty simple really. Drugs were made illegal because it was believed (rightly or wrongly) that they decrease peoples productivity. Clearly the primary purpose of drug laws is not to protect health since as others have pointed out many prescription drugs cause more harm than the illegal ones. Tobacco remained legal because it does not cause any noticeable short term intoxication and therefore does not effect ones usefulness as a worker. The drug warriors see illegal drugs as a kind of pollution that decreases the productivity of the working class and damages the economy. Today in the US many jobs drug test employees for reasons having nothing to do with safety , but rather because it is believed that a person who uses drugs (even on their own time) is less useful as a worker.

				drug prohibition is anything but simple. <br />and bollocks does smoking tobacco not reduce productivity. i&#039;ve worked in a place being one of the only non smokers and they get all aggressive and shit when they can&#039;t smoke and don&#039;t concentrate as well but it&#039;s the attitude which harms morale and when they take copious smoke breaks and the non smokers have to pick up their slack when they&#039;re not around. <br />that&#039;s not an attack on smokers, i used to be one, more my old boss who wouldn&#039;t allow me a 5 min breather when shit got tough and made me work 14 hour shifts with no breaks whatsoever, not even to eat but the smokers just wandered out whenever they felt like it. he was a right fucking wanker. and a smoker.

				I think that a majority of drugs were made illegal for various reasons all over the world at different times . Often times it was linked to some social movement, etc and their reasoning at the time was horrid. I&#039;m wondering if a more productive reason would be, &quot;Why are they still illegal?&quot; <br /><br />There will be many answers based on the substance and with very many justifications. Once we know what they are it&#039;s easier to kick the supports out from under them. Of course, the easiest way to go about this would be to have a vast amount of money and political clout and campaign for decriminalization, but I&#039;m going to assume that at least I will not have that kind of power.

				there definitely are addicts in the netherlands, the junkies tend to hang around the red light district in dam stealing and selling bikes and fake coke but the police give them 24hr bans from the city centre and such. the laws over there have a huge distinction between hard and soft drugs. the number of cannabis users over there is one of the lowest in europe i think. they have quite effective harm reduction policies for the hard drug addicts afaik.
