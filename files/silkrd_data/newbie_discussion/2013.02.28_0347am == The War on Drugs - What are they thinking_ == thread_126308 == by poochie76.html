				Please excuse the following rant, it&#039;s just a few of my thoughts regarding the war on drugs and why I just don&#039;t understand that it&#039;s happening.&nbsp; I&#039;d be lying if I said this wasn&#039;t an attempt at reaching the magical 50 posts, though at least I&#039;m doing it with intelligent discussion rather then limitless spam.&nbsp; Feel free to post your thoughts and join the discussion :)<br /><br />Now I think it&#039;s pretty clear that in terms of a pro-drugs bias, the SR forum has got to be one of the leaders; I don&#039;t predict that any support will be lacking.&nbsp; But I am asking a genuine question here: what are they thinking?<br /><br />Today I saw that Australia LE have seized the largest ever ice importation in the county&#039;s history.&nbsp; They found the truly ridiculous amount of meth hidden within a chemical shipment from China after reviving an anonymous tip-off.&nbsp; By the police&#039;s own admission the 585kg seizure was only possible thanks to the informant.&nbsp; A proud police officer told his story about pulling almost half a billion dollars worth of drugs off the street thanks to an honest member of the community.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some more information on the Aussie ice bust (CLEAR-NET WARNING ETC):<br />http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/record-ice-bust-585-kilograms-seized-in-sydney-after-tipoff-20130228-2f74s.html<br /><br />Now personally, I think that meth is a bad drug.&nbsp; I&#039;m well aware of it&#039;s incredible high but I will never touch it purely for it&#039;s incredible addiction potential and terrible side effects.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to stick with good old Mary-Jane, psychedelics and unadulterated MDMA.&nbsp; That being said, I firmly believe that if you or anyone else wants to take ice, they are going to whether or not it&#039;s a good idea and regardless of the approval of the government.&nbsp; That ignorant police officer thinks he&#039;s done this great favor for the people of Australia but what has he really done?<br /><br />Well for starters there&#039;s the economics.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a fancy degree to understand that when you reduce supply without reducing demand, all you&#039;re doing is raising prices.&nbsp; After all, some Australians, just like many others across the world, want to take ice.&nbsp; Even worse, plenty of people have serious addictions to meth. All of us here know that the cops can seize 5 tons of meth and Australians are going to keep using it.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to find it&#039;s way in no matter what they do.&nbsp; If anything has changed, it&#039;s just the increased value of that stock which did survive customs.<br /><br />And what about the addict?&nbsp; I&#039;m not suggesting that all meth users are trouble users (there&#039;s another question for you: Who here is an ice user and do you feel dependent on the drug?) but I think it would be ridiculous to suggest that there aren&#039;t people out there who need help.&nbsp; But of course, drug users aren&#039;t victims, they don&#039;t need medical assistance.&nbsp; They need a prison cell, a tarnished record and the opportunity to become buddies with serious criminals in the aforementioned detention.<br /><br />Personally, I think every single problem with drugs stems from prohibition.&nbsp; They lied to us as children about drugs being bad and when we found out they weren&#039;t we tried them.&nbsp; Suddenly we became criminals, living in fear of prosecution to do something that made us feel good.&nbsp; We dealt with dodgy criminals on the streets to enhance our own lives, constantly vigilant for the abrupt interjection of a senseless government.<br /><br />And enhance it has!&nbsp; Responsible use of cannabis, LSD and MDMA has changed me as a person for the better and with practically no side-effects.&nbsp; I think of using drugs in a similar way to driving; we all know what can happen when we don&#039;t pay attention, when we go to far: people get hurt... but when we act responsibly and within our limits, we can do things that were previously not possible.&nbsp; When I pull from my vaporizer and hold my woman close, I regularly think about all those schmucks who preach about weed being so bad only to get completely trashed on alcohol and damage themselves, their relationships and even (to some extent) risk their lives.<br /><br />Why is society so backwards?<br />What is the government thinking when they try and utterly fail to control what people do to their own bodies?<br />What is your experience?<br /><br />/rant

				I agree with everything in the OP. There are few areas that the damaging effects of the war on drugs don&#039;t extend. We have Cartels slaughtering each other in Mexico, drug addicts overdosing on poor product produced by criminals who have no care at all for their customers, no thoughts of harm reduction because of this counter-productive political climate of specious arguments and fear mongering. People like us who just which to purchase drugs (I&#039;m similar to you and my interest mainly extends to LSD, weed and molly) have no choice but to contribute to criminal organizations (buying off the street) undoubtedly connected to sex trafficking, political corruption, murder.. the list goes on. <br /><br />I&#039;m Australian and I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the same as the US but the discourse (even in the more conservative news sources) seems to be changing from HARSHER PENALTIES! Stick them in a prison for years so they can magically... stop being criminals? To more of a harm reduction approach. In places like Portugal we&#039;re seeing hugely positive statistics for decriminalization (Time did an article on it called &#039;portugal 5 years later&#039; or something) but decriminalization is still a huge step below legalization. <br /><br />In the end it comes down to ignorance. Ignorance of the public which make the end of the war such a dangerous politcal idea. The heartless politicians who are probably being supported by criminal organisations to keep drugs illegal. UGhhhh it all makes me so mad. <br />Rant v2.

				The police are attempting to seize as much drugs possible in order that the price goes up!<br />Why do you think they keep raising cigarette prices? Yes there are people who will smoke no matter what the prices are for a pack, but if even 10 % or even 5% people quit doing ice because of how much the prices go up (after a big drug bust) then the police chiefs and polititians will go around saying how usage of ice went down X% under them when they got elected and they need to get reelected blah blah. <br />I have no idea if this is the real reason or not, this is my own opinion but this is how I understand the situation

				Governments though are gonna soon realize that drugs are just a way of life and they can do everything in their power to stop them but its just not gonna happen, Soon Cannabis is gonna be legal (In most places) and once that becomes legal I think its gonna get the ball running to get other drugs legal as well, I just recently read an article on CNN about a mom who takes X to deal with her PSTSD and that it helps her tremendously so I think people are starting to realize drugs used in a safe non-hooked way can actually do good things

				Woops, previous post was meant for another thread (definitely not a spam thread....). Anyway, what I mean to say is that drug usage is not going up across the board. Ironically, the places where it is going down are the ones with the most liberal drug laws (portugal for example.) Drug use is surrounded by so much propaganda these days that a genuine scientific approach is often ignored or taken with a grain of salt. Education is a powerful tool in reducing drug dependence, fear mongering isn&#039;t.

				TL;DR<br /><br />It&#039;s about control, as much as anything else we have to put up with by oppressive governments.&nbsp; They would rather people murder and kill and go to jail, than legalize something people will always be looking for anyway.&nbsp; Whoever thought they could eradicate drugs completely is a fucking moron, and so are the people that perpetuate the idea.<br /><br />Meth is not a bad drug.&nbsp; Abusing Meth is bad, yes, but just because you use meth doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll lose your teeth and get mouth diseases, open sores, etc...&nbsp; You have to be smart and NOT let it take over your life, as with any drug.&nbsp; Yes, there are drugs that you can abuse where the side effects aren&#039;t as terrible as meth, but it&#039;s still not good to abuse anything.<br /><br />Anywho, still trying to make 50 posts.<br /><br />Edit :&nbsp; That&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;NOT let it take over your life.&quot;

				I just wanted to add that the key to meth is moderation and taking care of your body.&nbsp; Most of the bad side effects of meth are due to people doing too much meth, staying up for days/weeks at a time, not eating or taking vitamins for nourishment, not drinking enough/staying hydrated with water.&nbsp; You would be sick even without meth if you didn&#039;t take care of yourself.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think smoking or injecting it is the best thing either, but the key to ANY drug is always moderation.&nbsp; You should be happy enough to not have to depend on drugs.&nbsp; That is really important.&nbsp; Any addiction has the potential to destroy lives and health.<br />
