				vendor (92) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ya everyone is laughing right. U want a .5 dropped off? U can meet a pal of mine there if u want. Beats the whole mailing thing right? Sydney or melbourne .. take your pick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />methamatician &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just shows what a greedy fuck you really are mate.Love the way you resort to threats cos you cant match it with wits.<br />3 kegs yet can&#039;t afford to reship .5 out of the 3.5g that you never sent in the first place.<br />Your all class mate what can i say.Just pop in to the forums mate,for a guy as big as yourself not much if anything ever said,and if there is something,i will cut my nuts off if it&#039;s not negative.<br />Yeah you the man,keep laughing buddy,cos every body else is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />methamatician &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when i placed my order you were only going at 94%,since then you have now gone down even more.<br />If i were you i would look for another job as you are only going backwards and by the looks of things there seems to be no improvements on the horizon.<br />Still waiting on a &quot;reship&quot; promise from &quot;team mimm&quot;.If you could at the very least have sent .5 of the 3.5 i originally ordered,then i may have reviewed my feedback. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />&nbsp;1 2 &gt; <br /><br />This is only the last bit of our verbal stoush,i shall leave the vendor unamed for now until i hear from admin or others on what i should do regarding this abuse of power.<br />A little background:&nbsp; Purchased 3.5g of this vendor a while back,needless to say it went to resolution to which the vendor was not the most pleasant to deal with,but got 50% refund and i assumed that would be the end.<br />For feedback,i left a 2/5 saying only got as high as 2 because at least i got half my money back.<br />A few months pass and out of the blue i receive a message from vendor telling me how hard they work and that 2/5 was not a fair reflection of their efforts.I said ok resend me half of my original order as i have been refunded for half already,then i will consider changing feedback.So messages were exchanged back and fro for a few days and then as i began to say just send or stop annoying me already,vendor again ceased coms.<br />Another month passes and there is another message from this vendor,sum unpleasantries were exchanged and then abrubtly ceased again.<br />Unfortunately vendor deleted msgs before i had the chance to copy them.Above is only a tiny bit of what was said,but i think it is enough for you to be able to roughly guess what was said leading up to that.<br />Admittedly i wasn&#039;t an angel but neither did i initiate contact nor did i seek to be contacted.Also perhaps i could have been a little less lippy ,but why should i take threats?<br />Your opinions please

				I now see why no one is honest when it comes to the 5/5.&nbsp; I was ripper by a seller so just being honest i put 2/5 in the customer review and a nice warning to others what he did.&nbsp; A few days later i was bombarded with abuse and that he had my address and so on.&nbsp; Thats when i realized its not a good idea to be honest in review.&nbsp;

				Never had a problem. I don&#039;t use my own address so they could threaten all they want and would end up at a mail drop lol. One thing I noticed in the new forum is some people are just as guilty by blackmailing the vendor with their feedback. You went to resolution and it was resolved. So why leave them a 2/5? It&#039;s just my opinion, but a deal that is resolved that you both agree upon is a 3 or 4/5 depending on how much of a hassle it was. You are buying drugs on the internet, it&#039;s not WalMart. Shit happens. So after you lowball the rating after a successful resolution and he gets mad, you then ask for him to end up going over the agreed upon resolution and give you what amounts to 100% refund by asking for the other half back in product to up your feedback? Honestly, that shit should earn you a ban and you should know better. No offense, it&#039;s just my opinion. I just feel like you got a fair resolution and then decided to be kind of a dick with the feedback and brought it on yourself by making demands he cough up more product for better feedback.

				This is pretty sad that vendors are threatening their customers. I, as a vendor seek the 5/5 and hope to work out any complaints my customers have to achieve that. But I will never resort to threatening those I serve. I just had a customer report to me that another vendor had been blackmailing him. I don&#039;t understand it at all. It hurts the credibility of the entire community and I would urge other vendors from doing so. Just my 2 cents. Good luck fellas. :)

				Here is an idea to combat this problem. Feel free to poke holes in it or whatever.<br /><br />What if we had a &quot;Verified Vendor&quot; section of silk road. A vendor can attain this status by meeting the requirements, I think 99% and over 300 transactions should cut it.<br /><br />The vendor must pay a deposit which is refunded after they revoke their &quot;verified member&quot; status.<br /><br />If the vendor is caught threatening a buyer or something else which is an abuse of power, SR admins revoke the deposit.<br /><br />Has a lot of kinks to work out and I&#039;m sure that it won&#039;t be implemented but I feel as though silk road admins need to begin to work out a proper solution to this as it&#039;s certainly a massive problem.

				&nbsp;:-\ Man! Not good! I wish there were some way buyers were better protected. I can kinda see being upset if a buyer gave a vendor a low score on feedback if the buyer did not bring the issue to the vendor&#039;s attention. But we should be a &quot;Community&quot; and we should be able to feel together as such. I guess the only thing for these buyers who are being threatened is to bring it to the administrator&#039;s attention.

				I dunno, I&#039;m a newbie and all but common sense tells me that one way to hedge your bets as a customer is to buy the lowest amount of product from any vendor to test the waters. My first two orders had problems and they were from well-feedbacked vendors. I&#039;m guessing even the best vendors see newbies as a huge risk and ok to stiff them or give them the runaround.

				That&#039;s unfortunate if that is how vendors are seeing new buyers. But what do I know I&#039;m just a noob vendor. I&#039;m always excited to see new buyers no matter what their stats. But still I think that giving new buyers &quot;the run around&quot; and threatening buyers are two totally seperate things. If you as a vendor are going to screw over new buyers you should expect the reviews. But there should never be any room for personal threats.<br />

I don&#039;t use my own address so they could threaten all they want and would end up at a mail drop lol. One thing I noticed in the new forum is some people are just as guilty by blackmailing the vendor with their feedback. You went to resolution and it was resolved. So why leave them a 2/5? It&#039;s just my opinion, but a deal that is resolved that you both agree upon is a 3 or 4/5 depending on how much of a hassle it was. You are buying drugs on the internet, it&#039;s not WalMart. Shit happens. So after you lowball the rating after a successful resolution and he gets mad, you then ask for him to end up going over the agreed upon resolution and give you what amounts to 100% refund by asking for the other half back in product to up your feedback? Honestly, that shit should earn you a ban and you should know better. No offense, it&#039;s just my opinion. I just feel like you got a fair resolution and then decided to be kind of a dick with the feedback and brought it on yourself by making demands he cough up more product for better feedback.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Mate the guy ignored every pm i sent him in regards as to ow we could come to sum form of agreement that was fair to both parties.<br />just to put into context for you the type of person that i am,i never once have ied or threatend vendors with bad feedback if they did&#039;t bold up their end <br />of the agreement.Also ,it was NOT the vendor that decided to give me 50% refud,it was the decision that admin had decided to make.<br />Member for 4 moths<br />Over 100 transactions<br />Spent $37000+<br />0.70% refund rate<br />0.00% auto finalize<br />You tell me that ith my stats i really would bother to try scamming this vendor.<br />You are entitled to your opinion just make sure that it is an informed opinion,otherwise it just makes you seem like a bit of a dick,( nothing personal,just my pinion)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m really not trying to be a dick and your stats show you are an excellent customer. If it&#039;s a lot of money I can understand why you are upset and threats and blackmail shouldn&#039;t be tolerated by buyers or sellers. You have my 100% agreement there.&nbsp; &nbsp;
