				Heyho,<br /><br />last week I tryed the first time coke, I was curious about it and ordered some.<br />I already snorted some with 2 friends - I think I expected to much and it maybe wasn&#039;t the best set, we we&#039;re just at a friends flat smoking some weed, listening music, talked, nothing special<br />But anyway I got now 0,29g left and I&#039;d like to have at least 1 nice coke experience because I won&#039;t order some again.<br />I already searched for the right dose and found this<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time to onset&nbsp; &nbsp; durability&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amount<br />oral Kokain-HCL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10-30 min&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45-90 min&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100-200 mg<br />snorting Kokain HCL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-3 min&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30-45 min&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40-60 mg<br />&nbsp;<br />I snorted 1x 100mg and another time with my friends about 200mg but I don&#039;t like snorting much.<br />Do you think using the last 290mg into a bomb could be a good idea?<br /><br />I ordered from WorldWHITE my friends meant it&#039;s OK not bad but nothing really special<br /><br />Greetings<br /><br />Ichbins94

				taking cocaine orally is not very intense. i never hear people using it like that. you have to use a lot more and your not going to get the same effects. it might last longer but its going to be very subtle. <br />personally i would sniff it but if you didn&#039;t like that then try eating it. your just not going to fast the fast onset and strong effects. its will be a slow peak with mellow effects that last longer

				the general consensus for alot of the &quot;hard&quot; drugs ex heroin, coke and meth is that its not really worth it to swallow or do them orally. If you really really dont want to snort the coke you could always try plugging it.&nbsp; Plugging is where you mix it with water, put it in a Syringe with no needle and shoot the coke/water mix up your ass. :o
