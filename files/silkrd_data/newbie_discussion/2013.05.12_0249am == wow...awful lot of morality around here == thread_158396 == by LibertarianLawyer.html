				I posted a general topic about escrow; not SR specific. I am new around here and have explored some other vendor sites where the escrow/dispute resolution processes seem to be imperfect at best with a lot of complaints. Just spitballing the idea of a service that would perhaps arbitrate/mediate disputes with complete anonymity and without the need for product specifics. And of course, any lawyer contemplating this would need to remain anonymous as well.<br /><br />I guess the mods hold us to a different standard.

				I think the mods are just tired of dealing with scamming.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously trust is an important part of any party that would hold the escrow funds, how would we know you wouldn&#039;t run off with the funds in escrow?<br /><br />What would your service provide that SR does not already provide?

I have read threads on other boards that have similar &quot;product lines&quot; where the escrow/dispute resolution decisions appear (at least from many party&#039;s standpoints) as arbitrary. Like I said, just spitballing.

				Hey, I&#039;m not planning on firing up a business any time soon, if ever. Like I said, I&#039;m just throwing it out there. While this is the &quot;wild wild West&quot; now, it won&#039;t stay that way. I remember getting on the &quot;internet&#039; for the first time in late &#039;94; it was crude, disorganized, and kind of strange. Terms like &quot;e-commerce&quot; were virtually unheard of, and few companies had websites. I think a lot of people viewed it as a curiosity that wouldn&#039;t last. <br /><br />With so much government intrusion already in place, and more coming soon with no end in sight, I see more legitimate business migrating this way. Those with the foresight to see ahead will do well.
