				No it&#039;s just for dogs. You might chemically castrate yourself if you take dog drugs. If it doesn&#039;t say for people use then don&#039;t take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;???

				Chances are you can, but I&#039;d consult some other resources other than the forum.&nbsp; It probably mostly depends on the drug.

				Yes, you can take it and be perfectly fine.&nbsp; Realize though that the &quot;pet drugs&quot; regulations are much less stringent than standard pharmaceutical regulations, so... you may find more bad batches, or less regularity in dosage from pill to pill, etc., etc..<br /><br />But that&#039;s the only difference, really.&nbsp; I mean that and some pet drugs will kill humans no doubt, but stay away from those and you should be good :P

				i have taken stuff prescribed for an animal plenty of times before. its fine. like ss said <br />your more likely to end up with a crappy batch(i.e weak, dont work at all or adverse effects)<br />but just verify the substances in the pills prescribed for the dog are what your looking for and <br />safe(most are if they are opiates or pain relief)

				Yes, humans can take &quot;animal&quot; drugs. Humans are animals, too! Taking animal drugs is like eating a can of dog food though. I think you&#039;d be better off with nice quality beef mince from a butcher. The chances of you getting poisoned to death are lower that way.

				Most of the time they are the same drugs. You&#039;ll find that most of the manufacturers are the same too. My first job as a kid was at a vets office, Pfizer would bring in all kinds of samples, and would leave human samples too.<br /><br />The main thing to note though, is, some animals - and this can change from breed to breed too - have a different biology. Their medicinal processing and internal metabolisms, are different, for certain drugs. In addition, binders/fillers for animals are regulated about as much as mexican drinking water. Before taking anything, you can generally obtain information on the drug itself, and its formulation in animals, by just looking it up.<br /><br />I would be a lot more hesitant on giving my pet some of my drugs though. Be very careful in this sense. There are binders that will kill dogs, and are harmless to humans. In addition, some breeds have congenital problems that can very easily make a particular drug very dangerous. Cats for example, have extremely weak hearts - there are opiates for cats, but the ones that have a stronger tendency to increase blood pressure easily are very dangerous. Caffeine, and even very minor *drines, are also dangerous. Some dogs also suffer the same problem. To be honest, I would generally advise against human-&gt;pet. There are things animals are very much so adapted to handle... but the reality is, we humans have been using our bodies as theme parks for a lot longer, and as such we&#039;ve got a bit more tolerance in our biological systems for... fun.
