				<br />i wanted to start this thread to talk about a positive experience i made and maybe some others have made some positive experiences, too, they maybe want to share.<br /><br />I ordered some H from BULLDOGISTHEBOSS from Italy. It was a very nice contact, bulldog is a funny guy and the package arrived fast and with decent stealth. The problem was as follows: i couldnt smoke it because it somehow caramelized during smoking, probably because due to some kind of sugar inside. I was still able to pull it, what i did. I left a 4/5 feedback. He reacted in a very positive way: He wrote me and apologized and offered me a full refund right away. I refused, because i didnt want to be greedy. But then he offered me a sample from his new batch to make up for it, what i finally accepted. This offer showed me that he really cares for his customers and that he wants to make them happy, so i changed the feedback to 5/5 and documented the process, to somehow honor his commitment.

				No FE ever (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4f3f1e8eab) was awesome to me about a year ago when I was new to the road. In my desperate quest to find legit LSD in my country, I took some unnecessary risks (FEing early, never do that) and had two different vendors run off with my cash. All in all about $120 so not a huge loss, but it was quite a blow to my confidence for my first 2 purchases. I tried again and ordered from No FE (5 tabs I believe) and did as his name said and waited till I had the package in hand to finalize. Then, excited as I was, I decided to drop my first tab that night. Well long story short, about 5 hours later I had eaten all 5 and still felt nothing. I was... rather upset, but what can you do? I just wrote my feedback and moved on with my life. The next day I log on to find an extra à¸¿7 or so on my account (ahh the days of &lt;$15 coins :) )and a nice apology from No FE saying that he had just tested the batch he sent me and discovered that the entire sheet was bunk. He refunded me the cost of purchase plus a bit more. He certainly dident have to do so, I had sort of resigned myself to having lost the money, and I have always been thankful towards him for that. <br /><br />Sadly right after this he disappeared from the road for several months, and I eventually had my first acid experience with someone else. Still a nice guy and I&#039;m planning on doing some business with him soon. :)

				Thank you very much for the kind words :) I was all set up to be sending out acid today, but unfortunately my acid layers main connection got busted so he will be laying low for a while, but I as soon as he is ready to start laying that lucy again, I will have it up here for everybody, and this time I am definitely going to have it in my hands prior to telling ANYBODY about it :) and this acid connection has been laying acid for 30+ years, and I will test it before it goes out! But in the mean time I have raw cocaine up that people seem to love (except the other vendor who just gave me a 1/5 and at the same time advertised for himself at the same time)
