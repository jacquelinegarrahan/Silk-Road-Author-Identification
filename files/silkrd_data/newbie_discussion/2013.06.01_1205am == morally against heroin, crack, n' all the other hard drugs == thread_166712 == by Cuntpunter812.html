				I smoke ganja, trip, I&#039;ve done ecstasy and coke I don&#039;t care about that stuff; however, I&#039;m morally opposed to heroin and crack and roxy cotin, lor tabs (or whatever the hell they&#039;re called), and all that other opioid shit.&nbsp; Because my friend got addicted to that shit and I&#039;ve seen/heard all the other addicted stories I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve all heard.&nbsp; I also feel as though selling weed is one thing police, society, politicians we can all guess about how they feel about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;With Heroin and crack I feel as though there isn&#039;t much guessing the people (your mother, teacher, co-working cops and politicians) would all be strictly opposed to an online market selling that shit.&nbsp; Now whether you like it or not Silk Road is not the free market utopia some would like it to be DPR opposes thievery such as counterfeit cash, assassinations, and the big one GUNS in fact with the last one I feel as though DPR himselft might be opposed to the sale of weapons, though I understand the claim is that the armory wasn&#039;t economically viable). I&#039;m not suggesting DPR halt the sale of hard drugs similar to the ban on guns only that the weed have its own separate marketplace.&nbsp; Tell me how you feel about it all: weed being in a separate website, your thoughts on H, crack, opioid, the ban on guns.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				If there is a profitable market for weed only, it will be done. <br /><br />Just like the Armory shutting down didn&#039;t stop the sale of black market guns online. <br /><br />I check my morals at the door. Who am I too judge anyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty fucked up myself.<br />

				Yeah I think drawing those sorts of lines is so subjective that it&#039;s not like any consensus will be reached.<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t touch certain drugs, and wouldn&#039;t like to hear that my friends or family were doing them (heroin and meth and crack included), but it&#039;s their mind and their body and their choice. And honestly for me, you separating coke into an okay drug away from crack and opioids seems silly to me. I&#039;ve seen good people royally fuck up their lives and even become a different sort of person through cocaine use. obvi doesn&#039;t happen to everyone. ive done it and it didn&#039;t happen to me. but also, unlike weed or psychedelics you KNOW there is lot of fucked up shit going on with central/south america because of the coke trade. Like if we are talking morality in terms of terrible things happening to innocent people, cocaine use definitely contributes to that. As one of my friends put it, he quit doing coke because he just felt like every time he bought an 8 ball he&#039;d help cut off the finger or ear of a child in Venezuela<br /><br />I mean so does buying clothes made in sweat shops or whatever, we all benefit a lot from other people&#039;s suffering. And I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with you doing coke. But I think it&#039;s pretty inconsistent to thing it&#039;s morally superior to the other drugs you listed. I&#039;d rather smoke opium and have my friends to the same than have anyone close to me be a regular coke user. <br /><br />But I think coke should be on here, reviewable, and available for those who want it :) <br /><br />I kinda like that there&#039;s no guns, but again that&#039;s a personal preference. Aligns with my own morality though so I don&#039;t get too much cognitive dissonance when I come to hang out and buy my adderall and lsd haha

				not an expert, but i&#039;ve tried almost everything (oxys, crack, benzos) except the needles.<br /><br />just don&#039;t like opioids, or weed - opioids are to overwhelming and the weed just won&#039;t work for me, but cocaine clears my head and calms me down believe it or not (accidental discovery).<br /><br />had&nbsp; a friend who would be in a coma-like sleep for half a day after smoking a joint, it affected him that much and of course it was his favorite<br /><br />it&#039;s just everybody is different and if the wrong person hooks up with the wrong thing it can be bad, banning it won&#039;t work though, will limit supply but the addicts will be around<br /><br />

				Ordered my first heroin.<br /><br />I am usually an mdma rave kinda guy, but i dabble in opiates from time to time. They&#039;re not as bad as people make them out to be, they just get a bad name. it&#039;s time to stop using when you are like &quot;oh i had a bad day... lets get high. Oh i had a good day! lets get high! There&#039;s nothing to do... lets get high! Lets go see a movie, oh lets get high first&quot;<br />it just feels so good!<br />Drugs aren&#039;t bad, the people that use them are!

				ghiradeli: I think you raise a good point about coke and the south america issue I forgot about the cocaine cowboys n&#039; scarface shitz I think I made that mistake because I might guess crack is easier to get addicted to as to the reason why I lumped it in there with the others I don&#039;t know if this is true or not its just what I&#039;ve heard. I&#039;m against heroin use cause all of the addicts I&#039;ve seen have lived in nice houses on the good side of town and drove their nice cars to the hood to buy heroin or opioids I feel as though those people have just contributed so much to those areas we all know just just being shitty places to live. And the rich addicts don&#039;t have to suffer the consequences they leave that shitty area and contribute nothing but money for drugs.&nbsp;

When I was in college I went on the &quot;drug journey&quot; escalating from cigarettes and drinking (drinking culminated with the most unproductive time of my life) heavily, to weed (way more productive), to lortabs and xanax (a mellow 2 months)to X (a wild fucking partying two months), and coke a couple of times <br /><br />I really liked the tabs I would just mellow out and feel oh so good, when I got up to X I decided to cool off and only do weed, which I adore.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done coke a couple of times for fun with the old college homies, I would never go looking for it or request it. Now that I&#039;ve been on SR, I&#039;m really thinking of going for the Opium Tea. See if it is nice and mellow, not too much of a ride.&nbsp; <br /><br />Marijuana, ganja, green, bud, weed...this plant is truly miraculous to me. I think you raise a very good point a separate Cannabis market would do the green movement a favor by severing ties with the harder elements of the drug world. Yet again their are still those jackasses that think weed is very bad, just like the op thinks about every other drug. <br /><br />To each their own we should not judge. Apparently, there are very capable smart and efficient meth heads, crack heads, smack heads and everything else because it is all available on the road and you need sense to navigate. Potheads are not the only smart druggies.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m morally opposed to drug prohibition and morally opposed to locking up or persecuting people for using ANY drug, unless they have committed other non-drug related serious crimes such as violence or burglary.<br /><br />I use oxycodone, fentanyl and various opiates on a semi-regular basis and have been for many years with no problems with addiction.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t like psycho-stimulants, and some impulsive, mentally unstable sorts become terrible drug fiends when addicted to stimulants, but I still think it should all be legalized and regulated. I am also aware that many people are able to use ALL drugs without addiction.<br /><br />Alcohol is my opinion is about the worst drug, I&#039;d way prefer to hang with a meth user or heroin user (from middle class backgrounds) than ANY alcoholic from ANY background.<br /><br />I mean I used to be a serious alcoholic myself, and its cigarettes and alcohol that have nearly destroyed my life / health. I have never had any serious problems with any illicit drug, and I&#039;ve done A LOT.<br /><br />As a former alcoholic who found enlightenment through other drugs, I deeply resent the media constantly glamorizing alcohol use as something normal people do, even laughing like its normal and funny to get drunk- I read stories like this all the time.<br /><br />I know this girl who is a SERIOUS alcoholic, and has been charged with various criminal offenses but she HATES ALL ILLEGAL drugs including Marijuana and she would dob someone in for Marijuana too. She is pretty damn ignorant.<br /><br />

				I believe all drugs should be legal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not because I use them all, but in my opinion the majority of problems with drugs are because they are illegal,&nbsp; not because of the drugs themselves. <br /><br />This is why I believe in silk road.&nbsp; &nbsp;People can come here and buy drugs in a safe manner and know exactly what they&#039;re getting.&nbsp; &nbsp;That can never be said on the street. <br /><br />I don&#039;t use the drugs you want banned but I absolutely believe they should be available.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d rather folks come here and get them than create an unsafe situation in my neighborhood. <br /><br />And also your judgment is completely subjective.&nbsp; &nbsp;Where you draw the line others may not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some think pot causes problems.&nbsp; I&nbsp; can say for sure that alcohol causes problems if abused. <br /><br />I believe drug abuse is not a criminal activity rather a public health issue that should be dealt with through education.

				alcohol is legal and there are many problems with the alcohol. the risk of drug use is not a legality issue,&nbsp; maybe some people cannot be saved from themselves. guess the legality thing is the result of some drugs being much more addictive vs the alcohol, some drugs can get people hooked after several uses and the alcohol usually takes longer. alcohol can kill though, for sure

To bad they want to try and ban that to in some areas...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so yeah like the NRA says, &quot;guns don&#039;t kill people, people kill people&quot;, right??&nbsp; wisdom just pours out of you..&nbsp; you actually think that owning a gun protects you??&nbsp; most people who kill with guns either kill themselves or someone close to them.&nbsp; if you really think that you have a better chance if the DoD or Blackwater come knocking because you&#039;re armed then you are very confused..<br /><br />&nbsp;and to be honest, i&#039;m not even against guns, really.&nbsp; i think they&#039;re incredible pieces of engineering art.&nbsp; what i am against is EVERYONE having EASY access to guns..&nbsp; kids out here don&#039;t fight any more or talk shit, because they have guns.&nbsp; its just bang bang, that&#039;s all you ever hear them talk about, thats all you ever see on the news, more dead kids, more domestic murder-suicides, more botched robberies.&nbsp; there&#039;s a very very heavy responsibility that comes with gun ownership, and i honestly don&#039;t think that a lot of people can handle it.&nbsp; i certainly couldn&#039;t, there have been way too many points in my life where i know that if i had had access to a gun, i would&#039;ve blown my brains out, no doubt. but that&#039;s me you know??&nbsp; i think people who can handle should be able to have as many guns as they want but they should have to pass an inspection that shows they have a secure place to store it, that there are no children in the home, and every single bullet they fire should be accounted for.&nbsp; and i think that they should be re-inspected at least once every 6 months to make sure they&#039;re still up to code.&nbsp; once again, i&#039;m only speaking from my experience, but i&#039;m sure that some of you here know what it&#039;s like to hear about what should&#039;ve just been a fistfight between drunk kids end up with one dead and the other&#039;s life completely ruined.&nbsp; it&#039;s heartbreaking.&nbsp; and no, guns are not the cause of the violence, that is something much deeper and systemic, but they absolutely do escalate it in the worst possible ways.&nbsp; just my dos equis

				this has been brought up before a few times. basically it came down to - in&nbsp; the eyes of the law drugs are drugs, whether its pot or smack. you&#039;re still gonna get done if you get pinched for ordering anything off here. so whats the difference?<br />DPR shut down the armoury (SR&#039;s weapon site) because he wasn&#039;t making enough money on it for all the programming involved, so he&#039;s not gonna be arsed to split &#039;soft&#039; and &#039;hard&#039; drugs to different sites

				Being morally against something does not mean estimating it should be forbidden.<br />I&#039;m morally agains heroïn, because of what i saw (IRL, not docufictions) about it. But i&#039;m firmly convinced it should be made legal, and population made responsible about it. Any drug, any consumption product, generates more problems if it is made illegal. Even tomatoes could be dangerous if made illegal.

				I wouldn&#039;t sell heroin or meth or crack either or any other shit substance that fucks up entire lives and families. There is a line between recreational drugs for fun and drugs of addiction that leads to suffering. As to whether SR should sell these substances, that not up to me. I figure if a junkie is going to get a hit he&#039;ll probably be looking for the quickest place he can get it or he can order it on SR and wait a day or more for it to arrive. I could not really care less where he gets it from. Guns Im against and any kind of violence or theft from individuals. <br />Im only on SR for what i do like even if smack and ice are one click away. I can decide for myself what Im interested in and ignore whatever I want. To sum it up SR is brilliant the way it is.

You’re making my point for me. You are correct I have not been around gun violence even though I have spent my whole life around guns; I don&#039;t personally know anyone that has been killed with a gun. The cities with the strictest gun control are also the cities with the highest murder rate. I am sorry you know people that have been murder by someone (by someone not by a gun) the death of a child is horrific. But it’s not a gun problem it’s a poverty problem. Bad guys will always get guns. Heroin and cocaine are illegal but very attainable if you are willing to break the law. If guns were made illegal they would still be attainable by people who break laws. Taking away my rights as a responsible person will not change this.<br />As to accidental deaths from firearms, they are minuet in comparison to other accidents. According to the CDC accidental deaths in 2011 were 120,859. #1 Automobile accidents 42,000 #2 Poisoning 39,000 #3falls 25,000 #4 fires 27,000 #5 choking 2,500&nbsp; accidental shootings come in at about 600 even your swimming pool is more dangerous than guns with 2,000 deaths by drowning. Looking at #2 deaths from poisoning are caused mainly by drugs. Drugs caused more than 10 times the accidental deaths than all other substances combined. The top 3 drug related poisonings were from Opioid prescription pain killers followed by Heroin and Cocaine. Drugs and Alcohol DON&#039;T just hurt the users, you made my point, drunk driving kills more people than guns do. Yes your drugs can and do kill innocent kids when they get into your stash, and they will find it no matter how smart you think you are, and take something that kills them. <br />&nbsp;I will agree with you that 600 accidental deaths by guns especially when it involves a child suck. But again it goes back to personal responsibility, if you have a gun and children then lock them up, the gun that is. Bottom line is making new laws to restrict my ability to own or buy a gun is not going to save a kid that gets shot by a gang banger in Chicago they are already getting their guns illegally and will continue to do so even if you ban them. <br />

				You obviously haven&#039;t thought about that too hard, or maybe you have and you are just not capable of thinking very hard about anything.&nbsp; When you say you are morally opposed to certain drugs what do you mean by that? Does that mean you think people shouldn&#039;t do them and you have the right to force them not to do them?&nbsp; &quot;don&#039;t smoke crack or I&#039;ll point guns at you, beat you, kidnap you and imprison you&quot; is basically what making crack or w/e illegal means - when something is made illegal it doesn&#039;t stop people from using that substance, it just turns a medical issue into a legal issue, which only helps people that make a living keeping drug users locked in cages.&nbsp; If I want to shoot up H and smoke crack who are you to tell me I can&#039;t do that?&nbsp; a moral has to be something that can be applied universally like the non-aggression principle, which says that it is always wrong to initiate aggression, for everyone in all circumstances - not &quot;my friend got addicted to H so I don&#039;t think anybody should be able to do H&quot;.<br /><br />You also say you&#039;ve done coke but somehow also manage to be &quot;morally against&quot; crack (whatever that means). You realize that crack and coke are almost the same thing right? its okay for you to do coke but its not okay for a poor person to smoke crack? DPR is about 1,000 times smarter than you, so I am confident that even if he somehow read your stupid post he wouldn&#039;t consider your barely intelligible arguments for even a second.

				While I don&#039;t condone &quot;hard drugs&quot; (opiates, amphetamines, cocaine/crack, etc.), I find that I am perfectly okay with psychedelics. There&#039;s really little to no harm done with LSD, DMT, Shrooms, and stuff like that. The potential for addiction is just so different, and there&#039;s a lot more danger involved in the former group than the latter.<br /><br />That said, I would not want a separate marketplace just for weed. Because while that is my main purchase on SR, some of those leftover coins can be used on some of the other stuff I don&#039;t mind dabbling with, without having to transfer everything over to other marketplaces. Plus, the security on the Road is great, I don&#039;t think it would be necessary to recreate that elsewhere in a system that&#039;s not really broken.<br /><br />Above all, the Road serves as a place that allows people to do what they want to themselves, openly, without judgement. There shouldn&#039;t be a separation because one drug is more mainstream than all the others. That kind of promotes a sense of elitism.

				I&#039;m morally against MJ and Shrooms and LSD, especially cigarettes and alcohol.<br /><br />H and C and Meth are ok, but I see them as gateway drugs to harder stuff like psychedelics and booze.<br /><br />In all seriousness, the borders are just lines you draw in your own head that are fluid depending on your own life and where it leads you. I was exactly the same.<br /><br />Judging people is fucked full stop and generally because of societial outlook at education. The reason you see your friends &quot;fucked up&quot; or worse is the system that makes it illegal makes dosing unreliable (OD&#039;s) and because society is (like the OP) generally morally against them - they end up socially ostracized.<br /><br />People need to rethink whats really their thoughts and what is just their subconscious understanding due to societies outlook and false education.<br /><br />Every drug has its problems, and some are inherently more dangerous than others, no matter how you look at it, if heroin and alocohol were and always had been legal. Alcohol would been shown to be the more dangerous drug over time imho.<br /><br />Speaking as someone who has seen, lived through most of it, lost loved ones, and has thought about it more than I care to remember.<br /><br />I crossed the &quot;moral line&quot; you speak of some 15 years ago. I now realise it was never my &quot;line&quot; it was just what I subconsciously bought into in my childhood/ youth.<br /><br />Society is fucked until they start treating things as they really are not just &quot;lock em all up&quot;<br /><br />Peace - Tel
