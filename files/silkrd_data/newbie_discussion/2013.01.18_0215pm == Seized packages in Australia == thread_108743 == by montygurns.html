				Hi All,<br /><br />Looking to buy a few pills in the near future (probably 5-10 200mg&#039;s) and was wondering what happened in the unlikely event customs seized the package. Do they simply confiscate it? Or can charges be pressed? As the title says, I reside in Australia (WA).<br /><br />Thanks

				They&#039;re more than likely going to confiscate it and just leave it at that. 5-10 pills is too petty to chase after.<br />That doesn&#039;t excuse you from covering yourself so make sure your house is clean, that means no scales and drugs laying around :P

				They&#039;re quite harsh on drugs in AUS. That&#039;s why the prices here are so high (Example .1 of a gram of meth here $60. A whole gram from the US? $60 lol)

I think they&#039;re more focused on the indigenous drug trade, but hey, who knows! It&#039;s not something I&#039;ve given much thought to until relatively recently. Out of sight out of mind.

				Australia is widely recognized by experienced smugglers as having some of the best customs in the world. They inspect all incoming mail and have done so for several years. The seizure rate for packages to Australia is much higher than the seizure rate for packages to almost any other country. You can import drugs into Australia successfully, but you should imo avoid trying to import pills.Stick to powdered drugs, small amounts (a few grams at the most), NOT shipped in a package or a DVD case, the best bet for getting shit into Australia is for it to be shipped in a regular envelope and disguised to look as much like a letter as possible. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t hold your breath that they will not follow up on a small order. Everybody has the default mindset that the police only care about people who are much bigger than they are, but the thing is these people are just pulling opinions out of their asses and are not basing their claims on any actual evidence at all. They think that if they were LE they would only follow up on big cases, so they think that LE only follows up on big cases. This is called mirror imaging and it is a recognized bias in intelligence analysis.&nbsp;

				I think your spot on with your post but the only saving grace (you can check the annual customs report) is the volume of drugs they seize coming in from O/S. The AFP would be stretched to investigate every seizure however its definitely logged and used for intelligence purposes not just thrown in the nearest bin like a lot of people here would like you to believe no matter the size.&nbsp; Another worry is at anytime they can do a&nbsp; &#039;spot operation&#039; and go after everyone for a short time just to make an example of Silk Road if it gains too much political / media&nbsp; attention, lucky at the moment the political spotlight is on illegal boat people getting into Australia and customs are concentrating most of their resources and efforts on that at the moment - but that can change at any time so yeah stay vigilant.
