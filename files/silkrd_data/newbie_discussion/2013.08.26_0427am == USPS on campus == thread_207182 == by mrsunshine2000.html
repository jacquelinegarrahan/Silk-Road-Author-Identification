				Wondering if they must adhere to the same rules about searching/seizing packages in campus P.O boxes as they would with their own P.O. boxes. AKA can they bend the rules to their favor on campus as opposed to off campus.

				They must abide by the same rules.&nbsp; That is &quot;Official&quot; United States Postage, and it is bound by the same rules and regulations as any where else.&nbsp; Ex ~ Someone Else&#039;s mail comes to your house...you open it...even though it was on your property, you committed a felony by opening it.&nbsp; Whom ever it is addressed to is the only one who rights to that letter, package, and etc.&nbsp; Colleges and etc will not risk the chance of getting dragged into a major suit or a privacy rights infringement battle in court.&nbsp; &nbsp;The same abides with the P.O. Boxes, unless you are in a prison they must handle any official postage by the Postal regulations.&nbsp; Hope the info helped.

				I would NEVER send anything to anywhere owned by a university. It should be common sense as why not to do this.. the less hands your drugs pass through, the less likelihood of YOU being caught

Also the USPS at my campus requires signatures any time a package arrives. So like how do I get around that cuz we only have small mailboxes. Should I just invest in a sizeable PO box?
