				I&#039;ll be there only Friday and Saturday.&nbsp; I hate to try and roll two days in a row but our plan is:<br />Friday - candyflip - two hits of some solid acid and a light molly dose.<br />Saturday - Just molly at probably double the dose from Friday.<br /><br />As you said - possibly some coke in there to keep me going.<br />Have you been before?&nbsp; how hard is it to get drugs into the venue?

				Had anyone ever tried dealing at a festival? The prices people are happy to pay at festivals is always much higher so it could be very profitable, me and my friend were thinking about trying it in the summer.

				Dealing at a festival sounds much riskier than selling here on the road.

Security at festivals in the UK don&#039;t give a single shit from my experience and I&#039;d make sure I was in a big enough group so that it could be claimed as personal use (I&#039;m not talking about each of us having a kilo on us or something ridiculous). I&#039;ve had people come and ask me if I know where to get weed several times at festivals. Would be far more worried about another festival goer trying to jack me tbh.

				i try not to roll the first night at 3dayers anymore. if i cant sleep at all friday going into saturday, then i am just sketched out all day saturday, usually in the blistering hot sun. i used to be a warrior when i was younger and stay up the entire weekend but now that im &quot;old&quot; i like to party friday night with something i can crash on. drink some beers or do a couple lines of k. if i want a little energy i might sniff some coke because it wears off quick enough. Saturday night i&#039;ll roll and do some k.<br /><br />i have made decent money selling at festivals before. its easy to get stuff inside. i wouldnt be too worried about getting busted by security or the popo. i would be very cautious of getting the shit beat out of you and robbed by a group of people or when your in your tent. have a place to store your supply like in your car and make runs to reload a small stash on yourself. never let anyone see your car or your tent and dont run your mouth about having drugs and you can make very nice coin especially if you bring in a product that is in high demand and short supply
