				I went through 10g of that stuff over a few months, if indeed it was the same. <br /><br />I found that as long as I kept the dose at 100mg I felt very little negative effects and no comedown other than a momentary blip around 8 hours then it gradually faded. smoothly. I would redose proably every 12 hours and stay up for 3 nights max before the twitching got too out of control. <br /><br />I knew the possible dangers but because I seemed to be fine on it I just kept going and going until the last bit of dust was gone. Worst tasting chem I&#039;ve ever tasted. <br /><br />Very nice body buzz. Had to avoid coffee or got the jitters. Mood lift that at times could run on for constant for 16 hours. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m off it now though as because as much as I enjoyed it if I had more I&#039;d still be taking it with no clue what damage I was doing to my body. <br /><br />Is that it gone for good other than seeing it once on sr.? <br /><br />Bad batch or overdose or mixture or actually the chemical itself being the cause?

				The reason I ask is that there wan&#039;t this giant witch hunt. It just faded out of existence.
