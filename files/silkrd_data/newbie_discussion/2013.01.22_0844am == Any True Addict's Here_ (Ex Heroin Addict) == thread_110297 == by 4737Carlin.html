				Figured if we gotta post to get to go outside I might aswell post something worth posting,so as the thread say&#039;s are there any truly dependant addict&#039;s that can came to silk road because the garbage that&#039;s on the street&#039;s just isnt worth taking anymore,I ask because i&#039;m an ex heroin addict I started using when I was around 15,there was no peer presure or any kind of emotional trauma I was trying to cover it&#039;s just what I was doing at the time,I didn&#039;t even realise I had a habit until I woke up 1 morning feeling a bit shitty and there was an old time addict round the corner from me she was on Diamorphine ampule&#039;s back then in 1995 so it show&#039;s how long she&#039;de been dependant(I use the word dependant because I was dependant on it) and she said you&#039;ve got a habit,i&#039;m like what,I got a what,I got a habit what the fuck&#039;s a habit so she gave me about 30ml of methadone and that sorted me out a treat,so fast forward 2 years and a neighbor say&#039;s,&quot;there&#039;s some money to be made in this game if you do it right&quot;,I said get in with it then he say&#039;s &quot;I already am do you want in&quot; he knew I was using but he was sound about it I wasn&#039;t exactly your typical heroin addict.<br />I was at work at 14 working building site&#039;s and roofing working for demolision contractors usual stuff where you can be paid cash in hand so I never had to really struggle,so anyway thing&#039;s are going good we&#039;re making money i&#039;ve got my gear for free and I mean as much as I could use it didn&#039;t matter we were moving so much,(as Howard Marks once said)I did try to use as much as I could actually get without losing anything in profit,but there was just too fucking much of it,we supplied alot of street dealers and i&#039;m talking in 1997/8 about 20k a week clear profit,but none of it was mine dont get me wrong I got paid but not that paid,I did get to keep any gold I took for layon&#039;s but I had to give it from my own gear,fast forward to 1999 my dad dies of cancer and I dont mean he died after a battle, he was diagnosed 2 months later he drowned in his own blood and coughed his lung&#039;s up onto his chest,and I was on my own with him,hows that for fucking trauma,so I started to self destruct like any self respecting drug addict I got hammered for about a week gave my business phone to the neighbor and went on bender(I use the word Phone loosely because this was 1999 and they were bricks).<br />So after a week or 10 day&#039;s I dunno I didn&#039;t even know where I lived at this point for god&#039;s sake,i&#039;de been hammering Tamazipam before they got made into shit chalk tablets and they were still green duck egg&#039;s with a gooey centre we could inject,(Awsome stuff)not many about by then but you could still get them,I had the benzo&#039;s covered let&#039;s just say that valium liquid that was nice didn&#039;t taste to great,still doesnt but it does the job,the only reason I went home was because I had to go to the funeral,after all that I wasn&#039;t really all that interested in driving round and dropping off to dealer&#039;s all day listening to they&#039;re fucking whining about why they were short on cash and making me slap em(Make it a proper backhander they not come short again).<br />So that&#039;s where it all started and to cut a long story very short here&#039;s how it end&#039;s I moved away with my mum thing&#039;s went from bad to worse the gear got worse I ran out of money and work lost everything except my mum and that includes 3 sisters 3 nephew&#039;s and a neice that wernt allowed near the evil junkie but I still managed to get by without ever really doing anything to dubious I never went to prison fortunatly I went through so many Detox center&#039;s at the end sometime&#039;s ide forget where in the country I was I was on 40mg&#039;s of valium a day 15mg of Nitrazipam(mogadon) and 120mls of methadone I still get 30mg of valium and 15mg of Nitrazipam and 90ml&#039;s a day but I dont take any off it I took a year out and got myself clean off the chem&#039;s but I kept it to myself I dont think ive been tested for drug&#039;s in over 4 year&#039;s but i&#039;ll still take just enough to show up if I am because right now I need the script because it mean&#039;s i&#039;m legally unfit for work so with that and the support of my drug worker and 2 of the best drug Dr&#039;s in the Uk for references I thought i&#039;de use it to my advantage and become a drug worker because I went through them like needle&#039;s they didn&#039;t know how to deal with me because they&#039;re text book&#039;s told them people only used heroin to block out some kind of pain beit emotional or physical but ive got the 2 best worker&#039;s in my county now,(IMHO)they did try to push me to train as a worker when I got my 2 year&#039;s clean but I wasn&#039;t ready then but it&#039;s 8 year&#039;s on now and thing have started to get better because even though I was clean for year&#039;s I still had no family really,I got clean really fast when I did do it I just stopped because I had the script med&#039;s to do it but I didn&#039;t have anything in place to replace the gear and running round so I sat in the house getting fat.<br />What I really want to know is would you like it if your worker had given you the knowledge to find SR so you didn&#039;t need to use the street&#039;s,(Obviously there&#039;s people you could tell and those you couldn&#039;t)My drug worker&#039;s are more like a decent mate&#039;s now it&#039;s been so long and 1 of them aint as goody goody as he lead&#039;s people to beleive no drug&#039;s, but he&#039;s not someone to fuck about with,it&#039;s going to be atleast a year before i&#039;m anything near qualified in the eye&#039;s of the law so SR may not be here but if you were in a position to help somebody that you knew had the smart&#039;s to keep they&#039;re mouth shut and showed the potential to be a good member of society again, would you give him the knowledge to find SR just to deal with harm reduction,because after all it&#039;s not alway&#039;s getting clean sometime&#039;s it&#039;s just about being stable,I know I wish SR was around when I was using it certainly would have saved me a lot of money.<br /><br />If you managed to read to the end Thanks for taking the time I thought I should atleast say where I was coming from first it&#039;s been 8 year&#039;s heroin free and 1 year off the chem&#039;s except for the trace ammount&#039;s I need for sample&#039;s my family started talking to me again a woman i&#039;ve known for 6 year&#039;s has agreed to move to the Uk from the US to get married(Yes we have met many time&#039;s before) and i&#039;ve basically got reference&#039;s that read like a who&#039;s who of the british Drug service&#039;s the Dr&#039;s reference&#039;s alone are like 2 golden tickets from Willy Wonker and im being offered a good chance to offer the knowledge gained through several years of rehab&#039;s and detox&#039;s,while also understanding exactly where somebody with a dependancy is coming from.<br /><br />Im interested to know if real addict&#039;s actually use SR because it&#039;s easier and better gear.(most of the time)<br /><br />Back to my Bud anyway you lot have kept me long enough,I NEED WEED.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)
