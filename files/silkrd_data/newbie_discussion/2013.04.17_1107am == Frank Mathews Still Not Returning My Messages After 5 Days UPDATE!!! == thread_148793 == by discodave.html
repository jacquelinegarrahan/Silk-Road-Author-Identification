				Hello<br /><br />First of I&#039;m not here to moan about FM. I have read his reviews and seems he&#039;s one of the top vendors. That&#039;s why I placed an order with him.<br /><br />My package never arrived so contacted him to discuss a resolution - as per his vendor statement. It has now been 5 days.<br />It looks like he has read my first message as it says &#039;read&#039; in sent messages and is no longer in bold but has not yet replied.<br /><br />I realize top vendors must be very busy but they are never to quick to take the order.<br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated.

				Frank got back to me today ( 6th day ) offering reship. Lets hope this one works out better than last. Maybe it was as Le Blua says. Funny getting 1 gram stopped unless they were looking out for a certain type of package/ packaging. Who knows? Not I!

				Just came across this - do you mind me asking, since I seen that you got some seixed from customs from frank, was this the same stuff in the other thread you mentioned.&nbsp; If not, very unlucky and great customer service from Frank.&nbsp; Have used him one last year and was happy enough.
