				Question for bitinstant<br /><br />For some reason bitinstant won&#039;t work for me.&nbsp; When i fill out the info and hit place order on the page where is has amount, type of order, etc. it takes me to the next page where you have to type the letters in the recaptcha image to make sure it isn&#039;t spam.&nbsp; The problem is that everytime i get to that page the recaptcha image and box to type it in are not there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve contacted bitinstant and they don&#039;t know whats wrong so I was wondering if yall had any input on what the problem is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on the road for a year now and only in the past couple months has this problem happened...<br /><br />thanks,<br />fh

				have you tried different browsers?&nbsp; their kaptcha isn&#039;t typical (enter these hard-to-read letters), but its more like a java or flash game --&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;You should see items floating around the box with a challenge like, &quot;Drag the items pictured to make a hamburger&quot;

				I use bitinstant without problems. It sounds like you are getting hung up on the page that recommends nearby payment centers.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you need the payment center info to get bitcoins.&nbsp; If you can fill out and print the form, then just bring it to Walmart or CVS, and I think you will be able to make your payment using the numbers on your printout.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t anonymous, though; they will ask your name and address.

				Ive tried most of bitinstants deposit methods, and Walmart has the highest chance of *not* asking for ID proof.&nbsp; <br /><br />CVS didn&#039;t require ID, but their cashiers are clueless about these transactions.

				I use blockchain for a wallet , it either uses bitinstant to facilitate the funding transaction OR they are the same co, I&#039;m not sure.<br />Anyway, I&#039;ve had problems when it came to depositing thru bitinstant and I&#039;ve simply created a new blockchain wallet which takes minutes and problem solved.

You can however; use fake information. They don&#039;t check it out. Just be sure to remember the fake name and phone numbers otherwise it won&#039;t go through and they will say wrong account information. Also, try using different payment centers. The tellers will start to remember you and automatically pull up you account info.

				I&#039;ve been reading a lot of people frustrated with bitinstant lately. It looks, according to post dates, that much of these problems were&nbsp; happening during the spikes and crashes of late.<br /><br />Does anyone here have experience with sending a moneygram through dollar general? They aren&#039;t likely to ask for id, do you think? I could do a test run I suppose.
