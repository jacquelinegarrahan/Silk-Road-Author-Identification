				Hi there guys<br /><br />Fellow SR user here. Now this thread is about a former vendor ( I think former) marijuanaismymuse who is now I believe selling under a new vendor account!!!! Goingpostal visit his profile here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/975e8a2c37<br /><br /><br />Now I have ordered from marijuanaismymuse twice and had no problems, except for the fact that shipping took an eternity and his prices are way too high for the quality.<br /><br />Anywho, I have not ordered from him at all in the recent months, but I did notice ALOT OF BAD REVIEWS OF HIS PRODUCTS (MOSTLY HIS MDMA), MULTIPLE NO SHOWS, SOME PEOPLE THINKING HE&#039;S A SELECTIVE SCAMMER.<br /><br />Now marijuanaismymuse had been a vendor for over a year. Had 90 something % positive feed back on over 300transactions.<br /><br />I&#039;m worried he went scam, closed his account. Moved all the funds over to this new account goingpostal and is now going to continue vending.,<br /><br /><br /><br />WHY WOULD SOMEONE WITH GREAT FEEDBACK SUDDENLY START A NEW VENDORS ACCOUNT AND ABANDON THE OLD ONE AND REMOVE ALL LISTINGS FROM THE FORMER ACCOUNT.<br />\<br /><br /><br />Now my only speculation for him being the same person is this. About a month or 2 weeks ago when SR was down I noticed a new account spring up on atlantis or BMR I can&#039;t remember which one. It was called goingpostal. It had all the same listings as marijuanaismymuse from SR and similar prices and every single picture of products were the same!<br /><br />Now goingpostal has an account on SR and every picture is the same as marijuanaismymuse had.<br /><br />Did I mention he lists A LOT OF ALL THE SAME PRODUCTS, SAME PRICES AS MARIJUANAISMY MUSE HAD<br /><br /><br />Maybe he&#039;s not a scammer, just starting a new account for his own reasons. But I find it weird you would abandon an account with good feedback all of a sudden and start a new one, I believe he may be starting a new account because he has taken off with the funds from his previous account<br /><br />If any full members see this could weigh in or post it in SILK ROAD DISCUSSION for the others to see who probably don&#039;t visit htis forum anymore!!!<br /><br /><br />Be careful people!

				I dont mean to be argumentative or anything here, but your answer gives absolutely no reasons or evidence to back it up and at the moment, can only, in my mind, be added to the &#039;paranoid&#039; or &#039;disliker of MIMM&#039; section<br /><br />Maybe you would care to elaborate, or supply any facts or evidence to support your theory? Because atm, I see no reason to believe it

				Actually, I just noticed the other thread about him<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156557.0<br /><br />Seems like there may be something untoward about the guy

				I think the official storyline from goingpostal is that they and MiMM are part of the same operation, but not the same person.&nbsp; Who knows, but you&#039;re free to do a search on goingpostal to see the other mentions of this subject lately.

				ACTUALLY...i can clear this up.. it feels nice. and I am higher than I should be prob.<br /><br />So GOINGPOSTAL is MIMM no doubt on atlantis and on Blackmarket so maybe/prob is here as well as he has had some issues with selling to AUS and people giving bad reviews due to not getting shipped materials there. (somewhat his words paraphrased)<br /><br />I know that goingpostal is legit on BMR because before I used SR i tried GOINGPOSTAL on BMR based on his silk road reviews and postings... (someone informed me that BMR was a better place because it was a faster site with no downtime..i now am exclusive here as I prefer a few of the vendors here much more)<br /><br />So anyways GOINGPOSTAL on BMR is legit and sells the same stuff MiMM is selling on SR and says he is MiMM which means he probably is (small good rep going on there on at BMR)<br /><br />Good blonde Hash in my opinion though I dont get good hash very often... its hard but a really nice clean taste and high<br /><br />I bought when he was having a sale too.. bonus for me.. he was really nice to me in dealings and questions and really didnt take too long .. had packages take longer (pulls out hash joint soaked in oil ... i love you SR)
