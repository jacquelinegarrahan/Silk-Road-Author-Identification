				I am from Australia. There is only couple of vendors that sell heroin down here and its not that good quality. I am after medical grade heroin known as diamorphine. Plse if anyone in the world has this to offer let me know i want to buy it. In the country&#039;s like UK diamorphine is given to long term addicts if they cant cope with other opiate replacement therapy&#039;s like bupe and methadone. In Germany and Switzerland is the same. So people from these countrys can obtain this easily. So if anyone can get it let me know i am really interested.<br /><br />Merkin&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s not prescribed much here in the UK, it&#039;s more of a last resort than anything else - quite closely monitored too.

They&#039;re being phased out as well. They&#039;re like rocking horse shit in the UK.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in London you can buy methadone amps from the patients in private clinics but that&#039;s all street deals.<br /><br />I too would love some liquid diamorphine. best you can get on SR is morphine tablets.<br /><br />I think I saw a listing on Atlantis or BMR for diamorphine vials but the deal looked dodgy, no escrow, no feedback.<br /><br /><br />There is a Canadian vendor ( I think) who is selling pethidine vials. Closest thing I&#039;ve seen on SR.<br /><br /><br />Why not order some primo #4 Heroin? There&#039;s some good stuff kicking about, good #3 as well if you want to smoke it.

				pakchoi23 i tried few no4 vendors on here that claim high purity for their product but it was just a tad stronger than street quality heroin. R u aware of proper 80% + purity heroin here? I think no one on SR has 80+ purity except maybe smileawhile but he doesnt ship to australia anyway.

				Ye pakchoi we have issues with imports down under because customs are so strict. That&#039;s why price of H down here is so expensive. It&#039;s hard to find bent doctors down here as well. They r around but you have to really look for them. And plus in australia diamorphine is not used in clinical practice. It&#039;s whether morphine or oxycodone. I tried couple of year ago to get morphine tablets script and I went to worst possible area to c doctor where 80% of residents are drug addicts. I know it was really dumb thing to do. In that area all doctors are educated about addiction and people doctor shopping. Anyway he requested my family doctors details, my specialist details and I was red lighted in the system as doctor shopping for narcotics. But I have like few months left and that will be off my record, so I will try again soon. And I am pretty sure I can get some MS Contin as I have MS as well. Anyway mate it&#039;s good that u don&#039;t shoot up. Don&#039;t do it. Keep snorting or chasing it on foil. Needle is too good u know. Anyway bro if u come across anyone with diamorphine let us know ye?

				You could always get some H and just really purify it, there are instructions on the net to do so. If your not snorting or IVing it though i dont see the point. Also, iv heard from a number of people that use heroin that once they got the prescription heroin, it wasnt as good as normal heroin, somehow some of the stuff thats left over in the process effects the high and makes it better, atleast to some people. Thats IVing though.
