				Anyone find it strange that just about every single news article about the BTC somehow relates it to a currency that is used primarily for buying items on SR?&nbsp; Maybe one of these journalists should take note (as well as get their heads out of their asses) that the BTC didn&#039;t do anything abnormal over the long period of downtime SR has been experiencing... So, in theory, if the BTC was just about buying drugs on SR, wouldn&#039;t we see something out of the ordinary with the activity of the BTC?&nbsp; I would think so.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I think SR is always mentioned in those articles because it accounts for most of actual bitcoin spending, the other BTCs are mostly used for trading and investing I think. But yeah, the BTCs spent in SR are nothing compared to the BTC used in trading.

Although that could just be a further correction after the bubble we just had.<br /><br />Could be, could be investors playing the BTC, also could be the increase in network hashing difficulty.&nbsp; On April 17th the difficulty went up 16.96% to 8974296, and then on the 30th it jumped another 12.28% to 10076293 - That could have something to do with it too.&nbsp; Back to your point, look at a 10-day mtgox chart and look at the roller coaster ride... It&#039;s all normal.<br />
