				Simple question, how many of you guys dropping acid or any other psychedelic drugs for party purposes.<br />I have tried lsd three times and i could never imagine myself doing it at a social setting and especially a party, depends how you want to use it ofcourse, i tried mdma not so long ago (and i know its not a psychedelic) at a club which just made me wanna dance, but after a while i just wanted to sit and enjoy? <br /><br />how have your party experiences been on psychedelics if you have any <br /><br />cheeers

				I have found that Psychedelics and big groups of people do not mix well at all, at least not for me. I remember a couple months back i was candyflipping which is mdma and some really clean LSD (Thanks Tessellated!!!) and i just couldnt keep a conversation going with anyone. I tried talking to this girl and she just laughed at everything i said. i was extremely confused and sat in a corner and smoked weed with my good friend for the entirety of the party. So in my opinion, LSD is at its funnest if you are with a larger group of people you know who are also doing it as well. Hope this helps!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

				<br />I love doing trips at parties.&nbsp; You have just got to be in the right mindset. And obviously be able to handle your trip. Like MuddButt said sometimes it is hard to follow conversations but on the whole I love going to clubs and taking Trips. Especially when you leave the party at it is just getting light and you walk home whist still tripping. Amazing!<br /><br />Clockwork

				I like to take it at concerts because it makes the music sound really good, but I am usually uncomfortable the whole time.&nbsp; Being around a bunch of drunken people isn&#039;t fun while I am tripping, it&#039;s usually worth seeing an awesome band though.&nbsp; I prefer to be at home with no more than 3 other tripping people.

				I don&#039;t really like psychs for parties, I&#039;d rather stick to stimulants and alcohol. I keep my psychs for festivals and small groups of friends.

				25i was interesting. The blacklight was really intense and created the weirdest images. My talks with girls were extremely in depth, but it makes you realize how stupid alcohol is in comparison to psychadelics
