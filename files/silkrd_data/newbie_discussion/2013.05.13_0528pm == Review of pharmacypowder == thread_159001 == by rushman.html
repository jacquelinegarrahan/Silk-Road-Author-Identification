				Hello,<br /><br />I am one of the recent few who had a negative experience with this vendor. The following is copied from my post in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168743 for increased visibility.<br /><br />I placed an order with Pharmacypowder about 6 weeks ago and never received anything after continuing to extend for well over 30 days, based on his repeated assurance that it would arrive and that the unreasonably long wait was due to the unpredictability of Canada mail, in itself understandable. He claimed to have had one order take 29 days to the US. It was clear, potential shipping mishaps and all things considered, that nothing would be coming after 4+ weeks. The way he handled my inquiries was pretty indicative of selective scamming. He was totally unwilling to work with me to remedy the situation, and actually offered me an insulting 5% refund. It sucks to take a hit on buyer stats because of unscrupulous vendors, but I&#039;m not OK with losing my money for nothing more than to preserve refund %. A real shame too, it would have been awesome to have a solid Alprazolam powder vendor, especially at his prices. Someone who can actually do business the right way and hasn&#039;t had any problems with this guy should step up and reship his product from inside the States.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Layob<br />
