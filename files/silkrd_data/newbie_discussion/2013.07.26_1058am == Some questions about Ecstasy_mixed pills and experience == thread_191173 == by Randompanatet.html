				Hi, i got some various&nbsp; experiences with my favorite drug MDMA, and i got some questions so i can learn something.<br /><br />I used MDMA/mixed pill about 5-6 times total.<br /><br />The first time is always the first time i know, but this felt a little different than the rest of them. It was about 2008-2009 me and my friend took 1 and a half Pink/Red Mitsubishi each (yes ive read deaths about them from earlier batches)&nbsp; :o Anyways it was different than the high i get from the MDMA/MDMA pills on Silk Road. <br /><br />More energy and rush with about the same emphathy, maybe a bit less. <br />And i felt a little touch of &quot;not seeing from my own head&quot;, like when real high on super skunk or something. But in the same time i was very presence.<br />More visuals then the MDMA i tried last years, like seeing an old movie that has no color but with color.<br /><br />And btw the setting was terrible, 3 guys, me and the other who took it, the other guy drunk. I thought i bought junk and was lying in my bed and resting when it suddenly blew me out of the bed.<br /><br />All in all i felt like the people i see in the old rave/dance party videos from the 80/90s.<br /><br />I could sleep no problems, and the day after wasnt too bad, like going out from the theaters feeling, on a late evening.<br /><br />So what do you&nbsp; think it was? Speed in it? Some other drug?<br /><br /><br /><br />Also i wonder why there is almost only pure MDMA pills on Silk Road? A bit of speed in it wouldnt hurt some couch huggers i believe.<br /><br />I really want to try the Orange Triforce on Silk Road, anyone tried it and can compare it to my virgin story?<br /><br /><br /><br />I do realize that the setting is very important and do wait atleast 1-6 months between each session.<br /><br />Sorry for my poor english&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thanks in advance everyone!<br /><br />

				The reason you don&#039;t see many &quot;speedy&quot; pills on silk road is that many people became upset with the random pills flooding the market that no one really knows what is in them and at what dosage - could be meth, could be another amphetamine, could be almost ANYTHING else. If you like the speedy buzz, you can always choose to purchase another stimulant to do with your MDMA, that way you can control the dosage and be sure of what you are taking.

				The colors and designs on the pills used to actually mean something back in the day, like who the dealer is, the pureity, and what the cutting agent was like speed or coke, nowadays it doesn&#039;t mean anything...

				I see, it would ofcourse be great if you get what your looking for. Still its weird that i can only find one pill thats not only MDMA in it. Maybe people do like you say, take some speed separate. Should you swallow it with the MDMA or snort when MDMA effect comes? I figgured out that if you swallow you need some more because Amphetamine is waste 30%ish when swalloed compared to snorted. So how much standard street Amphetamine would be good with 150mg MDMA?

				Sorry, I don&#039;t know much about street amphetamines, but I would say you should do half what you would normally do if you weren&#039;t doing MDMA for mixing. It&#039;s up to you if you eat it or snort it, snorting is a quicker and harder buzz but eating will last longer.

				Without test lab, only assumptions can be made (in my opinion, of course)<br /><br />If you want only mdma, buy mdma crystal, pills usually have other amphetamines, and many more things ;)<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Index25
