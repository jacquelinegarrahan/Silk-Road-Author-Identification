				So I ordered 330$ via vanilla reload sat night. Benzo king said his partner was screwing him up and it would be a little bit. I messaged him again today to ask what was up and he was prompt and said he&#039;d get me a refund on a reload card because of issues he was having. He just sent me a reload it pin number for 350 and said that&#039;s all I have .I call to check the balance before purchasing a card and its already been drained. WTF?!!!! This seemsblike its the second time I&#039;ve been scammed . hopefully he makes good on it and gets me my refund . but beware of benzoking right now. I&#039;ll keep you updated

				Wow I had a feeling about this guy. For the past week I&#039;ve been thinking of using him to make a large purchase $300 + but I&#039;ve just been sitting back watching and waiting. The reason is that this BenzoKing is not the true owner. The account was sold over 2 months ago. This is a fact. The previous BenzoKing only sold percs and hard to find Benzos. He was awesome, great packaging, cool shipping and nice guy. <br /><br />His account was inactive from Feb. till about July but the listings were totally different. It was BTC and money transactions. I have a theory on why this happened but it may be far fetched but not impossible. I believe the real BenzoKing was arrested and his account was comprised by LE and they are using it to gather intel. What better way to grab Vendors. Someone sells over $1k worth of BTC then there&#039;s a good chance that they are a vendor. After that LE just follow the trail of that Moneypak or wherever the cash gets mailed to. You think I&#039;m just a paranoid? Check this:<br /><br />CLEARNET ---- http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/23/secret-service-fake-ids<br /><br />It was called Operation Open Market and it lasted four years. That really opened my eyes to be truly paranoid. Agents or cops can&#039;t sell drugs but they sure as hell can sell money or BTC. Be careful out there.<br /><br />

				So anyone else have issues with benzoking? I haven&#039;t seen anything bad about him recently but this so called helper made him short on coins but its just not adding up. I never got my coins either so that&#039;s quite a bit of money to have been messed up. I really wish I knew this account was sold. I hope to I still get my coins im really worried about this now and I wasn&#039;t until I saw this forum thread. The person who got the reload card sent to them you can call the company and ask them what time the reload card was redeemed I would suggest doing that might help us figure out whats going on. if you could can you message me the last few digits on the card? I wanna see if maybe he just sent you my card so it would show up as being redeemed so he can be like oh well you redeemed it. Another thing that has me worried is the lack of recent transactions in the feedback. there is 1 that was finalized recently. The order hasn&#039;t been cancelled what about yours? I hope to hell I didn&#039;t get scammed. Either way I have learned my lesson about buying BTC on the silkroad.

				I don&#039;t wanna sound like an asshole but I hope he&#039;s just a scumbag scammer and not LE posing as a vendor. Can someone please explain to me how I knew that this account was transfered and I&#039;m hardly on here but no admin or mod did. Apparently it&#039;s allowed. This is a clear example of why it shouldn&#039;t be. I come along buy an established account from you for $1k or w/e pull my scam for 3-4 weeks net $5k. <br /><br />Sorry you&#039;re out the money dude. I been in that spot before and it sucks but after that experience I trusted no one and that actually made me safer. Anyways I hope it gets worked out though. Still don&#039;t how the fuck accounts can be transferable?? Someone please tell me my info is wrong.
