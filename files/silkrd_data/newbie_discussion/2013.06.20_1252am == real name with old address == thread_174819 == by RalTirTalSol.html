				i&#039;m reading up on shipping advice, trying to come up with the most favorable option for me. new PO boxes are out of the question.<br /><br />2 years ago i used to live with my grandmother and would get plenty of mail there<br /><br />would it be wise to use my real name and her address for my purchase?<br /><br />i never lived there officially but long enough to not seem fake. <br />but it was never my real address so i could have a shot at denying myself out of it<br /><br />what do you think?

				I think sending drugs to your grandmas house is a real dick thing to do. Send it to your house or at least someones house who knows they are about to get something illegal.

				bump, opinions on the setup of using an old unofficial address, please<br /><br />my granny can hardly take care of herself by now and it would be of great help if I would drop more often to handle her mail and shop groceries for her<br />besides, i would probably trust her before i&#039;d trust anybody else. I would probably be sincere with her about what I will be ordering to her address<br />hell, if she&#039;d want to i&#039;d gladly give her some pot

				Here&#039;s a compromise. It&#039;s a 2 part suggestion.<br /><br />1) Start going around to visit your grandma, even just to chat for a few minutes, even if she&#039;s old and feeble and boring.<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t send illegal anything to her address. Come on man! Just get it sent to your real address and leave innocent 3rd parties out of it. There&#039;s some risk involved in buying drugs that you have to accept if you want to get high.

				Sometimes its shocking how caring the people on an illegal underground black market can be about peoples grandma&#039;s!! lol <br /><br />The only grandma i care about is my own so i will answer the question seriously, plus you have already said that your grandma will know what you are getting delivered anyway!<br /><br />I would say this is a perfectly fine idea! As its one of your old address&#039;s its perfectly feasible that people would still send you mail there! Although the way i see it, it doesn&#039;t matter where your mail goes you always are able to deny it just the same! The main benefit here is that if the address does ever get burnt its not to bad because you don&#039;t live there!! Also you wont be storing the drugs there so really there isn&#039;t any risk for your grandma! I would however advise your grandma not to sign for anything that&#039;s for you! She should just advise that she wasn&#039;t expecting to receive a delivery on you behalf!!

I would also hate to think of LE questioning my grandma about why she has drugs coming through the post! lol<br /><br />still shocks me how everyone is so protective over someone else grandma!!

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a terrible, terrible thing to do..but the risk of LE approaching any of my family members is certainly not appealing. I use an &quot;old&quot; work address- I still work there part-time and I&#039;m there often, also I&#039;ve been receiving packages from all over the world there&nbsp; (ebay, amazon and such) since 2001 so I don&#039;t believe there is any added scrutiny. <br /><br />I do have what I believe is a better option which I have also used once or twice successfully but it may or may not be available to you: I still occasionally receive mail for a couple of older occupants at my address- a real name- just not mine, my real address but not my name, so I think the plausible deniability is in full effect.<br />
