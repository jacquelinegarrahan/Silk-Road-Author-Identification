				When you finalize the process (after your package arrived) you have to rate the vendor from 1 to 5 and a little Text. There you can thank the vendor. If you were so statisfied that you want to do somethin extra then go look in the forum for his product review thread and write an review about your order

				If you click the &#039;orders&#039; button at the top of the page and then &#039;finalise&#039;, it will lead you to a page where you can leave the review. <br /><br />You can leave a review saying whatever you like, just don&#039;t describe the packaging :)

				Keep in mind that leaving a review also implies finalization.<br /><br />Finalizing releases the funds to your vendor as they are held for you by silkroad acting as a middleman(escrow is the name for this). The longer it takes you to finalize after recieving your package the more and more (rightfully) pissed the vendor will be at you.<br /><br />Tl;dr Don&#039;t finalize before you get the package but as soon as you get it and you&#039;re sure it&#039;s what you paid for(don&#039;t wait a week to trip on the acid you bought before finalizing) then FINALIZE.

				Hi, I was in pretty much the same boat as you yesterday. having FE&#039;d an order i had to hunt through the newbie discussion to find alternate review threads for the vendors after promising more substantial feedback. <br /><br />long story short, the search tool is your best friend, put in the vendor&#039;s name and if they have a newbie review thread it will come up there. looking through, it seems like most vendors, even the ones only in business for a short time, create threads on both standard and newbie discussion.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
