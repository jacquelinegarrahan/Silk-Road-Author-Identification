				Hey guys and gals,<br />I am a&nbsp; male, 210 lbs, and have been on opiates in 1 form or another for the past 5 years. Most recently on 12mg per day suboxone maintainence. For the past month I have been on my own little heroin binge, and my perferred ROA is to snort lines of some fire #4 off the road!<br /><br />Right now I just got 2 grams in the mail of marlos #4 who has been my goto guy ever since he has come around. His product it amazing and the price is right!<br /><br />Well I had 230 bucks left in my account, and I needed to get an order in so that I can make sure I got some H for this upcomming weekend when me and some friends are spending Friday and Saturday in atlantic city. My usual venders did not have any listings up probably because of all the BS going on with the DDOS attacks on the road. <br /><br />After looking through the Heroin listings, I saw that I had EXACTLY enough BTC to purchase 1.25 Grams of &#039;Gunpowder&#039; BTH from Einstein666 WITH EXPRESS SHIPPING!! It was like a sign.. I mean, when I say EXACTLY, i mean that after my purchase I had 0.00 BTC left :)<br /><br />I never journied away from my usual #4 heroin, and being on the east coast, I have never had the &#039;pleasure?&#039; to try some BTH, but since my ROA is to snort, it didn&#039;t seem like a wise choice anyway.<br /><br />Well the picture for his &#039;gunpowder&#039; bth looked good to me. In the description he said how it is mainly powder with several larger chunks &#039;glass&#039;, which to me sounded perfect, i can just put it under a bill and crush it down to fine powder.<br /><br />I am asking some of you experienced guys what my best bet would be for snorting this new substance. <br /><br />ALSO<br /><br />Whatever I do must be concealed so that my girl and friends don&#039;t know Im doing it. Right now I usually just say im taking a crap, bring my ipad and break up and snort off of that in the stall.<br /><br />Sorry for the essay, I hope I broke it up enough so its not too tough to read.. And I hope you guys can help shed some light on this so that I am prepared when my package comes in the mail tomarrow (monday).<br /><br />Thanks guys and gals! TTYL. If you need to know anything else just ask, Ill be here.

				i&#039;d recommend cooking it up into a liquid and then sucking that liquid up into a small syringe (obv without a needle on it, an ear syringe from cvs or walgreens will do just fine-- an empty visine bottle will do in a pinch as well) and then snorting the liquid-- it may be gross but you&#039;ll get way more of the product that way-- at least in my experience, you lose a lot of BTH/gunpowder if you just snort the powder, as a lot of it may just end up down your throat and into your stomach.<br /><br />i have 6 years of experience on the west coast doing BTH, fwiw.

				hey sir, thanks for the quick reply.<br /><br />I have been reading on that techniquie, I think its called &#039;monkey water&#039;? But I have tried on several occasions to snort a liquid, for example suboxone with water, but I have had really bad luck.. I always seem to drip and waste it all.. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m good enough for that to be a viable option, unless you can maybe tell me a fool proof way to do it?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Lster

				To everyone suggesting that OP quits his habit. Please, come on... You think anyone wants to be addicted to heroin? Just about the worst drug on the planet and the meanest mistress of them all. I&#039;ve never personally done it, and I never will, but having lived alternatively for 2 years in protest camps, squats and on the streets and having met hundereds of addicts I can say it&#039;s certainly not as simple as taking someone&#039;s advice and quitting.<br /><br />OP, I will however suggest you do it in extreme moderation and try not to use it to &#039;escape&#039;, that&#039;s how it grabs you. Most importantly, remain in control of your consciousness, I&#039;ve yet to meet a &#039;good&#039; heroin addict, somebody who has maintained their morals and ethics after becoming hooked. I lived in the flat of a heroin addict for 4 months, I thought he offered me a place out of good will but upon learning he&#039;s addicted I began to connect the dots and see he was just using me, he regularly &#039;borrowed&#039; money and was planning to steal my Pit Bull, amongst other things but that&#039;s gone and his blame can be negated on the basis he&#039;s an addict.<br /><br />To anyone who&#039;s trying to give their 2 cents and help OP by telling him to quit, I dare all of you to take a hit and see if it&#039;s simple to just say no to the next one.<br />

				Hermit, thanks for the points, but heroin is and has always been my drug of choice. Started with Percs, then oxys, and now the dope. Guys I didn&#039;t make this post to be an Intervention. As I said, I ordered it already, and I am going to be using it to get high today, and it won&#039;t be the last time I am using the H.<br /><br />Underbelly.. Your not my mother, so please stop telling me how bad this is for me and how i should stop, ALL drugs have they&#039;re ups and downs. Im a good kid who happens to enjoy heroin. <br /><br />So now for the reason I started this thread, Can anyone WHO IS A USER OF BTH give me some tips on the better ways I can go about setting it up to snort.

I&#039;ve done a few different kinds of pain killers before... very curious about H. Snorting? I could do that. I&#039;m willing to give it a taste. Currently consume uncut coke... everyday for about 3 wks, for medical (in place of adderall) purposes--1 to 2 bumps per day. Occasionally I&#039;ll put a few bumps in a can of coca cola--like Babe Ruth once did before each home run.&nbsp; 8) So far, my tolerance is increasing slowly--the euphoria is slipping away, at which point I routinely take a month off from substances.<br /><br />Anyway, H is destroyed when ingested? What about coke? What&#039;s the most effective delivery system--without I.V. injections--for H and coke? I have reservations about snorting, as I am prone to sinus infections and don&#039;t wanna see the EENT doctor b/c of my drug use.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />...and good luck on your BTH!

				Howdy, being from the South Black Tar heroine is the only type I have ever been able to enjoy, except for one time when I was given a major blast of tan #4 from a very old European friend I had not seen in years, and I trusted him to fix me since it was his gear.&nbsp; I don&#039;t snort, I shoot.&nbsp; While I am sure someone can OD by snorting, someone can definitely OD by shooting.&nbsp; We would get 20$ &quot;papers&quot; (that is what they were called) which were a dab of black tar between two pieces of celophane clear plastic.&nbsp; You gently separate it, place the chunk you wanted in the spoon, and then take the distilled water from your CLEAN NEW PERSONAL syringe and wash the tar until it disolved.&nbsp; Then you would hit with a lighter for just a second until it bubbled only a bit.&nbsp; We did not cook it a lot, despite many claiming it to be dirty.&nbsp; Wet a tiny cotton ball and fill the syringe being careful. Remove syringe from spoon, hold upright, tap with finger to release air bubbles to top. Depress plunger until the liquid beads at top- forcing the air out.&nbsp; Tie up limb and inject.&nbsp; <br />Some tips: I found that serious users like my friend from Europe to the time to add far more water to their hits, and dilute more, even if the dose stayed the same.&nbsp; While there could be any number of reasons for this, I simply found it to be a far greater rush and ease of withdrawals. Some may say the gear was just better those times I increased the amount of water and time necessary for dilution, or maybe experience allowed a better injection, but from now on no matter what type of gear, I will always endeavor to add more water for a bigger shot. They also told me that they do this on unfamiliar gear to take a longer shot so they can pause in mid-injection if anything seems really wrong- but this could be heresay.&nbsp; A typical paper would allow a major hit with about a 35% extra bump hit.&nbsp; I know I am a lightweight, but some of my friends were already doing the methadone clinic.&nbsp; As an aside, I personally got far more of what I was looking for from pharmaceutical dextromethorphan hydrobromide in the form of Romilar brand tablets.&nbsp; My first time on that I orally took 18 x 100 mg tablets, waited and hurled, then took another 5 x 100 mg tablets.&nbsp; We found our in Japan and some folks can still get them in France.&nbsp; This was roughly 1800-2300 mgs (minus buffer and pill coating) so probably at least 1,000 mg of pharma DXM, substantially more than anyone could easily drink as cough syrup.&nbsp; It makes people who talk shit on Erowid look like ignorant pussies.&nbsp; That summer, after I developed a tolerance, I stopped throwing up and we pushed it up to 44 x 100 mg tablets.&nbsp; So I bring this up because I used my ROMs experience to consider my black tar experience, and from my perspective in considering my heartbeat and breathing, and other physiological factor that tell you when you&#039;re dying, I always did less heroine and never got into that deep hole similar to a K-Hole which is also a disassociative like DXM Hbr. That hole is what I was looking for as a user, and having had it, it was easy for me to kick when it became inconvenient.&nbsp; Thus, I have always been a recreational user.&nbsp; As a musician, that hole allowed me to go into music and journey to ego loss.&nbsp; But on heroine, I always wanted silence, and would only put on Miles Davis the next day super quietly- from one junkie to another.&nbsp; I would absolutely do heroine again, and I have priced the wares here at SR, but my desire for more social recreational drugs have taken me more into MDMA/MDA/Weed, and my situation is such that I just don&#039;t have the time to journey into tying off for a week.&nbsp; I also think it is wonderful that when SR is up, we can get opium- which is truly one of life&#039;s great joys.&nbsp; &nbsp;For those who say- &quot;Oh, it&#039;s so bad&quot; they seem to speak out of ignorance.&nbsp; But I have also done really good freebase of cocaine, and a lot of naysayers will immediately go hit that.&nbsp; From my perspective, the jones and weirdness that I dealt with from the folks around me on coke versus those on junk was amazing: coke freaks will steal from you while you watch them do it, pick up crow bars in absolute paranoia and begin screaming at everyone in the room, then go stare out of the peep hole of the front door gripping the crow bar so that not only are they threatening you- you cant leave!&nbsp; Junkies just fall asleep and beg for a hit.&nbsp; Of the two, heroine is by far a more civilized drug.&nbsp; I did not mean to highjack the thread, but I DO have an unashamed love affair with H and wanted to post.&nbsp; BE CAREFUL and BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN LIFE.&nbsp; Peace, DrunkenAfficianado&nbsp; 8)
