				Can someone help me understand how to use this?<br /><br />You have to make cash deposits it seems, you can&#039;t do it online like from your bank account I take it? Is that correct.<br /><br />Also, where do you make the deposits at? I don&#039;t understand.<br /><br />There is a local CVS that I can do it at I guess, what do I do<br /><br />Do i just talk to someone working there and tell them I want to make a bitinstant deposit or something? I&#039;m really confused.

				It&#039;s to my understanding that all you have to do is:<br /><br />1. Go to the bit instant site.<br />2. Click new transaction<br />3. Fill out the info using a fake name / email ( I&#039;ve heard that it is fine to use your real name and that some places require ID but not all. The choice is yours on that one.)<br />4. Select the store you wish to deposit your money at.<br />5. Either print out or copy down the info provided by the downloadable form.<br />6. Head to that location, fill out the moneygram form with the info from the bitinstant form, and deposit your $.<br /><br /><br />Once all that is taken care of it&#039;s just a matter of waiting for your coins to reach your account and you&#039;re all&nbsp; set. :)Hope this info helps and if I left anything out feel free to correct me everyone.

				Bitinstant is getting very, VERY dumb.&nbsp; They&#039;ll be requiring personal information soon (official announcement) and they&#039;ve been messing up big time.<br /><br />Look up BlueSkyTraders on SR and there will be a link to their new business page (.onion).&nbsp; You can check loads of other people on the forums who say the same, always the way to go.&nbsp; Quick, anonymous, and cheap.&nbsp; The only hold up is-they only take deposits from Bank of America.&nbsp; So you have to be in America.<br /><br />~ST

				When I used the site a few weeks ago they required real info as they are now checking identity. If you go to Walmart for the moneygram they dont ID and are generally chill. <br /><br />My latest order was fucked up. First it failed for no apparent reason, then when I got customer support to help me, they sent it to the wrong bitcoin address, and then claimed that the bitcoin was lost and once they send it they cannot get it back. Thats very poor service, a good company would have sent me my coin after verifying the address I entered in the order anyway, bitinstant has millions of coins. I did eventually get my coins a few weeks later after forgetting about the whole thing, which was great, but now I dont want to use them.
