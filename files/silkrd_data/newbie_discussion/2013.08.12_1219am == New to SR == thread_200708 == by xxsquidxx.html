				Welcome and here&#039;s some tips I learnt in my short stay here:<br /><br />Don&#039;t trust no one<br />Anyone can be a cop<br />Never finalize early<br />Use tails, whonix and a VPN to be decently secured<br /><br />and most importantly , try not to spend all your money here.

				Complete and true anonymity is close to impossible but doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t do everything you can especially in these times. But as a beginner to start off I&#039;d say download and install Tails onto a USB and use that and a VPN never hurts just to hide the fact from your ISP that your using ToR. Never know how closely they work with LE. For all we know they&#039;re could be a backdoor in every ISP that sends traffic logs to the FBI or NSA. Crazier shit has happened. Ok now that I&#039;m done with the fear mongering a good place to read up is on the security forums. Some really smart people there and some not so much.<br /><br />Oh the other really really vital thing is never send your address unencrypted which I assume you won&#039;t cause you know of PGP. Buying Bitcoins is not as easy as it once was but still safe ways to get them. Keep in mind that in the SR wiki they don&#039;t advise buying Bitcoins from vendors on SR. I think it all depends on the vendor but it can still be risky. If your a small buyer you can setup through coinbase. You should be ready to trade in a few days once you attach your bank account. If your spending like $100/wk I don&#039;t think it&#039;s too sketchy. If anyone ever asks you bought something for your computer. Also where you hide the drugs is important too. Sometimes the best place to hide them is the most obvious. Hope that helps let me know if you have any questions!

				Best advice is to read through the forums, learn as much about SR as you can. I have been here several weeks and have only scratched the surface.&nbsp; Don&#039;t expect others to hold your hand and spoon feed you. You will learn quicker if you do your own legwork.<br /><br />Then start looking through the listings of stuff for sale, check out the different types of vendors in all categories, learn what to expect. You will minimize your chances of being scammed if you establish a relationship with a few vendors you trust.<br /><br />Start with small orders, finalize promptly and provide a review of the product. Until you have built up a book of ordering history, you might want to use newer vendors. Don&#039;t FE, there are new vendors coming in all the time. <br /><br />Start reading and learning, then you can help others. SR is a big community and we share information on these boards, so post when you can. <br /><br />Enjoy!!

				-Research as much as possible. (Both vendors and how to do things.)<br />-Start with small orders.<br />-Use PGP/GPG<br />-Be courteous and treat the sellers with respect and they should do the same for you.<br /><br />-Have fun!
