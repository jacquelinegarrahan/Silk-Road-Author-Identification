				I&#039;ve been here a long time. Now I noticed that I can&#039;t write to the forums anymore. It&#039;s the newbiw thing.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll write here.<br /><br />Just got CC&#039;s speed and it actually just kicked in. Wow, I feel like coming home. It&#039;s again best and the purest old school speed here. Definitely over 90%. I bombed something like two matchstick size lines. It&#039;s probably too much for speed newbies, but it&#039;s normal lunch for me. <br /><br />It gives very good motivated happy feeling. And right now the new QOTSA album sounds killer ha ha! <br /><br />CC also is very good at communication. Fast and friendy. <br /><br />It&#039;s good that he doesn&#039;t have active listings all around the year. It would kill me :D<br /><br />Hell fuckin yeah. 5+/5.

				Hmm, i just put in my first order from CC, and this review makes me pretty excited.<br /><br />I have recently had a few orders from BM and i have saved a little, so i think it will be exciting to compare the two against each other, as the general consensus seem to be that these are the 2 go to guys for speed.<br />

				Thought i would throw a review of CC&#039;s amphetamine sulphate in this thread.<br /><br />I received in ~a week, which i consider pretty good from South Africa to Northern EU.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t need to communicate with the vendor, so i cant really comment on his coms.<br /><br />The product was a peachy color, and it had that familiar speed smell, but the smell wasn&#039;t nearly as strong as a lot of other products i have tried, which i consider a good thing as pure speed actually doesn&#039;t smell.<br /><br />In my previous post i said that BM and CC seemed to be &quot;the go to guys&quot; for speed, but in my opinion CC&#039;s product is actually cleaner than BM&#039;s.<br />I am basing this on the fact that CC&#039;s doesn&#039;t give me the same body-jitters that i got from the last batch i recieved from BM (This was the yellow waxy batch).<br /><br />The product is very potent, and perfect for my purpose (I mainly use speed to enhance focus when i am doing academic work, or need to write, read for extended periods of time).<br /><br />Furthermore it doesn&#039;t sting as much in the nose as BM&#039;s did (Of course it can be felt, and it is not pleasant, but the discomfort as gone within ~30 seconds), and there is no residue left in the nasal cavities, even after doing several bumps (i only do small bumps ~20 mg, or so).<br /><br />All in all, i think that the only reason i will not be using CC as my regular supplier, is that i am a little fishy about ordering from S. Africa to often.<br /><br />I think my next order is going to be from iisthisisi, because he seems to know his stuff, and the meth he had a few months ago, was completely mindblowing (even under 400x magnification it was clear as glass), and i am hoping that his amphetamine sulphate is around the same quality...<br />

				I think it&#039;s fishier to have ONE parcel from Nederlands than TEN from South Africa.<br />BM is considered top notch but reading a page with independent analysis I noticed a sample was &quot;only&quot; 50ish% pure, no active cuts anyway. Other than that single one all on 70/80&gt;&gt;% so maybe it&#039;s just an unlucky batch.
