				I&#039;ve been a user of SR for about a year now. In that time I&#039;ve made about 5 orders of 25i- and 25c-NBOME (give or take) from Nevita. Barring one time when my country&#039;s postal service was striking for 2 months, every order he as sent has arrived within 4 weeks. Quite a feat for Spain -&gt; South Africa.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never ordered from Nevita without him putting in at least 10% extra in the order. Even my very first order had a few bonus tabs in. Also, through about 600 tabs of psychedelic, I&#039;ve yet to find a bunk tab, one that didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Plus, stealth shipping is A+. Awesome experiences with this dude, and I highly recommend him.<br /><br />edit: forgot to add I recently placed another order with him. Will update here when it arrives.<br /><br />

				I picked up some of Nevita&#039;s 25C and everything went great. I received a response within minutes of sending a PM so zero issues with the communications. <br /><br />This has to be one of the best shipping methods I have seen on the Road. There are a few added touches they use that others overlook. Every legitimate item I buy online comes with additional paperwork and glad to see this was included. It is this sort of added touch that allows for the shipments from Spain to easily pass through customs. Most vendors that ship products like this go with discreet shipping and do not bother with stealth at all. <br /><br />The 25C-nbome fucking rocks. If you need to see your surroundings in a whole different way this is how it&#039;s done. Hard to believe the price you pay to go for such a ride. Friends are blown away when I pass these out having no idea just how cheap these are. Less than a dollar for a trip like this is probably the best deal going. Nev seems to be very generous to repeat customers and throws in extras after you are a proven customer. <br /><br />The shipping times have varied a bit, but this is Spain after all. I have received some of the shipments to Texas in 7 days total and other times over two weeks. Well worth the wait. Hard to believe the beating their ratings took over a short period but things are running smoothly again.<br /><br />KCCO&nbsp; :o
