				Guys, this is actually a pretty good deal. I know, OPs suck. Oral Oxycodone is a top tier opiate. Let one of these fuckers sit in some water for about 24 hours and you have 80mg of IR Oxycodone at less than half the price of roxies. I&#039;m not speaking for this vendor, I don&#039;t know shit about him. I&#039;m speaking for the product.

				I go through OxycontinKing (about 33.50 per pill):&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ce6bac9e45&nbsp; ... You have to order 10 but he is a SOLID AS FUCK vender.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak highly enough about this guy (stealth/shipping time/communication is all 6 out of 5).&nbsp; His last day shipping is going to be the 28th so get them while they&#039;re hot. Usually when people order 10 he will send 11.<br /><br />***I know how to alter oxycontin OP&#039;s in about 5-10 minutes so you can snort them**&nbsp; A friend told me the other day he used the same method to IV them in the past but that sounds sketchy to me + I&#039;ve never IV&#039;d anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you guy&#039;s would like to know more just post back in here.&nbsp; I&#039;d be more than happy to share.&nbsp; It is a bit of a pain in the butt, but it is worth it and you get 99% of the pill... first time I did it was with an OP40 and I thought it would be like snorting 15-30mg of oxycodone IR, assuming some would be lost in the process.. I was wrong, it was like snorting 40mg of oxy... shit got me fucked up.&nbsp; After I&#039;ve shown people how to do it, they never go back to eating them. <br /><br />-Bill Paxton

				Please share Bill, I would love to hear it! The water method that I use is obviously pointless in comparison if what you say it is true.

And yes, this does work, I&#039;ve done it multiple times, also I have witnessed/coached other people through it and I&#039;ve only had one mishap which I will explain.<br /><br />What you need:&nbsp; 1. Razor blade.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Oven safe cookware (I like using pyrex oven safe glass cookware myself) 3. Oven. 4. Freezer. 5. dry dish rag or towel.<br /><br />Cut your pill up into REALLY small little bits/slices after licking the coating off.&nbsp; I don&#039;t suggest washing it off in the sink as I&#039;ve seen/heard of people loosing them down the drain + if you lick it off you get a little bit of the oxy in your system that way. The best thing to do is to put it on your glass cookware and just start slicing it into the smallest pieces you can get.&nbsp; After you&#039;ve cut the whole thing up into bits make sure they are all separated on the glass so they are not touching but are close together.&nbsp; Go back through with your razor and try to half all the small pieces again (this is just to get them even smaller)... You can&#039;t get the pieces small enough IMO. <br /><br />Pre-heat your oven to a high temp.&nbsp; I usually go to 450 but I&#039;ve seen plenty of people do it on broil as they don&#039;t like to wait as long.<br /><br />Make sure that all the pieces are not touching but keep them close together. You should have a little collection of pieces about the size of a silver dollar or so.&nbsp; These should be on your glass cookware that you&#039;re going to put in the oven and I suggest doing all the slicing on the glass so you keep everything together.<br /><br />Put your pill in the oven (Its scary putting a 25-50 dollar pill into a blazing hot oven but just trust me) after its pre-heated.<br /><br />&nbsp;**Stand by the oven during this part, DO NOT WALK AWAY (Its easy to get distracted especially if you&#039;re already fucked up)** All ovens are different when it comes to temp unless you have a newer oven with a digital read-out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done this with temp below 400 so again, I suggest doing it at 450 or even at broil.&nbsp; The cooking phase does not take very long at all, about 3-8 minutes.&nbsp; You want to make sure you keep a close eye on everything during this part as **Its the only part in the process where you can fuck up**.&nbsp; If you have an oven light, use it.&nbsp; Otherwise you want to keep checking your pill every minute or so after its been in there for about 2-3 minutes.&nbsp; It does let the heat out/slow the process everytime you open the oven door so make sure you&#039;re not opening it like every 20-30 seconds... I usually check it about every 60 seconds, sometimes more often.&nbsp; What you&#039;re looking for is the white bits of your pill to begin to melt down into flatter globs.&nbsp; They slowly loose their jagged shapes and start sinking down sort of like silly puttee.&nbsp; After the bits melt down and start to flatten out you&#039;ll notice that they start to change from a white to an amber brown.&nbsp; You want to keep them in there until they turn a rather dark brown but you don&#039;t want to burn them.&nbsp; The best way I can describe it is right about when you start to think you&#039;re going to burn up your pill, take it out.&nbsp; If you have cook hands or are comfortable touching something thats kinda hot the best thing to do is gently press into one of the melted globs with your finger, it will feel gel-like/smushy.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you want&nbsp; the color of your pill pieces to be&nbsp; an amber brown at.&nbsp; Think amber brown as opposed to a blondish-brown or a dark brown.&nbsp; Blondish/light brown means its not quite there yet, dark dark brown means you probably cooked it too long.&nbsp; There is not exact science to this so having some cooking experience helps for sure.<br /><br />Keep in mind if you cook your pill too much, or not enough, you can simply eat the thing. The only way you can completely fuck yourself out&nbsp; of a pill is if you put it in the oven and forget about it.&nbsp; What I mean is if you leave it in the oven and completely burn the living shit out of it, you will be fucked.&nbsp; This is why I say its very very important to stand next to the oven the entire time so you don&#039;t get distracted/forget its in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />After your pill pieces have melted down they should be a nice dark amber brown but not burnt.&nbsp; Again, you can press into a piece with your finger or use a toothpick and it should be really gummy feeling (some will stick to your toothpick or finger) and flattened out for the most part looking like a drop of syrup on a plate but not that liquid-ish.&nbsp; I say better safe than sorry so keep checking that oven every 30-45 seconds; after they start to melt down and turn brown, they will get to that nice amber brown color fairly quickly especially if you have it on broil. <br /><br />Place a dry dish cloth or towel in your freezer. You&#039;re going to pull the pyrex glass out of the oven and put it directly into the freezer onto the dry rag. DO NOT put it in on a bunch of cold plastic/food/ice etc as it will make the glass explode... The only time I saw this go badly was when somebody didn&#039;t use a towel and their whole pyrex glass bakeware shattered into about 15 pieces (The pills were still salvaged). <br /><br />You can leave it in the freezer as long as you want; you can&#039;t really over-do this part.&nbsp; After about 10-15 minutes the whole glass piece will be cold and the little globs of amber brown pills will be hardened back up and stuck to the glass in little melted lumps. You may need to take a paper towel to the glass to get rid of moisture that has collected/stuck to the glass when you pull it out. but make sure its totally cold/frozen or you&#039;ll wipe gooey pill bits off onto the towel.&nbsp; Do this while pieces are still stuck (dry off the glass that is)<br /><br />Take your razor again (I learned this part on my own) and go back over the (now hard) pieces, cutting them into little tiny tiny pieces.&nbsp; Do this while they&#039;re stuck in their little frozen globs to the glass.&nbsp; If you scrape them all loose then try to slice them up more it will be very difficult.&nbsp; I&#039;ll slice one glob like 3-5 times horizontally then vertically while they&#039;re stuck.&nbsp; They stay in place (stuck to the glass and hardened) so it makes this part very easy.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve gotten the pieces scored/chopped up as best you can, go ahead and carefully scrape them off the glass with the razor blade and make yourself a nice fat line. I make mine on the glass, no reason to put it anywhere else.. Keep in mind no matter how small you cut everything they are still going to be in small junks, you can never get the stuff to turn into powder form.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you go to snort your line(s) it will look as if you&#039;re snorting a bunch of little booger&#039;s off a plate. Again, you can&#039;t really get them small enough... Give it a good strong snort and yak that shit up your nose to the back of your throat.&nbsp; What you&#039;ve snorted will dissolve VERY quickly in your nasal cavity/receptors to the point that when you get a drip it will be running down your throat like a syrupy pill.&nbsp; You may get a gakker or two of the chunks but just cowboy up and do it.<br /><br />Everybody who&#039;s done this has been pleasantly shocked at how well it works.&nbsp; Be prepared for a bit of a burn and some extra post-line snorting to get all the bits far up your nose/to the back of your throat.&nbsp; It will taste very similar to an old OC but not exactly the same.<br /><br />Keep in mind like I said before, if you don&#039;t cook the pill long enough, or if you cook it a little too long, just let it cool off in the freezer (using a towel), scrape it off the glass and eat it (which is what you were going to do with it in the first place). The only time I&#039;ve seen somebody totally fuck themselves is when they&#039;ve&nbsp; put their cut up pill in the oven and completely forgotten about it only to come back to black charred shit.<br /><br />Slicing the hardened frozen globs while they&#039;re stuck to the glass (after the freezer) makes it waaay easier to get them into very small pieces. <br /><br />OK thats it, I know its a long read and I could have explained things in a shorter more precise manner but I&#039;ve never written this down before + 3am my time and I&#039;m pretty tired. <br /><br />I&#039;ll try to answer any questions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this with OP40&#039;s and OP80&#039;s<br /><br />-Bill Paxton

				I&#039;m not just replying for the 50 post count thing, but thank you for that. I was not expecting you to type out that much. I&#039;ve copied it and saved it for later use. I have used a similar method with a Microwave and I feel as if I got absolutely nothing out of it. Have you tried the Microwave method of this crisping tek and if so how does it compare to your oven method?

				No I have not tried a microwave.<br /><br />Based on what I know about cooking in general I&#039;m of the opinion that an oven is the way to go and would avoid using a microwave. <br /><br />&nbsp;If its a microwave or nothing I would go with nothing and just eat the thing. Letting it disolve in your mouth after biting/cutting it into tiny pieces will make the pill hit you in 10-30 minutes.&nbsp; I would never just swallow an OP whole unless taking it on an empty stomach. <br /><br />The oven/freeezer method works VERY well.&nbsp; The first time I did it I had already railed 60mg IR oxycodone before my friend showed me how to cook off a 40op.. Thinking that the 40 would be fairly weak, if it would work at all, I snorted the whole thing and proceeded to get too fucked up to drive.&nbsp; Snorting 40mg using this method is like... snorting 40mg :) ... you may loose like 5-10% of the pill if that.
