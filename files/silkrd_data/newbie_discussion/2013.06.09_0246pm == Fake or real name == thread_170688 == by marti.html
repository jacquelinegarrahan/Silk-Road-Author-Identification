				real name with no signature. Just deny everything if something goes south. If available order with DCN, which is available in US and some parts of EU.

				Nice, thank you :D<br />The part of no signature it&#039;s important I guess, so if I sign I say that I was expecting that. But is possible that sometimes the signature is compulsory?

				Real name. You can&#039;t stop people sending you stuff through the post. Like the ricin sent to Barak Obama. I&#039;m sure he didn&#039;t order that. Of course if he did, he may have addressed it to Dubya lol

				Depending on your jurisdiction, things are different. I&#039;m from the US, so I&#039;ll give you my opinion. Always use your real name and always sign for the package. It looks more suspicious if you randomly decide to deny a package instead of just signing for it. Even when I get packages that I&#039;m expecting that require signatures, I don&#039;t even look at it before signing it and taking it inside. If it&#039;s from a return address I don&#039;t recognize (i.e. from SR) I write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on it and place it somewhere near my from door. I wait a while before opening it. If LE busts down my door, there&#039;s still a sealed box with a clear intent to return it to the sender (implying that I don&#039;t want it and it isn&#039;t mine). &quot;I thought it was a care package from aunt Susie when I signed for it, but I saw the return address and realized I made a mistake. I was about to take it back to the post office to have it returned.&quot; Signing for a packing (as far as I know) doesn&#039;t imply that you recognize the sender and accept the contents, it just means that you verified the delivery. A package that does not require a signature has an implicit acceptance of delivery and you might as well have signed for it too. I once signed for a package that I knew was from SR at the main branch of the post office in my city and nobody batted an eye at me.

I apologize, I was definitely wrong. The best thing to say is nothing. However, your lawyer can say that you had no idea it was from someone you didn&#039;t know. But seriously people, don&#039;t say anything until you have a lawyer. The only possible exception to this rule would be, &quot;can I see the search warrant please&quot;. Although one thing to note, you shouldn&#039;t answer their questions or offer explanations even with a lawyer, let the lawyer do all of the talking. Unless you are subpoena&#039;d to reveal information, let the lawyer&#039;s expensive mouth say every word.<br /><br />I got convicted once because of my dumb mouth said something stupid that I shouldn&#039;t have. It was the only real evidence they had and it was all they needed to convict me.

By signing a package you will only complicate things. Why you put yourself into situation where you have to explain yourself, if you can have total deniability? Point is: if ordering drugs, do it with DCN - its good for you, as you know where you package is and for the vendor also. If you sign the package, then even in the best scenario you will have to get a lawyer which will cost you money and all this because you wanted to argue, that you dont know nothing.<br /><br />I have been ordering on SR for over 6 months and i NEVER use signature, only DCN - to get a guarantee that the package was sent and it wount be stolen by postman/postwoman.<br /><br />Of course you can always sign, if you want to see some action, but im my opinion it will cost you more money and time arguing. We try to be smart here, so dont give advice which will get people either in trouble OR they will have to spend money on lawyers.

				Signing for a package (usually) won&#039;t impact your need for a lawyer. If LE is out for you, they&#039;ll get you, signature or not. Having drugs delivered to your door will get you a visit from the police whether you sign for the package or not, and now you still need a lawyer. The fact of the matter is, once you&#039;ve been discovered, you&#039;re in need a lawyer. Simple as that.

				This is from a recent post from a postal worker which verifies what we always believed;<br />(good read)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0<br /><br />- Use real names! Our policy is to return mail that is not addressed to the occupant on file of a particular address, unless it&#039;s a known forward. So, if your carrier is doing what he&#039;s being paid to do, he will return a mail piece addressed to a a fake name every time. Yes, sometimes they deliver it anyway. Sometimes it&#039;s a sub on the route that doesn&#039;t give a shit. But bad names are supposed to go back.<br /><br /><br /><br />So you will increase the odds of it not showing up if you decide to use a fake name.<br /><br />NCK
