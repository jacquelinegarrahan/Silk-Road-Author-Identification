				I&#039;m a bit confused as to my pgp and how its integrated into forum listings. It&#039;s all set up fine now, I have a working public key and have added a few people successfully and emailed them. Is you public key something you give a user not really on your listing description, or usually only after they have messaged you about your listed product in private messages?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Yes, you can post your public key in your listings. Then when someone sends a message to you they can use your public key to encrypt, and you use your private key to decrypt. It&#039;s a highly secure method of communicating, and keeps any potential prying eyes out of your business.

				PGP is a great way to keep sensitive information secure, however, it is not necessary for simple messages.&nbsp; If a potential buyer has a question or comment, they can message you.&nbsp; I trust Silk Road&#039;s encryption service as is for nonsensitive information.<br />DMTElf, PGP encryption is normally used for buyers to send you their address.&nbsp; (Address, inlcuding name, is very sensitive information.)&nbsp; Even then, it is not necessary to require PGP encryption for addresses.&nbsp; It is your call there.&nbsp; Also, welcome to the Road!

				Many vendors say in their profile that they will cancel any orders placed without PGP encryption so that is perfectly fine to do. Just say that you are going to do so in your vendor&#039;s profile.
