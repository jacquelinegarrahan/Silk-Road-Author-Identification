				Thank you for your answers. I&#039;ll find out about all these products. That said, I doubt that LSD is good for what I want! In addition, I panic and I fear very quickly. For example, smoking just a little bit too much grass is dangerous for me. Thanks again, i keep an eye on this post.

				d-amphetamine is the best from my experiences.&nbsp; However, if you are working public then definitely Methamphetamine.&nbsp; (reduces anxiety)&nbsp; I assume though that you are just doing a small study dose in which case I would still say meth is better for public working but you&#039;ll be fine on something like adderall still.

It&#039;ll also boost your working memory and some other intellectual abilities.<br /><br />Adderall is pharmaceutical grade/quantity of amphetamine. It shall improve your ability to concentrate.<br /><br />Together, the drugs shall improve your work output by a factor of 2 or 4 times. The disadvantage is that you&#039;ll need a day off some time later, you cannot continue such a regime indefinitely.<br /><br />Knowing the half life is important. For Modafinil it is 12-15 hours. For Adderall it is 10 - 13 hours. <br /><br />For peak efficiency, you need to set a clock to keep a consistent amount of Modafinil and Adderall in your system, so that you are not in any danger of taking too much, and so the effects don&#039;t tail off. Ideally you should factor your age/body-weight into the calculations to refine them.<br /><br />Modafinil and Adderall are examples of Nootropics. Drugs used to make you smarter, in the same way steroids are used by weight lifters to build muscle. It works, but if you don&#039;t follow the rules you&#039;ll pay for it with your health. e.g. do not drink alcohol before, during or after taking these drugs. Do not work for 72 hours in a row and then wonder WTF happened. Don&#039;t mix recreational use of drugs with nootropic usage. Working 24+ hours in a row is permitable, but after you must rest and let the drugs leave your system, ideally two days of normal work and good sleep.<br /><br />A normal dose for Moda is 200mg. I take 100mg usually myself, I find I don&#039;t need a higher dosage.<br /><br />A normal dose for Addy is 40mg. <br /><br />You should carry a notebook and record all the data available to you, as well as your experiences, you&#039;ve got to be scientific about this if you&#039;re to maximize the potential. Otherwise you&#039;re throwing good money, and your health if you&#039;re just being silly, down the drain.

				Oh, and talk to Tryptamine. Tryptamine is SR&#039;s main nootropic geek and vendor. The nootropic products are mostly legal or prescription, just either hard to source or a pain to collect from different sources.<br /><br />Methamphetamine was used as a work drug in the old days, but the doses weren&#039;t remotely close to what they are for recreational purposes, plus they were pharmaceutical grade. I definitely do not recommend it as a nootropic, it&#039;s practically the opposite of a nootropic. Chemically speaking it&#039;s like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, it&#039;s just too much. Productivity results are very mixed, for some it is great, for others its useless.<br /><br />As for cocaine, it gives you confidence, not efficiency or clarity, it&#039;s more like a nootropic placebo. Moda and Addy are used by airplane pilots, university researchers, soliders, students, you name it, they do work. I recommend buying as much Adderall as you can get your hands on, not just because of the nootropic advantage, but because judging from the way the DEA is acting, they&#039;d like to ban it, so it tends to be expensive and will probably become very expensive.

Productivity results are very mixed, for some it is great, for others its useless.<br /><br />As for cocaine, it gives you confidence, not efficiency or clarity, it&#039;s more like a nootropic placebo. Moda and Addy are used by airplane pilots, university researchers, soliders, students, you name it, they do work. I recommend buying as much Adderall as you can get your hands on, not just because of the nootropic advantage, but because judging from the way the DEA is acting, they&#039;d like to ban it, so it tends to be expensive and will probably become very expensive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Merci, Pine for all ur advise, thank dissolvedgirl. Yep cocaine, it&#039;s not realy the best, I tried to write with today, and&nbsp; it&#039;s not good, the mind is not clear. Maybe it is not a good cocaine. But I will follow your advice with Adderall and Modafinil. I do not need to write 20 or 70 hours in a row, no, just 8 hours by day (I am very lazy) this is very good. I write novels, novels about simple people and simple stories. After nine novels, I still have things to say, but I do not have the strength, courage, and I no longer believe too, maby because my life is not very exciting, life of single. (I explain, that all, do not cry on me :-).)&nbsp; So, maby i need less than ur dose... i take a look on these produces. Thanks again.

				Depending on what you do, and if&nbsp; you have the money, Coke could be nice. However it is really euphoric and to keep a constant buzz it will take constant redosing until you are off work.<br /><br />I would say taking a 30mg cap of Adderal XR, and maybe a 10mg-20mg IR booster halfway through your shift.

				Adderall is great, but Methylphenidate(Dopamine-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor rather than an amphetamine, same mechanism as cocaine which is a triple reuptake inhibitor) works quite well too.<br /><br />Methylphenidate gives you the same &quot;focused&quot; feeling as cocaine as well as the energy, but without the &quot;Fuck yeah, I feel great&quot; feeling and lack of inhibition. It&#039;s also cheap, which is good.<br /><br />Although I have to agree with what people have already said here, adderall is probably the best. I&#039;m going to stockpile some myself as it looks like countries might start banning it soon, fucking fascists.

				Generic dexedrine (basically Adderal, but cheaper and generic)<br />I think William Burroughs, Jack Keroac, I think Ken Kesey probably just used LSD and peyote and didn&#039;t write while on those. People could used to buy Vicks inhalers you could use to unroll these nose things (not drops I think) and&nbsp; you could use that.

				Amphetamine, specifically Adderall. Meth is just too distracting for me (being too pleasurable), and it&#039;s relatively easy to get as far as drugs go. You can get instant release or time release in a variety of dosages to suit your needs (and tolerance level).
