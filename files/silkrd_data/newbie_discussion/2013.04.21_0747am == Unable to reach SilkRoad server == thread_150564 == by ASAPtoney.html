				i couldnt connect all day yesterday late last night i was on for a while before i lost it again, now today it keeps timing out. Some might call me a druggy so i get anxiety when my money and drugs are not flowing smooth, so im upset i cant connect. Only been on the road a couple months and have never had probs not connecting for hours at a time like this.

				I&#039;m able to connect with no errors, but it has been incredibly slow the past few days (blame 420 traffic... :P ). I&#039;m sure high traffic can bog down connections, or even halt them, so I would try logging on different times of the day to see if it helps, because the website is definitely up, just very, very slow ATM.

				I havent really been able to get on all day either. I got the connection and the main page to come up, and I went and folded my laundry, then came back and one image was loaded. I went and made lunch and came back and the rest of the images were loaded. <br /><br />Its taking a long while. Very very slow, but able to get a connection. Figured maybe my link was broken and I was getting a spammer site, but verified it (through this post, thanks!) <br /><br />Guess this just means I need to get out from behind my computer for a while....
