				Copied over from the non-newbie thread about chemicalsisters:<br /><br />Here&#039;s my review:<br /><br />Order: 5g mdma<br />Price: $110 ?!<br />Communication: A++ Responses within a few hours to my questions.<br />Shipping time: 6 days to East Coast US!!!!<br />Stealth: Blended in with regular mail and was vacuum sealed.&nbsp; About on par with other shipments from the road, but nothing too exciting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve definitely seen better and worse but no complaints here.<br />Weight on arrival: 5.05g<br />Description: Brownish crystals and powder.&nbsp; Crystals were around 1 g each for the largest ones.<br />Quality: Unfortunately I don&#039;t have a marquis/reagent test right now, and I might get drug tested for work so I can&#039;t do a personal test.&nbsp; The residue off the bag tastes how it should though, bitter chemical taste.&nbsp; I have no reason to doubt that this is mdma, but unfortunately I can&#039;t give a detailed trip report or quality test.&nbsp; I may have a guinea pig to test things out tomorrow, if they decide to take it I&#039;ll post an update to the thread.<br /><br />Overall: 8/5.&nbsp; Extra point for price, shipping time, and communication.&nbsp; I consider a 5/5 a good vendor, so an 8/5 is amazing!&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely do business with chemicalsisters again, and as long as the quality pans out they&#039;ve got a lifetime buyer!<br /><br />thunderstruck

				They weren&#039;t pure white, but had a brown/tan tint to them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve crushed everything up into powder already, but looking back at the product it actually looks more white than I remember it being before I crushed it up.&nbsp; Everything looks on par with product I&#039;ve had before so no complaints here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never gotten the truly brown crystals from people like juergen but I have seen pictures and it was nothing like that.&nbsp; The product looked like their picture on silkroad.<br /><br />thunderstruck
