				Anyone have any experience with his new batch?&nbsp; His price for 10g went to $250 and the feedback is that it&#039;s grey powder, so I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s something up with it. He&#039;s a trusted dealer but just wondering if anyone has tried. And I need to get to 50 posts.

				i dont know if this stuff is similar but stuff ive had in the past starts off a orangey mauve translucent colour and if you keep it for a long while it turns translucent grey but this is in crystal form if you powder it it looks more white than anything but this stuff i had was really good probably the most potent ive had, and being old didnt change its properties only its colour but like i say it only appeared this colour in its crystal form and the very fine powder that stuck to the bag literally micrograms you could barely see it i licked it and 15 mins later felt my eyes widen a bit like i say was really potent stuff but i get this off a friend not on sr

				Sukey has some really good product (cocaine) that is tested in the top 3. I glanced and the molly on SR and you get anything from deep amber crystals, to White and grey ( marbling ). But I understand what you are saying, if it is still the same price of&nbsp; B 2.5951 for 10 grams. I have started numerous threads about crystal color and purity and how it effects the trip. I honestly think the amber coloring and grey specs in the moon rocks are INACTIVE residual chemicals that did not fully get cleansed / washed out. Pharmaceutical molly should be white and odorless. My theory is that its difficult to get hands on top notch precursors in volume. Even though the MDMA is tested at 84% pure, chemists are having to use alternative routes to synthesize MDA --&gt; MDMA and it doesn&#039;t seem as euphoric or moving as the MDMA back when it was legal and the government was pressing pills of ecstasy.<br /><br />Also it can be about experience, set or setting. So many factors. But thats a good flip around if you go with Sukey&#039;s 10g deal on amber dutch rocks.
