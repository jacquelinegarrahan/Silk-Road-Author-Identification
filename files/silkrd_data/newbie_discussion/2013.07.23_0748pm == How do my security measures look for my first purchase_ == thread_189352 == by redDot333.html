				So I am successfully using TAILs now which automatically has to use TOR.&nbsp; I dont have persistant volume set up but i dont need anything saved each time I use TAILs.&nbsp; I aquired my bitcoins threw a cash deposit at a local bank where i didnt have to show ID at all and they are now being transferred from localbitcoins to bitcoinfog.&nbsp; I am doing a few different deposits and withdraws to and from bitcoinfog then onto the SR wallet next.&nbsp; I am obviously going to use the sellers private key when giving him my address to ship my order.&nbsp; Mind you I am using my own computer and from my home network.&nbsp; Is there any security measures I should use besides these? such as a public wifi network or a VPN?<br /><br />Still trying to figure this whole thing out, but i think i understand it for the most part.&nbsp; mind you this is just a relatively small order for personel use and some friends.<br /><br />if you can think of anything else I should try or use please let me know and thanks so much

				The only other measure I would take to add to what you have already done, which is slightly more then even I do, would be using a different network. I&#039;m often on random networks when using SR, purchasing coin etc.

				I do two things differently; I don&#039;t go to a bank to buy bitcoins, I use either coinbase or bitinstant and then send them through a couple bitcoin wallets and I use a persistent volume with a 35 character passphrase.

If you are smart you&#039;ll try to make as few trails as possible and have your entire history blank if ever a day a postal inspector knocks on your door and a task force knocks 30 seconds late. Never leaving your computer running with anything incriminating on it as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so i have a paper trail from this even though i used localbitcoins, deposited into someone else&#039;s account, not revealing my name or anything(i didnt even drive there so no liscense plate #), just deposited straight into his account and then the bitcoins were in my localbitcoin wallet?&nbsp; Just trying to figure this all out the best I can before first purchase<br /><br />thanks for the help to everyone, classic newb not knowin shit

I alternate between a few shipping addresses though.<br />monday order = house #1. wed order = house #2. friday order = house #3. repeat.
