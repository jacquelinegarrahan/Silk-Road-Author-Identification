				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Quick question- It is my first time on SR and I ordered from a vendor named BlackMail. I sent a message (PGP of course) regarding his product and shipping practices as some feedback had said stealth could be improved. I also placed an order for 1g of bth. Being new to this process I am wandering if I should have heard anything back? or if anyone else has any experience with BMail? He had a rating of 94, but a lot of good feedback. Depending on the remainder of the transaction I may go elsewhere. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I like to get to talk and receive message from vendor first, before i place an order. Is your order in transit. It will say that on your order page. If it still says processing, don&#039;t worry. Alot of vendors are hit with alot of orders a day, and can&#039;t get yours out the same day you ordered. Wait a couple of days, and if you don&#039;t hear back, then send him a polite pm wondering what is going on with your order.

				Agree with dolphy - in my experience so far, anything up to 48 hours or so isn&#039;t too unusual. I&#039;ve also found that some vendors are known for turning orders around very quickly. I&#039;ve had an order acknowledged and marked In Transit in less than an hour, and it did ship that same day. It&#039;s typical in my experience for a vendor to mark In Transit as soon as they begin their own process, not necessarily when it ships. This is fine, as it serves as a way for the vendor to keep things straight themselves.<br /><br />And it bears repeating for anyone making their first order: Never FE! You may choose to do so in the future if you become a regular with a vendor, but even that can be risky, as you never truly know the vendor&#039;s circumstances. Have fun and be safe!

				Thanks for the reply 77. It has now been 48 hours so I sent a polite message inquiring about the availability of my order. I haven&#039;t received any reply. Blackmail&#039;s profile says he hasn&#039;t logged in in over 2 days. I&#039;m not mad or dope sick just have a celebration this weekend and wanted some product. I have some more $ headed to the Rd, but now I kind of want my funds out of escrow to have more to spend. If anyone has any advice please share.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />BWT

				BTH? Don&#039;t know what it is, but right after i posted this i was looking at a vendors page that i ordered from a few weeks that says they have this blacktarheroin(figured it out while typing). He\she specifically says that they don&#039;t require fe of new vendors. They have a good rating too. Btw, that order i did with them was for a free 5 8mg sample giveaway of suboxone. All i had to do was pay postage, so i figured what the hell, why not. I had only very vaguely heard of it before. Anyway, to sum it up, i thought i was getting some cheap opiates. Boy was i wrong! Lol. Not vendors fault of course. Check him/her out.

				Hey Dolphy, yes the acronym for BTH is correct. I&#039;m checking Seneca out right now. I will probably give him a try. As for Bmail, it now shows he logged in, but did not respond. Another day and a half and I can cancel the order unless he does first. Thanks for the help.
