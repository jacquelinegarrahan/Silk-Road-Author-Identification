				I was just thinking. If you could travel back in time a couple decades and explain the concept of SR to people.. they&#039;d have stared at you in disbelief. What do you think we&#039;ll have in the future, say, 20 years FROM now?

				I think that in another twenty years we&#039;ll be getting high digitally. As we decode the language of the brain and develop more powerful ways of interacting directly with computers, we&#039;ll be able to run virtual reality programs that stimulate our neurons in ways that recreate the same psychoactive effects we now rely on chemicals to achieve. The first digital drugs will probably be shitty compared to what they mimic, sort of like research chemicals, but over time the ability to directly code someone&#039;s neurochemistry with increasing specificity and granularity will allow people to download any drug in existence.<br /><br />The level of control such a system could possibly allow might give rise to new drugs, digital hybrids that synthesize the effects of many existing drugs. Entirely new experiences might also arise, virtual drugs whose real-life analogs don&#039;t yet exist or which might be impossible to produce IRL. Such drugs might even push the boundaries of what the human psyche cam take. DMT-like trips that stretch over several subjective lifetimes. Double lives split between the real world and carefully choreographed dissociative fantasies where you can be anyone or anything you can imagine.&nbsp; Oracle-like states of ecstasy that allow groups of people to transcend their egos and become collective beings whose increased processing power elevates them to levels of genius impossible when they were trapped in single brains. <br /><br />A self-assembling viral drug will eventually emerge on some future analog of the darknet, mutating with each mind it touches. With each hit the whole of human feeling and experience becomes available to the user. Some are left burnt-our mental husks, robotic shadows of themselves. Others will be transformed into something beyond our imagining. Alien, outside of our moral and conceptual systems. Superior beings, to be sure, but neither good nor evil. Made&nbsp; an apotheosis of themselves through direct contact with the all, pure abstraction, like arch-angels or demi-urges.<br /><br />Or something. Great thread idea colorblack!

				Interesting insight Strangeman. I agree with you. I think there will be a point in time in the future where we will be getting high &quot;digitally&quot;. It&#039;s inevitable. Like you said, I&#039;m sure drugs that don&#039;t even exist yet will be developed/programmed. I&#039;m curious if drugs will then be for sale if they&#039;re digital.. or could they be pirated? Imagine that.. a pirated 8ball of digital coke.. etc<br />Fascinating..

You could make the high stop in seconds, or allow to go on for as along you want.<br /><br />

				And if these digital drugs could be pirated (like the mp3s or movies or other digital goods).. imagine. People never paying for any drugs ever again. I suspected people will sit around high, hookedup to their laptops 24/7. Fuck.
