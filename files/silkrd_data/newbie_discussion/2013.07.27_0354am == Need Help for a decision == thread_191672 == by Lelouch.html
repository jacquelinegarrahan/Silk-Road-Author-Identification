				Hello,<br /><br />So I&#039;m in a bit of a slump I don&#039;t know what to do&nbsp; :&#039;(. I have an order placed on the 15th of this month (3 actually), and the vendor I have ordered from has not messaged me back and it&#039;s still in processing. Should I cancel, ask for refund or just wait it out and I&#039;m being whiny? Would love to get some feedback, thanks.

				If you see that the vendor is logging in everyday, I would message him and tell him that you are going to have to cancel if the order is not sent out within the next 1-2 days.&nbsp; If he doesn&#039;t answer within a day, i&#039;d cancel.&nbsp; If he isn&#039;t logging in or hasn&#039;t in a while, check to make sure that he is not on vacation.&nbsp; It will most likely be posted on his vendor page, in the forums, or his account will be in vacation mode...&nbsp; I don&#039;t think cancelling will affect your stats, so you might as well cancel and order with someone else m8&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah, I wouldn&#039;t have been as patient as you, unless he states on his vendor page that such a long delay may happen.

				I agree with Jigsaw.&nbsp; If the vendor is logging on daily then send them a pm being polite and courteous saying hey I have placed these 3 orders etc and I was wondering if you were going to be shipping them soon as it has been 12 days since I Have placed the order.&nbsp; If you do not get back to me soon I will be forced to cancel the order etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Use your own words and what not though lol

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have three orders with you, ETA for their shipping?

The last 4-5 reviews are 1/5 about him not sending. I received my oz from him, but it shows he never looks at PM&#039;s because I had one 3 days after I ordered and it&#039;s still marked as unread.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to discourage anyone from using the vendor so I think I&#039;ll keep the name hidden, because I think he&#039;s just out of product ATM and too busy with catching up.

				I don&#039;t know man, I&#039;d let people know who it is so they can steer clear. I understand that they are probably busy but that&#039;s a pretty unacceptable level of communication.

				Sounds suspect at best...and rather rude.<br /><br />I aim to answer within minutes (hours at worst!)....and to leave PMs unanswered is poor form. To not action orders, completely unacceptable and unprofessional.<br /><br />As a vendor I suggest you cancel and look for someone who gives a damn about your business and wants to build a positive relationship for the future...<br /><br />Doc

				Sometimes waiting actually helps. I have waited for 4 days before my order got in transit. The vendor pm`ed me saying his laptop broke and said he will add some gifts for the waiting :)

				theDANKBANK&#039;s latest reviews are not making me feel secure haha. <br />&quot;I&#039;ve ordered numereous times from this vendor but this is the first time I never received the wax, thanks for the refund SR&quot; (1/5)<br /><br />&quot; After all the headache of not recieving the package or a response had to take it to resolution. Used to be a decent vendor. Buyer beware!&quot; (1/5)<br /><br />&quot;Had to go through the resolve, it was a shame because I heard many great things about your product. I unfortunately won&#039;t ever go through this vendor as he marked transit, and then a week later told me he just shipped it. Communication was terrible and overall lousy experience. But at least i got 100% refund.&quot; (1/5)<br />&quot;Very disappointed. My order was marked as being shipped on July 9, but I never received it. I wrote two emails but received no response. Will not do business with again.&quot; (5/5)<br />

				I would go ahead and cancel if his latest review has been bad. Does he have an official vendor review page on the forum? You can also message the vendors before ordering to make sure everything is alright (Item stocks, etc) so that way you don&#039;t have to waste your time

I would be livid, and I would have cancelled the moment I was able to. <br /><br />This vendor must have some good shit, that&#039;s all I can say. Considering most vendors ship out within a day or two, why are you even wasting your time? Go with someone else. You could be having fun by now, but instead you&#039;re stressin&#039;. That&#039;s no way for a SR buyer to spend their time. lol
