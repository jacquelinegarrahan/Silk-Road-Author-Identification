				Any of his customers about? Used him a couple times now but with my most recent order I&#039;m getting nowhere. Every day he&#039;s listed as &quot;Last seen: Today&quot; but not processing the order or answering messages.<br /><br />Strange because he&#039;s one of the best vendors on here and his delivery/product have been faultless in the past.<br /><br />Anyone?

				A lot of the bigger vendors use multiple people in different departments to run their business.&nbsp; I use myself and one other.&nbsp; I do all the shipping and my buddy does all the orders.&nbsp; With that in mind it might be a sub account of the person who is on and not the shipper etc

				Ahh never thought about it like that, thanks.<br /><br />Like I say he&#039;s usually perfect and the slight delay made me curious. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s nothing.

				I bought off him as well, feedback looked pretty decent, but disappointed to hear nothing from him after 3 days.

				I had the exact same problem with him.&nbsp; After a while I just cancelled but fair to say I would rather have had the weed.

				After a few days you should be able to cancel the order.&nbsp; Your BTC will go straight back into your wallet :)
