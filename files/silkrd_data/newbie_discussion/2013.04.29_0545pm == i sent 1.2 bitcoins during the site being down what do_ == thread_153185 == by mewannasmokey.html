				Strangely we just posted very similar threads at exactly the same time. <br /><br />See my &quot;How does DDoS affect deposits?&quot; thread. <br /><br />Interested if anyone knows what will be going on with this ...

				I&#039;ve got some money sitting in my account too. Have you set a back up address? I have but haven&#039;t received any money yet. Hopefully DPR sends it soon.

Or somewhere offsite you keep your coins?<br /><br />I have a blockchain wallet I use for most things offsite, but tbh I don&#039;t have lots of BTC sat around doing nothing. I buy the coins I need and usually buy the products quickly on a kind of on-demand basis.

				No need to worry - btc deposits still go through to your btc address even when you can&#039;t access the site.

				&nbsp;8)Thanks Scout for listening to us newcomers... I&#039;m an old fart and still trying to get my head around the whole BTC deal (and some oh so fine smoke I haven&#039;t had in months - and then just an occasional couple of puffs from a buddy with a son running to Colorado every few months...). I got the BTC deposited into my SR wallet (I guess I&#039;m saying this right) and then escrowed to a vendor for goods hopefully shipped (can&#039;t confirm cause I can&#039;t get on SR), leaving only a small amount of change in that SR account. Now can that account be accessed outside of SR? In your experience has there ever been a situation where SR let a new vendor sell and SR keeps all the funds coming in until the $500 escrow is built up? I&#039;ve got some popular stuff that it seems will be no problem turning on the SR, but I have a hard time taking $500 out of my fixed budget (retired) to put up to be a vendor. My vendor income would probably be around $500 a month - I would &quot;barter&quot; that into my drug of choice - weed. I might even get a few hits of LSD-25 some time in the near future...I haven&#039;t tripped in @30 years!&nbsp; Oh the days when we used to get Visine bottle filled with that beautiful clear stuff! Fucking around one night I got a little too big of a squirt straight into my mouth (we used to put drops on a rolling paper so we could manage the dose); a few days later after I crashed out by drinking almost a fifth of Bacardi 151, I woke up to find that I had traded a giant killer Dynaco 500 pre-amp and amp stereo for a bunch of birds! I had a whole chicken operation with enough chickens to supply about 5 dozen eggs a week, eat a couple of chickens a week, and sell a few every month. Also got some ducks, geese, and turkeys for pets outa the deal! Even the chicken wire to and help from my neighbor to build their coup. With the Power, ah-so, Anything is Possible!

				Your coins are there, I did as well but I managed to log in this morning. The site isn&#039;t down, it&#039;s up. In a DDoS the issue is communication between client/server.&nbsp; Your BTC transaction has nothing to do with the server, it&#039;s bitcoin. <br /><br />The coins you sent to your personal SR wallet are sent and well.
