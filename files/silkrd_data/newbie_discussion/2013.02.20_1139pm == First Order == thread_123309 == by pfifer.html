				So, I made my first order on SR, and finalized it today.&nbsp; I would like to know: once I finalize my order, is it normal/standard for it to no longer be listed in my &quot;order&quot; page?&nbsp; That seems strange (and worrisome).

				Maybe... <br />I made my first order today but haven&#039;t finalized it yet, and it is still there. Your best hope is that when you finalize, it goes away. That&#039;s my noobie two cents. Otherwise, wait until someone who knows what they&#039;re talking about comes and tells you.

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The order did &quot;go away&quot; once I finalized it; I just wanted to make sure that is what was *supposed* to happen.

				You can review finalized orders if you go into&nbsp; account and search the submenus :D<br /><br />It is normal, yes.

				There are plenty of vendors on the road who don&#039;t require FE for new buyers- I suggest seeking them out in the future.<br /><br />But yes- good luck with the waiting game!

				My MDPV is between 97-99% pure my lab tested some of theirs and said it was just over 70%.&nbsp; They are also more expensive, and do things like making people FE.&nbsp; If you where buying some MDPV you would be much better off to hit me up.&nbsp; Even if I don&#039;t have any posted for sale you can message me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m never out but sometimes have to stop selling it for a day or two so I can get caught up on shipping orders.
