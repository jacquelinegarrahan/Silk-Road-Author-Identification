				Firstly, most people here dislike fe&#039;ing a great deal. I personally think it&#039;s ok for&nbsp; trusted vendors. Just wanted to get that out there, obviously it&#039;s your decision, but you are creating more opportunity to get scammed when you fe. Research your vendor thoroughly, is what I&#039;d suggest.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;That extended throat clearing over, go to orders section in your account, next to the order you want to fe will be a button that says finalise. Just click it. Note, your order must have been marked as in transit by the vendor before you can finalise. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck! AB

				Yep, everything Aussie Bob said.&nbsp; If your order still says &quot;processing,&quot; you can&#039;t FE.&nbsp; You have to wait until the vendor changes to the order to &quot;in transit.&quot;&nbsp; But really, don&#039;t FE unless you&#039;ve thoroughly researched the vendor AND you&#039;re comfortable with possibly losing your money.

				It sux when they require FE and they are not allowed to until they reach 55 transactions so maybe it&#039;s better to use a new vendor til you get your transactions up

				They require that someone have 55 transactions before they won&#039;t require FR? That&#039;s crazy. I presently only have 21 transactions put i&#039;ve spent near 10k.

Wow, <br /><br />never heard of it being that high, <br /><br />Pro tip: I sell lots of cheap lottery listings that are nearly 50/50 odds so you can buy lots of them and not really lose much money in building up your sales count.<br />Much cheaper than being scammed by a dodgy vendor anyway

				Can&#039;t understand why anyone would FE. You&#039;re also sending the message to the vendor and others that FEing is acceptable. Do yourself and everyone else a favour and take your business elsewhere. <br /><br />

				I have only FE&#039;d twice and one of those was by accident. The other was with a vendor I had already done several transactions with and trusted.
