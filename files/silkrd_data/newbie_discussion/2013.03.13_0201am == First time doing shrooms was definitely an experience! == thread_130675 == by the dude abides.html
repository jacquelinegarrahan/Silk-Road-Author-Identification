				I guess this thread is about my first experience with a (proper) psychedelic/hallucinogenic. It would be cool to hear some stories from you guys too - good or bad! :)<br /><br />So on Saturday night, a friend and I were really up for taking &#039;something&#039;. I&#039;ve placed three orders from SR recently and am in possession of 2c-b, shrooms and LSD. We tried 15mg of 2c-b a week or so ago and had a decent time with it, but we didn&#039;t really trip hard or anything; we just had a good time. We wanted to do something a bit more, and my 3.5g of ground Golden Teachers from Panacea/Foxcave appealed most (shorter trip than acid).<br /><br />We split it in two and drank it down with orange juice. A few minutes later we went out for a joint and all was gravy. After about 20 minutes, though, I was starting to get bending and stretching visuals. I sat quietly for a bit (he wasn&#039;t feeling anything at that point) and I kind of went to a dark place. The room felt too enclosed and I was overwhelmed by the pretty immediate and intense onset of the effects. I&#039;ve done tonnes and tonnes of reading into shrooms, so don&#039;t think I went in unprepared; I definitely wasn&#039;t ready for the full experience though!<br /><br />After a bit, I sort of brought myself out of the bad place and had the most incredible, insightful, powerful and cleansing experience. I found that a lot of the choices I&#039;ve made and ideas I&#039;ve been having in the last year or so were really reaffirmed for me and I could see I was on the right path. It also allowed me to reflect on the best parts of my life - my family, my girlfriend etc. etc. and it taught me a lot about what I consider to be truly valuable in this world. As all this was going on, we were literally in another universe. The room had curved into a spherical planet and the colours, shapes and environment were absolutely indescribable. All conceptions of time were gone, and I was utterly consumed in this new reality. My friend and I felt we really connected on a creative plain during this peak, but we were far too inebriated to craft anything cogent or legible.<br /><br />My friend ended up freaking out a bit and went back to his room, leaving me alone to explore the effects of the mushrooms in silence and contemplation. It was at this point where it sort of overwhelmed me again. I felt like I wasn&#039;t in control of my body (and at one point I could have sworn I pissed myself, but a thorough check upon sobering proved I hadn&#039;t!) and I sort of monged out in my bed. I think I was asleep, but the entire time, I was looking down on myself - proper out of body stuff. I wasn&#039;t sure if I was so consumed in my new reality that I was perceiving the room even though I was actually somewhere else, i.e., a hospital. For a bit of time I was so sure I was tripping balls so much that my friends had found me and taken me to hospital. This was because I could hear voices at certain points (these were just people passing outside my room and window). <br /><br />But I made it out the other side, and had taken a real journey. I put my body through the works and came out sweating and overwhelmed but cleansed. In the few days following, I still felt a bit daunted thinking back to it, because the bad parts (naturally) tend to dominate one&#039;s memories. Since then, however, I have been able to really take a lot of good stuff from the experience and whilst, in the immediacy of coming out of the trip, I was fairly sure I wouldn&#039;t do them again, I&#039;m tempted by the idea of using them at a more appropriate dosage and trying to &#039;master&#039; them. I&#039;ll try the LSD at some point in the next few months and I think this will be a little more manageable, as I&#039;d 1 tab that was advertised at 110ug. <br /><br />So yeah, that was my first shroom trip - a powerful, (at times) overwhelming, draining, yet ultimately enlightening and cleansing experience. Now share yours!!!<br /><br />Peace and good explorations to all :)

				well glad you had an experience that i think in the end was positive.<br />make sure you are in a very comfortable setting when you take the acid. you ate a very small amount of mushrooms and sounds like it was a bit of a rollercoaster for you. the acid will last muccchhh longer and has similar effects. a lot of people find lsd smoother on the mind. mushrooms can be quite dramatic and changing, one minute your laughing your ass off and the next minute your terrified and feeling overwhelmed. <br />some of my favorite trips were when i was growing them. when it would be time to harvest the first flush of the crop me and some good friends would head out to our favorite spot about 45 minutes in the woods. there is a small lake hidden with an amazing view. we would light a fire and just enjoy nature and each others company. my favorite was always eating the mushrooms fresh, as soon as possible after picking them because they are at full potency and the chemicals haven&#039;t started to degrade. i think it gives the best high, plus they taste WAY better compared to dry lol<br />&nbsp;
