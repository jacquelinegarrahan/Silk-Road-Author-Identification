				The way I see it, any person who has anything issued by a government or other capatolistic entity ie: driver&#039;s license, social security number, bank account, credit/debit card, voter&#039;s registration, income tax filings, owns/drives a vehicle...&nbsp; &nbsp;list goes on and on of numbers and other bits of info that get attached to a person&#039;s &quot;paper identiy&quot; that can be used to track and find said person at any time.&nbsp; Therefore, doesn&#039;t that at some point make most people not truly free individuals, but more like &#039;subjects&#039; or &#039;property&#039; of their government?<br /><br />Just doing some random thinking here, but seems like assuming a person can do well enough as a vendor on SR to live a decent life, since everything is transacted in BTC, there would be no real need for such things&nbsp; like bank accounts, credit/debit cards, filing income tax... even having a name, really.&nbsp; &nbsp;One could probably easily enough pay cash for a modest house and not even have their real name go onto any land deed.&nbsp; Of course there would always be those who will drive regardless...&nbsp; &nbsp;that I see as really the only downfall to being otherwise free of any allegiance or obligation to any government.<br /><br />Just a not yet fully thought out concept.....

				At least in the U.s. the monitoring / surveillance of citizens seems to be going rampant. Cash is also still fairly anonymous; but it is not as practicable to exchange in the digital world as something such as BTC. We are never really truly free; I mean total freedom is just anarchy. I&#039;m guessing one main issue of being a vendor, at least a large one, is safely extracting the BTC to cash.

				True, true...&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing I&#039;ve not yet done is to try converting BTC to cash, so....&nbsp; on that I&#039;m really not sure...
