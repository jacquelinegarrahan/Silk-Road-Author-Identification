				I&#039;m down for anything apart from herion, and nothing too expensive, I&#039;m pretty poor and i&#039;m only buying something because it&#039;s my birthday :). Usually just stick to getting high with the stuff i&#039;m prescribed, thank god for free prescriptions.<br /><br />Nothing more than 1 bitcoin, the cheaper the better. Got 20tabs of 25I off my brother, which i&#039;m currently enjoying as a birthday treat. <br /><br /><br />My silkroad username is flettino too, so if you want to try to sell me your product or want to tell me something what you&#039;ve had a good experience with, you can message me on silkroad too! <br /><br />Thank y&#039;all, stay safe.<br /><br />

				If you are into psychedelics and want some interesting and rare stuff, I&#039;d either get mescaline from GammaGoblin (I have communicated with him and he is restocking soon) or AL-LAD from envious or jannis. AL-LAD is the next on my list since I still have some of my last order of GG&#039;s mescaline. It is the real deal! An extremely interesting psychedelic that you might not get a chance to try again in a lab synthesized form. It is one of Alexander Shulgin&#039;s &quot;Magical Half Dozen&quot; phenethylamines. GG also sells DOM, another item on the magical half dozen. I am sitting on several hits of it that I have yet to try myself, but I have heard good things from those with whom I&#039;ve shared it already.<br /><br />AL-LAD is another one of Shulgin&#039;s favorites. It is one of the few LSD isomers that have showed up on SR. It should be very interesting--similar to LSD, but with a shorter duration.<br /><br />gammagoblin: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3923da3fab<br />jannis: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f1fa459c07<br />envious: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/98da200440<br /><br />1 btc will get you some interesting stuff! Enjoy.

				Thanks a lot for your reply my friend, psychedelics have never&nbsp; been my favorite, but i can&#039;t say much because i&#039;ve only took 25i and acid. I&#039;m on 25i right now, enjoying it. <br />Sat outside with my laptop staring at the sky, makes you realize how amazing the world is. <br /><br />I&#039;l take your ideas in consideration, they sounds really interesting. but i just want to see what other people come up with.<br /><br />And once again, thanks a lot for your reply. i really appreciate it

				There is also 25c, which is slightly different. Then all of the 2c&#039;s, DOB, DOM, DMT(!), all kinds of candies with xanax or thc, idk! I&#039;d myself like to try something from DReaMensioN but things there are slightly more expensive. Some good MDMA Nintendos and Lambhorginis floating around if interested. <br /><br />Yeah, well idk. ;)

NO BODY LOAD whatsoever was detected.<br /><br />25i - reminded strongly of 2C-I. lots of sparkle and tracers, energy buzz through the body. feels like an improved 2ci in many ways such as bodyload and the &quot;confusion&quot; being reduced.<br /><br />25C is the best &quot;acid-replacement&quot; of the three in my opinion&quot;<br /><br />clearnet: http://www.ukchemicalresearch.org/showthread.php?tid=566<br />

				It can be so overwhelming because their is so much to choose from! But for me, gonna go with some imported 5-meo-dmt and just keep on hand for that once in a lifetime experience.
