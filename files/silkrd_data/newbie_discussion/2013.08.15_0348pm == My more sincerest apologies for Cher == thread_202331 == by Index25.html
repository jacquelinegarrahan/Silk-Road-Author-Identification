				for the record :<br /><br />the customer thought our stuff was laid with RC&#039;s because of a bitter taste to our blotters. this is NOT a sign of anything people, the bitter taste comes from the substance used to dilute the LSD!!<br /><br />Index25 had these lab tested and as promised, once the results landed and he was proved wrong, he apologised. <br /><br />so all good :)

				I must admit if a blotter had any kind of bitter taste I would be skeptical. LSD is tasteless. While Other psychoactive substances often taste bitter.

				Hi to everyone!<br /><br />@Cher<br /><br />I feel really happy, to solve all the misunderstanding ;D<br /><br />For all forum members, thanks for your words ;)<br /><br />@Vansprinkel<br /><br />Sorry, I do not quite understand your last phrase, my English is very poor, but I&#039;ve learned something, the taste is not conclusive, yesterday the blotters in my mouth are bitter taste and the effects to be only LSD-25, today i feel without bad feelings, comedown, etc... i&#039;m in perfect state phisical and mental, no tired, really fine, and i sleep more of 8 hours; very good LSD-25 is the conclusion!!!<br /><br />I recommended to Cher, is a good seller!!!<br /><br />And... no voy a decir nada más (salvo, gracias Cher! por ser tan comprensiv@) porque hablo inglés de puta pena, jajajjaja<br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Index25

				That&#039;s cool, I&#039;m glad you had a good time. And a good experience with SR. <br /><br />I&#039;m just naturally skeptically. Especially when it comes to eating tiny pieces of paper that basically make me see god. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always heard people talk about &#039;LSA&#039; and &#039;DOM&#039; and now I&#039;m seeing a substance called N-BOME which apparently comes in blotter form.<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess N-BOME is a phenethylamine similar to mescaline. All of these things can be sold as &#039;LSD&#039; and how would you be able to tell the difference? <br /><br />Either way I guess you trip your balls off. But who can be sure what your really taking other than the chemist that made the substance?

				@Vansprinkel<br /><br />Ok, look, is really easy, the N-BOME only take effect sublingual ROA, never ingested, so, blotter (or blotter&#039;s) + water direct to stomach ;)<br /><br />Regards!!!
