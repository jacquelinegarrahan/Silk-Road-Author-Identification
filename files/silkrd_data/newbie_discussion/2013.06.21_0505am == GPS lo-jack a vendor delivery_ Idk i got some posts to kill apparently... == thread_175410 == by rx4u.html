				so im new to this side of the web, and even newer to SR. Ive been doing a lot of reading so far, mostly dos &amp; donts, faqs etc... Im currently downloading tails so i can install it to a usb stick i have to increase my anonymity before i commit to buying any bitcoins, or even making a purchase. which i think is a good idea. anyways i have 45+ posts to kill and after a lot of reading i have a question, stupid or not im not sure. either way i wonder. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So they say its a fact that there are LEO on here, scammers etc...well the thing that concerns me the most obviously is the LEO. I know the tor network is supposed to be super safe and secure with hardcore anonymity. which is great. I guess most LEO have bigger fish to fry than the guy on the deep web who occasionally orders a small amount of bud or pills to his house.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well anyways, if there were LEO posing as vendors ( as im sure there are) and you were to say place an order with them (under the assumption theyre a legitimate and credible vendor) for a large or larger amount of any substance [or if customs or the DEA were to say intercept a package containing a large, felonious amount of narcotics]&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t they place something like a GPS locator device something like a lo-jack system into the package? To track it and confirm reception or whatever. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess my question isn&#039;t whether or not they could use something like this, but how do i order something from a vendor and have it shipped to me and still retain my anonymity if I gave them my &quot;name&quot; and/or &quot;address&quot;?&nbsp; This concept escapes me, everything on here sames safe, discreet and legit. But how is giving out my mailing address &quot;anonymous&quot;....&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve been reading up on how to conduct business, but i know im only scratching the surface here. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So how or what is the proper way to give out your address and remain anonymous? PO box? Ive seen a lot of vendors that say no PO boxes.&nbsp; Send it to the neighbors house, an abandoned house? Those 2 options leave the package open to interception/theft.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure i&#039;ll come across what i need to know soon enough, but until then could someone enlighten me a bit?&nbsp;

				Really?<br /><br />No one? <br /><br />No one has anything to say in regards to my question about receiving product? I think that this would be vital information for anyone on SR to know because it will help keep us all safe, secure and secret. I mean I can totally understand if you disregard my question about the GPS / lo-jack package idea, but basic user/customer safety? Nothing.... <br /><br />Hell just point me in the right direction, a FAQ, a post. Something. <br /><br />Thanks guys. <br /><br />RX4U&nbsp; &nbsp;( coming sooner or later to u! its going to be more later than sooner )

				the only time the anonymity seems to fade is when you are trusting the vendor with your name and your address. But this is the safest bet to make sure that you received the package. Using fake names, abandoned houses, or neighbors address is only asking for trouble and it immediately becomes very suspicious. Keep it simple, use your real name and address and it makes nothing looks suspicious and everything looks legitimate especially if the stealth is done correctly. Make sure you don&#039;t send your name and address to your vendor in plain text. Please read to the security forum and read up about PGP encryption so you can learn to encrypt your messages to your vendor when making purchases. This insures that only the recipient you want to view the message is going to be the one reading it. The security subforum has tons of information and if you spend a little bit of time there I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll learn quite a bit more than you anticipate. Hopefully I could be off at least some of the assistance
