				I read today on another forum that Alexander Shulgin (creator of MDMA, DOC, the 2C series and another 200+ psychedelic compounds) is having some financial difficulties. This man has made an amazing contribution to humanity and especially our community, it&#039;s not too much to ask to spare a few dollars to help out a pioneering psychonaut. I&#039;ve included a link to teafaeries blog (she explains the situation far more eloquently than me) and a link to Shulgin&#039;s research institute where donations can be made. <br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING<br />http://teafaerie.org/2013/02/456/<br />http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/<br />
