				SO.<br /><br />First and foremost, I&#039;m not a newb, I&#039;ve been here for almost a year but I lost my damn password to the forum so here we are.<br />Anyway.<br /><br />User &quot;Ig0wdaflo&quot; is a scamming, cowardly, piece of shit, whom I sent money to for bitcoins, was promised an 8 hour turn around. 24 hours go by, I&#039;m actually concerned for the guy. 48 hours, and a couple more messages later I&#039;m VERY worried, hoping he&#039;s okay, because I&#039;m a nice person. Then he reads all my messages, takes my money, and hasn&#039;t said a word since. I won&#039;t lie, I send him constant messages, first asking for a refund or my coins, then a partial refund, then an explanation only, finally, all I wanted was an apology. Reads all my messages, nothing. My only justification is that he has since gone from perfect (obvious to me now, falsified) ratings to a 68, he&#039;s lost his listings. I&#039;m still out $300, but thankfully, there is a wonderful, wonderful BTC Vendor out there:<br /><br />BitcoinDeal -- Nothing short of amazing, and 5/5 is never enough to give. Perfect in every way, if you need them, that&#039;s your guy. I can&#039;t say enough for what this vendor has put himself through for me, at all hours of the night, seriously. I can&#039;t ever thank you enough.<br /><br />I go to the same vendors for just about everything, a different vendor for each product. I try to stay domestic, with one exception:<br /><br />maligan -- Benzos are something I need to function on a daily, panic disorder, I hope I&#039;m among the non-judgmental here. This man was my first benzo order after my very first order (ONLY other person besides this recent cock sucker to screw me over, no names, because I haven&#039;t seen him) -- quality product, amazing communication, freebies for customer loyalty, and I&#039;ve ordered from him at least a dozen times, probably a lot more, every single time from across the globe: 8 days to the DAY to my mailbox like he hand delivers it himself. Except for one time where it came in SEVEN days. Please order from him, but not too much, because I need him lol.<br /><br />For my domestics:<br /><br />lexq -- I&#039;ve not a lot experience with snow, but it feels amazing, he&#039;s amazing, great communication, great prices, one time he sent me more than I was supposed to get, and he wasn&#039;t even mad. Oh and when he says express, he means it. Amazing.<br /><br />MiMM -- I&#039;ve been hearing very mixed reviews on him (them, actually, I think), and that makes me upset. There may be a little bit of a communication issue, but they always make good, everything is VERY clear in the vendor profile. I don&#039;t get it. 5/5 - and for stealth, the first time I nearly threw it out, that&#039;s how awesome it was.<br /><br />deadmaufive -- LL&#039;s smaller reseller. Amazing product, amazing vendor. It does take some time, but the guy is doing us little people all a huge service by making such an amazing product affordable. Worth the wait. Great communication, amazing product, great stealth, great vendor all around. Don&#039;t second guess him for a second.<br /><br />National Direct -- A recent find of mine. I don&#039;t want to give too much away, kind of secretive, message him. Customer loyalty will make you a very happy person. The only other guy I go to for benzos unless I&#039;m desperate and he&#039;s running low or something. Message him. He will make you glad you did.<br /><br />bbbaacc -- Just going through my first transaction, awaiting arrival, but his prices, communication and shipping times all have a 5/5 thus far. Will update regarding product and stealth, but I have a good feeling about this vendor.<br /><br />There are others here and there, and I took way too long to write this and I have to rush, will update later.<br /><br />Now, fellow newbies (I guess I am one, to the forums anyway) from someone with perfect stats -- before you add your favourites and least favourites, make sure you read the vendor profile. If the guy sounds like a dick and says &#039;if you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy it&#039; -- trust me: DON&#039;T BUY IT.<br /><br />Okay, appreciation time. There are amazing vendors here. Ah, but don&#039;t be afraid to expose the assholes either. <br /><br />Take Care All,<br /><br />--TKB&nbsp; ;)

				MIMM all the way!!&nbsp; 5/5 <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with the haters.<br /><br />Friend, I totally agree. Their profile couldn&#039;t be More clear about expectations, process, delivery... people gotta read. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been dealing with them for almost a year and from my experience MiMM has been a great vendor.&nbsp; For Crystal and G the counts are good, the product is high quality, packaging is great.&nbsp; <br />Sometimes the delivery takes longer than I would hope for but they Did post when they were making changes to their organization and to expect some delays.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to try some other items off their menu at some point. My first order of G was completely Stellar. Fastener your seat belts and enjoy the ride....so fun.&nbsp; :o&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Kribit<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Studdy Buddy -- Well I&#039;m going to have to take you up on that. Looking for some stellar M, I think I&#039;m growing a tolerance to the stuff around here, no fun.<br /><br />Kribit -- Amen my friend. People don&#039;t read. Both times I ordered from MiMM, by the time I got my tracking number, package had already arrived. Worth the wait. Personally I have only sampled the M, interested in the hi-heat snow next.

				Thanks Kablamo! <br /><br />MiMM&#039;s always good (been 4-6 months), I agree, and like many of us vendors, there comes floods of orders, and you gotta write up info that covers everything, make templates for all communications, variable to what the content and nature of the comm is. I remember when MiMM was new getting excited for some domestic shit! <br /><br />For you occassional opiate users, Nuristan is your guy! High quality, affordable, and one of the friendliest, down to earth vendors.<br /><br />For you adderall/dex users, and tweakers who don&#039;t IV or smoke, Arigolo has got the dealsss! Consistency and professional, this brother won&#039;t let you down.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />N. Direct
