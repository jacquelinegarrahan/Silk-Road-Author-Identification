				But don&#039;t take my word for it....here is my feedback over the last 4 hours...(but order soon, this batch is super clean and I&#039;ll be taking a holiday in August)<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried 5 vendors from the UK for this product and I can sincerely say DrCol is the top man imo, best product best stealth you wont be dissapointed ! <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super fast. BEST stealth ever seen so far. Product yet to test but looks great. Will be back!<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived OK, Stealth good, will update when I try<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very fast delivery, excellent packaging and stealth. Haven&#039;t tried product yet, will update in a bit with quality. Thanks Doc!<br />UPDATE: This stuffs the real deal. I&#039;m not big into coke and had only tried the shit found on the streets, now I finally realise why people like this drug. Holy shit! Small lines is all that&#039;s needed with this sort of quality. It was slightly damp as the listing said and a little stuck to the inside of the bag but it looks like the Doc has compensated for this as this looks overweight. I&#039;ll be back!<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this was my first transaction here and Drcol was a total pleasure to deal with.Excellent communication and very helpful.Item was here in less than 24hrs frm ordering(uk to uk)A real gentleman to deal with.Packaging and stealth 10/10,FLAWLESS!! <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excellent on all counts, DrCol is the man <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received within 24 hours, fantastic service, fantastic product! highly recommended <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast(3days europe) good package, quality product &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything good and nice product. Very smooth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First purchase from the doctor. Good arrival time to AUS. looks and smell&#039;s good<br /><br />Would welcome all good-natured clients (including those new to the road) around the world and in return offer you top product, service and an all-round great experience with a helpful attitude especially to those of you just learning the ropes!! :)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Doc
