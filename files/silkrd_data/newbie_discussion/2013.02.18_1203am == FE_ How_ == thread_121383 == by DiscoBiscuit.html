				Soo.. feeling pretty stupid right about now haha. I just put in my first order, requiring FE. <br /><br />Where/how do i FE? I didn&#039;t see it on the order page, or when I finished up my shopping cart. Is it not an option until the vendor does something with the order?<br /><br />I appreciate any helpful replies.<br /><br />DiscoBiscuit

				They have to mark it as &quot;In transit&quot; before you can finalize. I would avoid it if you can, or accept that you may never get the package. There is no way for SR to help you get your money back if the vendor doesn&#039;t send and you finalized.

				You just press &#039;finalize&#039; next to your order. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it though, isn&#039;t very safe for you. Make sure you can trust the seller a lot, and that you&#039;re not buying too much that it would really hurt you financially if you didn&#039;t get it.

				There are quite a few vendors here who don&#039;t require FE from people with new stats- I recommend staying within the escrow!

				Thanks guys I felt like the &quot;processing&quot; and auto-finalize &quot;N/A&quot; were telling me the vendor had to do something before I could FE. Shoulda just gone with the gut instinct I guess haha. and yes i know about FE and not to do it and all...<br /><br />i&#039;ve been a member for nearly two months just watching and observing basically. the seller who required FE is very reputable, and the prices couldn&#039;t be matched by many. To get my girl Molly to the States, FE is pretty much required by all vendors unless I have more orders or go domestic (screw US MDMA prices)
