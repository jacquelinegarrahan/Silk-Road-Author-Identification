				Me too.<br /><br />I love my first purchase of each day.<br /><br />If you and the vendor never discussed anything on FE and his isn&#039;t one of the profile pages that says &quot;all Newbies must FE until x transactions&quot; then fer sure you don&#039;t wanna go anywhere NEAR the FE button until you have it in your hand.<br /><br />Sometimes 75% of the forum is people FEing and getting screwed over at times and older members laughing and saying &quot;told you to never FE&quot;

				IF you really really really trust the vendor you may FE, however you assume all the risk. It&#039;s generally not a good idea. But for vendors I have ordered from successfully often I will FE to get them their BTC as soon as possible. Yes that presents extra risk to me but I am willing to take it for good vendors. Let&#039;s face it, without good vendors, SR would be for naught.

				CONGRATS! I ordered my first package yesterday.<br /><br />Never Finalize Early and if they require it - find a seller who doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Then ONLY finalize when you receive your order!

Mine didn&#039;t arrive today - I expect it either tomorrow or Saturday. If not it&#039;ll probably be Monday. It is possible to find Vendors who don&#039;t require you to FE - it helps to have an account that has been on SR for a month or two before ordering. Also you might have to pay a little more and get less but its better than FE&#039;ing and losing your money... so umm yah.
