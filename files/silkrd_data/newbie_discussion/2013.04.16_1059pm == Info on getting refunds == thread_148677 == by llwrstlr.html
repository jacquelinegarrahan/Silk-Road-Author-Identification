				I understand the escrow system and the resolution process?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for anyone who has been through it and if they have been successful in getting their btc&#039;s back (at original value).&nbsp; I have a vendor who hedged my funds (fortunately) and it&#039;s been over a week and he stopped communicating.&nbsp; I&#039;m asking for my btc&#039;s back because I have a bad feeling now about the legitimacy of the product, and I doubt it&#039;s been shipped because I&#039;ve never had priority shipping arrive after 3-4 days.&nbsp; I have a few more days until I bring it to resolution?&nbsp; Is that the way to go to get my $ back and at the same time will it hurt my stats?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand why I couldn&#039;t get a simple reply from a vendor that has a lot of transactions and seems totally legit.&nbsp; Any suggestions please?

				I have used the resolution center and gotten a 100% refund. In my case several people had left negative feedback and the vendor had not been on in a few days.<br /><br />Yes refund rate shows up in your stats. I got a 100% a few times and last time I only got 50%. I think I am startling to look bad when I legitimately just tried a few bad vendors. <br /><br /><br />Allot of vendors get so many messages they don&#039;t reply to some.&nbsp; But that combined with no shipping could be a scam.

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I understand they may get so many msgs and not reply right away, but this one replied when I was about to order and then after I ordered and said it hasn&#039;t arrived after 4 days I left a couple other messages and haven&#039;t heard anything.&nbsp; Probably because I told him let&#039;s just skip the resolution process and please just send my btc&#039;s back.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see if it arrives, if not I have a few more days then I&#039;ll hit the resolution process.&nbsp; If I never got the product and he can&#039;t provide a tracking # then I would think I would get a full refund...I hope

				birdie - if he didn&#039;t have 300 transactions I would think so, but I have a feeling you may be right in this case.&nbsp; At least it&#039;s in escrow and was hedged so I should be able to get my $ back...hopefully
