				I&#039;m here to review the sample I received from pkizenko98.&nbsp; I received about a gram each of the Hawiaan and the Sky walker.<br />1st the Skywalker:&nbsp; This pot is dense and trichome rich, and is also quite potent!&nbsp; The high was also very stoney and heavy for me.&nbsp; The gram came in 2 dense nuggets with heavy trichomes and yellowish hairs.&nbsp; Manicure was perfect.&nbsp; Fragrance was closer to the coffee, resiny type of smell and quite pleasant.&nbsp; High was great if you need relaxation and lasted for hours!&nbsp; <br /><br />Next, the Hawaian,&nbsp; First, the fragrance is just WOW!&nbsp; it has a very organic, sweet, flowery and aromatic smell.&nbsp; The buds were a bit less dense and trichome rich than the skywalker, but still impressive.&nbsp; Seemed to show more sativa heavy genes with a higher, headier effect.&nbsp; My favorite part was still the smell though!<br /><br />The packaging was more than perfect for a domestic shipment.&nbsp; both samples were triple sealed in high quality vapor, mylar packets!&nbsp; Outside of package was pro and blended with regular mail.&nbsp; Shipping took a bit more than expected, but no big deal.&nbsp; pkizenko98 was friendly and communicated the whole way.&nbsp; Great guy!&nbsp; I recommend giving either of these varieties a try as long as the price is right for you; everything else will def be right!&nbsp; thanks for the sample!<br /><br />recommend A++<br /><br />-nwpg

				so I hate to have to leave this sort of review for this vendor because I give the benefit of the doubt to all vendors that communicate often and quickly, makes them seem like there on the ball. <br /><br />so I ordered a 1g sample of Hawaiian, but was told before I bought that if I ordered his sample that he would give me 1g of sky walker and one of Hawaiian.... so who wouldn&#039;t jump on that. so I arrive at his vendor page and see he is charging close to 15 dollars for a *free sample * then I had to pay an extra 16 for shipping... at this point I feel a little dumb but go on with the order anyway... again dumb off me but I did a lot of research on the vendor and checked feedback and reviews that were from older members of the site... so I thought let&#039;s try. so I buy it and then he tells me I will only receive the skywalker first and then the Hawaiian after, so I think to myself why wouldn&#039;t he just give 2gs of what he had, instead of sending one through Sr transaction and one through the mail after?&nbsp; I received the first time and only gram abt five days later, when I paid for priority, then he says he sent the second one and it says deliverd so he gives me a tracking code that says it was sent to the WRONG address 3 days ago, I let him know it was wrong and that he could keep the Lil btcs he got but I&#039;m going to let my review and feedback reflect so here goes<br /><br />shipping 3/5- arrived five days after It was marked in transit and I paid for priority which costed me 17 dollars... U could have just listed it as first class if it wouldn&#039;t be here in 4 days at the max... and a gram short<br /><br />stealth4/5- stealth was pretty good but Def could have been flagged as it had only one visual barrier that was almost like it was already opened, but the gram was tripped sealed in mylar bags so that was why I was generous with the 4<br /><br />product-5/5 I can&#039;t deny the skywalker was Damn good... But it was still a g light and the other g you so called sent to me is in state no where near me. <br />so overall I give this guy a 3/5 I mean I&#039;d rate it 5/5 if it were actually a free or cheap sample just out of respect. <br />but having to pay close to thirty dollars for one gram and a mis-ship is just not good. <br />and btw I didn&#039;t use a dumb name or address used a secure location as needed so the address I gave him was good... I mean I got the first, why the mis ship on the second? fishy shit man

				yea I did ask that for future reference wanted to know if my package would be sent with a fuckin invoice on it saying I paid thirty dollars for it and then as soon as I open it see a [PACKAGING DETAILS REMOVED]... not suspicious at all and then you openly said you would send the other g in the mail after I got the first one to make sure I got it... I&#039;ll put you on blast and then we can see what the people of the forum think... Also why would I be Le buying sample gs I&#039;m just another roadie who would rather try a sample before I go big like many others, of course i wanna know if your going to send a dumb ass package again outside of Sr and get me busted, and you even gave me the tracking number and saw it was sent to the WRONG address....

				Not even gonna waste my time. if your not LE, your just plain stupid.&nbsp; I have the tracking with your address as confirmed.&nbsp; On top of that the first package got to you, and u were on my nuts about the shipping and if thats how they all come.&nbsp; Now all of a sudden u wanna claim you didn&#039;t get the second.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand the idiots who try to scam vendorss, if I was not a gentleman I would have your address saved knuckle head.&nbsp; Just word to the wise if you think its smart to continue to be an asshole and fuck around, the next vendor may not be so nice!&nbsp; Enjoy your bud my man.

				yea cause I just checked it to confirm but you see there it says package was signed for I never signed for anything nor was I aware I had to... nor did I sign for the first one... so I say again I never received it and I absolutely never sign for anything... so now that your tracking number you gave me after u gave me the fake one to expose me both said they were signed for I see there is still a question... who received the package that I obviously didnt

				If a sig was required, that means the morons at the post office fucked up.&nbsp; I as well as anyone on here knows that you never sign for shit!&nbsp; Shit happens however, those are human beings who run the postal service!&nbsp; However regardless of their mishap, the package was delivered to its destination.&nbsp; The destination you provided, simple as that!

				every one can look up both the tracking numbers and see a sign was required and acquired. so I&#039;m not lying nor am I stupid or sound stupid ha I&#039;m capable of reading a simple track and confirm description lol and even if only my address asked for a sig why did it? The first one you sent did NOT and the second you sent outside of Sr did.... smells of a setup actually glad it never arrived . like I said lesson learned, make sure who ever you trust you info with doesn&#039;t have their head stuck so far up their ass.

				lol anything to keep your already dead ass thread goin, its sad a good paying customer comes and gives your biz a chance and you repay it with shitty customer service and&nbsp; confrontation . what makes you think anyone wants to deal with an asshole vendor such as yourself ? i mean you even threw a jab at me cause you THOUGHT i was a country boy and tell me you have traveled through my state and act like you know the people here ? lol id say good luck to you and your future biz on the road...but i dont see you getting any in the near future haha so to you i say learn to have respect for your customers if you ever want to conduct good biz.

				just cause you or someone else order from him and it works out doesn&#039;t mean anything... think of the highly reputable vendors that go rouge after being at the top and start selective scamming but it&#039;s whatever Idc abt it cause he only got me for 30 dollars so that ain&#039;t worth dealing with a vendor and his trolls that he gets to come in here and vouch for him and you deserve msgs from the people that are interested in doing biz with you I&#039;m sure they don&#039;t want something like this to happen and then you shun them and put up dumb threads talking abt someone tried to scam you knowing that your in the wrong but not being a stand up guy and admitting it and as for the comment on your shitty packing I want people in your thread to see it so they don&#039;t take the risk of getting their address flagged.... meaning it&#039;s time to rethink your stealth my man.

				So, new member, recently put in an order for a sample of Hawaiian.<br />It&#039;s only my third purchase here, to be honest, but the vendor replied quickly and I&#039;m satisfied with the service as of now.<br />(That hiccup in the middle of this thread worried me, but I&#039;ve also had no problems ordering, so no biggie)<br />Will update when I receive it.

				what constitutes a high price (in USD)?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of $100 QP&#039;s (that was grower price), and I&#039;ve seen $100 for 5 grams (and that guy doesn&#039;t get my money anymore).&nbsp; Supply and demand, cost of cultivation (time spent, equipment bought, electrical bill, rent/mortgage/land ownership) and where the dude is at on the distribution chain.&nbsp; The reason I haven&#039;t smoked weed for a month (maybe longer) is cause I was not ok with paying the prices I was paying, like $50 an 8th, or $100 for 5 grams, and none of it was anything to write home about.&nbsp; And I&#039;m a lightweight when it comes to drugs.<br /><br />I also find it so ironic when I meet a weed dealer IRL who is super opposed to ecstasy sales or use, but selling weed is all cool.&nbsp; Thing is, when people who smoke weed are rolling, they smoke WAY more weed than usual, hence, selling E, helps you sell more weed.&nbsp; That&#039;s just been my observation.

				Hello good poeple of The Road<br /><br />It has recently come to our attention that others in our growing community have been taking credit for our signature strain of cannabis.&nbsp; We have taken the necessary measures to correct this, one measure being that we have changed the name from Hawaiian to Hawaiian Wow.&nbsp; We hope by distinguishing our bud further it will add to its popularity.<br />So lets clarify.&nbsp; Hawaiian Wow is &quot;OUR&quot; signature strain, it &quot;CANNOT&quot; be acquired anywhere other than from us.&nbsp; Any other claims to the contrary are simply flat out lies.&nbsp; Hawaiian Wow reviews can be found on our review thread as well as upcoming competitions for 420.<br /><br />pkizenko98
