				I placed and order and paid the bitcoins that goes along with it. Status has been &quot;processing&quot; since thursday last week. <br />As I am new to this, I worry. <br />What happens if i press &quot;cancel&quot;? I get my bitcoins back, being able to place a new order for them, or what?

				That is a long time to wait.&nbsp; My first 3 transactions were held up 72 hours in &quot;processing&quot; mode.&nbsp; In my opinion, that is too long to wait when it&#039;s a US domestic shipment.&nbsp; I know SR isn&#039;t Amazon.com but there should be a minimum standard of 48 hours AT THE MOST that a vendor has before the order must be&nbsp; &quot;in transit.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Just In Time&quot; processing is what is expected and what people are accustomed to these days.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would cancel the order.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp;

				Cancel the order. I placed a order with a vendor that I&#039;ve used before and he never shipped or replied to my message. After seeing some negative reviews come in before I could cancel, I canceled right away. Best of luck!

				if you go on the vendors profile you can see when they were last online. but yeah you can cancel and you&#039;ll get your money back, less any commission and hedging fees that may apply.

				Something similar is happening with Dusk Dawk Pharmaco. Ordered from him, said processing for a few days, then in transit for 2 days, then he cancelled, and now he is in stealth mode with all of his items down.<br />I still have another order with him I can&#039;t cancel, but it seems something sketchy is going on with him.

				A lot of the SR sellers are busy as all shit. So, its not all that uncommon to wait a few days before shipment. Though more than 4 days is for me, and for many other as well, far too long. <br /><br />Since the order was not processed, you did not actually pay for the item yet. Your coin will be refunded to your account upon cancellation.

				What does it mean when a vendor goes into &quot;stealth mode&quot; ??&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So basically it just changes the vendor&#039;s profile page so we can&#039;t read anything?&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m confused by the whole concept and don&#039;t understand its purpose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please excuse my dumb question.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for any input anybody feels like submitting.&nbsp; Appreciate it..... :D

				Stealth mode means the listings are hidden but still avaible on sr. To see them you have to have the listing bookmarked (or be a fan of the vendor? this may or may not show it idr)

				Bookmarked items should appear on the right, when you first load up SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like on the &quot;home&quot; SR page, for lack of a better term.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tab that reads &quot;Welcome! Silk Road&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope that makes sense.&nbsp; &nbsp;
