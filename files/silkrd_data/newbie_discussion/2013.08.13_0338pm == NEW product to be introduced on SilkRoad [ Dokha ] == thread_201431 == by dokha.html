				Hi silkroaders i was thinking of providing a new product on The Silk Road online market.<br />Im sure a lot of you heard of a tobacco called &quot;Dokha&quot; smoked through a pipe called &quot;Medwakh&quot; if you haven&#039;t then here is a little description about it <br /><br />Dokha has been around the middle eastern region for many decades, the “Dokha” is pure and original Arabic tobacco that is smoked through a pipe called “Medwakh”. The tobacco used in Dokha is very popular in the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and other Middle Eastern Countries. In the past, the local people of the region smoked “Dokha” because it gave them a stimulating and comforting head rush. They originally used hollowed animal bones as pipes; however craftsmen also made pipes using different types of exotic woods, as a sign of prestige and status. The art of cultivating “Dokha” tobacco has come a long way. The quality of the blend is decided by choosing crops that are irrigated by fresh water only and crops that are grown organically. The tobacco used in Dokha is a tender crop, which explains the green color of the tobacco.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dokha is a 100% pure, additive free tobacco. It is an extremely invigorating form of pure tobacco available in various grades. Dokha is an Arabic term which means “Dizzy” in English. Dokha is known for the very direct head rush of Nicotine which leaves one with a light headed feeling, despite being small. It is known as one hitter. <br />It is smoked in small pipes called Medwakhs and the bowl size is 25 mg approximately.<br /><br />Significant Features To Other Tobaccos :<br />• Tobacco consumption is substantially lower when compared to available alternatives.<br />• Quick, inconspicuous, stimulating and comforting head rush.<br />• Odors quickly dissipate and do not stick to your clothes.<br />• 100 % Tobacco 0% Nonsense.<br />&nbsp;<br />You should try it when on something&#039;s ( if you know what i mean ) then you really get a buzz especially on alcohol or other substances :) <br /><br />well now to the important part, i know theirs a lot of people selling dokha in the states already (which was initially my plan before when i had a family member there i was sending it over to him and it was selling out pretty quick as soon as we established and were about to put it into action he came back home. So I&#039;m guessing a lot of people got the idea ) but I&#039;ve tried most dokha from the vendors online and none of their product is good it is nonsense dokha compared to what me and a group of people smoke &quot;Kings Dokha&quot; this dokha is not mixed it is pure plant ( 1 plant not a lot of plants crushed and mixed together ) vendors usually do that to increase the buzz. The dokha i get is from one plant only and it just finished drying and is ready to smoke.(grows at one time of the year)<br /><br />Dokha is categorized in 3 categories : <br /><br />Cold<br />Warm<br />Hot<br /><br />the &quot;Kings Dokha&quot; comes in a warm blend which is what most people smoke <br />i will be providing the Kings Dokha for the warm category this will be the premium i get this straight from the farm its cultivated for a certain few and myself :) .<br />A special for the cold also ( which is also very top quality dokha , better than anything else you can buy on the market guaranteed ).<br />I will not be providing HOT dokha straight away since its too harsh for most amateurs and is very harsh on the throat but if you really want it then hit me up and well figure something out :) .<br /><br />And now for the midwakh (the pipe you use to smoke the tobacco)<br />i will be providing only top quality wood in various designs with no metal head most same color ( blackish/dark brown) check picture out, i find these the top quality and longest lasting pipe they are high quality and look nice too. I will provide 2 different pipes in the beginning and low cost one and the one i just described above <br />Low cost-for the people who are new to dokha <br />High cost-to all the smokers who know what the buzz is all about ;) <br /><br />Filters, this is what goes at the end of the pipe to filter the tobacco i prefer to use one brand which i find the best ( taste wise and filtration wise ).<br /><br />Pipe cleaners ill be providing in a bundle of 25 <br /><br />And a bag (chanta) which i will include free of charge if dokha or pipe is purchased.<br /><br />I will also be taking any wholesale inquiries. Theirs a huge market for this product in the EU (UK especially) and USA you can make a lot of money selling this in those countries, hit me up for any wholesale inquiries well come to a good deal :) .<br /><br />Shipping , i can provide any type of shipping you want either first class mail ( registered or not ) ,&nbsp; and express mail if requested , even though i recommend the first class mail.<br />All packages will be packed stealthy even though theirs no need for it. I still wish to do so as this is a anonymous market :) .<br /><br />Everything will be done through the escrow system so no need to FE , all customer information will be destroyed after order is placed , <br />you can either use the silk road to post your address or through the pgp encryption , i will post my key if i decide to launch the vendors account.<br /><br />i wanted to purpose this idea and wondered what you silkroaders think of this product, willing to see the demand and if theirs enough i will defiantly open a vendors page and start selling my product on a small scale if demand rises i will include different pipes and maybe different blends of dokha.<br /><br />Let me know what you guys think :)<br /><br />NOTE : that this product is 100% legal <br /><br />( I&#039;ve been reading through the forums and deep web about bit coins and how to stay secure and safe on the net.<br />IF i decide to vend i will be using one laptop for BUSINESS only that will be securely encrypted , connected to the internet / through a vpn service then through the tor browser.That should be good enough from the research i have done if theirs any other suggestions please let me know , all sensitive information will be exchanged through the use of pgp encryption. ADDRESSES will never be saved as soon as its printed that&#039;s it , its gone.)&nbsp;

				It sounds a bit like that tobacco you can buy in Istanbul from those massively loaded carts!<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a market for it somewhere, especially since it&#039;s legal and not easily obtainable. Hell, you could probably sell it to legit middle eastern stores through SR. Could you imagine? Using SR as a legitimate purchasing system? That would be pretty interesting....

				Just a piece of advice:&nbsp; Don&#039;t offer samples unless you have a vendor account.&nbsp; There have been too many issues in the past where people have had serious issues when going that route.<br /><br />We are interested in this tobacco you speak of though.&nbsp; I would like more information in regards to your product.

				These were actually available at a at time. They are legal here, bunch of shops carry it. I had people mistake it for pot on several occasions, security guard even tried to take it from me so I had to make a scene. After smelling it though he realized.

				while this definitely sounds interesting, no it is not legal everywhere, mainly because nicotine content is limited for each country (USA allows slightly more than EU for example) while dokha contains 5-6 times of that what you would typically find in regular cigarettes. <br /><br />
