				i love errl.&nbsp; it is all i smoke, and all i really care to smoke (except for maybe a lil dippy now n then but thats a whole other story).&nbsp; so the first purchases i made on SR were all BHO, since i can only get shitty stuff around town these days and dont always have the time to blast my own.&nbsp; if you don&#039;t own a rig, pls dont even attempt to get into this shit until you&#039;ve got a decent little concentrate piece (i&#039;ve got a kettle curve myself and HIGHLY recommend these over nails/standard curves), because you&#039;re just wasting your money.&nbsp; but anyways here&#039;s what i&#039;ve got to report:<br /><br />thegreenovendoor sent me about 1.3 of what they called &quot;pure kush oil&quot;.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t know if they meant that it was actually derived from the strain pure kush itself or if it was just some shit they tacked on, but it was definitely a nice high, good dark gooey consistency to work with and lots of flavor.&nbsp; gives you a great body buzz, but this had obv been underpurged, and i got a little bit of fireworks going if i took too big a dunk.&nbsp; not super potent really id say about average.<br /><br />novartis hooked me up with 1.5 of LA Confidential oil, which came in a syringe (i thought this was actually kind of annoying to work with, other people seem to like it).&nbsp; this shit was just gloop, probably some of the runniest BHO ive ever seen.&nbsp; tar black.&nbsp; they were really hyping this one up as being a &quot;high CBD&quot; extract, which intrigued me, but i wasn&#039;t expecting a whole lot and figured it was mostly just sales talk.&nbsp; let me be real here for a minute: i take a LOT of medications for a chronic condition that all have very, very powerful side effects, mainly nausea, exhaustion, confusion, complete loss of appetite, intenstinal discomfort and generalized pain/soreness.&nbsp; it was 5 pm and i had yet to be able to force myself to eat that day, due to extreme nausea/acid reflux type shit.&nbsp; after a couple globs of this oil, i stood up and realized all of a sudden that i didn&#039;t feel FUCKING TERRIBLE.&nbsp; this was amazing and i&#039;ve never had an oil that felt so medicinally rich and calming.&nbsp; my guts calmed down and i made my way to the kitchen and actually found something that looked edible to me!&nbsp; this really was great, i am fully convinced after trying it that there are truly some amazing properties in CBD.&nbsp; however, this oil EXPLODED off the skillet multiple times when i was dabbing, and literally CAUGHT FIRE like three times when it was on the pad.&nbsp; it left a thin black film that just kind of peeled off, really weird, to me these are definite signs of some poorly made oil.&nbsp; i loved the CBD aspect but wow, i&#039;ve never had a puddle go up in flames like that..&nbsp; <br /><br />next i got a couple from cannabisarbiter.&nbsp; his amber shatter bho was huge rocks and burned clean, average potency.&nbsp; very nice looking though.&nbsp; after that i dipped into the purple candy moonshine extract (basically just an iso wash with banana moonshine).&nbsp; this was good shit, tasted amazing, but was much lower in potency than i&#039;d hoped.&nbsp; i ended up burning through it pretty quickly.&nbsp; this guy seems kind of sketchy, search around the main forums about him a little bit, and keep yourself informed if u decide to cop from him.<br /><br />scoobydoosmokes67 came thru big time on my next order, which was an SFV OG Kush wax.&nbsp; this stuff is MY SHIT.&nbsp; in terms of potency, it whooped all the competitions ass, and it also was the most fully purged w/o losing too many of those beautiful terps..&nbsp; i dunked like .2 my first go, and ended up almost falling off the toilet because it hit me so hard (also i coughed my ass off, this stuff seriously expands!).&nbsp; i would have to say right now out of the few that i&#039;ve tried, scoobs&#039; truly takes the cake.&nbsp; <br /><br />as of now i&#039;ve got a big order of wax &amp; bho coming in from the main man nuggz, which should be here sometime today.&nbsp; ill be sure to let yall know how it is, but i have a feeling im in for a real treat (people have been RAVING about the dudes sour tsunami, which i also invested in for the purpose of total blastation).&nbsp; <br /><br />anyways, i know BHO is kind of a niche thing, but its truly expanding and i see that reflected in the silk road community, so i wanted to toss in any little knowledge i have about it all to hopefully make it a more rewarding experience for everyone involved.&nbsp; i see people like just4u2nv and twolips carrying what looks like to be some beautiful concentrates, as well as fast forward, whose blue dream wax is supposedly out of this world, and its giving me a lot of hope in the future of concentrates on SR..&nbsp; just realize, it&#039;s all about supply and demand, and if we as a community aren&#039;t demanding a truly affordable and superior product, then all we&#039;ll get is whatever ppl are willing to throw at us..&nbsp; anyways peace out, put some reviews in here yourself if you feel like it, or just ask questions; i know this is still a relatively new thing in some parts of the US/world so get yourself acquainted and trust me, once u take that first dab there&#039;s no going back.&nbsp;

				kettle curves are nice but they have stainless steel wires wrapping the pad so they are not good IMHO. Until mothership uses titanium wire to wrap their kettle and other curves the honeybucket is the way to go.
