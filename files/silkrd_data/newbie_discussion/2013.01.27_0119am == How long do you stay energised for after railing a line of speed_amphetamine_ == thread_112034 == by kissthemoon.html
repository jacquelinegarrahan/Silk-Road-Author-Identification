				Today i tried speed for the first time. Bought from sr vendor capecrusader. <br />Didn&#039;t have a scale so started off with very small lines to get a feeling for a good dose. Didnt take long before I got a nice buzz going. Experienced some euphoria en nice energie. Overall very pleasant, liked it very much. Also my ability to focus was enhanced greatly.<br />&nbsp;<br />But after taking a line the euphoria disapeared in about an hour, and the feeling of extra energie disapeared in about 1,5-2 hours. Not to say i experiences no effects at all at this point, still felt pretty awake, eyes pretty wide open and some not unpleasant jaw tension, heart bpm arounf 100. Also couldnt help but move my feet/legs all the time in rytme of the music that was playing. But just didnt felt so energised anymore, and longed for another dose (I now understand the binge potential from speed).<br /><br />Redosed a couple times after these initial effects of energie wore off. When redosing every 1,5 - 2 hours I imagine this speed-high could go on for a long time. Since it was just an experiment to get a feel for the drug, I stopped redosing after 7 hours from the start.<br /><br />I always thought speed was supposed to give the pleasant effects for a longer period than just 2 hours? Does this has to do with the route of administration? Will orally taken doses keep one energised for a longer period? And does the size of the dose has impact on the length?<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in how long a dose lasts for for you guys, how often do you redose and what route of administration is used?<br /><br />One other thing, I noticed that I experienced cold hands and feet, and overall a bit of a cold sensation, turned up the heat but this didn&#039;t help much. I understand that his has to do with bloodvessels getting tighter while on amphetamine, and a rise in bloodpreasure. Can this be prevented, by for example taking a betablocker?<br /><br />Thanks for reading and looking forward to your replys :)

				Btw 8 hours after the last dose and no sign of getting tired yet. Also still a bit stiff yaw and big eyes. So the amph is still acting i suppose. Took a .5mg xanax and 5mg valium and a glass of wine, signing off for tonight!<br /><br />Have a nice one.

				Well first of all I&#039;m a little dubious of what quite constitutes as &quot;speed&quot; around here.&nbsp; The word&nbsp; &#039;speed&#039;&nbsp; to me is a very loose, generic term for any upper. (other than coke)&nbsp; I know others have more precise definitions.&nbsp; So the exact ingredients in your &quot;speed&quot; will tell us a lot about what to expect.&nbsp; &nbsp;But since we don&#039;t know the actual components, we will have to talk in general terms.&nbsp; &nbsp;Generally speaking, what you described sounds very typical; you had a generally average response to the &quot;speed&quot; in my opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;The feelings of re-dosing will be evident and hard to ignore.&nbsp; For instance, if I had a bag of speed I would likely finish it off over the course of 12-14 hours, knowing I wouldn&#039;t be sleeping that night.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s fine, I go into it with that mentality.&nbsp; Coming down with benzos and alcohol is also very standard (although I hate to encourage anybody to mix benzos and booze, just a rough combination in excess.)&nbsp; &nbsp; You also experienced vasoconstriction as you so acutely observed, an extremely common side effect.&nbsp; To remedy this I usually take an aspirin which works as a blood thinner, mainly as a preventative measure.&nbsp; Lots of water intake should help too.&nbsp; I would strongly discourage the taking of beta-blockers, as studies have shown they do not play nice with stimulant compounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, alpha-blockers would be fine, and I would keep some around for an emergency.&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all, it sounds like you had a very typical speed experience, and handled yourself nicely......cheers, man.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; &nbsp; (My opinion is based on my own years of usage and that of my friends....others on the thread may have completely different viewpoints on this.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
