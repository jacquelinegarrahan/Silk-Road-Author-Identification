				When you guys start up Tor if you look at some point it says creating SSID or IP address or something. So basically Tor creates a fake IP address instead of using the actual one your home internet uses. It makes one that isn&#039;t real but no matter what anyone does they can&#039;t figure out what the actual IP address is cause the fake one is all it will send. I still share all of your paranoia cause it is pretty nerve racking dealing with drugs on a completely MASSIVE drug center hidden from the government. haha. But with all the precautions I found out they take for this site it really does seem safe. The person who referred me to use this site was telling me how he found out that after your order they erase ALL the info you gave them for them to send you your order so it can&#039;t be traced to anyone. Technically you can&#039;t get in trouble for being on a website even if it has illegal things as long as there&#039;s no attempt or actual purchase and since everything is erased, if somehow they figure out what your package is and they come to your house, really the only thing you can do is put on your best confusion face and say you have no idea why or how that is getting sent to you. I wish everyone on here the best of luck and times! It is terrifying to even be on here but it&#039;s a great opportunity and it seems pretty safe. My friend made a huge order and we enjoyed that order all week long with no problems. I hope the best for everyone else too.

				Write to your local police station informing them that as a user of illegal substances, you&#039;d like to opt your property out of police protection for the duration you&#039;re living there.<br /><br />Seriously though, unless a package is intercepted you&#039;re pretty much safe. Just don&#039;t order more than personal use to your home address, you&#039;ve got less chance of being busted for mail drugs than you have going out and mixing with dealers.

				Also I just realized the fact that this site uses their own currency so there is technically no money trail. So in all technicality you can&#039;t get busted for buying anything off of here because in all technicality, you didn&#039;t actually pay for the drugs because it wasn&#039;t done with real money. I don&#039;t think that defense would hold up to well in court if you did get busted, but if you do, it&#039;s really worth a try to use that excuse if you don&#039;t feel like denying it. Sure these points are like putting money on a gift card in a sense, but since this site isn&#039;t legal, the &quot;gift card&quot; can&#039;t legally be recognized as a form of real currency meaning you technically didn&#039;t actually buy it. So in all legality, you donated money to someone you don&#039;t know and someone you don&#039;t know just decided to send you a package of drugs. But we all know how the law goes so good luck with getting that reason to work. Better than nothing though in my opinion.

				I don&#039;t think police can invite you due to using TOR. You can hide that you use TOR by using VPN and first you connect with VPN then with TOR.<br />However, I don&#039;t think your ISP will report on police that you use TOR because it&#039;s not prohibited.

				Just take a few minutes to read on Wikipedia how tor and .onion sites work , use all the precautions listed on here and use some common sense. I cannot stress the last past enough. If it quacks like a duck and it looks like a duck , then hey , its a duck. And think about it like this: if we all have a common denominator when it comes to being secure on here , it acts as a second layer of insulation from LEO. If some one fucks up , chances are they give up the site and shit rolls down hill.

				Everyone should read the Tor Blog. I just found it last night, and it&#039;s something that should be read on the regular. Through that blog I leaned that the person on the Exit node (end) of the relay chain chain intercept data. But it seems like there are ways to increase your security, besides putting as little info about yourself on this forum! Us small fish shouldn&#039;t be too concerned, but should remain informed for our own safety.
