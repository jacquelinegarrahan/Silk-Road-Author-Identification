				Hey all, just wanted to let you know that I put myself back together completely. I have become who I came here to be, and I did it without finishing my vial, or eating any of the LSD from Lucydrop or Tesselated, so now I still have all that to help others. I don&#039;t have any visuals except seeing trees living and stretching into possibility, and the music in my head is clear but not intense, but my thoughts are completely in my power, full access to my imagination and ability to relate things, same as peaking on LSD. Last time I &quot;came down&quot; only the hallucinations, the illusions, left. Just like my illusions of being limited within my self.<br /><br />If any of you experience any negative feeling ever, ask yourself why and you&#039;ll see how your subconscious creates the situations you react to. When you get in touch with it, become one with it, you will become whole.

I no longer have any inkling of depression whatsoever.<br />2. I no longer have writer&#039;s block.<br />3. I&#039;m finally with the girl I want to be with, and I can finally relate to her instead of being trapped within myself when she&#039;s next to me.<br /><br />Of course I&#039;m getting further out there, reality is a pretty far out thing. If everything I&#039;m thinking weren&#039;t true for me, I&#039;d be dead, or broke, or homeless. Instead I&#039;m fully alive, I&#039;ve got a couple thousand to tide me over until my creativity brings in the cash, and I have a roof over my head.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be honest - I did lose my grip in the middle of a few trips. But I got it back. There&#039;s nothing wrong with talking with the voices in your head when you know they&#039;re all just aspects of you. We are ideas coming into being, SS - your ego is there to protect your higher self from judgment and limitation until it can define itself clearly enough to stand strong, then you can merge the two and have full access to your creativity.<br /><br />Remember, there is always at least one person who can beat any given odds. No reason it can&#039;t be me, or you. We&#039;re all the same consciousness with different bodies and different experiences, which is just to say different perspectives.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame you&#039;ve ceased relating to my thoughts, since they&#039;ve finally broken me through into total consciousness. Remember, LSD is just a permission slip to let you be more you - you can activate all the same pathways with intent if you believe you can and you can feel it.<br /><br /><br />Also, a question:<br />How is aaaannnyyyyttthhhhiiiinnnnggg in this topic further out there than the stuff I was spouting before? This topic is purely internal - get in touch with your subconscious and become one with it. That&#039;s actually about the sanest insight I&#039;ve had after the mess of everything else.

				And what&#039;s the point of tripping if you&#039;re gonna come down every time? That turns it into a temporary escape. I took it to fix myself and move more into reality.<br /><br />To each their own, but I can&#039;t believe we came here to escape, and I can&#039;t believe that LSD made itself known just to whisk us away. It asked me if I was ready to leave my love, go off and explore the higher realms, and I said &quot;No, I want to live this life here with her.&quot; That was when I stopped coming down. When I stopped running. Stopped escaping. Stopped being afraid of myself, stopped being afraid to make new mistakes.<br /><br />To lose is more than hesitate.<br /><br />LSD brings beautiful feelings. If you could keep every benefit and let go of everything that impairs functions like driving and communicating, wouldn&#039;t you?

				Anyway, I just came here to let you all know that I cured myself of mental dis-ease and found joy in life itself, no longer compelled to take LSD except to reward myself for how my work is going to go, but it seems that just doesn&#039;t resonate here.<br /><br />I&#039;m wiping my flash drive, I won&#039;t be back. It&#039;s not just that the reaction was both underwhelming and disappointing - I&#039;m actually busy living my life as a part of offline society, and I really just don&#039;t have time for this now.<br /><br />I hope that all of you here who still limit and judge yourselves subconsciously will find the path to unconditional love for yourself. There is no addiction there - no need. Only want, and when you get it just right you always have what you want when you want it.<br /><br />&quot;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.&quot;

				I found a moment in my day and couldn&#039;t not stop by the community that brought me so much joy. Also, the universe very clearly directed me here - it&#039;s pretty nifty how it&#039;s been speaking to me both inside and outside my head. (I found the cap to my flash drive on the couch in the living room instead of my room, so I got on SR to check the clearing of the last of my funds but it was down, directing me to the forum. My vpn, Tor, SR, and the forum all connected about a billion times faster than normal as though to confirm I was doing as I was supposed to. Say coincidence if you like, but coincidence doesn&#039;t mean meaningless.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114115.msg795624#msg795624">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on February 05, 2013, 09:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve been avoiding this topic.&nbsp; I kind of regret saying what I did.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry about that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Appreciated.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You remember when I told you that I couldn&#039;t prove you wrong?&nbsp; Well... that&#039;s not true anymore.&nbsp; &quot;We&#039;re all one consciousness.&quot;&nbsp; My friend...

I mean, really, that was the most disappointing part of your post. All that means is that you haven&#039;t learned yet. There are many perspectives which lead one to see that we are all one consciousness, such as that the human species is itself conscious, or that core human consciousness is trying on all possible bodies in all possible situations to find all possible paths to enlightenment. There&#039;s an ancient greeting that goes something like &quot;Hi, I&#039;m another version of you.&quot; Our egos are just roles we take on to have complex and meaningful experience. We manifest aspects of our total self outside of our self for easier exploration of our self. Hell, I&#039;ve manifested two cats into my experience who directly reflected me - my cat nature externalized - and who unmanifested in different ways when I no longer needed them and could learn more from the way they left. Since then I&#039;ve seen one of them prancing about on one of my trips when the LSD dissociated that part of me again so I would know he was still with me. So yeah, personal, physical experience has showed me that we are one consciousness.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It sounds like... some cliche, frankly.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well that&#039;s because the enlightened have known since forever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But to be clear, I&#039;m not saying your thoughts are illogical or not of worth or something like that.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t psychotic or ill, that&#039;s not at all what I meant.&nbsp; But you&#039;re saying things that I don&#039;t believe and that I feel can be proven incorrect.&nbsp; I&#039;m just being honest -- I don&#039;t want to argue with you or anything.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nothing can be proven. There is no such thing as a fact, only theories backed by many, many independent trials.<br />Also, I would likely be classified as a high-functioning schizophrenic. Or something along those lines.

Deciding that someone else&#039;s is wrong simply because you do not understand it only limits your own potential for learning.

				Oh, also, this part&#039;s really fun:<br />The brain is the first physical manifestation of your subconsciousness. It starts actions before you&#039;re consciously aware, by whole seconds according to an experiment done by someone somewhere.<br />The body is the next physical manifestation of the next deeper layer of your subconsciousness.<br />Society is the next. Then the world. The solar system. The galaxy. The universe. The more of your subconscious you get in touch with, the more you&#039;ll flow with all of reality. Recently I&#039;ve been compelled to watch shows and movies I knew nothing about only to find a perfect metaphor for my own personal experience. It&#039;s been a beautiful and mind-blowing experience. I can&#039;t watch TV without learning about myself and my relationships. I&#039;ve had people around me ask the questions I ignored when I asked myself. I&#039;ve had loved ones respond to my more intense feelings from thousands of miles away, calling to try and get me to think before acting, and when I listened it went well and when I didn&#039;t something fell apart. Feelings are the basis of telepathy, and just one more manifestation of support for the concept that we are all one consciousness.<br /><br />So, next time someone who&#039;s been spewing beautiful and mind-expanding ideas says something that doesn&#039;t click, try exploring it and asking questions before judging it wrong and saying &quot;Aw, you had such a good run going but then you tripped.&quot;

				Don&#039;t feel like spamming to 50 to post elsewhere, so I&#039;ll say it here!<br /><br />Lucy helps with relating things! So the best ANYTHING to do while tripping with Lucy is anything you relate to really well, and anything you dearly wish to relate to! There&#039;s no single answer! Lucy is appropriate for EVERY situation that you can handle when you want to relate more powerfully! (Anyone who absolutely HATES and DESPISES the idea of relating to electronic music actually would NOT enjoy it at all! Crazy right?! There&#039;s always a chance the Lucy will distract them from the hate enough to enjoy it though. =) )

				I didn&#039;t explain because I kind of thought it was self evident, honestly: if we&#039;re all one consciousness, then why can I sense my thoughts but not yours or anyone elses?&nbsp; If your answer is &quot;you can,&quot; then why is that not able to be shown in a controlled environment like a lab setting?<br /><br />If we were all one consciousness, surely there would be some kind of experiment that would provide evidence of that -- I mean if there isn&#039;t any way we can test it, if there&#039;s no experiment that could reveal the truth of it, then even if it&#039;s a fact it has no effect on our reality/universe.&nbsp; Which is basically the same thing as saying it doesn&#039;t exist, i.e. it&#039;s not true.<br /><br />Without some sort of experimental evidence, it&#039;s as likely a conjecture as Santa Claus marrying the Easter Bunny.&nbsp; There&#039;s no experimental evidence of that either.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that I&#039;m likely going to come off as aggressive or condescending.&nbsp; That&#039;s not how I want to sound, but I&#039;m not sure how else to illustrate how certain I am that you&#039;re wrong.<br />

				Moms and their kids. Twins. Both have a history of demonstrating a degree of telepathy.<br /><br />Your beliefs manifest your reality. Your experience is a mirror. You can&#039;t expect your reflection to wave before you do - you have to change first. If you believe in something that doesn&#039;t work, you&#039;ll manifest something that doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />It&#039;s kinda funny that I just pointed out clear examples from my own experience and instead of saying &quot;Hmm, lemme explore this and see if I can experience it myself,&quot; you say &quot;No one else is proving it, so no matter what you&#039;ve experienced you&#039;re just wrong.&quot;<br /><br />I mean, really. You can&#039;t count on anyone outside of yourself to prove anything for you.<br /><br />EVERYTHING I&#039;M SAYING HAS HAD DIRECT EFFECT ON MY REALITY. I accepted the possibility, and then it was confirmed for me!<br /><br />Do you know why you&#039;re coming off as condescending, and why you know it? Because you know that if you saw the first evidence of something, and tried to say coincidence, then saw more and more until it felt like a slap in the face and finally decided it was true, and then someone came along and said you were mistaken about your whole experience, you&#039;d feel like they were being pretty damn condescending. I can&#039;t even explain the mountain of personal experience I&#039;ve had vindicating my statements because it&#039;d give me away, but trust me, I have healthy skepticism and you&#039;re displaying pure cynicism.

				... are you really Typtap?&nbsp; Because you sound nothing like him.&nbsp; Every one is wrong sometimes.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; There&#039;s no shame in it, it&#039;s just part of being human.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;re taking my statements so personally?<br /><br />By the way, I already did what you suggest -- I read entire books about magick.&nbsp; I tried casting spells.&nbsp; I tried reading people&#039;s thoughts.&nbsp; Had them try reading mine.&nbsp; All that stuff.&nbsp; None of it did a goddamn thing.&nbsp; I read up on it, discovered that no one has ever documented a statistically significant finding when tested in a controlled environment, and decided it was all rubbish.&nbsp; You don&#039;t really think I&#039;d just assume something without testing it, do you?

				You&#039;re right, I&#039;m taking your statements too personally. My life has been moving really fast lately, I recently had some extra stresses added on and I feel like I should be doing more when I actually need to be relaxing and recovering from recent events before moving forward, and I lashed out here from stress which isn&#039;t relevant to the conversation.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t work to just cast spells. It&#039;s much more complicated than that. If you&#039;re not in touch with the first layer of your subconscious mind (in this context, the brain) how can you expect to directly manipulate the third (your surroundings)?<br /><br />If you don&#039;t actually relate to someone, don&#039;t know how to relate to them completely, how can you expect to get in their heads? I mean, really, it can&#039;t be forced. It comes with work, hard fucking work in one form or another, and determination, and diligence, and discipline. It takes knowing yourself really well. It only becomes apparent when you&#039;re actively aware of every impulse you&#039;re experiencing and where it&#039;s coming from.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had someone break their routine of never calling first to call me up after months of silence on my worst day in ages, and the first thing she said was &quot;Hey, I just had a really strong feeling that something was wrong so I needed to call and make sure you&#039;re okay.&quot;<br /><br />Sorry I lashed out, but I&#039;ve had people telling me my entire life what&#039;s real and what isn&#039;t and what I can do and what I can&#039;t and as I&#039;ve been turned around from thinking it&#039;s rubbish to -seeing it work- I&#039;ve just found it frustrating when someone seems to think they&#039;ve tried every way and done their best and decided it&#039;s rubbish for good. I mean, really, when I&#039;ve failed to make something work and someone else assured me it does if you do it right, I&#039;ve tried to figure out how I did it wrong instead of assuming they&#039;re wrong.<br /><br />So very much has been happening in my life lately that I&#039;m tired, very fucking tired, and I don&#039;t feel like I have any time to rest. I know I&#039;ve earned some time to sit back and breathe but I don&#039;t feel like I can and I let shit drive me up a wall when I get stressed out.<br /><br />So you know what? You don&#039;t want to find the way to flow with the reality around you, fine. Don&#039;t. But realize that just because you didn&#039;t make it work the ways that you did try doesn&#039;t mean you tried every way. Part of why I jumped is because I hear you saying &quot;No, I tried a few things a few ways and when it didn&#039;t click I decided to disregard anyone else&#039;s personal accounts, doesn&#039;t matter if they tried something different than I did and it seemed to work, if it didn&#039;t work my way it doesn&#039;t work.&quot;<br /><br />I didn&#039;t get my way from a book. I pieced together bits and pieces from wicca, and buddhism, and tai chi, and yoga, and relativity, and quantum mechanics, and sociology, and ecology, and astronomy, and the people in my life, and christianity, and all sorts of other sources. So you picked a few whole books and tried some spells and tried mind reading. Sounds like you did some reading and tried for results with none of the in between. Try piecing together your -entire life and everything in it- and see where that gets you. Try looking a lot deeper inside, especially at anything about you that scares you. Knowledge and understanding are potentially damaging without actual -insight-, into -yourself-.<br /><br />So, AGAIN. Next time, try asking questions about how someone arrived at a different result instead of saying they&#039;re wrong. Because you don&#039;t know the first two things about my life and what I&#039;ve dealt with to get here, and while I shouldn&#039;t have freaked the truth of the matter is that you&#039;re acting like your experience has told you everything you need to know that my experience is wrong. And I&#039;m not wrong about my reality. The evidence is mounted so high it&#039;d be ridiculous for me to think I might be.

				Sounds like the same Typtap to me, but an enlightened Typtap. Which is a good thing.<br /><br />I see more clarity in his speech and I know where he&#039;s coming from with these posts. I haven&#039;t gone through his drug experiences, but I do realize what he is talking about.<br /><br />Hey, what do you guys think, &quot;realization&quot; or &quot;learning&quot;?<br /><br />Both signposts leading to the same thing, but realization seems more accurate.

				I suppose it would be dishonest to leave these last few sentences out: in closing I refer you to my signature.&nbsp; I decided years ago that I&#039;d always choose Truth over comfort.&nbsp; If you&#039;re right, then so be it, I&#039;ve been wrong more than half my life.&nbsp; What a terrible waste of time that would&#039;ve been; the problem is that I just see no evidence whatsoever that you&#039;re right.&nbsp; In fact all the evidence that I&#039;m aware of suggests quite the opposite.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that we disagree, but again: truth, not comfort.

				It&#039;s not so much that you were wrong more than half your life, but that we&#039;re all &quot;wrong&quot; when we think we know and get more &quot;right&quot; as we seek to understand. All sorts of realities exist at once and our beliefs shift us through them. No matter what you&#039;ve believed, your entire life can be reflected on to help you shift into your own reality, so please don&#039;t think a single moment was ever wasted. I used to think that, then I saw how I could learn from those &quot;wasted&quot; moments even now.<br /><br />I&#039;m faaaar from perfect myself, and I have to say that I know I&#039;ve conducted myself poorly in this thread as well, but I am glad that I was finally able to realize that I needed to take the advice I was giving you and recognize that you&#039;re right about your reality and I&#039;m right about mine. I was reflecting back any negativity I accused you of pretty fully.<br /><br />No one will ever understand every facet; the very nature of infinite reality makes it impossible. The trick is to open up to a new level, get stable there like it is the top, then prepare to move up again.<br /><br /><br />What I&#039;m currently working on is coming back from the edge of my personal exploration to a balanced center where from I can relate to more people. As you can see, I&#039;ve still got some ways to go (infinite, in fact, falling towards the center along the golden spiral, since there will always be more different consciousnesses to relate to). At the same time I&#039;m also expanding further out into my personal reality, making it an interesting balancing act. Getting better at it.

				I hope you realize that if you actually succeed, I&#039;m going to ask for a finder&#039;s fee.&nbsp; Nothing greedy or anything, just a little somethin&#039;-somethin&#039;.&nbsp; After all, if you&#039;re right, you&#039;ll literally be a millionaire several times over :)

				Woohoo, everything is going splendidly except for my own opinion of my tangible results thus far, but I&#039;m well aware that I&#039;m still judging from the perspective of a society that firmly believes that only tangible results matter.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve got a youtube channel going. Not gonna link it since it links to me and I&#039;ve spouted off about lots of drug receipt and use here, just wanted to give you all a heads up that it&#039;s there so you can look for it if you feel lucky. =)<br /><br />SS - If/when that comes to fruition I&#039;ll be more than happy to give you a substantial finder&#039;s fee.
