				Hi, I&#039;ve been on the road for quite some time as a buyer (just occasional benzos and pain meds). Usually I obtain my BTC via BitInstant with false info as not to be tracked. <br /><br />A few days ago I decided I would try one of these BTC for MoneyPak services instead as it&#039;s easier. I have purchased pain meds from this seller before (just recently, actually) and everything arrived perfectly - he even gave me extras. He has a GDMP for BTC service available as well, and has good reviews on this service. I decided to try it. I purchased the MP and sent him the number in the address box. Later he messages me and says that its already been used. <br /><br />Basically I want your opinions.. do you think he took the money and ran? What else could have happened? I checked the balance on the MP and it is $0.00 so somebody definitely made off with my money.. I didn&#039;t use PGP when I sent the info.. could that have been my mistake? Keep in mind that he has had others post 5/5 reviews about his MoneyPak to BTC service since this has happened to me.. I&#039;ve messaged him but he has yet to respond to me (2 days ago). <br /><br />Any opinions or thoughts are welcome... if I need to elaborate on anything or shorten anything up let me know.

				Is it 4 heroin? He said the same thing about me and he won&#039;t reply to any of my emails or read them. I&#039;ve been buying a lot of stuff off him with moneypaks before this. I think he just stole $500 from me...&nbsp; :&#039;(

				&nbsp;::) No I meant the vendor&#039;s name is &#039;4 heroin&#039;, not that I was buying heroin. <br /><br />Read this. Don&#039;t panic yet. Seems to be an issue with Moneypak. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176873.msg1270674#msg1270674

				I&#039;ve checked it though and it says the balance is $0.00. I tried loading it to PayPal as well and PP informs me that there&#039;s insufficient funds.<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering if people who&#039;ve done this before noticed any mistakes I made or any alternatives that could have happen besides the vendor taking my cash. I just find it strange that there&#039;s others who have had success with his GDMP to BTC service after mine didn&#039;t work. Leads me to believe that maybe it isn&#039;t the vendor? I&#039;m trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.

				It sounds like you got scammed them.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I just bought another moneypak with $1 on it to be sure it wasn&#039;t just me and the card came up as invalid too. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on... ???

				I recently just bought bitcoin with Money Pak from moneyhoney and it all turned out fine. I think he may have scammed you because the card I just bought 2 days ago was able to be redeemed without any issues. However, the off chance that it was some error with Money Pak you could try calling them and duke it out over the phone with their support. Sorry man.

				Funny, the vendor I was referring to was 4 heroin as well. Here is a link to another thread<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176840.msg1270215#msg1270215
