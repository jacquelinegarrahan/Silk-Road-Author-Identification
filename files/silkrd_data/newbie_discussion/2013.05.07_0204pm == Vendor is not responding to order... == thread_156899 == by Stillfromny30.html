				I&#039;m not a newbie but apparently I can only&nbsp; post here. I placed a order Thursday with a well known vendor.&nbsp; I Realize from the mods that I have to wait 7 days to cancel the order so I can get my bit coins and order from someone else. My question is: this vendor is usually spot on, been here a very long time and shows he has been on today yet my message is still unread. Do you think this is cause for concern? It&#039;s just all very odd. It&#039;s been 6 days since I ordered and not a peep . Just says &quot;processing&quot; anyone else dealing with this?

				Well just wait one more day, then cancel the order. Maybe he is out of stock . Maybe he is drowning in a pile of messages. Had this before when they are out of stock or simply don&#039;t have time. You also don&#039;t know how many people are behind a single vendor account. Maybe it&#039;s just the guy that makes the listings logging in.<br />

				Good point catstalker, I didn&#039;t even think that someone else does the listings. I know with the recent events vendors are probably busy. I just was wondering if anyone else is dealing with such a delay. I would rather not cancel as long as he responds soon. <br />

				Regarding only being able to post here, new forum users (&lt;50 posts) can only post in the Newbie Discussion section. About the vendor, I would personally give them a few more days before canceling, but if they don&#039;t respond at all for a while, then it&#039;s well within your right to cancel. You never know what they might be going through. Best of luck!

				A lot of the good vendors are backed up these days from the issues SR has been experiencing. Exacerbated by the influx of messages from customers who are concerned about said back up...<br /><br />That said, a week in &quot;processing&quot; seems unusual and if there is another source and you have the option to cancel, then I don&#039;t really see the harm in doing so.

				I have a good vendor who took a week to get an order out that usually takes 48 hrs. I put it down to the chaos we have had to put up with recently. I just got me head down and waited and it was all good in the end, all be it a week late. Another vendors listings went down after i put the order in and SR replaced my coin straight away without question, even during all the down time. I hope this helps.

				Thank you everyone. I will give them more time...they have not logged in the forums either so I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re probably super busy, which is understandable. Like I said, I would rather not cancel even if I have to wait a week. I like this vendor and I would like to stick with him.
