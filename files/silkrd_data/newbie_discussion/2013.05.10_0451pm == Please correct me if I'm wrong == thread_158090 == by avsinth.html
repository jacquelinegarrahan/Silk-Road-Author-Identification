				I&#039;ve been doing some research so I can start using SR as a buyer as soon as possible. I&#039;d really appreciate if you could tell me if the following statements are right or wrong :)<br /><br />Regarding shipment:<br />- I should use my real name and real address (where I am living right now).<br />- Once it&#039;s delivered I should get the package out of the house as soon as possible since it could be a controlled delivery.<br /><br />Regarding security:<br />- I should use Tails or liberte.<br />- I should use PGP and escrow ALWAYS.<br /><br />Regarding bitcoins:<br /><br />I&#039;m really confused about this. I live in western Europe, how should I proceed? I thought of using mtgox and then send the bitcoins to an e-wallet but I think mtgox has to verify your identity and it is not anonymous at all. I&#039;ve read that I should always get BTC anonymously, but how? doesn&#039;t it become anonymous the moment it is put into an e-wallet?<br /><br />

				Couple things...<br /><br />1.)Use your real name.&nbsp; It will look much more suspicious if you are ordering to your house using a fake name, and it may not even come since the post office has a record of the names that live at certain addresses.<br />2.)If you don&#039;t want to use your home address, use a PO Box.&nbsp; The only problem with a PO box, is you have to sign up for it, and then go to wherever it is located, and get your package.<br />3.)Yes, use PGP and stay in escrow ALWAYS.&nbsp; There is no reason to send your personal information through the web without encryption.<br />4.)Bitcoins ARE NOT ILLEGAL!!!!&nbsp; I actually have my personal bank account tied to coinbase, and just send the coins to another wallet before moving them to SR (which in my opinion, seems to be unnecessary....SR tumbles your coins anyway)<br /><br />I am in no way a pro (only ordered 4 times so far, received 2).&nbsp; What I&#039;ve found to be the biggest issue, is finding vendors that aren&#039;t going to try and scam you.&nbsp; The other big issue for me...is the waiting game.&nbsp; I find myself leaving work every day to go home and check my mail (full of excitement/anxiety), only to find it&#039;s not there, then going back to work depressed for the rest of the day.

Check out localbitcoins.com to find a real life bitcoin dealer where you can use cash. I also recommend against tying bitcoins to your bank account, and accessing your bitcoin wallet with your real IP address (always use TOR, or an anonymous computer, or a VPN).<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about controlled deliveries in Europe, they don&#039;t do that kind of shenanigans there. Regarding fake names, not every country keeps a record of who is living where. If you send yourself some letters with a fake name and receive them without any problem, then that fake name is okay. But always try to send yourself letters before ordering!

				Your statements are pretty sound and safe, and don&#039;t worry a hell of a lot about the anonymity of buying bitcoins. There are hundreds of legitimate reasons for buying them, more and more shops are actually even beginning to accept them as payment.<br /><br />Still, read through the buyers guide and wiki

It&#039;s a pain to work with, I don&#039;t miss it one bit. There&#039;s no forums, almost no documentation or support, and you need to be extremely tech savvy to use it properly. Note the keyword, properly. Anyone can boot it, but unless you really know what the fuck you&#039;re doing, it&#039;s better to find something actively supported IMO.<br /><br />As far as the more anonymous, the only noticeable difference from what I gathered was the persistent entry guards in Liberte. Some noob with two posts who&#039;s asking raw questions isn&#039;t exactly Liberte material IMO, he&#039;s better off with TAILS, or even just TOR really. <br /><br />There are hundreds of much-more nuanced discussions in here about the merits of TAILS vs Liberte, and they all come back to persistent entry guards.<br /><br /><br /><br />
