				Seeing as I can&#039;t post in the big boy forums, thought I&#039;d ask mods/experienced buyers that might cruise through here:<br /><br />Is FredtheBaker a legit vendor for LSD from his UK distro? I was interested in his 200ug blotters, but having read the recent forum reviews on his Valium/MDMA shipments, customer service and product quality of benzos, I&#039;m not sure whether I should be starting one of my first few small transactions with him for his LSD..<br /><br />I know it&#039;s only small fry cash for 2 or 3 blotters, but I&#039;m pretty poor as fuck at the moment, and have been scammed by a domestic vendor once before (AUS).... So fairly bitter about SR LSD experiences<br /><br />Any tips for great LSD vendors who are trustworthy and cheap? Or should I be rolling with FTB?<br /><br />Fucking hate being poor :(<br /><br />Thanks in advance

I just did one this weekend, and if it was LSD at all, it was a very low dose. No visuals, not much buzz, and in six hours I was pretty much straight again. Very disappointed - I&#039;ll try elsewhere next time...
