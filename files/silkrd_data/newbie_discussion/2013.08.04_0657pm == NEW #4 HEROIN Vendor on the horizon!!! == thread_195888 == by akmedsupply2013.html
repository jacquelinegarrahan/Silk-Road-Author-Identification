				Medsman has really helped me out tremendously when other wouldnt and i was one of the lucky ones to get his first batch of samples from his #4 heroin and it compares to the top two on here maybe better , very vinegary smell, the taste was raw as hell and the weight was on as well as stealth vaccum sealed was perfection, truly strong as hell and medsman has every express order out to you and you actually get it next day!!! Express means express and he treats you like an equal person not like some moron that most other vendors treat you like!!!! thanks medsman

				I was lucky enough to try his first initial batch and it was some of the strongest and most smooth i have ever had in my life!!! got my order in less than 24 hours and was treated like a person and the customer service was great as i wrote asking 50 questions and most other vendors would ban you for just asking simple questions. I suggest all of you newbies look at his profile and he claims next week well this week coming he will have another batch of #4 H in stock and he is well worth the money. Don&#039;t expect anyone advertising for less than 190.00 om silk road to have anything worth a damn as it will be garbage!! We have tried them all and this vendor will be a super star after he gets the next batch out so you guys check him out and keep a look out for him and oh yeah he has the best xanax we have ever tried in our lives!!! Thanks Medsman for being such a kind and considerate person and you definitely have earned our business which averages a good bit.<br />Cat
