Chanses are very small. It depends on how much you order and which countries you are talking about also.

				If the vendor used a real address like they should be then some unsuspecting person or company is going to receive your order.

				Ok so if its a fake adress it goes to a place called dead mail. Don&#039;t quaote me on name but when it goes thier it is the only place someone is legally allowed to open a package without a warrent.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of the time they are opening it to try to get it to the reciever and don&#039;t have creul intinsions.&nbsp; But if they find a pile of mushrooms they report it. <br /><br />So if ur name is thier or adress is miss written it won&#039;t take long for them to find who u are. Id recommend cleaning out ur residence and car. Just to be safe for a couple of months.<br /><br />My neighbor is a post office worker so I learn some stuff from him.
