				Using coinapult, after a bitinstant money gram I accidentally sent my bitcoins to xxxxxx@tormail.com instead of tormail.org. <br /><br />I realize I am retarded.<br /><br />Now there is no email addresses for @tormail.com, there&#039;s only @tormail.org. <br /><br />But my bitcoins are gone. I&#039;ve emailed coinapult and am awaiting a response. <br /><br />Basically am I fucked or will I get my bitcoins back since a @tormail.com doesn&#039;t exist?<br /><br />Thanks

				tormail.com absolutely exists. It&#039;s a domain. Check for yourself.<br /><br />Since there&#039;s no BTC wallet associated with the xxxx@tormail.com you had Coinpault send it to, they will notice that in their system and resolve the issue. BTC can not be sent to something that doesn&#039;t exist. You know? I&#039;m not sure how Coinpault is setup internally, but I&#039;m positive they have a system in place for coins being sent to an email address that has no BTC wallet tied to it.<br /><br />Chill out, Coinpault will most likely fix your issue.

				okay thankyou color black, as you can see this is my first post and im relatively new to this. Just freakin out a bit lol, hopefully will resolve. If not, I&#039;m going to be much more careful next time and store it in an e-wallet instead. I thought that you could store bitcoins in emails but is that not correct? Going to have to set up a wallet.

				also, i sent out an email to the @tormail.com address and I got that message that said &quot;delivery status notification (failure)&quot; that it is an unknown address and is undeliverable so obviously even if @tormail.com does exist, the email i specifically sent it to doesn&#039;t. Hoping they resolve this sooner than later <br /><br />thanks again

				Took my sweet ass time trying to learn everything before touching anything and after all that I make this retardedly miniscule mistake. Also realize how retarded my responses to colorblack are.<br /><br />Sadly haven&#039;t gotten a response back from coinapult yet <br /><br />Don&#039;t know how good support is over there but I did read that after 30 days if the coins aren&#039;t claimed then I&#039;ll receive an email to get them back. <br /><br />Worst comes to worst in 30 days I&#039;ll have them. As volatile as bitcoins are, a skyrocket the next month would be most pleasing. <br /><br />

				Did you put a real sent from address in coinapult?&nbsp; The coins will get sent to that after 30 days.
