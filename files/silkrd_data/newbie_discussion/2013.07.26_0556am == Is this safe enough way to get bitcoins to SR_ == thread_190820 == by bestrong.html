				Hello everyone, I&#039;m new to SR and the forums. I&#039;ve been trying to find out what is the best way to get money to SR and would like to know your opinion if what I&#039;m about to do is safe/anonymous enough.<br /><br />1. localbitcoins.com - Since I can&#039;t do a cash deposit from where I live I&#039;m thinking of doing a bank transfer which isn&#039;t anonymous at all but bitcoins are legal anyway.<br />2. Send my bitcoins from localbitcoins.com to an account on www.bitcoinfog.com/ - that should shuffle my coins. They have a fee of 1%-3%<br />3. transfer from bitcoinfog to silkroad wallet.<br /><br />I&#039;d appreciate any thoughts on this matter. Maybe there is a cheaper or safer way to do things I&#039;m not aware of.

				local can work well, but you have to confront someone face to face however I&#039;d assume most local BTC vendors are pretty discrete, obviously act professional and have a valid excuse in case it comes up in conversation (such as investment interests in an emerging currency)&nbsp;

				There&#039;s some other exchange sites that require less personal information than mtgox that you can use, some internet research can bring you to a few reputable ones. <br />

				Finding a personal seller online from one of the bitcoin forums can work very well too, just make sure they are reputable because you will mostly likely have to pay up front. If you find someone with good rep this method works %99 of the time although you&#039;ll have to use a payment method such as money pack or dwolla

				There are also usually some listings on SR that supply BTC for alternative forms of payment (usually something like money pack) check out of the currency section of the road, just be careful and also stay anonymous, I try to avoid attaching any bank or paypal transfers, even though BTC is legal, it&#039;s not something I&#039;d like to associate my personal info with, that&#039;s just me, really depends on what your doing with them.

				Thanks for the replies<br />Can someone explain how this blockchain works?<br />Also I can&#039;t use moneypak or dwolla... and no local btc dealers in my area. <br />It seems the only way for me is to use bank transfer to get btc and shuffle it somewhere.<br />Any other ideas?
