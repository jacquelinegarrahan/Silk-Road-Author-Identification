				So I placed an Order for 1 gram Peruvian China White Heroin RAW. It took 2 days to arrive with overnight shipping (ordered Wednesday afternoon received Friday afternoon). Vendor had good communication. I was asked to FE early for which I did since I had ordered a few times in the past with this vendor and was happy. <br /><br />Packaging: {1 out of 5} <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was a very lacking part of the order, while i understand he offers a more stealth shipping option for more money i would not assume that without it the shipping would be terrible.. The product was simply &quot;tossed&quot; into and open envelope and folded and stored into another larger envelope. this allowed the D to shift around fall into cracks and leak out of the sides. It was all over and i was very frustrated. At the least it should have been in a baggy and or vacumed sealed.<br /><br />Weight: {5 out of 5} <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spot on, though my scale is cheap i read 1.200 grams. So possibly overweight! :)<br /><br />Quality of product: {3.5 out of 5} <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No smell to it.. The color is a tan one like beach sand. it dissolved excellent in the water with little to no remaining. The initial rush was lacking for sure. The High was descent. It just did not hit the spot for me personally, i like to smell and taste it when i IV and this did not happen. By no means am i upset just not blown away, its meh. Suboxone a few days ago doesn&#039;t help my case either. I would still have to say that my favorite is gotsitall, his i love and is euphoric and breaks through suboxone the same amount of days that i did today.<br /><br />overall i would rate this transaction a 7/10 not totally but a little bit misleading maybe?...<br />
