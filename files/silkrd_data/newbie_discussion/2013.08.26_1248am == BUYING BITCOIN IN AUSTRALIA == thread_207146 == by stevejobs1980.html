				I used LocalBitcoins.com - was very quick and easy - and then transferred them between a few eWallets before transferring to my SR wallet. Yet to make my first purchase though, still getting the hang of PGP.

Not many people can wash their coins and with a company like CoinJar.io they have a policy that says they will give over any information if a court order is presented to them.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw

				I started out using spendbitcoins before switching to coinjar after discovering they only charge 2% compared to spendbitcoin&#039;s 10%. I made the mistake of using bitcoinsnow about 5-6 weeks ago and am STILL trying to get my money refunded after they had trouble with the Commonwealth bank and MT Gox. Talk about being fucked around!, very pissed off. <br />Now Coinjar is all I use, although I does require u to transfer it out of your coinjar wallet into your own wallet.

				1# Purchase Bitcoins with CoinJar.io using OTC method.<br />2# Deposit the exact amount of money needed for the tansaction. ( Will speed things up )<br />3# Bitcoins are ready for use in the CoinJar.io cloud based wallet.<br />4# Transfer your Bitcoins to a BitFog address and let them wash your coins.<br />5# Transfer your coins out of BitFog to either your SilkRoad address or your own personal wallet.<br /><br />CoinJar.io costs 2% and BitFog has a max of 3%.<br /><br />Remember to never keep to many coins left in your SilkRoad wallet, a personal wallet ensures that you do not have to rely any cloud / 3rd party based system to trust. Set a backup Bitcoin address in your SilkRoad account settings incase anything happens.<br /><br />LocalBitcoins.com would also work in the exact same way, but some might say that needing to use a valid mobile number to use their service is a security risk.<br /><br />Just like CoinJar.io you still need to create an account on LocalBitcoins.com for things to work without a hitch in regards to refunds and what not.<br /><br />Same goes for SpendBitcoins.com I had to create an account when the teller wrote down the wrong reansaction ID when doing an OTC buy.<br /><br />You could use burner mobile to use with CoinJar.io if you must, but I belive that as long as you wash the coins you shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry.<br /><br />I personally use a website like http://www.honestbeef.com.au/ to purchase my bulk meat products which is a valid place to spend a lot of Bitcoins at, so using sites like this can be used as a valid reason as to why you are using CoinJar.io to purchase Bitcoins.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry about this whole spewl, I&#039;m just trying to help others find an answer that suits them the best and honestly SpendBitcoins.com charging 10% is a little way to high.<br /><br />May math also be wrong but just from the top of my head MtGox AUD/BTC average and/or high + 10% doesn&#039;t equal what they display on their page so I&#039;m not sure what their source is.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />-bbw
