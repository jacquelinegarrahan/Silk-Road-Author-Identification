				Why is LSD so expensive on silk road? I have noticed some of the other drugs being a little higher than street price and some being cheaper than street price. But the LSD prices seem way higher than the street prices in the US. Cheapest sheet is like $475 and thats about 175 more than street price.

				LSD on the road isn&#039;t too expensive in my opinion. In my area, I&#039;ve never come across genuine LSD. I&#039;ve only found DOI and 2c-i/2c-5. For a little extra I can know it&#039;s real stuff on SR. <br />Oh, and you can get 10 hits of ~200ug lsd from Tessellated for $140. That&#039;s $14/tab. That&#039;s a nice price imo.

				street lsd is no longer lsd.. tis a tragedy of the times.<br /><br />I don&#039;t paying for example $14 a hit of acid, as long as it&#039;s real.<br /><br />However, I think this pretty much kills the market of sharing it with the world.. It&#039;s impossible to match prices of 2ci or other RC.

				all the old dudes i talk say that acid was a dollar a hit back in the day and around 25-30 dollars a sheet... the dollar has become at the bare minimum four time that now but that is still nice... think the reason for selling acid went from sharing the experience to making money (for smack possibly =P jk ----&gt;) as the dead followers have diminished... remember they were responsible for a great deal of it...&nbsp; &nbsp;not sure if im misinformed but this has always been my thought... most times i come across real stuff i pay 15... i suppose its the Unicorn Tax =)

				Acid on the road IS more expensive than most would expect. But hey, there are plenty of reasons why.<br /><br />Reason 1:<br />The price is still really good! You can get $15 a tab and lower. For an 8 hour, mind expanding trip that&#039;s not bad at all. Think about how much coke costs for how long it lasts.<br /><br />Reason 2: <br />LSD is a fragile molecule :(. Unfortunately pretty much everything in the world hates LSD (poor guy). Most water (due to chlorine, impurities, etc) destroys it instantly. Air destroys it, heat destroys it, even light destroys it. I would say time does as well but any decent physicist would yell at me and tell me entropy destroys everything (and that time doesn&#039;t really exist). This means you have to sell fast, in bulk, and ship properly. These, unfortunately, contribute to higher costs and thus higher prices.<br /><br />Reason 3:<br />The stuff you&#039;re getting is probably a much higher quality than you can find on the street. Most sellers here truly pride themselves on the quality of their products. You are much more likely to get exactly what you paid for instead of a cut, or substituted product. Word of mouth has a lot more impact here than it does on the street, giving the buyer a lot more power than they would have otherwise. Price goes up with quality.<br /><br />Reason 4:<br />Overhead. It costs money to sell on SR. You pay a modest fee, you have to deal with scammers, and you don&#039;t have a small contingency of assholes that you can rip off to increase your profit margins. You also have to pay to ship, and your money is probably tied up in escrow for a while.<br /><br />Reason 5:<br />People are (usually) trying to make a profit. A lot of the super cheap LSD dealers you hear about are motivated by values that aren&#039;t based on profit. They see it as a moral obligation to distribute LSD as a pseudo-non-profit organization. I&#039;m as cynical as the next guy but when you see people at festivals wandering around offering free doses en masse it becomes pretty evident.<br /><br />For all of these reasons LSD is a little more expensive than the tiny prices some people have heard rumored on the streets. This is, however, a very pure, competitive market. These prices are representative of one of the (few?) ways capitalism can be a good thing. So hey, try out some of the stuff here for yourself. If a seller gets enough volume they can drop their prices.

				Recently because of the avengers things have gotten better. My first order on SR was an Unknown RC sold by a member with good stats who did not know it was RC to begin with he never had it tested. Just makes you think how many people on the street pay this cheaper price for god knows what chemical. At least here there are people setup to test and recommend to prevent people being ripped off. Since the avengers started so far I have been satisfied and happy. Puts your mind at ease at least it&#039;s been randomly tested throughout the vendors time on SR. There are daily updates most of the time. Buy from any of the star vendors and you are safe, they all have to follow escrow (according to avengers requirements to b recognized as STAR status) and if you have to order from an ok vendor, read reviews and use best judgment, if your savvy enough to get on SR then take some time and read before rushing into things. Have a swell day :)<br /><br />Pink Floyd - echoes

				I&#039;ll say this, Oxford Maine, in the US, mid eighties, outdoor dead show, tents everywhere, small dirt strip on the side of the camping area big enough so a cessna could land, and it did.&nbsp; There was LE there, but they were just directing traffic.&nbsp; The sheets there were 40$usd, if you got 10 sheets, that was 350$.&nbsp; From there we went back to small city, it was strips of 10 were 30$, 25 for 50, and sheets for $100. We weren&#039;t greedy, but that was our markup. Still made plenty and gave people great product.&nbsp; LSD should really be the cheapest drug because of the amount you get off one ounce of liquid, and the actual cost of making it.&nbsp; Its unreal.&nbsp; &nbsp; Get close to the chemist and you&#039;ll see what the real deal is.&nbsp; Even these days, the trips shouldn&#039;t cost all this money.&nbsp; Prices seem way high.&nbsp;

				I guess it depends where your street is geographically located.<br />Around here you pay $20-25 per hit and it is never full strength.<br /><br />The SR&#039;s LSD prices and crowd-sourced confirmation of quality looks great from this end.&nbsp; ;D

				Seriously. I&#039;m off a 25-C NBOMe trip, and it was NOTHING like acid, but had I never taken LSD before would I know the difference? No, I would not.<br /><br />A reputation-based economy, where buyers are free to shop around. It&#039;s the only protection, and we have it here. Hook yourself up with a dependable vendor, anwyere.

				Hi. Last year I spent over four months looking for acid throughout the UK, and I have many contacts. After countless phone calls, and visits to old friends in many different towns and city&#039;s, I found nothing. I decided to google it, and up pops a wiki on SR, JACKPOT! If you&#039;re anything like me, you ought to think of yourself as lucky, that you can actually get it. LSD is not easy to make, it takes time.<br />I have bought of a couple of vendors so far, the last from Lucydrop, good acid at a reasonable price.<br />I hope you don&#039;t think I am being an ass with you, I just think that if you want quality, it&#039;s like everything else, you have to pay for it.<br /><br />Peace.<br />

				It&#039;s a seller&#039;s market? Most people who can&#039;t find it will pay a premium, however it is ridiculously expensive. It&#039;s a circle drug so you have to make the right friends which means going out and meeting people. That doesn&#039;t mean finding a dealer, because they don&#039;t have any incentive to sell you the real deal or if they&#039;re only selling strips you&#039;ll still pay a markup. If you meet the right people though you&#039;ll notice the quality of things like mdma, mda, and acid will not only increase but become very cheap. The price of acid hasn&#039;t really changed and the quality hasn&#039;t really either but after being handled and not stored properly it just degrades. My biggest pet peeve is people laying blotter with a vial. But if you look at heroin or coke for example I am sure the quality maybe better than your average street dealer here, but the same thing applies. If you&#039;re just getting dime bags how good did you think it was going to be? If you actually invest time into it though quality will go up and price will drop unless you&#039;re just too many steps removed.

				you can get $6 hits from lucydrop if you buy 50 at a time.<br /><br />But more importantly, I think LSD is one of those drugs that needs a price hike. I mean, hits were 2 bucks back in the late seventies/early eighties. Then five bucks forever. Everyone still wants to pay five. But think about it. A g of coke on the street will keep you high for about 8 hrs if you&#039;re not a feind. That costs between 50 and 75 bucks. a g of weed will keep you high for about the same amount of time if it&#039;s good - still about 15 to 20 bucks. but the psycodellics like shrooms and lsd are cheap as fuck when you can find them. an oz of shrooms (which would keep me high for about three weeks) can be bought for about 200 bucks. one hit of lsd (which keeps me high for at LEAST 5 hrs) costs AT MOST $20. I think we should be willing to pay $50 per hit of LSD.&nbsp; it keeps you high and loving life all night and it&#039;s a wonderful love drug. if we would get off our cheap asses and pay what it&#039;s worth, I think we would find that it would suddenly become a whole lot easier to find. Imagine that?! LSD as easy to score as weed? might be worth the extra bucks, huh?

				Theres seems to be an LSD &quot;drought&quot;, Typically if you know the right people you should be able to get sheets for like 200-300; This also includes vials.

Usually I&#039;m taking 4-5. So hopefully I&#039;m misunderstanding and you&#039;re not suggesting I should be spending $200-$250 per trip, cause that&#039;s when I find a new drug.

				It does suck that LSD is so expensive these days. Like people were saying I remember in the 90s when LSD was 5 bucks a hit or like 200 a sheet. Those were the days! But even though theres been a massive jump in price I&#039;m still willing to pay it for the amazing experience it gives you. Paying so much does mean I&#039;ll have less LSD trips a year and thats not a big deal when cubensis mushrooms are still at reasonable prices.

				In Oz, it is pretty cheap however it used to be cheaper on SR - currently I buy bout 500 off LD for around $8ea instead of around $5ea like it used to be. I sell them all day though for $30ea in groups of 10 so its still worth it ;)

				LSD isn&#039;t as commonly made as it once as plain and simple. It&#039;s just supply and demand. I have never found acid for less than $10 a hit and $80 a strip, and that acid has mostly sucked. I don&#039;t mind paying $15 a hit knowing that what I&#039;m getting is good quality and legit.

				I guess I&#039;ve just been lucky that I&#039;ve always gotten good acid (in person) for $5-7 a hit.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t have a source anymore, and I have a hard time with the prices on the road.&nbsp; I mean, even $8-10 a hit seems reasonable to me considering the convenience and reliability, but $15 a hit seems crazy expensive if I plan to take 2 or 3 hits at once.
