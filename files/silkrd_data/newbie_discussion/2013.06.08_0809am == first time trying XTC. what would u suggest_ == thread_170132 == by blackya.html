				Hi guys,<br />gonna try for the first time XTC.<br /><br />shortly about myself:<br />I used to be an experienced Coke user&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />So, I have 2 pills each containing about 100-120 mg MDMA. Medium strength.

				Very excited for you. I have fond memories of my first time. Do it right you&#039;ll always remember it. <br /><br />To answer your questions:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t do Xtc like coke, more is not better. <br /><br />2. Start with 1 and put the second far away/ out of reach. half way through your trip you&#039;ll want more and if your like me, will have no reasoning skills at all. watch a 2 hour movie if you dont feel it by the end you dont have good e. <br />&nbsp;<br />3. &quot;Dangers&quot; of XTC include Hyponatremia. If you drink too much water you&#039;ll mess up your water balance and lower the concentration of sodium and other electrolytes as well. This has been the reason for many deaths. <br /><br />Moral of the story don&#039;t drink too much. 500ml per hour is too much IMO. Drink ~2 max 3 water bottles during your trip. <br /><br />4. No sex sadly. XTC will make you love everything, want to fuck everything and be able to fuck nothing. limp dick like a motherfucker. fucking requires combo drugs, cialis viagra ect. dont try on your first time leave the first experience clean. <br /><br />5. Tuesday blues are a thing. Basically, Xtc unbalances the serotonin system in the brain leaving you with the sad blues the following week. It sounds worse than it is. Many people swear by taking 5-HTC tablets (OTC) to help drive serotonin release and production. <br /><br />Protecting your jaw muscles and teeth: if you dont do anything your jaw will hurt like a motherfucker. when your high on e your jaw just wants to shut it self i forget the reason why exactly but its a double edge sword because clenching your jaw will also feel great when your on it. a wet hand towel rolled up will be your best friend. It will protect your teeth, stop you from being able to bite down with your full strength and as a bonus you wont get pasty mouth.&nbsp; there&#039;s also some people who take i believe magnesium tables after the roll to help relax the jaw muscles never tried it though. <br /><br />6. -irritated, tired, confused-&nbsp; meh no, maybe definitely leave yourself a day for recovery.<br /><br />&nbsp;-&gt;not able to sleep=&gt; lol XTC= MDMA = MD-(not relavent to my point but makes xtc not a bitch drug like meth)-methamphetamine <br />as is it is an amphetamine compound. so no you wont feel like sleeping. <br />people use this stuff to be able to dance like beyonce for 8-10hrs straight. <br /><br />7. which ties in to weed. weed is like the&nbsp; &quot;i dont feel like being awake for the last part of the come down&quot; miracle drug. It will be your sleep time drug. no need for benzos. <br /><br />What else? hmmm<br /><br />Be in a safe environment, trip sitter perhaps if available. Private home out of public view best. <br /><br />Stay away from all forms of communications.

				try keep your rolls special. do it at events or special occasions. that way the magic will always stay as good. It wont mimic your first ever roll. Your first will always be the best! make it count man.<br /><br />before you roll take some Vit C and Magnesium (itll help for the common symtom of tension/jaw clenching) or just make sure you have some gum on you.<br /><br />you should post load on:<br /><br />5-htp (100-200mg)<br />vit c (1000mg)<br />ALA (alpha lipoic acid, its a lipid soluble vitamin able to cross the blood brain barrier)

				Tiny dick, sure, like other amphetamines... but when it gets hard it is as big as always and the sex is WONDERFUL. If you take too much, dick wont raise.<br />Just eat some bananas, oranges (C-vitamine and tryptophan rich food) the days before and take one pill at a time and maybe one other redosification of 1/2 pill (If you want more qty, do it, but a high dosage of mdma will not increase a lot the good effects and will increase a lot the secondary non wanted ones). But it is not good to redosify more than once.<br />If you do that and don&#039;t drink too much alcohol and you keep drinking water (like half a liter every hour) you&#039;ll enjoy the xtc and you will have no hangover<br /><br /><br />You will love it, but don&#039;t take it too often or you will lose all this pleasure when taking xtc.<br /><br />Enjoy your experience!!<br /><br />Sorry for my poor english

				100mg is plenty for the first time. Don&#039;t redose. Drink adequate water if you are moving or in a hot environment. Don&#039;t over-drink though, many people think they need to drink like a gallon of water when taking MDMA. - Absolutely bullshit. I drink around 0,5 litres per hour when I am at a rave or festival. - Never had a single incident. <br /><br />Eat a proper meal around 3-4 hours before you take the MDMA. If you have just had a meal before dropping MDMA, you might not feel the full effects. I once wasted 200mg completely by dropping just after I had eaten a kilo of pasta...<br /><br />MDMA can make some people uneasy, it will skyrocket your cortisol (stress hormone) levels and might induce some paranoia and uneasiness in some people (bugging out as some people say). This usually happens when the MDMA is just starting to work - If this happens to you, just tell yourself that it will pass and everything will be fine (and it 99% of the time will be fine :)).<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I hope you have got some outdoor place in your home or some friend to talk to. You will enjoy the nature and you&#039;ll be very active and talkative. If you are planning to stay all the time at home I bet you won&#039;t last the all travel, the home will be too small to you.

				Lucky bastard :) hope you&#039;ve got good gear.<br /><br />All I can say is that many of the questions you ask really depend on the individual. Some guys can fuck like rabbits on it, while others need viagra before they can...fuck like rabbits. I am somewhere in the middle - don&#039;t need viagra if I&#039;m not in a hurry, because it takes a good hour fooling around before sex becomes an option if you know what I mean. If you particularly want to get it on, I&#039;d have a viagra or cialis or whatever in my back pocket just in case you find yourself in the common male ecstasy paradox - you really really want to fuck but your downstairs department isn&#039;t cooperating. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be too paranoid about coming off the stuff, either, because this effects some more than others, and you&#039;ll need to see how you respond. A big night out can lay some low for days. Others bounce back chirpily the next day. When I was in my young 20s, I would have a big night out and go to work the next day, right as rain and feeling nothing but a little tired. These days, I&#039;m noticeably slower and fuzzy minded the day after, but I still reckon I pull up ok. And if you have a day off the day after, it&#039;s nice to have some benzos in case you&#039;re feeling the after effects. It&#039;s true that a nice benzo-fuelled lazy day post epic ecstasy session is pleasant whether you need it or not, but if you don&#039;t need it you probably shouldn&#039;t. If you want to be cautious, keep some on hand but only use them if you&#039;re having a bit of a rough time.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about a formula for hydration - some people die from dehydration, others from basically drowning themselves by obsessively hydrating to avoid dehydration - I&#039;ve never had a problem with safe levels of water intake while on ecstasy. Stay safe, have at least one straight friend keep an eye on you.<br /><br />So basically, drop your eccy - you&#039;re probably going to have a memorable time. Pay attention to your reactions; what you need and what you don&#039;t need for future reference. And ask a buddy to keep an eye on you.<br /><br />And I definitely second the advice of partaking rarely so that you can keep the magic. If you start using ecstasy regularly, it&#039;ll lose its sparkle pretty damn quickly.<br /><br />Have a great night! Lucky bastard, wish I could change places.

Medium strength. Should I start with one pill or 1,5?<br />I know I should drink like every hour about 0,5 l water or juice because of danger of dehydration.<br /><br />Will I be able to fuck chicks when on X&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D????<br /><br />When the effects of XTC wear off, will I be irritated, tired, confused, not able to sleep, etc? is there any bad come-down or hangover??? if yes, will weed help in this case or do I need some benzos?<br /><br />I will be very thankful if u share your opinions and suggestions<br /><br />Cheers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Couple questions: are you certain that what you have is just MDMA? You never can be certain short of lab testing; but you can test with basic reagents. I assume you know the source of your e, and sometimes that is enough.<br /><br />Couple things: if you are taking any seritonin acting antidepressants-- that will greatly diminish your trip.<br /><br />I think the most important piece of advice is to take the drug when you are in a good state of mind and in an environment you like.<br /><br />you should have some food in you, but don&#039;t eat a huge meal 10 minutes beforehand.<br /><br />You should not have much of comedown with the doses you described. In fact, when many people talk of having massive depression following a night of e - it is either because they did too much, or were using pills of questionable quality<br /><br />you should not have too much trouble having sex on e. people who say they cannot get hard on e is generally cause the e they have has been cut with speed, and that will cause vasoconstriction.<br /><br />MDMA is a type of amphetamine, so there are *some* CNS side effects-- like high blood pressure; vasoconstriction; increase in resting body temperature.<br /><br />and really don&#039;t stress your self out over minor things like what kind of water to drink. With the doses you are using, you will NOT experience such radical depletions in basic elements.<br /><br />the vast vast majority of people who have a bad experience with e can be summed up as:<br />1. the e was adulterated <br />2. they were using with other drugs<br />3. they were taking ridiculous amounts of the drug<br /><br /><br />also: e does cause the prostate to swell-- so you may find it hard to piss-- that is normal<br /><br /><br />
