				Many people need to be able to weigh things with finer resolution than that food scale in the kitchen, or a basic postal scale. I buy sterling silver and gold jewelry at garage/estate sales and auctions. I need a scale with a capacity of at least 100 grams, and a resolution of 0.01 gram.&nbsp; I also want to be able to weigh in other units (carat, pennyweight, ounce). Must be portable, battery powered, small enough for my jacket pocket.<br /><br />My go-to vendor has been www.oldwillknottscales.com<br /><br />Very well informed sales staff, super selection. Good prices on well known brands. Check out the &quot;Jewelry Scales&quot; section.&nbsp; The carry scales of every type and capacity, from $15 pocket scales to full on analytical balances. I&#039;ve purchased 3 scales from them over the past couple years, as well as a set of calibration weights.&nbsp; They have daily specials. Today&#039;s is a My Weigh F3, 100gm cap, 0.01gm resolution, pad, batteries, cal weight, for 23 bucks.<br /><br />I am not associated with them in any way other than as a satisfied customer.

				I always think it&#039;s a good idea to buy a weight set with it (costs about USD$20). Check the scale before you use it below, in the middle of, and above the weight you are aiming for.<br /><br />Even the cheap jewellery scales are good down to 10 mg if you test them before and after.

				Plutopete on here also sells great scales, along with other headshop material. You should also give him a look !

				Cool I&#039;ll check them out. I&#039;m usually only confident using volumetric analytical scales for accuracy, but I need various scales for different types of usage.
