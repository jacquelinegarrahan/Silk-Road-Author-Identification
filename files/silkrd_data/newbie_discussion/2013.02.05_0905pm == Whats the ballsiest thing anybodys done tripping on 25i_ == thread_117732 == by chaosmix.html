				Hey there,a few weeks ago i finally got around to trying 25i. its pretty cool, my eyes are big as fuck though and im pale so its easy to tell when im hot. other than that every now and then i will enjoy a cool trip w my bro and friends. im the grown up one out of the bunch so to speak. anyways whats the craziest/ballsiest thing anybodys ever done or seen someone do while tripping on bome? my lil bro took a shit in front of the neighbors mailbox at 5am and cover it with some fresh snow. he layed it perfectly so that if you werent paying attention and attempted to grab the mail,splat! i thought it was pretty funny considering it was 5am on a tuesday and he normally wouldnt do it unless he had some motivation. anybody else?

				One took a shit in the snow, the other jumped off a bridge, quite a contrast.<br />How similar is 25i to acid?

Between psychedelics, it&#039;s LSD&#039;s psycopath cousin who takes a shit in front of you mailbox. If you can, I recommend you do not befriend him too much, and if you do don&#039;t get too close to him. Only drug who left my with HPPD-like symptoms for weeks and annoying muscle twitches. I&#039;d rather have one good LSD experience than 10 25I-NBOMe &quot;trips&quot;.
