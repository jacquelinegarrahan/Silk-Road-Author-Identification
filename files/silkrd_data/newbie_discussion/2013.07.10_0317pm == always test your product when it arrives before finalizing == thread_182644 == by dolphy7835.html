				Especially regarding pills. Apparently there is an issue with vendors posting that they have usa made pills, but turn out to be counterfeits or low-grade overseas product. That&#039;s false advertising. I&#039;ve had this happen myself. Buyers need to see in feedback strength of pills/h/meth or whatever. I like vendors that have personally pic&#039;d their own product instead of copying them off of google images or wherever. Also, just in case of a mix-up try to resolve it privately with vendor rather than just fuck his stats up automatically. Unless of course you get some some straight-up fake shit. In that case; fuck&#039;em in the neck!

After all, lets be honest, the vendors pay for this service. Should a customer complain about the quality, quantity, or anything else they will be &quot;Blacklisted&quot;. What bullshit. <br />If each and every buyer would be honest with their feedback and understand that should they be &quot;blacklisted&quot; by some ripoff artist, they can always come up with another user name and try to find legitimate vendors. <br />BTW, that would thin the ranks of scammers and help insure legit vendors got all the business. This is &quot;Silkroad Anonymous Marketplace&quot;. The key word is not Anonymous, it&#039;s Marketplace. There&#039;s always going to be crooks, as &quot;buyers&quot; we need to expose and boycott scammers and support legitimate business people (and yes I know almost everything we&#039;re here for is illegal--in society, but we&#039;ve come here to work and trade outside &quot;society&quot;) <br />Let us who have come here for that purpose support the good and eliminate the bad.

				I understand what you are saying but it&#039;s either not polite to have a vendor wait a 3/4 days (or more) for you to test your product before you release payment.<br />The point here is always the same: having respect and responsibility. You, as a buyer, have the right to pay only for the product you did buy, but as a form of respect if you buy something then be sure to test the product ASAP (i.e. maximum 24 hours) so that if everything is correct you pay the seller. It doesn&#039;t take anything if you cannot test fully the product to just test a little part to see if everything is correct.<br /><br />Saying: &quot;don&#039;t release feedback until you test the product&quot; is perfectly fine... in a perfect world; sadly we are far from being in a perfect world here and if you don&#039;t add a little caveat explaining that you have to have respect to the seller and test the product immediately (and if you cannot then you should not buy or you have to accept the loss just in case, because it is YOUR problem if you bought a product that you cannot test and a vendor cannot be responsible for your problems) many buyers will simply do their sick affairs with leisure while the vendor is waiting for payment.

				True blackiris. I am pretty much able to test my product immediately almost everytime. 1 hour after package arrives i&#039;ll have &quot;tested&quot; it. Another hour is not tying up the vendors funds. 3 or 4 days to finalize? Respect and honesty with people are a 2 way street. If it will take that long until you can test product, then you definitely shouldn&#039;t hold up vendor&#039;s funds because of your schedule. I finalized right after i popped a couple of Vicodin&#039;s from a vendor no longer on here. Should have waited another hour, cuz they were fake as hell, and I definitely would not have finalized. <br /><br />Also; i&#039;ve heard of people getting something different than what they ordered and instead of immediately rushing to give the vendor bad feedback they settled the matter privately so as not to hurt the vendor&#039;s stats.

				Yes, you must test your product before finalizing. This should be common sense, unless you already have established history with your vendor. Even then, it&#039;s still recommended, as sometimes orders can get mixed up.

				I considered this and asked about it, I just got my first ever order.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my position. The pills have arrived. They were sent quickly. They look fine. Had I been out in a festival or pub or whatever I&#039;ve often had to buy on appearance alone. If I can hand over cash to randoms without anyone to recommend (often expensive for mediocre gear) them I can FINALIZE quickly on someone who sent quickly and who has amazing rep and reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to hold onto the cash once they&#039;ve arrived, you should do so immediately. Not wait for days. That&#039;s unfair. You&#039;d be howling if they marked IN TRANSIT days before they sent the gear wouldn&#039;t you?

				Well, for me, when I get the package I get so happy and graceful that I run to release the funds to the seller... Having done my research before buying and seeing that everything looks as it should, I finalize as soon as I can. Also I don&#039;t test the gear until a week or so (I plan ahead and buy accordingly) and buy only small quantities, so I prefer to finalize promptly and revisit the feedback later on.

				It will be hard to find a vendor willing to ship to a newbie without an early FE. For all they know they could ship the product out and the customer won&#039;t release any funds. My advice is to do detailed research on popular vendors with great reviews on the forums, and once you&#039;ve established a history on the road you can avoid the hassle of an early FE

				Thanks for posting this thread, I&#039;ve been wondering this to myself very recently.<br />I received an order within a couple of days, but upon just first-glance really, suspicions were raised.<br /><br />I noted such to the vendor, who assured me that... shoot, is it unfair to share too much detail?<br /><br />Anyway, in response I let the vendor know I tried it and agreed with some other feedback suggesting &quot;weakness&quot; re:potency.<br />But I feel a little guilty clinging to the finalization option, because from what I understand, once finalized, that&#039;s sort of it?
