				I believe both Limetless and JesusOfRave offer both services. <br /><br />Localbitcoins is good for finding vendors who will accept cash for coins, which is much better than selling them on localbitcoins, too much work plus most people want bank transfer for Localbitcoins, receive loads of cash to a bank account questions will be asked. Find a reliable vendor who you can sell to just below MtGox for CASH, no questions asked... I&#039;d assume.<br /><br />Most of the vendors will sell 2% below MtGox due to the fact they sell 10% above it, thus a 12% gain on your coins for them.

				I haven&#039;t seen the listing for Limitless in a while, but I do for SexyWax. It may seem like a steep price but it&#039;s very cheap considering that you actually make enough money to require washing it. I haven&#039;t bought these services myself. They&#039;re just suggestions.

				I feel like you are mixing up two different yet not completely unrelated issues here. <br /><br />Cashing Out refers to turning your bitcoins into &quot;cold hard cash&quot; which is not an issue until you try to buy something IRL with cash worth more than $10000...this is when the IRS will step in and you&#039;d better hope that your money has been laundered. <br /><br />Laundering is the process of turning illegally gotten funds into seemingly legal funds. In order to do this one must report the laundered funds as income and pay taxes on it. You can either launder the cash once you&#039;ve cashed using various classical methods to do so or you can claim your income in bitcoins therefore making your bitcoins appear as legal income.

				sorry to hi jack this thread, but if you were cashing out. would this be sufficient:<br /><br />&nbsp;SR single transactions to different bitcoin addresses, then they all go in different amounts to what was originally sent to bitcoinfog, from there they can go into an offline wallet and sold via localbitcoins as cash?<br /><br />would this be sufficient to avoid tracing them back to you? and also this is neccesary for say 2-4k a week in bitcoins?<br /><br />finally how could you then go about putting that cash into your real account without it raising questions?<br /><br />again sorry to hijack but hopefully its along the same lines as the original question<br /><br />thanks for anyone who answers it.

				This is my first post and I felt compelled to dispel some of the myths relating to money laundering. <br /><br />Money laundering itself is a broad term- legally, it means taking money from any illegal activity. In 2008 the Supreme Court clarified this to mean profits from an illegal activity. However the term is still extremely broad and can be applied to pretty much anything a prosecutor would like. For example, say you owe me $100. You tell me your going to sell some pot and give me the money to pay me back. A creative prosecutor would say that this is money laundering because you took the proceeds and profited off an illegal activity. <br /><br />Now with that said, you could create a corporation and pay your taxes. But guess what.....you have to PROVE where that money came from. Sure you can say your a consultant, you can set up a fake website, etc etc. None of that is real and LE is not stupid especially when they want to confiscate your money. I promise you, from experience, this will not work. The IRS will also re-estimate your tax returns and come after you. <br /><br />Ensuring the safety of your money is a fulltime job if you want to do it right.

Creating a corp and filing taxes is not enough. To truly legitimize your income you have to show where it comes from and who your customers are. You actually really need a legit business to do so. LE will first confiscate your money before anything else. Then they will ask you what part you earned legally and which part you didn&#039;t. You have to prove to them what part is legal by having employees, a tangible product, etc etc. You don&#039;t have to launder money if you are smart enough to hide your money so well that they can&#039;t find it.
