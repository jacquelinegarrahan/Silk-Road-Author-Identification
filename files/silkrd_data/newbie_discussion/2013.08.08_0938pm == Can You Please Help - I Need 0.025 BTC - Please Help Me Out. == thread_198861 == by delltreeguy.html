				I am desperately trying to place an order and I am 0.025 BitCoins short. Is there anyone out there that would be willing to help me out. Basically I&#039;m like $2-$3 dollars short. It&#039;s a real pain, and I cannot get to purchasing BitCoins for another couple days. I&#039;m trying to purchase some Suboxone so I can fight my withdraw symptoms. I am attempting to quit using Opiates. If anyone out there is willing to help me out by sending me a few bucks I would be seriously grate full. I really really would. Thank you for reading this and considering it. My BitCoin address is below. All donations would be a Godsend right now.<br /><br />1HJjPYBbiLHY1rjdZBRyBCz2fhmYgKdctk

				What a coincidence, I also had a BTC shortage of 0.025 earlier today. Was gonna buy 5x 210mcg lsd blotters, but now it became 3x 210mcg lsd blotters and 2x 220mg mdma ecstasy pills.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to try candyflipping.

				Yes, you are correct. I am aware you can buy 0.1 BitCoins online. I would if I had any amount of money. I do not have a bank account. Bit Instant is down. Last time I bought BitCoins I had to use localbitcoins.com and had to meet with someone in person. I also have no mode of transportation to go anywhere unless I get a ride. I also have to place the order today or else I have to wait two more days in withdraw.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to beg for anything. I hardly think asking for two or three bucks is swindling someone. I would understand if I was asking for like 50 bucks or something. We&#039;re talking about 3 dollars. I don&#039;t want to be flamed or harassed by anyone either. I would rather go through withdraw than listen to a bunch of inconsiderate people that have nothing to do but post sly remarks. Bottom line is I can&#039;t purchase any BitCoins or have any way to really help myself; therefore, I am forced to ask for help. If you&#039;re not going to be help full or have anything constructive to say, then please keep your comments to yourself. If someone donates then I will post on here that the 0.025 coins were received so no one else needlessly wastes their money. I don&#039;t think I am being unfair or attempting to pull a con job on anyone. I&#039;m being as honest as possible. Thank you all. Take care.

				Thank you &quot;jescowhite&quot; for your donation. You really have helped me out. Your donation was safely received. Again, thank you so much for your generosity. I guess there is hope for humanity after all.

				Thank you *jescotwhite* for your help. I was writing you a message when you already replied. delltreeguy is actually my account. I made it a long time ago and never used it. To my surprise I logged in and was able to remember the password and pin to it and had the coins moved to my corvair account. It&#039;s kind of funny really, lol. I wasn&#039;t expecting you to send them to delltreeguy but that was honestly my fault for not putting my username and putting the BTC address instead. I should have paid better attention. Anyway I am an honest person and like I said in my post I am not looking to scam anyone or just beg for free stuff. If you send me your username I will send you 0.025 BTC back to you if you wish. It&#039;s no problem at all. Again, I really appreciate your help and your consideration. You really did help me out. Thanks man.

				Thank you for letting me know. I am a n00b to the forum and I haven&#039;t completely looked around. I have skimmed through it though. The main reason why I posted here is because I thought that n00bs have to post 50 before they can post anywhere else.&nbsp; I will keep this in mind if I ever have the problem again. Someone has helped me I would like to return the favor to some other people once I re-stock on BTC. Again, thanks for the advice.
