				What do you think?<br /><br />Some people carry pepper spray, others switchblades, but I was wondering about effectiveness of poisons. It would still require getting very close to the other person and a lot of precision with injection. Another thing is the time for the poison to start working. How about carrying some strong acid in a proper container?<br /><br />What are your thoughts? And what would you do to make this idea less stupid and ineffective? ;)

				I think carrying poisons or toxins in a injectable anything is somewhat illegal. idk though, blades themselves are illegal after a certain length.. 6&quot; i believe and full auto blades are illegal in most states unless you carry a military/police license or something like that. dont quote me, stoned lol

				In my work I deal with needles and syringes daily, and I still accidently stick myself regularly.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be a goner if I was carrying around a loaded poisen syringe! :)&nbsp; Also, I doubt it would be easy to work the plunger in the heat of battle.<br /><br />

				OTOH, a big ass syringe with a long, thick needle would be one hell of a deterrent.&nbsp; I would be creeped the fuck out if someone whipped one out on me!

				So it&#039;s a great way to scare someone off for sure, but pretty useless in a fight.<br /><br />There&#039;s always poison darts or little arrows and a blow pipe just like amazonian tribes use. I think it could work with ricin or strychnine ;)

				I think your main problem will be actually injecting the poison in what ever manner unless its something like pepper spray/mace style delivery. That is the only way I can imagine that would be quick enough although there can be a lot of &quot;splash damage&quot;. I carry an ASP baton (illegal in my country) with me most nights as I can conceal it easily, I prefer this over edged weapons and firearms (mega illegal, much rather get caught with an ASP). I have only had to use it once in self defense when I was jumped by a bunch a group of Africans. They ended up running so fast I didn&#039;t even get a good swing in, just one into one of their legs.

				Whether you can actually inject it or not, it is one hell of a deterrent and will keep people away from you.&nbsp; And that is the goal anyhow, right?

				next to useless. unless you could be sure to hit into a vein it would take ages to start affecting him.<br /><br />pro tip: you couldn&#039;t be sure to hit a vein.
