				I had 25i-nbome last weekend. (1.2mg) and I was really looking forward to trying again this weekend, and but I&#039;ve been reading weird tolerance times... (some up to a week) so I would really like a fellow SR citizen to help me out. What is the natural time for 25i-nbome to die off? I want a full trip.. dunn wanna waste ;) Also.. I for anyone out there interested... what is your take on 25c-NBOME as compared to 25i? and.... A trip report on a hash/opium blend maybe?&nbsp; thanks

				I&#039;m in exactly the same situation. Would really like to know how 25c-nbome compares.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard up to 2 weeks is best to wait between trips. Definitely worth checking out as much as possible on erowid.org<br /><br />Can&#039;t help as far as opiates are concerned but in my experience with magic mushrooms the longer you leave it the better (2-4weeks at least was my standard) and I&#039;m convinced THC reduces the effects of the psychedelic trip I got from shrooms. It would be something I saved for just before I wanted to get some rest. Of course, if you&#039;re the type prone to paranoia or anxiety after a toke it&#039;s probably best avoided completely with psychedelics. <br /><br />Interested to see what anyone more experienced in nbomes has to add for sure

				I&#039;ve dosed 25i more than twenty times now. You should wait a week between trips at the very minimum, but two weeks will grant you much better results. Be careful redosing day after day; I went on a little bender and had a psychotic reaction that really fucked my life plan up. Needless to say, I use 25i much more sparingly now. I&#039;ve got a batch of 25c on the way right now, so I&#039;ll shoot out an update comparing the two once I have the chance to try it out.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read about the two, general consensus says 25c is more earthy, while 25i has a more digital ring to it (which I totally agree with). I&#039;m actually really fed up with how robotic 25i makes me feel, so I&#039;m crossing my fingers that the C will give me a better experience.

				Just my opinion but weekly is way too much and not enough time anyway.&nbsp; Save your money and use LSD a few times/year.

				I heard that 25-i-nbome tolerence in very similar to lsd tolerance and it will have cross tolerance with like all other psychedelics. i say the next day the tolerance would be 200% meaning you&#039;d need two times the dose to get similar effects, 125% tolerence by 7 days and make to 100% tolerence (no tolerence) at 14 days

				Def wait a couple weeks before dosing again. I&#039;ve had multiple people bitch at me saying they were bunk because they tried to redose early, and personally I&#039;ve had the same problem with insuffulating the powder days in between and didn&#039;t trip at all. Two weeks minimum I would say

				possibly stupid question... but I have got my hands on some 25c-NBOMe and while I took 25i 2 weekends ago... I was wondering if the tolerance would carry over seeing as they are still part of the NBOMe family... I wouldn&#039;t wanna waste a 25c just be a useful of a stupid tolerance. I thanks:)
