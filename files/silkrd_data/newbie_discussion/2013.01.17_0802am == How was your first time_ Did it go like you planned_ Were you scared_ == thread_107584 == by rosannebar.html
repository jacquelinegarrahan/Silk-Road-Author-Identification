				Yea the bitinstant seems like the best way to go of all the methods out there. Most anonymous for people in the us. <br /><br />The other exchanges have to collect personal information about you not to mention link to a bank account.<br /><br />It is the way I would go.

				When i found out about sr i was fuckin overwhelmed. I revised it was legit right away and was super excited to order. Went to the post office and got a box the next day. Then i ordered Oz of hash of tweetbe, an oz of mushrooms from rocker, and a g of molly from eazyjet. After 10 days none of them had arrived and i was fuckin Pissed! I thought i was fucked and i had gotten busted. Turns out the post office hadnt processed that i opened to the box and thought it was unnocupied. I got the tracking from the vendors and it had been returned to sender. tweetbe is such a good guy he reshipped the package!!! The hash was amazing. never got the shrooms tho :(<br />

				bitcointalks, is one of the scam/spam sites, no one is going to sell you BTC, 3$ cheaper per, they would be out of business fast...<br /><br />if you want to go that route, use coinbase.com you get a wallet, an acct you can link to your bank, then just tumble to instawallet or something and go... the only drawback...it takes 3-4 days I think to get a complete transaction?

				PGP is simple but for some reason I was having a brain-block about it until it became important - for SR :)<br /><br />I bought some low-priority/unscheduled prescription pills since it was the amount of legal risk I&#039;ve taken in the past.<br />Was much, much better and easier than stupid grey-market apothecaries.

				I don&#039;t like having to go through the whole 50 posts thing now; however, I encourage you to make a liveusb using Liberte Linux. It is absolutely easy, don&#039;t be scared away by things just because they may sound complicated. It&#039;s the reason most people don&#039;t PGP encrypt, they think it sounds hard or will be a burden to learn, while in reality it is only 5 extreeeeeeeeemely easy steps and that 7 year olds&nbsp; be taught how to do it in 10 minutes.

				I am still waiting for my first order to come. Not too worried because the vender has good reviews. As soon as I found SR I was extremely interested. It turns out all the research I have read on many psychoactive compounds, including RCs, can be acquired here. Looking forward to new experiences! Lucky, all the research and personal use of compounds helped me find a good deal.

				I studied a lot and read the FAQs. First time, I acquired bitcoins on a common website, then sent them to online wallets and then to SR. Once I had that, I read ratings and the forum to find a reputable vendor not requiring FE and selling meds for which i&#039;ve had prescriptions (limiting risk). I ordered a quantity clearly intended for personal consumption and I waited. <br /><br />I actually got scared after doing it, during the waiting period.<br /><br />Package arrived, no SWAT team came to ass rape me. Second scare was when swallowing two of the pills because, well, you never know. But product was good. I did not die. I searched for other vendors, kept ordering &quot;legal&quot; meds (even if controlled). I still have to order something really illegal (ie street drugs). <br /><br />I&#039;ve also read the legal parts of the forum a lot, watched a bunch of documentaries, and realized that the risk for the low quantity buyer to get shit delivered is close to nil. In most countries, it seems the police won&#039;t even lift an eyelid for 2 grams of coke in an enveloppe. <br /><br />I&#039;m starting to see SR as any other online vending site. ebay type. Sure beats buying anything from Little Chaz on a street corner.

It&#039;s extremely simple. All you do is download tails .iso and usb installer and choose tails on the installation screen. Then it installs and all you have to do is choose boot from usb on start up screen :) The browsers are already using tor and PGP is included.....AND it&#039;s safer by a lot, especially if you are using windows or mac. If that is too much trouble, even though it took me about half an hour, then at least run your tor and pgp off a usb! You never know what may happen, and if shit ever goes down hill (hopefully not) you can just throw that shit down your toilet and your clean as a whistle!
