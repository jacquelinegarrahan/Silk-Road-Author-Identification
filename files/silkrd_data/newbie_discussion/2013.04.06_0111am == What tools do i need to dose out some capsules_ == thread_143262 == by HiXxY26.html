				I&#039;m going to be dosing out some capsules and was wondering what the best tools are to make my life easier.<br />Whats a good scale to buy? Is one of those cheap ones off ebay ok or is there a better option?<br />This is mainly going to be for MDMA and different RCs and is just for personal use not distributing.<br />thanks for any tips&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;ve got two, both of which I ordered from overseas because I&#039;m &quot;extremely cautious,&quot; and heard once upon a time that eBay and Amazon have interfaces for law enforcement to perform searches for things like digital milligram scales.&nbsp; And let&#039;s be honest, who except dealers and jewelers really even has a use for digital scales -- and the jewelers are going to invest in a high quality one.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to order them just fine though, so it&#039;s probably fine.&nbsp; My milligram one is accurate to within 3-5mg and was about $20 (advertised as 0.001 precision).&nbsp; Works like a charm and has for a couple months now.&nbsp; The other one is accurate to within 15-20mg (0.01 precision); that one was about $30.&nbsp; Honestly for the prices I expected them to be junk and fall apart after a week, particularly the cheaper more sensitive one.&nbsp; Not so at all -- they&#039;re worth at least twice what I paid, and Amazon had what looked like the same scales for sale at the time.&nbsp; Presumably they&#039;ll also do well for you.<br /><br />I&#039;d give you models and stuff, but... there is no model, lol.&nbsp; Just generic digital scales that say &quot;mini digital scale&quot; and nothing else.&nbsp; So anyway, long story short: you&#039;d be surprised how well some of the super cheap ones work.&nbsp; Take a chance on one.

				There are all kinds of good scales on the market. The scale is really not the difficult part of the encapsulation process. Making capsules is a very frustrating and time consuming process. There are different types of encapsulation machines on the market. They all look simple in the videos, but in reality it takes a long time to get good at it. Having a good work station table is essential. Just take your time and don&#039;t get frustrated. The more you do, the easier it will get.

				Check out the http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365239143&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mg+scale&nbsp; this is a great scale that nootropics, RC, and supplement enthusiasts recommend.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using it for several months and it&#039;s great.&nbsp; Also the $6 scale from ebay is great for things that don&#039;t require the accuracy. Cap-m-quik and the capsule machine are two of the common machines to help hold your empty caps while you make them. I use 2 glossy business cards have have been folded in half lengthwise to help as scoops/funnels while I&#039;m making caps.&nbsp; It can be time consuming.&nbsp; I&#039; averaging about 50 caps an hour.
