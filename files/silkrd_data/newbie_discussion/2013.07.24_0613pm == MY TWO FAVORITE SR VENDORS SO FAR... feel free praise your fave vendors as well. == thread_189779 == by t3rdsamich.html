				I just wanna put it out there that I have talked with quite a few vendors in my search for suboxone/ subutex and before that I purchased some other product from a vendor named DOPATONIN. He was the first person I ever talked to on SR and man was I pleased. He is super nice, responsive, helpful and when it comes to the product its out of this world. It arrived the day after it was shipped. Was triple sealed and came with a bonus dvd. I highly highly recommend Dopatonin if he sells what your looking for. You wont be disappointed. <br /><br /><br />The other vendor I would like to give a hats off to is ONE EYED WILLIE. Now he only sells subutex and I believe he is out of that right now as well but he was extremely helpful. I had recently been ripped off by another vendor trying to get some suboxone. Not only did he pay the extra shipping but he threw in an extra 8mg subutex for me to be paid for later. It was a loan but a much needed one as running out of subutex during a detox wouldnt be ideal. Definitely definitely check out both of these vendors. You wont be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks to both of you guys, its vendors like you guys that make SR pleasant and possible.

				Not to hijack this guys thread or anything, but i&#039;ll throw in a plug for seneca if you&#039;re in the market for subs.&nbsp; he&#039;s super legit, gets items in the mail super quick.&nbsp; his first class mail arrives as fast as priority every time, clear across the country.&nbsp; very professional.

				no worries gator i actually intended for people to put their fave vendors as well. ill modify the title. i also just really wanted those vendors to have their name out there in a positive way. everyone takes the time to bitch about not just vendors but anything and so many times when a good deed is done it goes unnoticed and i just didnt wanna be that guy. i like to try to give as much good feedback as i can.&nbsp; where does that sub vendor live? US? Im in Canada.
