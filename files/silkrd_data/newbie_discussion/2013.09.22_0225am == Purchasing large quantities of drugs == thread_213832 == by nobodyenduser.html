				I have seen listings for ounces or more of meth which costs thousands of dollars. Are they serious? I couldn&#039;t ever imagine spending thousands of dollars at once. Certainly you are not going to FE and the vendor will probably want FE.<br /><br />Is it all bullshit? And how are you going to ship a quarter pound of meth or pot. Inside a the motor compartment of a refrigerator lol!<br /><br />It seems utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyhoo I&#039;m just trying to get my post count up and by not doing the asshole way by posting garbage in the spam thread.

				Lol, yeah I couldn&#039;t fathom shipping assload amount of drugs at one time. I think that best route to go is to order smaller amounts from different people at once. It draws much less attention and more difficult to trace when you have multiple packages arriving from different sources rather than one huge or multiple package from one source. Anywho, It would make me cringe too much to drop a grad or much on a single purchase. Too risky and I wouldn&#039;t be &#039;able to sleep thinking about it. Oh well, I guess people do it with no hesitation since they&#039;re offered.

				Thing is... if a vendor builds up a reputation and can ship thousands of dollars a day, why wouldn&#039;t zhe?<br /><br />And if you have a drop address with someone you trust, and you can ship drugs there, AND you can sell them?&nbsp; It&#039;s a cheap way to get started as a dealer.

				People buy kilos on here all the time. A kilo isnt even that big of a package it fits in a standard priority mail box. Its not suspicious what so ever and as long as its domestic unless someone snitches on you the chances of you getting caught are extremely small.

				As a Vendor, If your constantly dealing with International Customer&#039;s, It&#039;s a much larger risk trying to ship a large quantity. Trying to create a legit stealthy way of&nbsp; getting it pass customs problem free isn&#039;t so simple, SR is anonymous so no telling at some point who&#039;s a scamming piece of crap.

				Don&#039;t worry fellas, vendors know what they are doing, and besides they are not that stupid to just send an item that might get caught, it can end up costing them 50% value of it also. <br /><br /><br /><br />Meerkovo
