				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8962.0 &lt;&lt;--- guide to PGP!!!<br /><br />A basic explanation, when you create a PGP message, there are 2 sets of 2 keys. A public and private key for the encryption end, and a public and private key for the decryption end.<br />Each user has a private key, and only that private key can decrypt a message that has been encrpyted to that private key&#039;s respective public key, and vice versa. <br /><br />You ALWAYS want to keep your private key private(duh) and your PUBLIC key is the key you give to other PGP users, to encrypt messages to you.<br /><br />For those of you who have PGP Desktop, it&#039;s as simple as: <br /><br />Selecting the entire PGP Message Text from a vendors Public Key, Ctrl+C(Copy), go to PGP tray, Clipboard, Decrypt &amp; Verify: Import their key/email info.<br /><br />Write a message. When finished, select your message text, Ctrl+C(copy), go to PGP tray, clipboard, Encrypt: then select the email/key you imported. <br /><br /><br /><br />--I have experience as both a buyer and seller, if you want vending tips you can PM me. :P<br /><br />Buying tips I can openly discuss here.&nbsp; :D

I won&#039;t argue; I won&#039;t make up things about things that I think I thought I heard somewhere here or there on the internet, or amongst my social circles. <br /><br />No. All I will do is freely inform those who wish to be informed, and keep myself out of those flame-threads that seem to be a dime-a-dozen these days.

MDMA that comes from MDPV a lot of times has impurities in it that need to be washed away. As stated, a lot of &quot;bath salt&quot; derivatives come directly from MDPV, so if the synthesis isn&#039;t impeccable(and even if it is) it&#039;s very hard to yield the maximum purity of MDMA. For instance, if you ran a Mass-spectrometry on the grey-white MDMA that comes from MDPV, you will find that it&#039;s usually 82-83% MDMA, 16% Hydrochloride, and 1-2% &quot;other&quot; MDxx salt(s). It typically yields a Grey-white &quot;moonrock&quot; <br /><br />Of course, versus Shulgin&#039;s method II, MDMA from PMK yields the maximum purity under the proper conditions, of 84% MDMA by mass. However, Shulgin&#039;s method I is what everyone knows and &#039;loves&#039; as &quot;brown sand&quot; MDMA, and also contains a lot of impurities. Usually needs to be washed, producing white-purple &quot;moon rocks&quot;, sometimes pure. <br /><br />It is my understanding that the only way of yielding pure MDMA Hcl with no other impurities is through PMK. Of course, anyone is welcome to correct me if I&#039;m wrong! This is just what I&#039;ve been told by a chemical engineer who used to make the stuff. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171187.msg1225924#msg1225924">Quote from: madhat on June 12, 2013, 03:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Great thread idea. <br />Any suggestions for good anon drop offs?
