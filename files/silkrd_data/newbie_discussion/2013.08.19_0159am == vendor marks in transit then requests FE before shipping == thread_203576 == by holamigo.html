				This can&#039;t be right. Shouldn&#039;t he say &quot;I&#039;m going to need FE&quot; before we get this far?<br />Now if he just ignores my reply, where I assured him I am trustworthy, but that I do not want to FE, well then I&#039;ll have to wait 10 days to get my $300 back won&#039;t I?<br /><br />I spent $585 in the last few weeks with 4 other vendors, no problems. Member for 10 months.

				I&#039;m a newb myself, but I&#039;ve already learned that you should NEVER finalize early. It&#039;s an invitation to be scammed.

				Exactly, although this seller does have exemplary feedback. There isn&#039;t much on the forums about him, but again, what there is seems to be all positive.

				It&#039;s just that, clearly the product is not &quot;in transit&quot; at all.<br /><br />Is there not a requirement for sellers to change state to &quot;in transit&quot; when that is actually true?

				Sounds fishy. If they require FE then it should say so clearly on the listing page.

				I just hope he reads my message/reply and either cancels the transaction or agrees to just send it.<br />Either way, he has told the SR system that it&#039;s &quot;in transit&quot; when it&#039;s not. So if I do nothing, it will auto finalize in 17 days, and if he gives me my money back, won&#039;t that show in my stats as a refund, even though he never sent anything?<br /><br />He should have msgd me before marking in transit.

				It&#039;s absolutely wrong if you or somebody else will FE. It means, that more and more new buyers will get problems, connected with purchasing on SR. Give him 1/5 if you will be scammed. <br />

I don&#039;t want to name him because I don&#039;t want to upset him. If he chooses not to read my reply to him though and leave me and my money in limbo for days and days then I&#039;ll say who it is and ask SR staff how I go about cancelling a deal that&#039;s &quot;in transit&quot; but clearly *not* in transit.

Don&#039;t hope on his reading or something more. i think now also about my item, which is &quot;in transit&quot; but &quot;not arrived&quot;, and for 2 weeks on SR i see, that a sender really has a way does not sending of any item, but marking it as &quot;in transit&quot;.

				I need not have worried.<br /><br />I FE&#039;d, and the product arrived within 2 days from an international destination.<br /><br />There is a reason why HappyTimezz is ranked in the top 3% of all sellers.<br /><br />I still think he should have informed me of the FE requirement before marking &quot;in transit&quot;, although the FE requirement for low-feedback users is on his vendor profile. IMO &quot;in transit&quot; should mean exactly that, and until a product is marked as &quot;in transit&quot;, it should be seen as just an offer to purchase. I just thought that my 10 month term, combined with few, but relatively high value purchases, would have stood me in good stead. His vendor profile says &quot;New members who are less than 1 month active and/or with less than 10 transaction will be asked to FE&quot;. It is ambiguous and shouldn&#039;t say and/or, it should just say &quot;or&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, good result from a good vendor. I have now purchased a load of crap (16/1 lotteries that I didn&#039;t win 3 times, &quot;advice from a soon-to-be-psychologist&quot;, and a few diazepams), and now have more than 10 transactions on my feedback :D lol
