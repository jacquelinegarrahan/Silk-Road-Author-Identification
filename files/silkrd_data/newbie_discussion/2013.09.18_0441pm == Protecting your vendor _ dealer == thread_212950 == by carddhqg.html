				A big part of their job is to protect themselves and experienced vendors are pretty good at it.<br /><br />That said, the main thing you can do do is not to reveal any specific details of their packaging. Sometimes when people write reviews in feedback or in the forums they reveal stuff like the size, colour, type of envelope, vacuum method etc. I doubt that this would ever help anyone find what the dealers post but some people can get offended by it and it&#039;s good to stay on the vendor&#039;s good side if you can help it.

				One thing that everyone needs to do to protect their vendor is finalize immediately upon receipt of your order.&nbsp; You can leave a review later.

				Dispose of packaging quickly and safely. Don&#039;t leave these materials lying around for days on your dresser or in your bedroom wastebasket or outside trash can. Casually drop them in the trash the next time you&#039;re at the gas station or a fast food restaurant. Also, don&#039;t yak to all your friends (in person or online) about what you&#039;re doing on SR.

				Don&#039;t mention how the packaging looks like, destroy the packaging as soon as possible and dispose it. Also keep your mouth shut about where you got your stuff from, I know it&#039;s tempting to tell your friends about the magical road but it might be better if they figured it out themselves.

				The way I see it dealer don&#039;t really need much &#039;protection&#039; I mean all they have to do is buy envelopes and drop them off at various post offices. Their main concerns should be ensuring online anonyminity + clean cash flow.&nbsp; And if LE are really serious about investigating SR, then surely they have ordered from all the main suppliers and scoped out their stealth anyway.

				Make sure you vendor packages your product properly.&nbsp; That can make a world of difference.
