				Hello All, I&#039;m a new vendor on SR. I&#039;ve been a cannabis grower for about 7 years and am happy to offer my products here, I always make an effort to never spray my plants with anything, I think it makes a difference to the end user.<br /><br />So right now I&#039;m offering smaller amounts, just to see how this will go,&nbsp; soon to offering larger amounts. <br />Tonight I&#039;m going to post a sampler listing of some bubbleberry that I think most will really enjoy. <br />The smell is addicting, everyone that has tried it has come back for more......locally I mean, so I hope to have a similar response here <br />on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />All shipping will be double vacuum sealed with a sealed interior to avoid any leakage of smell. <br />I&#039;ve been shipping out of state for awhile with friends and haven&#039;t had any issues so I&#039;m positive all will go well on that end.<br /><br />Please send feedback if on my vendor page I&#039;ve missed any information. thanks!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3b5cbeb24a

				Everyone that knows anything about marijuana knows that the best stuff comes out of the Emerald triangle.&nbsp; If this vendor is from Humbolt county or Mendo it should be quality stuff.&nbsp; Northern California is where it&#039;s at!!!!!

				Communication 5/5<br />I received a confirmation message on shipment, as well as a date on when to expect it. <br /><br />Shipping 5/5<br />Fastest shipping I have ever experienced. Ordered Wednesday night, received Friday. <br /><br />Product 5/5<br />Holy shit, LOUD weed! I had it in my pocket and everyone i walked by could smell it. Very solid product, weighed over plus a free fat joint!<br /><br />Stealth 5/5<br />Nice stealth for domestic shipping<br /><br />Overall great experience. Would like to try more of NCC&#039;s buds!<br />

				Hey man, just wanted to let you know that you should add the 5 dashes before the &quot;BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK&quot; for your key on your vendor page. I wasn&#039;t able to import it as it is. I added them manually and it worked fine. I sent you a pm on SR

				Posted this on the main review thread but posting here also.<br /><br /><br />All I can say is wow. It&#039;s been a year since I&#039;ve had Cali buds. Mmmm how I&#039;ve missed them. The hydro I&#039;ve been getting off the street where I&#039;m at sucks from quality to price.<br /><br />I loved my order from NorCalChronic. I may sample other sellers on here from time to time.....but NCC will be my main guy/girl as long as they, SR and I are around.<br /><br />This Review is for the Purple Blueberry. I&#039;ve got some AK-47 coming and I&#039;ll be sure and leave a review on the quality of it when it arrives. <br /><br />Price *&nbsp; I think the prices are great for what you get. I haven&#039;t weighed because my scale broke. I picked up another scale today and will be weighing my current purchase when I receive just to see. Just from looking at the blueberry when I got it, it appeared overweight. Even if NCC is spot on weight, its still a good deal for the price.<br /><br />Shipping * Its free. Its fast. His stealth is the best I&#039;ve seen so far compared to any item I&#039;ve gotten from SR. I mostly bought from top vendors, and his stealth has surpassed them all. I&#039;m not gonna say much about it to protect his practices but I will say I did not smell anything when I got the package. Buds stayed fluffy. You can purchase with total confidence that your order will arrive.<br /><br />Communication * Is great. I&#039;m sure NCC is busy, but totally nice enough to let me know my order shipped, and quick with response to any questions.<br /><br />Quality * The Blueberry smells so good. I could smell that all day long and be in heaven. Definitely a dank smell. Like some others have said its covered in crystals and trichomes. I tip my beanie to the trimmers, they did a good a job. This buds not super dense, its more on the fluffy side but I actually prefer that, and seller lets you know which of his strains are popcorn / or dense in the listing. Over-all two hits is all it takes me with this and I&#039;ve got a chill high going. NCC also included a free pre-roll. It was nicely rolled, the sugar trim was good and three of us enjoyed it.<br /><br />Love the Blueberry. Love NorCalChronic. Thanks again man.<br />
