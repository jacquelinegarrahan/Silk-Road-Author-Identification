				Ordered cannabis from this domestic vendor. Supposedly sends by express post (next day delivery). Marked as in-transit. Did not arrive that day or the next. Now I&nbsp; receive a msg saying the order has been cancelled and bc refunded. <br /><br />Clearly the &quot;in transit&quot; was a lie so I am thinking a &quot;1&quot; is appropriate. Thoughts?

				There are various reasons for a cancel but a bit sus if in tranzit has been marked? <br /><br />Qualityausurance sent me an order and I gave 5/5 feedback before weighing. doh.<br /><br />It was over 14g but very very damp and appeared to be about 7gm. I left it to dry for a day and it then weighed 11g. <br />I asked the vendor about this and he said a free 3.5 on my next order. Cool! I said thanks but that&#039;s months away what else can ya do.<br /><br />No responce at all and he hasn&#039;t listed since then either.... Was I really the only one to get a 25% smaller product out of his 50 odd sales?

				Hey guys,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We had a break due to an issue that concerns no one else. We will hold up to our end of every bit of business we have stated. Sorry to cancel the order it was best for both of us. While on break we have fixed all loose ends and once our bud listings are up it will be smooth sailing. We will be sending that 3.5g as stated and had maybe one other complaint who appeared to be another vendor saying our stuff was moldy etc..QAUS is trading Ketamine(wont be beaten on quality or price) and soon will be listing cannabis and MDMA.<br /><br />Thanks for being understanding if you left a 1 for cancelling an order and refunding in full well unfortunately you would&#039;ve joined our non-order list.<br /><br />Regards QAUS :)
