				Yo waddup. I&#039;m new to the forums and I was wondering if you guys could offer me some tips. Basically here&#039;s the scoop.<br /><br />I am CONSTANTLY asked where to find MDMA. It&#039;s so rare around here that it can be sold anywhere between 80 - 120$ dollars a gram. I never knew where to find it because drugs were never actually my thing but I had tried it about 2-3 times before and it was very disappointing each time.<br /><br />Last weekend a buddy of mine told me he can get the best stuff around for dirt cheap, and said he&#039;d even let me try it for free so I said why the fuck not. He passes me a little bag and the shit looks nothing like what I had before, it just looks like chunks of dirt. I was skeptical as fuck but whatever. I chopped it up, weighed out .2 (which is less than i usually do because the other stuff was so cut it took .5 or so to even feel it slightly) and holy fucking jesus I was thwacked out of my god damn mind. <br /><br />Basically, he said I can get an ounce at 60 bucks a g. and I know that I could have that entire O out of my hands in less than a week selling it at 80. I could even cut it and make even more money of it that way. My question being is that I&#039;ve never sold jack shit before and need to know the do-s and dont-s. <br /><br />How do I go about communication? Texting? facebook? Using a burner? <br /><br />How should I go about transport? throw small amounts in my bag and make little stops to everybody? or have them all come to me? <br /><br />Cutting.. I assume the ol Vitamin B12 would work.. but how much should I add to an O? one gram? two grams? every bit adds more money to my pocket.<br /><br /><br />I have a full time job, and Id just be doing this once or twice a month on the side for some extra dough. Thoughts? <br /><br />thanks yall<br />

				cutting any gear is an arsehole thing to do. keep it clean and up the price - most customers would appreciate it more and keep coming back - you cut it and don&#039;t mix it properly there&#039;s a chance some poor sod will get a bag mostly full of the cut. there goes your reputation.<br /><br />and TBH mate if you have to ask about how to deal IRL you&#039;ll be easy pickings for the gendarmes. i wouldn&#039;t bother if i were you

				Yes, dealing is stressful enough even for people who do know what they&#039;re doing. However...<br /><br />Firstly, observe how your own dealers operate. If you don&#039;t have enough experience of buying from other dealers, what are you thinking?<br /><br />Secondly, don&#039;t sell anything that you wouldn&#039;t use yourself. Ideally, test every batch, in the form that you&#039;re going to sell it, personally. If you don&#039;t have enough experience of what you&#039;re selling to tell what&#039;s good product and what isn&#039;t, what the hell are you thinking?<br /><br />Thirdly, if your only motive it to make money with no regard to quality or the effect on your customers... you&#039;re not worth thinking about.<br />

				Fuck cutting - just sell the good shit at a higher price.<br /><br />Buy as much as you can - and store it in a secure place ie not at your fucking house.<br /><br />Sell 1gm as a time and don&#039;t give it the big &quot;I am&quot; about being a dealer, only sell to close/trusted friends, don&#039;t tell anybody how much you have.<br /><br />Also better to make out that you&#039;re not making profit off it, say &quot; a bloke I know at work reckons he can get good stuff&quot; etc. stops people hassling you for &quot;mates rates&quot; all the time.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Bottom line make sure you&#039;re never carrying more than a gm for &quot;personal use&quot;
