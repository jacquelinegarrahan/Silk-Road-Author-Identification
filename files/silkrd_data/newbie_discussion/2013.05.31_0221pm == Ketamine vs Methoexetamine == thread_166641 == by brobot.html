				So, being new to SR has opened the door to new things. One being methoexetamine. I have researched it and it is said that it lasts longer than Ketamine and is stronger. My question is, Has anyone tried the methoex? What is the difference? Can I pass it off as K? Also, what are the street prices of K in your city? It&#039;s crazy here. I live in a medium sized city to and K is 100.00 US a gram!!

				Baah that&#039;s absurd. 10GBP/g here in the UK really, not looking at anything more than that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had MXE and ketamine both on several occasions and I&#039;ve always much preferred the MXE. It&#039;s been a far more wild trip, absolutely K-holed instead of just mildly ruined that I get with ~250mg of ket.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go passing one thing of for something it&#039;s not, that&#039;s what cunts do. Don&#039;t be a cunt!

				I don&#039;t wanna pass it off as being one thing, but the name is really bad &quot;methoextamine&quot; because of the word meth lol which is largely frowned upon here. Is there a nickname for mxe? Another question. If you gave someone MXE and they didnt know it, would they think/know it wasn&#039;t Ketamine? Pricing wise it seems MXE is poor mans K? <br /><br />Another thing people are doing here is calling moonrocks Molly which it isn&#039;t. I&#039;m going to make another post on how I got here because it relates to this.

				people I have spoke to call it mexy. And im told you can tell the difference because MXE has more of a stimulant side as well but this is only what i have heard but have not tried it to confirm!<br /><br />and moon rocks is the same thing as molly!! it all MDMA just moon rocks is what you call large crystals!!

				I have experience with both and I have to say I like MXE much more than K. The reason is, K is kind of puts me in a depressed state and the effects and more hardcore, while MXE is a lot of fun and I am all giggly and stuff. The base of the effects is essentially the same, but these small details make it a completely different experience. Also, MXE lasts longer and definitely stimulates me. Once, I had a lone binge during the night and it was crazy! Being alone in dark, super-fucked up on MXE is veery interesting. I went to bed around 5AM but couldnt sleep no matter what.
