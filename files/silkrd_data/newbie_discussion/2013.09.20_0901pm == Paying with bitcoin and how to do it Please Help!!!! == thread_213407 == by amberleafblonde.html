				I am sorry to hear about you family member, hopefully it all works out.&nbsp; As far as the process, seriously, if you dont take the time to read, study, and read some more this may not be the way to go for you.&nbsp; There is a thread not far down that actually lists some places to get BTC.&nbsp; And I have said this before, to me that is the most critical part of the equation, as those men in suits will rip you off faster than 99% of the vendors on here (funny how society would like you to believe it is the other way around).&nbsp; I think the EU has many more options for getting BTC quickly and safely than the US.&nbsp; Find that thread, and choose one from that list, should go smoothly.&nbsp; But before you do any of that please read up on how Bitcoins work, and how to move them around.&nbsp; The rest of the experience on the road should be a smooth one, just make sure you read plenty of reviews, and don&#039;t FE

				Thanks so very much for your reply.. Ive read alot about bitcoin.. I understand it to a certain degree Ive downloaded a bitcoin wallet and i have tried mining bitcoin but its been unsuccessful so far. Im not sure if ive downloaded the right sort of wallet and have no reassurance that what im doing it right as nobody i know has done this.. Ive heard of people in the country i live that have recieved stuff of silk road but only wish i knew how they did it.. I really need someone to give me some sort of guide to change euro to bitcoin.. I will search for that post you were talking about immediately thanks so much for reply and your positivity.. Much appreciated.. Peace..

				In case you did not find that list of bitcoin exchanges I pasted them here, most places will want you to wire or send cash to them, then they will credit your account so that you can exchange for bitcoins (I suppose some give bitcoins directly for cash deposit), once you have your bitcoins from their site move them to a wallet of your choice (SR wallet is fine), then you are all set, try to stick with the bigger names here until get more comfortable with the whole process:<br /><br />Many accept various forms of payment from MoneyPak, MoneyGram, Dwolla, Money Order and cash deposit to a bank.<br /><br />⚀ LocalBitCoins - (Has an escrow service) - https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />⚀ Bitcoin Brokers - www.bitcoin-brokers.org<br />⚀ CampBX (exchange/broker) - https://campbx.com/<br />⚀ BitSTamp - https://www.bitstamp.net<br />⚀ Bitcoin OTC - bitcoin-otc.com<br />⚀ CoinBase - https://coinbase.com/<br />⚀ MoneyPakTrader - https://moneypaktrader.com/<br />⚀ Virwox (exchange) - https://www.virwox.com<br />⚀ NanaimoGold - https://www.nanaimogold.com/buy.php<br />⚀ BTCQuick - https://www.btcquick.com/beta/<br />⚀ TradeYourBitcoin - http://tradeyourbitcoin.com/<br />⚀ BTCSpot - http://btcspot.com/<br />⚀ BitCoinLocator - https://www.bitcoinlocator.com/<br />⚀ TOR ATM - http://toratm3dhalotm3f.onion/<br /><br />⚀ BitQuick (has escrow service) - BitQuick.co&nbsp; -&nbsp; formerly Buy Bitcoins (https://www.buybitcoin.us)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Review Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=205594.0<br /><br />⚀ Bittylicious (UK buyers) - https://bittylicious.com/<br />⚀ BitBargain (UK Buyers) - http://www.bitbargain.co.uk<br /><br />⚀ Bitcoin.de (German buyers) - www.bitcoin.de

				The quickest and easiest method to obtain bitcoins I find is through localbitcoins. Go to the convenience store and buy a moneypak or vanilla reload card and put as much cash as you desire for exchanging with bitcions. afterwards go on the website and find an individual that accepts the aforementioned payment cards and do the exchange. It&#039;s very simple and straightforward that you should be able to figure it out with no problems. Also, very anonymous since you use cash for the reload cards. I hope this helps out my friend and will pray for your ill family member. Take care.

				Localbitcoin is the way to go.&nbsp; Me in person to transfer the coins or make a cash deposit anonymously into a nearby bank. Bingo!

But i guess you pay for quickness. Sites like coinbase take up to a week to get your bitcoins but offer cheaper exchange rates. So it comes down to how much of a hurry you are in to get your much needed coin.
