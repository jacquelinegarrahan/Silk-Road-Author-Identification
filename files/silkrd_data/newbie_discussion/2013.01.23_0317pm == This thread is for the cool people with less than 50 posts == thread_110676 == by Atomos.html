				FACT : “Jigsaw Kid” is the nickname of a six-year-old UK girl born with two left lungs, five spleens, a diseased liver, a hole in her heart, and her stomach on the wrong side. Most of her organs face front-to-back, and when her heart pumps rapidly, you can see it beating through her back. On the bright side, I’m sure she loves being called “Jigsaw Kid.” Children aren’t sensitive to that sort of thing at all.

				FACT : The pillory was a common punishment in colonial America and eighteenth century England and France. Similar to stocks, the pillory held offenders in place as onlookers pummeled themwith rocks, garbage, food, feces, dead animals, and more, sometimes to death. In 1756, four Englishmen died after just one hour in the pillory. That would be fun, actually. To throwstuff, I mean. Not to be in the pillory.

				Like a month ago. It was in response to complaints about unscupulous vendors that create a newbie screenname, in order to either praise their own shit, or to talk trash to anyone who dared to complain about them. <br /><br />Not JUST that reason.

				Yo gotta make 50 post to gain access to this cool and free minded forum, and as every journey starts with one step so does this process start with one post. besides that i wanna point out that this is slave work, but a small price to pay for the freedom it comes with. Thanks to everyone who helped make this possible, sincerely SmokeScandinavian.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				IM STILL COOL . ALMOST ABOUT TO LOSE IT LOL<br /><br />HERES SOME READING ABOUT A SCAMMER SPREAD THE WORD<br /><br />Add me to the list of people being ripped off by SamGiancana. luckily mine is just an attmept right now as I did not F/E luckily(only because I already fell for that and got ripped of twice by smooth talkers. no more) and He pulled the exact same Shtick as everyone else. first a fake usps tracking # (for a domestic order explain that one) then a message saying someone hacked his account and to resend info and he would get the real tracking # . from here he ignores every message/email and order was about to auto finalize so I put it into resoloution, just waiting on that now. <br />Man this guy is something else, so nice and sincere to begin with . and tons of people are F/E for his generous 20% extra from a &quot;trusted and stand up vendor&quot; i cant believe this<br />they really need to look at revising the rules for F/E, maybee abolish it for trusted buyers or something I dont know but the scams are getting bad.<br />
