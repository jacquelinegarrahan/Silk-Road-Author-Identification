				More stuff about SR in the wake of a few kiddies loosing their shit while tripping....<br /><br />So much that could be said in reply to any number of the false and simplistic statements made by both the writer of the article and the cop but who has the energy to ask the mongoloid to stop smiling? They will keep smiling because its all they can do and if we are honest these types of people who are the mouthpieces spreading ignorance and misinformation are one of two things; Evil.. yes EVIL. or just DUMB either way its a concern to think they run the shop...<br /><br />**CLEAR NET AHEAD** ---&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.news.com.au/national-news/nsw-act/deadly-150-lsd-tablets-trap-teens/story-fndo4bst-1226595054804<br /><br />...snip....<br /><br />Detective Superintendent Nick Bingham said young people were buying drugs online from what he describes as dark sites. &quot;For as little as $1.50 a tablet these kids are buying what they think is the hallucinogenic LSD. In fact many of them are getting 25INBOME, a powerful hallucinogenic but also an amphetamine. The delivery charge is more expensive than the drug and the consequences are frightening,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Supt Bingham said underground sites such as Silkroad were well known to many young people.<br /><br />&quot;It is a growing problem as young people increasingly use the internet to source drugs. They have no idea where they come from or what is in them.&quot;<br /><br />While not wanting to give the sites publicity, Supt Bingham said parents needed to know what to look out for, such as the arrival of padded envelopes or strange behaviour in their children. He also said talk of &quot;bad batches&quot; of drugs was infuriating.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s not the batch that&#039;s dangerous, it&#039;s the taking of drugs full stop,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.news.com.au/national-news/nsw-act/deadly-150-lsd-tablets-trap-teens/story-fndo4bst-1226595054804#ixzz2Nverpyuj<br /><br />...snip....<br /><br /><br />Where do you start with tripe like this? Of interest was the mini profile of the envelops.. Just goes to prove what I always say.. Domestic or whatever true stealth is vital... stealth meaning not just padding but either hiding it or making it seem to be something else. may not be needed 99999 times but fuck me if i&#039;m the poor cunt that is the 1 that gets fuxored... wouldn&#039;t be happy.. tell ya that for free!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I have thought about the people I have known in my lifetime who as time goes on becoming more and more involved in the persecution of people like myself and how I must question the content of their souls and the value of their involvement in my life.. I mean they are, whether they know it or not, fighting on the side that would see me locked away and reviled for simple civil disobedience.. I hurt no one... ever... I&#039;m not a pussy but live by &#039;do onto others as you would have them do unto you&#039; so never steal, abuse or otherwise oppress any other individuals but because I don&#039;t follow the norm and enjoy being drunk I am forced to decide between total sobriety (even the staunchest anti drug proponents&nbsp; likely uses alcohol or caffeine or some other state altering compound) or breaking the law and risking the freedoms and liberties , such as they are .. Even if I dodge the legal issues I&#039;m still constantly having to listen to the parroted retorich and either out myself or just take it... Even we drug takers do it to each other thes4e days&nbsp; as evident in a post I read , in a meth review thread mind, from dude who thought&nbsp; &#039;all&nbsp; meth users are brain dead losers&#039; and felt obliged to share...<br /><br />So either these people, these alleged friends and so on know they are full of shit and actively damaging peoples lives through oppression (physical)and limitations a criminal record can have on your future... If they knowingly follow the propaganda and &#039;wash&#039; it onto others they are the lowest form of scum there is IMO and if they are just too dumb to know any better than they can go fuck off and lick some other guys windows... No Tards Welcome Here!!<br /><br />some other articles;<br /><br />**CLEAR NET AHEAD** ---&gt;<br /><br />http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/blackmarket-drug-stores-rife-with-crime/story-fnat7jnn-1226598842837<br /><br />http://www.hotheadlines.com.au/redirect.php?h=Federal_police_announce_record_Australian_drug_ice_seizure_Herald_Sun&amp;artid=1998410<br /><br />http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/customs-and-border-protection-officials-note-stagging-jump-in-detections/story-fndo471r-1226476081123<br /><br />

				The hypocrisy of how our governments deal with what is essentially a health promotion and education issue is astounding. Have a headache? then take this pill and feel better... want to get smashed off your face and roll around in your own vomit? you go son! spend those dollars and pay your taxes, the government likes the revenue from alcohol and tobacco, helps fill the coffers so they can wage war on the populace who choose to take other substances that alter their mood, perception etc. Those drugs are bad! they make the workforce unproductive costing the economy lots of money that could be spent on other things like... urm a war on drugs! <br /><br />I especially find the Australian governments attitude towards drugs quite flabbergasting, having police with drug dogs at festivals and dance events, patrolling the night clubs of the cross at 3am looking for a handful of people out for a good time with a pinga in their pocket, WOW what incredibly effective use of resources you have going on there Mr PC Plod! What are the overtime rates like for a Sat night at 3am? pretty good I reckon.<br /><br />Until people actually start to question how their governments spend their taxes and say &quot;hold a minute, fuck no! I do not consent to that, I elect you to serve me not the other way around&quot; this bullshit will just continue and the powers of coercion and control will increase as they panic as they see they are fighting a war they will never win and are starting to lose more ground.<br /><br />As the late great Bill Hicks said, &quot;there&#039;s a war being fought, and the people on drugs are winning it.‚Äù<br /><br />

These are not dumb people for the most part and deep down must know the logic and integrity of the information they are feeding the public is just not right... Self interest being such as it is though means that the salary and office they have as part of their jobs (blood money IMO) ensures they keep fighting the evil powers of truth and fact.<br /><br />The latest article I read talks about how the cops now want to be able to ban people from going into festivals if they have been picked up with drugs... miserable fucking assholes!! its not enough they target children and and do so where they know they will get some poor inexperienced person now they want to be able to put a punishment in place before the person has even had their day in court... <br /><br />While the pigs are busy patting themselves on the back after another night trawling the streets for these evil drug using types and are doing the paperwork to ensure the commissions gets paid on time to them (heh) we have young women being snatched from the streets of our major cities and raped/murdered etc...&nbsp; well lit streets that should be if not safe enough to allow someone a safe 5 minute walk home then patrolled by police and done so regularly..<br /><br />But I lament the mind set that drives the policy here in Australia.. typical example would be as follows;<br /><br />No its not a good idea to give us the right to have pepper spray, stun guns or any non-lethal defense items because they 1 out of 18 million people that MAY one day use it for badness means no one can be trusted.. no we will just put up CCTV, removing the rights of the majority so we can protect them you see, so we can see whats going on and prosecute the naughty rapist after the fact.. your still shit outta luck but rest easy knowing we have the tape for evidence... and that the Police officers, while not any help to you, have filled their quota of &#039;drug related charges&#039; and filled the coffers for another nights work of cleaning the streets of the drug scourge! <br /><br />or<br /><br />A knife you can open with one hand ? Oh no no you couldn&#039;t be allowed to have that... you may decide to do something naughty with it so by it being illegal you won&#039;t have it right? oh wait you don&#039;t care about laws.. well at least the ones that do won&#039;t have it.. even though they are the ones who need it to save their lives while rock climbing or save a finger while working on a fishing boat or whatever ..,. still at least now you will have no option but to purchase your fighting knife from one of your criminal associates and have to pay a premium for it.. you say its not good that we are helping the big crims make their money by giving them new products that they can over charge for... hmm a little keen there aren&#039;t you mate? you must be a violent&nbsp; nut to want these &#039;freedoms&#039; you talk of..<br /><br />The Vocal minority are so much loader than the sensible people of this place and the stakes are such that so many people bite their tongue rather than risk being branded a drug addict criminal... so from outside it looks like a majority are anti freedom and supporters of the prohebition platform when the reality is polar opposite..

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a good bit of the LSD offered here is 25INBOME, there has been massive drought of LSD for the past year, and it has been pretty difficult to come by even on private forums that are usually awash with it. I obtained some blotters from here that were non-perforated although with perforation marks actually printed on like the sheet was photocopied, on not blotter paper but the flimsy cardboardish paper that pamphlets are sometimes printed on. The effects were pleasant and acidish, but I was left with the clear impression that it may not be LSD. For one I saw overlay patterns on everything in my vision, an effect I have not gotten from LSD. It was more focused on covering everything with a film of transparent patterns than it was with actually enhancing what I was already seeing, as LSD tends to do. I was not really dissatisfied with the high, but at least one other person who tried these blots thought they were definitely not LSD. I don&#039;t know if they were 25INBOME or what, I didn&#039;t try ever to swallow one without holding it under my tongue, but I wouldn&#039;t be very surprised if it wasn&#039;t LSD honestly. disclaimer: I am often quite doubtful that what I have taken is really LSD, but in all fairness I think quite a lot of things sold as LSD are various LSD like analogs. I am quite confident I have had real deal LSD on several occasions though, GDF WoW in particular.

				I&#039;ll be honest: I think I agree with kmfkewm a little bit more every fucking day... fuck these people trying to tell me how to live.&nbsp; Fuck them right into their goddamn graves.&nbsp; Still alive, preferably; alive for a few hours yet, at least...<br /><br />On a less caustic note, this is a police officer?&nbsp; He has nothing whatsoever to do with investigating Silk Road or the mail.&nbsp; He knows less about it than we do for fuck&#039;s sake.&nbsp; Anything he says should only be taken as ignorant misinformation.&nbsp; It&#039;s the postal inspector&#039;s office that has a clue what they&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; He probably made up the package description the same way he&#039;s made up most of the shit he wastes his life -- not to mention ours, as well -- believing.<br /><br />Ignore his statements.

Good thing I don&#039;t have parents to worry about snooping my mail (i have BIG issues with kids using SR and its too easily used against the adults by these types.. but that just my personal feelings on that) and the only person getting close enough to notice these &#039;flags&#039; apart from the postie (too much going on to notice every item delivered) is my good self... <br /><br />the most effective way these sorts get people believing the hype is to hide a misdirection to a false statement within a shell of loosely related truths... <br /><br />&#039;You know the grass is healthy when its green and spongy and if you have a profession lawn service tend to it the benefits are obvious.. the lawn services have super genetically enhanced sprays that make your lawn look as good as it does so are wll worth the money..&quot;<br /><br />Yes your right... <br />green spongy grass = healthy<br />Lawn service = straight lines during mowing and good edge work which stands out<br />didn&#039;t know about the sprays thing but you haven&#039;t led me astray thus far so this must be true too.. besides benefit of the doubt extends as you work for the Government and they only want to help me...<br /><br />side note... I remember a feedback I read on a Hammer dealers vendor page from a young person.. was along the lines of <br /><br />&quot;first time trying heroin but boy was it awesome! had to take a day off school to get the mail before mom and dad did but wasn&#039;t disappointed!! ordered again already and will buy from this vendor again and again&quot; <br /><br />TBH it broke the rose colored glasses I had viewed SR with and really made me sad for the future that kid has just cemented... much like some view Meth as a losers substance I view opiates as the express way to a complete loss of self worth and integrity shortly before an offensive death leaving those people behind to be staunch anti drug campaigners with a tear jerking story to use at will...... <br /><br /><br />lol
