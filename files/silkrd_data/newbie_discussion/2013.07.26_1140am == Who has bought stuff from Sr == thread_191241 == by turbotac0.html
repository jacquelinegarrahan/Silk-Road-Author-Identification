				Just do it. You&#039;re going to be paranoid and nervous until the package arrives at your doorstep. Just find a vendor with great reviews especially on their shipping snd stealth and you will be all good. <br /><br />Also always brush up on what to do and sayand handle your shit in the rare instance that something goes south (ie LEO showing up at your doorstep). And always treat each order like it&#039;s your first. Never get too complacent. <br /><br />Also, check out fungifun. Stealth is frigging amazing. I would stay away from the capsules though as I experienced a loss in potency due to the heat it incurred during shipping. But his service is stellar.

Remember that vendors have lives outside of SR as well. I have had an order sitfor days before being marked in transit. Some vendors only mail a day or two out of the week. Wait to see how nervous yet excited you are once you notice it marked in transit.

				If you&#039;re looking for INCREDIBLE shrooms and are worried about stealth you should check out this guy http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b19a3508da He has a rare and potent strain and his stealth is the best I have ever seen on the road, and I&#039;ve been here for awhile. I can assure you when you open it you will first be confused, and then that confusion will slowly turn to pure joy when you realize you&#039;ve just received high grade drugs in the mail ;D

But weed in small amounts is really not a big deal at all. If you&#039;re only getting an oz or something it&#039;s usually packaged up so well that no one is the wiser. Once you start getting LBs shipped to you then you might have legitimate cause for concern ;)

				like everyone has said you will be fine, i know buyers that get all sorts of products in different amounts and what not and havent had issues....as long as the vendors do the research and utilize top notch stealth and shipping practices you should be fine...research your vendors and ask questions my friend....most vendors will answer any concern wen it comes to shipping and what not

My first legit purchase was for an OZ of shrooms and everything went swimmingly. Buy 1btc and mess around with the lotteries/online books for small purchases up front and then once you feel comfortable go ahead and buy yourself some drugs!

				I would not spend more than 50-60 USD on anything for your first purchase. <br /><br />You never know what will truly transpire, and I&#039;d rather have dealt with the vendor in the past before I go and drop a few hundred in their lap.<br /><br />stick with domestic to ease your paranoia, going to the EU for shit is cheaper but also riskier and much longer of a process

				Do people really get screwed doing this..

				I generally just order domestic. The chances of your domestic orders getting intercepted are incredibly slim. Just make sure you go with a good vendor with lots of high reviews. I&#039;ve ordered of some lesser known vendors and seen some horrific stealth. One guy wrote my address in pen and spelled it wrong. Not to mention it was in a white envelope with nothing else inside of it but my drugs which you could feel through the packaging. Even this managed to get to me no questions asked. Stick to domestic and high rated vendors and you should have no problems.<br /><br />good stealthy vendors :<br /><br />Techno Hippy<br />KQueen<br />Makahala

				i have been on SR for awhile and had plenty of transactions go thru without any problem....i actually have more of a problem with scamming ass coin vendors, i do extensive research on the forums and SR when i choose a vendor and the products are on point but i use established vendors as well, but im also not big into the whole hardcore drug scene so other people might have issues there but cannabis wise and psychedelic wise i have had zero problems and i have had alot of transactions worth some $ and have been very pleased with what the Road has provided me

				Be careful though even top rated vendors aren&#039;t perfect. I placed an order with a top rated vendor and still got burnt. Something happened and two of his shipments didn&#039;t make it out. He came back and offered refunds to everyone who didn&#039;t receive their package. But before I could respond to his pm and accept the refund he went into stealth mode and hasn&#039;t been back in a month.

				One great tip I could offer is: &#039;never get anything sent to your house or your name&#039;<br /><br />Over the last couple of years Ive had almost 100% success rate this way from hundreds of packages, and have only had a few packages go missing, which I suspect was more to do with greed from the person receiving the mail than it was from it not actually showing up.<br /><br />The one main argument against this is that the package will get through easier and arouse less suspicion if the shipping details are legit and under your name (which is only true - and only to a certain point - for a few aspects of standard shipping practices). Its SO EASY to circumnavigate this issue, just takes a little planning.<br /><br />A few things to consider when doing it this way but def much safer, especially for me with long international flights and tight customs.<br /><br />One of the core rules I have lived by for years now is &#039;once you&#039;re on their radar, you&#039;re on their radar&#039;. This principle helps govern my every move and has assisted in keeping me safe for a very long time now.<br /><br />PE
