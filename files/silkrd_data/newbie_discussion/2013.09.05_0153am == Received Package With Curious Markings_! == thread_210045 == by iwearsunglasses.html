				Not sure if anyone that reads this thread will be able to help me out but its worth a try I suppose. <br /><br />The last two packages that my friends received had a blue &quot;?&quot; on the front of the envelope. Is this something that I should be concerned about(cuz I am). They were both from the same vendor and came as a commercial envelope(junk mail looking). The mark was written with an ink pen like someone maybe questioning the package?? Postman, Mail Inspector,?? Any insight would be great.

Product was vacuum-sealed and although the product has a slight odor once bag is opened, I couldn&#039;t smell anything when inspecting the package myself. I can say that its not weed so its not that odorous a product to begin with. The shipments were at least a month apart also so when I saw the markings the second time, I was a bit more concerned. Nothing since then has been shipped but I wanted to see if anyone else has seen this issue. <br /><br />Thanks for the help. Just waiting to spam my 50 posts now so I can take this up to the big leauge topics and see if I can get an answer.

				I honestly, wouldn&#039;t worry about it lol. If someone wants to bust you, they damn sure will without any hesitation. If they are waiting to bust you they will leave no signs at all or drop any hints. The point is for you to not know what&#039;s going to happen, not to give you little clues. It could very well be from your vendor and that&#039;s how he labels his stuff for whatever reason, whether it&#039;s to keep track of what he is sending out or some way for him to sort his material. I have no idea. This is all speculation, but I wouldn&#039;t sweat it.

				My mail guy marked a package with a red ?, not one to me but to the landlord. I saw him the next day and asked, he said the mail people mark them like that when delivering if the name is not familiar so you see it and don&#039;t open it. Did you use an odd or fake name? So I told him the deal and he was cool.

				Do the envelopes have the little bar code strips on them. Usually somewhere ner the bottom. If they do. This question mark is due to those and this vendors should source another decoy envelope system. These are used by companies such as Credit Card, marketing, banking, etc to literally watch payments as they come across the country or globe. In the case of financial institutions they use this to forecast sales, income, payments, ect. If it does have this. It may be throwing a flag due to the address not going to or from where the code says it should. And this is a increase in risk. I wouldnt suspect negligence on the vendor as much as lack of knowledge. Check the envelopes for the codes.
