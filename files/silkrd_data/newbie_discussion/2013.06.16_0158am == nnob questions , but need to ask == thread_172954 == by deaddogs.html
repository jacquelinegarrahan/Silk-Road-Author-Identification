				HI,<br /><br />So I&#039;m ready i think to make a first purchases but i really would like a better idea of how the process works, i usually find out by just diving in and figure out as we go along but id rather not do that here.<br /><br />I have read just about all the wiki but i still have a couple of questions.<br /><br />When i purchases :-<br />&nbsp; What is the normal means of communication between buyer and seller ?<br />&nbsp; Should all messages be encrypted , even on the sr private messages ?<br />&nbsp; If the buyer shows an email addy does that mean he wants all messages encrypted and sent on this addy (not to use the sr messaging)?<br /><br />Iv just kinda figured that this forum does not send out email notifications (spent a day trying to set it up to my tormail :-/ ). I assume this is for security reasons , but if its a security problem from the forum then how is it not a problem on sr itself ?<br /><br />If vendors and buyers are mainly using the sr messaging system then how do they get notification of communication ? or do they/we just sit watching the sr messages all the time ?<br /><br />I suppose my main question is how do people know when they need to respond to something quickly when email seems to be a NON option.<br /><br />Cheers all,&nbsp;

				As far as encryption goes, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s absolutely necessary to do every time but it&#039;s certainly an extra layer of security that isn&#039;t hard to manage. There are tutorials on Youtube that literally walk you through it step by step. Even if you aren&#039;t worried about your own security, it&#039;s a nice gesture toward the vendor, too, and it seems like the majority of vendors have public keys up (and therefore support encryption).<br /><br />As far as notifications go, I just log in once a day and see if I have any messages. I like the fact that I don&#039;t get emails when I have a notification because I don&#039;t want this site tied to anything of mine outside of it -including my emails. That said, I also don&#039;t expect people to get back to me within an hour or something because I realize Tor and the site aren&#039;t meant to be fully accessible on the go at any time. It&#039;s a small price to pay for anonymity, in my opinion.

				Hi,<br /><br />Well yea i would agree completely , its just that when your in the middle of a transaction and something suddenly needs to be resolved it could be quite time important.&nbsp; i see a comment on here today from some of the vendors saying that because the captcha was not working today that they were getting worried that customers communications were not getting the rapid response they should expect. Also when you place an order with a vendor does he not get notified in some way (surely he must do) unless they are sitting watching all the time. <br /><br />It just made me wonder.<br /><br />surely you cant do business on a &quot;check in&quot; once a day kinda thing.<br /><br />Cheers

				When you place your order there will be a box for you to type your address in.&nbsp; Encrypt your shipping address and put it in this box. <br /><br />Any Communications between you and the seller that might give information about your location should be encrypted.&nbsp; All other communications can be sent unencrypted. If a vendor lists an eMail that is usually to communicate with them if SR is down.<br /><br />To the best of my knowledge SR does not send out any eMail or Notifications outside of the server that it is loaded on.&nbsp; You will need to login daily to check if an order is in transit, however vendors usually will send a PM on SR to you when they ship the product.<br /><br />

You only need to encrypt sensitive info, like your address or a tracking code (which reveals your address). Messages inquiring about a product or asking if it has shipped shouldn&#039;t be encrypted.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; If the buyer shows an email addy does that mean he wants all messages encrypted and sent on this addy (not to use the sr messaging)?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s better to send all messages through SR. In case there is a dispute, and you are in the right, that conversation history can help the admins make a determination. Anyone can make up messages sent through other channels.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Iv just kinda figured that this forum does not send out email notifications (spent a day trying to set it up to my tormail :-/ ).

SelfSovereignty made a desktop client called MetaSilk that will log in and notify you of orders and messages, which makes that a little easier.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I suppose my main question is how do people know when they need to respond to something quickly when email seems to be a NON option.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Log onto the site. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />It would be difficult to add a proper email notification system, and it would introduce unnecessary risks.<br />

				Excellent reply astor, TY for that.<br /><br />I shall have to check out what was created by SelfSovereignty (if its available to the general public (well road runners anyhow)) , or maybe even code something myself , i have a completely separate comp that is entirely encrypted so i dont have to worry to much about whats on this comp but im not sure about automating the connection , but could always just automate tor and read the page source and look for changes etc, hmm sorry just thinking allowed :-/<br /><br />Anyhow , yea explained a lot for me,<br /><br />Thx.
