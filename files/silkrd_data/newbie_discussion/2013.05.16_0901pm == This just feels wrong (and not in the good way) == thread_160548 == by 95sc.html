				This 50 message requirement not only wastes time it dilutes the quality of the content on the forum.&nbsp; Now, when people do searches looking for a particular topic all these junk posts are intertwined in the results.&nbsp; So, for anyone doing a search and seeing this or any of my other spam needed to reach 50 posts, I sincerely apologize.&nbsp; There has to be a better way.

				For instance, a better way to handle this would be a manditory test that new users are required to take and pass before their account is upgraded.&nbsp; The test should be made up of questions that can only be answered by reading existing forum posts that are important to the success of the board and SR in general.&nbsp; An example would be to take one question from each of the forum &quot;stickies&quot; thereby ensuring that new users at least skimmed them.&nbsp; However, with this system I&#039;m spending my time making junk posts instead of learning about the community, what makes it tick, and what needs to be done to sustain it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not cool...<br />

				Once you get to 50, you will care a lot less about the reasons and the potential pitfalls of the 50 post rule. ;)<br /><br />Never seen it affecting any of my search results either tbh,

				If you used the forums as they are intended, instead of just wanting to join in with the big boys discussion, you&#039;d avoid spamming up their threads with questions you could have learned if you&#039;d done it as intended. I found my n00b time invaluable. I &quot;met&quot; some great people, and we have kept a thread alive updating each other on gear and vendors, people have even helped each other out, a 0.37 BTC loan yesterday, there&#039;s some incredible people on here, take the time to find them.

				Fair enough, SugarFree&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ll put more effort into using this time to learn rather than just racking up post numbers.<br /><br />Of all the things you&#039;ve learned about the fourum and the road in general, what do you wish someone had shared with you on day one?&nbsp; In other words, do you have any seasoned advice you&#039;d be willing to share with me as a new member who has yet to buy or even deal with BTC?<br /><br />

				I find it odd that you criticise the dilution of content through the 50 post limit, yet you are spamming this thread. It&#039;s easy to at least partially participate in useful dialogue.

				Bloody good question. If you are in the UK, which you&#039;re probably not, there&#039;s BitBargain for buying BTC, it&#039;s simple and extremely quick. Are you prepared to divulge your country? Feel free not to. Advice to live by on here, and probably in real life (IRL) is, if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid finalizing early (FE), but being a new customer it&#039;s very hard. What products are you interested in?

				I started off spamming then decided to slow down and have at least some content to my posts. But then again, without the 50 requirement I would be more selective on my posting - for example this one. The requirement seems a little silly to me but there may be some advantages if you take the time to make 50 real posts so I&#039;ll try to make them count at least somewhat.<br /><br />On information sharing - I&#039;ve probably already shared more information than I should about my life. I guess I don&#039;t worry too much about it because as a personal use buyer I don&#039;t think I&#039;m much of a target for authorities. One good thing is that they can&#039;t use the buyers to get to the sellers on here since there&#039;s no direct contact so it makes the users even less of a target - at least to my thinking. I&#039;m more concerned that sharing information may make me a target for scammers so will try to hold back a little. Still I think being careful is good practice and will do so as to limit any possible problems for the venders.
