				I&#039;ve heard that as well. All technical stuff aside, I&#039;ve always wanted to try DMT, but I&#039;m kind of scared of taking the plunge. Also with all the stuff going on here on the SR, I&#039;ve been laying low. Shits getting crazy around here. I haven&#039;t ordered herb in over two months and that&#039;s the main reason I come here.

				I know where you&#039;re coming from. It took me 2 months of research and contemplation to finally make the decision to try DMT.&nbsp; Each time has been a truly excellent experience and it is nothing to be fearful of. The best advice would be start off with a threshold dose (20-30mg) for an insight of what you&#039;re letting yourself in for, gradually working your way up to a breakthrough dose (50mg+)&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ve had lots of Salvia experience prior to DMT, now I have taken both, DMT is a walk in the park in comparison... Salvia can sometimes bring on &quot;the fear&quot;.<br /><br />

				Hey keith how u doing man? I messaged you before and made me an offer of a freebie of DMT,<br /><br />Jus noticed you had a thread so thought id comment, Ive tried salvia a handful of&nbsp; times and didnt properly breakthrough i have cheap shit smoking apparatus, there was one occassion i smoked 40X and i cant recall anything it was totally different from any other time, The main effect it has on me is amnesia just cant remember what i just did.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is DMT a more pleasurable experience would you say or does it have a similar feel to salvia?, I didnt think id ever get the opportunity to try DMT but SR opens so many doors as does DMT ha, Whats the best way to smoke it without an expensive vapourizer?<br /><br />a glass pipe and if yea what size? I was going to try using a cheap glass bubble vapourizer do you know the one i mean, its like £10-£15 but i wont bother if its just going to waste the DMT , or theres the vapour genie vapourizer i think its good for cannabis but ive heard its useless for DMT any ideas?<br /><br />I know its a long post man ha....<br /><br />Cheers

				Im not in any rush to try it just knowing that i have access to DMT is fine for me for now, its not something to take lightly from what ive read it can have astounding benificial effects on your perception or just life in general. they want it kept illegal, the masses cant handle the truth ha<br /><br />Later guys
