				SR noob here. One successful transaction thus far from MarijuanaIsMyMuse. Wrote a review on it, and then forgot my damn login info, because I&#039;m a fucking genius. <br /><br />Anyways, in an effort to build my post count, but do so in a way that isn&#039;t just spam, here&#039;s a few tips I&#039;ve picked up over the last ten years of buying shit online, and I&#039;ll phrase them in a way that is specific to SR.<br /><br />1.) Don&#039;t be a cunt.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you bought a gram of coke, and it was just absolute shit. Maybe it got you high, maybe it didn&#039;t. Maybe it burned your nostrils like snorting jizz off a dragon&#039;s dick. You have two options. You can send the seller an angry message telling him he&#039;s an asshole, that his product sucks, and leave some angry, negative feedback. That will satisfy your rage over being ripped off, but it won&#039;t do much to actually remedy the situation. The second option? Send him a message. Put your rage aside, and write something mature. &quot;Hey man, I got my stuff, but I gotta say, it really isn&#039;t what I expected. I know you have good feedback and all, so maybe you just got a bad batch that you hadn&#039;t tried out for yourself, but the stuff I was really pretty terrible. You might wanna check your batch.&quot;<br /><br />This at least opens the realm of possibility that the seller IS honest, and simply got scammed himself. He might do a line and think, &quot;What the fuck, that guy is right!&quot; And maybe he&#039;ll apologize, and offer to give you a bit of a refund. If you send an angry message, this won&#039;t be an option for you. Don&#039;t fucking abuse this though. Don&#039;t say the shit is bad when it isn&#039;t just because you&#039;re a cheap cunt, which brings me to number 2.<br /><br />2.) Karma.<br /><br />If someone doesn&#039;t deliver on their promise, write about the experience. Don&#039;t say things like &quot;This fucking dick sent me a bag of flower and ran off with my money, the fucking cocksucker!&quot; Say, &quot;This vendor did not come through with the transaction. Here is exactly how.&quot;. Be specific, leave details, but don&#039;t be an antagonistic dick. If they&#039;re putting out bad karma, they&#039;ll get it back. No need for you to put out some bad karma as well after a bad experience. Simply state exactly what occurred. Trust me on this one. <br /><br />In contrast, if someone does come through on their transaction, fucking say so. Don&#039;t just leave positive feedback, write a review on the forums, or anywhere else that you can anonymously discuss SR. If a vendor sees that when he sells to you, he will get more than just the regular &quot;positive feedback&quot;, he will be less likely to want to fuck you over in the future. An honest vendor will want to make sure they get more positive reviews from you, and a dishonest vendor will want to make sure your reviews lure people into their potentially dishonest service. Either way, it benefits you.<br /><br />3.) Humanize yourself.<br /><br />Anytime I am buying something online, if I have the option to send a person a message, I do. Why? Because that changes you from meaningless data into slightly less meaningless words. Is it easier to lie to your girlfriend over text, or face to face? Is it easier for a vendor to scam you if you&#039;re just a tx#, or if you&#039;ve sent them a message saying &quot;Hey man, just ordered this from you. Looking forward to trying it. If it&#039;s good, I&#039;ll be sure to tell my friends about it.&quot;<br /><br />4.) Never, ever, EVER, for any reason or circumstance, finalize early.<br /><br />If you were buying from some shady guy on a street corner, and he said, &quot;Yeah, yeah man, just give me 100 bucks, I&#039;ll be back in 15 minutes, I swear&quot;, would you fucking trust that? He doesn&#039;t see the money until you see the product. Period. That&#039;s the only time when you finalize. It doesn&#039;t matter how good the feedback is. It doesn&#039;t matter how good the reviews are. It doesn&#039;t matter if you have bought from him 100 times before. You finalize only when you get the product. Only. And when you do see the product, you better damn well give the guy his fucking money. If you think you&#039;re gonna be smart and try to tell a seller that your package didn&#039;t come when it actually did, it won&#039;t take very long before it bites you in the ass, and you&#039;ll be back to buying shitty cut coke from some junky downtown instead of having a resource like SR. If you get the goods, you fucking finalize that shit. Karma you faggots. If you think you can out run it, then you haven&#039;t lived as long as I, and you&#039;re in for a real surprise when life finally decides to teach you how it works.
