				Anyones tracking #&#039;s working?<br /><br />Seems alot of people (myself included) cannot track their packages. Mine shipped out sat at 7:08am utc.<br /><br />Got the #14 hours ago, after asking twice for it, and it hasn&#039;t shown up in usps&#039;s system, really hope it was in fact mailed on sat, and not just purchased, to be shipped on monday.<br /><br />Anyone else in the same boat as i am?<br /><br />BTW, i bought on of his escrow listings, no way im fe&#039;ing on such a new vendor, and nobody should either. Kind of sketchy now that you think about it, but i&#039;m not saying its a scam, just a bit odd.

I&#039;m not sure when on Monday it was available, I just know it wasn&#039;t available before I left for work in the AM but was available in the afternoon when I got home.<br /><br />USPS.com had given me a projected delivery date, and they missed it by a day. It came the next day. Clearly not mrgood247&#039;s fault though, it was lagged up at some postage facility for a day.<br /><br />I know when I had questions about my order he was extremely forthcoming and easy to communicate with. I got good vibes from him, and felt like he&#039;s an honest vendor. As for his FE special, I was going to try that out next time I used him, because it&#039;s significant savings and the first transaction went so well... We&#039;ll see though. Good luck, hope it gets there for you on time!

				It was dropped off at the destination po this morning at 9am. <br /><br />Since i live in a rural area, i get fucked over for two days.<br /><br />This guy is a liar. He said my order was SHIPPED on saturday. It was shipped this morning. <br /><br />Unless USPS fucked up, he&#039;s not going to get a 5/5 from me. <br /><br />

				Sorry to beat a dead horse, but just to clarify... Is there a date for estimated delivery when you track it? I know with mine it was on the far right side of the screen listed under the &quot;additional services&quot; column or something. That shows the shipping as two days out still?

				So now he gets all pissy about it. <br /><br />Fucking professional.<br /><br />IF you got the package in by the cutoff date, saturday morning, which i was on time for, it should have been scanned at least once before monday morning. Acceptance means the package was handed off to a usps employee, so i&#039;m goning to assume thats the date it was shipped on, wouldn&#039;t you?<br /><br />If you dropped it in a usps box, i highly doubt that they did not pick up the usps express priority and scan it somewhere along the line. <br /><br />Sure, perhaps the pickup was late, but they would take care of that. Not accept the package as it states on my tracking on MONDAY.<br /><br />Just admit you got backed up with orders, and it went out on monday. <br /><br />365 days a week, and i get a scheduled delivery date of wednesday for a package mailed on saturday?<br /><br />Dont fuckin think so.<br /><br />

				I feel for ya man, I know how it is to get sick. All I can say is that my experience with the same vendor went better than that. All the same circumstances, for the most part... except a week prior, and I landed on the lucky side of the package going out the day it was marked IN TRANSIT. <br /><br />Best of luck to you in your future endeavors. <br /><br />If it helps at all, I&#039;ve had good turnaround from surpremesmoke (although prices are steeper, and vendor doesn&#039;t ship on Saturdays or provide tracking numbers... but solid nonetheless). Also, I just received my first order from DieselTherapy, it came is exactly as described and on time. Seneca was a good vendor, but has been MIA as of late... Hmmm... Otherwise, mrgood247 was the only other vendor I&#039;ve had good luck with. <br /><br />Again, better luck to you in the future, and my thoughts are with you during the next two days of waiting. For whatever that&#039;s worth.

				Well i got my order today.<br /><br />The date accepted says 9/23 ~9am. <br /><br />Thanks for the kind words, the w/d&#039;s are over now, and i&#039;ve decided to taper with the help of a trusted friend, and get some methadone to finish that process off. This orderal scared the shit out of me, how different i am when i&#039;m withdrawing. I&#039;m not capable of using responsibly, so i need to commit to putting this behind me. <br /><br />Regarding my issues with mrgood, i realize now that i was a bit out of line in my previous posts, and would like to apologise to him. Still, the shipping problem, i cannot belive is usps&#039;s fault alone. I still believe it was shipped on monday, not saturday. Growing pains, and high order demand is understandable, i just wanted the truth on when my order was shipped. Thats the only issue i have at this point. The fault doesn&#039;t lie with usps, mrgood, or myself, alone. But neither of these parties are absolved from their share of blame.<br /><br />I probably won&#039;t order again, but thats just because i want to get clean, and the issues with the seller/shipping. If you don&#039;t need your dope in a ridgid, urgent timeframe, i&#039;d reccomend him. Good prices/good dope. But i could have been happier with this transaction, if there was a bit more honesty involved. If that had been the case, i would not have gotten so nasty, even if was in w/d&#039;s at the time. <br /><br />Please disregard my pevious posts, i won&#039;t edit them out for purposes of transparency, but disregard the content of the posts. I wasn&#039;t myself at the time.

Takes a big man to own up to that sort of thing. And I doubt there are very many people on SR that haven&#039;t been in the very situation you found yourself in.<br /><br />As for getting clean, if I may make a suggestion... Suboxone, in my opinion, is a much, much better option for kicking the dope. From what I&#039;ve experienced in my own struggles when I&#039;ve let it go too far, methadone works but then there&#039;s a huge issue with kicking methadone. It&#039;s almost as though you replace one demon with another. <br /><br />When I was at the depths of my abuse, I went to a doctor who specializes in opiate addiction recovery. He prescribed suboxone strips and told me that I should plan to stay on them for six months, starting out with two (2) 8mg strips per day. I&#039;m a bit of a stubborn guy and chose to be more aggressive about it, and instead went with one strip per day, and did it for only a month. Then for the next month after that, I would do a strip whenever the itch got bad enough. <br /><br />Everybody is different and I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any one recipe that can suit each person. But I do know that if you truly want to kick the stuff, it can be done. Surround yourself with people who care about you and your health, and be open with some of them about your issues so that you have somebody you can talk to when it gets hard to cope. The desire to get loaded will always be something to live with, but how you manage that will determine your success. <br /><br />All of this coming from a guy who currently uses probably doesn&#039;t amount to much, I suppose, but I&#039;m on my own path. I&#039;ve found that I can use on occasion and kick the stuff before I let it get out of control. Took years of epic fails to figure out how to manage my own use, but for the time being, what I do works for me. <br /><br />Best of luck to you man, and if there&#039;s ever anything I can do to help let me know. <br /><br />Regarding mrgood247, have you sent him a PM to apologize to him directly? I&#039;m sure he&#039;d appreciate that.
