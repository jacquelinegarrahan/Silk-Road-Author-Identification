				Hello everyone, new user here. Before I make my first bitcoin purchase, I&#039;d like to know what percentage over the purchase price of the SR item I&#039;ve got my eye on should I buy, in order to cover all associated costs with both purchasing bitcoins and buying through SR?<br /><br />So.. if I&#039;d like to buy a 1/4 of top-shelf bud for $100(including shipping), should I purchase ~$115 of BitCoin to cover all fees? I realize it will vary from BitCoin reseller to BitCoin reseller and my method of paying for that BitCoin, but just assume I have plenty of time and am willing to hunt for the cheapest(and yet honest) reseller I could find. As a rough estimate, how much of the purchase price do YOU usually pay to cover all fees?<br /><br />I appreciate any information you worldly SR users could provide. Thank you.

				The cost of obtaining bitcoins varies wildly from 0% to 25% or so. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s why nobody answered your question right away. You&#039;d be better off asking the bitcoin seller this question.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;d probably figure on an Extra 10% over fees just to cover fluctuations in the exchange rate between bitcoins and your country&#039;s currency.

				each transfer thru a wallet will cost you .0005% or 5 cents on $100, so the wallet cost isn&#039;t much<br />it&#039;s the fluctuation on the btc&#039;s value - vendors seem to adjust it automatically and probably have a fudge factor built into to - but for example when i started looking about the 20th of last month, btc had dropped to $68 per, then by the 1st had popped over $100, when i bought it had fallen a couple of bucks to $99 but i paid my seller from localbitcoins $104 in cash (didn&#039;t feel like a bad exchange commission + i got to keep my anonymity - like porn star said 10% over will probably be fine -
