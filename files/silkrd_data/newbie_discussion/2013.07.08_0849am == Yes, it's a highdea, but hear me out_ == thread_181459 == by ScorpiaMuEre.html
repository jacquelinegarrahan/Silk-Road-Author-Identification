				This is &quot;50 post rule&quot; topic, so feel free to bail now.<br /><br />Why not make karma count for a bit more?<br /><br />- Change 50 post rule to 50 karma rule<br />&nbsp; - Allow karma to improve by 1 for each post<br />&nbsp; - Negative net karma will banish you automatically until your karma improves from the drivel you&#039;ve managed to post (on it&#039;s own merits)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Anyone with equal or higher karma than you can give you karma ratings (allows everyone to kill spammers)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Everyone starts at 1 with a history of 0 posts. At 1 post, your karma would be 2/0. Someone who hasn&#039;t posted yet (at 1/0) could come along and rate your post (which was posted when you were at 1/0, so is a 1/0 post when comparing with someone else&#039;s karma).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Once you obtain a specific level of karma, you can rate anyone&#039;s post, regardless of their karma, say the same level as whatever the karma minimum is for the other boards, 50.<br />&nbsp; - Allows positive contributors to the community the ability to gain access to other boards quicker<br />&nbsp; - Would improve the quality of the newbie forum just by nature of karma meaning more (now it lets you post to real boards faster!)<br />&nbsp; - To allow for further refinement, individual boards should adjust their minimum karma requirements. For instance, the Vendor Review board should be a board by itself available to members at a relatively obtainable karma. Spammers would be quickly dealt with by the karma they receive from their posts.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Could also allow for boards to be hidden from those without the requisite level of karma, but you could also do this with any arbitrary level assigning method of forum control.<br />&nbsp; - Turns everyone into moderators who&#039;s power is proportional to how he posts on the board<br /><br />That&#039;s about all the different points my cannabis-addled brain could come up with. I realize that not every highdea is leonardo level flying machines, but this one I believe has merit. Please rate and comment on my post as you will, I will try and be present enough to post coherent responses. I am at the mercy of your keyboard!

				Still thinking here. What about as a deterrent for griefing, perhaps, until you reach a certain karma level, every point you remove from someone also reduces your own by one.
