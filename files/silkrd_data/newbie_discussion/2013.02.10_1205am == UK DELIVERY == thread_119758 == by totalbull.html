				Have any members had problems receiving goods shipped to the UK from overseas? In particular I am more concerned with our over zealous crime prevention units! Which countries supplying materials will flag up potential problems and alert the authorities? <br /><br />Any true success stories would be welcome.<br /><br />Thanks

				Spain , usa , belgium , canada , germany, netherlands , france, italy, all went through okay for me .. Had to have 1 reship from the netherlands though.<br /><br />I would say being shipped from south america and netherlands would possibly flag the package..<br />&nbsp;<br />Also shitty vendor packaging flags it regardless of the country.<br />And super stealth packaging from risk countries would probably make it through.

				haven&#039;t had any issues with vendors in the EU, Canada or USA. well lost one from mr ouid but that was a case of his shipping method being identified and a whole lot got seized his side of the pond. it wasn&#039;t tracked delivery so he said no refund or anything. i ordered one a while after from puff daddy to the same address just to test and it got through fine so i don&#039;t think i&#039;m on any watchlist.. maybe steer clear of those vendors shipping out 1000&#039;s of packages a week as they&#039;ll get profiled quicker. the same thing happened to budmail in the past.<br />be careful if you&#039;re trying to import cartons of cigarettes though, they&#039;re getting stopped more than illegal drugs. here tax evasion and terrorism are the main priorities. gotta love the system. i wouldn&#039;t order anything massive from USA because they frequently open those (clothing size packs) up to see if they can tax you on the contents. an oz or 2 should be ok but be prepared for it to be compressed. <br />top tip: every time you order research the vendor, their shipping methods and success rates to your country. the forums are a goldmine and a lot of vendors/substances have dedicated threads.

				Speaking as another person from the UK I&#039;ve ordered from all over the world, including flagged counties in south america and holland have arrived, I&#039;ve had two issues out of my countless transactions one never showed up but the reship did and the other that never showed up but nor did anyone&#039;s at the time I received a full refund. If you wish to veer on the side of caution and test the water first order from an established vendor, however I&#039;ve ordered from many new vendors who have been great. If you decide to go for it I wish you all the best with your first overseas order, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine :)

				I recently ordered from my first non-UK vendor - 7g of mushrooms. Hopefully all will go well, and if it does, I&#039;ll be ordering some acid from the Netherlands. Fingers crossed!

				I&#039;m waiting for my 3rd overseas purchase to arrive and I have every confidence it will do so.<br /><br />Sure it&#039;s a greater risk as the packages will pass through UK customs, but with some EU vendors offering decent weed at half the price of even the cheapest UK vendors, for me it&#039;s a no-brainer.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t FE then the risk is all the vendors&#039;.<br />
