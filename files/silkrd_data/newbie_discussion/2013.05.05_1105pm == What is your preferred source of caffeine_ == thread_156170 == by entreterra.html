				My routine is a strong cup of joe in the morning. Followed 4-8 hours later by a cup of black tea to ease the crash from the coffee. <br /><br />Occasionally I will drink yerba mat√©, but usually once every few weeks.

				Blotter caffeine (if only!).<br />I wish all drugs, including RX and OTCs, came in blotter form. Doing medicine would be so much more fun! Gotta headache? Drop an Aspirin.

Now I make my coffee very strong where it gets that yellowish foam that around the edge of the pot/cup. If it&#039;s not jet black, strong coffee I sometimes feel slight withdrawal symptoms from not getting enough caffeine. Luckily for the time being it&#039;s been just this one cup in the morning with some tea in the afternoon. I&#039;ve heard some people who drink 5-10 cups of coffee a day and even crazy addictions where people are taking like 30 espresso shots throughout the day. I guess there are worse addictions to be had, but caffeine can still get nasty.

				I really don&#039;t like hot drinks. I will occasionally have coffee, but it&#039;s quite rare and honestly messes my stomach up pretty bad. I am a Diet Coke fiend; it&#039;s a nasty addiction I know. I drink it constantly, even in the middle of the night. (It also has to be DC, Diet Pepsi tastes like what I would imagine week old ass sweat would be like). I&#039;ve been addicted to several different varieties of drugs throughout my life that I pushed through pretty easily but this one is the hardest one for me to kick.

				Arabica. It&#039;s slightly more expensive than robusta, which is an artificial strain produced as the early coffee growers wanted something a bit hardier to grow, but it is worth it. And yes, it is better to drink the black types in the morning like nuclearDelta said. Macchiato in morning followed by cappuccino at brunch followed by latte with lunch followed by Vienna or Black Cow in afternoon or evening, is usually a good rule of thumb.<br /><br />Also, speaking of caffeine, it is in tea as well as coffee. <br /><br />................................ w h a t&nbsp; d r o v e&nbsp; m e&nbsp; t o&nbsp; t h i s&nbsp; t h r e a d ........................................?<br /><br />Damn you!<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
