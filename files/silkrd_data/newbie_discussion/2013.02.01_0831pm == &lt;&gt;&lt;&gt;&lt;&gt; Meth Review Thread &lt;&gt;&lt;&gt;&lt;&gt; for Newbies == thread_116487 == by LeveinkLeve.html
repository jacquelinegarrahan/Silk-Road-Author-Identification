				Even though we have less than 50 posts we can still discuss something of value, some of us might be as experienced as the &quot;Full Members&quot;, even without being a frequent SRF user.<br />This is your chance to review the different batches of Meth we have bought and the vendors we bought it from.<br />This is your, newbies, chance to say what you think, ask what you want, how silly it might be and a chance to listen to newbie mistakes that others have made that almost never given space in the &quot;real&quot; threads.<br />Let´s make this as professional as possible and remember that this is for us by us, it´s your opinion that counts, not what someone else thinks about your opinion!<br />&nbsp;<br />

				Vendor: trip2012<br /><br />Product 5/5 <br /><br />All of you meth-heads out there know that the first time you try meth it´s not comparable to anything else, it´s wonderful, it´s fantastic, it blows away all of your problems, life gets worth living and it makes your skin crawl, makes your head feel like the tip of your cock and the buzz is so intense that if you had the chance you would end up beating of in the kids ball pit at Mickey Dee´s, that´s how fucking incredible it feels. (no I´m not a fucking, should be stabbed to death with a toothpick, asshole pedophile, just comparing how crazy it is)<br />Well maybe a got really good stuff the first time but it really felt that way.<br />The meth that I got from trip2012 felt like that! (without the kiddy-ball-pit-masturbating outcome)<br />I ordered 0,2grams, correct wight on arrival, just to try it out, new vendor and all so a little careful first time, now regretting my decision.<br />Poured it all at once into the pipe, did the mandatory crack-back and it all looked good from my experience.<br />Emptied my lungs of all air and lit it up.<br />The taste was very nice, for you who have tasted SEA ice it´s pretty much like that, and it smoked very good.<br />Lungs filled to the brim, holding my breath for a couple of seconds and I feel the energy boost exploding inside me as I blow the out a el Nino lookalike cloud.<br />The second it´s out it feels like there´s ants under my skin all over my scalp and I reach boiling point immediately and start sweating. <br />All my problems are gone, full of life, happy, creative and on and&nbsp; on and on.<br />Got about 15 massive hits from that 0,2g keeping me up for 2 days, so would be something like a week for 1g, about 70-100hits.<br /><br />Packaging 4/5<br /><br />The outside appearance could be a bit better but who knows what the custom worker will look for the day your mail passes by him/her.<br />Did not feel anything suspicious, bumps etc, from the outside, inside it´s single vacuumed, could be double for extra safety but it´s okay.<br /><br />Overall I´m super pleased with what I got from trip2012 and I will definitely order from him/her again when I got the coin.<br /><br /><br /><br />(My stats: +30 orders, +$3000 spent so far)

				Since I&#039;m now banned from the main meth thread for another 30 odd posts I&#039;ll just put in&nbsp; a quick good word for DubG.<br />He tends to be a little pricey and slow to ship but his quality is second to none and his packaging is superb.<br />Definitely worth the wait and coin.

				Meth is always better with a nice chill comedown with some benzos. By the time I get 50 posts I&#039;m gonna be using my own product. I feel taht all my posts have to have legible sentences so I&#039;ll be here a while I guess :P So who here sticks it out and does stims without benzos or something to relax after? I won&#039;t touch high doses of stims without some benzos and a bit of opiates.

				Hey Lev, since i smell some experience, doesn&#039;t it seem like the ice you get these days looks like ice, smokes like ice, etc - but there&#039;s something missing??... i can&#039;t put my finger on it, but i wonder if cooks are using new precursors since there&#039;s such a lockdown on the typical ones...anyway, i digress and don&#039;t mean to hijack your vendor thread... <br />Nice review of trip, you tempted me for about 6 seconds and then i realized i already found my favorite...<br /><br />Kush 411<br /><br />Super-clean high - honestly like gliding on glass, haha - yummy bubble-gum taste when smoked if you are a good little tweaker and force yourself to be patient. For you IV- leaguers out there, quickly and completely dissolves in the spoon and rushes like a rocket... in the interest of full disclosure, i have very sensitive skin and i do get a small rash now and again, but Daddy never does so... whatever that tells ya. Oh, after all that, my preferred ROA is straight up the nose - man, i love that burn - instant nasal gratification. Don&#039;t forget to switch sides and never use dollar bills, someone else&#039;s straw, etc, kk? <br /><br />And OMG the fucking stealth. Blows everyone else&#039;s away and after you see it, you would find and shit down the throat of anyone who ever describes it. Sorry, it&#039;s just that goddamn good.<br /><br />AND, cherry on top - this is one slick operation - you&#039;ll get your stuff fast and i think i had one hiccup out of many many (fuck, too many) orders and it was cleaned up and compensated almost faster than i could complain and more than made up for the error. Don&#039;t ask that your hand be held, don&#039;t message before during and after you order forfuqsake, i want them mailing my stuff and not wading through a bunch of superfluous email. Just order it, leave it in escrow just in case and wait for the mail. Easy. Too easy. <br /><br />That&#039;s the way i like it. Uh-huh. ;) <br /><br />--andblue

I really love GHB/1,4B to come down or to add another dimension to the meth high. This combo is the most euphoric orgasmic high that I have ever experienced. I came to SR to find that one special drug or combo of drugs that would send me to pleasuretown and this is it. I&#039;ve tried heroin (little to no euphoria), coke, painkillers, benzos and none of these made me tingle from head to toe like G and meth. <br />

				To continue with the insufflation convo. Its the only ROA I use for potent crystals. The bioavailability is reasonably high to feel worth it, and since I&#039;ve always loved my speed, going on 10 years (sometimes years, weeks, months off. But with SR over the last year usually 1-2months off at most), I worry that I won&#039;t appreciate the &quot;lighter&quot; method of snorting. I too find that the feeling is pleasant, and since meth is potent in nature, the drips are minimal in volume. It&#039;s almost like your nasal cavity immediately detects the shards, excretes a small amount of mucous to dissolve it and neutralize the pain in seconds. (For me, when pain lasts only a few seconds, its quite pleasant, assuming your being sanitary and clean with your actions.<br /><br />I&#039;ll always wonder what IVing and vaping meth would be like, but I don&#039;t feel a strong need to try those methods (If anyone wants to kick harm reduction to the side and encourage me to try either methods, go ahead. You won&#039;t be labelled an asshole by me and I just might do it and write a trip report for it.<br /><br />This week I recveived an order of arigolo&#039;s sped pills from Canada and I was very impressed at how clean the seemedc ompared to other speed pill variants I&#039;ve tried. Customer tests reveled that it was in fact methamphetamine. The pills contain a lot of powder for what I would equate to 60mg of med-high grade CM. But I can quickly rail the entire crushed pill in a few minutes and feel very nice! This is definitely a good economical amphetmaine choice for those who prefer oral/insufflation. I lov this stuff and the pricetag! (A new customer of mine actually introduced me, and although I&#039;m always sketch about pressed pills, these are fucking great and I hope that the supply remains consistent in price and quality.)

				Oh I forgot to actually post my reviews:<br /><br />Kush411: This man is not human. Excellent vendor. His product is always top notch and his shipping... ridiculous stealth. You probably think you have seen stealth shipping but you haven&#039;t until Kush. I swear I thought I got ripped when I opened my first package. lol he sets the bar quite high in that regard. You get what you pay for here. He just came through again for me with an &quot;in transit&quot; to delivery time of what I think was around 30 some hours<br /><br />Hammertime: Great vendor, multiple successful transactions through him. Always good stealth and shipping time, received in 2 days with regular shipping and was packaged with love. My #2 choice after Kush. His gear is good, but seemed to have a slight moistness to it in the most recent batch. I will be checking him out again in the near future though.<br /><br />I have yet to try chaletla or OObaHs but from what I hear they are both excellent. Haven&#039;t actually checked out a listing for OObaH yet but all around good things being heard.<br /><br />Cheers.

But I can quickly rail the entire crushed pill in a few minutes and feel very nice! This is definitely a good economical amphetmaine choice for those who prefer oral/insufflation.

They are worth mentioning for others to give them a chance who may be on the fence. Speed pills are a new product for me (aside from pharamceuticals), and I have heard some negative things about them in general, but I purchased them confidently after Regicide, one of my first customers mentioned them to me. They said that they order many times and the quality was consistent so I was sold, considering the user has some reputable reviews and intelligent posts.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the great product!

				Got a sneaky gram of trip2012&#039;s meth. ;D<br /><br />Very happy overall with the experience: Price was one of, if not the cheapest on SR that will send to Oz at the time of ordering, free worldwide delivery (although it took 21 days through regular post, a little long but I believe stealthier than express/tracked etc). <br />Very good stealth, although double instead of single vac would have been perfect just in case. <br />Won&#039;t go into details but I hope he keeps to his current methods.<br /><br />Now: the most important bit: quality. It&#039;s up there with the best I&#039;ve had so far, although I&#039;m not super-experienced. Not crazy-potent but strong, a nice high and long lasting. <br />It didn&#039;t have a strong or as bitter a taste and wasn&#039;t as painful on the nose when snorted compared to some other gear I&#039;ve had in the past... but I don&#039;t think this is necessarily an indication of purity. <br /><br />Not too bad coming off it, (no problem at all with a xanax) although up until now I usually got by without anything for meth comedown.<br />It arrives crushed as the previous poster mentioned, not in shards, which doesn&#039;t bother me at all as I always crush to a fine powder for snorting anyway and it allows for better stealth. <br />Of course having it pre-crushed means it&#039;s easier for unscrupulous dealers to use cutters, and I haven&#039;t used a test kit but I believe it to be of pretty high purity.<br /><br />He doesn&#039;t have any active listings at the time of posting this, but I messaged him and he said he&#039;d have some back up from Tuesday (16th April). <br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Will definitely be ordering again ASAP. <br /><br />I have only ordered from overseas once before (from MiMM), which didn&#039;t arrive. There were no hassles with getting the refund as stated on his vendor page though, and I knew the possibility was high that our customs/corrupt mail workers would intercept an order, and accepted this risk before I made my order. <br /><br /><br /><br />ps. My preferred ROA is nasal, have tried orally though. Last night I tried &quot;plugging&quot; or rectal administration, but didn&#039;t really like it at all. It has a much higher bio-availability than any other method except for IV, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll do it again. Perhaps it was my fault, I didn&#039;t evacuate my bowels beforehand by means of an enema or taking a crap.

				I am debating whether this thread is pointless or not. I feel like newbies mine as well just wait to post their reviews in the rumor mill. I mean what&#039;s the point of posting it here when you will probably just post it again in the rumor mill. <br /><br />I think this thread should be transformed into a &quot;Help Newbies Choose a Meth Vendor.&quot; A thread where we help newbies find a vendor based on their needs. I will direct everyone to Kush411 and say ditto to whoever reviewed his gear at the start of the thread. He is amazing. <br /><br />Unfortunately he is on vacation but should be back very soon. If he isn&#039;t I would only be able to point you toward a vendor based off other people&#039;s reactions. I tried TopGear on Thursday. He said he was going to ship on Thursday through a PM but it still says processing. If he really did send it Thursday then I should receive it Monday. If he plans on shipping it Monday then I already asked him to cancel the order.

				Quick question:<br /><br />Does heat reduce the potency of meth? I&#039;ve got my bag in a place that gets pretty hot during the day, and I seem to be not getting the effect I did at first...either that, or I&#039;ve built up a tolerance really quickly? I know that a lot of people keep amphetamine sulfate in the fridge, but I couldn&#039;t find any info on meth.<br />I suppose I&#039;ll have to change the place where I keep it.

				angus, how did you store it? and yeah if you don&#039;t store it right it does ruin the ice, cool, dark place.... maybe something like a sealed glass vial/jar in your freezer.. :) never leave it sitting in direct sun or a place that gets hot, ice is hygroscopic hence why the heat in a baggie has ruined your gear.

				I plug it and it doesn&#039;t really give me a rush, but it prevents waste (fucking puns on this topic lol). I usually get an onset between oral and insuflated.. It&#039;s fast, smooth like oral, and comes on quick like snorting. Overall I love this method but it&#039;s not a discreet ROA for all occasions. It lasts long like oral, and you can feel the potency increase beyond the level of oral/insuff.<br /><br />I choose not to smoke/IV simply because dex and amphetamines have been my favourite drug since I was 14 and I like meth just the way it is, and I don&#039;t want to experience any more euphoria than I already get and love from dex and meth.

I keep desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP) around as a part of my medicine cabinet (or pharmacy shelf as I call it.) My second test with it (this stuff is active at 2-5mg, and has a 16 hour halflife so an overdose is gonna be a living hell for a day or two.) So on the tail end of a speed high I decided that Iw ould check if this 2dpmp wold keep elevated dopamine/epinephrine throught the day. Sure enough it worked 2mg was great and the sleep deprived day on a speed burnout was enjoyable and chill as fuck. My highest dose while testing was 30mg in the morning from 6-9am and that was a bit too much, but i wasnt anxious or jittery, not even crashing on it.. sicne u dont crash. Goes great with kratom and benzos lol.

				A Much Needed Thread!<br /><br />New to SR but not new to this product. <br /><br />Vendors Tried So Far: <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Kush411<br />2.&nbsp; Chatella<br />3.&nbsp; Hammertime<br />4.&nbsp; AOD (AmericaOnDrugs)<br />5.&nbsp; Kingcopkilla (Waiting for order)<br /><br />Kush is by far the best Vendor in every respect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Speed of light shipping, excellent stealth and reliable, high quality product.&nbsp; Quality has varied a bit from the various batches (4 orders so far of 3.5 or 7.0), but his product is the most effective with the least amount of cut.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chatella has great stealth, reasonable ship time, but I found the quality of product to be a bit on the weak side.&nbsp; Only ordered one 3.5g, but may be worth another shot if the gear is said to be good at that time.&nbsp; Prices are the most competitive, but as always, you get what you pay for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hammertime has a reputation as an all around great vendor for this product.&nbsp; I ordered 3.5g.&nbsp; from him based on his reputation and when I had a problem with what was sent to me, he corrected the matter immediately.&nbsp; I found this level of professionalism and attention to customer satisfaction impressive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ordered 3.5 gr. from AOD.&nbsp; Had I known how good it was going to be I would have bought an ounce.&nbsp; Have not reviewed them officially yet, but will be getting raves from me on product quality and delivery time.&nbsp; Very fast turn around, almost as fast as Kush.&nbsp; Excellent in terms of potency and very little cut.&nbsp; By far the best quality of all the orders I have placed. Their stealth needs work.&nbsp; I would still order again, but they need a heads up in this department.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take my slight risk in this area to get the same quality of product and based on other peoples&#039; reviews, I think they have been made aware of this issue and will hopefully adjust accordingly. <br /><br />I ordered a 1gr sample from Kingcopkilla and should receive this week.&nbsp; Other members have given them great reviews thus far.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like other members&#039; opinions regarding my philosophy on ordering.&nbsp; I want to minimize my transactions and therefore risk in the shipping process.&nbsp; I was thinking that less shipments would mean less risk all around in terms of exposure.&nbsp; However, this does not take into account the quality of what I will receive.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are never any guarantees, but ordering at least a ball (when possible) before actually trying the product may have been overly optimistic on my part.&nbsp; I placed these orders based on reviews and assumed perhaps naively that the quality I would receive would be similar to that which other members stated they had received.&nbsp; I also assumed that these members actually knew good shit when they had it, and I may have given credit where it was not due.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also assumed and still do that the Vendors on SR are serious business people here to provide a service and make some money.&nbsp; Bad business practices will put a business under quickly in this truly free market, so I chose vendors who had been around awhile and had many good reviews.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have been placing orders based on reviews, but perhaps I should have held back on quantity before actually trying the product myself. From my experience though, batches of product turn over quickly, and what is here today will be gone later today.&nbsp; I would really appreciate more seasoned buyers opinions and advice on this!<br /><br />

				My experience thus far (in chronological order):<br /><br />1. Xinhai --tried xinhai first since I was new getting back on the Road after a long hiatus (of having drugs accessible locally).&nbsp; I live on the East Coast of the US for reference, so almost every meth vendor is going to be across the country entirely.&nbsp; I ordered .25 g from xinhai; the order took a full week to arrive, regular First Class mail.&nbsp; My favourite thing about xinhai is the stealth.&nbsp; FUCKING AMAZING.&nbsp; We couldn&#039;t find it at first, super impressive and entertaining; can even be reused!&nbsp; The product?&nbsp; Can&#039;t complain.&nbsp; Kept me going for a good 2-3 days, not awake the entire time but most of it.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t justify ordering from xinhai again due to the length of time it took to receive it, but product is good and stealth is excellent.<br /><br />2. KingCopKilla --got one of his free samples.&nbsp; The product&#039;s stealth was &#039;eh&#039; but arrived by Priority mail just fine, and very fast!&nbsp; If I recall correctly, shipped on a Monday, arrived Wednesday.&nbsp; Generous sample, probably at least .25 g (didn&#039;t measure it).&nbsp; The product was a bit oily, so snorting was out of the question, but I prefer oral as my RoA for amphetamines, and it did the trick.&nbsp; I must say, it felt tweakier than other stuff I have done, which some people like, but I do not care for.&nbsp; I was going to order some more at one point and he jacked the prices up and basically said &quot;Inflation is a bitch.&quot;&nbsp; So, despite the location being somewhat closer to me, I can&#039;t really justify it, not the most responsive vendor, but not a bad choice if you just want a lot of bang and you want it quickly.<br /><br />3. AmericaOnDrugs --if you look through my history, you will probably think this is a fake account set up by AoD because of how much praise I give this vendor.&nbsp; AoD is fucking fantastic.&nbsp; I would love to buy AoD a drink but we all know that isn&#039;t happening.&nbsp; AoD sent me a customer .5 g sample before they had a listing for it.&nbsp; I was skeptical of their saying it would arrive within three days of shipping due to past experiences and that they ship from the left coast, but AoD delivered and then some.&nbsp; AoD&#039;s stealth is great.&nbsp; Even entertaining, but I&#039;ll leave it at that.&nbsp; I have now ordered from AoD three times and each time has been a joy.&nbsp; AoD&#039;s shipping is included in the price, which is Priority by default but being the doll AoD is, they have thrown in Express for me 2/3 times.&nbsp; The product is consistent and good; shard sizes vary, but I get very small amounts so understandably they get crushed.&nbsp; I do not see any powder in the product, only smaller crystals.&nbsp; Product is smooth and does the trick, I have tried every RoA for it except plugging (not my cup of tea).&nbsp; Works great for snorting; dissolves beautifully for shooting (not my cup of tea but, shit, in the name of science I had to try it!).&nbsp; Orally, it has a nice, euphoric high with no nasty comedown (this is the route I almost always go).&nbsp; Smoking is hard to say since the only apparatus I have to do so is COATED in DMT so I think I&#039;m getting some effects from the DMT res when smoking it; interesting rush, to say the least!<br /><br />So, based on my experience, I can wholeheartedly recommend AmericaOnDrugs as the way to go for speed, stealth, and good product consistency; I know that they have been getting successful shipments to other countries as well if you are not domestic.&nbsp; To be fair, I haven&#039;t ordered from the others multiple times, but you&#039;ll see why I&#039;m sticking with AoD above.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested to read through this review thread and see others&#039; experiences with the various vendors as well.&nbsp; Glad to have found this thread even though my newbie status is coming to a close, and cheers to all!

				I&#039;ve dealt with 3 meth vendors on SR. I have to say that they have all been top notch. One of them is no longer here, but the other two are Hammertime and Xinhai. <br /><br />HT is very good all around. Good quality, good stealth, good communication and free priority shipping, and a good guy. You really can&#039;t go wrong with HT. <br /><br />Xinhai is the other. I haven&#039;t had any need to directly communicate with him/her so I can&#039;t comment on that. The shipping is 1st class, not priority, but stealth is amazing. I would call it &quot;prison level stealth&quot;. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he had experience shipping drugs into prisons. Trust me, I know about getting drugs into prison. <br /><br />So, if you are having it shipped to your house, and you live with nosy people who might decide to open your mail. go with Xinhai and take the hit on the extra day for delivery. Otherwise, HT has never let me down. Either way, they are both quality vendors.

				Hammertime has way better stuff than Chaletla and he/she is professional.&nbsp; Chaletla has turned into a big fuck up.&nbsp; He is pushing shit now and not getting orders out.&nbsp; You can bet he will be busted soon - sending out hundreds of packages from the same post office.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try AmericaOnDrugs and DankHerbalIncense - they are very competitive in price now with Chaletla&#039;s shit and it is good.&nbsp; Hammertime is good stuff too - a little more pricey, but consistent and damn professional.&nbsp;

				I am posting this across every thread relating to meth vendors particularly to Chaletla<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole story with my order:<br />Order marked in transit day after. I wait one week checking the mail, and nothing. I start sending messages to track it. I get a reply that it&#039;s going to be sent tomorrow (that&#039;s 9 days after marked in transit!). I gave the benefit of the doubt. Three days later I receive a bag of stuff that looks like ketamine tiny shards. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER FINALIZE UPON RECEIPT. I smoked it and I guess if you&#039;re an idiot from a state like mine that doesn&#039;t know too much about tina maybe someone might&#039;ve thought &quot;thats what crystal must be like.&quot; So I reply that I better get the real stuff and I want it express for the utterly obnoxious wait time. Two days later I receive a package of 60% big ass beautiful shards. Awesome product. The other 40% was that same crap. But like a dummy I saw those gigantic beautiful shards and hit the finalize button. As a seller on the streets I figured I have a lot of people who just sniff so I&#039;ll give them that. Two of those people felt sick for two days. Personally after I accidentally mixed some with the big shards to smoke-test it, later in the day my hands, mouth, forehead, and forearms became pockmarked. I have no idea why this seller chose to fuck with me specifically given his amazing reviews and honestly a 5/5 level product. However I seen forum postings about people with less than 5 transactions getting this fake shit. So if you have less than five be REAL WEARY of this guys shit. So, Chaletla, I hope all the people with low stats that buy from you and never tried tina or just not too good with understanding what REAL meth is wake the fuck up and don&#039;t fall for your &quot;meth.&quot; If you want me to make this a 5/5 review, (and your product was 5/5) then send real shit and not in a ratio of real to fake. JUST REAL<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Vendor got the message that I was one upset customer. He offered to resend the package, +weight, and express. The package arrived on time and was perhaps the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. GIGANTIC shards and beyond superb quality. My only advice to newbies or buyers with low stats is to message him before buying it and making sure that everything will be on point. Let him know you have heard about it happening to others and will not stand for it if it happens to you. <br /><br />Vendor told me that his packaging person was fired solely because of how I was treated as a customer. Chaletla takes customer satisfaction very seriously and I admire the tremendous effort he undertook to make my transaction satisfactory to me.

				Have ordered from Kush in the past and that experience has been phenomenal; unfortunately he&#039;s still on vacation. Couldn&#039;t wait, so I diversified and ordered from Three and hammertime. Looking forward to reviewing the goods.

				I have to say to the guy above - WTF ?&nbsp; &nbsp;He sent your order out 9 days after being marked &quot;in transit&quot;, he tried to rip you off by sending you 60 % legit product and 40 % crap.&nbsp; You had to fight to get him to make it right.&nbsp; He tells you the bullshit &quot;it&#039;s not my fault&quot; story about a packager that he fired and then he sends you compensation.&nbsp; So he did what he was supposed to ( at what I can only guess was 3,4,5 weeks after you placed the order ) and now he is praised for taking customer service seriously ?&nbsp; &nbsp; No disrespect to you, but I think you give him too much credit.&nbsp; Too many people have had the same experience - in July 2013 and June and May and April and March and Feb and Jan.&nbsp; There is a consistent, pervasive pattern of orders shipped late, orders not shipped at all, orders being filled with bunk, orders going out in packaging that may as well be bright pink and marked &quot;there&#039;s something very curious and odd in me&quot;.&nbsp; If only 2 out of 10 customers that are chosen to be dupes raise a fuss about their order and they are compensated - the vendor is still ahead by taking advantage of the other 8.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the vendors in a category on SR share the same pool of customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;When newbies have a bad experience with one they are apt to assume that it is the norm and never come back to SR.&nbsp; A lot of people end up paying the price for one vendor&#039;s greed, dishonesty and deceit.&nbsp; SR won&#039;t be around forever - and it will be a sloppy, careless vendor who is in it for himself and has a &quot;fuck the community&quot; mentality that will bring the whole thing down.&nbsp;
