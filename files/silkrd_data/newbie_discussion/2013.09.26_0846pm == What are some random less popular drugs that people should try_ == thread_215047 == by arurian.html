				I have to say that 4-ACO-DMT is my fave at the moment of the lesser known drugs out there.<br /><br />I find it incredibly similar to doing mushrooms with a significant decrease in nausea. <br /><br />check this link <br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-Acetylpsilocin

				I&#039;m gonna have some spare BTC after I make an order tonight, so I&#039;m wondering what something I should order is. Preferably something hard to find on the street.<br />I&#039;ve done (in order of my favorite to least favorite) LSD, MDMA, 2CI, weed, Vicodin, 25i, alcohol, cigarettes, xanax, and focalin so far, with focalin being the only thing I don&#039;t like (because of the crash).<br />I am going to try shrooms but those are easy to find on the street so I&#039;m not going to order them. I&#039;m going to try DMT soon but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m going to order it this time around. <br />Based on the above, what should I get? I want to try something new.

				Kratom is so nasty.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking to get high, you won&#039;t find it there.&nbsp; If you like opiates but want something light then go for it.
