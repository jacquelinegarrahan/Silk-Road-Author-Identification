				The most annoying part is that I&#039;m unable to respond to threads I started. To make matters worse, in one of the threads I started someone misinterpreted something I said as being an insult. Ordinarily I would post a response and let them know it wasn&#039;t intended to be an insult but now I can&#039;t. Honestly, in the very least I feel newbies should have access to the &quot;Drug Safety&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; forums.

But i can no longer reply !<br /><br />how does this work ? can you register and make one post and then automaticly get sent to whatever limbo thiz newbiezone is ? Or was someone insulted by my post yesterday and this is a punishment ? If it is, point taken how do i get out ? i need to leave reviews this is some good product i got and the seller deserves praise. Am i here a set time or how does this thing work ?<br /><br />This was the only tread here that made sence there where only 2 treads one about pgp and then endless identical spam treads, i am seriously confused here why is there no FAQ informing me about what type of coold and confusing twilight zone i have ended up in here ????

Who knows. Most people here may be new to SR and the forums but they are probably not new to buying the stuff that is sold. Which means that they could still post some really usefull info, for example in the forums about drug use. *sigh*

				I&#039;m not a newbie, but I am still relatively new. I didn&#039;t use the forum much, mostly to post reviews of vendors I&#039;ve used and answered questions where I truly had something to offer to someone. I would rather not use it to this extent, but if I have to, to help other people and leave reviews, I&#039;m going to. That&#039;s what this forum was made for and it works...when the people who need to post CAN post.

				I created my SR account in September 2012 and my SR forum account in August 2012. With the exception of a few vendor reviews, I rarely post. It&#039;s pretty disappointing that I am forced into the &quot;Newbie discussion&quot; just so I can give my vendors the reviews they deserve.
