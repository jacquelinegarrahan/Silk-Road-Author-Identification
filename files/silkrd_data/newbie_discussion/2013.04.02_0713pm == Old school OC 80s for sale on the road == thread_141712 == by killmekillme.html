				Haven&#039;t seen old school Oxys for a *long* time. I&#039;ve got a friend who&#039;s got a small stash of 40&#039;s who will very occasionally toss one my way.<br /><br />I miss those fuckers.

				Purdue pharma is the manufacturer of Oxycontin. It&#039;s been over 2 years since they switched from &quot;OC&quot; to &quot;OP&quot;. Purdue hasn&#039;t manufactured them in a long time, so anything you find is likely to be fake our counterfeit. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s impossible, but they odds are staked against you. The original OC&#039;s were just pure Oxycodone with a time release seal coated around the pill. If your looking for pure Oxycodone, just go with the &quot;Roxi&quot;. There are lots of Oxycodone&#039;s on the market. Oxycontin was nothing more than a brand name.

I wonder if they are old OC 80s or newer ones from the EU.

				Cheaper IRL as far as I&#039;m concerned. <br /><br />What i do know is that if a legit vendor actually stepped up to the plate<br />and had the real deal, unlimited supply, and sold em at like 50 cent per milligram, he&#039;d make a killing.<br /><br />people with scripts cant even keep them in stock here ahah.<br /><br /><br />

				OC stands for &quot;OxyContin&quot;. Oxycontin is Purdue pharmas brand name for their old time released Oxycodone tablet. &quot;OXY&quot; for the ingredient oxycodone, and &quot;CONTIN&quot; for continual release. Purdue pharma was pressured hard by lawsuits and the DEA to change their formula as it became the most abused pharmaceutical on the market. Since then Purdue has discontinued the OC and replaced it with OP. The OP is a tablet that mixed the oxycodone with a type of gel, instead of just wrapping a sealant around a tablet of pure oxycodone that could easily be removed. There was nothing special about the old OC&#039;s. Any generic oxycodone tab contains the exact same ingredient that the old OC did. As for finding OC&#039;s on the market today, I&#039;m not saying it can&#039;t be done, just that I would be weary of them. Maybe someone is producing good knock offs, maybe someone has bulk supplies of old tabs, who knows. Just realize that OC was just a brand name. Nothing magical or special about them.

				CRWHITLOCK, I appreciate you trying to educate me, but I assure you I know that oxycontin is nothing more than a brand name for the semi-synthetic opioid oxycodone. And to correct you, the &quot;coating&quot; has nothing to do with the time release mechanism for pills. I&#039;m quite sure that the old school formulation is still made in the EU and if you look on SR you will see that is one of the best deals that can be had for oxycodone

				The original OC&#039;s did have a time release coating around them.. The new OP&#039;s do not. I wasn&#039;t trying to insult you man, just commenting, apologize if I offended you. Like I said there are still OC&#039;s out there, but they aren&#039;t coming from Purdue. My only point was that a lot of people &quot;not you&quot; seem to think there was something special about the old OC&#039;s. I was simply stating that if you buy a 30mg oxycodone tab you essentially have one of the old OC&#039;s minus the coating.

				The coating had nothing to do with the time release mechanism of the pill. It was just a color to help pharmacists easily distinguish the different strengths of OC. If you removed only the coating and popped the pill it would not be IR.

				I&#039;m not saying your wrong, I was just unaware of that. If it wasn&#039;t the coating, what was the time release mechanism? It seemed that once the coating was removed you had pure oxycodone on your hands. It must have been how tight the ingredients were pressed?&nbsp; Please share.

				The time release mechanism is a patented trade secret that has to do with the binders in the pill. The colored coating has nothing to do with this. Use common sense--the coating comes off easily with a damp paper towel. How would that water soluble coating prevent your stomach acid from digesting the pill like an IR pill?<br /><br />The coating of a pill is generally there to protect the inner pill, extend the shelf life of the pill, and make the pill easier to swallow or to disguise a nasty taste.<br /><br />
