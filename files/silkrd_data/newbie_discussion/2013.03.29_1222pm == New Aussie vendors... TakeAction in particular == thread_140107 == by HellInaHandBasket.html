				So OI haven&#039;t been trolling the listings as much these last few weeks.. long story but basically the absence of a few of the vendors I had become attached to upsets me and the thought of what might have befallen them is just too much... Shardy Pa is thinking of ya.. hope your free and easy kicking goals all over the place and Stops wtf happened to ya.. ??? <br /><br />anyhow so tonight I thought I&#039;d see whats new and catch up a bit... What a frustrating and annoying and embarrassing time it turned into.. Now I am usually not one to comment on the price point for the illicit drugs here in Au due to the population size, our geographic location and the risk of being caught and all the pain that follows along with it, but I really have to comment on these new clowns that have popped up and the prices they are charging for a product that is not 2 times as good (some are 3 times normal price.. our normal too which is about 1.5 times normal) and ... fucking and these lazy dumb assholes cannot even be bothered with PGP!!! so the premium price buys you average product (not bad average but as normal average) and sub par security...<br /><br />TakeAcction caught my eye as one who should be banned from vending before they&nbsp; a) undermine the integrity of SR and b) get busted for importing gear (clearly stuff they have just ordered themselves and then listed for the fucking atrocious price they have)<br /><br />In example; .5g of meth (looks like a well known vendors stuff from the picture) is $528.50...<br />the other listing for this joke of wanna be dealer, greedy son of a bitch, I&#039;ll just copy as is below;<br /><br />1 gram high purity high price ,,<br />$834.50<br /><br />14 Grams of { JEDI DEATH STAR } 43 % THC LEVEL<br />$477.00<br /><br />28 Grams of { JEDI DEATH STAR } 43 % THC LEVEL<br />$630.50<br /><br /><br />630 for a Oz! almost 850 for a g of meth... And for fucks sake the &#039;High purity High price&#039; title is just a slap in the face IMO. <br /><br />AND no PGP!!!! They are not alone with AussieUnderground and aussiepillz both being too lazy or arrogant to have a PGP block for orders... I had to stop browsing the listings because I am just beside myself with anger right now..<br /><br />I hope you read this you 3... Shame on you and if you have a shred of intelligence I suggest getting your house in order ASAP.. and Take Action... well if I could I would take action on you the way we used to deal with little poser kids... as it is this is all I can do.. for now anyway... a few more posts and there will be some posts in the rumor mil about you. <br /><br />Pull your fucking head in and stop being such a greedy, arrogant little fuckwit.. your vendor blurb reads like you think you are some kind of OG but to those of us who can read between the lines , we know your some dumb little kid with a shelf life that&#039;s running out very quickly.. <br /><br />The buyers that have purchased from these guys must have rocks in their heads so .. whatever... they get done and you get caught up in you have no one to blame but yourself..<br /><br />

				Two thoughts I am having reading my rant now...<br /><br />1. Maybe I need to have a day or 3 off the gear and offline cause thats not how I usually roll<br /><br />2. I stand by the premise for the post and the points I have made but still feel like , although I can&#039;t really see it this second, i&#039;ll feel bad for being so vocal with my opinions when I am in the light of a new day...<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong... I&#039;m not tweaking out or anything.. slept, ate and hydrated etc but for some reason while reading it just now I got that &#039;hmm scathing and true but maybe a little too much anger for something that really doesn&#039;t have to affect you&#039; feeling..<br /><br />&lt;---- this guy is logging off and says g&#039;night to all you lovely SR soldiers...<br /><br />1 post left I think and I do believe no spam in any of the ones so far!<br /><br />EDIT: I felt the neg karma as it was being given to me but didn&#039;t know it till after this post! lol. deserved and understood anonymous karma giver.. night all

				What the fuck?! SERIOUSLY? get the fuck out of here. Even the best of the domestic market of aren&#039;t that greedy.<br /><br />Note to all you Aussie vendors (present and prospective) rethink your strategy all together. Considering we all have access to the same warez but the cost of the risk associated with charging exorbitant prices is just unsustainable. I understand that there&#039;s profit to be made but aim long term cos you aint making shit profit in the short term.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to sell at that price, do it on the street, at least those customers will be used to the pricing model. You gougers will not get far on this road at all. Competition and fair dinkum vendors will make sure of that. Believe that

				Take OZConnection(92) for example. I leave him a less than glowing review with 2/5 because the stupid cunt advertisers it as 90%+ pure. Just another local cunt who thinks he can sell for what he wants. His 0.1&#039;s have magically dropped from around $100 to $65. Total&nbsp; loser.

				Buyers stop need to being such pussies. If the gear you ordered is not to par, then rate them so! Stop giving vendors 5/5 just because it got to your mail box, that&#039;s bullshit. Rate them according to the product they sell.<br /><br />I am looking forward to getting to 50 posts so I can tell certain vendors what I really think - ESPECIALLY those who make you finalise early.

Buyers should be searching the forums to find out if a vendor is trustworthy, and not rely on the feedback system.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17871.0<br /><br />This isn&#039;t Ebay or Amazon and you seem to have unrealistic expectations. From the sounds of it you didnt bother PMing OZconnection with your issues and instead just left a very damaging negative review.&nbsp; IMO you will run out of local buyers pretty soon with that attitude.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off all, this buyer ha zero transactions so there was absolutely nothing to research. And after my less than glowing review he removed the listing, then re listed without the 90% pure bullshit. He also did this for all his other coke listings.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read that link but will soon. It&#039;s fair enough that some sellers require FE, but it&#039;s not fair on buyers at all. It needs to change.<br /><br />I don&#039;t particularly care about local buyers anymore, I am am more than happy to risk it with overseas purchases and customs.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that the feedback system could be much better, I don&#039;t think there would be too many people that disagree with that.

				He just flat out lied to me. Why else would he titles of all his listings change so soon after? His message to me after I asked him why his price had suddenly dropped and the title had changed:<br /><br />&quot;no this is a different weaker batch, im sorry you feel ripped off, but everything i said was true about it. we can agree to disagree. other people seemed to enjoy it.&quot;<br /><br />No. Absolute bullshit. If it wasn&#039;t for me, people would still be buying his &quot;90% pure<br /><br />100mg of 90% would have blown my head off.<br /><br />I read that entire thread about the current feedback system and the conclusion I draw from it is that it does not work!
