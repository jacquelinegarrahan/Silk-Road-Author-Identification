				yesterday i tried to log in my account and could not. It said password incorrect, even if i used same as always. Today i tried again and i logged in....to find that all my funds (about 0,6-1 bitcoin) had disapeared. I found only 0,01 bitcoin. I did not answer to phishing mails, i logged in always in same ip address, i told noone my password, so i did not know how this could happen.&nbsp; Only thing i did is giving negative feedback to Frank Mathews go gave me some fake mdma. Maybe his revenge? i don&#039;t know what to think.&nbsp;

				Most likely you have been a victim of a phishing attack if you accessed the Silkroad through a wiki instead of keeping your own address written down or remembered. Also, withdrawing your balance after having gotten in is impossible unless you also have the PIN of the user. If you were required to enter your PIN on the login page, then you were on the wrong onion address.

				I really doubt it had anything to do with frank m.&nbsp; He&#039;s in the top 1% of vendors and while I&#039;m not saying that means he does no wrong but with the cash flow going though his account I doubt he would waste any time hacking your account for that little amount. Some days I see he has like a few orders every hour like all day. Chances are you got scammed instead of hacked
