				So I got the little flashing caution sign as well as the TOR splash page message that a security update is ready to be installed.&nbsp; However, it takes me to a page where I basically have to install the whole thing over again, and when I tried that I lost all my bookmarks.&nbsp; So I basically deleted that install and just use the old one for now.<br /><br />Is there a way to install TOR updates without losing your bookmarks? (forum links, favorite threads, favorite vendors, etc.)

				I backup my bookmarks to a file.&nbsp; Click Bookmarks - Show All Bookmarks - then click the star icon to backup, it backs up to a .json file.&nbsp; Save that somewhere, then from the new Tor do the same thing except click Import.&nbsp; It will overwrite everything that&#039;s already there, but if its a fresh install that would be nothing.<br /><br />The first time I upgraded Tor I lost all my bookmarks too.&nbsp; It was kind of a hassle getting everything organized again.

				Thanks for the info, I&#039;ll give it a try.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there must be some reason that routine TOR updates would overwrite all bookmarks.

				How are you guys updating TOR?&nbsp; Using TOR itself? <br /><br />There is no need and it is faster (well it is with me, I have fiber optic cable broadband) to just download the TOR browser bundle using a clearnet browser&nbsp; &nbsp;and then, since it is a self-extracting file, to extract it to your existing location, say TOR on your USB stick. Then you answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the &quot;Replace all files&quot; question and you will find that all your old bookmarks are still there.<br /><br />Works for me, if you have any problems it could be one of your configuration settings is wrong, so let me know if you can&#039;t figure it out yourself.<br />Saves all that copying HTML files or json files if you use TOR itself and you might find (like I did) that it did not restore them properly, there were duplicate folders etc.<br />Hope this helps :)<br />

				I&#039;ve been having the same dilemma. There is no link just to download the security update, so I downloaded the whole thing again too. Problem is, it won&#039;t let me overwrite my old Tor bundle with the new one, so i&#039;m just using the old one too, warning sign flashing.

				The update is the entire self-extracting package again. Just extract to the same location and nothing else will change other than running the update. don&#039;t use the old one too long before updating.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178611.msg1295255#msg1295255">Quote from: Garrincha on July 01, 2013, 05:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve been having the same dilemma.
