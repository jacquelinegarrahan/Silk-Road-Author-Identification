				Obviously when dealing with drugs etc it&#039;s best to leave no trace. However, what if someone shoot&#039;s you a text... &quot;hey man, let&#039;s move this O I got in yesterday.&quot; Is that enough for the cops to get a search warrant and storm your house?

				If you let the police see a text message indicating intent to distribute narcotics, prepare your anus.<br /><br />Seriously though, unless you show the cop the text, or are already under investigation, you&#039;ll be ok. Still, I wouldn&#039;t rely on text if I were you.

No. Absolutely not. They need to establish probable cause in order to obtain a warrant. If you were stopped in your car, then they would at least need reasonable suspicion to get you out of your car and do a plain sight search. If that&#039;s the case they can also do a frisk, or &quot;Terry pat down&quot; which is less invasive than anything the TSA Nazis engage in. But they&#039;d need a warrant to open your trunk, your glove compartment and any closed or zipped up bags you refuse to let them search anything.<br /><br />Please learn to exercise your rights. It&#039;s the only way you&#039;ll survive- and that includes living your life perfectly LEGALLY.

				VERY fucking effectively. Especially if you live in the US. Many American providers will cough them up without a warrant (similar to Yahoo, Google, etc. for e-mail). That&#039;s why there are stupid simple apps like TextSecure on Android which encrypts texts end-to-end, with no chance of someone knowing what you&#039;re talking about. That includes if they seize your respective phones. Of course, you&#039;d better have a long enough and complicated enough passphrase on it, or it could be cracked by LE.<br /><br />One more thing: if LE attempts to build a case against you using bullshit evidence that wasn&#039;t properly acquired, it can be thrown out if you have a lawyer who&#039;s the least bit competent. But they can keep tabs on you illegally to build a case against you LEGALLY. That means always watch your back. ALWAYS. You can&#039;t be too cautious or too paranoid.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155185.msg1083138#msg1083138">Quote from: neuromancer on May 03, 2013, 05:50 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How effectively can law enforcement tap into SMS transmissions?
