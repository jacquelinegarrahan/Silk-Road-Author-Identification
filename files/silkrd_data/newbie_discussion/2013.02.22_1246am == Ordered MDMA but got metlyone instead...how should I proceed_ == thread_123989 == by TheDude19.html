				Hello all, as I try to rack up 50 posts I might as well solve a problem I just encountered. Say that I ordered some MDMA from a very reputable seller on SR and it arrives in a timely fashion, however when it&#039;s tested with a reagent test it comes up as Methlyone.<br /><br />I just send the seller a message and am not trying to leave negative feedback just yet, I just would like to know the proper protocols I must go through first. <br /><br />Thanks!

				Give seller enough time to respond. If you already finalized then hope seller is good and opens a coversation with you to resolve. If you havent finalized dont finalize yet, contact seller give him atleast a week to respond id say... if no response use SR&#039;s resolve option. If you want to give him more time and auto-finalize is coming up you can extend the auto-finalize time too if you want. Basically just try to resolve it with the seller first.

				Refund or no refund, you should post up the seller and item no# on here so that other users can see, and refer to your test results in your review.<br /><br />Sorry, but playing the ol&#039; switcheroo isn&#039;t funny...

				Not a very classy thing to do but should atleast give the vendor a benefit of the doubt and contact him.&nbsp; Aside from that, letting everyone else know who it came from would be nice so we can avoid until a solution has been found.

				Hm, can we know who the seller is? I ordered some MDMA recently and would like to know if mine might be compromised too.
