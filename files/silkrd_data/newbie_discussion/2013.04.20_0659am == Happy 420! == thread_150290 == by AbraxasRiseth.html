				Hope everyone will have a nice 420! I unfortunately don&#039;t have any weed so the best I can hope for is going over to a friends house later today and smoking with them. But if you have some, have fun and take a hit for me! Any special plans? I actually had two different plans cancelled. Hope everyone is having better luck then me.

				I tried to plan for 420 by ordering last Sunday domestic and its still not here. Vendor said Friday or Saturday to me in messages but I saw them tell another buyer in their forum review that the way that they shipped doesnt deliver on Saturdays anymore leading me to wonder. <br />Want to hear where I messed up? FE for a bonus worth $2.00 and free shipping. They dont tell you HOW the free shipping is sent. Its not going to be what everyone else does which is priority. Oh yeah and no tracking number for it. <br />Boy am I setup for a selective scam! I am a newbie on this forum but not a newbie to shipping and definitely not the online game. <br />Although I should say the vendor does have good feedback and I still have faith in them coming through.<br />The bottom line is I should have asked more questions if I needed it here by 4/20 and maybe I shouldnt have FE. Thought I would put this out there just as a warning to others to learn from.

				Shhhiiii.... didn&#039;t think of that. But by now it&#039;s 420 in all of the continental states so I&#039;m good. I just discovered I had resin so I made a sizable resin bowl and I&#039;m feeling pretty good lol.

I&#039;m fucking cursed. Ever since I&#039;ve started smoking weed,&nbsp; I&#039;ve never smoked on 420! I never have some or don&#039;t have friends who have some. This is the first time I have friends who smoke regularly so I&#039;m practically praying they smoke me out today. Whenever I get a job I&#039;ll definitely be buying some. It just really sucks hearing about people blazing it up today and it seems like everyone in the world has some but me.&nbsp; :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;(

				&nbsp;8) HAPPY 420 Eveyrone!!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />What a great day! Hit the bong, crank up a song, all night long!<br /><br />With SR shittin the bed at the worst possible time, not to mention the lack of sales, the only thing<br />left is to take a toke, not to choke... Last year was dam cool, there were tons of sales, I think I got<br />close to 10 orders for about $150 total! It&#039;s a dam shame today, but there is always next year!<br /><br />Hopefully the site will get fixed up, you would think it would have been addressed hours ago, but<br />the guys must be in the DC hittin&#039; the peace pipe...lol!<br /><br />Stay safe, and see ya on the dark side of the moon!<br /><br />
