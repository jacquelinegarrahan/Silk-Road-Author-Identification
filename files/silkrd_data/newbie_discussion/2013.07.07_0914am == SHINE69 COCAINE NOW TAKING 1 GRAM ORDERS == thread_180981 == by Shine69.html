				Hi shine69, at 60% purity for that price i would&#039;nt think twice about buying an 8ball but as your a new seller i will wait a while for your stats to improve a bit.<br />I wish you all the luck as we need a UK seller whos not charging the earth for much needed good quality cocaine at affordable prices.<br />As someone has mentioned before it would be great to get your Eztest results validated by pineapple for purity etc as this would be a benchmark <br />for your current batch and give the buyers peace of mind in trusting and buying your product.<br />If the results do come back at 60% at these prices then you will be a TOP seller on SR.<br />I would recommend selling some more paid samples such as 0.2mg just to get a feedback bases going.<br /><br />All the best GS :o

				Shine69, I forgot to mention that you will need to get a pgp key as people wont trust buying large/many orders from you without one,especially as you are a new vendor.<br />I dont think its too hard to get one and will be well worth getting one for more business&nbsp; :)<br /><br />GB :o

				Hi GS,<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; ...will definitely contact pineapple now about doing some tests to confirm purity. Regarding the pgp key....How do I go about setting that up? as a few people have mentioned it...if anyone has any advice on the issue please pm me...thanks&nbsp;
