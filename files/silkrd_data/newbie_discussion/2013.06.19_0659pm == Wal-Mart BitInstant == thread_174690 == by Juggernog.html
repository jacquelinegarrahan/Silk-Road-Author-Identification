				So I go into a pretty small wal-mart 2 weeks ago to make my bitinstant payment, and the lady who was helping me asked what is this ZipZap for?<br />I came up with some bill payment story, she goes to tell me she has 2 people that come in once a week and send 400-500.00 a week.. SAME PEOPLE SAME PLACE... I don&#039;t think she cared much she was going against wal-mart regulation in sharing this information with me, but I just think it&#039;s crazy that even in the small towns there are big BTC purchasers, and if they are going through 400-500 a week you know they are re-sale for SR. lol <br /><br />People, if you use bitinstant for SR, (if possible) use different deposit locations and wallets each time<br /><br />Just random to help to 50 posts.. anyone else have a similar story?

				I&#039;ve heard of such, but she&#039;s just some random nosey walmart employee.&nbsp; ZipZap and bitcoin are both legitimate things. I also would tell her straight up, I&#039;m buying bitcoin for the purpose of investment and then just go somewhere else. (Any other moneygrams in your area? Walmart is only one of a few).

				Well, I have yet to go back to that wal-mart.. I have to drive a bit further now, but no big.<br />I don&#039;t tell people around here about bitcoin. from the 4 people I HAVE heard talking about it, it was basically &quot;bitcoin is for the black-market&quot; that&#039;s it.. The media really fucks peoples brains out. In a small community It&#039;s worse too, because 50% will have a media source, then butcher it and spread it to the remaining 50% that have not yet heard... lol<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendations though.

				None of her freakin business. Complain to her boss, tell him she asked about a service that is used for people with bad credit, or something like that. Say it embarrassed you , compare it to asking a customer what she&#039;s buying vagisal or a douchebag for , and embarrassingly stinky twat. Like someone mentioned above, none of that is illegal and you don&#039;t havta mention bitcoins either. They&#039;ve asked me that Q B4 too., I just say I&#039;m paying a bill. If ya got a cvs nearby, try using the red batphone for moneygram, works pretty good.

				88fxstc, Agreed. Hence why I didn&#039;t feel compelled to actually tell her it was for bitcoins, I just came up with a bill-pay excuse (even though NO excuse is necessary)<br />good point about turning it around, and making her feel like a dirty whore.. lol Maybe if I get confronted again, I will apply some social-engineering.<br /><br />good stuff.

				I haven&#039;t reupped on btc recently but I used to use mtgox. Looking at bitinstant it looks like a dream come true. Is it really that simple?<br /><br />I just print out the zip zap from their website, to to a moneygram and pay it in cash, and that&#039;s it? That&#039;s freaking amazing! Thats way more secure than anything I&#039;ve ever used before. I used to use Dwolla and MtGox and not only is this more secure, it&#039;s way easier.

				I must admit that even though they are a bit pricey, I have several times used BitInstant/ZipZap, purching BTC with Walmart MG, and I&#039;ve actually had no problems with the customer service people in the Walmart I go to, ever.&nbsp; I do just as a matter of course in all BTC deposits, use a different wallet address each time, but other than that, I&#039;ve been sending money grams to various people, countries, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;for several years (last two I&#039;ve lived in the same place and used the same Walmart - so even if they don&#039;t know me by name, they recognize me and are always friendly and helpful... something I don&#039;t generally say about Walmart employees in general.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, that&#039;s besides the point.<br /><br />Matter of fact, I just purchased some last evening from WalMart and for the first time, there was a problem with the transaction going through.&nbsp; It was giving an error message that my last name was &quot;wrong&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, the lady was very helpful and as she saw that I had a smartphone in my hand, suggested that I double check my account with them to see if they had made a mistake in the spelling.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did just that and sure enough, they had transposed two letters.&nbsp; &nbsp;The customer service lady then entered in the misspelled name that was on my account page and it went through just fine.<br /><br />On another note, I once went to a Cash America... and that woman was nosy as shit, looked at me like I was surely gonna be trouble....&nbsp; &nbsp;then when she informed me that my transaction looked suspiciously as if I was attempting to buy that &quot;subversive&quot; and illegal digital currency, I informed her that I was indeed going to purchase some BitCoin which is a perfectly legal digigal currency that can be used online to purchase everything from vaccum cleaners to kids toys, but I had changed my mind about to whom I would give my business due to her attitude and turned around and left....&nbsp;

				There is nothing inherently illegal about Bitcoin. I am always upfront when making fiat transfers about the Bitcoin conversion. I just say it is for investment purposes. The more people purchasing Bitcoin the better.
