				Um good luck with that. I dont buy bulk anything but I know in reading alot of the vendor policies who sell bulk like you are looking for require FE. Especially for a noob.<br />Most probably won&#039;t sell you that as a new buyer FE or not..

It means that you send the payment to the seller before they ship/before you receive your package. It is generally frowned upon because buyers can get scammed (unless you have a very trustworthy vendor), when you FE you are out of SR&#039;s escrow system

				The point in FE is to protect the vendor.<br /><br />Someone would be out of their fucking mind to send a new a buyer a 5 pack without FE.<br /><br />If you&#039;re scared of losing the package, purchase in smaller quantities with more transactions.&nbsp; (spread out the risk)<br /><br />Other than that, I would say you&#039;re trying to scam a vendor.

				only fe when you have a trusted vendor otherwise you can get scammend.<br />i think bulk orders are very risky..i dont think they sent it as one package.a friend of mine orderd 128g weed a long time ago and it cames in 5 packages and with 3-5 days between arriving.<br />i only buy small orders from something thats can be found easly like weed pills and so on.<br />the only thing i order bulk is lsd but when it cames from another country i really scarred about the question :<br />WILL IT ARRIVE?<br />when you really wanna do a bulk order search a trusted vendor in your country otherwise its to risky.<br />im waiting for my blotters from nl and really hope they will made it otherwise my festival gonna be lame.....<br />good luck that you find some vendor <br />greets mushroomie

				i understand that there are people out there who live to scam, but you cannot over look at the fact that some people actually mean business!!! If anyone can refer me to someone, or venders reading this, simply message me! there are plenty on SR but they require FE or have mids, now nobody wants &quot;MIDS&quot; lol

				I really hope you aren&#039;t planning on sending that much on such a frequent basis to just one address. I would definitely try and spread it out between a few different addresses and spread out the risk.

				If you don&#039;t have stats, then no. No legit seller will do that probably, and ones that will might be scammers. I mean there&#039;s honestly not that high of profit margins in weed unless you grow the stuff yourself, and even then you only get a few oz&#039;s a plant... <br /><br />I would start small (oz or less listings), then when you have a few sales under your belt you can go big. I was a buyer for a year, deleted my old account, and hard to start over as a buyer a few months ago... It&#039;s a process for everyone&#039;s safety. Read vendor reviews, and you&#039;ll be fine.
