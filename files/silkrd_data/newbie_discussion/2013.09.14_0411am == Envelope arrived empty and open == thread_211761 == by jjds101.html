				Had an express package large envelope delivered this week that arrived open with no contents inside.&nbsp; The pull-tab wasn&#039;t ripped open on it, it looks like it just came unglued.&nbsp; Like maybe the item was bigger than the envelope could handle and the seal came undone.&nbsp; About halfway undone at least.&nbsp; Was somewhat bent and mangled as well.&nbsp; Then whatever it was either fell out in transit or was stolen.&nbsp; Or intercepted and I&#039;m being watched now.<br /><br />Not sure what to think or do.&nbsp; It seems unlikely that if LE got hold of it they&#039;d deliver an empty &amp; open envelope.&nbsp; &nbsp;Contacted the vendor who hasn&#039;t responded yet; looks like initial message was read 24-hours ago.&nbsp; Vendor has always been solid for me in the past though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any thoughts?

				From my experience, it probably isn&#039;t going to show.<br /><br />I would think USPS stole the contents. This seems to be a common occurance. The government always steals from us. You&#039;re right though, I don&#039;t think LE got the package so you atleast don&#039;t have to worry about that. Hopefully it wasn&#039;t your mail carrier or now he knows what you&#039;re up to..

				i&#039;d say you really need to find an alternative addy to have stuff sent to for a few months at least. just to be on the safe side.<br /><br /><br />.

				Sounds like the contents could of been taken out before it was shipped by a worker in the PO. I would use a different address and hope that they didn&#039;t catch on to you and know you were getting stuff so they decided to take it for themselves somehow, just a theory

				The seller probably won&#039;t give anything for free, not much to do apart from stop using the address. The contents will be in a lock up or someones stash.

				it probably broke open in transit and the contents fell out. shoot the vendor a message and see if there is anything that can be done about this. reputable vendors will make it right or at least give a partial refund.

				Still no response from vendor.&nbsp; I guess the best move is to take it to resolve in a few days when eligible and see if he&#039;s willing to reship some portion of the order (priority not express to a different addy) ?&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to be difficult or anything, if that&#039;s the occasional cost of doing business, so be it.&nbsp; <br /><br />But i would guess it could have been packed more securely on their end also.&nbsp;
