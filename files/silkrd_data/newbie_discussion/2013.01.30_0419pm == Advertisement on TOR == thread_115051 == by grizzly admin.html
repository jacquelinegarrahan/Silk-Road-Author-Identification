Than there is a chart on the Advertisement page (see &quot;Grizzly stats&quot; chart and place mouse pointer over the columns here: http://grizzlykijswtj2x.onion/#/advertise/ ). It shows search queries for the last 15 days.<br /><br />Unique IPs or simple visit counters are pretty much useless within TOR. That&#039;s why Grizzly uses search queries counter instead. It shows how many times someone actually used Grizzly for its purpose... and saw the results page... with ads on them...

With future rotation in mind, so technically there are more.<br /><br />Basically if someone places an ad with default bid (0,0001 BTC per impression), and than another someone bids 0,0003 BTC for his/her ad, the latter is shown. The one with 0,0001 bid just waiting for that other campaign to end though. And if no-one bids more meanwhile, his/her ad is shown.<br /><br />Simply put, minimal price is still 0,0001 BTC per single view until someone is willing to pay more. In the end market itself dictates the price. It&#039;s a sort of generalized second-price auction.

				Bye from Grizzly<br /><br />Grizzly was always meant as a business opportunity. Now it&#039;s clear it failed. Since it has no actual commercial value (no advertisers) and according to our aversion to the donation system we decided to kill The Bear. Grizzly is going out of business. This is the last couple of days for Grizzly search engine. Enjoy and... Ð¢HANKS FOR ALL THE FISH.<br /><br />PS. Special thanks goes to Demonfifa, the one and only advertiser to try Grizzly for commercial use. Thank you for that. He and his reliable services (credit cards for example) can be found at Black Market Reloaded.

				Here are some numbers some might find useful or just interesting:<br /><br />- main page visits since our launch in January - 230 000++<br />- search queries since the launch - 120 000++<br />- advertisement page views - ~230
