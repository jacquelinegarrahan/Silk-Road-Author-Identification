				So we&#039;ve got 2 people, neither ever tried LSD, both tried weed, and two LSD tabs/bottlers which are at least 110ug according to seller (he claims &quot;Dutch lab tested 120-150 ug&quot;). How do we use them? Just put them under our tongue and they&#039;ll dissolve? On the tongue? On the forehead and dance around? We&#039;re really clueless.<br /><br />Now i see people recommend to trip together and on the other hand&nbsp; they recommend a trip sitter.<br />If it&#039;s just the two of us, should we trip in turns or together?

				I would personally get two more and do two a piece.&nbsp; 1 tab each really won&#039;t do much for an LSD experience. <br /><br />Just pop em in your mouth, swallow and wait. Wait for a sunny day and venture out into a green field or FAMILIAR trek in some nearby woods. Don&#039;t go off too far as this is your first time and you could easily become confused. It&#039;s one of my favorite psychedelics and I once tried hiding a whole sheet (100 tabs) under my shirt at a hippie festival and it was flat against my skin. Sorta panicked when I saw two cops walking my way. At the time I didn&#039;t realize it could be absorbed by your skin and into your bloodstream. I also didn&#039;t realize I would start getting nervous and sweating. I was tripping for about 4 days no joke! Even for weeks after that I was questioning my own existence and if I was really a person!<br /><br />Just enjoy and don&#039;t sweat it :)<br /><br />-CC

				def. suggest you get another hit a piece i like to be around 300 - 350ug when i take Lucy. If its your first time DEF. have someone whos not tripping there to make sure everything gos smoothly they will have just as much fun watching you 2 tripping your balls off with a few beers @ hand. also if you dose @ night and want to sleep sometime withing 15hours i recommend you get your hands on some xannax or valume for the come down <br /><br />VIDEO GAMES ARE ULTRA FUN ON ACID

				If its your first time I&#039;d ease into it.&nbsp; Test the tabs by trying a half at first, wait 30 minutes, then take other half.&nbsp; Also have weed, beer, and some downers for later.&nbsp; Once you start getting off on both halves you&#039;ll kinda get a feel for it, then drop the other tab.&nbsp; Its great with female company, especially if they&#039;re doing it too.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t just drop two at once for a first time.&nbsp; Your first experience can be a memorable experience or a nightmare.&nbsp; You don&#039;t wanna be holding onto something saying &quot;Its just a drug, its just a drug&quot; like 50 times because you think your dying.&nbsp; Seriously dude, just be smart about it.

				Did two hits my first time and every time since. Agree with everyone - you can&#039;t have your first time twice so do it right.
