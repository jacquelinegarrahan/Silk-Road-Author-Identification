				Hey guys, I am not a vendor but have been a steady buyer for a couple months. I havent deposited more then 300 bucks at once, but I usually time it down to about 2 hours from my wallet to my SR account. Today I deposited a little more than that, and its been 6 hours and still nothing in my SR wallet. I see on blockchain that its getting tumbled, but how much longer, gosh
