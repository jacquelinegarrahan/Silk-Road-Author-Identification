				Great and like you&#039;re on top of the world. BUT, also so that you can still function as normal as one could possibly be after having taken some.<br />I have done a lot of reading about this and am know that if you can get good coke.&nbsp; You feel euphoric, amazing, alert, the best you ever have, all while being to come off to others as &quot;normal&quot; <br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;ve read where people have gotten some and they feel jittery and wig out, they sweat a lot and it&#039;s obvious that something is up and also everyone&#039;s comments about these effects were that is was not what they were hoping for.<br /><br />So, based off of everyone experiences, which vendors would you recommend so that I would feel great while being able to act normal, instead of having the jitters, wigging out and being pissed that I just pissed my money away on a product I didn&#039;t want.<br /><br />Lastly, are the any tips for anyone who has not taken any before? Should you eat a lot of food first? Should you drink a lot of water? Any info like that would be helpful!<br />Thank you in advance for any information and for any tips you give!<br />They will be much appreciated!!

				than just snort it, it&#039;s not a big deal.<br /><br />it&#039;s not easy to know who use cocaine, no easy at all if you never used cause you don&#039;t really know how to recognize it ;)<br />if someone say you are high on cocaine, maybe he/she used before you!<br /><br />watch and clean you nose before go in public lol<br /><br /><br />for good vendors, check the reviews theads
