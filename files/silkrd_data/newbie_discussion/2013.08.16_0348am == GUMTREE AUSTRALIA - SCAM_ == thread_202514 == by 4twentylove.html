				I am starting this post to see if any other members have been affected by the theivery of GUMTREE AUSTRALIA. I have recently attempted to sell +$1500AUD of goods using the service to test the waters vending before purchasing a vendor account. I thought it would be a good way to ease into vending while also providing some much needed funding for said vendor account and stock. I completed three transaction successfully with great communication from Captain Jack Sparrow (GUMTREE REPRESENTATIVE) with my payment processed promptly. I then received notice from CJS the majority of my products had sold and duely packaged, addressed and mailed all product to customers. Two weeks has now passed since i last heard from CJS or anyone at GUMTREE AUSTRALIA. I have checked the tracking on each package and all have been marked as successfully sent to the correct address. I have also periodically checking the GUMTREE AUSTRALIA website and have feedback has been left for my products by the customers who ordered my product using the GUMTREE AUSTRALIA &quot;service&quot;. <br /><br />Has anyone else had issues with GUMTREE AUSTRALIA or does anyone have any information on how to encourage them to pay what is owed to me? Any help or advise is vey much appreciated, if nothing else maybe this post will help another culable member being scammed by these dogs. &gt;:(&nbsp;

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey, I&#039;m sorry if you&#039;ve been having problems with GTA, they&#039;ve got a pretty solid track record so far, I&#039;d be surprised if they&#039;ve turned scammer. When&#039;s the last time you messaged them?

				Hi Hitch,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply and i also thought GUMTREE AUSTRALIA was a established, reputable vendor who could be trusted (if that is possible on SR) based on feedback, thier forum presence and also the first few successful transaction i completed before a total communication blackout.<br /><br />The last message i sent was the fourth that has so far not been replied to in the past month, i have checked my sent messages and can see they have been read. I have also noted feedback related to at least one of my products. I am owed in excess of $1000 and have pretty much resigned myself to the fact that i have learnt a lesson and will be much more circumspect in all future dealings. Although saying that, i would never use or recommend any of the GUMTREE type services due to thier ability to pull this scam with essentially no reprucussion other then a bad mention in forums. Considering what i have lost i would of being much better off just getting a vendors account ($500) and i would be +$1000 rather then -$1000.<br /><br />Im not going to get to stressed about it, as in my experience the universe has a way of ensuring all thieving dogs have their day and i imagine the vendor/s of GUMTREE AUSTRALIA wont be far away from theirs if they continue this sort of business. <br /><br />Thanks again for your reply and i hope at least to warn some users of their conduct based on my experience.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Cheers<br />4twentylove

				Established reputable vendor ???? the guys been around for like 5 minutes. I hate to break it to you but he is pulling or has pulled a scam so you should contact Silk Road support and see if they can get any of that money to you from his account. Highly unlikly but worth a shot

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nuh, they&#039;ve been around for a little while, and they&#039;ve got a stack of successful transactions, and the last time I checked them out they had all these plans about becoming a 24 hr service and opening up gumtree UK and Craigslist for America. They were going gangbusters, and it&#039;s the sort of service you wouldn&#039;t think anyone would walk away from. Zero risk, easy profits.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdmafx is right though op, if you haven&#039;t already you need to contact SR Support and let them know what&#039;s happening. Worst case scenario you lose your money but you help stop them scamming anyone else. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m going to remain cautiously optimistic that this one will get resolved positively. Best of luck 4twentylove, Hitch.

				Well my experience was all positive. I used Gumtree Oz when they first started two months ago and paid for 2 listings. Their rules were different then and once you paid the one-off fee for a listing ($22) you had a time limit and could sell as many orders as you could, with each order had a maximum of $150 each. The rules meant that there was no FE and I had to wait &#039;til the order was received and finalised before confirming and shipping the next order for each listing. With just two listings and over two weeks I sold over $4000 worth of product and all the Gumtree vendor got from all the legwork was 2x$22! <br />The dude from Gumtree realised after that they should charge commission on each sale ($6%?) as well as the listing cost. <br />I was pretty skeptical at first, but figured as long as I got paid after each finalisation, I could only get scammed a max of $150. The other issue was security, because over 2 weeks I was sent the postal addresses of over 25 buyers and I had no credentials or history on SR as a vendor. Also, I had no worries about getting bad feedback for bad stealth/shipping time/product etc. Just as well I was honest and very careful with all private Information and destroyed it as soon as it was shipped. I also was selling OxyContin 80&#039;s (OC&#039;s) at almost half what anyone else was selling on SR, so they went like hot cakes.<br /><br />So as you can see from my end it was a perfect way to sell a load of product with very little overheads or hassle and most importantly almost no risk!<br /><br />But I can see how easy it would be for GTA to turn bad.<br /><br />I have managed to get a bunch more of the Oxy&#039;s and some even better opiated and&nbsp; was thinking of using GTA again because I don&#039;t want the hassle of getting a vendors account, so Ill be keeping a close eye on Gumtree to see if these rumours are true.<br /><br />Please PM me if you have any info you&#039;d like to share? I might make it worth your while ;-)<br /><br />

				Thanks for your responses. Below if the correspondence i have had with SR Support, unfortunately it looks like there isnt much they can do to assist getting my $ or even helping other members to avoided been scammed by these wankers.<br /><br />from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;message&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk Road cannot offer support for these types of transactions as the vendor requires them to be finalized. You chose to run the risk of doing business in that manner with that vendor; if you wish to have full control over things you should set up a vendor account.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once the order is finalized the payment is released to the vendor and is no longer in escrow. As escrow is the system which enables SR staff to aid in dispute resolution, you will have to attempt to work it out directly with the vendor. If you can not work it out, my best advice is to keep this in mind when making future orders and post accurate feedback, including on the forum (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=7.0), so that other users may make informed decisions. In order for us to be able to protect you and your funds you need to stay within the safety of the escrow system.<br /><br />Please see the FAQ section of the SR Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I.27ve_already_finalized_my_order.2C_but_am_having_problems.<br /><br />~SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />4twentylove &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi SR Support<br /><br />I am contacting you regarding a vendor - Gumtree Australia who i believe has stolen from me. I have included the last email i sent to him (the third that has not been answered) which outlines the problem and provides you with my response thus far. I am not sure there is anything you can do to assist me getting the funds owned to me but i hope you maybe able to help others falling for the same scam.<br /><br />Please let me know if you require any further information and i am happy to assist anyway i can.Thanks for any assistance you can provide.<br /><br />Cheers<br />4twentylove<br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Hi CJS<br /><br />Can you please respond to my multiple emails re: AB3, AB6 and AB7. As outlined in my previous email your page is showing feedback from a customer who purchased AB7 which i have not received payment for. I have also checked the tracking on all packages and all have been delivered, yet i have not received any payment or correspondence from you?<br /><br />To tell you the truth this is becoming quite concerning and starting to look like i have been scammed out of a significant amount of $ by Gumtree Australia. I will be reporting you as a vendor to SR admin and will ensure i update all bulletin thread mentioning Gumtree Australia and its international afflitates to provide a detailed and accurate description of the &quot;service&quot; you provide (Im not sure many users will purchase your so called &quot;service&quot; when they learn it is basically just you thieving!)<br /><br />Obviosly this is very dissappointing and i hope you enjoy your ill gotten funds, its amazing how the universe has a way of sorting thieves and scumbugs out so i hope you are looking forward to return karma that you most surely deserve. I will be pleasantly surprised if you contact me before COB tomorrow and provided a resonable explanation as to why i should not proceed to report you to SR admin and how/when you will be resolving my orders?<br /><br />I dont mean to offend but as my previous three emails have not been responded to and you are showing as been active on the site each day this week, its obvious you have absolutely no problem offending others. Hopefully communicating in this way you may actually diegn to provide a response?&quot;<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />4twentylove<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
