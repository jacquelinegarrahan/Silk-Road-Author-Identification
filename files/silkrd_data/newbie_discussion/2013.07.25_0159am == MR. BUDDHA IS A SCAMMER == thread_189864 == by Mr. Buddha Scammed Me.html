				Mr. Buddha has scammed me and two other out of well over $10,000. Don&#039;t use him. He has had three 1/5 left in the past day. Here&#039;s what one says <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THIS GUY IS A FUCKING SCAMMER, A SMOOTHE TALKING CLEAR CUT SCAMMER, I GAVE HIM 7k FOR IN MAIL CASH OUT &amp; THE DUDE FUCKED ME SO HARD. THIS GUY DID SOMETHING THAT WILL LIKELY GET ME HURT IN THE LONG RUN, AND NOW HE CAN&#039;T EVEN MESSAGE ME. I HAVE HAD LIKE 5 OF HIS CUSTOMERS MSG ME ABOUT HIM TAKING THEIR MP&#039;S for BTC FUCK THIS DUDE IN THE ASS. PS: seriously though guys, I&#039;m a respected vendor/forum member and this guy is a total scammer, dead serious.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Another:<br />DO NOT ORDER; HE HAS THREE 1/5 WITHIN THE PAST DAY. HE IS NOT SENDING PEOPLE THEIR CASH. HE STOLE $5200 FROM ME. NOT A SINGLE MESSAGE.<br /><br />Echoing what the above said, he is a scammer. Won&#039;t even return messages, obviously is still selling btc for moneypaks. I am a vendor and this is not who you want to use to cashout. <br /><br />One last one:<br />HOLD ANY ORDERS** I have yet to receive my package in the mail as promised. Said was sent and now says he has no tracking. Gave 27BTC for cash in the mail over nite and never happened.<br />I will UPDATE , all my referral customers need to hold any new orders until i update this feedback.<br /><br />He&#039;s obviously scamming people.

				mrbuddha bitch scammed me too. I know better never to FE...but with bitinstant down I took a chance with moneypak--&gt;Bitcoin. Its a risky transaction to begin with and that bitch was (100) on stats, claimed a family issue for delays. Looks like he processed transactions to gain trust before the bulk orders started coming in...it&#039;ll be interesting to see how long his vendor account stays up. I know the risk and can live with the loss, but heed my warning DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER WITH MRBUDDHA!!!!!!

				Please get him down before anyone else loses money. Looks like he made away with tens of thousands of dollars. $525 of it is mine. I even told the fucker that his family was priority, and that I understood for the delay.<br /><br />Sucks man, one bad vendor can really fuck over a lot of people in a few days time.

This shit had me going.<br /><br />Good luck calling Monepak, let me type you this straight off the back of one of my many emptied Monepak cards sitting in front of me:<br /><br />&quot;FRAUD ALERT: Use your MonePak number only with businesses listed at www.moneypak.com. If anyone else asks for your Moneypak number, it&#039;s probably a scam. If a criminal gets your money, Green Dot is NOT responsible to pay you back.<br /><br />GREED DOT TRACKS THE USE OF THIS MONEYPAK. We provide transaction information and surveillance images to law enforcement to solve crimes. You may need to prove your identity to use the MoneyPak.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Well gentlemen, all we can take from this one is knowledge. We should have known better. I fucking know I should have. All those listings weren&#039;t suspicious? Hell yea they were. Any possible way to cash out, he put it all on the table. I knew right when I saw that first 3/5 one of you left when your 5k didn&#039;t arrive. He&#039;s smart about it to, nobody can leave feedback. <br /><br />I&#039;ll decline to say how much I lost from him, it hurts just to think about it. <br /><br />WATCH OUT for the growing trend of scammers who have a 100 rating with only a month&#039;s worth of petty work. <br /><br />Good luck,<br />Crimson Chin<br />

				I&#039;ll be the first one to want a scammer removed but didn&#039;t all this happen just in the last few days? What if the dude is sick in the hospital or a family member is. I think his account should be frozen until there is some explanation and he should be allowed to fill the orders. Failing that, he should be removed.<br /><br />But I&#039;m only playing the devil&#039;s advocate. I really feel for anyone who lost money. That sucks.

				mrbuddha walked away with so much cash..... He told everyone he was backed up with 60 orders after his &quot;family emergency,&quot; look at these estimates I have compiled from going through all the SR forums. Keep in mind that for every scammed customer (including myself) I find that has come forward I am ASSUMING that there is AT LEAST ONE who did not come forward:<br /><br />1-10 of them were greater than 5k and a couple greater than 10k = ~30k (conservative estimates)<br />10-15 of them were &lt;5k and &gt;1k = ~15k (conservative estimates)<br />25-35 of them were &lt;1k = ~12k (conservative estimates)<br /><br />On the low end he got out with 52k. Now, factor in the fact that he was using multiple accounts (he was, look up other reputable dealers who disappeared this week. Exact same story, different name) and we are looking at least &gt;80k on the low end estimate. However, there is a very high probability that this guy got out with six figures.....<br />
