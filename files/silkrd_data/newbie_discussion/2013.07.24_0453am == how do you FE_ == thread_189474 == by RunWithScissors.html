				it&#039;s not even a button.&nbsp; it&#039;s just the word &quot;finalize&quot; and when you mouse over it, it can be clicked, in case that wasn&#039;t enough. <br /><br />i would not fe.&nbsp; hang onto the coin.&nbsp; when the product arrives, release those funds.

				My first order was from a bigger german Vendor (trusted from the feedbacks in his profile), I don&#039;t want do mention his name because I have read Vendors who are asking for FE could get problems, and because I had no transaction at all he wanted from me to FE. I did and everything went perfect. I got best weed very fast and the communication was also great.<br /><br />So not only scammers are asking for FE. Since I have some transactions I also don&#039;t get asked anymore to FE. For Bulk orders with high amount i would NEVER fe!!<br />

				The fact that many successful transactions have required FE doesn&#039;t not make it a good idea to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve driven many places without wearing my safety belt and never gotten into an accident.&nbsp; So yeah, you can go ahead and not wear your safety belt.<br /><br />You see what I did?&nbsp; Finalizing when the product arrives is your safety belt.&nbsp; If the product you receive is not as advertised or worse, never received, you have the option to resolve that transaction as long as you have not finalized.&nbsp; You can go thousands of miles without NEEDING your safety belt, but when the time comes that you need it, you&#039;ll be damn glad you were wearing it.

				hahaha yes you shouldnt FE but if you are new with no stats at all<br />most vendors are going to ask you to FE,because they dont want to get scammed.<br />Do your research on the vendor,make sure they have a decent history and look over feedback.<br />In the begining sometimes you dont have a choice. start with small orders and some faith,<br />If you did your research you should be fine! good luck
