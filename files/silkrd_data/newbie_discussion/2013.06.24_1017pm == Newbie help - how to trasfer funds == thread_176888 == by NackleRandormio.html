				Hi there, fellow silk traders, buyers, sellers and freedom lovers.<br /><br />I am starting up, and in order to do so, I need to fund my account. The FAQ and the forum are pretty clear on the how´s, my only problem lies with Mtgox. I created an account there, and now I want to transfer funds, in order to buy bitcoins. My problems are as follow:<br /><br />1. Mtgox blocked my account for 24 hrs for using TOR. Is is safe or recommended to access my MtGox account on a non-TOR connection?<br />2. All options that I managed to browse through before Mtgox cockblocked me required me to be &quot;verified&quot; on Mtgox. This required ID sending and a load of stuff I don´t feel entirely comfortable with. Are there any methods to transfer money to MtGox account easy, fast, and harmless? If so, which one? :)<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for taking a minute or two to help out a newbie!<br /><br />

				Hello!!<br /><br />I&#039;m learning a lot about how to use SR on the last days, and althoug this is my second post in the forum, I think I can answer your questions.<br /><br />1- You shouldn&#039;t use TOR to access Mtgox, they don&#039;t like it...<br /><br />2- Nowadays it&#039;s necessary to verify the account by sending them the ID, bills...<br /><br />In my opinion, this is quite uncomfortable too, so I&#039;ve found a web from Germany where it is no necessary to send those documents in order to verify your account; if you&#039;re interested I&#039;ll send you the URL by pm, not to spam in the forum.<br /><br />On the other hand, I think you can use Mtgox quite safely because I think that most of the people here in SR use it... but it should be better if anyone more experienced than me could answer you, to give you peace of mind.

				Thanks a lot! vielen dank! It&#039;s good to see someone cares about noobies.<br /><br />I appreciate the intention, but I found a vendor on localbitcoin, and it seemed to work fine. However, I will contact you to get that site.<br /><br />Cheers, mate!
