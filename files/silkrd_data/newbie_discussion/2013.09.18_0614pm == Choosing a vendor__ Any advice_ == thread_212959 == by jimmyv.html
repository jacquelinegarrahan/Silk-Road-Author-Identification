				Hi,<br />When choosing a vendor is 1 month as a vendor + ten transactions and five positive reviews enough? Everything appears legit and communication is really good.<br /><br />Also does LE ever pose as a vendor or do they typically pose as a buyer? Any stories floating around about a vendor being LE?

				Sounds like you have suspicions but kinda hard when you don&#039;t say what vendor and what product your looking to purchase.&nbsp; Search for the vendors name and see if anyone has posted any reviews.. again hard to give Advice for choosing a vendor when you don&#039;t mention what your looking to get and the vendor in question hopefully one of his customers posted a review on here.<br /><br />-DC

				I would say that&#039;s enough for me to risk 50 bucks including shipping if they were the only sellers of what I&#039;m into.<br /><br />Don&#039;t FE.<br /><br />And LE posing as a vendor?&nbsp; I think with shipping and multiple jurisdictions, they can&#039;t do that.&nbsp; Not in any way to build up a solid reputation.&nbsp; And as a buyer?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Maybe if they think they know where &#039;VENDORX&#039; lives already, just to prove that they&#039;re selling, to close a case maybe.&nbsp; But where&#039;s your worry in that?<br /><br />

				My gut feels fine just wondering if it&#039;s enough of a history. Vendor is shadowtech but no reviews posted on the forums. Reviews for that vendor though seem good

				wouldn&#039;t buy off a vendor with such low fb myself. i guess the question you really have to ask yourself is can i afford to lose this money if it goes wrong.<br /><br />you have to remember that new sellers could easily make 5 or ten puppet accounts and make purchases off himself just to give himself some cred.

				If your worried bout LE, or, more realistic, worried bout being scammed, then just do your research, order from vendors with a better history, more transactions completed and lots o feedback.

				On the one hand, everyone has to start somewhere as a vendor, right? You can&#039;t start off with 300+ and 5.0.<br /><br />But yes, your gut also should be trusted.<br /><br />As for LE posing as a vendor, as others have said jurisdiction and such it&#039;s implausible, plus adding even those reviews just in the chance of getting someone, by chance, in their jurisdiction, is probably not enough of a ROI for them to bother since it wouldn&#039;t work enough to justify it.<br /><br />LE as a buy would be practically impossible, since it&#039;s difficult to determine ahead of time whether or not they are in your jurisdiction in the first place.

				The First Rule of Silk Road: Never FE.<br />The Second Rule of Silk Road: See First Rule.<br /><br />When choosing a vendor, you have to decide what is most important to you.<br />How much money do you want to spend?<br />Do you want your purchase as soon as possible?<br />Are you looking to save money and want quanity?<br />Is money not a factor and you want the best product available?<br />What amount are you wanting to purchase?<br />Do want to limit your purchases to domestic listings?<br /><br />Read the Reviews.&nbsp; If you read a number of a vendor&#039;s recent reviews, the answers to the questions above will be revealed.

One, I was his 1st customer and he sent me some fine assed C, some of the best I&#039;ve got on SR,&nbsp; and it was really fat weight wise as he was trying to impress me and get some positive feedback.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the order I followed right up with,, I liked it that much I went right&nbsp; back for more, he cancelled and he&#039;s never put up anymore more listings, too bad , like I said, quality was A+. He just had to work on his stealth a little. Vendor was Assesino . But, If I was concerned as the OP was, I wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; be gambling on new guys with low stats.

				As a vendor I will give you some friendly advice.<br /><br />When you find a vendor, try searching the forums for them and see what comes up.<br />analyze the feedback, Does it look like it has been left by different people or one person.<br />Check the listings they have up, If they have listings for 50 pills for example, they are unlikely to scam you for 5. It is not impossible but it is what is most likely.<br />If the communication is good and they are a down to earth type of person then you might want to give them&nbsp; a shot. all vendors have to start somewhere, so he has to get reviews somehow.<br />Check their prices, if they are too good to be true they probably are.<br /><br />All the best and good luck

				Not sure about the other missing feedback. Is it negative, positive or did they forgot to leave it? Who knows.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give them a shot so I&#039;m hoping they come through. They certainly weren&#039;t the cheapest. I&#039;ll update as things progress
