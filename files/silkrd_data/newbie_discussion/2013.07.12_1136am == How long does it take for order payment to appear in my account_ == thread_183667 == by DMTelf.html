				Noticed I&#039;ve gotten three orders for samples but the funds are not in my account yet, is that normal? |How long does it usually take? I presume there may be a lag depending on how busy the system is ...<br /><br />My free DMT samples are here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/046399cf41<br />My free 3-meo-pcp samples are here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d9e8affed4<br />My free GHB samples are here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6a99f7d365

				Have you read the seller guide and about how escrow works? I&#039;m going to guess you will not see anything in your account until the buyers finalize.

				They won&#039;t appear in your account until they have been finalized, and your customers won&#039;t finalize until they&#039;ve received the samples.<br />I&#039;ve also PMed you on the main site about removing or reducing the postage for UK-UK as I don&#039;t have enough BTC to order and I&#039;m not going to go to all the trouble to buy 0.05 btc.<br /><br />I&#039;m also going to sneakily quote what you say on your vendor page &quot;Since I am a new seller totally free small samples will be sent discreetly before any money exchanges are made, I will not ask for you to pay even the pnp. &quot; :P

Or at least a free option for UK residents such as myself.
