				Have heard mainly positive things about BST, of course it&#039;s best to do a forum search to see if they have a review thread as well. Do as much research as you can!

				Well I dove in and used them and low and behold had the BTC in about 2 hours after the deposit. The fees were lower than bitinstant and was easy since I have a BOA down the street. Highly recommended for any who need BTC. If I find a cheaper way to get BTC I will post.

				Just wanted to post in here given the problems that BST has been having lately. I purchased a sizeable amount of coins from them early last week and everything went very smooth, communication was top notch. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll take care of whatever issues they are currently having.
