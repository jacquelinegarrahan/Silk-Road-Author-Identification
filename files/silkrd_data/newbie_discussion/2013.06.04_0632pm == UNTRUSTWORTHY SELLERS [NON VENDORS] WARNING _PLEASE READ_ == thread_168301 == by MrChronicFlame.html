				Should be stickied.<br /><br />Common sense ain&#039;t common. No street smarts either. People forget who they&#039;re buying from or don&#039;t think about who they could be buying from.

				I think some very useful common sense on this thread...<br /><br />I&#039;m a fairly new vendor, but try to treat others with respect and courtesy. I try to describe my products well and answer all questions as well as I can. I then send quickly, carefully and to the best of my ability. I hope the feedback reflects my attitude - it&#039;s basic professional conduct, but probably a little lacking in some vendors - though I would hope there are plenty more of the good type!<br /><br />Anyway, great to alert people to take care..<br /><br />Thanks to the OP for the constructive approach :)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc

				Thanks DrCol, <br /><br />I was expecting to get some messages improving it, by other people but I think I hit the nail on head on the most part.<br /><br /><br />BTW DrCol, I&#039;ll check out your inventory if your new, goodluck, safe travels.

				I will add something...it&#039;s a life lesson too.<br /><br />You can pick up a great deal from a persons word and deeds...so just speak to a vendor - test the water...see if you like the person you&#039;re interacting with...how does your instinct spark...? Initial gut feeling (even online) can be very powerful and give a good indication of the quality and integrity of the person.<br /><br />Do you like them? Do they seem to have a sense of decency? Do they give a shit about your questions, concerns or just engage well in a friendly but professional manner.<br /><br />That&#039;s who I deal with - if I get anything else I know there&#039;s plenty more to trade with, banter with...life&#039;s short so don&#039;t waste it dealing with people you&#039;d &quot;much rather kick in the eye&quot; (Morrisy/Smiths for those who know!)<br /><br />Good luck and be safe<br /><br />Doc

				basically it comes down to reputation and reviews and also:<br /><br />make sure the vendor appears to participate in discussions and tries to keep customers in the loop when an issue related to production or delivery issues in their country come up.<br /><br />also make sure the vendor appears aware of all new mail delivery techniques for identifying suspect packages.<br /><br />
