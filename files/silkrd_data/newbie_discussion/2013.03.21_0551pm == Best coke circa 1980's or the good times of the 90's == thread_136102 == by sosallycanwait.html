				Ok guys, if money wasn&#039;t a problem and you could recommend a current seller who has the best top notch charlie who would you go with? There are quite a few currently on sale, all claiming to be pure, and mixed reviews. <br /><br />I just want a bloody good night out with my friends and am willing to pay for it.

				I&#039;m in the UK also, and from what I have read on the forums Budwork UK and LloydsBrothers have the best cocaine here.<br />I have ordered other drugs from Budworx myself and he was great with communication, his product arrived on weight and if not for a problem with Royal Mail it would have arrived quickly too.

				You should have just that! Budworx was sent for testing by the community, it came 84% pure with no cuts at all, which is incredibly high.<br />Also he has 15% off which ends today which is a nice bonus.
