				Ok, so I&#039;ve been lurking for a while, came close to ordering a few times but the volatile nature of the value of BTC as well as some other factors gave me the feeling I should wait till I felt a better vibe. Well I am ready to take my first step on the road, I am looking to buy some mary jane and I am overwhelmed by the vendors and strains available to choose from. As someone who considers themselves a picky pot head I am seeking some assistance in pointing me towards something that satisfy what I am looking for.<br /><br />Seeing as it&#039;s my first buy I feel most comfortable starting off with a quad. I have no problems paying up to 120 USD for 1/4 zip of&nbsp; top shelf, AAA, or some of the best smoke you will come across. I am aware there are vendors that offer very good weed for a lot less and if they have a strain that would fulfill my desires while providing safe stealth and good service I would def pull the trigger. I am just stating whats my monetary limit for this first order as well what I am looking for in my &quot;high&quot;. I want a&nbsp; sativa based high. While never having smoked a pure or relatively pure sativa, I desire the uplifting, heady, euphoria producing high that is characteristic of sativa strains. I do not want to smoke and get couch locked, groggy, or have to fight the urge to go to sleep. So no Indica dominant strains. Music and writing are two things I spend a lot of time on while in an elevated state of mind so I need something that is conducive to these activities.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that some strains seem to greatly enhance my music listening experience. Also, while smoking quality herb I get lightning bolts of inspiration driving me to write with improved skill, tapping into creative energies that allow me to produce thoughts and writings that I would otherwise have difficulty articulating clearly or the way I want to. I don&#039;t care for super compact buds nor really fluffy buds. I like buds that you can just stick in your bowl or bong without having to break up really, yet, breaks down and will burn nice in a blunt as I enjoy smoking a nice L when the mood strikes me.<br /><br />Thank you for any suggestions, advice, recommendations or any other constructive input you may offer.

				I have only ordered weed twice as I can get good stuff regular enough IRL. <br /><br />The first I ordered from TheHerbalist which came in about 3 days from order but the Fat Bud Food(or whatever it&#039;s called) he sells is not to any high standard to say the least. His other stuff must be of a higher standard. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m currently waiting on an order from Mr Cronk which is supposed to be next day delivery but already been more than 3 days from marked intransit. I will update this for you when I get the package or when Mr Cronk replies my message. <br /><br />These are my only two experiences with weed on SR so I&#039;m not best equipped to give out advise but nonetheless I hope this is helpful in some way. <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />M

				Ive seen a lot of people say good things about XXXotica, Farmer, ChristyNugs, ogbyran, norcalking, weedgirls, thurgood (dont think I can order from him yet tho)... I just know they go through strains pretty fast so while I am confident I can find a vendor I am satisfied with, I am more concerned in getting a strain that matches my needs. So if anyone has received some flowers that they think would suit what I am looking for I&#039;d give me a good starting point. It is a little overwhelming....

				Welcome, I think you will find SR is a cannabis enthusiast&#039;s paradise. I&#039;ve gotten some good sativas on the road. A few names to drop would include SativaSally/420budman, PrivateReserve, CalliGreen, CaliforniaCannabis and a few others. The one that got me the highest so far without a doubt was Sour Diesel from PrivateReserve. There&#039;s something unique about that one. If you want a really clear high I&#039;ve found making cannabutter to be the clearest. Vaporized the next clearest. Smoked the least clear, but the most &#039;high&#039;.

				Keyzer, if you have been lurking long, then you should know of the wealth of, and different types, and strains out there. First bit of advice find a high ranking sellar with good ratings. Read their review thread, If they are a really reliable vendor, their reviews will tell you if you can trust them and what people think of their product. Talk to the vender. He will have some kind of Email address ie.. Yada.Tormail. Ask him questions, more than likely you&#039;ll0 get an honest answer. Pick an choose, I like to get different strains just to see whats out there. My exp[eriences have been good and looking forward to more. enjoy the road!
