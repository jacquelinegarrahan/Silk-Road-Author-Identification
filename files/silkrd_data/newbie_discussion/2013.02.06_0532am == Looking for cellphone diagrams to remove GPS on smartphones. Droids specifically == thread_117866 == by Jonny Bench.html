				Trying to remove the GPS on my phones.<br />I tried figuring it out on one phone, managed to disable everything but the gps...any break it in the process but that&#039;s trial and error.<br />If anyone has any diagrams for droid phones or could point me in the right direction I would be grateful.<br />I only use throw away phones, can&#039;t be too safe these days.

				What exactly is it that you&#039;re trying to prevent? LE from tracking you through GPS data? I&#039;m not 100% sure, so verify what I&#039;m about to say, but your gps data isn&#039;t stored by any wireless carrier I know of. It&#039;s stored on your phone and given to any apps that you granted access to it. So don&#039;t grant location data access to any suspicious apps, and encrypt your phone with a strong passphrase. And then leave your phone at home when you go to make drops.<br /><br />Btw, using an access point that can be traced to you isn&#039;t very smart. Your wireless carrier will be able to tell that you&#039;re logged onto Tor, and if shit hits the fan, that will be yet another thing you&#039;ll have to explain to a judge. Also, in the EXTREMELY rare event that an adversary has impersonated a guard node, they would know who you are (via your IP address) and what you&#039;re viewing and transmitting via tor.<br /><br />So long story short, use an access point that cannot be traced to you, period. And REMEMBER: Tor only helps you with anonymity, NOT encryption. And it only does that well if used correctly.

				Let me elaborate.<br />These are prepaid phones. My phones aren;t registered to me in the least. They are registered to people like Donald Duck. I keep them for one month and discard for a new one.<br />I want to remove GPS to add an extra layer of security and to keep feds from activating my GPS and finding out exactly where I am. Which they can do with almost no effort. getting a warrant is easy.<br />I connect through my cell phone to tor. My IP location shows I&#039;m in whatever state&nbsp; I register the number. Example. Last phone was registered in Cali, showed my location as being in oakland, ca when I was on a business trip to NY. Feds have a few devices used to track, crack and locate your wireless devices. StingRay II, AmberJack, KingFish, TriggerFish and LoggerHead are just a few of them.<br />Can they see through that little ruse? yes, of course but it will take them a little bit longer to realize my location is not bound by ip and its one more warrant needed.<br />In this game, every second counts

				You can root your android handset and remove the gps software, for sure.<br /><br />As for actually removing the receiver/antenna hardware, you can&#039;t do that without wrecking the handset.<br /><br />

				I know on older gps phones you could remove the antennae. It doesn&#039;t remove the GPS but it does make it virtually impossible to get a signal which is almost as good. <br />I opened up my last phone, a newer droid but couldn&#039;t find the GPS chip. Damn near figured out how to disable everything else except the gps.<br />

As technology becomes more mature and widespread the manufactures start to incorporate new features on to the same chips internally to reduce cost/space/power requirements. Almost all smartphones have the GPS functionality incorporated nowadays.<br /><br />Your best option would be a custom ROM without the GPS hardware drivers. Another option (depending on the hardware) would be to physically remove the GPS antenna from the handset. Although this wouldn&#039;t disable the GPS functionality it would certainly make it extremely difficult (but not impossible) for the handset to acquire a GPS lock.<br /><br />The custom ROM is definitely to way to go and there are plenty of forums containing these. Just do a Google search for custom Android ROM...<br /><br />HTH,<br />Chopper.<br /><br />EDIT: Sorry JonnyB - I didn&#039;t see your post about the antenna trick...

				You`re not tracked via GPS, you`re tracked via the cell(s) your phone is connected to. Disabling GPS doesn`t change anything. A cellphone tracking throught GPS only works at stupid TV shows like CIS:

				What Sappaloth said. You can be tracked with gps and tower reception.&nbsp; They can track you pretty well using just the tower info.&nbsp; Just make sure cell doesn&#039;t transmit any questionable data without encryption and you should be safe enough.&nbsp; Its impossible to be 100% safe when dealing with potentially illegal activities.&nbsp; The trick is in making the difficulty of busting you greater than your level of involvement.<br />halleo

				Thanks chopper, I didn&#039;t know they made custom roms like that. Guess that will be my next move, I&#039;ve officially fried this phone so off to get a new one and try again. I&#039;ll look into the roms first before I buy the next gadget.<br />I appreciate the response.<br />Sap, I know they use the stingray to ping off towers to track your cell&#039;s general vicinity but they have to be within distance of you (mobile surveillance vehicles usually). I know there&#039;s no 100% sure way to do this but I&#039;m taking every precaution necessary to ensure it&#039;s as difficult as possible for them.<br />To include relaying calls off forwarded virtual numbers to virtual numbers. I figure if I do this and I keep my phones for only 1 month at a time (usually less), it should make it fairly difficult for them to track. It&#039;s a little expensive being as paranoid as I am but it&#039;s worth it in the end if it keeps me a free man.<br />

To track you by using your GPS, someone has to get a software on your phone, that reads the GPS data and sends it to someone else. It`s much much easier to track you by using the cell network data. And it´s even more accurate, cause GPS doesn´t work well every time and every where.
