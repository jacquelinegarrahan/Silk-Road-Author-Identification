				Governments have some control over the clearweb, apparently by influencing ISP&#039;s and big players like Google to filter content and render data. <br /><br />So far, it seems, they have little control over the darkweb.&nbsp; True or no?&nbsp; Could they gain such control? <br /><br />What percentage of servers does the government control?&nbsp; What kind of control can a government have over traffic crossing its borders?<br /><br />I rather suspect there was a day when the government could shut down the internet, back when it was primarily if not exclusively used for defense and the educational system.&nbsp; But now? <br /><br />You get the feeling from reading the media that the cat&#039;s pretty much out of the bag.&nbsp; Twitter and YouTube have changed the face of grass-roots politics and revolution.&nbsp; Guaranteed, governments everywhere, including nominally free states, would like to get on top of that action, if they could.&nbsp; Not to mention all the shenanigans going on in the dark web.&nbsp;

				Remember &quot;The Great Firewall of China&quot; and how they restricted almost all access to any internet domains outside of the country? This is the same country that now encourages black hat hacking in order to steal other country&#039;s secrets. Security is the name of the game, if someone is using anonymous clients and sending encrypted emails back and forth then it&#039;s pretty obvious they got something to hide.<br /><br />Government can do what they want. As a matter of fact, if I were the asshole in charge I wouldn&#039;t want to take the internet down. I&#039;d set up a gang of proxy servers and just monitor the hell out of them for awhile, collecting mass amounts of traffic data, and eventually figure out what all that data means so that I could track down who I wanted in order to use it against them. Infiltration of the &quot;dark web&quot; is nothing new to them, they&#039;re the ones who created it. <br /><br />With the &quot;internet of everything&quot; &amp; IPv6 coming around the bend virtually everything will have an IP address. Then so much constant data is going to be processed it will make whatever the NSA goons are doing right now look like a joke. My whole outlook on the situation is forget about the government, they&#039;re just a bunch of criminals themselves anyway. They probably got better things to do, like catching terrorists.<br /><br />&nbsp;::)&nbsp; &nbsp;:-X

				They can control the internet in its current form but the beauty of this evolutionary arms race is that for every step they take we take 2-3 ahead in time. Even if every government in the world found a way to cut access to the internet, eventually the rebellious and determined would make something to replace it that would be better.

				Nah, there&#039;s no way they could control it. I think if they tried, it would be the most monumental undertaking in the history of civilization.
