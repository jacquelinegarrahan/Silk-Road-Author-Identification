				&gt;&gt;&gt; UPDATE TUES 9th JULY 13 &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Lots of posts trying to direct people to an Atlantis phishing page with the title <br /><br />Silk Road&#039;s Biggest Competition: [CENSORED: scam link][redacted some info]<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />If you do open an account on Atlantis you are strongly advised NOT to use the same credentials you use for your SR account. Many people have had their SR accounts hacked after using the same credentials and following the Atlantis phishing link mentioned above. Apparently the Atlantis phishing link does also create an account on the real Atlantis site.<br /><br />Your SR credentials should be unique to SR and be complex enough to avoid being compromised. <br /><br />DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE LINKS ON THE HIDDEN WIKI AND WIKIPEDIA.ORG TO ACCESS SR<br /><br />The only link that you should ever use to access SR is:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />Recently there has been a sharp increase in the number of cases of members reporting that they have been scammed by trying to access SR via fake URLs.<br /><br />Phishing is a technique used by hackers to trick you into giving them your password and PIN. It is a serious problem on hidden services because the URL is so hard to remember and can be imitated. Fake URLs are often advertised on the hidden wiki and wikipedia.org. If you registered on a fake site pretending to be Silk Road, your account will be compromised and your money stolen. We HIGHLY recommend that you change your PIN and password before making your first deposit. Don&#039;t be another victim, change your PIN! <br /><br />Please note that once your coins have been withdrawn there is nothing SR support can do to help recover them.<br /><br />If you have already fallen for this scam and are now only ready this after the fact you need to contact SR support on the main site as soon as possible. This will probably mean that you will need to create a new temporary account to do this, as you will undoubtedly have lost control of your account as the scammers will change your pass phrase. Please do not post in the forums until after you have contacted SR support as the moderators are unable to assist you beyond telling you to do what is stated above as all you will do is waste valuable time in having the issue investigated by SR support.<br /><br />The SR login page will never ask for your pin number, just your username, pass phrase and captcha. If for whatever reason you find yourself being asked to enter your pin at the login stage you should immediately be alerted to the fact that the link you are using is not trustworthy, NEVER ENTER YOUR SR PIN AT LOGIN.<br /><br />The time frames involved to have your pass phrase reset by SR support will mean that if you fall victim to this scam there will be nothing SR support can do in time to prevent your coins from being stolen.<br /><br />I strongly urge all new forum members to thoroughly research all of the information on the SR wiki before making any purchases. Investing the time to educate yourself on how to use SR as safely as possible will help you to avoid making some very costly mistakes.<br /><br />The link to the SR wiki is:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Stay safe<br /><br />SSBD<br />

				Good call samesamebutdifferent and scout for making it stickied. Memorising SilkRoad&#039;s addy isn&#039;t difficult, I memorised it like this:<br />silkroad<br />vb5<br />piz<br />3r<br />Haven&#039;t forgotten it since. Stay safe everyone :)

				Yeah, i noticed the scam when i was trying to make a new account. the scam just says that registrations were closed.&nbsp; i tried to add a warning to the hidden wiki that it might be a scam, but i refreshed the page, and POOF! it&#039;s gone.<br /><br />i thought that was the real site since the &quot;real silkroad&quot; was down, i thought it moved.<br /><br />( i put swear words in the scam just for fun, just like i do with &quot;free robux&quot; and more scams )<br /><br />so yeah, be careful.

				Nice thread here. I almost fell for a fake site the second time I signed in. I looked at the address and it was way wrong. In addition I would like to add another experience of mine. I got scammed by trying to use INSTAWALLET through TOR onion routing. This was my mistake because I briefly read about putting bitcoins in a secure wallet other than in SR account. To make a long story short. DO NOT USE &quot;INSTAWALLET&quot; THAT HAS A ONION ADDRESS. Like this:&nbsp; http://3rlqkicvauds47ch.onion/wallet.php?w=IcD2HASwDK4LsiIWaYWH8Zbk0&nbsp; This is the site I went through to transfer my bitcoins from MTGOX to who fucking knows....&nbsp; The real instawallet is a .ORG site and reputable from what I researched. Before you do anything, research the hell out of these forums. Learn from my mistake. Trust no one. There is an unusual amount of shady characters lurking this area of the web. I believe this is the right thread to post. I also posted this in BitCoin scam thread as well.

				I think starting new hidden wiki could help things a lot. I know there have been several &quot;new&quot; hidden wikis, but they are all the same. I&#039;ve personally tried to add sites to the hidden wiki. Sometimes it is editable, sometimes it is not. Every time I have put a hidden service that I&#039;ve hosted on there the same thing happens.<br /><br />First it is left alone for a period of time. I presume whoever hosts the hidden wiki is checking out my site and looking for where they might profit. If my site does not have a profit motive and includes some form of contact, I will get a message trying to sell me &quot;preferred&quot; listing on the hidden wiki. This could be from the host, or it could be a scam. Either way I&#039;m not buying shit.<br /><br />If my site does have some profit motive, results are different. If it is even slightly similar to all the scam sites on the top of the page, it gets removed, and I get a message telling me how much it would cost to keep it on there. If I put it back up it gets removed almost immediately.<br /><br />The hidden wiki would stand to profit more by hosting scams. Legitimate services will be found without the hidden wiki, so they don&#039;t need to pay anyone off to post their link. Scammers need something like a wiki to host their links. People seem to have a false trust with wiki pages. So it is the perfect setup.<br /><br />I am a bit curious though as to weather SR ever paid to be on the hidden wiki. There was, at one time, a legitimate link to SR on the current hidden wiki. It was there for some time, then was removed. It was there off and on before the current phishing link got prime placement.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a lot of good links on the hidden wiki. They are farther down the page, and are mostly random sites that aren&#039;t very profitable.<br /><br />A new hidden wiki that actively purges scams and locks good links to known hidden services would benefit everyone. I&#039;ve thought about putting one up myself, but haven&#039;t been enthusiastic enough to commit 24/7 up-time for a new VM. I hate to see all the people getting scammed now. I like to think that getting scammed is a lesson learned in security, but having a hidden wiki with fake links makes it really shitty.<br /><br />Maybe someone else has some spare hardware laying around and would just love to throw up a new wiki. If not I might put one up.<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t take long to remove all credibility from the current hidden wiki and make it&#039;s operation no longer profitable.<br /><br />Also....I...uuh...hear a lot of those scam sites on the hidden wiki are the same person. I MAY have noticed that many were hosted on the same ubuntu VM. And...uhh...it might be possible that this person is terrible at that language that rhymes with GHB. Also, that thing in unix that prevents users from accessing what they aren&#039;t allowed to access...hmm..can&#039;t remember what that is. Seems like he can&#039;t either. Fucker knows how to backup a VM though. Shame really, because sometimes the plural of that 5-letter word for a piece of furniture to place things suddenly all get dropped. I....can&#039;t imagine why. They always come back though. I suppose a dedicated group could wipe out most of the scams on the hidden wiki right now.<br /><br />Okay time for me to shut my mouth. And then open it to enjoy some tasty beer.&nbsp; 8)

				Before the address was simplified (and before I had it memorized) I would refer to the one on Wikipedia just to be safe. I know it can be changed, but generally this is spotted and reverted to the correct one.<br /><br />The shortened URL is really easy to remember though, much easier than keys and passwords for the site and whatnot, which I don&#039;t dare keep in any digital form for safety reasons.

				I must say when i first started out i fell for a phishing link. The site asks for your user/pass/pin as well as captcha. <br /><br />Then when i thought i had forgot my details i tried to register and it said &#039;registration disabled&#039; so those are the things to look out for aswell.<br /><br />Fortunately i have changed my password and pin since and have had no problems.

				Well I&#039;m not a noob and I thought he was legit...good thing I&#039;ve made this mistake in the past and learned from it. You ever read the back of a MP, in the yellow area? Yea well hopefully he&#039;s good at covering his tracks cuz mine sure are and he&#039;s all over the clearnet. Oh one more thing, it&#039;s not illegal to purchase btc&#039;s. Extortion and stealing is illegal though kids...so this jerk off will either be be getting pounded by big bubba in no time or, (apparently he&#039;s been advertising on reddit, what an idiot lol.) <br />P.S.

				Thank you for posting this warning! I just joined and am still learning the ins and outs of the Tor browser and .onion sites. It is very helpful to get tips along the way aside from what my friends have already told me. It seemed like a lot to learn at first, hearing it explained, but I am seeing now that things aren&#039;t so hard as long as I take it one step at a time.

				This was an interesting read, I feel it should be posted here for review<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=69774">Quote from: SupportLynda on May 13, 2013, 11:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Good morning Silk Road vendors and buyers, my name is Lynda. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Silk Road.<br />Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week, and that there has been some strange goings on since it being back online. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this, many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.<br />I will tell you that domestic rate options are one (choose to view in EUR &amp; GBP as well as USD) and also a new exchange feature will be implemented next month. We have also added more admin accounts which will be better staffed to assist you.<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. This can all be verified with DPR&#039;s forum post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138016.0 Or message him here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/b1e30b5819 Please do not speak about this on the forums yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Dread Pirate Roberts share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200&#039;000 per month or $2&#039;400&#039;000 annually Shares will be priced at ฿4 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your SR account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it.<br />Payment address - 1E7MvdRjSvCCPNPhNwAqKVsYSwFj2Bpp9x<br /><br />If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.<br />Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging SR Financial here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/733d1d49e8 with your Transaction ID, User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total btc sent.<br /><br />Example Subject - SR Investments<br />277349296<br />Lynda - 4 x 0.1 - ฿16<br /><br />This is strictly first come, first served. As, said before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.<br /><br />Current price is ฿4 BTC per 0.1% share. This will reward you with around $200 per month. This may well be subject to increase.<br /><br />Thank you and good luck<br />Lynda SR Staff<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone else seen this come through?

				This is a great post and a must read for all new members. Unfortunately, this happened to me only a week ago. I still can&#039;t recall how I ended up on a phishing site. I know the url and do not surf while I&#039;m on SR. Even so it happened. I recommend making a small deposit into the account that SR provides for you (.01 btc) just to be safe and make sure it&#039;s correct. I did this after the fact and it only took an hour or so to fund my SR account. Be safe and happy buying!!<br /><br /><br />MrB08

I hate being new, you feel stupid and look stupid .. grrr.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading and reading and reading and thought .. heck, I&#039;ll just ask .. the most they can do is kick me off for being stupid ..<br /><br />On another note; it really is good to be here, i like the sense of community ..

				Should have read this topic earlier :-/<br /><br />Just visited Silk Road over this wiki: http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page and couldn&#039;t log in...<br />It says the address is http://silkroad2eipagnk.onion.<br /><br />Luckily it&#039;s a new account and I have no Bitcoins in it. Changed password and pin immediately. Do you think it&#039;s save to use it or should I create a new one?

				I think i have just nearly been scammed. I have been trying to log on for the last few days to a web address different to the one on this forum for the past 2 days&nbsp; http://silkroadv5p5cbl6.onion/. I tried to send bitcoin to my account 2 days ago but was told it could take up to 72 hours as i was a new member on the currency exchange site. It seems like my bitcoin has not arrived yet as my transaction history shows no action. I have now changed my pin and password. It looks like i read this just in time. Thank You

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages. I pointed out that their Site was the same as &#039;Executive Outcomes&#039; (EO) and they posted a disclaimer that they had nothing to do with them immediately.<br />&nbsp;<br />They said a tracking number would be provided in 7-12 days- so they have around a week and half to prove this. But I am not hopeful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also wrote to Executive Outcomes- and only got this in reply- &quot;Thanks another scam&quot;. They are identical to AD, just look jazzier.<br />&nbsp;<br />For example, just look at the spelling mistake on both sites: http://imwvq3drst5zens6.onion/index.php ... er=product on EO and on http://2ousn6z3qfxvcv7t.onion/ArmsDepot ... oductID=84 on AD. It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites??? Smells very fishy to me.<br />Luckily I placed a very small order on AD I could afford to lose. Losing money is losing money- but the lesson is worth it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bests<br />Shenobie

				Yeah, I came across one. Just about evey link on this particular wiki was scammed. What you need to rember is that there are several Hidden Wikis and mirrors. The best way to tell if a HW is legit, you can always check the history pages. A good one will usually have an active admin.<br /><br />&nbsp;The one I use now doesn&#039;t even list SR. Probably beause it has been scammed so many times.<br /><br />There&#039;s a &quot;Hidden Wiki&quot; board on Torchan which is usually helpful. But don&#039;t trust everything yu read there, either.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				I buy my btc off a stealth clearnet ran by a vendor here way before SR.<br /><br />Me and mny girlfriends got scammed of 5 grams of cocaine with some embedded photo scam on SR but so did a lot of others and we all know that its a risk buying on the darknet as it is called.<br /><br />We also lost a few hundred dollars on some bitcoin selling website.<br /><br />But for a girl this is better than asking some gangster for pure cocaine.<br /><br />SR is easy as I remember the address.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the info. I ended up a scam site at first from the hidden wiki. Fortunately I hadn&#039;t signed up yet and got frustrated with the register link not working, then found the real site. Noticed the scam site did ask for the PIN at login too which is a giveaway.

				FYI one of the two links on the Hidden Wiki points to a phishing site. A user &quot;Bigboss2013&quot; has repeatedly edited the wiki over the last 2 months to point to http://hplink.site40.net, which is a well-executed phishing site that redirects correctly to the SR. Unless you consciously check the URL when logging in it is easy to fall prey to this. I made this mistake earlier today but was lucky to be able to change my password before any harm was done.<br /><br />I am not quite sure why users like this are not banned from the Hidden Wiki (~70 phishing related edits ought to do it). Best you can do is stay careful &amp; bookmark the right URL.<br /><br />

				Good that you bring this up so the scammers don&#039;t get any cash.

				Never take for sure that a Hidden Service is &quot;safe&quot;. Particularly for wikis that keep being defaced by scammers - i.e. the Hidden sh*t - but that&#039;s true for any service you&#039;ve been used to trust.

				Very informative guys. I guess i just got lucky when i discovered the SR link. I just typed SR into google and got the right one. Learning PGP and tails now...PGP easy...tails is a mission, but getting there. Bit concerned when i see all these people blindly FE on the vendors i wanna use, just know i&#039;m gonna b asked 2 do the same. Guess being caught between a rock and a hard place is the same 4 all newbies. I&#039;m just gonna stick to low purchases with the Weed vendors to limit any possible damage, until i got 10 transactions behind me.

				I too fell for this atlantis scam cunt . All i did was browse the site and clicked on one link there for a Vendor selling subutex/suboxone that directed me to a wiki page i closed. I only lost 1 dollar (.02 bitcoins) thankfully as my SR account was near empty and I had no active transactions. I am confused however because i used a unique pin and password and only used the same user name when i signed up for the web site so I don&#039;t know how they got my pin. Luckily they did not change my password and lock me out of my SR account. I&#039;m guessing 1 dollar was not enough for them to be concerned. I am not about to lose my account reputation however that i built over the past 1.75 years. I changed my password,wallet address and my pin after closing down TOR and running virus protection software. I&#039;m not a computer expert by any means but I usually use better sense than I did yesterday when this all took place so I&#039;m feeling awfully stupid at the moment. I&#039;m wondering how they did it though and If I am safe. I checked and none of my past ratings, comments were changed on vendors. ? Any people that truly understand what happened please try to explain and give helpful feedback. I&#039;m a nice honest person and just do not want to be fucked here.

I closed out tor, ran virus protection, deleted the link i had for that fake SR alternative site that i too found on a review from a vendor page. I guess admins to a great job of deleting these assholes postings in the forum but they can not possibly keep up with product purchase reviews and PM&#039;s. Anyways i then changed my pin, changed my password, and changed my wallet address.<br /><br />I should be able to deposit to this address now a small amount to see if it is 1 safe and 2 immediately available/active as my new wallet address. I would think after you create the new wallet it is instantly available no? it&#039;s been 12 hours and i was going to do a deposit within a day or 2. anyone please answer?????

The Info&#039;s there, just spend some time and look. It even says on your account page change you PIN before every transaction.

				I have two questions regarding this PSA.<br /><br />1) Am I understanding this correctly:&nbsp; Some asshole could set up a phishing site where I would *create* a SilkRoad username, passphrase, and PIN, and be able to access the SR.&nbsp; Then I add money and he takes it. . . .BUT, If I change my passphrase + pin before adding money, I&#039;m safe?&nbsp; Even though I (somehow) signed up for the *real* SR while on a *fake* phishing site?&nbsp; Am I ever truely on the real SR if I registered on a phishing site?&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; When I came to the SR for the first time the other day, I typed in: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and got the SR.&nbsp; I did NOT type in &#039;http://&#039; or finish with &#039;/&#039; -&nbsp; Even now, when i look at the top of the screen in this forum on on the SR, i dont see the &#039;http://&#039; in the url.&nbsp; Is that something to be concerned about?&nbsp; My guess is no, but I just want to be extra careful given all the risk.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks a lot.

				I guess it is a good thing that I am suspicious of everything I read online. Turns out I did have the right URL after I found a similar warning on the clear net. Sometimes I have noticed that the Captcha(?) only shows 3 digits or 4 letters so I don&#039;t log in when that happens, may be just a glitch though.<br /><br />Thank you for this warning and the entire newbie section for that matter.

				heed the advice of the heros and moderators<br /><br />consume as much information as possible - almost any question you can think of has been asked and answered on these forums -- search carefully and you should be good to go -- there is no need to rush to 50 posts just so you can ask the question on the tip of your tongue or say something clever to the bigwhigs<br /><br />ingest the security protocols, practice leaving no trace - think like a cop and you&#039;d be suprised just how much of your behaviors could incriminate yourself<br /><br />its taken me more than a year to make my first post/contribution -- no need to rush into it<br /><br />be careful out there

				I have a link to it on an encrypted harddrive and I don&#039;t access SR any other way. Today I made the effort to memorize it by chunking. It may be intimidating because of the length, but if you just break it down in to smaller parts it really isn&#039;t bad. Just use your common sense and always look at the URL before clicking a link that&#039;s supposedly to the SR.

				Thanks, I wish I had read that 2 weeks ago as I&#039;m now 0.71 Bitcoins down:0!! <br />I&#039;m new on SR, only been here a couple of months, I did a couple of transactions, then didn&#039;t log in for a couple of weeks whilst waiting for it to arrive. Then I tried to log in &amp; got the repeat &#039;login failed&#039; message, I was researching the problem &amp; read this post, then I kept trying to login &amp; noticed that one of my failed logij attempts had only 3 numbers on the captcha &amp; no letters, &amp; I can&#039;t remember if I entered my login details or not as I tried so many times.......anyway, I tried doing what was advised, i.e. start a new account, but the same thing keeps happening, except it says &#039;you must enter a location&#039; even when I have entered my location.<br />I had 0.71 BTC approx. in my SR account as I was waiting for the last order to arrive (which still hasn&#039;t arrived after way too long, but I can&#039;t ask the vendor what&#039;s going on coz I can&#039;t login or create another account to contact SR help!!!)<br />If anyone has any advice for me, please let me know, as I&#039;m lost:0!

Many people have had their SR accounts hacked after using the same credentials and following the Atlantis phishing link mentioned above. Apparently the Atlantis phishing link does also create an account on the real Atlantis site.<br /><br />Your SR credentials should be unique to SR and be complex enough to avoid being compromised. <br /><br />DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE LINKS ON THE HIDDEN WIKI AND WIKIPEDIA.ORG TO ACCESS SR<br /><br />The only link that you should ever use to access SR is:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />Recently there has been a sharp increase in the number of cases of members reporting that they have been scammed by trying to access SR via fake URLs.<br /><br />Phishing is a technique used by hackers to trick you into giving them your password and PIN. It is a serious problem on hidden services because the URL is so hard to remember and can be imitated. Fake URLs are often advertised on the hidden wiki and wikipedia.org. If you registered on a fake site pretending to be Silk Road, your account will be compromised and your money stolen. We HIGHLY recommend that you change your PIN and password before making your first deposit. Don&#039;t be another victim, change your PIN! <br /><br />Please note that once your coins have been withdrawn there is nothing SR support can do to help recover them.<br /><br />If you have already fallen for this scam and are now only ready this after the fact you need to contact SR support on the main site as soon as possible. This will probably mean that you will need to create a new temporary account to do this, as you will undoubtedly have lost control of your account as the scammers will change your pass phrase. Please do not post in the forums until after you have contacted SR support as the moderators are unable to assist you beyond telling you to do what is stated above as all you will do is waste valuable time in having the issue investigated by SR support.<br /><br />The SR login page will never ask for your pin number, just your username, pass phrase and captcha. If for whatever reason you find yourself being asked to enter your pin at the login stage you should immediately be alerted to the fact that the link you are using is not trustworthy, NEVER ENTER YOUR SR PIN AT LOGIN.<br /><br />The time frames involved to have your pass phrase reset by SR support will mean that if you fall victim to this scam there will be nothing SR support can do in time to prevent your coins from being stolen.<br /><br />I strongly urge all new forum members to thoroughly research all of the information on the SR wiki before making any purchases. Investing the time to educate yourself on how to use SR as safely as possible will help you to avoid making some very costly mistakes.<br /><br />The link to the SR wiki is:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Stay safe<br /><br />SSBD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good stuff!

				Spartan,<br /><br />With the default search engine of Tor (Startpage), any .onion site that you find by searching through Startpage comes up as onion.to. (I&#039;m saying this from personal experience, seeing as it comes up like that for various other sites I go on aside from SR.)<br />A little bit of research led me to this site in case it can do a bit of informing for you. https://www.onion.to/<br />As the site I posted says, it is just a proxy. You can use this proxy to access .onion sites off of Tor. <br />Good eye though, you always need to be aware of the small things like that. Whoever said curiosity killed the cat has never gone on the underweb.<br />Probably because it wasn&#039;t around when that was first said.

				Hi, i think this has just happened to me. I logged on as usual and noticed a message from&nbsp; sr stating that due to phishing scams at the moment including my account i must change my password,&nbsp; my passphrase and pin no. asap then xfer any balance to temporary account. fortunately i only has 0.0655 btc left, but i cannot get back into my account now. So i guess ive been done over. What do you think?

So i guess ive been done over. What do you think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this sounds like a perfect example of phishing to me- i only get to SR by using a bookmark- or more easily just memorize the URL- also maybe a good idea not to keep btc in SR until you are ready to purchase-its easy to transfer to a pc wallet

				well now, wellwellnow, i guess the fact that phishing is still successful guarantees that is will continue to be used- but i agree those people suck - i sometimes wish i could punch someone in the face over the interweb, or maybe a three stooges eye poke- nyuk nyuk

				I think I&#039;ve been a stupid twat and fell for this... it appears I got locked out of my account but have sent a message to support detailing the problems. Now I play the waiting game...if there&#039;s nothing that can be done then I guess I&#039;ve simply learned a very harsh lesson. Here&#039;s hoping, though.
