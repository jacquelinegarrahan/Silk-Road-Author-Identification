				We will stop spamming when we have what we need. You would probably do the same. We are not proud of feeling this need to do it this way. Can imagine some may find it annoying. A tiny actual help from SR would change this all. So be pissed at them, or us, doesn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />Now this would be perfect for somebody who would&nbsp; feel the ability to copy paste this to the right subforum (drug safety).<br /><br />Copy paste from wwrong in newbie subforum:<br /><br />Person died almost instantly after snorting probably speed and ketamine at the same time. His falling caused both products which were sold by a vendor as ketamine and speed to make a mix on metal plating. Reaction was moving, smoking,melting and what looked like boiling. It became a never changing ultra stinky mess. Couldn&#039;t see it very clearly but if seen correctly, it solidified and then melted, over and over and over, while moving over the metal for a bit&nbsp; and the smell was very strong and strange. This is NO JOKE.<br />Read to know about problem: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108854.0<br /><br />Anyone out here who has some ketamine and amfetamines could mix just a few mgs to see if this reaction takes place. Small effort, ultimately helpful.<br /><br />Yes we can do all sorts of other stuff to figure this out ourselves, but we fear the worst so we would feel better when getting answers immediately. It will also help if different kinds of ketamine and amphetamines are used, dry and wet/medium and ultra wet. Or just ketamine with the liquid that their speed has been shipped with. Then we have different stories and can come to a conclusion.<br />Doing this ourselves will take a lot of time and effort and we can not afford to get new drugs at all because we must keep a secure low profile and we are not sure if we know enough about how to do that.<br />We do not even have time to deal with the loss of our dear friend yet. And asking for help on SR already takes up time. We use one account and let one person do this because we think it&#039;s best. We do talk in we because WE are friends and WE were going to have a nice time either with some probably good speed or ket, or look up first if usage at the same time is always lethal, or just not recommended.<br />In our experience almost all drugs can be mixed (while it is not healthy, it will not lead to immediate death).
