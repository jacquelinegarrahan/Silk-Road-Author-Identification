				Beware this guy is a possible scammer , noticed earlier he was asking for FE on sample products and had a huge listing of other products , he has completely dissapeared now. Buyer beware do not FE for new vendors ever!! No matter how good his offer may seem...!!!

				&nbsp;:-[Yeah he probably got me as his/her last scam victim. Had I bothered to check prior to FE I would have seen that their listings had vanished. I had queried the FE as i had impeccable stats and they politely replied that first buyers with them have to FE. <br />The only things that seem a bit odd to me is that for the few days they were listed their total orders displayed were about 7 to 10 and probably no more than 600 bucks. F--k they must be desperate! Also, they went to the trouble of replying to me explaining that they weren&#039;t in an express post drop off zone, why would they bother telling me that when they would be aware that earlier buyers much closer than my address would already be reporting them for non delivery. Lastly, I&#039;ve been scammed before and that vendor just went into stealth mode/no listing. What advantage do these dudes get by dropping off the vendor listings all together?<br />Any ideas any one?&nbsp;

				No worries guys , look out for one another on here and it will all be good. <br />You may have noticed that he said also that he stated that he dispatched orders via express mail on Friday , yet by Wednesday he had know feedback re : delivery!!

				DrMc are you indicating another scammer or still referring to AustSupply? I didn&#039;t notice that they wrote express post drop off on Fridays (but I can be a bit slack), however although they have obviously scammed me I am still puzzled why they went to the trouble to tell me that they couldn&#039;t meet my required ETA and actually suggested I should cancel.&nbsp; Had I opened their email earlier in the day (when it arrived) I would have cancelled and ordered elsewhere. It is definitely nonsensical for a scammer to advise that they can&#039;t meet an ETA and offer to cancel, yet that is what they did and i have the msgs still. They had nothing to gain by suggesting I should order else where........weird! <br />
