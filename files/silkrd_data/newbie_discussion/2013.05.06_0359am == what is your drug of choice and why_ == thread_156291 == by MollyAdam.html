				my drug of choice will have to be methylone. yes...methylone is an RC and has reports of shitty comedowns. but honestly i have never had one single bad thing happen to me on or after the use of methylone. i love it more than i like MDMA...<br />i also choose this drug because it does not show up on drug tests unless they test for it...which no one ever does :) i am getting a job in not long that requires a drug test at hire and also random drug tests. luckily they are only saliva tests...cheap ass fuckers. haha. most things only are traceable within up to 3 days...anything done a week before a test is not going to be found. methylone on the other hand will never be found on their shitty little tests :)

				Dissociatives, dude. Must be my brain chemistry or something becuase something trule magical and unprecedented happens when I take them. I couldn&#039;t even begin to describe the weird effects of K or MXE. It&#039;s like a cross between heroin and LSD. Or something.

				K is the gold standard. MXE is more of a delirious high, more like getting trashed. Not as unique. MXE is like getting so fucked up you&#039;re unconscious except there&#039;s very little in the way of subjective clouding of the consciousness. Then, you know, there&#039;s the detached, cool, romantic trippy elements of it. Go for K first, then see what else is out there if you like it.

				Cannabis. I love the relaxing feeling and the taste and smell. I only smoke dank and gag on regs or mids. I consider myself a connoisseur of bud. There are people who drink wine for the taste and the experience, that&#039;s how I feel about bud.

				Cannabis hands down. So relaxing, reflective, easy and profitable. It&#039;s odd, considering that it&#039;s also the drug which I&#039;ve had my worst experiences on, though overall the good times outweigh the bad. A close second would have to be boomers, though, because they are so deep and mind opening. They take you on a journey. And they&#039;re just pure fun. Though they do have some more negatives than weed, like an uncomfortable come up...<br /><br />I really haven&#039;t done that many drugs so here are the top 5 I&#039;m most interested to try:<br /><br />1. LSD<br />2. Mescaline<br />3. DMT<br />4. Ecstasy<br />5. Cocaine<br /><br />I&#039;ll most likely experience a number of these this summer, hopefully the top ones! ...got a great source here :)

				Ahaha cannabis really goes by the expression you can&#039;t have the rainbow without the rain. Feeling like a paranoid wreck huddled up in a ball worrying about your death on the rare occasion is the price we pay for all the good parts of the drug :p

				I love mdma the problem is always quality which since I discovered the Sr is less of an issue.

				The real advantage that powdered MDMA has is in fairly pure amounts you can measure out an appropriate dosage. A lot of times even clean pills have all sorts of varied dosages so god only knows how much you are taking at any one time (nornally not a lot)

				LSD<br />&nbsp;<br />It is one of the most spiritually and psychologically therapeutic experiences to be had for me; <br /><br />when an experience is over I feel totally satisfied waiting at least a month of several months before taking it again;<br /><br />taking it every several weeks actually reduces the desire to take other more destructive substances (note LSD has been shown to help alcoholics kick the habit);<br /><br />it&#039;s a great release and rejuvenation of energy for me: many times I feel as though a weight has been lifted; <br /><br />once LSD is laid on blotter, it cannot be cut (unless of course someone shittily adds some RC, but what I mean is that you can&#039;t stretch out the product to make more money once it&#039;s already been laid) so there is a sort of intrinsic necessity that when the LSD laid blotter is passing from chemist, to distributor, to dealers, you won&#039;t get LSD that&#039;s been cut to shit so some idiot can make a few extra bucks by stretching the product as happens with many substances, you&#039;re getting LSD that at worst is a little degraded since its a fragile molecule.<br /><br />in all it&#039;s intensity it is a safe, gentle molecule, physiologically speaking.<br /><br />Even bad trips are really the most therapeutic and important at times (as with most psychedelics).

				Hello,<br /><br />For me, psychedelics do the trick; I just love their mind-expanding properties. I tried DOM this weekend... powerful, but not my cup of tea. It has too much of an &quot;amphetamine-high&quot;. Cannabis would be, for me, the drug of choice: never had a &quot;bad-trip&quot; and never had any overall negative experiences. I&#039;ll also say what the biggest disappointment was for me: meth. Everyone bragged it up to the skies, but it was nothing. Really.<br /><br />Drugs of choice:<br />&nbsp; 1) Cannabis<br />&nbsp; 2) LSD<br />&nbsp; 3) DMT<br />&nbsp; 4) Heroin (I have only smoked it)<br />&nbsp; 5) Caffeine<br />&nbsp; 6) MDMA<br />&nbsp; 7) Cocaine (snorting it; I like the taste. I also enjoyed crack before, but now I don&#039;t like it anymore)<br />&nbsp; 8) Shrooms<br />&nbsp; 9) Benzos<br />10) GHB<br /><br />I have some research chemicals lying around which I eventually will come around to try.<br /><br />For the one wondering about the LSD dosage, I&#039;m quite a big guy (204cmx105kg), so when I take doses I have to take a bigger dose of everything. For example: I tried mescaline a while ago; they listed 500mg as heavy dose, so I took 300mg at first, but nothing happened. I redosed approx. 1h 30m later, with the remaining 200mg and I just felt mild effects. If I take acid, I need 300µg to feel the same effects that people achieve with ca. 150µg. For shrooms, the same... I need at least 6 grams of shrooms to get a desireable effect.<br /><br />Hope this helped.<br /><br />~Best regards

				Being a guy interested in shamanism, these are the drugs I always use:<br /><br />1. DMT (in all flavors, Ayahuasca etc.)<br />2. Tropanes (Datura or Henbane or Belladonna, ointment - it must be known how it is done, I&#039;ve researched in the witches ointment for most of my life and at last I was able to do it).<br />3. Shrooms<br />4. Salvia<br /><br />But I never use the plants recreationally, everyone of them has a purpose, depending on what I do. Datura is perfect for example for transformations or evocations, etc. DMT is perfect for OBEs or NDE, especially when you have to go to a specific place (you can do really everything - in terms of what is called the &quot;double&quot; or &quot;etheric body&quot; - with it, knowing how to use it ritually).

				1. Opiates. Particularly high quality heroin and oxycodone. They make me feel better than any other class of drugs I&#039;ve tried. The feeling I get after snorting a fat line after a month or two of sobriety is so good it beats anything else in life by far. It&#039;s like dying and going to heaven. I can&#039;t even imagine how intensely orgasmic it would be to IV the shit... Damn.<br /><br />2. Amphetamine. Very entertaining drug. Excellent for plowing mountains of homework, playing videogames and masturbating for 12 hours. I haven&#039;t tried methamphetamine, but I imagine that would be some awesome shit, considering how much I enjoy oldschool amphetamine. The downside to speed is that I can&#039;t stand the crash without some downers. I refuse to even use speed if I don&#039;t have benzos or opiates for when I wanna come down.

Well, dihydro-codeine. Krokodil is desomorphine that has been produced under terrible conditions and not been refined properly which is why it&#039;s so terrible for the body.

				from what I&#039;ve read Krokodil is made from cheap OTC codeine phosphate. Totally different to Dihydro. Can see how the effect would be similar if IV&#039;d tho.

				My DOC has got to be a mixture of opiates and cocaine. If i have an experienced IV user with me, a speedball made from high quality cocaine and oxycodone (dont be cheap, filter with a micron filter). Its like having ice and fire running through your veins in a torrent of orgasmic euphoria, rushing to a point you cannot believe. Both up, and down at the same time in a world where that makes sense. <br /><br />20 minutes later and you&#039;re just as doped up from the oxy as you would normally be, and then you can just keep railing coke and oxy if need be. Then come the end of the night usually you have no problem sleeping either.<br />Win/Win and a helluva ride. <br /><br />But obviously that shits addictive so i&#039;d advise against it. Also you have to be careful dosing, go easy on both. Lost a couple of&nbsp; &#039;&#039;acquaintances&quot; in such a manner. No biggie, stupid dope fiends a dead dope fiend despite how tragic.<br /><br />Next to that, it&#039;s top quality hash and bud. Nothing better than a tasty spliff, I can&#039;t even take anything else without at least one joint.<br />And then I love most drugs out there anyway ;) save a few peculiar past-times.<br /><br />Peace<br />Astrona

				I&#039;d go with LSD.<br /><br />Clean, euphoric, enlightening, easily my drug of choice. Little to no bodyload as opposed to most other tryptamines and phens and has both a recreational AND spiritual quality to it depending on dosage. Love the visual domain as well as the introspection and synesthesia. Helluva chemical.

				I enjoy the buffet but I have settled on the following 4 pillars which I rarely go without.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Weed&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Nuvigil (several times per week.&nbsp; Daily use reduces its effect), Clonazepam, Moderate Alcohol.&nbsp; This arsenal allows me to adapt to the needs of the day or stay up for the latest parties.&nbsp; If I find myself in an unenjoyable state, proper administration of one of the pillars will pull things back to center.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For fun I prefer the uppers and also occasionally hallucinogens including shrooms, salvia, and LSD but draw the line at Meth (too many responsibilities to go mad for 72+ hours which will happen with a decent stash)&nbsp; Mild amphetamines suit me well.&nbsp; I also stay away from the newer synthetics (not to knock them, but I&#039;ll leave the research up to younger people who are better wired.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really enjoy opiates.&nbsp; At one point I was hopelessly addicted to coke to the point of mainlining it and giving away everything I had.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found better alternatives (weed, nuvigil) but for some obscure reason people think they need coke to party so I encounter it now and then and occasionally grab some myself.&nbsp; These days I take it or leave it but it also doesn&#039;t have the same effect on me as it used to (The SRI effects of Nuvigil are likely behind this).&nbsp; I know with absolute certainty that drugs have and continue to inspire me to investigate things outside of my experience which in turn lead to a higher awareness and a more effective and aesthetic lifestyle.&nbsp; In the last 5 years I&#039;ve quit smoking, heavy drinking, tripled my salary, become vegan, learned 5+ new programming languages, listened to 1000&#039;s of hours of audio books while walking late at night.&nbsp; Rode 50,000+ miles on a decked out Harley. For me this is a lifetime commitment and despite legal considerations, I will continue to maintain the unalienable right to feed and exercise my brain .&nbsp; I find inspiration from those who remained true to this path until the end.&nbsp; Allister Crowley, Kerouac, Bukowski, Hunter S. T.,&nbsp; It&#039;s not about the drugs its about the freedom.
