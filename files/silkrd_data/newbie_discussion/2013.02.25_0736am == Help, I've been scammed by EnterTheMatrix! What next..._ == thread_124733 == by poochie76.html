			<dd class="postbody">
				There has been plenty of discussion around these forums about EnterTheMatrix and his dodgy practices over the last week but I&#039;m posting mine here, since it&#039;s the only place I can post.<br /><br />Basically, I&#039;ve made only two purchases (so I am a true noobie).&nbsp; The first was 5 LSD blotters from EtM which I received very quickly.&nbsp; I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the tabs which definitely didn&#039;t seem to add up to the advertised 250ug, but never-the-less I was ready to make another purchase because he offered me free postage.<br /><br />So on 18/02, I ordered my second purchase, a mini-candy flipping pack (5 LSD blotters &amp; 500mg of MDMA).&nbsp; He did request that I FE because it was my first purchase.&nbsp; I responded by saying it was not my first purchase and that I would not FE anyway from what I&#039;d read here.&nbsp; Now, a full 7 days on, having not received my package and getting no response from EtM, I searched the forums and it very quickly became clear that he&#039;d taken what he could and buggered off.<br /><br />Because I didn&#039;t FE, I assume I&#039;m good for my cash and Escrow will protect me as it should... but I have some other questions...<br /><br />The orders page is telling me that I must wait a further 4 days before moving to resolve.&nbsp; Normally this would be 100% fair, give the seller a good chance to deliver before making an issue of it.&nbsp; Problem is, I think that it&#039;s now VERY clear that he didn&#039;t send my package and I want my cash back so I can make another purchase.&nbsp; I really want to get a hold of some gear for this weekend and by this rate, that won&#039;t happen.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long it takes for the resolution to go through but I prob won&#039;t have my cash back in time to make the purchase that I want.<br /><br />Furthermore, as I understand, I will now have a tarnished refund history!&nbsp; With only 2 sales and 1 refund, I&#039;m not so sure that any other sellers will do business with&nbsp; me despite the fact that I&#039;m just an honest Joe trying to make and honest, be it illegal, transaction.<br /><br />Given that this is clearly an especially different situation to a normal resolution, is there some other process I can go through?&nbsp; Can I contact SR somehow to discuss the situation?&nbsp; How can I get my cash back ASAP?&nbsp; Am I better off ditching my account after getting my cash and starting again with a clean record...?

				Had the order moved into &#039;transit&#039; on the order page or was it still &#039;processing&#039; ?<br /><br />If the order had not been processed you should receive a 100% refund without having to do anything as SR support will cancel all of those automatically now the scam has been established. If the order was &#039;in transit&#039; you will need to take it through resolution and request a 100% refund which should also be granted without any issues.<br /><br />You are very lucky you refused to FE!<br /><br />+1

YOUR mistake was ordering with them AGAIN! Why do that? You&#039;ll get your money back, the powers that be know about ETM&#039;s tricks. <br /><br />His last bullshit attempt was going into the LSD AVenger&#039;s Thread saying he had a &quot;2nd batch&quot; of 200ug tabs and he would take care of EVERYONE that has the transaction number of the bunk LSD, lol, earlier today I heard he&#039;s now gone rouge....

				Awesome news,<br /><br />It seems a SR admin has stepped in and fixed everything up.&nbsp; I received a 100% refund and it went through as a successful transaction on my buyer history.<br /><br />So I would imagine that you&#039;ll get something similar raveplaya<br /><br />To Dread Pirate Roberts or which ever one of his faithful assistants got my cash back: &quot;You&#039;re a Fucking Legend.&quot;<br /><br />Bong on.

				Man that so sucks these guys give good vendors such a bad name and its what makes us all sketchy about buying. Its one thing if things fuck up because of the post or sent to wrong address. But not sending the product is inexcusable anyway thank you all for giving us the heads up and not just keeping this info to yourself. I am sure I speak for alot of us when I say we really appreciate it. hopefully your next deal goes better.

				Jeez sorry to hear so many people got stung so bad. Hope your future experience on the road goes better. Not everyone is a scammer and I am sure you will find good vendors. <br /><br />Good to hear some people did not FE so some of you can get refunded. <br /><br />Have a question for they buyers who stated the product was below average. How did you rate the vendor? <br /><br />If you gave a 5/5 that is,in part how people get high stats. It isn&#039;t your fault. It is just a flaw in the rating system. Most buyers don&#039;t accurately rate vendors because they are afraid other vendors won&#039;t work with them. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t far to the great vendors because their stats are no better than mediocre vendors. <br /><br />I do wish you luck on future dealings here. At least now you know not to FE and to research vendors before placing an order. <br /><br />Be safe&nbsp;

				It is always disappointing to see a vendor go Rogue.<br /><br />I have a question regarding what happens to a Demoted Vendor&#039;s Account.... which buttons will disappear?<br />As you&nbsp; may know, when you upgrade an account to Vendor Status, you instantly gain more Links and Buttons.<br />My assumption is that a Demoted Vendor instantly loses these buttons and may not even have access to<br />some of the required pages for re-ship or whatever your case may have needed at the time.<br />So if in your case, your Item is Processing.... you should be able to cancel and it wont effect your refund rate.<br />If he marked it in transit.... and by SR rules he deleted your shipping info.... There may not be anything that can be done<br />unless the x-vendor answers your messages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the nature of how Demoting a Vendor works.... there aren&#039;t many Human Beings who would continue<br />to send people&#039;s product out knowing that their Vendor account is Permanently dead and cannot be recovered.<br /><br />So, again.... unfortunately, due to the nature of Human Kind....<br />The x-vendor takes YOUR btc and transfers it to a new name, pays the Vendor Bond...<br />Then sends all leftover BTC to a bogus Buyer account.<br />Makes Listings for brand new product and sets the price to .03BTC.<br />Orders 300 separate transactions from himself.<br />Raises the price of his product to actual normal drug prices.<br />and will be vending again in 15 minutes with 100% feedback from 300 transactions.<br /><br />Newbies are EXTREMELY susceptible to this trick.<br />Just cause a vendor has 300 Transactions don&#039;t mean they were Real transactions.<br /><br />Follow your vendors in the forums.<br />Watch how they behave in the forums.

The main reason? He had a &quot;professional&quot; appeal, in that he conducted his online listings/store like a business as opposed to just some guy selling drugs. The prices were definitely high, but I looked at that as a sign of confidence that his/their product was better than some of the other cheaper, not-as-good looking products. A week after I purchased the gram of MDMA at around 12.5 BTC, the price dropped to around 7BTC (I believe in part due to competition from Neon Lights). <br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve been on here for nearly a month and have got a handful of transactions under my belt, I know that every vendor is as (un)reliable as the next when it comes to the quality of their product. Anyone can say that their stuff is 100% uncut premium lab grade pure, but at the end of the day as the consumer, you will never really know until you get it and test it.<br /><br />I just hope that other trusted vendors don&#039;t see this as a way to make some quick cash, and then start up again fresh with discounted prices, wash, rinse, repeat.

				^ regarding the fake reviews, I think it&#039;d be pretty obvious if a vendor who has been a member for less than a week has 300+ feedback as well as little to no fans. I guess what it comes down to is if you&#039;re unsure, jump on the forums and search their username. If you can&#039;t find a thread, start a new one and wait and see if anyone else has actually purchased from them!<br /><br />Edit: RE: TheAge article... Shit...

Which of course he said he did, but I&#039;d have to send funds directly as it wasn&#039;t a listing.<br />I didn&#039;t think anything of it as I thought he was doing me a solid.
