				Seems to be flurry of orders being received today after he said he posted out hundreds on Monday. So the signs look good and hopefully mine should arrive tomorrow.

				I&#039;m having trouble with CashMachine. I ordered from him a couple of weeks ago, asked for UN-recorded, next day delivery; it arrived within 3 days, and someone else had to sign for it. Not ideal, I thought, but the price, comms and packaging seemed fine so I decided to try again. <br /><br />I ordered the same again on the 14th may, expecting it to take 3 days again. <br /><br />On the 18th, he marked as In Transit, and I&#039;m still waiting. He hasnt read any of my messages since Sunday or Monday, and after Tuesday I&#039;m guilty of having swearwords in the subject matter so fair enough, my bad. But not having any weed to smoke even when I&#039;d allowed a whole week for his &quot;next-day delivery&quot; is pretty fucking annoying, and I&#039;m not the most balanced person at the best of times.<br /><br />I know he&#039;s had problems with SR crashing ( I messaged support on his behalf the couple of days after my second order, and got a thank you message from him in respopnse) and the recent updates to his page suggest theres more people than just me giving him shit about the delays we&#039;re having, but I really think he should reconsider the info on his page: &quot;all orders sent within 5 hrs..&quot; bollocks. <br />That&#039;s just setting up a queue of pissed off customers, and with prices like that it&#039;s going to be a long queue!

				Top vendor my ass&nbsp; &nbsp;, utter bullshit . <br /><br />Tons of people have still not received even though he claimed to have shipped all outstanding orders .<br /><br />Most of them have fe&#039;d , go figure&nbsp; .<br /><br />His&nbsp; listings are in vacation mode , most likely&nbsp; he was made to do this by support , until he pulls his shit together .<br /><br />He&#039;s fucked my week up&nbsp; , along with&nbsp; a lot of others
