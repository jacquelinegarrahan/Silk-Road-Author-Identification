				Hi guys.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />This is my very first post so please be gentle with me. Have been a silent reader on this forum for about 6 months. <br /><br />I have been searching Hash oil compatible with e-cig vaporizers and only come across stale, old threads from a few years ago.<br /><br />Which Vendors should I be looking at if I want to order some liquid that is compatible? <br /><br />Can anyone recommend any particular vaporizers or re-fillable e-cigs?<br /><br />Will it just work by mixing hash oil with the e-ciq liquid? (something in it that helps is vaporize?)<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Santa

				I&#039;m not going to be much help in answering your question but i did look into this a while back and was advised that E-cig&#039;s dont burn at a high enough temp to vaporize THC meaning they wouldn&#039;t work with hash oil. Was advised they wouldn&#039;t even work if you mixed has oil with E-cig liquid.<br /><br />I dont know if this is 100% correct or if anything has changed since i was looking but would also be very interested to find out!

				Ok thanks Luvs2Trip for your quick reply! :o<br /><br /><br />In that case, I put forward to the Road and it&#039;s users, What&#039;s the best hand-held Vaporizer to get?&nbsp; I want one that I can use in public so very similar to the e-cigs. Perhaps ones best for Hash oil and maybe ones for something more solid... pls share your experiences!<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />Santa

				If I recall correctly, then you have to make a sort of tincture using the base e-cig liquid for it to work in e-cigs (forgot what the liquid is called.) It&#039;s not too difficult a process, so I would suggest looking into and trying it yourself for such a specific, niche product.

				Type concentrates pen or hash oil pen in google.&nbsp; When you find one you like, google it with the word review.&nbsp; Then go to youtube and look it up and you will see it in action and more people reviewing it.&nbsp; There are a lot of pens on the market made for concentrates.

				quite easy to do this actually.<br /><br />Things you need.<br />1 bowl of water.<br />1 microwave<br />ammount of bho/whatever<br />PG/VG mixture. I use 50/50. some use higher pg ratio to vg. some use only vg.<br />1 glass container with a lid<br /><br />get your bowl of water and put in the microwave for 2 min. The water will most likely be boiling. let the water cool for a minute or so. get your glass container put the pg/vg mix in there and then add the bho(or what have you). use a paper clip to get the bho in there. dipping it over and over will make the oil fall off of the paper clip. if you are lazy just use a lighter to heat the paper clip. now put the cap on the mixture. Set the bottle in the bowl of close to boiling water. wait for it to cool down. once it has cooled down get your glass container and shake it while you heat the water again. now put the container back in and rinse and repeat until your hash is completely dissolved. <br /><br />Generally takes a long time. i did it for 3 hours yesterday and still was not able to get it completely disolved yet. i am having some slight issues getting it as potent as i want. but ill come back here and update.<br /><br />Also, i have read that you can use a crock pot on the lowest setting and just set it in that for 24 hours. then let it cool and you have your final product. but i dont know about this one since i have never done it
