				Yup you read it right<br /><br />I&#039;m withholding his name till he reads the PM I sent him. ------------------ Nvm his name should be known.<br /><br />He threatened to have my drop house raided, my family put in danger and to snitch on me.<br /><br />He also threatened to give every DEA, ATF, CIA, FBI, PO my personal information.<br /><br />These the kind of vendors you want?<br /><br />The first message he sends me is<br /><br />&quot;Terabithia(96) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might want to be careful who you mess with on SR Vendors look out for each other...I know of a couple vendors that have your address....SO FUCKING KNOCK IT OFF NOW!!!&quot;<br /><br />Then<br /><br />&quot;Terabithia(96) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VENDORS LOOK OUT FOR VENDORS I KNOW OF 2 THAT HAVE YOUR ADDRESS...YOU WANT TO TALK POLICE REPORTS FOOL....BECAREFUL WHO YOU FUCK WITH....THIS IS HONESTLY YOUR ONLY WARNING!!!! THEN WE WILL SEE WHO HAS PROBLEMS!!!!&quot;<br /><br />because I told him Moneypak wanted police reports because someone used my Moneypak card without my permission. <br /><br />Watch out for this guy, I already stopped using the old lady at my drop houses and I have no one at the Texas Apartment. <br /><br />I also rented a new place closer to work just in case this guy is serious. I&#039;m telling you right now you fuck with me you think informants don&#039;t get turned on and found do some google. It&#039;s not hard to find out if someone snitched on you especially easy to find out through your lawyer or records down the line. <br /><br />You&#039;re a silk road dealer and you&#039;re talking about setting people up, what kind of fucked up mind shit is that? <br /><br />The ONLY reason I came on this site is to get rid of gift cards I get for birthdays, graduation, and special occasions, turn them into BTC and get hardcore program and cash in mail but you come at me like I&#039;m dealing drugs or I&#039;m some junkie.<br /><br />I grew up in Chi-town down with the Nation moved to TX and still move from East to West monthly if you want to find me all you gotta do is ask but don&#039;t be people innocent people in danger that only receive packages for small amounts of money that shits not cool.<br /><br />Anyone feel free to chime in and how you feel about this, I just had to let steam out before I did something I shouldn&#039;t.

				Just to add no I didn&#039;t order shit from this website, I was suppose to get BTC coins in trade for my Moneypak but my Moneypaks were used and it was my fault for some reason when I don&#039;t even have a Mpak account or I wouldnt be fucking using SR to get cash in mail from Mpak transfers. Learn some common sense. <br /><br />The only reason the police report came up is because they said someone called in and tried to impersonate me to get a refund on the Moneypak card, no one said they are making one, they asked me to come in and make one, no I&#039;m not stupid and gonna show up to a fucking police station. I have a perfect record and you can test me if needed if anyone lives in the TX area and wants to see how real I am. So stop fucking with me and threatening old ladys you PMd me not even knowing the entire situation thinking you some OG coming at me sideways when I&#039;m nothing but respectful no matter how you treat me, its gods way.<br /><br />Peace, Cannabis.

				well, personally I for one would just prefer to not deal with this vendor at all. there are so many to choose from. threatening snitching isnt a joke and should not be arbitrarily thrown in to a conversation. If you would kindly pm me his vendor page i would appreciate it. I dont care who is right and who is wrong, who said what, or whose fault it is. If you threaten police action, i want nothing to do with you ever.

				hmm seems intense. i think i was thinking about trying this vendor in the past. username seems familiar&nbsp; :-\ dont really want to get involved with that<br />but this story seems a little confusing for me. why are they telling you to knock it off. were you saying something to piss them off. often theres 2 sides to every story

				I keep on seeing posts like these.... I don&#039;t understand either. i have never had any harsh words <br />exchanged with any vendors all of them were very pleasant to deal with.<br />might i ask you to post the whole convo? like the person before me said why are they telling you to<br />knock it off? knock what off? if your moneypack was screwed up than why couldn&#039;t some agreement <br />be made to rectify the situation?

				Ignore this one kiddies. I was just doing a search on posts related to Terabithia, and it&#039;s quite obvious this was a hoax by either a jealous vendor, or someone who can&#039;t even afford one stamp. <br /><br />There&#039;s no way that a transaction for BTC was ever started by Terabithia. <br /><br />Man, this can be a &#039;cut-throat&#039; type of business sometimes. <br /><br />I worked in the garment district of NYC in the mid &#039;80&#039;s. - I&#039;m up for the fight.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Terabithia is good people.

				I just made a small purchase from terabithia to feel her out and see if her product is good. Hope it gets in transit soon. Anyway, have had a few pms with her last week or so asking her if she could buy my mp. She said no, that it was too small an amount. She was very nice about it first, just by responding to pm, but she even referred me to another vendor that did buy my mp and didn&#039;t rip me off. So that&#039;s why i made a order today with her. So based on that good experience with her, and hopefully with the product when it arrives; i gotta say too sounds like there is definitely much more to the story than what&#039;s being told.
