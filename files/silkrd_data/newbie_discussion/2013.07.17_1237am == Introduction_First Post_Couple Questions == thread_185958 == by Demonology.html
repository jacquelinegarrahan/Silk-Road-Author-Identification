				Hey everybody! Been a buyer for over a year (16 purchases/0%refund/0%auto-finalize), and a lurker on the forums for even longer, so I thought I&#039;d finally join in on the fun here.<br /><br />Firstly, my buyer name is not similar to my forum-name whatsoever, this is in case I get a bit too friendly here and accidentally give away my province or something.<br /><br />I&#039;ll put my few questions I have at the bottom in case you feel like helping out but are too bored with any info about me.<br /><br />So about me, if anybody&#039;s curious!<br /><br />Drug repertoire. I might update this as I&#039;ve done quite a few and probably won&#039;t remember them all right now (though not nearly as many as much of the population, I&#039;m sure).<br />Caffeine<br />Ephedrine<br />Cannabis<br />LSA<br />LSD<br />Ecstasy (did not verify contents at the time)<br />Alcohol<br />DXM<br />Heroin<br />Cocaine<br />Clonazepam<br />Alprazolam<br />Amphetamine Salts<br />Methylphenidate<br />Psilocybin Mushrooms<br />Codeine<br />Dihydrocodeine<br />Hydrocodone<br />Oxycodone (only IR)<br />Tramadol<br />Propoxyphene<br />And a few others I&#039;m likely forgetting.<br /><br />My main interests, and also my inspiration for getting into drugs first-hand as well, is the psychology and neuroscience behind the method of actions of various drugs, and also the addiction that can happen as well. I&#039;m also very interested in the method and reasons behind profound spiritual experiences brought on by psychoactive substances, but this is something I have not studied formally.<br /><br />Few questions I&#039;ve built up over time; should make this thread a tad more worthwhile than just an introduction as well.<br /><br />1. Are there any problems from purchasing from two vendors at once, in the same checkout process? I&#039;ve never done this - not so much out of security, but more just because I like to include a short personalized &quot;Thank you&quot; message and let them know how I heard about them, usually from good reviews on the forums - but if all that is included is the (encrypted) address for the shipment, is there any security problem with checking out from two vendors at once? (Given that the address is encrypted using both of the vendors&#039; public keys.)<br /><br />2. What is the most secure file-hosting site for vendors that offer &quot;ebooks&quot; or movies for sale to use? I&#039;ve only seen a few speculations as to this end but have not seen many definitive answers in this area.<br /><br />Thanks again for reading this! Happy to finally take part in the forums!

				1. No, there is nothing wrong with that. As you said, you will obviously not be able to personalize the messages. When you pgp your addy, just add the other vendor(s) to the list.<br /><br />2.http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion/.- TorLibrary. Ebook archives.
