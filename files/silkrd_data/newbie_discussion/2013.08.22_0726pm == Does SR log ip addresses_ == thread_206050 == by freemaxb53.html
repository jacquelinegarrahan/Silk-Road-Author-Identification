				So I carelessly decided to login to personal accounts while on the Tor network (and having SR open).&nbsp; Now say by chance I was investigated, can I be found out by matching the ip I logged into SR with other websites that may have my personal information in it?<br /><br />Or does SR not keep any trace of IP addresses?<br /><br />This is a legitimate concern and I would only like advice from people with knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />Thanks.

				SR does not know your IP address, so there is nothing for SR to keep.<br /><br />The personal accounts you logged into whilst on Tor, if they cared to, could record the fact that you are an occasional Tor user. Which is also a fact that is recorded by your ISP anyway. <br /><br />In short, stop worrying. But in future, don&#039;t use Tor to access any websites that require you to log in, if they are websites who know who you are and you regularly visit them when browsing the web normally.

				well my question pertains to the anonymous ip given to you when connected to the tor network.&nbsp; does it not stay the same during your entire session? if you logged into a personal account and sr with this same ip wont both of them be logged, and with further investigation wouldn&#039;t the ip be able to be traced to both sites?<br /><br />i am a lil paranoid about this.&nbsp; i also see the function of ip logging in these posts (not that i am that concerned because i did log out and log back into tor after realizing my mistakes)

				well this would all assume that the personal account websites actually give the information out.&nbsp; it would be very rare case for someone to suspect that a certain person must have been using SR.&nbsp; But if the SR website was at all breached all the ips&#039; could be matched with other websites logged in with the same address.&nbsp; this is why i am a little paranoid.

				You only get an &quot;anonymous IP&quot; as you put it if you exit the Tor network. Your &quot;anonymous IP&quot; is the IP of the Tor exit point.<br /><br />Forget SR and hidden services for a second, and consider my Facebook example again.<br /><br />You start your Tor-enabled browser. It finds you a Tor entry point. You type www.facebook.com into the address bar. What happens now is that your request to visit facebook enters into the Tor network through the entry point, and then it passes through multiple points, each one encrypted. Each one of these points passes your request onto the next point, but they only know the previous point you came from, and the next one they send you on to. Eventually you leave the Tor network at an exit point. This exit point has an IP address, and it connects you to Facebook. Facebook then sends your data back to this exit point IP address, and it gets passed back through the Tor network, back to your original entry point, where it leaves the Tor network and finally makes its way back to you.<br /><br />In this example, Facebook sees your exit point IP address (this is what I think you&#039;re referring to as your &#039;anonymous IP address&#039;), but can&#039;t trace your path any further back than that. Your problem of course is that you logged in to Facebook. So it knows who you are, and it knows that you are an occasional Tor user.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now with a hidden service, you never leave the Tor network. You enter it in the same way as in my Facebook example. You are passed through multiple points. Each of these points can only see the previous one, and the next one in the journey. But the last point is SR, and you&#039;re still inside. SR can only see the last point in your journey, and it passes your data back to it. Your data then makes its way back to you.<br /><br />So SR does not see the same &#039;anonymous IP&#039; that Facebook sees, because there isn&#039;t an exit point when you&#039;re visiting SR.

				Watch this. Watch it in your normal browser.<br /><br />And yes, you can keep your Tor browser open and on this site whilst you&#039;re watching it.<br /><br />http://www.technologyreview.com/video/413186/how-tor-works/

				Ah.<br />So when visiting a public website via the tor network your IP is saved, but is the data cleared when exiting the TOR browser?<br />And when visiting a private website via the tor network your IP is never saved, but is the data cleared when exiting the TOR browser?

				DOES NOT MATTER!<br />There are many people using the same exit node at a time. No chance they will find out if the ip was in both cases used by the same person or if different tor users were just browsing different sites(since all info is heavily encrypted with tor).<br />Tor is technically unbeatable at this Point (well windows in combination with old firefox portable version was not, see google: verizon fbi darknet ).
