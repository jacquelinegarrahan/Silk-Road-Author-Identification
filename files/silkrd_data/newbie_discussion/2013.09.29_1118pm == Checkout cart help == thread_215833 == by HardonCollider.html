				Alright, I&#039;ve&nbsp; been accumulating btc with a very crappy video card while waiting to have enough money to get something worth it (total newb who was about to buy nvidia when it&#039;s obvious one has to use a top level radeon at the very least). So I&#039;ll start to mine seriously in 2 days, which is when I&#039;ll get the video card. I&#039;ve been adding things to my checkout cart to make a list of things I want.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why it says I need the whole amount before going forward, can&#039;t one just check what items they are ready to pay for? Or is that not how you make a list ? I don&#039;t want to wait up to x btc before getting an item worth x/10 for example.<br /><br />Bear with me heh, it just isn&#039;t like any place I&#039;ve done business before, obviously

				You can only order what you have the btc for and you need enough to cover everything in your cart.<br /><br />As you should be using pgp you should only be ordering from one vendor at a time

				Thanks for the additional info, but I just answered my own question.....for some reason I hadn&#039;t noticed the amount boxes with the 1&#039;s in each...I assume if I put 0 on every one of them I don&#039;t want yet and leave the 1 for the 1 transaction that I want to do right away then hit update things will be logical afterwards.<br /><br />Thanks for the fast reply.

				Just so you know, mining is VERY slow. The difficulty is very high these days and a single video card, no matter how good, just won&#039;t do it. I believe I read somewhere that because the difficulty is so high now, that you will not mine enough coins to cover the electricity that you will use to mine them. Even if you disregard that, it will take months, possibly years, to mine just 1 coin.

As for the mining thing, I know it is very slow, imagine doing it with a geforce gt 230 just for the hell of it (and of learning since a month) and I was told that a lot.. and the one I&#039;m going to get (and probably add a second one with crossfire right afterwards...the pool I&#039;m in seems to pay well enough), I&#039;ll be able to gain about 50 times more btc with the card I&#039;m getting, which according to my calculations will mean I&#039;ll be able to buy things, not 25btc worth of stuff at once but enough for a couple times a month of regularly priced stuff, which suits me. I&#039;m not in the btc thing to transform it into real money, I know I&#039;m late for that unless I get one of those asic things but even if i&#039;d buy one I&#039;d&nbsp; get it in 6 months or such if my understanding is right.<br /><br />p.s. : I get free electricity

				When you find listings you are interested in buying in the future, instead of adding to cart, bookmark them and they will show up on your welcome page, right under any favorite vendors you have added. <br /><br />This way, you can keep track of them (as long as the listings are up) and have your cart free to purchase items as you go.

				^^^THIS^^^<br />Bookmark them, don&#039;t add to cart.<br />Also, take your GPU and mine Litecoin, the difficulty is much lower and you can still make profit!
