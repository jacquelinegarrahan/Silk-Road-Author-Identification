				Since I&#039;m a newb and can only post here:<br /><br />Vendor: Reich<br /><br />Item: &quot;Ketamine&quot; (Her majesties finest)&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />With machine and organic assay this product was found to be 50% or less of product.<br /><br />New user and experienced user both experienced nasal clogging due to baby laxatives used as cut.<br /><br />Further experienced showed major gastric upset while we shat ourselves. <br /><br />It took about 200mg to &quot;taste&quot; the ketamine. It&#039;s been three and a half years since I used to put 3-5 grams of PURE 100% UNCUT ketamine into my body daily. <br /><br />Will be comparing this to other vendors to make sure. Didn&#039;t feel like running more than a melting point test on the crumbs that were left. Waste of time.<br /><br />Vendor offered some refund options if I reordered - frankly uninterested in experiencing anything from Reich in the future.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Reich failed to deliver a gram of ketamine to me in Aus. I recently had a dodgy meth import come through fine, so I suspect reich has selectively scammed me.

				Reich claims no reason to lie.<br /><br />I would not trust a vendor that does not assay their stock properly - <br />assumes you are at fault as the customer <br />&amp; ALSO changes their refund policy as they see fit.<br /><br /><br />I qualify for their refund policy but they are claiming their stock was above par (my ass!) and then discredits their customers.<br /><br />I have extensive experience with ketamine and this is just repulsive. (their stock and attitude)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK WITH THIS VENDOR!

				Sorry to hear that your Reich experience didn&#039;t work out but I have had only great experiences with Reich. <br /><br />They are my #1 go to seller on SR.<br /><br />The shipping is always fast, their stealth is incredible and top Ketamine and MDMA. <br />The Ketamine I have received on two different occasions is the strongest I&#039;ve ever had and I was floating for a very long time.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Seems like Reich is hit with bouts of ripping of newbs to hit quota. That sucks as a vendor. Taking business to another vendor. Cheaper, Melts on point (262!) and appears under other tests to be actually pure ketamine (99%). Reichs ketamine was primarily baby laxative. Unfortunate, but true.<br /><br />Bought ketamine nearly thousands of times. Reichs had some k in it, but not much.
