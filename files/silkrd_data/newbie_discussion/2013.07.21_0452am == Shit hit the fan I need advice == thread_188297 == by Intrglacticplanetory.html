				A pink slip was left on the door at my house. My parents went to pick up and sign for the package that was for me and it turned out to be an ounce of mids I ordered almost two months ago. This obviously is not fucking good. Please tell me what I can do. I&#039;m not a minor either.

				I may be wrong but i am sure if the package is in your name your parents are not able to sign for any package unless you authorize it....<br /><br />Fill in the blanks to your story so we can give advice...

				Maybe you should try not ordering drugs to your house if you live with your parents and they don&#039;t approve of your drug use? Or maybe, if you do that, at least bother to be there when the mail comes? Are you, like, 16?

				If OP got fucked by the cops he would not be able to post on silk road.<br /><br />He got caught by his parents. OP you are fucked just deal with the consequences.<br /><br />It&#039;s gonna be really hard to order from silk road again to your house, your parents will rip all packages apart forever until you move out.

				considering weed is becoming a &quot;accepted&quot; drug and I&#039;m sure his parents tried it at one point in life (college maybe) I think he will catch a little shit, but be ok.<br /><br />Why the slip to sign though? that part I don&#039;t understand.
