				Hi all<br /><br />Just thought you&#039;d appreciate a quick heads up.<br /><br />Not quite two months on SR and am about to hit 150 transactions - thanks so much!<br /><br />The Peruvian has almost sold out entirely - there&#039;s a few gs left - so while it&#039;s there come over...doubt it&#039;ll be around more than a day or so...<br /><br />My new delivery of prime Columbian has come...and is really very nice indeed, I can confirm from personal err...tests ;)<br /><br />Mellow but strong...nice sweet aroma. Straight off the block, no cuts - simply clean and direct to you.<br /><br />Be great to have anyone over - we supply small size too (0.25g for those who want to try a little first) but on all orders we promise exceptional customer service, top communications and obviously great product sent professionally, with your security in our minds...<br /><br />One last thing, for those interested in my gardening,..I am curing some amazing weed I grew myself...beautiful Kush strain I developed...boy is it going to be a beautiful high - it absolutely stinks (*in the good way!) I will list next week - only a small quantity so make sure you keep an eye out...<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Doc
