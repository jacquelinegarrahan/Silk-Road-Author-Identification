				Hello all,<br />As the subject line indicates this is my first day here. However, I cannot find a FAQ page. is there one? <br /><br />If not, hopefully some SR guru is feeling the charitable spirit today and can answer some questions for a lost traveler.<br /><br />1. Is it necessary to understand message encryption in order to conduct business on SR? If so, what is the best software that can walk a technologically inclined individual through that process?<br />2. How can I add Bitcoins to my SR account? <br /><br />I guess that&#039;s a good start, thanks in advance for your time.<br />3

				At the bottom right hand corner of any SR page there is a Wiki link next to the forum links. All your questions will be answered in there. Far as encryption, it gives the vendors a better sense of peace and mind when you do know how to do it but it&#039;s not necessary unless specified.

				Hey there,<br /><br />There is a Silk Road Wiki that includes a small FAQ.&nbsp; You can visit it by removing the excess paths from the URL in your browser currently (be sure to leave .onion there) and add &quot;/wiki&quot; to the end of it.&nbsp; So the address would be &quot;theurlinyourbar.onion/wiki&quot; (sans quotes, of course).&nbsp; There are also some pretty intensive/topic-specific FAQs on Reddit.<br /><br />1]&nbsp; It isn&#039;t necessary to conduct business, but for your safety I&#039;d say it&#039;s highly recommended.&nbsp; The alternative is sending your address to the vendor via an internet form.&nbsp; If anyone did happen to intercept this, or if the vendor doesn&#039;t delete their messages and gets busted, then you could potentially be at risk.&nbsp; Go ahead and Google &quot;GPG4Win&quot;.&nbsp; It should be the first website that comes up.&nbsp; There are tutorials all over the web (check YouTube if you are seriously technologically disabled) on how to use it.&nbsp; I suggest you use it.<br /><br />2]&nbsp; First, you need to access bitcoins.&nbsp; Thus far, I&#039;ve only done so using Bitfloor.&nbsp; My process was as follows: visit Bitfloor website, sign up, request amount to deposit, given date/account name/number/amount, go to Bank of America location, file for out-of-state deposit to pay bill, fill out the given account name/number/amount, deposit and wait.&nbsp; Once home, you&#039;ll have money in your account.&nbsp; You then need to purchase bitcoins with it from the Bitfloor website.&nbsp; Second, you have two choices: you can send these directly to your Silk Road account (SR gives you a wallet number to send to), or you can send them through other anonymous tumbling wallets to ensure anonymity.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest the second route through a few third party accounts (I use 3 Blockchain accounts--please note, doing so will cause you to loose a little extra bitcoin than expected as you must leave behind a small % to accommodate for recently inflation/bad algorithms in the seconds you spent transferring it).<br /><br />If you need a more detailed walk through or have any questions don&#039;t hesitate to send me a message!

				From what I&#039;ve seen,&nbsp; majority of vendors want your mailing info encrypted at least.&nbsp; It&#039;s&nbsp; really not hard to setup.&nbsp; Some great tutorials on&nbsp; here.&nbsp; List your OS and I&#039;ll find a link if you need.
