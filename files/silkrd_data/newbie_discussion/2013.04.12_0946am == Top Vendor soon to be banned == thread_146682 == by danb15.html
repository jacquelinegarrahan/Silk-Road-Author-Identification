				Anyone scammed by TwoMuch needs to use the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on their profile and in the comments, let Support know that you suspect he was already banned under a different username.

				So are we saying stay away from &quot;bulldog&quot; and &quot;italy&quot;?? Because I was just looking into ordering from bulldog his communication has been great with me so far. Or is it &quot;buldog&quot; different spelling? different vendor?? I&#039;m so confused.

Best MDPV i received per SR till now. Like i said before, HE is NUMERO UNO! And everybody who talks sh*t about him and starts crying because<br />its just BAD LUCK ! He does what ever he can, to ship everything safe and stealth. And i could never imagine that he tries to rip someone of, for a few Euros. He is trying to built honest relationships and he is doing his job absolutely accurate and im always happy to deal with him .<br /><br />So when there ever is a problem, talk to him first before giving him a bad grade<br />and writing false statements about him !!<br /><br />A happy customer thumbs up.

				Hi everybody!<br /><br />&nbsp;This is just my second post to the forum, I wrote the first one yesterday. I registered here about five months ago, same time when I did register to the Road. The count to fifty just seems too much for me, so I haven&#039;t even started before yesterday. But now I&#039;ve started and I&#039;m taking those fifty heavy steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;After I saw these topics last night, I tought that I have to come here and share my knowledge of this bedlam here at the forum, where I don&#039;t visit too often. Got to get a grip on that.<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway, I&#039;ve ordered from ITALY and from BULLDOGISTHEBOSS, from both of&#039;em about five times. Everything came through and as ordered. First time from both I ordered a sample of H. Both were average, so nowadays I get the &quot;thing&quot; from somewhere else. After that I have ordered MDPV. Still, even I like more the tan version(it just kicks me harder), but I got people around me who like this pale gear more. So I help those people, cause they are important for me. Everything went just fine for me with this vendors. The amounts were quite small, no bigger orders. Both of&#039;em were really friendly and helpful in my opinion. Their service was cheap, fast, and 100% to goal. What could be better? Maybe the point that when (from now on, just:) BULLDOG finally got some tan on his hands like he promised a few weeks earlier that he will get it soon. Guess what he did? He PM&#039;d me and sent a free sample. About a G. I think it took to his character when I earlier said that his gear is not the best. And that mediterranean character in my opinion is what shooks some people in his style to answer some things that are said about him. Someone could see that as a sign of guilt. But I would be angry too if somebody says that kind of things about me, and I&#039;m usually the cool guy. :)<br /><br />Then last night just out of the woods I bumped to these few topics here on the forum and I was just &quot;WHAAAAT&quot;?!?&nbsp; These nice two fellows I&#039;ve dealt with separately seems to be A guy. One guy, says many people. So, I tought. What if they are the same guy? That doesn&#039;t change my experience I have had with them. I was like remembering that ITALY&#039;s english was very poor compared with BULLDOGguys english. I might be wrong, ITALY was a looong time ago and I would have to log in to the road to go check the levels of their english when written. And I just don&#039;t have the energy to open a new tab and all that just now. haha<br /><br />&nbsp;Is there really some people who have had bad experiences with ITALY or with BULLDOG? The OP, if I remember it right, asked if BULLDOG is trustworthy, and does somebody have something bad to say about him? I&#039;m not sure if I was on the ball with all those replys 100% but I really don&#039;t remember anybody saying that they had. Somebody, anybody, speak!!<br /><br />&nbsp;This what I am &quot;writing&quot; is just my experience, somebody may have different point of view. If you have some doubts, go buy from somewhere else, the road is full of vendors. If you have bad experiences say it out loud, here. Thanks.<br /><br />This one goes back to meditate. Peaceful sunday to each and everyone of you.<br /><br />basta<br /><br />PS Now when I red my writing at once I saw couple of misunderstandings. Like what I said about the op, that was on another topic. I&#039;ve red three of&#039;em higgledy-piggledy, not one at a time. Don&#039;t let those kind of trifles confuse you too much.

				Hi comrades !<br /><br />I dont know anything about drug ape, this rx??-guy or the vendor called Italy. But what i know definately is, that BULDOGISTHEBOSS , former called BULDOG,&nbsp; is an absolute honest vendor who<br />does everything to make his customers happy. He even helped me in a case where i got scammed by vendor Antonexx(!?) and did what he could and talked to the support when the support didnt replied to<br />my mails. I made several orders from buldog, smaller and bigger ones beginning from the first time i read his name on SR. He never stole a cent or fooled my in any other way.<br />Now , im awaiting an order from him two where i even FEd him in advance without any hesitating. No doubt, he is the MAN from ITALY no matter what any haters in here say.<br />If u bann him we would loose one of the most honest guys in here. U could order 1kg or more of whatever split in several packages and everyone will show up, for sure.<br />Even if i wanted to, i couldnt say something bad bout him. Really nothing. I ordered from germany many times and everytime it was a pleasure for me.<br />The products never got worse, his products got better and better on every single order. And i tried his coke,hash, weed , heroin and WILL try his mdpv as soon as it arrives.<br />the comunication with him was always very polite and worth AAA+++. Not even my faults and sometimes my stupidity were a problem for him as he was always helpfull.<br />So please write what ever u want about any vendors.. but not bout buldog. SR would be a much more sad place without him.<br />And i cant say i would FE in advance for any other vendors. and definately not when doing business worth a few thousands euros. with BULDOG, i can.<br />Service, products, messaging, packaging, quantity and the care he takes on his customers are and will be always AAAAA+++++.<br />Please everbody, who made similar experiences with BULDOG, write what u think about this and help our good friend and fratello from italy.<br />I think, its just a try of other angry vendors trying to kick him out of business, but his way of making business will win for sure.<br /><br />Fratello, keep up your unique work and dont give up the fight against your foolish haters. U got many fans and happy customers enough for sure.<br /><br />FORZA BULDOG!<br /><br />Kindest regards from Germany

				&nbsp;What the...&nbsp; ...Somebody must have burned the whole fucking fuse panel here. The smoke is so thick that it&#039;s a miracle that the sprinklers didn&#039;t threw some water on us.<br /><br />&nbsp;Have you even read what I wrote earlier, with a thought? I&#039;ve been on the road about five months. I don&#039;t know anything about some things that happened a year ago. And it&#039;s really not my job to go dig the forums, isn&#039;t it those job who are insecure about him? I&#039;ve said earlier and I say it now: I&#039;m talking just with my own knowledge and experience of this vendor. Should I think that he is guilty until proved otherwise? If there is so much proof and the whole situation is so widely in everybodys awareness here I just wonder that how this vendor could still be here?? I just wonder and wonder, and I just don&#039;t get it?!?<br /><br />&nbsp; Maybe I just wonder too much..? You asking am I high, hell yeah. I&#039;m always high, I was high when I did born. Oh, I remember that day so well. My mother had left me a note on the table that there is some burgers in the fridge if your hungry. No seriously, I have been sober for almost a month now. I&#039;m doing a study on the behavior at the forum full of addicts. It&#039;s going to be my master&#039;s thesis. Or something like that. <br /><br />It&#039;s good that you support and guide the new members, of course. I didn&#039;t want to be guided, I wanted to learn myself. And look what happened.I got scammed, for one time out of some 25-30 orders. Big european vendor scammed me, I ain&#039;t saying no names you know who you are. So, I moved on. Took a lesson. It&#039;s not the whole world that I don&#039;t have a perfect track record, like it seems to be for someones. So fucking what that I have refund rate 1.0 something%, I don&#039;t care. I can still buy stuff if I want. <br /><br />People, go out. Live a little, climb a tree, fly a kite, do something. Don&#039;t just hang here on the forums trying to prove something to others or to yourselves. There&#039;s a whole world outside, or so the big boys told me. I&#039;ll go and see if I&#039;ll find it.<br /><br />By for now, I really don&#039;t have energy to bark here about this same thing and building just more this negative energy that there already is too much.<br /><br />Peace&#039;n&#039;love to everybody,<br />Basta<br /><br />(screw you guys, I&#039;m going home) ;)

The least you could of done is do it in increments 100/100/100/200 or just bought things from multiple vendors.<br /><br />Edit: For some reason I thought you said 500 Bitcoins. Same concept still applies though, that really sucks that someone would ruin their reputation over $500 though, and maybe some other small scams.

				speaking of crappy product and shitty vendors, situation:<br />Product ordered 10 pink pills for 1.74 btc<br />Totally bunk, no effects whatsoever!<br />Vendor does offer a 50% refund or sample pk of another kind<br />I say I&#039;ll accept the refund grudgingly<br />However, Mercury only sends me .37 btc he says because btc has risen in value<br />Does anyone else think this is bullshit. <br /><br />Also claims the USD is worth more than the Euro<br />I mean i&#039;m not an economist or anything but last I checked it was the other way around<br />anyway just wanted to get some feedback<br />
