				It is clear that his good reviews are him givimg himelf good reviews. Not one ofbhis buyers have recieved their product. Go back a couple of pages on his reviews and look at the updates. ALEXANDER68 will rip you off and that is why he asks you to fe. He is newer than some of the newbs on here and is scamming evetybody. I see that some people bought from him even today. Please dont give money to this scammer. Its vendors like him that give SR a bad name. We dont need scammers on SR. Makes it harder for real vendors to earn a buck. Im just trying to warn you as well as help SR become a healthy place. Well as healthy as a site like this can be.&nbsp; We are all here for a reason and we dont need scammers messing it up for everybody

				i find it hilarious how many people are FE for this guy.&nbsp; he&#039;s scamming SR right in&nbsp; front of your eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just because he sends you a 3 paragraph long answer (as he did for me)&nbsp; &nbsp;doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s legit.&nbsp; &nbsp;anyone whose new .... cannot ask for FE and has no right to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why would they need you to FE?&nbsp; to get their coins faster?&nbsp; &nbsp;no one has even gotten their product from this asshole yet and people are continuing to buy.....<br /><br /><br />fucking check yourselves before you wreck yourselves.&nbsp; thsi guys a fucking asshole

				Thanks for the info guys communication is the key <br /><br />Hopefully this Alexander68 gets banned soon and&nbsp; has to fork out another start up fee<br /><br />Silk road is such a wonderful place we can all vote with our&nbsp; wallets <br /><br />The reality is FE does actually work with a select group of&nbsp; elite vendors<br /><br />
