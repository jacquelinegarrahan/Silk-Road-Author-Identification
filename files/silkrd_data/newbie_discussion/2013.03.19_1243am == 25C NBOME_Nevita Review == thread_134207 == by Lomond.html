				Firstly, I would like to thank Nevita, for their excellent service and great steath. <br />Ok, time for a trip report. I have had these before, which were purchased off a UK website, and were advertised at 500ug. I worked my way up to 1.5mg, which gave me a good trip. <br />My evening starts at 19:00. I had decided to go straight for two blotters, which are advertised at 800ug each.<br /><br />00:00 - 00:20<br />I placed two blotters between my gum and upper lip, and leave them there for approximately 20 minutes, my lip started to get a little numb and tingly. At this point I started to feel a little euphoric, smiling most of the time, and starting to get very excited. <br />00:20 - 0045<br />Throughout this period I choose some uplifting music to play, sat down and relaxed. The intensity of the trip was getting stronger and stronger, it felt great. <br />00:45 - 02:30<br />I never expected it to come on so strong (as I had regularly taken only 100ug less on my previous trips). This is when the visuals started, awesome visuals might I add. Everything in my sight seemed to be breathing, bending or swirling, simultaneously. I decided to put my old favourite trip music on, namely Shpongle&#039;s Nothing Lasts but Nothing is Lost. At this point I laid down and closed my eyes. The visuals started to get more intense, started to look like I was sat in a spaceship in the playstation game Wipeout (I have had similar visuals before). The visuals were full of detail but were flying past me at such a speed, that I found it hard to really take any of it on board. Every new track on the album came with a new scenery. I thoroughly enjoyed just laying there with my eyes closed. I then started to have thoughts about food, which was a little surprising as I had never felt like eating during my previous experiences with this compound. <br />02:30 - 05:00<br />I decided I would cook some chorizo. I found this quite difficult, as there was very little in my kitchen that wasn&#039;t moving in some way. I managed to cook it without injuring myself (which I was very proud of). The chorizo tasted great. I think I shall prepare something cold for the next time, and keep away from sharp knives. <br />I put some more music on, and returned to my favourite spot on the sofa, and laid down, closed my eyes and enjoyed more visuals for another couple of hours, they start to slow down. <br />05:00 - 07:00<br />The visuals have gradually tailed off, but I am still feeling very happy. A change of music was in order, something a little more relaxing, so I put in Aphex Twin&#039;s Selected Ambient Works album, which felt just the right pace. When the album finished, I decided to go to bed. I got comfortable very easily, closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. <br /><br />I had a good 8 hours sleep, in which I had many dreams, I remembered most of the details of, when I awoke. <br />The next day I was still feeling very happy. <br /><br />My conclusion is that these are quality blotters. I look forward to my next experience. <br /><br />Once again I would like to thank Nevita, for their excellent product and all round service. You have a customer for life. <br /><br />Peace. <br /><br />Lomond.

				Yes, the vendor is Nevita. Their stats have gone down slightly over the last few weeks, but don&#039;t let that worry you, as they have just moved premises and expanded their selection of products, so things a little crazy at the moment. The product is brilliant, you won&#039;t be disappointed.
