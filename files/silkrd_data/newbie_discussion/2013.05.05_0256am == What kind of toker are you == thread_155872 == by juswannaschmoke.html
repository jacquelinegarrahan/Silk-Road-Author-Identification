				I hate how people prejudge &quot;drug&quot; users. I don&#039;t think many people know how &quot;normal&quot; a lot of smokers are. While in highschool I believed all sterotypes about pot heads and ALL of the misinformation. I drank heavily in my first years of college and my grades suffered. When I began toking as a 2nd year sophomore...it changed my life. I was easier going, more studious, productive, I found the love of my life, a fellow toking beauty. After we graduated we were teachers me highschool, her elementary. We got baked as we graded papers and were the best teachers ours student could ask for. We are heavily involved in local politics and larger campaigns, I was even an elected official. Recently I moved to DC and work on the Hill. Thats how I found this place, I hate the seedy drug world and didnt have my college connects anymore. Its great to feel like I&#039;m in an online dispensary. <br /><br />No one outside of my wishes know that I partake in my miraculous medicines, I&#039;m an Undercover Dabber but no one would ever guess it. Not my students or their parents who adored me, not my bosses, I have many. <br /><br />Anyway, what kind of toker are you all? Do you break the mold or follow the stereotypes?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The stereotyped stoner is quickly moving out of the mainstream picture. As more states are making it easier and &quot;acceptable&quot; to smoke weed, people are getting their illusions shattered as they discover who exactly likes to toke. The older generations seem to be clinging to it a little more strongly but most of the younger generations know too many people from too many walks of life for it to be that clear cut.<br /><br />Personally, I love weed and have been a heavy toker on and off for 20 years or so. Even when I was hitting it the hardest I was still going to college and working full-time while also raising a damn good kid. Rather than a beer at the end of the day, I just liked to smoke a bowl (or 2 or 3). I&#039;ve shocked a few people over the years after they discovered my &quot;habit&quot; because I don&#039;t fit into their idea of lazy ass hippie stoner.

				Currently in college, and I smoke weed almost every day. It serves as a reward system for me rather than having consequences on my work. I use it as an incentive to getting my work done, in that I tell myself I cannot smoke until all my work for that day is finished. It&#039;s a way to wind down and relax and relieve all that stress that builds up.

				i agree about the fact that raising a kid is more fun for the kid. I mean you are more laid back, no stress, playful parent. So yeah, i love to play with my child and toking has not reduced it.

				Regular smoker since 18, daily smoker since 19-20ish if I remember right. Now 27, switched over too vaporizing about 8months ago, it&#039;s only been a positive influence for me. I work a corporate/office job, one young daughter, doesn&#039;t stop me from doing anything I need to.

				^^^ So what is your &quot;adult&quot; vice. Marijuana is one of natures most powerful natural medicines. I did some harder stuff in college, at 26 now I do some harder stuff once in a while at a tailgate or something with college buddies. I&#039;ve let go of the other drugs because they are not medicinal for me, just party enhancers...dont like partying too much now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I too have a young daughter and use my medicine as an incentive to get all of my work done. I&#039;ve switched over to vaping too out of a Micro G and Volcano.&nbsp; I love this service because I finally have access to concentrates which are non existent in the deep South. If I wanted too, I could make some money from flipping some of this stuff but thats just not my scene. <br /><br />Hopefully we will have some type of policy that would allow us in non green states to come out of the shadows. I hate feeling like a felon when I am trying to acquire meds.

				Sorry guys, I&#039;m your good ole guitar playing hippy stoner. But even I break the norm, I&#039;m smart and don&#039;t hang out with just potheads. About half the people I know are surprised I smoke when they find out, and the other half think I come lout of the womb smelling of dank, bong in hand.
