				<br />not in my experience but it is a lot better than suboxone but don&#039;t buy that shit here its insane how much money they want. If you have to I guess but unless you&#039;re on Methadone or heavy H user you&#039;d probably get more relief from a good indica and a Kpin but I just say someone selling 2mg pins for over $9 bucks!!!&nbsp; son&#039;t pay more than 4 and that still pricy.&nbsp; I&#039;d avoid most pill purchases as many vendors are preying on ignorance... 8.99 for a vicoden??&nbsp; lol&nbsp; 9 bucks for a bar or Kpin is the vendors right but it&#039;s a joke, shop around. <br /><br />sorry a bit off-topic I was just a bit thrown by the thought of buying $20+ subutex when for your case it is totaly not needed. much better choices available..<br />Gabapentin is very useful for discomfort and WD&#039;s, not a controlled substance, and dirt cheap off SR because DR&#039;s are not in the least afraid to prescribe it. I paid few quid for 90 300mg caps at the pharmacy.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d still go with a very potent indica, and if your not into benzo&#039;s keep it that way as there is no withdrawl in the world worse than that or the long term benzo user.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Oh god I can&#039;t imagine why anyone would voluntarily take buprenorphine. <br /><br />Admittedly I was taking it as an alternative to methadone for a couple of years but I can assure you that even if you do not have tolerance to opiates it does not produce anything remotely like an opiate high. <br /><br />Another weird feature is that increasing the dose does nothing to increase any effect due its properties as an opiate agonist-antagonist. Whatever you do, never take buprenorphine with any opiate and definitely do not take it if you have a habit because it causes immediate, extremely unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. <br /><br />Speaking as someone who has used and abused bupe as much as possible I would recommend staying as far away from it as possible. The only thing it is good for is pain.
