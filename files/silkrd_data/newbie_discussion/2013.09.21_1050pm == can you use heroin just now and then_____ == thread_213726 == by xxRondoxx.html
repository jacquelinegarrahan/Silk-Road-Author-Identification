				I believe that in life, you can have the power to control your own urges and the actions you want to take. I&#039;m a bit of a psychonaut and love testing my body and seeing how it affects me, but unless you are one of the few that can truly take a drug and are not bothered by the urge to abuse it, I suggest you not think about doing heroin. If you really feel like you don&#039;t have an addictive personality, then go for it. It&#039;s really up to you. I&#039;ve done meth, coke, and other drugs that are considered addictive, but once I tried it a couple times, I got bored of it and moved on.

				I wouldn&#039;t wish heroin addiction to my worst enemy. I&#039;ve seen countless very strong willed people become consumed by it, it&#039;s a terrible thing to witness. So i would advise against it, then again you&#039;re free to do as you please. Just know what you&#039;re getting yourself into

				Wait until you are 60 or something. Then you don&#039;t have that much to loose if it goes wrong. :-)

				Here&#039;s my belief .......... There is not one drug that will fuck everybody, but just about everybody has a drug which can fuck them.<br /><br />Beware the drug you just LOVE, its the one your most likely to abuse.<br /><br />For most in society that drug is booze ... :P.

				Love opinions of people who have never tried it,&nbsp; OP go for it try it but remember the first time you have its amazing the best drug there is but you&nbsp; will never gett that feeling again no matter how hard you try. So do it, do it once enjoy it and move on ask any addict they will tell you its not the same ever again, but that first time.....wow

				I&#039;ve been thinking about the same thing. I definitely consider myself a psychonaut and have tried a range of things. And I mean, you can&#039;t help but be curious about H. I kinda wanna travel to India or something on vacation and try it. That way, I wouldn&#039;t associate it with my normal life here at home. But I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s that easy haha.

				Ive tried virtually everything except H.&nbsp; I had some once when I was in college and my gf at the time told me if I tried it she would break up with me because a friend of hers OD&#039;d on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s such an iffy drug.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always told myself if I make it to 90 years old and I still haven&#039;t tried it, then what the fuck... ;)

				i use it just once a week, sometimes once a fortnight. but that&#039;s after having a 15 year severe heroin addiction and just getting to the point where i just can&#039;t do that everyday addiction thing anymore. i&#039;m too old for that now and i now find that doing it now and then is much more enjoyable than doing it everyday. <br /><br />that said there is something to be said for the addict life. its no good if you&#039;re a materialistic person and having a house and money is important to you, then heroin addiction will be a complete nightmare. but if not then the heroin lifestyle is actually full of excitement and you have many great times and laughs along the way. of course there is the downside of fiending/rattling but i was pretty adapt at making quick cash so they were always minimal for me. plus you can keep that to a minimum by keeping a supply of methadone or some other strong opiate pills for emergencies. plus people say that heroin is never as good as your first time. well try rattling all day and then finally getting that bag of gear placed in your hand, just that feeling of taking hold of it in your hand is heaven. then when you go and dose it up its awesome, that shere relief, there&#039;s nothing quite like it, going from pure pain and suffering to calm gentle pure pleasure in just a few moments. <br /><br />the heroin lifestyle is absolute living on a knife edge, violence, jail, robbing and all manner of crazy shit on a day to day basis. but if you can handle that then its actually a very intense and interesting experience. i actually would be very reluctant to change the last 20 years that i done.

				Heroin now and then, if you can&#039;t get it very easily, I think isn&#039;t a big deal. I wouldn&#039;t encourage it, but it&#039;s not so bad if you can have some self-control. Just don&#039;t ever stick a needle in your arm. I wish I could go back and never have done it. Shooting up is definitely not something you can just do for fun every now and then. It becomes an obsession, even when you can&#039;t do it.
