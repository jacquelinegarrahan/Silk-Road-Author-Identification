They are using Silk Road to do it -which is bad for legitimate users of SR.

				Krebs reports on security/cyber crime and some of the Russians have quite a disliking for how he exposes some of the things they are up to (articles often contain private messages between them/personal details). Check out his previous articles, it will explain it more. Worth reading if you are into IT security.

				This could be a very elaborate trick. If he set all this up, notified the cops, then open the package, took half of it, and let the cops take the rest, thinking it was the whole package.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what happened at all, but someone could play this trick.
