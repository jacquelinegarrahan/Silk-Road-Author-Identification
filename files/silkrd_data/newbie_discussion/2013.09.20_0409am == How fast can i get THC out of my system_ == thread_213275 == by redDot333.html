				It depends on hundreds of things buddy, that you should not post here<br /><br />it depends on:<br />&nbsp;<br />body weight:<br />amount smoked:<br />calorie intake:<br />foods you eat: junk food, fried chicken, rice, etc<br />age:<br />Method of smoking:<br />liquid intake:<br />exercise:<br />fitness level:<br />use of other substances:<br /><br />it depends on a lot of things that YOU DO NOT WANT TO POST IN HERE, cause it could be used to ID you, ill just say if you&#039;re a skinny guy 100-130 LBS, THC will stay in your system for about 1 week and a few days after smoking for 6 days, drink lots of gatorade, make sure your pee isnt clear or they lower the test levels and youll fail,<br /><br /><br />PM ME WITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

				THC has a very high variability in this regard. Generally it&#039;s a couple weeks to even a month and a half. A good friend of mine had not smoked a single joint in two months, but she went to jail because on the day she had court she failed her drug test by a slim margin. Obviously, it didn&#039;t help her case. You can speed up the process by jogging, eating a low fat diet and, well, not smoking any more cannabis. THC is fat soluble, which means that if you have more body fat it&#039;ll take more time for you to lower your THC level to the point where you would pass a test. Drug testing kits can easily be purchased at your local dollar tree or similar stores to give yourself an idea of whether or not you&#039;d be able to pass. It&#039;s worth noting that tests utilizing your hair would come up positive if you&#039;ve smoked at any point in time you&#039;ve been growing your hair, but it&#039;s very rarely done. I&#039;m assuming that you&#039;re more concerned about a piss test, but it&#039;s definitely worth giving a heads up about.

				Make sure you sweat. Running, jogging,&nbsp; exercising. Niacin pills, GNC cranberry concentrate, vitamins and shit tons of water should dilute it real good.

				I would advise against trying to sweat it out after reading this article (clearweb): http://scienceblog.com/66608/stoners-beware-exercising-might-lead-to-a-positive-drug-test<br /><br />It appears that exercise moves THC out of fat cells into the bloodstream.

				Like others have mentioned the time will vary greatly and can&#039;t be nailed down to an exact day, week, or even month.&nbsp; However, I will be in the same boat as you coming up and have to take a piss test.&nbsp; I plan on having lots of THC in my system at the time of testing and passing.&nbsp; How you ask?&nbsp; Synthetic Urine!&nbsp; Here:<br /><br />(CLEARNET WARNING) http://www.quickfixurine.com/<br /><br />At first it seemed too good to be true to me.&nbsp; But after I&#039;ve read a lot of forums I see that this stuff actually works!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had first hand experience yet and am a little nervous about ordering and using it.&nbsp; However, I won&#039;t be doing a piss test where someone watches me so I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll be easy to pull off.&nbsp; If anyone here has used this stuff successfully or knows someone that has, please feel free to share your experience.&nbsp;

				Unfortunately only time buddy, I&#039;ve tried everything and the methods are getting more advanced yearly it seems. Fluids and exercise as said will help don&#039;t listen to fads.

				Used quick fix and the sister product &quot;urine luck&quot; many times.&nbsp; Not sure why it works so well, I don&#039;t f&#039;ing work for these companies, but it does work well. Last time I tried, I put half a urine luck cap mixed with tap water in an afrin bottle, made the nozzle a bit bigger with a needle, and strapped&nbsp; the thing to my leg with a &quot;instant hand warmer&quot; and an ace bandage.&nbsp; Waited a hour, filled out the &quot;WARNING- SUBSTITUTION IS A FELONY!&quot; forms at the drs office, squeezed the junk in the cup. Bam- no detectable drugs- instant job. <br /><br />Known many others who have done the same.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, FWIW, with light use drug tests can be passed quite soon after use, 3 days or so for one use unless you have a high body fat %.&nbsp; Me and others have smoked every weekend on probation and still passed the test every friday.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The worst part by far is paranoia. <br /><br /><br />Also watch out for water intoxication, I drank 4 or so gallons of water for a test one time and was very, very, very intoxicated.

				you can buy very good test kits on ebay, nhs approved. <br /><br />I had a test in work that I knew was coming and it took me 45 days to get clean, I smoke everyday and am a large guy, slow metabolism. <br /><br />if you know you are going to be tested and dont have time to get clean the best you can do is drink as much water as you can on the morning of the test and piss at least twice before the test.<br /><br />when you give a sample fill the cup from mid stream not the first stream.<br /><br />good luck.
