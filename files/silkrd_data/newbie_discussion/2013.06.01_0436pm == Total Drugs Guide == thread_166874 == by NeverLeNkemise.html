				I have come up with An Idea.<br />A FULL drugs guide created by the members of this forum, especially those who really know their niches.<br />Everything from weed to computer duster and psychedelics that are still totally unresearched.<br />We could include interviews with vendors, picture guides and user experiences.<br />Is it possible?<br />All input is appreciated.<br />I&#039;ll start with an article on weed for the total beginner that should be finished in a few hours.

				Seriously, before you out more energy into this - search for erowid on the net - it has about 10 years worth of the kind of info you are talking about. Not shooting your idea down - just don&#039;t want you to expend energy on something that has been done very well already.

				Thanks for the input guys/gals!<br />I&#039;ve thought of a wiki, and have seen guides on the internet such as Erowid, but a full guide in pdf that could be printed and with reliable info for all types of users, from first time smokers, to those needing information in a medical application is what I&#039;m aiming for.<br />I am currently organizing sections and subsections. This is what I&#039;ve come up so far:<br /><br />Substance types:<br />-Depressants<br />-Stimulants<br />-Opioids<br />-Psychedelics<br />-Other<br /><br />Within these, all the main substances, or families for psychedelics?<br /><br />And under each substance:<br />-Background<br />-History<br />-Chemical synthesis/other chemical info<br />-Effects<br />-Doseage/Timescale[+comedown]/Method of application<br />-Side effects/Dangers/Prevention<br />-Addiction [mental/physical]<br />-Legal status<br />-Cocktails/redosing<br />-Similar substances<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked through Erowid, Bluelight, and many others. Yet they lack a structured consistency as well as an inconvenient structure [for me at least]<br />The guides are mostly for the intermediate users, and there&#039;s little advanced info, or guides for total beginners...<br />Thanks again for any inputs, I&#039;m just one user, but together this might be possible.

				I get that the info is already out there...<br />But I&#039;ve put my reasons for making this up, no point in reminding me of the existing resources...<br />Most of the info out there is like I said, for the intermediate user, and unverifiable...<br />The aim is to create a useable guide for ALL, that is reliable, and uses input from the expert users and narcotic geniuses.<br />If anyone has a lot of knowledge/experience on any specific substance, it&#039;d be great for you to &#039;put your name down&#039;.<br />Thanks again.

				The only issue I see with your idea of a pdf guide is how long it would be. There are so many different drugs, drug combinations, and difference in opinions that this guide would be at least a few hundred pages. The reason sites like erowid and bluelight work is that they can be navigated and searched to find the information you are looking for. Creating what is essentially a guide book to drugs seems like a step backward from the current sources of information.<br /><br />

				It could be a good Idea, erowid doesn&#039;t have info on every substance. You could also put what vendors are are good to get them from, since it&#039;d mostly be a silkroad thing right? Having things like an effect list for each substance would make it more complete than erowid, which only has one for more mainstream drugs. You&#039;d need to put it in the form of a wiki I think... A book would be way too big and a little annoying to use. At least all info would be in one place, but it&#039;d be a ton of work. I&#039;d take all info erowid has and just add what it doesn&#039;t have to make it easier.

Which isn&#039;t completely a downside, as even if they were, it is always smart to vet information from multiple sources.<br /><br /><br />I think the other important aspects of us having our own will go a long way to further strengthening OUR communities&#039; self sufficiency. And it will provide a resource that is comprised of user experiences and drug info of the actual substances here on SR. This is a very important part, especially when dealing with substances that are highly dose dependent or will likely have varying analogs across different communities. The info and especially the user experiences should carry more weight as the providers of each should be more readily at hand to further vet or correct info as it is provided.<br /><br />Plus, did I mention, it will be OURS, the SR community&#039;s! =)<br /><br />I&#039;m game for it and would be happy to contribute towards some of the more research heavy side of some common substances.<br /><br />-Codemonkey
