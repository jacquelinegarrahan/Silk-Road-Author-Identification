				Say I ordered some hash or ketamine from overseas, and customs seize it what would happen? And should I do nothing but deny I ordered such substance? I mean, it cannot be proven. But in the media they claim to arrest people for importing these substances and &quot;they face up to life imprisonment and a $825,000 fine.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m also curious if that person was a minor?<br /><br />Just some general newb questions out of curiosity. :)

				Quantity is the major factor. 500mg or 500kg?<br /><br />Seems there isn&#039;t a set rule. No love letter, but not likely to see SWAT team kick your door in either.<br /><br />Recreational Ket didn&#039;t exist when I was a minor. Not a good idea to Mum and Dads house put it that way.<br /><br />/grumble

				Well, in my mind a minor lives with their parents.<br /><br />You likely lose your drugs if it gets stopped.<br /><br />If they report it to the cops you get a visit and you deny.<br /><br />I often err on the side of less than 2g just cos shitty dealing laws for over 2g (think thats most states but Tassie these days).<br /><br />If its K, not like you don&#039;t have plenty of domestic options atm, is it really worth the risk for the saving?

				The following could help you:<br />1. Use a fake name and abandoned mailbox. Just look around and you could find such mailbox not far from your daily routes.<br />2. Ask the vendor to send goods in simple business envelope without tracking to receive it into the mailbox without your signature.<br /><br />Good luck!

YOU won&#039;t get caught probably but you have a much better chance of not getting your drugs too.

				Tellemetree, you&#039;re right, but it depends on local post office staff. For example, in my country nobody gives a fuck if the name is real. But, of course, this fact couldn&#039;t be extrapolated to any post service.

				About two years back I had an incoming package containing 100 Xanax 2mg seized by Australian Customs.<br /><br />I died a thousand deaths when I got a letter from AQIS (Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service aka Customs) informing me that they had intercepted a package addressed to me containing said Xanax, and that it was against the law to receive Schedule 4 medications without prescription.<br /><br />In that case, however, they said that if I could provide a prescription within 30 days they would release the pills, otherwise they would be held.<br /><br />Can&#039;t remember exactly what else, but there was something about how they would not be pressing charges as it was a first offense, but if it happens again ... if I can find that letter I will post the text, or highlights thereof.

				Not quite sure what the drill is for illicit street drugs though.<br />Would they send a letter?<br /><br />I would hazard a guess that there may be a range of variables determining how heavily they would come down on you - such as the quantity of drugs seized as well as the type.<br /><br />In NSW the threshold for a traffickable quantity of Heroin and Cocaine is 5g, but I am not sure about limits for other substances ... if you were arrested with this amount it would be the difference between a charge of possession and a charge of supply, so I imagine the same principle applies to receiving by mail, etc.

				Don&#039;t order from overseas, only from aussie vendors and get it mailed to your place in your name.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been doing this for ages as it raises the least suspicion.&nbsp; Never go over 2gs either...

				As to &quot;what happens ...&quot; I would say that Customs will keep your package of contraband and then decide whether or not to charge you with importation.<br /><br />and &quot;what should I do ... &quot; - if the worst comes to the worst and you end up facing charges, remember that you are under no obligation to answer any questions and the &quot;burden of proof&quot; lies with the authorities ...<br /><br />&quot;To convict you of a Importing or exporting a border controlled drug or plant charge, the police must prove each of the following matters beyond a reasonable doubt:<br />You import or export a substance; and<br />The substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and<br />The quantity imported or exported is a marketable/commercial quantity.&quot;<br /><br />Should the worst happen, say nothing, politely decline to answer questions and seek legal advice immediately.
