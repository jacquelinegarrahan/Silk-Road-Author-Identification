				I have used MDPV heavily for a year and have not gone psychotic once. I sometimes get paranoid to unhealthy levels when I overdo the sleep deprivation and lack of food but thats it. I&#039;ve insufflated it, vaporized it, and taken it orally and have gone to a court of law for jury duty while on MDPV. Its cheaper, much cheaper, than amphetmines, but I would wager to say its also more toxic. But to get Adderall or worse Dexedrine I&#039;d be forking out $500 a month -- and thats what I&#039;d pay for a legit script since I lack insurance. And thats if I found a pharmacy that has any in stock. Its easier to find a pharmacy carrying 1 kilogram drums of cocaine [for making into custom topical creams -- Coke is schedule II for topical outpatient RX and is easier to fill than racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. And dont even mention Desoxyn aka dextromethamphetamine]<br /><br />Does it pose more side effects than amphetamines? Yes. <br /><br />Can it fuck you over if you eyeball the dose, even with a pre-existing NDRI tolerance? Absolutely.<br /><br />You need a lab grade scale to dose this safely..<br /><br />It needs something fatty to dissolve properly in. Like milk. Keep that in mind if dosing orally. Benzos wont help you if you&#039;ve gone psychotic from it. Clonidine taken BEFORE MDPV OCCASIONALLY [as its a blood pressure medicine and causes SERIOUS PHYSICAL DEPENDENCY like all BP drugs] can offset some of the dysphoric side effects. But you cant binge on MDPV... you have to eat you have to sleep. You will go psychotic if you try to binge on it. Its wonderful if you use it therapeutically. But it has an initial euphoria that has a freebase cocaine-like fiendishness if you try to chase the initial high... the key to not injuring yourself with MDPV is education as to how super potent NDRI stimulants work. Look at Merck&#039;s entry on 2-Desoxypipradol and work your way down to Pyyrovalerine&#039;s patents and the limited scientific work on MDPV [hint: exclude the words &quot;bath salts&quot; in your search on Lexis-Nexis to filter out the bullshit] <br /><br />MDPV blows amphetamines out of the water in terms of medicinal functional use. But if you dont respect its power, it will potentially bring out pre-existing dispositions towards schizophrenic disorders and frank hallucinations that can result in PTSD. <br /><br />And I wouldnt be surprised if it damages heart valves if used heavily on a daily basis. Remember, only the parent compound Pyyrovalerone was tested in humans in clinical trials -- and marketed briefly as an anorectic after the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous [DEA&#039;s original name] restricted Dexedrine, Benzedrine, and Methedrine [amphetamine salts, or methamphetamine salts] and Dexamyl [Amps mixed with delayed release Barbiturates or Miltown-like compounds, and for 3 months a product that had 15mg Methamphetamine racemic and 400mg Delayed release methaqualone - designed to release 12 hours after swallowing]<br /><br /><br />MDPV has immense therapeutic benefit.... but I would not recommend using it for pure recreation. Uppers shouldnt be used often for recreation, and should stay occasional. Use for creativity boosting is documented among Bebop Jazz movement, and mathematicians including ones who worked for the Department of War pre-Vietnam. A lot of technology we use wouldnt exist if it werent for great scholars jacked up on stimulants. But they arent healthy, dont kid yourself.<br /><br />

				Okay I got to ask first of all I&#039;m not about flaming people on the boards that&#039;s not what I&#039;m about at all. Ordered from him in the past no problems but is anyone else having trouble with j1m1th1ng its been like 4 days and despite what he said my order still hasn&#039;t shipped. I practically begged him to try and get it out before the weekend but it looks like that&#039;s not gonna happen either.That&#039;s like all the money I have so I left hanging.&nbsp; Its a simple order nothing complicated and I hate the fact that the cancel button is greyed out in matters like this cause it leaves the buyer stuck and unable to do anything till the time period expires.

				(note- not directed at any one particular person, just my input on jimthing, reliability of shipping with USPS lately, and MDPV)<br /><br />fwiw i&#039;ve ordered from jimthing at least once for MDPV. i take it by various means of ingestion and MDPV is not an easy drug to adulterate inert substances with without seriously altering its scent [anyone who insufflates any drug ending in *valerone knows what scent I speak of...] and causing discoloration, or theoretically causing much quicker oxidization into non-psychoactive byproducts [always store MDPV as airtight as you can, longterm storage should be in amber glass with oxygen removed completely and properly sealed] <br /><br />USPS is unreliable lately and i always give vendors at least 2 7 day extensions [even if they dont communicate] before thining about a reship or refund -- and if they have a DCN showing it going to my locale, I take on all the loss since its not their fault if the carrier lose it. But if theres no DCN i always wait it out and give the benefit of the doubt until I have just cause to doubt the veracity of the vendor. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had some vendors [who arent in business anymore and were on clearnet] who sold me some serotonin-heavy MDMA-like drug that smelled like coconut oil when vaporized/combusted and did nothing psychoactively when inhaled -- but behaved like one of the shitty 4-MMC and Methylone unscheduled replacements making the rounds (and trust me, when you expect a clean NDRI stimulant and get an MDMA entactogenic experience instead, it is extremely annoying especially when it causes you to miss employment related deadlines due to a whole sleepless night of fucking around and the next day a serotonin-starved fatigue of running on empty.. srsly.. dont sell something as something else.. even if its not as extreme as fentanyl as diamorphine / 2c-e as LSD (if theres a hell, those in both those 2 groups will hopefully see it).. but MDPV has a very unique appearance [and I have hundreds of crystalline substances -- psychoactive and otherwise in my photographic memory -- MDPV does not play well with anything but fatty liquids such as milk -- you should avoid keeping it in plastic for too long -- fine for transport but not longterm storage... a glass bottle is best... it can corrode tin -- stick it in an empty altoids tin for 1 month if you dont believe me.. GLASS. But again the plastic used in food seals is fine for *temporary* (ie, vendor --&gt; you transport time) containment -- and all compounds that feature the pyrrolidine based sour milk aroma that MDPV and to a lesser extent a-PVP has need to sealed properly or they will breakdown from oxidization into non-psychoactive, and quite toxic [if inhaled] compounds (oral use mitigates this issue if worried -- just like impurities in racemic street methamphetamine are offset by the liver and stomach acid filtering out some byproducts)<br /><br /><br />I have no complaints about jimthing&#039;s speed, methods, or quality of product. In my experience if you are getting the fuckover I would be shocked if its heavily cut MDPV ... as it would take considerable time and effort to cut MDPV without rendering it inert -- in some ways its more fragile as a molecule than LSD when it comes to abrasion against foreign matter [dust can even ruin MDPV] or exposure to oxygen. At least it doesnt mind light though ;) <br /><br />To vendors who are provisioning MDPV from Chinese outlets, I would recommend that you have your sources ensure the final product is as an HCl salt [failure to specify will often result in mixed bases, or freebase when prospecting new orders vs ready to ship] <br /><br />Slightly OT... I&#039;d love to see 2-DPMP vendors pop up. I know many are scared to sell it because of its 20-40 hour duration, but this might sound harsh.. you cant fix stupid. People are going to injure themselves from failing to research drugs they take either way, and its nobody&#039;s fault but the user&#039;s if they are too cheap/lazy to invest in a calibratable milligram scale, and a 1mg-1g weight set and taking time to understand 1. How pharmaceuticals work through insufflation, ingestion (and how prodrugs work w/ liver enzymes), the melting point if wanting to &quot;smoke&quot; (vaporize -- smoke is to combust a chemical -- which means you burnt it too hot) and a basic pharmacological profile eg, is it an SNDRI? NDRI? GABA-ergic? NMDA dissociative? 5HT-2A hallucinogen? A PNS/CNS deliriant (feelsbadman)?<br /><br />But again, no complaints from my 1 or 2 orders from jimthing.&nbsp; MDPV is feast or famine.. either you got MDPV as pure as it was from the Chinese factory (or it will be dead obvious it was tampered with) or it will be obvious in initial physical inspection of the powder that its not MDPV, especially if its a *drone type drug (note the coconut sun lotion smell too) <br /><br />And the reason &quot;tan MDPV&quot; isnt carried anymore is because tan MDPV is impure. Rarely does a crystalline substance with a high purity have any color darker than yellow. Tan MDPV is a myth with no evidence to justify its status. But who knows, its not as if someone will conduct a double blind placebo-proof test to know for sure. Personally, i&#039;ll stick to less color = higher purity. <br /><br />MDPV is also sometimes hygroscopic -- it will clump up if stored improperly in a humid environment -- but this is not an indication of tampering necessarily, and its still above 95% purity in this state. Dont use tin based razors to chop for insufflation. <br /><br />I also used drpvmd, qd, chembros, and a couple others. chembros didnt arrive but he/she refunded me squarely so no complaints or accusation, the others the MDPV was always prompt and as expected. FWIW, i doubt any postal inspectors or customs are using canines trained to detect MDPV, but it should definitely be vac sealed to protect its integrity. MDPV is probably easier than amphetamines to train an animal to detect, but its a niche drug and the USPS at least is barely solvent with their few cannabis and cocaine detection canines they don&#039;t have money to waste for recent Schedule I&#039;s ... one exception maybe is the UAE or perhaps Australia due to both nation&#039;s hard on against SR and off-label drug use (and UAE being notorious for using trillion dollar tech to find half a microgram of cannabis plant material under someone&#039;s shoe in an airport).<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with the physical properties of MDPV, the scent, the hygroscopic nature, etc. Any regular user of MDPV can tell if its MDPV or not in seconds after removing it from a container -- literally. <br /><br />If people knew widely of MDPV&#039;s potential, it would be three times more expensive than methamphetamine -- but since it requires responsible harm reductive use to avoid psychological injury, it will always be a niche psychostimulant, but watch as Pfizer or some other big drug company patents some extended release form -- it will be the first ADHD treatment in 1.25mg and up doses. Obviously.. IR forms cant be patented lol. <br /><br />Know why people go psychotic from MDPV? Because they overdose. They snort it thinking its as potent as meth or coke and get ten times the effects -- and thats when dysphoria overcomes euphoria and therapy. Heart attacks are rarer than you think from a one-off stim OD, but psychological panic attacks, and prolonged psychotic states are well documented. Weigh it before you take it for drugs like MDPV, and everyone is different, one 120lb male may feel the same on 2mg as another 120lb male feels from 10mg -- MDPV has some pharmacodynamics that go beyond NDRI so even with a pre-existing NDRI tolerance you should start low -- if using non-recreationally, use the lowest dose for your desired effect to sidestep habituation. Theories are it agonizes nicotinic receptors possibly, and others yet to be documented. Also numerous peripheral nervous system functions like adrenal glands -- you cant equate it to amphetamines fully because its a unique drug with effects of its own that someday will be well documented but for now its safe to assume its more than your typical NDRI drug -- both CNS and PNS. <br /><br />There&#039;s many drugs including phenethylamine based hallucinogens that must be carefully weighed to avoid injury, $150 for a used lab scale is a small investment to protect from embarassment when your loved ones must retrieve you from the psych ward, or the ER as you are being administered benzos to treat serotonin syndrome. Do us all a favor.. and be responsible and dont give the news media more crap to use to demagogue self-medicating / recreational drug users.
