				So I am new to silk road but ive been reading alot and getting to know how to use it and browsing some of the vendors.<br />All i can say this site is amazing but&nbsp; i just have a simple question about domestic vs international orders.<br /><br />Since Domestic orders dont go through customs arent they alott safer than international orders which obviously go through customs...<br />It seems that the customs section ofd the delivery is the only real risky part and considering domesctic orders dont have to deal with that arent they almost 100% safe or at least much safer then IN orders.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am really asking this because iam scared to make any orders from another country I might stick to ONLY domestic orders which seems almost 100% safe..<br /><br />What do you guys think how much safer is one than the other really ?<br /><br />

				Domestic is def much safer and reliable. Way higher chance of getting a love letter with intl. Although intl letters make it over the blue sea everyday ;) just pick a wise vendor and you&#039;ll be set.

				From 17 orders (9 different vendors), only one order didn&#039;t came (I also did not receive any notification or love letter), but reship came. All 17 orders were international and most of them were bulk. I think it&#039;s pretty safe.

				I equate ordering international and dealing with Customs ability to open any package for any reason to allowing the police to come into your home without a search warrant. <br /><br />If you want to try it, go ahead.&nbsp; But know it&#039;s like playing Russian roulette. Even if a package is 110% discreet and stealth, there&#039;s a 50/50 chance that Customs may open it just for the fuck of it.

				Research, I know it seems like 99% of you do not know how to do such things.&nbsp; To me if a vendor has lots of product never came,received refund. His methods are shitty and I don&#039;t order. If they have only one or two, and those say to AU, I am usa so I am a okay. Usa a dog needs to scent your mail pretty much. I have had int packs with a hole pokeed threw, but I have the ability to do research and pick reliable vendors and have no trouble. One gram of hash from nederlands never came, niether did letter. Selle who I forget refunded all but shipping costs, more than his page said he would do. So even that was an unerving but pleasant experience. It sometimes sucks when yoiu have to pay maybe a hundred dollars or more extra. But what would you pay for your freedom???&nbsp; &nbsp;All in all is all we are.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone else have that blotter from the early 2000&#039;s. Best blotter ever had, well mayan calendars then these.&nbsp; &nbsp;
