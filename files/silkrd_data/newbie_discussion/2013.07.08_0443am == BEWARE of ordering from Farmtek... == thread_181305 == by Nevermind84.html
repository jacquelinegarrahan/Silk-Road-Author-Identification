				I placed an order with him for an oz of Sour Diesel on July 2.&nbsp; As of midnight on July 8, he still has not done anything with it at all.&nbsp; And he hasn&#039;t responded to my inquiries even though he&#039;s been on SR every day since I placed the order.&nbsp; He also read my message asking about it and decided to ignore it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame when a vendor can&#039;t be bothered to take 5 seconds to respond to a message.&nbsp; It&#039;s also unacceptable and SLACK to let four shipping days go by and not ship an order.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can understand if he had some type of emergency going on or something, but he hasn&#039;t posted anything on his profile.&nbsp; I needed to have this order by July 9, and he really fucked me up now.&nbsp; Also, he doesn&#039;t use PGP, but I ordered from him anyway like an idiot.&nbsp; NEVER AGAIN.&nbsp; I cancelled the order.&nbsp;

				I have messaged him on SR and replied to posts of his here on the forums, and never received a reply. <br /><br />Simply for the shitty customer service, fuck him. Will never order from him.
