				Hey,<br />I listen to Buyers Guide Stuff and did everything with GNU and so on. In all fairness i will not yet tell the name of the vendor. But he canceld my order without saying the reason, that is not fair, so how i can be better at the stuff if no one help me. Because the famous vendor wrote on his profile, i case of newbies or questions just pm me and will find a solution....So what is going on?

				Sounds like you&#039;re new, that&#039;s what the problem is.<br /><br />You need to find a vendor that&#039;s willing to work with noobs with no stats/history.&nbsp; Do your research, you&#039;ll find one.<br /><br />And next time, I&#039;d PM them first so you don&#039;t lose money on your orders being canceled.

				I always wonder why people who are legitimately upset with a vendor will refuse to list their name. If I felt a vendor treated me unfairly and I wasn&#039;t able to work it out directly with them, I would mention it in the forums. I do not mean go out and vendor bash but honestly describe the problem. <br /><br />If people are having problems with vendors that are unresolvable but do not state their names how will it help the rest of us?

				I am absolutley new, but i have enough good bitcoins i paid the correct price...but still the problem is, that he will not say what the problem is with an pm, although he mentioned on his vendor profile...<br />So i orderd again the same product to give him an another chance, i would even pay a little bonus, but i need his view, if still ignores more in that in case without saying anything...i say his name.....<br />I want just a normal trade like the others :)

				I get it... I understand.&nbsp; But some of these vendors get really busy... and constantly PM&#039;ing them etc. might just piss them off.<br /><br />If the vendor wanted to discuss this with you, they would have PM&#039;d or answered you imo.
