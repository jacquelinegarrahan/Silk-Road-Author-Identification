				Hello friends <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m a relatively unheard of vendor.<br />It&#039;s late and i&#039;m half asleep so i&#039;m not going to sound as articulate as I usually like to but...<br />i&#039;m looking for tips on how to convert btc to usd, seems like its getting harder and harder but i need to figure this out inorder to keep things flowing. I know of peer to peer transfers, but we&#039;ve been getting about 100 BTC each week and it hasnt been easy to find someone who will buy that many off of us.&nbsp; Please share any advice if you have any. God bless

				Bitcoin-otc might be an option. If you have market prices you should be able to sell BTC pretty well there.<br /><br />Might want to trade that for paypal (on anonymous account with a dedicated VPS IP for example) or Ukash and the like (that can be later on be used to get a virtual credit card)....<br /><br />Another option would be to create a &quot;bitcoin for cash&quot; onion site where you&#039;d sell directly btc for cash in the mail. Or to sell on sites like localbitcoin and accept only cash....<br /><br />The BTC would need to be moved around before though, to cut as much as possible any link with SR..<br /><br />Good luck :)

				Please note that any misspells are intentional...<br /><br />&nbsp;If the B T C exchange is located in the US or divvying out Unies Staes Dolar&nbsp; Then it is about to become almost impossible to create a clean approach to getting your money quickly. We as a vendor have begun to encounter this already. The GOV is about to put a major bottleneck on the flow from&nbsp; Bit - coin to U - S - D. There are options but they cost money to complete. <br /><br />Feel free to contact us about some our ideas on this topic. <br /><br />and<br /><br />Check out some of our services for spending your bit - coin to live. after all we work in a bit - coin world so live like it. We are beginning more and more systems like this each week.

				Regardless of what you convert to, when it becomes legal tender recognized by any (standard) financial institution, you have to pay attention to one, very, very specific fact:<br /><br />Tax evasion is the easiest way for any LE to get you.<br /><br />If you produce an income, where items are purchased, that does not adequately get taxed, you will get caught. It is only a matter of time. The IRS has had a lot of practice since Capone.
