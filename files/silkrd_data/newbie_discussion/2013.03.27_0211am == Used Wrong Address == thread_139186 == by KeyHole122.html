				Yes, I know that I am stupid, so you don&#039;t have to tell me that.&nbsp; You can, however, tell me what you think might happen, given this scenario:&nbsp; Rented a box at the UPS store, using my real name.&nbsp; Made three orders and mistakenly gave the vendors a street address that was off by a single digit.&nbsp; Orders didn&#039;t arrive, and they couldn&#039;t have been sent to another address, since the one I gave, the wrong one, was in between two legitimate ones.&nbsp; In other words, it turned out to be a nonexistent address.&nbsp; It&#039;s my understanding that the packages will go to a dead letter office and eventually be opened.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Will the USPS launch an investigation?&nbsp; Would the fact that three packages were involved make them more aggressive?&nbsp; Any smart investigator walking down the street would see that the UPS store was probably the intended address.&nbsp; And then I would be cooked.&nbsp;

				That situation sucks.<br /><br />Some sellers (myself included) add fictional return addresses, so some unsuspecting person may have received your drugs :P<br /><br />One way or another there&#039;s some chance it&#039;ll be investigated - what kind of amounts were involved?

				I&#039;d say your best choice is to lay low. If you did it right, you shouldn&#039;t have any incriminating evidence against you. I&#039;m not to familiar how it works after, but you may not want to order from the SR in your name/address again.<br /><br />Best of luck! (measure twice, cut once)
