				So, I am here to confirm other posts which make claims of this vendor&#039;s bad business. I ordered 14g of Green Crack from him, 5 days later I received a package containing 28g of Amnesia. Written on the container within was &quot;Ran out of GC, sorry man. x2 g AM, 28g.&quot; The first thing I noticed was a strong ammonia/urine smell. I sort of brushed it off and smoked the stuff anyway. When it burned, the ash was pure black even when fully cashed. I got a sore throat and headaches and now, a week after I stopped smoking it, I have a tight chest and a productive cough with big chunks of whitish mucus. <br /><br />I contacted the vendor explaining these things and he claimed ignorance, saying that he had a shipping guy mix up orders with me and that his grower knew nothing out of the ordinary about this product. He offered a 100$ refund on the 150$ product under the condition that I sent him back the 14g that I have left. If you take a look at his feedback vs. presence in the forums, he is getting 5-6 transactions a day, almost all 5/5 and claiming that his stuff is &quot;A++ medical&quot; etc. I&#039;ve left him a 1/5 rating and he&#039;s not responding to my last message stating that I decline his offer to send him the 14g back.<br /><br />Sorry about the choppy sentences, I can&#039;t think clearly recently, perhaps due to smoking what I think was moldy weed for a week. The headaches are still sticking around. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this vendor? If you are thinking about buying from MarleysMainMan, DONT DO IT. Take a look at what people are saying on the forums, he always plays it off like they&#039;re just hating on him but the main point is that he&#039;s all over the place trying to promote his sales when he has a plentiful volume of sales everyday. Next time I will do more research... I&#039;m pasting my buyer stats so it is understood that he didn&#039;t sell me this shit weed because I have poor stats. Buyers beware.<br /><br />Total transactions: 19<br />Total spent: $1292.41<br />Refund rate: 1.3%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 8 months<br /><br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe what I&#039;m saying about him then here are a few last giveaways. His massive amount of listings for the same product in different quantities indicates that he is not making many legitimate sales and he needs to give you more options so there is a higher chance of him having something that better fits your bitcoin wallet. Also the VIP and platinum club thing is supposed to make you think that he has regular customers but after out transaction I SERIOUSLY doubt it. Long live the SR, publicly diss the scammers so people know to avoid them.<br />

				Hey jjr5288, we are really confused why you chose to post all this about us instead of trying to work something out but I guess we&#039;ll never know. Anyways since you told your side of the story we&#039;ll tell ours. We processed your order and ran out of the particular strain you ordered and actually ended up giving you double the amount of your original order (ordered 14g got 28g). We apologized for our mistake of giving you 28g of Amnesia instead of 14g Green Crack.(even though you got a free 1/2 oz) But what really boggles my mind is the fact you left us a 5/5 saying quote unquote &quot;Dank bud, great purchase.5/5&quot; A week later you contact us after the fact you changed your rating to a 1/5 complaining about how you ran &#039;some tests&quot; and our product failed them because of some &quot;black ash&quot;...We smoke this weed just like our customers EVERY DAY and never once out of all of our transactions has this been a problem, nor has anyone been sick coughing up &quot;big chunks of white mucus&quot;. So&nbsp; we tried to come up with a resolution together and YOU came up with the idea to ship us back the extra half ounce which we gladly said we&#039;d accept and in return refund you $100. so you will now in the end have a total of 1/2 an oz and $100 when you paid $150. Now we&#039;ve been more than willing to try and come up and an agreement where both of us are happy but you can&#039;t just make demands and expect us to follow your every word.You are holding our rating ransom in exchange for goods, that&#039;s blackmail man:(&nbsp; So now you want us to ship you ANOTHER 1/2 OZ or $150 on top of the WHOLE OZ you mistakenly received...kinda fishy to me...This is a business we&#039;ve worked very hard to maintain and will stay working hard to keep our customers happy, and they know this! We have been on the road going on 8mo now with you as our ONLY unsatisfied customer! What does that say huh? So I sent you a message today to refund your entire order IF you return the extra half ounce you still have in your possession.(which i doubt you will since you said you wanted to &quot;throw it away&quot; lol) I&#039;m sorry we had to discuss this on the forums instead of a private message but it had to be done I guess. We will Not be bullied man. If you want to resolve this in and adult fashion, we&#039;re all ears man. And if you wanna call us liars, remember, we do have every single message sent between us and I&#039;m more than willing to prove to the community here we&#039;re not a fault. Once again we hope you decide to come to a peaceful resolution on this with us. As for our regular customers...I&#039;m sorry you had to hear this lol:)<br /><br />MMM

				To jjr5288: I&#039;ve been on SR for alittle over 3 months and I have dealt with many different cannabis vendors. Not all the transactions have went completely smooth to begin with but with alittle patience and a friendly attitude the vendors have ALWAYS tried to resolve ANY issues and make sure that I, the customer, was happy. I&#039;ve noticed that alot of times when there is a slight mix up with an order 9 times out of 10 any negative feedback is because they messaged the vendor and then felt they were ignored. You have to remember that most of these vendors also have jobs and are very busy people. They will usually always get back to you, but maybe not as fast as you would like. And this is where the problems occur because the customer then feels as though they are being ignored, and then the threats start, and then the bad feedback is given, and then the nasty reviews are posted in the forum. When in reality the vendor never even saw your message. Of course this is a generalization, I&#039;m just saying this is what it looks like to me. And this is what looks like has happened to MMM. This is a strange one though since you did write it was dank in the review and it took it you 7 days and 14 grams later to realize that it actually wasn&#039;t that dank... ? The only criticism I would have for MMM was that once you realized you didn&#039;t have the green crack to either ask jjr if he would mind the substitute or to cancel the order. This has happened once with me I had ordered 3 strains to try and only received 2 because he said he had only shake left and didn&#039;t think I would want that(good call) but he made up for it by giving my extra. Definately not DOUBLE like you got. It wasn&#039;t a big deal at all I was actually happier because I had received more than what I had payed for. And yes one of those two strains was the amnesia which didn&#039;t make me cough up mucus but did get me really high. You got double what you payed for and gave MMM a 1/5? come on man. There are only 4 cannabis vendors that I regularly use after nearly 2 and a half months of experimenting with different vendors and MMM is one of them. He always has high quality weed at a reasonable price plus he is very friendly and easy to work with if you have PATIENCE. Thats the key. I&#039;m sure if you PM him he will gladly work it out as will most vendors on SR. Just thought I&#039;d give you some helpful advice for the future :)

				It was really unnecessary to log in to another username just to say that... So I&#039;m just gonna ignore that post and respond to your first one below...<br /><br />Ahem... We already tried to work something out, but that didn&#039;t work, which is why after a week of trying and it not working i&#039;ve resorted to posting here.<br /><br />Anyways, regarding your post, talk about a blame shift... I&#039;ve NEVER posted bad about any vendor until I bought from MarleysMainMan. And you&#039;re calling this blackmail??? I&#039;m doing this so that you will fess up and take responsibility for selling me some bunk weed. Yeah, I want a refund, and I have a feeling that you&#039;re not going to do it, so I&#039;m calling you out on your shit here so that you will have the incentive to do so.<br /><br />Yeah, what you sold me could potentially be dank and get me high, but how relevant is that when it smells like ammonia(common for moldy weed, even when the mold isn&#039;t visible) and gives me a lung infection, headaches, and chest pain?... What I&#039;m going to do now is refer to other readers to other threads that call you out on your shit so they know that I&#039;m not the only one. To find the shit just press ctrl+f and search MarleysMainMan or MMM.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18265.msg454252#msg454252<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71491.msg603731#msg603731<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95596.msg679148#msg679148<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=88888.msg644851#msg644851<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30103.msg335532#msg335532<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27271.msg453927#msg453927<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71535.msg589511#msg589511<br /><br />There&#039;s a few for starts, the only reason that I bought from him was because I was getting so much &quot;good weed&quot; for the money (14g for 150)... Turns out it wasn&#039;t worth it. Another thing I&#039;ll call you out on publicly, you are now, for the third time, claiming that you sent me the ounce by mistake. Readers, please look to my original post where it says ...Written on the container within was &quot;Ran out of GC, sorry man. x2 g AM, 28g.&quot;... I ordered 14g of GC from him, so obviously there is a blatant lie. DONT ORDER FROM HIM. I&#039;m public calling him out on his shit for a refund but I doubt it&#039;s going to happen, don&#039;t make the same mistake that I did otherwise you may find yourself doing the same thing. Any good feedback or posts about him, you can expect all of those to be sills without a doubt.<br /><br />Now I will finish this posts with two quotes that really give this guy away. They are taken from these links<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30980.msg348433#msg348433<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30010.120 <br /><br />&quot;this guy is bitching about the rude people which yeah there is rude people but bitching is not needed. Let your product talk then no one will bitch :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Update:&nbsp; I received my order.&nbsp; I got both GC and Amnesia.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of these reviews are saying how good the bud is....&nbsp; you guys must have never had any REAL medical quality bud.&nbsp; The bud that I received from MMM was sub par to say the least.&nbsp; The amnesia that I received was definitely outdoor weed and it smoked like outdoor, very harsh smoke.&nbsp; The GC was just a little bit better looking but was also very harsh.&nbsp; This is NOT Medical Grade BUD.&nbsp; There are many other good weed vendors on the road that have much better bud than MMM does.&nbsp; I WILL NOT be purchasing from this vendor again.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another thing, this vendor screamed scammer when he first set up a vendor account on the road a few months back.&nbsp; I waited until now to place an order from him because I read all his quality reviews......I am glad that I received my order despite the quality of the bud but it seems like some people here have orders in transit and no communication.&nbsp; Could this vendor finally be showing his true colors? &quot; -Meatwad<br /><br />Looks like you oh so terribly wrong about me being your &quot;ONLY unsatisfied customer&quot;.. Perhaps there would be many many more if you had more real customers. The offer still stands that I&#039;ll take this all down if you refund me, but with your type of business it looks like that&#039;s only a figment of yours in order to get more out of me. Sorry it came down to this but you brought it on yourself, you really did buddy.

I&#039;m a customer not a vendor. I&#039;m new to the forums not to SR. I just like to stick up for vendors that I feel go above and beyond because they are far and few between on SR. I&#039;d say MMM, Northwest Direct, WestCoastRX, and GreenOvenDoor are the best quality/price ratio vendors on here that I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;m looking forward to trying out Christy Nugs but I need 5 more months on the road before I can order(her policy). Seeing the way you act in just the two posts you put on this thread I can definately see why there&#039;s such a problem, though. I was simply trying to help you out by telling you patience is the key, but clearly my words have fallen on deaf ears. And in all honesty you just kind of come off like a chode, bro. Good luck getting your money back.

				Newbie discussion / Re: La Fuente&#039;s Weed?<br />« on: February 26, 2013, 11:00 pm »<br />I should be getting an oz from his very shortly now. The shipping time is something to be desired but you can&#039;t beat that price. I&#039;ll let you know in a few days how it is. Hopefully tomorrow...<br /><br />Ok, calling names here, you definitely are sounding like MarleysMainMan/Mr. Yellow/MaryJanesEx and who knows which other vendor accounts you&#039;ve had. You see above I&#039;ve quoted your first post in the forums, taking place at February 26, 2013, 11:00 pm... now notice that my original post of this thread was at February 26, 2013, 10:58 pm » ... That&#039;s TWO MINUTES later, coincidence??? Lol... And please don&#039;t insult any of the legitimate top vendors by associating your name in there with their&#039;s... I welcome anyone else who has had a negative experience with MarleysMainMan to post in this thread. I am not expecting a refund at this point, I just want this dick banned from SR so that what happened to me doesn&#039;t happen to someone else. I have a doctors appointment to day at the University Health Services at 1:00 PM where I expect to be treated for a fungal lung infection, hopefully they give me some strong ass antibiotics to clear up this terrible mess caused by this sad excuse for a vendor who is truly not willing to take responsibility for his poor services. No refund yet guys... I&#039;ll let you know if I ever get it, but like you said, MarleysMainMan, while using your obvious alterego account DanDanTheIceCreamMan, I shouldn&#039;t expect the refund which is why I&#039;ve resorted to downing this guy publicly. BUYERS BEWARE... and expect a post shortly after this one with either MarleysMainMan, DanDanTheIceCreamMan, or another one of his alterego&#039;s trying to back up a bad business that will hopefully be ended shortly.

				Hey man, if you got a bad reaction to the shit, you should probably stop smoking it (as I am sure you already know). The ammonia smell, in particular, plus the symptoms you described, and the fact you got 28 when it should&#039;ve been 14, it might have some &quot;enhancements&quot; and whatnot. Not taking either party&#039;s side, here. Just saying, for your health, don&#039;t smoke it until you know what it is. And if it is spiked with some chemical, shame on the vendor. That&#039;s not cool at all

				jjr is right only about one thing and that is I shouldn&#039;t have resorted to name-calling, very childish I know. But the thing that really biggles my mind with this guy is the fact that it took him 7 days and 14 grams to figure out it was bad weed. Seems strange to me is all. And seeing as how I don&#039;t really know both sides of the story I won&#039;t comment on it anymore cuz who knows, maybe marley did pour ammonia on his weed or piss on it. The only two people that will ever know are Marley and jjr. I was simply trying to help out a fellow SR user by trying to share my own experience and trying to explain that patience is the key 9 times out of 10. I also am not really sure what the whole timestamp thing is about and why you found it to be so coincidental and funny on your last post. I guess posting about other vendors I&#039;m using means that I&#039;m Marley? lol anyway I actaually did just get that zip from LF in the mail today and will be writing a review a little later. I want to wait til I get 50 posts so I can do it on his actually thread rather than the noob thread, which the whole 50 post thing is extrememly frustrating i might add especially since tor is so slow. But again jjr I&#039;m sorry for name-calling and I really do hope that everything is alright with your lungs. I&#039;d never wish ill-health on anyone. And MMM I&#039;d check your batch to make sure no one else comes across the same problem. And with that I&#039;m done with this thread, on to bigger and better things :)

				I&#039;ll try to address everything here. The 7 days and 14 grams thing.. As you know, it can take time for a sickness to develop and if the weed didn&#039;t make me sick I&#039;d still be smoking it now.. I didn&#039;t get sick immediately though and even if I did I might have kept smoking it because of the fact that I&#039;m addicted. I only stopped and complained when it was just too bad to smoke anymore.<br /><br />About the patience, as I&#039;ve stated, I have been very patient.. I waited 7 days after complaining to Marley to post this thread and I only did so because he is unwilling to refund me without me first sending him back the 14 grams I have left.. The reason I&#039;m not going to do that is because he&#039;s already screwed me over once and I don&#039;t want him to do it again as I still may be able to sell this stuff at a discounted rate instead of risking the loss of it without him refunding me, which it seems like those are his intentions.<br /><br />About the timestamp thing.. Are you retarded? You&#039;ve been a member for 3 months and your very first post on the forums was a few days back JUST 2 MINUTES after my original post in this thread.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;m going to get to 50 posts too but it&#039;s only so that I can refer to this thread in the non-newb forum. I&#039;m trying to be very elaborate here in my posts because I know that readers look for elaborate posts on a vendor when considering the purchase of their product. I hope people don&#039;t fall for his scam, hopefully this thread draws from his sales as I intend it to... Right now I&#039;m waiting on a reply from him but I don&#039;t expect one and I think it&#039;s because of the content of my last message to him. I&#039;ll paste it below so that people can see how he&#039;s dodging every valid claim made against him... Maybe I&#039;ll hear back but I doubt he&#039;s ever gonna give me the refund that I deserve. BUYERS BEWARE OF MARLEYSMAINMAN<br /><br />MarleysMainMan(99) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all we would NEVER send someone an extra half OZ (when they only ordered a half OZ) as making up for being out of the strain they ordered. That&#039;s giving some one 150$ worth of weed free, for a small mistake! come on man! So right now we have given you 260$ dollars worth of weed and you want us to send you 100$ more cash when we have no guarantee you will play ball, especially when you have changed your rating from a 5/5 to 3/5 now a 1/5! We have already cut our losses and accepted your rating at this point, we have so many loyal customers who know we&#039;re legit. Check OUR stats, 8mo 1500 transactions with just ONE unsatisfied customer...(You) We have nothing to prove to anyone at this point man. We are willing to still refund you, but sending you another 100$ cash and just hoping you play ball isn&#039;t worth it for us at this point. especially when we have NO RECOURSE if you don&#039;t keep your word, where on your end you can just go back to flaming us on the forums and leave a shitty rating if we don&#039;t keep our word....see what I mean man? Let me know.<br /><br />jjr5288&nbsp; &nbsp; You say that you would NEVER send an extra half OZ, and yet you did. Do you really trust me so little that you need me to send you a picture of the &quot;x2 (28g) amnesia. ran out of GC sorry man&quot; comment that you left on the packaging? You&#039;re trying to tell me that 2 times 14 doesn&#039;t equal 28? I think we should address that before moving on. And yet again you say I&#039;m the ONE unsatisfied customer when I&#039;ve proven in the forums that you&#039;re lying about that and that there are indeed others who are unsatisfied with your service. Don&#039;t be so dodgy and I won&#039;t flame you so heavily. It&#039;s time for you to start taking responsibility, address the two points that I&#039;ve made here otherwise I&#039;m simply going to give up on you.<br /><br />

				Ok so go ahead and explain how i&#039;ve &quot;made out pretty good&quot; by receiving contaminated weed... Trust me, NOTHING is good about it. And you say he doesn&#039;t have to provide me with service, yet he&#039;s a vendor, service is what they do. Keep on posting on here with new accounts Marley, you&#039;re convincing people how legitimate you are that way, nah not really... You&#039;ve got a bad bad business buddy, getting on other accounts just to make it seem like you have people that stand for you... Go fuck yourself man. Anybody searching your name is gonna see this thread, I&#039;M LOVIN IT. Don&#039;t buy from marleysmainman, he&#039;s a terrible vendor and you&#039;ll regret it, I promise you this. Check out my other posts, I&#039;ve never flamed any other vendor because I&#039;ve simply never had a reason to, it&#039;s all been smooth transactions with no issues until this one.

Wait just one minute. Regardless of who is scamming who here the fact that you&#039;d sell shitty weed that you say has made you sick kinda hurts your credibility. Why the fuck would you do that to someone else for money. If you&#039;re so upset about being sick and the weed being shit that you have to bitch for the love of god don&#039;t fuck someone else over. Even if you are getting scammed you&#039;d be doing THE SAME SHIT to whoever you sold to. Come on, we&#039;re potheads not crack fiends.

				You will never win, no matter how many different accounts you post from... According to the laws of business, the customer always comes first, and I was your customer. I WAS your customer, there is a very good reason why I never will be again... To recount, you sold me contaminated/old weed that gave me a dirty crappy high and anxiety along with physical symptoms after extended use. I kept smoking it because I was desperate and it was the only weed I had. I then attempted to flush the weed of impurities using a cold water flush method, it did not work. You never refunded me. You continuously blame me as a scammer when I am not as you can see by the rest of my posts. You suck, fuck you. Readers, expect more defense coming soon from this useless piece of trash, he&#039;s that egotistic &quot;always has to have the last word&quot; kind of guy.

				Just for clarification.. I initially gave positive feedback because I did get high even though it was a artificial dirty type high that is unlike what I&#039;m used to, the physical illness didn&#039;t kick in until a few days after I started smoking it which is when I realized that it was not good for my health and I certainly did not like the high. The weed would not kill anybody so I&#039;m not a bad person and I was selling it for the price of mids... <br /><br />I have ordered with great success from many top vendors on SR: NorCalKing, WestCoastRX, PuffBuddy, FarmerBob, Rook, Farmer1, Californication, TweetB, UnderGroundSyndicate, RoRock, Nawlins, OpiumTea, Einstein777... Look through my posts, you will not find anything negative about these guys, they are all excellent representatives of what the Silk Road should be based on, trustworthy business. The truth is that you, MarleysMainMan, are a part of the bad crowd on SR, you made me feel like you don&#039;t care about keeping me as a customer and for that, and the low quality of your products, I will never purchase from you again. Beware buyers, I suspect MarleysMainMan of making many buyer accounts so that he can keep up his rating and post good feedback about himself as well as appearing to have fans who will defend him when it is more likely than not just him on several accounts. I&#039;d go with other vendors that I&#039;ve listed above, it&#039;s possible that MarleysMainMan selectively scammed me but I feel like it is my duty as an avid SR user to strongly advise you to avoid him so you don&#039;t make the same mistake that I did, his too-good-to-be-true listings are discounted for a reason, to lure you in. <br /><br />The two refunds I received were from NorCalKing and Rook due to undelivered packages, I requested a refund from MarleysMainMan foor his poor service but he never did, here are my purchasing stats for credibility sake:<br /><br />Total transactions: 23<br />Total spent: $1599.99<br />Refund rate: 0.59%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 11 months<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe what I&#039;m saying about him then here are a few last giveaways. His massive amount of listings for the same product in different quantities indicates that he is not making many legitimate sales and he needs to give you more options so there is a higher chance of him having something that better fits your bitcoin wallet. Also the VIP and platinum club thing is supposed to make you think that he has regular customers but after out transaction I SERIOUSLY doubt it. Long live the SR, publicly diss the scammers so people know to avoid them.
