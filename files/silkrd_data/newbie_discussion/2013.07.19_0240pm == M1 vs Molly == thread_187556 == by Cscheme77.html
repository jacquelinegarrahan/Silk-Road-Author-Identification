				Hello Friends , I was just wandering if M1 and Molly are anything alike or what are the differences between the two? I saw that one guy&#039;s complaint was that he got M1 for Molly saying that he got screwed. I am thinking of selling Molly and with people trying to pass M1 off as Molly , I just wanted to know. Thanks

				Molly is smoother and feel like more of a natural euphoria.&nbsp; m1 is shorter and has a fairly intense peak.&nbsp; &nbsp;i also have come to the understanding that m1 is less neurotoxic, but i&#039;m not positive on that. <br /><br />i think molly is more special.&nbsp;

				MDMA used to be really hard to come by, and back in the RC days there was hope that an analogue would be found.&nbsp; Go back and read the reveiws of RC&#039;s&nbsp; on Erowid, and you see people rating them along the MDMA spectrum:&nbsp; are they empathogens, are the entactogens.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does it make you want to dance, does it make you want to smooch.&nbsp; Does it fill your heart with love.&nbsp; The answer is always, &quot;well kinda.&quot;<br /><br />You can be a connoisseur of chemicals, and at risk of sounding like a French wine snob, I&#039;ll say this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There is only one MDMA, and since you&#039;re thinking about ordering off SR, where you can order MDMA that&#039;s been tested and independently reviewed by a committee of chemists, I can&#039;t imagine why you would intentionally chose an RC over the real thing.&nbsp; <br />

				Maybe I&#039;m just getting old, but I actually prefer methylone over MDMA. The euphoria is less &quot;forced on you&quot;, it is easier to socialize with non-inebriated people, and the after-effects on my mood and energy level are much more mild the days after. It is probably not easy or advisible to reach for the same degree of euphoria as you can get from a solid dose of MDMA, but I like the control and more sobtle effects of M1 better. <br />It does have a tendency to induce blackout for me if I&#039;m just slightly too generous with the dose, though, even more so than with MDMA, I think.

				Theyre not even comparable. Been in the MDMA scene a long time and if someone sold me M1 as molly I would be pissed. I can eat grams of M1 and i dont even feel like Im rolling even a tiny bit. I can eat .2 of MDMA and roll my nuts off. Fuck M1

				They are different chemicals, good for different situations. If I want a good, clean high (without it being completely mindblowing) at a concert where it is not acceptable to be rollin&#039; off your ass, I prefer methylone, combined with a slight bit of acid or 2C-X. If I&#039;m at an underground rave, fuck it, MDMA usually IS a better high.

				Since I first started messing with RCs I&#039;ve been wanting to get some real M1 and only tried it once.&nbsp; It was yellow and moist and cakey with a strong fish odor.&nbsp; Is this the correct appearance?&nbsp; After a small oral dose of around 50 mg I didn&#039;t notice much.&nbsp; I proceded to IV and even up to 200 mg produced a nice X like euphoria that faded in seconds.&nbsp; I want to try this more than any other and have tried many many other RCs.&nbsp; My favorite so far has been the IV rush of good 4MMC and the best I&#039;ve had caused that train sound like good coke but only that one batch that came from eastern europe.&nbsp; Does anyone have any experience with IVing good M1?

				A good oral dose of MDMA beats all IMO but I&#039;m the experimental type and want to see what all the fuss is about regarding M1.&nbsp; I like RCs just for the fact that there is so much to experiment with.&nbsp; I only recently found out what the hype of shooting heroin was about, I just had to know.&nbsp; Damn do I know now, whoah.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t done it again since but I finally see what the fuss is about.

				Good Molly wins hands down, however good M1 is better than average Molly. <br /><br />But with SR access, you can easily get good Molly! So go with that!

				MDMA wins hands down in my eyes, i don&#039;t find the effects of M1 in anyway similar to MD, good MD is more of a psychedelic than a stimulant, i had a lot of experience with M1 last summer (mainly because i bought a shit-tonne of it) and i found that all it did for me was leave me minorly stimulated, however then i started taking fairly large amounts of it and at this point i started to get serious &quot;cocaine-brain&quot; you know that mindframe shit coke puts you in of thinking you&#039;re more important than anyone else and that your time isn&#039;t worth some of the interactions you have with people, needless to say i got rid of the end of my M1 quick sharp as i felt like a cunt for selling it, all in all i think its a pretty nasty drug but that could also be down to the fact that i over-did it on it, i did over a q at a festival and subsequently gave myself minor kidney poisoning and a mental breakdown, however over the years i have seriously over-done it with MDMA, to much more of an extant than i did with M1, and i didnt find it had such a negative effect on my mind and body. Does that answer your question at all?

				Main differences<br /><br />Effect: M1:MD<br /><br />Comeup: M1: 20-40 mins range, food depending<br />MD: 45-1:30, depending on person<br /><br />Duration: M1: 1hr - 1:30, much shorter lasting, kind of drops off near the end<br />MD: 2 hr - 5 hr, longer lasting, fuller in effect, has a pleasant down slope in the end<br /><br />Effects: M1, more stimulant, euphoric, energetic, clean, urge to dance and party and fuck<br />MD, mildly stimulating, deeper euphoria, empathy, urge to dance and party and fuck, &quot;beautiful&quot; potent<br /><br />Repetitive dosing: M1&#039;s dosing is limited by intake. After the first half gram or so, many of the euphoric qualities fade, and many of the stimulating qualities continue<br />MD, repetitive dosing with real molly can work for days if done in reasonable doses. The euphoria can be felt for a while. I&#039;ve done it at 3 day events before and rolled real hard all three days. M1 requires at least a week to get similar effects of euphoria and enjoyment.<br /><br />MD
