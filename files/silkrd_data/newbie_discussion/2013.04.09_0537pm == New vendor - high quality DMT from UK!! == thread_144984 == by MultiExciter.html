				Hi everyone!<br />I just though to introduce myself.<br /><br />I&#039;m a new vendor at SR - Multi Exciter, selling exclusively high quality DMT.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/33dc843c15<br /><br />I have strong background in chemistry (master degree) and over 15 years passion for psychedelics which ended up in many years of DMT production. <br />I make my stuff using slightly improved STB Method (mostly temperature control, good quality ingredients and my passion), which helped me achieving really good quality and high extraction yields.<br /><br />I have been making this stuff for many years now, usually selling it at summer festivals in Europe or sharing with my friends, until I discovered this magical place :)<br /><br />I do have experience in sending stealth packages, so don&#039;t worry that I&#039;m new and your order won&#039;t arrive.<br /><br />I&#039;m UK based and will send my goodies worldwide with some exceptions…<br />Please contact me first if you want to order from outside EU.<br />I really believe I&#039;ve got something good to offer to this community, so let me invite you to check out me products.<br /><br />I will be very happy to answer any questions you might have.<br />Peace and Love

				Hi :)<br />I made a wonderful experience with MultiExciters DMT crystals that I want to share with you. It was my first breakthrough. Before I just couldn&#039;t get deep enough into hyperspace.<br /><br />To let a wonderful spring day fade out I decided to smoke some DMT crystals. I darkened my room, lit some candles and played the first symphony of Johannes Brahms. I loaded the bong with 50 mg of white DMT crystals and sandwiched it with peppermint and ash. Then I meditated in front of my shiva statue and breathed deeply in and out for some time. Three big hits were taken and immediately a psychedelic fireworks exploded behind my cortex. Slowly the taste of the molecule spread in my mouth – surprisingly tasteful. I looked at my hands and saw myself transforming into an alien. The effect kicked in hard and I felt on my side.<br />My surrounding immediately transformed and everything was covered with perfect geometric patterns in every imaginable color – astonishing alien art. Helical entities with hundreds of eyes began to clasp my head from every side. For a short moment I got panic and thought that I gone mad totally. It almost felt like being retarded as I couldn&#039;t form any clear thought nor could I explain what was going on. Then the entities spoke to me by telepathy. They massaged my brain and told me that everything was fine. I felt relieved and a deep peace of mind.<br />For ten minutes I was in contact with the other. They came in peace. We united and loved us. They are much more intelligent than we are (which btw isn&#039;t that difficult). I got channeled and they gave me answers to mysteries of life and the universe (unfortunately I can&#039;t remember that much of it). They affirmed that the universe is a endless organic ensemble full of intelligent forms of life. After listening to their ancient wisdom I felt enlightened for a moment – ready to enter nirvana. Slowly the effects subsided. I thanked the entities for the peace and wisdom they brought me and then they disappeared.<br />As I awoke I got an gorgeous female body (I&#039;m male) – I was overwhelmed by my own beauty. My cat came to me and cuddled me for some time. The whole room was fraught with love.<br />It got dark outside and the full moon shone brightly. I decided to take a walk. The world was enchanted and everything danced to the music (Elysium – Monzoon). Spring was about to begin and I felt Gaia breathing. Life awoke everywhere around me and birds sang songs of pure joy. I felt deeply connected to the planet and all living beings – everything is one. I thought about what Terence McKenna calls the Gaian Mind and could feel the intelligence of mother earth.<br /><br />After the experience I feel more alive than ever before and appreciate my life much more. I was charged with energy and creativity which still lasts. Even my friends and family benefit from my experience – I&#039;m full with love. This precious substance brought me peace with myself and my surrounding within 15 minutes. It showed me how I can live my life in bliss. Every day is getting more beautiful than the day before. The world is enchanted and I&#039;m delighted by the beauty of life. I can&#039;t stop marveling about the true nature of the world. Life is the greatest gift of all.<br />The everyday life is an illusion and with the aid of this magical molecule we&#039;re able transcend subjectivity and download the answers to all our questions. The tool for peace is all around us. We have to use it wise and listen to what it tells us. DMT is the key to true understanding. We have found the holy grail. <br /><br />His crystals are one of the purest I&#039;ve smoked from the road. Thanks for making this possible!<br />Peace and Love
