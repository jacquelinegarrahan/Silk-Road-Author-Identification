				Hi all. I placed two small orders on Tuesday from trusted vendors that I have used in the past. Orders were still processing later that day. Next day go to logon and I saw the shutdown. These should&#039;ve arrived by now. Should I assume that these orders will likely not be shipped? Haven&#039;t been able to find any contact info of the vendors. Glad I used pgp for everything. Any help would be appreciated. Cheers

				I was in the same spot, except I had 1 order instead of your 2. <br /><br />what I did - and what I would recommend you to do as well - was to check out if I can find the vendor anywhere else (BMR/SM, in my case) and luckily enough I found the said vendor and got clearance to my question(s) and even worries, since... who knows how bad the timing could have been, I thought the worst possible luck would mean LE has my address. I am overtly paranoid, very sceptical by nature, so I wanted closure. and I got it, I breathe easier now and do not expect unwanted visitors in the next few days. <br /><br />try to find your vendors from these forums, or the other marketplaces... and ask them what&#039;s up. I wish you good luck and that no pigs are holding the envelopes/packages with your address on them, as we speak.
