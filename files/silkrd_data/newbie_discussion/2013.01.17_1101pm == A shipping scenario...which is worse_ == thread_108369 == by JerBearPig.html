				I am not a newbie and have been a member for almost a year now but please forgive me for posting this here as I can&#039;t seem to post anywhere else.<br /><br />I really would like to get something I have yet to try and have found the only quality and price reasonable is overseas. Keep in mind this is a personal amount. So here is the dilemma....<br /><br />Do I order from NL from a very reputable vendor with all the risks that come from that or do I order from UK from another very reputable vendor having to FE; which I did for my first buy and swore never to do again. <br /><br />I would just say fuck it and wait but I am seeing some friends I have not seen in a while and would like to surprise them with a gift.

				always best to go with the one with better refund/reship policies. Can&#039;t do that if you have to FE.<br /><br />I know there is hype about stuff from NL not getting into the US. I think it&#039;s over exaggerated as I&#039;ve ordered several times from NL the only downside is it&#039;ll take longer to get here. 3-4 weeks as opposed to 2 weeks.

				Thanks for the info. He has nothing but positive feedback and offers a quite generous refund policy. Seems very confident in his methods. I am more just worried about burning the address. It&#039;s very inexpensive, so losing the money is no problem; losing the address would upset me though.

				Vendor in UK and FE. It seems you&#039;ve answered your own question. If you&#039;re more worried about losing the place you send it to.

				I&#039;d try to avoid the FE option. If the NL vendor has great reviews for domestic/international shipping and has a decent policy for packages that dont make it then thats def your better bet.

				I wouldn&#039;t FE early. You are just asking for it. Especially since you have another option. <br /><br />The escrow program is the only protection you have. <br /><br />Let&#039;s assume he is a great seller and has no intention of ripping you off. There are any number of things that can happen ( besides theft&nbsp; )that could prevent the seller from shipping after he has your coin. Life happens to people and you would be stuck. <br /><br />On the other hand let&#039;s assume you are an honest buyer you find a buyer that won&#039;t require you to FE so you Ho with him/her.&nbsp; You use the escrow system and life happens to you. <br /><br />The seller will still get his coin and a positive rating auto. <br /><br />Just make sure you promptly free the funds and leave meaningful feedback.<br /><br />I understand the sellers irritation. If they ship well, fast and product is as described they are entitled to quick payment and positive feedback. <br /><br />It only takes a minute. <br /><br />Hope it all goes well for you.

				Everybody has the Netherlands flagged as a country where drugs come from because it is true. <br /><br />Order small amounts from vendors with high ratings and it will be fine.
