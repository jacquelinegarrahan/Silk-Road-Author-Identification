				Have you read the Big and Dandy 3c-P thread at Bluelight? <br /><br />This is taken from it.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+0: solution of 55mg 3C-P administered (RA).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+25: definite first alerts while running errands.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+35: interoceptive wavering sensations and a sense that my equilibrium is riding slow rolling waves.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+40: slight impairment of cognition noted. I’ve returned to the house.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+60: feels like 2C-B, with maybe more of a stimulant push. If not for the difference in its rate of onset and extreme length I doubt I could tell them apart, however, this is exactly what I was hoping for so my ability to discern other qualitative differences is almost certainly biased toward the interpretation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; T+70: Plateau? If this experience is like my last one with 3C-P I expect qualitative shifts in the trip are forthcoming but the sense of accelerating intensity I associate with the onset of all drugs has leveled out. Mild-to-moderate CEVs and OEVs are also noted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I expect to be tripping for about 11 hours, with residual effects for hours after that. I’ve only ever tried 3C-P RA but given the descriptions of oral dosages and my lack of 5-HT psychedelic tolerance I’m guessing the potency increase over oral is not as dramatic as with 2C-Xs. The biggest advantage I see is probably just that the route speeds the onset and so shortens the overall time between starting the trip and when sleep is possible.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Compared to the only other psychedelic amphetamine I’ve tried, DOM, the vasoconstrictive side-effects are mild. There is comparatively little anxiolytic edge to the trip as well. This is about as mild and non-committally euphoric (without stepping into empathogen territory proper like aMT can) as I can imagine a psychedelic being so I&#039;m calling it a good addition to the trippy tool kit for those who want that option. Formerly, TMA-6 held that designation for me. I think it&#039;s about perfect for day long light recreation -- beach and summer picnic stuff. I&#039;m guessing I could trip on this in front of co-workers without worrying I&#039;d raise suspicions as well, I&#039;d just come off as being in a talkative good mood. I can see why Jesus Green mentioned it as supplying motivation to write. If it weren&#039;t so long lasting it would make a great psychedelic for those just looking for an introductory taste of what they&#039;re all about.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I think it may combine well with gabapentin … yeah I’m gonna go do that.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; EDIT: Though I still feel 3C-P is a largely recreational psychedelic, I see now that it can be much more if you work with it. I was petting my girlfriend’s cat just now and reveling in her innocence as she hugged and rubbed her face against my thigh. I projected myself into her empathically during this and the level of recursion doing so incurred caused a sort of fractalization of my consciousness, snowballing into what felt like the beginnings of a partial seizure. I see better now the relationship between empathy and selflessness. The experience was like a pang of ego death. It&#039;s helping me get better at actively feeling better. <br /><br />
