				Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don&#039;t resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.

				Here&#039;s a guide Ruthenium posted on this thread : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129116.0;topicseen<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">10g of morphine.HCl or freebase was added to 30g acetic anhydride, this was refluxed at 85C for 6 hours, after the solution cooled, 90ml dH2O was added, (5-10ml chloroform or dichloromethane may be added also), the solution stirred for 30 minutes and left standing for 20 minutes, the chloroform/dcm layer should be coloured red from the greasy impurities, that layer was separated in a sep funnel and the aqueous (upper) layer saved. 5 grams of activated charcoal was added to the aqueous layer and allowed to absorb more impurities, filter and repeat until solution is clear.<br />22g of sodium carbonate dissolved in 30ml hot water are added to the solution until heroin freebase precipitates, the white powdery heroin base was dried, purification was obtained by dissolving it in twice it&#039;s mass of boiling absolute ethanol, filtering the solution into a pre warmed filter and flask, removing traces of sodium carbonate that remained in the base.<br />The ethanol solution was evaporated to obtain pretty fucking pure heroin base.<br />10g of heroin base was added to 65ml absolute ethanol, 70ml dry Et2O, 30% HCl was added drop wise until pH was 7. As soon as it&#039;s done converting, 30ml dry EtOH was added and 35ml Et2O with it. As soon the crystals precipitate, 20ml Et2O is added at once, the solution stirred, after one hour the solution should be close to solid, the heroin was filtered, the rocks were allowed to dry by air.<br />Yield: pretty fucking pure heroin.HCl <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Note that EtOH = ethanol and Et2O = diethyl ether and DCM = dichloromethane. The last step to make heroin HCl isn&#039;t necessary if you want to smoke it. Extracting morphine from the pills could done with absolute ethanol, filtered and then dried to get pretty pure morphine. The above steps aren&#039;t difficult at all even if they may sound a little difficult.. Refluxing is really easy!
