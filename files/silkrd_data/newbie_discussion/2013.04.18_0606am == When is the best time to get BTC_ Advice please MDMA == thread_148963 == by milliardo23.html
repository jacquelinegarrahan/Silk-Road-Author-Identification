				Ok so I guess I should&#039;ve bought BTC yesterday since they were valued 1=$70 USD<br /><br />Now they are about 90 USD! Is it gonna keep going up because of 420? When should I buy some?<br /><br />I use coinbase so I heard it takes 4-5 days so that means 420 will be over and sellers here won&#039;t have a sale anymore =( <br /><br />Any advice? I&#039;m trying to get some pills for EDC, mollies or maybe green bulls

				yeah, do the math, factor in price continuing to go up against what you save by sellers specials (and ofc how quickly you need the molly) and work it out that way.

				They were like 180 a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Only thing you can do is gamble and hope they go up. But I don&#039;t think any MDMA vendors are doing a&nbsp; 4/20 sale anyway.&nbsp; There are guys on here doing grams for 30 dollars.&nbsp; That is a good deal for most of us end users, for some that is common. But of course it costs penny&#039;s to make a dose, so the vendor is also making some coin.

				I assumed they were gonna have a 420 sale, oh well. So 10 x is about $115 right now. That isn&#039;t too bad

				I never really gave any thought to watching btc on mtgox (clarkmoody?) until recently but using a vendor to get me coin fast has worked for me in the past, I guess it depends on how much you want/are willing to spend.<br /><br />buy btc within a couple hours place order and done...when btc was more stable though
