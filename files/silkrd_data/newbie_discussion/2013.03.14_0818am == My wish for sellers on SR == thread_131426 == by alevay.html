				For all of the honest sellers (and I know you are plentiful) I wish only continued success, taking care of your families needs with money plentiful and satisfaction of bringing happiness to so many. I truly hope that your business prospers and that it brings you closer to your dreams of making good money and spreading joy.<br /><br />I hope for you that you never see the inside of a squad car and that you reach your goals in all aspects of your life. I would like to take this time to personally thank every one of you, whether we will ever do business or not.<br /><br />For the very few lousy sellers that are on SR, I ask that you leave. Please take your dog and pony show back down to the corner or wherever you crawled here from and leave this place unsullied by your filthy presence. If you are the type of seller that treats customers like dirt, cannot remove your poor mannerisms for the amount of time it takes to write a simple reply, and cannot believe that there are people on here who are honest and trying to be upfront with you...please go elsewhere.<br /><br />And for the sellers on here (ultra few) who scam honest buyers (as well as the scum ass bitches who scam the honest sellers) I believe that there is a special kind of hell reserved just for you. If you are too young/naive/stupid as to think that there is such a thing as an action that goes unanswered in this life, you had better think again. Life is a circle and what goes around always eventually comes around. Just because you get away with something right now doesnt mean you are free...just free for now.<br /><br />For you scumbag mother f**kers I wish a terrible life. I wish that you have the same self satisfied smirk on your face as you have when scamming as your cellmates d*** is being rammed up your little a**. I hope that the smirk is there when you rip someone off in real life and he corners you in an alley with no one around and gets his hands on you. I wish only that I could be there to witness when Karma comes for you sad SOB&#039;s, but I rest easy in the knowledge that it will happen.<br /><br />Why not change now? What kind of a person abuses this unbelievable site we are so lucky to have? What kind of a sissy little ******* ruins things for people on several different continents just so they can have their little scams to feed their CP/enema addictions? I wish only the worse for you, please remember this little writing when the time comes, unless you have the decency to change...in which case I applaud you.<br /><br />To all, please continue to use this forum and use it well. If you are scammed by a buyer os seller keep writing until people hear you!! People read these things and it is all&nbsp; of our duties to report the scum that violate the rules to protect other members of the community. Support honest sellers by using their products and get on here when you have a good transaction and spread the word!!! Reinforce honest behavior by rewarding it with more sales!!<br /><br />Yes, I have been burned...sorry about the rant, but this space is here for us and I like to take advantage of it!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE HONEST SR VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS!!!!<br /><br />
