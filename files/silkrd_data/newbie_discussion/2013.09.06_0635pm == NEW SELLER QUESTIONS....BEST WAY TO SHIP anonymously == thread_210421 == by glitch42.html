				I&#039;m also interested in the trade offs between the different levels of postage, express vs normal, tracking, signing etc<br /><br />I&#039;m specifically in Canada but I&#039;m sure information from other countries would still be relevant

				I understand you can order shipping supplies online for free from USPS such boxes and envelopes, then purchase postage aka stamps from a post office with cash or pay someone to do this for you or order stamps from SR etc, but I am curious how you go about getting tracking numbers anonymously. usps.com with a prepaid CC is pretty good idea... What about using stamps for paying for the postage but just printing labels with tracking numbers already assigned to them that are only activated once you drop them?

				Basically, the people with the best shipping methods aren&#039;t going to expose them by telling the whole world here how they do it. Too many inherent risks.<br /><br />The best vendors have done their research outside of SR, used some creativity, and then gone the extra mile.<br /><br />Trade secrets are very rarely given away in a Newbie forum.<br /><br />Just my 2c.

				Is your DNA/Fingerprints on there database?,&nbsp; Use gloves at ALL stages, Use a separate CLEAN packing area,&nbsp; nothing works better than super glue on your fingers (after you have packed all, in a clean well lit area) so when posting mail from a Main postal office, you should be safe. <br /><br />I always use different postal boxes offices, even go the extra mile to get out of the next county, I do this everyday. you should too.. <br /><br />You cant go into post offices, wearing Gloves during summer !. Obvious I know.<br /><br />I might be over the top here, about this All this but safety is paramount, on SILKROAD.<br /><br />So i hope your all PGP&#039;d UP TO the highest.<br /><br />Use AIRVPN.org <br /><br />pay with them with bitcoins!.<br /><br />ALWAyS<br /><br />Use a clean packaging area, and add a Dash of common sense!.
