				Hey!<br /><br />Welcome to our NEWBIE review thread, where you may place reviews when you&#039;ve ordered from us for all our products. Feel free to judge us about anything, constructive criticism is also appreciated, since this improves our business.<br /><br />When you have more then 50 posts, please post it in the general review thread located in the rumor mill section of the forum: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144621.0<br /><br /><br /><br />Introduction.<br /><br />We are Best Dutch Drugs; but you may call us BDD since this is easier. ;)<br /><br />Our mission is to provide you with the best quality Dutch drugs we can find. We don&#039;t offer lower-quality alternatives, only the best we can find for our customers. Products which we would also recommend to our friends. That being said; you will always receive top notch pills and speed from us. Once we are able to handle more orders we&#039;ll also provide you with other drugs, so stay tuned. ;)<br /><br />We ship worldwide (shipping is free, too) and will continue to do so, no matter the circumstances.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stealth shipping.<br /><br />Besides this we also try to stand out from other vendors with our communication and our (stealth) shipping. We always ship in non-permeable bags, so the smell of the product never slips through the letter. We are one of the first to implement this stealth method. Don&#039;t take our word for it, but check out this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0<br /><br />Although we have thought of and tried out various shipping methods ourselves, we are still a relatively new vendor that started out two months ago. So we know that we still have a lot to learn. This community is full of knowledge, and we understand that we don&#039;t know everything yet.<br /><br />That&#039;s why you can actively have you say in how we ship out your items when they&#039;re bulk orders. It&#039;s always good to have more input regarding stealth shipping, only this way we can keep improving ourselves in this cat and mouse game between the drug traffickers and customs/border control.<br /><br />Ultimately we also want to give back to this community with knowledge that we&#039;ve learned, when we have the time to do so.<br /><br /><br /><br />Important: Please don&#039;t post in this thread until our customers have posted something, this thread is only for reviews, no discussions please. If you have a question please send it to us on SR. Thank you.

				BDD is truly a great vendor, living in Aus, a country with rather tight customs has always disparaged me from attempting to order internationally, and after having a package from ChemicalBrothers containing 23 units go missing, this didn&#039;t exactly help. I found BDD from an area of the forums discussing the need for vendors to increase their emphasis on security. This forum highlighted how most European vendors only vacuum sealed in food grade plastics, whereas BDD employed the Mylar foil. After having an order of ten units shipped in successfully (with another 8 currently in transit) I can say that is clearly does make a difference. And as for the product, wow, I always knew the pills in Sydney were dirt, cut with speed and meth and other nasties, and NEVER stronger than about 80 mg, but I never could have expected the power of a Dutch pill, trip report below:<br /><br />2 different users<br />Experience- moderate users for about 2 years (drop about once every month or two)<br />Body- 60-70 Kg (130-150) pounds, 6 foot tall Asian males<br /><br />0.0 Drop half pills each, due to being apprehensive of taking 200 mg each<br />0.15- Already butterflies in the stomach, can feel that this is something like we&#039;ve never felt before<br />0.30- Starting to dance and get excited now, talking away like crazy<br />1.0- Full blown roll now, eyes rolled so far we can see behind us<br />1.30-5.0- Memories of this time are very hazy, did not take any more, but very very clean feeling, and people have told us that we were going nuts off the stuff, talking all sorts of shit and generally having a great time<br /><br />Next day woke up with no hangover (had used multivitamins, but even so, we&#039;re talking NO hangover) so clearly very, very clean MDMA and definitely a good synth.<br /><br />Absolutely we will continue to use BDD as our main supplier, he maintains great contact, and furthermore, was still happy to do business with me, even though I had just had a large refund due to the lost 23 pills from ChemicalBrothers. I love BDD, the prices can&#039;t be beat, the postage is free and comes PRIORITY shipping, so only took 10 days Holland to Aus. 10/10 reccommend to a friend, and I will be back<br /><br />

				the other 8 (split into orders of 5 and 3) have not arrived yet, about to release payment on the three before Auto-Final. You have to understand though that Australia is not a normal customs country, it is truly strict here. I&#039;m still new to this, but I&#039;m starting to get a feel for rather low success rates here, hence releasing the funds to BDD regardless. The other 5 were only ordered last weekend, so they still have a good period of time to arrive.

				The other order of 5 has now arrived safe and sound, the other 3 didn&#039;t arrive, but this is hardly surprising news. This is Australia, the other side of the world, a little bit of loss is to be expected, also, considering the street price of each $10 AUD pill that BDD sells is 100 locally, and cut with all sorts of other things, I can lose multiple orders and still be streets ahead in value, so I&#039;m hardly surprised. Keep this in mind any Aussie customers, don&#039;t be put off by the odds, if you have multiple clean addresses to send to, and keep your orders small, then all should be well. Honestly, after seeing my Asian mates go nuts off of a half, I&#039;m so excited to try some at a local club in the coming weeks. I will update this thread with my own personal trip report on the 28th, the day after I take one, just so you guys can get some more info

				Thanks for the offer BDD, but taking another refund for an order of 3 pills isn&#039;t worth the damage to my buyer&#039;s statistics, and I don&#039;t want to have a refund done outside the escrow system, becuase that&#039;s scammer behaviour, and when you don&#039;t ask anyone for things like FE or anything else I refuse to not return that trust in kind. I just placed an order for 10 MK&#039;s to a different address than the first, so we will see about the success of that.

				First off, I will say that I am a VERY pleased first time customer with BDD.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br /><br />BDD was very quick to respond to any messages I sent and kept me updated on the entire process from when my order was shipped to when I could expect it. Definitely some of the best communication I&#039;ve had from any vendor on SR. Also, that profile page. BDD probably has the absolute most thorough and informative profile page I&#039;ve ever seen. Any questions I would&#039;ve had were answered by the profile page before I even needed to ask them. <br /><br />Shipping: 5/5<br /><br />Shipping took only 14 days to the central United States, well within the estimated time and given our pain-in-the-ass customs. The Mylar bags are truly genius. Obviously they are very effective to slip through customs so easily. All 15 of the pills came intact in 2 letters. The letters were very inconspicuous and blended in well with normal mail. They definitely put a huge smile on my face when I saw them after sifting through all of my mail for the day!<br /><br />Product: 5/5<br /><br />I have not yet gotten to try the product since I have just received my shipment today, but they look absolutely superb! Nice, clean presses on the MKs and they have the same double-scoring across the back like the partyflocks for splitting. They smell absolutely AMAZING. When I opened the mylar bag I could definitely recognize that wonderful familiar smell of MDMA. I am looking forward to giving these a shot with my lady friend!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 <br /><br />I am VERY pleased and will definitely be coming back to BDD for all of my X needs. I&#039;ll probably wind up passing these around to friends and I&#039;m sure I will be back for more very soon! Thanks, BDD!

				15 days isn&#039;t extraordinary, but I was dealing with lesser postage times than that. Regardless of whether they arrive or not, don&#039;t be discouraged, I assure you that this level of quality is not even worth dreaming of in Aus.

				yeah, I&#039;ve given up on those 3, it&#039;s hardly skin off my back when 15 arrived safe and sound. Placed another order just a few days ago for ten more. Will update with more when they arrive, and look for another trip report on the 28th around midday GMT +10. Will be detailed as possible; aiming to make a definitive trip report for the dragons, as I hate just seeing basic ones.

				I got my order on the other side of the globe in 16 days including weekends. Not much to comment on this, though I have received orders within 12-14 days. But I cant complain since it reached me before I needed to enter resolution. So shipping 5/5 as I trust that BDD shipped it promptly after I placed my order.<br /><br />Stealth was not as good as I expected. I won&#039;t reveal or go into details about the packaging, but the bulge could easily raise suspicions. In the past I&#039;ve even had the customs punch a small hole in the letter to take a peak at what was inside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if the stealth is better for larger orders, but BDD is playing a wild card with the stealth he uses for small orders. Thus, I feel this is an area where BDD could improve on regardless on the order size. 3.5/5 for stealth.<br /><br />Communication was great. Very prompt and accurate replies. Polite and very easy to work with. 5/5<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5. Though my first order was just a small one, it was a good experience and I would be fine going ahead to place larger orders.

				I&#039;d just like to share my recent experience with these guys. I ordered 10 MK&#039;s and sadly they were seized by customs. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s down to a lack of stealth or just bad luck.

I had bought from them before and the shipping time was super fast then too so these guys get a&nbsp; 5/5 for shipping.<br /><br />And the pills are 5/5 too. I&#039;ve been taking ecstasy for about 15 years and these are some of the best I&#039;ve ever had. <br /><br />While it was nice to get the reship, I found the best thing about BDD was their communication. They were very prompt and very helpful at all times. I&#039;ve had a few shitty experiences with vendors on SR lately so it was great to deal with someone as upfront, honest and reliable as these guys. MASSIVE 5/5 for them.<br /><br />I honestly couldn&#039;t recommend them any higher.

				Hi, I did my first ever SR order through BDD last Wednesday 17th.<br /><br />I looked over heaps of vendors and BDD appeared to have the best combination of prices, choice, refund and shipping i could find, if you look around you&#039;ll noticed alot of the other big dutch vendors don&#039;t ship to aus, these guys do and there turn around time seems to be pretty good, saying that, i was still pretty nervous to place an to an overseas vendor at all, given none of them offer first time user a refund and shipping to Aus is apparently sketchy at best.<br /><br />I decided to be bold and Ordered 25 Mortal Kombats (unfortunately due to bit coins volatility and my bad timing they ended up costing me 3 times the price they should have :(, but still cheaper than Aus haha.<br /><br />They haven&#039;t arrived yet since it has only been 7 days since they were shipped. But i&#039;m hoping the will arrive in the next week, in which case i will be able to do a full review :) Ill keep you posted

				I&#039;m just going to drop down a trip report for you boys on the Newbie thread so you can see it before you move off to the general review thread<br /><br />Red Dragons/Mortal Kombats trip report<br /><br />Weight- 77 Kilos (170 pounds)<br />Height- 192 Cm&#039;s (6 Foot 3)<br />Experience/Tolerance- Middle (always try to take 1-2 month breaks, dropped maybe 10 or so times, but very comfortable with it)<br /><br />0.00- Decide to take the whole pill, night up till this point has been average at best, not very happy<br />1.00- Start to get some basic effects<br />1.30- Excitement starting to build, drama from before is sorted, which clears my mind for liftoff<br />1.30-2- Sitting in the corner of the club having a very serious talk with a good mate, we deal with some emotional problems that he was having, and both of us feel very good for having done so<br />2-4- Full blown peak has finally set in now, and let me tell you, nothing I&#039;ve ever taken before even comes close to what I felt like, Aussie pills are weak and cut with speed. Shivering like I was in a snowstorm, couldn&#039;t focus on anything, visual distortions and waves, excellent warm glow spreading through my body and a great feeling of love for everything around me. I did vomit at this point, however, it was totally painless and felt great afterwards, and its not the first time it&#039;s happened to me either<br />4-6- Despite the peak having ended, the afterglow was also excellent, no smackiness that you would expect from pills cut with anything, enjoyed walking around in the very crisp early morning air, everything still felt excellent, and then I went home and went straight to sleep, which is amazing, because I can&#039;t go straight to sleep sober, drunk or high.<br /><br />Absolutely the best pill I have ever seen in my life, clearly very pure, and there&#039;s no way I could call it anything less than an 11/10, particularly, if like me, you come from a low purity/high price market for MDMA where profits are placed far over the safety of the customers

And by clean I mean CLEAN, which means no illicit drugs or any other contraband, but more than that, whoever it is recieving the package must NEVER search on Google for things like Silk Road, or the particular item that you are ordering; further to this, never use your phone or FB to communicate anything about the SR with that person. Another great method, is if you know anyone with fake identification, then I believe (I have not tried) that you can set up a PO box using their fake details, keep the keys for yourself, and suddenly there&#039;s a postal address which isn&#039;t attatched to anyone.

				I placed 2 orders with BDD. It was 50 mk pills to 2 different addresses.

				hi all,<br />hi BDD,<br />thankyou once again<br />im now officially a happy, repeat customer of BDD famous for stealth &amp; fucking strong speed&nbsp; <br />ive never seen bdd fail - 3/3 success now, even during a customs crackdown! haha &gt; fuck customs.<br /><br />the service- orders always shipped within a matter of hours, and then a confirmation pm. <br />from the road to me in 2 weeks. hit resolve button, and received later that day. perfect. never a drama.<br /><br />product wise- this time the bag split open a tiny bit spilling about 0.2g into the stealth layer. only a little bit got lost, and a little bit of a fuckaround... ah well...<br />anyway, the gear is off white, slightly damp and stays clumped together, but dries quickly to fine nearly white powder. <br />i think the quality is great. very nice taste++. smooth comeup, steady rush. good long lasting effect.&nbsp; not very scattering at all. it feels clean. also, ive been awake for days, i dont know how many, but i think its been more than it feels like. thats good.<br /><br />Thankyou BDD, will definitely be back for more, as soon as sr is back up.&nbsp; you are my number 1 o/s vendor.<br />peace guys :)<br />ww<br />p<br />

				Ordered Mortal Kombat/Red Dragons. Being very experienced users, we&#039;re not easily satisfied. Experienced users meaning here: many years on a multitude of products. This is what we do....<br /><br />Male: 70 kilo&#039;s/1.74 length<br />female: 66 kilo&#039;s/172 length<br /><br />PARTY mode is on almost every Saturday. Mostly at home and/or with friends. We throw in 1 whole pill each (remember, long time users and very accustomed to our lifestyle/usage!). For us it takes mostly about an hour for pills to kick in. Same with these Red Dragons. About 2 hours in, we throw in another half pill each. From this moment onwards, excuse us for being Dutch. We understand our habit/lifestyle is uhmmm... different.<br /><br />We sniff up 2 lines of coke within a quarter or so after the half pill (thus, then on one and pill each). After the uppers, we&#039;re slowly moving onwards to the downers. At certain points during the evening/night, ketamine comes into play. We use nasal spray. Building it up with 1.25 grams/20 ml (our &quot;start spray&quot;) ending with the &quot;killer&quot; holding 7.5 grams/20 ml nasal spray bottle.<br /><br />Near the end we move over to pure ketamine lines and have our lights go out. Before going to bed (yep, it&#039;s morning by then) we&#039;re on one or two balloons/N20. Depending on our energy level we sometimes have a line of speed somewhere on the road. Sometimes instead of ketamine we trip on MXE or LSD. Depends on the kind of evening/party.<br /><br />And yep, we&#039;re still walking the planet after this many years.<br /><br />Now XTC for us is what gets us going and in the mood. We&#039;ve had many pills over the years. Most have very different energy levels. From Partyflocks, Ferrari shields, you name them. Not easily satisfied with quality as you may understand<br /><br /><br />BDD&#039;s Red Dragon&#039;s are as listed: clean, strong and excellent. Excellent, fast handling, in-country order: delivered in two days&nbsp; 8). Packaging (of course not revealed here exactly how) - good. Communication with vendor: excellent. Will definitely order again.<br /><br />Mind the notes from the vendor on the strenght of the product. It is as listed: STRONG&nbsp; 8). We would definitely NOT encourage our habits, remember we once started using as beginners - what we throw in on a night, kills off elephants. Because of our habits we know recognize quality. This batch of pills is top notch.<br /><br />Cheers, N+N<br />_________________________________________<br />Long time experienced XTC, coke, speed, ketamine, mxe, LSD, poppers and N2O users.<br />Resistance is futile. We are SilkyMe - The Dutch.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies. <br /><br />Just a status update: We were put off significantly in our work because of the recent DDOS attacks, couldn&#039;t get online for days. PM&#039;s are delayed for a day or two but we&#039;ll get back to each and everyone of you as soon as we can. We took a break because we wanted to offer our current customers with completed/in transit orders the same service as our new customers, but we&#039;re currently unable to due to the big amounts of work we still have to complete. <br /><br />We&#039;re also going to improve our packaging standards during this break to certain country&#039;s. Bear in mind we are still a relatively new vendor (3 months), but very eager to learn everything we can to provide you with the best service. For each and everyone of you which didn&#039;t receive their full order yet after 25 day, we can do a full reship to make up for the delay. And we&#039;ll attempt it with a few new methods too.<br /><br /><br />- BDD

				I&#039;ve forgotten to post in this review thread for so long, but I finally am getting around to doing so.&nbsp; I made an order of 25 Mortal Kombats a little more than a month ago.&nbsp; The quality of the product was better than anything I and my friends have ever had in the States, but I only received 15 out of the 25.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the idea of sending out multiple shipments for relatively small orders, like others have said, because I too think it seems to raise more suspicion when I&#039;m getting three or more letters, not packages, holding beans within a week.&nbsp; This was also around the time of the Boston Marathon Bombing and the ricin filled letters sent to political figures, and I wonder if that raised security on incoming letters.&nbsp; I also screwed myself out of getting any sort of refund by finalizing after the second letter came instead of trying to resolve when I never saw a third letter, but it was my first order on Silk Road.&nbsp; Mistakes were made.<br /><br />Overall, I give the vendor a 4/5 for now.&nbsp; My friends and I loved the Mortal Kombat logo because we all grew up playing that game in the 90&#039;s, and we loved the rolls even more, but the shipping methods need work.&nbsp; If I buy 25, I want to see all 25 in one shipment.&nbsp; I hope BDD finds a way to do this and comes back with new, reliable, and verified shipping to the US soon.&nbsp; I have a limited time frame in which I am able to do this (being a student with intentions of recreational use only), and I&#039;d love to be able to buy some more before the door closes on my little market.

				Got my order today after 17 days. Unfortunately the payment went to auto finalise but that was as requested by the vendor. Although I only made a small order I&#039;m still very happy and I am more than likely going to order from this vendor again. I don&#039;t think this guy is a scammer I just think other people have been unlucky with bulk orders.<br />Very informative and willing to deal with a newbie. A1 10/5 could not ask for better.

				Hello guys and girls,<br /><br />Round 2! Pleased to announce the MK&#039;s are back, FIGHT!<br /><br />In the time we&#039;ve took a break we&#039;ve stepped up our stealth shipping. All orders with 100 or less pills will be sent in one package. Except for certain high risk customs country&#039;s (like Australia) we might keep splitting orders, since we&#039;ve had very good arrival rates with sending envelopes to Australia so far. <br /><br />For instance it&#039;s a fact that they check regular bubble envelopes better then letters in Australia. When we notice that the success rate of bulk orders which are sent in bubble envelopes is lower then regular envelopes we might stick to the old method. But keep in mind you can always have your say in how we package your order, just let us know.<br /><br />We need to keep this a win-win situation for both parties involved. Hopefully this is understandable.<br /><br />All other country&#039;s will receive their bulk orders (100+) in one or more packages, we will let you know with a PM how we will send your order! If you order 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100, you&#039;ll always receive one package.<br /><br />We also have new rules, to make things crystal clear for you and us. Check out our page.<br /><br /><br /><br />- BDD<br /><br />P.s. Can&#039;t be bothered with people that try to accuse us of scamming, the biggest scammers are right here on this forum which try to give us a bad name, and then demanding reships and refunds outside the resolution center on SR itself. Basically trying to blackmail us. You can&#039;t reason with these people, therefore I do not feel obligated to respond. We always send out all orders. We never require our customers to finalize early, and our refund percentage is too high to make a profit out of &#039;not sending orders&#039;. If your order doesn&#039;t arrive, we don&#039;t get paid because we need to give you a refund..<br /><br />

I placed 2 orders of 25 pills to 2 different places and received only the half, 15 pills to one address and 10 to the other. I did the same mistake, finalizing before all letters show up.&nbsp; Pills are top notch but that´s not the point. User &quot;hahahaha&quot; had the same issue, he ordered 100 pills and only got 20.<br />I know sometimes customs could seize a letter, but only sometimes! Splitting orders is just BS and has no sense to put 10 pills on a letter where you can easily fit 25. He is not sending 100% of each order. One more scammer at SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It was just a thought.&nbsp; I don&#039;t blame the bombing or letters on my letter not arriving, nor do I blame BDD or label them as a scam yet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard (haven&#039;t confirmed) that the Netherlands is a flagged country in the US when it comes to mail, and the US takes extra security measures before sending it out further.&nbsp; If customs finds one letter containing drugs and sees several other that look exactly the same, it&#039;s pretty obvious that the other ones also contain drugs.&nbsp; Both of my letters were nearly identical.&nbsp; If BDD sent out all letters like the ones I got and customs caught on sometime in the middle of April, most orders were going to be seized.&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case (and I think it is), it could easily solve the mystery of missing letters and exploit how extremely irresponsible of a method that is for them to use.&nbsp; Hopefully BDD figured that out in the past two weeks and now make sure that things like this don&#039;t happen again.<br /><br />This is why I don&#039;t see them as a scam yet, but just a new vendor who got too cocky and made some pretty poor decisions, kind of like me with my first order.&nbsp; If BDD brings their ratings back up soon, I&#039;ll think about giving them another chance.
