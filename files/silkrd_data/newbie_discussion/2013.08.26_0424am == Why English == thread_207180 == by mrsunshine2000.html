				There are occasionally threads here in other languages, there&#039;s no rule against it. The site was created by English speakers, and I&#039;d venture to guess most users are still from English speaking countries. Also, as you may have noticed, like any other international forum or media, even non-native speakers tend to use English because it is the most widely used international language and provides the maximum number of communicants. A post in Thai or Romanian isn&#039;t going to elicit many responses.

				My assumption is because English is the more widely used international language in business. While Asian markets are growing substantially, the financial centers and corporate headquarters of the world still primarily use English

				Why NOT?<br />Take in cosideration how many members from diffrent countries are participating.<br />And its simply a fact that english is spoken (native) or at least known by the highest % of people here.<br />Several threads/offers etc in local languages would just makes it imporrsible to interact in a proper way together.<br />I also dont know EN too good, but its still my number 1 choice for places like this.<br />And I hope people accept that it may not sound as perfect r gramtically correct. But as long as the meaning is understabale, so what.....

				A large portion of the world speaks English.<br />Many countries as the primary language scattered across the world.<br />Added onto all the countries teaching it as secondaries, and the large amount of minorities that learn English in America and get booted out.<br />English is pretty vast..

I am sure that whole sites like SR in other languages/regions will start appearing. In a lot of places it would make sense to have a marketplace with only domestic listings, in the local language. Which is something you guys in non english speaking places might want to think about. An amazing opportunity awaits, if you&#039;ve got the skills to do it.

Everything works fine and arrived. No Problems. But only domestic. I think in the forum are a lot of threads where you can inform you…Good Luck!
