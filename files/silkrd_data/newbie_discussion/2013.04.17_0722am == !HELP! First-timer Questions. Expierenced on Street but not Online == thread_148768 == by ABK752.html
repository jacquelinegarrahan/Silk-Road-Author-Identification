				So I know what i&#039;m doing and what to do on the outside but when I came across finally diving into this underground road myself instead of relying upon other members I knew in real life, I had a lot more troubles than expected. Here are my main questions/problems:<br /><br />1)What is the safest way to use SR (not over the top, freaking out paranoid, just safe) and should I really do the USB stick method? <br />2)Best place to buy around $200 US worth of BitCoins (online or in-stores)?<br />3)Do you really need to tumble around BitCoins before putting into SR account or just put straight in once purchased?<br />4)When to encrypt messages and how to send them when buying, also how to read encrypted messages back?<br />5)Should I listen if they have 100 rating next to name and they say to FE because my first purchase on the Road?<br />6)What is a good rating to know it is a reputable dealer, and also signs of not being reputable or signs of a scam?<br />7)Best way to receive shipments and what to do with package when arrives (Should I really write &quot;return to sender&quot; on box and not open)?<br /><br />Anything that said &quot;should I&quot; were things that I had found from looking up online on forum answers and wanted to get second opinions that also weren&#039;t so outdated like some of the answers i found.<br /><br />Thanks for any help given as I am eager to join the community and become a good buyer on the Road. <br />
