				http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/05/patricia-cook-shooting-officer-daniel-harmon-wright-indicted--76457.html#ixzz2SWcREAVV<br /><br />A criminal woman rolled up her car window and started to drive away, while the policeman&#039;s arm was STILL INSIDE her car, and so he shot her, which stopped the car.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because we live in a sexist, man-hating society, the cop got 3 years in jail.<br /><br />FREE THAT COP NOW. He is INNOCENT. He does NOT deserve to be in jail. He did the RIGHT thing by shooting that criminal woman who was trying to injure him.<br /><br />Ladies, you try to injure a cop like this, and you WILL get shot.<br /><br />Welcome to REAL EQUALITY.

				If it had been a MAN that tried that- rolled up his car window and drove off, trying to drag the cop, and the cop shot him, NO ONE would be complaining. Cop would have gotten zero jail time.<br /><br />Where is all that EQUALITY that you women demanded?<br /><br />Equality means EQUAL STANDARDS.<br /><br />Why aren&#039;t you women DEMANDING that the cop should be freed from jail? He did the RIGHT THING. He shot a criminal who put his life in danger. The fact that the criminal was a WOMAN should make no difference at all, unless you are a sexist bigot who thinks that women should be treated different from men.<br /><br />Well, because I am NOT a sexist bigot, I think women should be treated the same as men. Male or female, if you&#039;re a criminal who tries to injure or harm a cop, the cop has every right to shoot you.

				Damn, I feel bad for that cop. He was just doing his job, and that stupid crazy bitch tried to drag him with her car. He was just trying to protect himself.<br /><br />It just shows how fucking ENTITLED American women think they are. That they can threaten a cop&#039;s life and the cop is not allowed to defend himself.<br />

				i actually spent about 5 min typing an actual response to this and then realized how much better that time would&#039;ve been spent just putting yr sad ass on ignore..&nbsp; what a fucking loser<br /><br />and yes you dumbass deadhead (10x worse than any juggalos), american women do feel entitled to WHATEVER, if by whatever you mean not having to be raped, harassed, assaulted, abused (and yeah there is such a thing as verbal and/or emotional abuse, you didn&#039;t have to hit her to hurt her), paid dirt and then told they&#039;re supposed to let a bunch of impossibly old ass closet cases decide whether or not they have a right to control their own body.. if men could get abortions there&#039;d be more clinics than starbucks but w.e thats besides the point<br /><br />&nbsp;good luck to you two i feel like yall would make an excellent couple if you could just admit how much you hate vag and go with the flow (that&#039;s sincere btw)

				I believe in equal rights for women. I believe women should be treated as equals to men.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that we should be sexist against women and treat them differently than we treat men.

				I am married, I totally agree women should not have to be raped, molessed, etc....I also believe in equal rights for everyone, when I say equal rights for EVERYONE that does not mean any one kind of gender, race or religion is entitled to anything special someone else is not. I respect your and everyone else&#039;s opinions, but like I said, just because a human being is female, does not entitle them to anything &quot;special&quot; the next human being is not entitled too.

I am FOR REAL. I think that women should be treated EQUAL to men.<br /><br />Therefore, since no one really gives a damn when cops shoot and kill MEN (happens every single day), we shouldn&#039;t give a damn either when a cop shoots and kills a woman.<br /><br />Also, very rarely do cops go to jail for shooting MEN. But one criminal woman who threatened the cop&#039;s life gets RIGHTFULLY shot, the cop goes to jail? WTF is with the hypocrisy?<br /><br />FREE THAT COP NOW. He does NOT deserve to be in prison simply for doing his job and PROTECTING HIMSELF against a criminal who tried to harm him.<br /><br />Since MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL, it does not matter what gender the criminal is.

				If the woman was driving the car at any kind of speed past a fast walking trot this would be attempted murder. Just imagine yourself with your arm trapped in a window of an accelerating car. You&#039;d panic pretty goddamn quickly.<br /><br />I&#039;m not exactly a friend of LEO, but he could have easily gone under the car and been dragged to death, a horrible way to die or be maimed. I know that it only takes less than a minute from hearing about similar cases.<br /><br />You don&#039;t murder or injure anybody for a fucking traffic stop. Nor do you intentionally kill people for something like this. Had he kept his head he could have shot out the tires or smashed the window with the butt of his gun. It&#039;s possible that was his intention when firing and he hit the woman. When you&#039;re in that kind of situation you don&#039;t think.<br /><br />The best explanation without literally being there is that they both panicked with awful consequences. A small piece of extra information in a case like this can tilt you too far in favor of one way or the other and that isn&#039;t a good thing when primary evidence is sparse. I feel sorry for both families, I can&#039;t find it in me to apportion more blame to one or the other. It&#039;s a rare case of dual manslaughter or something like that.<br /><br />The summer is hot my friends, and when you&#039;re not used to the heat you stand a better than average chance of losing your cool. It&#039;s usually best to control your temper in the summer or you&#039;ll regret it later. Don&#039;t sweat the small stuff you guys. Being a real man or woman is about self control when the going gets tough. Being more disciplined than the next guy/girl is what makes us civilized. If either of those folks had in it them then this wouldn&#039;t have happened. I seem to notice more and more people losing it recently for little provocation, it&#039;s no good.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
