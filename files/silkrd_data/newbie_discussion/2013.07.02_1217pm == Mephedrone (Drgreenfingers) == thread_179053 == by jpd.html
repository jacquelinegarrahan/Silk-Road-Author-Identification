				Just a word to the wise his drone was crap. I dont know how he gets away with claiming it&#039;s pre-ban quality. I was even eating on it. That&#039;s not drone or if it is it&#039;s very weak and washed to fuck.<br /><br />I feel offended to be honest. Should I just write it off or complain about his product because he&#039;s seriously misleading people on here.

				Sorry to hear that mate, I&#039;ve got 25 25i NBOMe in transit from him and should arrive this week, hopefully its quality though, quite stoked.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried mephedrone, how is the high actually like just curious? IMO be honest, don&#039;t give him a shit rating because he did come through, but add that the advert for it is misleading. I would put 3/5 but its up to you ultimately, if it is really that shit and you&#039;re experienced with the drug then by all means say what you want to him, Its best to be honest I feel.

Must have missed that one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did give him 3/5 Cant fault his service and comms and that&#039;s half the rating for me.<br />

				Good one with the Rating :) 25i NBOMe is a research chemical, it&#039;s a psychedelic. Taken in powder form or in blotters. <br />Some say its similar to LSD and shrooms but it of course isn&#039;t, but compared to LSD it is very cheap, like $1-3 a tab. <br />Apparently there are very good visuals, body highs, euphoria, other stuff, and I was very interested. <br /><br />Just a word of warning if you every try this, Make sure you don&#039;t take 2000ug/2mg or more your first time. Each blotter is 1200 ug (the ones Dr Greenfingers have for sale). This is because you can OD off this stuff, unless you have a tolerance you can increase the dosage. There have been reports of people being hospitalized and death because of this drug, but its mainly because they eyeball the dosage and take the powder form, thus fucking themselves... <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard many positive reviews on it and had to give it a try, i mean 0.25btc for 25 blotters? that can last me 6-8 weeks if i take like 3 or 4 a week! (yeah me being a scumbag). <br />Heres the link to it if you&#039;re interested http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4ee7455975<br /><br />Oh its taken sublingually or buccally, even intra nasal is possible ( the gap between your lips and teeth where you put chewing tobacco, or the back of the cheek, or below the tongue. One guy told me he puts it in his nose and it works well without any burning whatsoever. Apparently putting it below the tongue will make you taste the chemicals but i&#039;ll do it anyways)

				im suspicious of this claim, ive had many people after the free sample, or buying small followed up with 5g or 10g orders, why would they do that if the stuff is bunk?<br /><br />You can see the feedback coming in on my listings, i dont fake that.&nbsp; ::)
