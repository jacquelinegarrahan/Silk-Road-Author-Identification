				Just try to separate the buds first, then just let the air do the rest. If you want you can try to hydrate some of the buds. The only method i would recommend is taking a fresh marijuana leaf and throwing it into the bad with the stuff.

				It would probably be easier to just make hash or hash oil.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not too compressed and really dry you can add moisture to it by placing it in sealed bags with lettuce or any other wet plant matter, it will absorb the moisture and it will fluff up.

				I wouldnt think it was possible to be honest. I mean, its a plant, its been damaged by having parts of it bent and crushed. Just like any other plant, especially one that has been picked and is no longer alive - once its been damaged you&#039;re stuck with it like that<br /><br />If there was ways to fluff it back up, people wouldnt be bothered about receiving squashed weed in the post from vendors on here, but people are bothered and complain when they received damaged buds<br /><br />Unfortunately you&#039;re stuck with it like that. I wouldnt mess about with it trying to fix it, you will probably only make it worse or detract from it even more<br /><br />The best bit of advice I can give is next time either dont compress it or buy from a seller that doesnt squash your shit :)

				Don&#039;t go introducing any moisture to it you might get mold.

				Untested - but I believe its true, steam it for a while, then let it dry. I am pretty sure I have asked this question long time ago and got an answer like I said above, do some research on that though first.<br /><br /><br />Good luck

				/\ That seems it would work, as long as its redried efficiently. <br /><br />On small amounts as a kid I would throw a small piece of an orange peel in the bag to give it some life, only got mold once, but i forgot about it for some time.

				Not sure if its been mentioned but a solid container with the buds in it and a vacuum sealer to make a vacuum in the chamber.<br /><br />My old vac sealer came with a special container for soup or whatever and its perfect for it. Has a little tube that runs from the machine into a port on the lid of the container. Might be able to rig up a ghetto version if your creative.<br /><br />Or just use a coffee grinder to chop the buds after pulling apart if its for perso smoking. Just remember to scrape the dust out of the grinder as mix it through the chops. Its actually some really good &#039;emergency&#039; smoke on its own too as its all the goods that&#039;s been smashed off the buds so is potent but harsh and difficult to work with sometime. The grinder will fluff it right back out though and is the most effective thing I&#039;ve found. No good if it&#039;s for sale but just for yourself should be sweet as.

				I used to use a small piece of orange or lemon peel to rehydrate my weed if my baggie needed freshening up.&nbsp; Although it will get moldy if you&#039;re not careful.&nbsp; It can add a nice taste to it too.&nbsp; I heard from someone that it is a trick to make the bag weigh heavier too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lettuce or a damp cotton ball will do the same thing but be more neutral.

				Definitely let the weed air out if it&#039;s been compressed
