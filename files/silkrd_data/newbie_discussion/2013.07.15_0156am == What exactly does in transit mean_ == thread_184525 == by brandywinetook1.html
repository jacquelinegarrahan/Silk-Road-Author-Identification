				When your order says &quot;processing&quot; it means your vendor has received it and should be getting it ready to be sent out. When the order says &quot;in transit&quot; it means that the order has been shipped and is on your way to you (if the vendor is being honest, which hopefully they are.) Don&#039;t forget to finalize once you get your order&nbsp; :)

				I just placed an order here today(Sunday) and it already says In Transit. I take it that means that it&#039;s either ready to leave tomorrow, or they&#039;ve already dumped it in a dropbox. I&#039;m not going to get hung up on semantics as long as they come through for me. :)

				Nice to know about &#039;processing&#039; meaning they got the order and are prepping it to ship. Made an order the other day and saw it&#039;s still in &#039;processing&#039; and wondering if it was always processing. what does it say right after you make an order? thanks

				I&#039;m in US West Coast and the seller is domestic - reviews say they got shipments to the east coast fast like 2 days or sometimes slow like 10 days. Thanks for the tip, probably just best to wait it out at this point.

				I assume on SR in transit means vendors are processing - i know when i get an order i acknowledge it immediately and send it out within 24hrs. <br /><br />if you had the option for express mail and chose it - your vendor should also provide you with a tracking number - that is what i do, so you as the buyer know that your order has actually been sent out. <br /><br />in transit on the postal service website means its on its way... following up on those websites usually tell you when something is being delivered or not. <br /><br />Best bet - less stress - order express! :)<br /><br /><br />
