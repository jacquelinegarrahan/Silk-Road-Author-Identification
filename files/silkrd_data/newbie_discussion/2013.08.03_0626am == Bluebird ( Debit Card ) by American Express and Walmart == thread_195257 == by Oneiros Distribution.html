				Tried finding a thread for Bluebird but all I could find was a post referencing it: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133551.msg921158#msg921158<br /><br />So basically Bluebird seems to be an American Debit Card with a daily withdrawal limit of $500 per day and $2,000 per month. [1] The requirements to register one seems to be a Bluebird Temporary Card Number which can be acquired from Walmart ( you have to provide some kind of Identification, can most likely be fake as they seem to have over 500,000 accounts. [2] ) along with an Address, E-mail and Phone Number - all three can be acquired falsely without any issues. Now this is a fairly new service as it&#039;s not even a year old yet and while the mechanics of the card seem to work it seems to be a total disaster on other fronts like outsourcing the Support. [3][4] Anyone have any more information on these cards if they would be a viable way of cashing out Bitcoins or if there&#039;s too many drawbacks like massive fees and/or random &quot;security lockdowns&quot; ?

				I&#039;ve been exploring options and basically any card that can be reloaded you need full verif. which means:<br /><br />Name<br />Address<br />Phone <br />SSN<br /><br />You can always get someone elses info and use that but if it&#039;s stolen info two things can happen. Say if you have it loaded with $1500 and the the persons info you stole deciedes one day to get a Bluebird card and signs up then they&#039;re will be two accounts with the same SSN and I&#039;m sure that will raise a red flag and that cards fund will b seized. Because of the patriot act all Money laundering laws apply to pre-paid cards that are reloadable. Trust me I&#039;ve spent weeks and many frustating hours searching for a solution. <br /><br />You know what else is scary? Vendors who sell their bitcoins for a moneypak. That shit is easy to trace. If i was LE and wanted to bust someone I&#039;d establish myself as a reputable vendor of bitcoins for moneypak. Wait for someone to make a big purchase say $1k and up. Once purchase is complete send the MP and trace where it goes. All LE have to do is get an order call MP and tell me them we need all the info for this card with this serial XXX-XXX-XXXX. Picking up money at Western Union know requires ID regardless of the amount. The options are getting slim I fear.

				Ya the more I looking to reloadable debit cards, the less appealing they seem.&nbsp; Cash in the mail seems a little slow, unless you have a constant stream of cash coming in the mail. I&#039;ve bought BTC on localbitcoins, but I haven&#039;t cashed out with them yet.&nbsp; Any other methods out there? PM me if you feel more comfortable.

				If your wanting to Buy BTC then come threw me, I have them here for sale already and washed, If your trying to be a BTC Vendor and want to use the BlueBird Card the limits suck , you will max the Monthly Intake way to quick.
