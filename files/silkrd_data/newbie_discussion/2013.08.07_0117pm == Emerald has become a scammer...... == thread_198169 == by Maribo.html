				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br />I&#039;m actually quite surprised that Emerald scammed me as I once bought his famous &quot;Culero&quot; and ranked it as my all time best smoke.<br />It&#039;s obvious he didn&#039;t ship my product as I received other orders from Spain in no time and I didn&#039;t get any warnings from HMRC.<br />I think he might be targeting non-regular customers in order to cut losses from buyer scammers or BTC fluctuation. It&#039;s also obvious that even doing this from time-to-time won&#039;t really affect his statistic rate.<br />One thing&#039;s for sure, I won&#039;t be doing business with him again...<br />

				Just throwing this out there...<br /><br />But stuff has been going on in Spain of late that could be the reason for postal delays. (I could be wrong).&nbsp; Personally one of my shipments didn&#039;t leave spain for almost 1.5 weeks, but it since has left.<br /><br />Also, Emerald uses Hedging.. At least on the orders I have currently in transit.&nbsp; Which means he isn&#039;t impacted by the fluctuation of BTC&#039;s... at least from the stand point of the rise and fall between purchase and FE.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just a wishful thinker, but Spain had some national holidays of late, combined with the strife at the border and some nonsense regarding the Gibraltar straight where no doubt a lot of the product pass through on it&#039;s way from Morocco to Spain.&nbsp; On top of that Emerald has so many transactions a day, it may be getting to much for him to keep up with. lol<br /><br />It is possible that your product is simply still in the mail and not quite in your hands yet.&nbsp; But then again you could be right.<br /><br />But if it does show up, please come back and let us know. :)

				I&#039;ll just give an update (was away for work), The Spanish postal system might be slow, but not that slow. I didn&#039;t receive my pot and didn&#039;t get a refund because I was away when auto-finalize day arrived. The fact that Emerald has since stopped trading is another reason why I am absolutely sure he scammed me. He had finished his stash probably after he cashed in my btc. So there you go

				Guys, I just posted in another emerald thread... And felt compelled to post here too.<br /><br />Emerald does a huge amount of business and maintains a pretty solid rating...&nbsp; Emerald is not a scammer.<br /><br />Anyways, the large custom order of over 1kg of hash I placed has finally arrived from spain on friday....&nbsp; About 22ish days or so.<br /><br />Emerald in my discussions with him, has always been very curtious and fair.&nbsp; I have complete faith in him, and his word.<br /><br />As for the reason he&#039;s not selling at the moment... I can&#039;t be certain, but he did tell me he&#039;ll be back, he&#039;s simply out of country at the moment. (I presume he&#039;s on vacation.. or perhaps securing more amazing Hash).&nbsp; &nbsp;I will admit though since he&#039;s out of country his communication has been slow. (which he appologizes for on his vendor page.)<br /><br />End resultis... Emerald = Amazing Vendor

				When it comes to vendors I&#039;m real careful about saying stuff.&nbsp; Shit does happen sometimes and people can make mistakes.&nbsp; However, if there is absolutely no doubt that a vendor selectively scammed, then they deserve to get a little shit thrown on them.

				Or the kids can learn some patience and relize this aint walmart!&nbsp; Not saying this is the situation here. But more often than not with a good vendor like emerald. We will have a post from this guy in a month saying he got his order and doubled to make up for the situation. But like stated an honest account can be stated so others can be warned but everything should be taken with a grain or two of salt. Especially since we have a vendor seemingly on vacation.
