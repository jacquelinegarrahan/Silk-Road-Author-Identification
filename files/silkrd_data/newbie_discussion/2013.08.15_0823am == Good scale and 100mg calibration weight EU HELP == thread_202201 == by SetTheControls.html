				Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m in need of a good scale capable of measuring 50-100mg doses with accuracy. I also need 100mg and 500mg calibration weights because I really need to be sure of the doses. If someone could point me towards a reliable EU store where I can find these items it would be appreciated! :)<br /><br />Price is not as important as quality, I need a scale that will serve me for years!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />edit. I&#039;ve been trying to search for some calibration weights but finding 100mg for a reasonable price is proving to be difficult. How do people make sure that your doses are accurate in the 50-100mg area? I really need to be sure that the doses are correct, and volumetric dosing is out of the question in this situation.

				You can get a cheap milligram scale on ebay for like $20. It&#039;ll be good to within 5mg. You can pay a couple hundred dollars for a top of the line cheap scale and get maybe to plus/minus 3mg and then there is a biiiig jump in price for the quality lab scales that cost thousands that are good to a milligram. It isn&#039;t just a matter of money, it&#039;s also technique. You can&#039;t just toss crap on there and take it off. You have to use gloves and tweezers and a level and microcurrent shield and a bunch of other stuff. So the question becomes can you live knowing that you&#039;re within 5 migs of the dose or are you really anal, wealthy and have loads of patience?

				Thank you for your response!<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m looking for something between the 20â‚¬ and professional scales. I just want a scale that I can trust. I&#039;m really not that anal or wealthy, but I&#039;m selling a product that must be within 5mg of what I advertise. <br /><br />It would be nice to find a scale that uses 500mg or 100mg for calibration, I mean how can you measure 0.1 g with a scale that&#039;s calibrated with 1g-5g weights?
