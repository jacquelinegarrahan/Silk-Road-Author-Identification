				This will officially be my 50th message ;D and done so the good old fashioned way!<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to being able to post on other forums but I will keep an eye on the newbie forum and continue to help new users the same way other people have helped me.<br /><br />But on a really serious note, I wanted to thank everyone on SR and these forums. It has expanded my experiences of drugs in a very positive way, and people answering my questions on the newbie forum has also helped to keep those and future experiences safe and sensible.<br /><br />It just goes to show that responsible people who just want to expand their minds and have some fun can be smart, funny and friendly.<br /><br />May it long continue&nbsp; ::)

				This is my first second time through and I am wondering whether to do it properly or spam the heck out of it.<br /><br />My old account did not match my vendor name and was set up long before the 50 post rule was brought in.<br /><br />Hence I am here.<br /><br />45 to go...

				Ya. Its frustrating knowing that my intentions are good..and still having to be &quot;limited&quot; to the newbie forum. It&#039;s probably for the best though, considering there are a bunch of noobs out there who would be asking redundant/stupid questions that are probably answered a zillion times. ;)<br /><br />Peace&amp;Harmony
