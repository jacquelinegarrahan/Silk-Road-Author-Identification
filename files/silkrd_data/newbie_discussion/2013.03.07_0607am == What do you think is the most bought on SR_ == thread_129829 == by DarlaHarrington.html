				i would say it behaves like statistics -- the more used IRL the more it is bought on SR. therefore i would guess hash and marijuana are the most bought things

				id guess MDMA and weed.&nbsp; Weed bcuz its one of the more popular drugs and being able to sit at home in your underwear and order bud is probably something stoners dream about.&nbsp; and MDMA bcuz its a popular party drug and is fairly cheap on SR.<br /><br />Rx opiates are widely abused but generally I hear are $$ on SR and can be easily found on the strett.<br /><br />psychedelics are usually not as popular.

				I would say coke &amp; meth. This is just speculation as I do not know for sure. But I do know that I personally don&#039;t need to order buds from SR all the time because they are always available. Due to Meth and Coke not being available ever IRL I would say that they account for most of the actual bulk. A good indicator is to look at how many pages of reviews there are for each drug.

				Weed or MDMA, probably.<br /><br />Weed because most people smoke it... and MDMA because it is cheap on here and it is difficult ot find the quality you can find on here on the streets.
