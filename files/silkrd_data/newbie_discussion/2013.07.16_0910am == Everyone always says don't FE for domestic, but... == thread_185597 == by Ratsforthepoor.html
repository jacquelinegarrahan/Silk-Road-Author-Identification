				What about for your first few transactions? From what I&#039;ve seen most people want you to FE for first 5 transactions. Should I, or no?

				I say no Always been able to find an alternative for vendors that require FE. I&#039;ve done it once on a $30 order for an 1/8 of good bud. That was just because the guy shipped fast even when the road was being attacked. And I was feeling good at the time.

				Never FE. Plenty reliable vendors that offer good deals don&#039;t require FE. There&#039;s a certain amount of chance in any choice you make, but FE is an unnecessary risk. You don&#039;t gain any extra credibility if you FE the first five transactions or even a hundred. The escrow system is there for a good reason, abide by the logic that it represents. Finalize when the deal is final, it marks the end of a successful transaction. FE is like suicide, you cash in early without knowing what goods are coming your way. <br /><br />Just my opinion. Welcome to SR.

				Im reasonably new to SR myself (4 months now), I have never FE early. In fact the only seller that has tried to get me too (BudWorxUK), the item never arrived and they are ignoring me, bloody glad I did not FE now!<br /><br />Im beginning to think any seller that asks for FE should be avoided!

				^^ That&#039;s the truth.<br /><br />Not all big vendors require FE, not saying you didn&#039;t do your research but maybe you overlooked some serious players. My first purchase was a $450 international order and dude got it to me in four days. I guess it may depend on where you are, if you don&#039;t mind going international or even what you&#039;re looking for, but coming from the US I have found plenty of sellers who &quot;believe in escrow&#039; and page states &quot;no minimum stats required&#039; who also have (98+), over 300 transactions, close to a thousand fans. Granted, you got your legit vendors out there who may prefer newbs to FE and all you can do is respect that but they&#039;re not your only option. <br /><br />As for MDMA check out Symbiosis out of the UK, he&#039;s in the 1% along with Frank and only asks to FE only if ordering over an ounce on international orders. Prices are similar. Also mister m100, while not in the same league as the rest insists on no FE and offers competitive prices.<br /><br />Never FE. No disrespect to the vendor, because it&#039;s understandable where they&#039;re coming from, but don&#039;t do what makes you uncomfortable. Come back when you got some more stats and it won&#039;t be that big of a deal. No harm, no foul.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m done. My bad about rambling, full of that RockStar, Vyvanse, cigarettes &amp; Pex 2.<br /><br />Never FE!

				Yeah, Symbiosis seems Legit, i got 1 Transactions with him, and it&#039;s delivered. (No FE)<br />But after my 2nd Order, He cancel the order, don&#039;t know Why...?<br /><br />So I changed With Frank, and Started with Small Amount 1st.<br /><br />TX
