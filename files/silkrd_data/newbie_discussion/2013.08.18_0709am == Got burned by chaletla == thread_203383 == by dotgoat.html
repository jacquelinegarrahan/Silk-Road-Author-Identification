				So I ordered from them a couple times and had no issues, just as they were &quot;taking a break&quot; I messaged about placing one last order.&nbsp; They said that was cool and to send them the money, which I did by sending it directly to chaletla and giving them my address.&nbsp; Figured if they had a good rating AND I&#039;ve delt with them before I&#039;d be fine. WRONG<br /><br />So I&#039;m out the money I sent and I know I&#039;ve been screwed because the message I sent with my address still shows as unread.&nbsp; As well as my follow up message asking for status.<br /><br />Fortunately it wasn&#039;t a whole lot but it was still enough of a burn that even when they do come back I&#039;ll never deal with them again.<br /><br />So, lesson learned, even if you&#039;ve dealt with someone before don&#039;t EVER do a transaction outside of the escrow system.&nbsp; Likewise I&#039;ll never FE (finalize early) as you&#039;re just as screwed.

				also worth mentioning that with a recent SR update you can now see last login of stealth sellers as well and their last login was today.
