				Me and a friend both have Tor-Browser and I went to his place to chill, while i was their i went on SR and noticed the URL was slightly different. Everything was in place except it read SilkRoadvb5piz3r.onion.to<br />but by the time i noticed I had already logged in. so i logged out, removed the .to and logged back in, changed my pass &amp; pin.<br /><br />As of right now though. I can&#039;t seem to even access SR log-in page so I tried that .to extension. I made it to the log in, logged in and worked slightly OK. every now and again id have to refresh cuz it times out. but as soon as i can access SR&nbsp; without the .to i&#039;m changing my pass and pin again. I currently don&#039;t have any bit-coins cuz i spent them all. Only worry i have now is it somehow might have revealed my identity.<br /><br />Should I be paranoid about .to as long as I&#039;m within Tor-browser? actually......i forgot I&#039;m using it right now cuz the Forums time-out without the .to extension. <br />

				using proxies to access tor, even if over tor, is not recommended, and may be able to trace back to you in some cases. I suggest you memorize the URL, it&#039;s 3 simple parts<br /><br />silkroad<br />vb5<br />piz3r<br />then the .onion<br /><br />as for if you should be paranoid, don&#039;t be, you only accessed it over tor, however, still, don&#039;t use it. LE can pull info from proxies almost as they please (info like your username, what said username looked at, etc). as long as you didn&#039;t order anything, message anyone, finalize an order, etc, you&#039;re fine, and even if you did one of those, you&#039;re likely still fine <br /><br />stay safe :)

				The (.to) extension allows you to view .onion sites on clearnet...completely unprotected. This is not recommended.AT.ALL<br /><br />-Judge

				Never access SR with a .to extension. As others have said, this is clearnet. Change password and everything else and start again and only use the official url. SR has been VERY slow for the past few days. What I do is quit tor and start again and eventually I can connect.

				Well, I got an automated message from SR. my account along with a few others were victims of phishing. sooooo yeah, I just created a new account. Fuck it. I forgot my PIN anyway cuz i needed to install my OS and everything i had encrypted could no longer be decrypted cuz I couldn&#039;t use my old PGPkey. I have learned my lesson and have backed-up my back-ups and will be patient from here on out. Most of the info I had encrypted were memorized but I couldnt figure my PIN out within the 5 attempts i was givin.

				The operators of onion.to can read AND modify any information you send or receive through them. Look up &quot;Man in the middle attack&quot;, they are in the perfect position to do this.
