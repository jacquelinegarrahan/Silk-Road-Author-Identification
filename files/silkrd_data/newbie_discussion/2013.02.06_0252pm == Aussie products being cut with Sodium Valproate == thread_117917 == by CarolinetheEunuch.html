				Please forward this to all Aussie product boards (and the site mods).<br /><br />It&#039;s come to my attention that a number of the products sold in the Aussie section are being cut with sodium valproate (epilim). Now NORMALLY that isn&#039;t a problem - almost all pills need to contain some binder, and epilim is handy for ompressing into pill form. It also has very little negative&nbsp; impact upon most people.<br /><br />However, there is a minority of people, like myself, whose bodies do not process the ammonia byproduct from sodium valporate, leading to a toxic reaction that is rapidly fatal even in small amounts (I was very lucky to survive an encephalic condition - fluid on the brain - as a consequence).<br /><br />I don&#039;t expect folk to stop using it, as for most people it&#039;s a relatively safe means of cutting a drug, BUT it would take absolutely no effort to warn customers that sodium valproate is being used as a cutting and binding agent. Do you REALLY want an unavoidable death on your hands:? There&#039;s a very simply way around it - just let your clients know that you&#039;re using it as a cutting agent, and they can take some very easy steps to remove it prior to use.<br /><br />Withholding this kind of info just ruins the credibility of the site a a whole, and quite unnecessarily at that. I know it&#039;s byer beware, and since then I&#039;ve been (a) purchasing from other sources, and (b) conducting tests to detect the presence of sodium valproate in the compound. But I&#039;d hate to see a wonderful site like this die because a few people are too lazy to list the binding ingredient, especially when it is so simply to list. In a worst case scenario, you could even leave the product whole and let the end-user dissolve it if and when the need arises.<br />\<br />Please don&#039;t jeapordise the site&#039;s reputation by an easily avoidable piece of laziness.<br /><br />Many thanks in advance, and let&#039;s see this site grow as a SAFE portal for all things recreational.

				Wow, that&#039;s shitty for those with these allergies.<br />Good to put this out there, but I expect not many vendors press their own pills, or know what the binder being used is.<br />I would say, whatever pills you&#039;re ordering, inform the vendor directly of your allergy, and ask them if they know what binders are being used.&nbsp; If they are unsure, or verify the presence of SV, don&#039;t order.<br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;re already doing this to an extent, just don&#039;t take any chances.<br />&nbsp;:-\
