				I also use localbitcoins.com. And are you in the UK? There&#039;s a vendor called BitcoinsUK (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f76d1ab300) who I plan on using for my next purchase of btc has anyone reading this used them before?

				I&#039;m using a small, domestic website. It&#039;s expensive and you can only buy either 1, 5 or 10 BTC at a time, but it&#039;s fast. I&#039;m so tired of waiting for Mt. Gox.

				I used Coinbase for my first ones but that&#039;s through my bank so it would be traceable. Fair prices but it takes like a week to get the coins...Localbitcoins seems legit but haven&#039;t used it yet. I figure I just send them through a tumbler or something and then deposit them here so they aren&#039;t traceable, idk

				I&#039;d say bitinstant is better than mtgox. There&#039;s literally no one near me for localbitcoins. You can use their online service though using okpay etc. There&#039;s also bitcointalk.org which has reviewed vendors/websites.

				I often use moneypak for BTC transactions through currency vendors.&nbsp; <br />In the past I used SugarMama but they are no longer around.&nbsp; They would charge at maximum 15%&nbsp; (ie send $100MP, receive $85 worth of BTC.)<br />Most recently, I used a MP for BTC through HumboltGreenGarden.&nbsp; He is a new vendor, so in order to raise his stats, he offered a 3% deduction.&nbsp; ($100 MP, receive $97 worth of BTC.)&nbsp; HumboltGreenGarden received over 70 orders within two days of that posting, and he did not calculate his reserve BTC and a handful or more of customers went a couple of days without receiving their BTC.&nbsp; I received mine within 12 hours of placing order.&nbsp; <br />This method is not efficient for those putting more than $1000 on at a time, due to moneypak limitations.&nbsp;
