				Dear fellow SR users,<br /><br />I unfortunately think i am a victim of a scam from a vendor by the name of Slurvyman. He had too good to be true prices on MDMA and due to a few of his good reviews, i, as well as many others got sucked in to purchase a few of his products while also FE&#039;ing. I know new users should never require that, but because of my lack of experience on the road and his seemingly willingness to work with me and customers before, i fell for it.<br /><br />I ordered quite a bit from him yesterday of which he said he would get out the shipments promptly this morning. I log on today to an account that is no longer active, and all auctions have been taken down. Does this wreak o f a scam?<br /><br />Because i have FE&#039;ed, i believe I am shit out of luck, is that correct that i have no recourse after the money has been released via the escrow system? Sorry and thank you for any advice.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />a concerned buyer
