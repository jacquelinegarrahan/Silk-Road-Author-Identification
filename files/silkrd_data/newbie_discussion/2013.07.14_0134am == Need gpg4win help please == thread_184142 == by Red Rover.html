				So, I&#039;m trying to learn how to use gpg4win, but I&#039;ve hit a snag.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to import an Open PGP certificate.<br /><br />I went to the Newbie PGP Club thread, and copied Scout&#039;s public key, everything from &quot;---BEGIN PGP KEY---&quot; up to &quot;---END PGP KEY---.&quot;<br /><br />I copied the text into a Wordpad document, and saved it as an .asc file.<br /><br />Then I clicked &quot;Import Certificates&quot; and selected the .asc file.<br /><br />All I get in return is this message: <br /><br />&quot;Detailed results of importing [file name &amp; location]: <br />Total number processed: 0<br />Imported: 0&quot;<br /><br />Why didn&#039;t scout&#039;s key import?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it.<br /><br />Oh, and now I&#039;m getting an error message.&nbsp; First I got a message saying that I hadn&#039;t selected an Open PGP public directory, and I needed a fallback public directory, and did I want to make &quot;keyserver keys.gnupg.net&quot; my fallback directory?<br /><br />I said yes, and next thing I know, I&#039;m getting an error message that says: <br /><br />&quot;An error occurred while trying to refresh OpenPGP certificates. <br />The output from C:\My Documents\GNU\GnuPG\gpg2.exe was: gpg: refreshing 1 key from hkp://keys.gnupg.net gpg: requesting key [not sure I should post the Key ID] from hkp server keys.gnupg.net gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found. gpg: Total number processed: 0&quot;<br /><br />Everything was going fine up until this.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m totally lost and have no idea what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; For one thing, what is a public key directory, and why do I need it?&nbsp; I thought all I needed was my keys, my passphrase, and the public key of whomever I want to communicate with.<br /><br />There doesn&#039;t seem to be anything in the compendium about what to do if you&#039;re unsuccessful at importing a certificate.<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated.

				gpg4usb is the same way for me - but i just copy and paste it into the text editor window in gpg4usb and not try to import it via the task bar<br /><br />2nd issue i had related, if i save an encrypted file to a txt file like notepad etc and then copy it from there to a forum thread or an email, it comes out double spaced linefeed - i have to copy it direct from the gpg4usb&#039;s text editor window to the thread post or the email<br /><br />hope that helps

				If you&#039;ve already downloaded gpg4win then go into that folder and open up GPA.&nbsp; Look up a tutorial if you need one, but it is pretty easy to use.&nbsp; Make a new notepad file, put a vendor&#039;s key in it, save it, click import in GPA, choose the file, open the clipboard, type your message, click encrypt, choose the vendor key that you just imported.&nbsp; Good luck :)

				i started w/gpg4win- however it was buggy - would shut down unexpectedly- and over complicated- i switched to gpg4usb and it literally could not be more user friendly - also no bugs- <br />try it- <br />youll like it
