				Hello there everyone.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to ask a few questions about the silk road.<br />I&#039;ve done a bit of research, however i&#039;m quite confused on a few topics.<br /><br />Questions I have:<br /><br />What are the best ways to keep myself undetected?<br />How can I make sure that I will not get my package interecepted / traced etc. Or atleast how do I keep my chances of getting caught buying, say a large amount of a substance, extremely low?<br /><br />How do I get bitcoins? And what is the safest way to use them?<br /><br />Basically, I want to know the best ways to do all of my transactions. <br />The safest way possible, even it it takes a few extra hours.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about escrow, or PGP, so could someone explain that to me?<br /><br />IS there a place I can go to look up recent news about the silk road? And stay updated on things that are going on within the silkroad community?<br /><br />Please let me know anything else I may need.<br /><br />Thanks guys!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				get something like a UPS store postal box - they will sign for packages that need signage, and it is a step away from your house. Use your oiwn real address and info when applying, acting sneaky is more likely to get you caught than anything else.<br /><br />I personally like localbitcoin, and virwox when in a hurry.

				1. use legit tor not a clearweb gateway, order domestic from trusted older vendors with good stealth, check forums and feedback<br />2. localbitcoins or any exchange that operates in your location then bitcoin fog<br />3. escrow is just the site holding the money until buyer releases payment, or if there is a problem it goes to resolution where support staff can issue refunds etc. just learn pgp, there&#039;s threads aplenty set up for that very purpose. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0<br />4. right here mostly. twitter/reddit through tor as a last resort if the site and forums down. don&#039;t google silk road news...

				I suggest using tails. Google tails and and follow the directions to download the image and burn it to a dvd. Tails directs all internet connections through tor and erases all traces of everything you&#039;ve done when you shut down. For more info search it on the forums. Tons of info here.<br /><br />As far as vendors stealth. Read the discussions and feedback on their page. You can also read reviews on the forums here.<br /><br />Escrow is built into silk road itself. When you make a purchase your funds go into escrow, essentially a middlepoint where your funds are held incase there is a problem. You dont have to do anything special to use it. <br /><br />I dont use twitter or reddit. These forums are your best source for news. And as far as logging into twitter using tor, please dont do that. Or facebook. Dont log onto ANY social media using tor. Esp if you have another tab open buying drugs.

( its not difficult )<br /><br />may the road rise

				thanks for helping to explain guys. you&#039;ve pretty much covered it but a couple additional points; you&#039;ll be ok to start with tor browser bundle, it&#039;s basically firefox so not too overwhelming to get to grips with. download at torproject.org. NEVER log into a site that is connected to your real identity through tor, especially when engaging in illegal activity simultaneously. don&#039;t follow sr/dpr on twitter through your personal account. doing anything related to silk road on the clearweb with your real ip address is strongly discouraged. no twitter/reddit aren&#039;t good for news, they are the last resort point of communication should the worst happen and all else fails. don&#039;t go checking twitter daily to see if they&#039;re doing a sale or fixing the place up, it will not be updated with that kind of thing, just come on here.

				Use your real name, a fake one will just raise suspicions. And check the forums for vendor threads. Get the right vendor and it is so smooth it&#039;s hard to believe you&#039;re breaking the law.

				as a buyer you only really need to pgp encrypt your address before you give it to the vendor and any other sensitive info like if you wanted to tell them about a problem with their packaging method. it&#039;s just an extra precaution so only the vendor can read it and no one else along the way. are you a windows user? mac? linux? just so we can recommend suitable software for you.
