				Hi,<br /><br />so I was about to make my first order but when i read the chap i really wanted to buy from (had some personal good feedback) i find he has no GPG , well iv just been told again in another thread and of course read in the wiki that the sr internal messaging is fine without GPG except for your address and any other personal info, that SHOULD be encrypted but this chap had no GPG atm.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PGP Expired, please use privnote temporarily if you need to.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is it ok to fill in the address box with plain text ?<br /><br />cheers.

				If you&#039;re not worried about your security and vendor accept non-crypted messages, it&#039;s ok. I advice to send all the info as crypted, but hey I&#039;m not your daddy-o.<br /><br />~Q~

				personally sent plain text couple of times.<br /><br />please someone correct me, but if i am buying small amount for personal use, nobody is going to bother with trying to intercept or prosecute, it&#039;s simply wouldn&#039;t be worth the effort<br /><br />also, say you use the encryption, but if the vendor has to write/print your address and leaves the record somewhere, it&#039;s going to be found<br /><br />seems like security measures become an issue if the larger quantity being shipped, i.e. the law would want to go after you

				well iv sent it out now, just have to wait for him to wake up , although im about to go to bed , lol<br /><br />I would suspect that unless the LE actually fine the package which should be posted asap by the vendor then theres no problem, Its when the vender decides to store the address for nefarious purposes that you may have a problem and that practice is strongly against SR&#039;s rules.<br /><br />But chasing after a user in possibly another country with only an address and no proof they have ever possessed any illegal substances (as thats whats against the law in the UK, possession).<br /><br />Thats a lot of haste to catch a end user when they already know who there supplier was (if were talking vendor busted) , they only usually bust end users if there after the supplier.

				well i really wanted to, but this vendor is a great vendor for uk (by the looks of it) and theres been loads of sales in past few day and they must have not minded.<br /><br />If its of paramount importance why is this good vendor who must have some idea what hes up to not replaced his PK as soon as it expired :-/

				I shall just have to keep my fingers crossed for the short period while its being processed and also hope this vendor gets his act together , i don&#039;t really understand why he,s not sorted his key anyhow, its been a few days at least now, only takes a few seconds to generate a new key.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From the moment you submit your order, to the moment it is displayed to your vendor, the information is fully encrypted and unreadable.
