				Or look at topics in the Newbie forum that interest you and put your 2 cents worth in. Before you know it you&#039;ll hit 50 and be able to post elsewhere. I hit 50 and 100 in the same weekend! There were a LOT of interesting topics that weekend.

Keep looking around, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find lots to comment on as there are many interesting topics being discussed. Speak your mind, always be polite and respectful, back up any negatives&nbsp; with facts (and yes you can post negatives regarding the subject or an experience with a vendor). Don&#039;t take any slams, if you get any, personally. This is an awesome place full of really great people but there are a couple of &quot;A-holes&quot; who were never taught common courtesy or just can&#039;t control themselves and say stupid or offensive things. If anyone crosses a line with you don&#039;t hesitate to contact a moderator (look at the standards for posts) and alert them. Having said that, if you haven&#039;t really looked over the Wiki and guides it would be a good idea to do it.<br /><br />See ya around!
