				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />Is it normal for Vendors to not communicate with you at all whatsoever? I&#039;m a newbie, but I&#039;ve read the wiki, lurked on the forum, and have been using PGP encryption to secure any sensitive data. I have now sent to messages to 3 separate vendors about purchasing their products, and I have not recieved any communication back whatsoever. Is there something I&#039;m missing? Am I supposed to do something before vendors will talk to me? Figuring that vendors were just busy and that in order to get their attention I should just buy their products and then send them the information in the shipping field, I chose one that seemed reputable, had several comments about the product saying it was good, and a high feedback score on the vendors page. Then I purchased the product, and put my information in. Still no response. 2 days later, the packaged was marked with &quot;shipped&quot; but there was no confirmation, no picture of the product in its packaging, no message saying &quot;It&#039;s been shipped&quot; nothing. So I waited 2 weeks, hoping it would come in the mail, and nothing. So now I have 3 days until the bitcoin gets transferred to the sellers account.&nbsp; Yesterday, I posted a message in the resolution to the effect of this one. Hopefully the mods will do something to remedy the situation, otherwise I just got fleeced out of money...<br /><br />Is there something I&#039;m missing? Is there some way I&#039;m supposed to build up trust? Should I be registering my public key with a keyserver or something? I&#039;m just trying to buy a product without getting scammed, dammit.<br /><br />Advice?<br /><br />For those wondering, I was purchasing something from a seller called &quot;YourCannabisProvider&quot; - perhaps he/she will see this post and do something about it to protect his/her name -_- grr

				Yeah dude. The lowest rating I have purchased from after 3 months is 97. And I&#039;m actually having problems with that order right now lol. Most 100 rating guys are a little pricey but if you do some digging you can find some very good deals. And they WILL message you back. Use Short messages though. They are busy people. Many vendors will even give you the tracking number without being asked so you can see your package and watch its journey to your Doorstep. 8)<br />Don&#039;t give up. This is a magical place, it just takes time to learn the ropes. and money. It takes time and money to learn the ropes lol.

				I disagree about not using new vendors. I wont use somebody with zero transactions but once someone gets a few decent sized orders under their belt they can be great to deal with. They are usauly not swamped with orders and messages so they reply quickly and get your order out fast. Plus a lot of the time they have better pricing. <br /><br />You say you use pgp when communicating. I would only use that for your adresss or other sensitive info, I would say dont use it just to ask a question about his/her product. If a vendor is really busy they may just skip over encrypted messages. I would imagine it gets annoying to decrypt a message just to see a begger asking for free samples.

				Often new vendors are very eager to build feedback and will price listings accordingly and answer quickly.

				Its worth being aware that a rating of 100 is not an assurance of a reputable vendor (for the sake of newbies).<br /><br />Scammers will often add one or two 5&#039;s for feedback from schills just so they have a rating of 100.<br /><br />Obviously do not FE but ALSO a vendor at 97/98 in the top 3 or 5% is FAR better than one at 100 in the top 60%.<br /><br />Yeah, noobs, take note of that. More than anything though, just don&#039;t FE.

				Just like the feedback isn&#039;t the last word on a vendor, their percentage isn&#039;t either; the best gauge you have is the forums and reviews. If a vendor hasn&#039;t been reviewed somewhere, anything more than a sample might be a waste of your time.
