				Its just doesnt make the boards look good at all and if your spamming to get to 50 I think it just says that you really arent serious about talking and contributing on the boards if you have to make 50 junk posts

				I agree, but lets say, like me, I have a review to post for a vendor on their page. But less than 50 posts. Now I cant post the review. I have outstanding reviews for MIMM and WhiteShark and dutchaanbod. I have over 1000 BTC spent, just never really used to post on the forums,

				You should take the time to put something helpful or interesting.<br />All the spam on the newbie section defeats the point in the limit in the first place.<br />Just have some patience. If you need a vendors review page PM an admin and they&#039;ll make you one if you&#039;re genuine. That&#039;s how I got mine and I&#039;m not at 50 yet!<br /><br />BL<br />

				I agree with OP. Spam is not fun to navigate through and this board has a few interesting topics and discussions. There would be even more if spam was not allowed. <br /><br />But I think asking for 50 posts is a lot. I think a lot of people don&#039;t use the forums for that reason. IMO moderators should lower the post cap to 25 and not allow spam.

				i dont agree with you on part, but what i do believe is there should only be ONE spam thread, maybe pinned to the top of the forum so other important threads created by users does not get pushed down further because of the spam thread. <br />The whole reason for this is because of spam bots flooding the other sub groups with crap, its more manageable deleting shit threads in one section rather then a possible bombardment in all the sub categories.

				The 50 post limit before hitting the big boys forum is a little annoying. But i guess it does stop the spam somewhat. I have still seen spam outside here. :/<br />Though I assume that spamming bots dont care about much since no human has to do it themselves.

				op i agree, they should at least lower the amount of posts needed to post elsewhere to like 10 and/or ban spammers on the spot <br /><br />if someone REALLY wanted to post just to spam whatever it is they&#039;re spamming they could easily just post in noob section 50 times then go spam there brains out elsewhere only to get banned .. there should be some remedy as im sure the majority of us are not here to spam and only a very small percentage ever will... same as any other forum board really...

				I agree that spamming should be banned.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />It&#039;s pointless to allow them to be able to spam while requiring 50 posts to move on.&nbsp; It simply doesn&#039;t make sense.
