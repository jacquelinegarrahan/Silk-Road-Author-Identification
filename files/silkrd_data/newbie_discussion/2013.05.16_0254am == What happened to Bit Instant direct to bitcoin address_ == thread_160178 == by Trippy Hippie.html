				The first few times I bought bitcoins, I used Bit Instant by doing a cash deposit then having the bitcoins sent direct to my BlockChain wallet address. This worked quickly and flawlessly. Today, I went to buy some more and saw to much disappointment that a direct bitcoin address was no longer an option for where to have the money sent! Does anyone know why???<br /><br />(I ended up having to frantically create a BitStamp account and have the money sent there, which worked fine and I eventually got bitcoins to my wallet, but it was an unexpected extra step.)

				I&#039;m looking at that option right now, I use the same method and it seems to be fine to me...<br /><br />For whatever reason, some of their destination options for cash deposits go down occasionally, seemingly at random. Sometimes there&#039;s no Bitcoin Address option, sometimes there&#039;s no Bitstamp, etc. Sometimes BitInstant is having issues and is unusable for a day.<br /><br />It just happens, I guess. Good to have a backup now if you need it, though.

				I just used bitinstant for the first time and sent the coins directly to my sr wallet.&nbsp; There were no issues and by the time I got home from walmart (15 min) the coins were waiting in my account for me! Super flawless, guess I got them on a good day. Ive always gone with coinbase due to the fact that you dont have to leave the house but Id have to wait until tuesday to get my coins and this time I cannot wait. Glad I figured out bitinstant because thats def my new source!

				It appears to be back up. They occasionally remove that option while they rebuild their reserves. That goes for the various other exchanges as well. Bitstamp came back up today and was down yesterday.
