				If so, that&#039;s cool. Shall we become friends somehow? Secret handshake? Buddy poem? <br /><br />What? You&#039;ve never heard of a buddy poem? They are nice. Stop looking at the screen like that please. I&#039;m not fucked up. YOU ARE! <br /><br />We aren&#039;t friends anymore. Get out of here. GET OUT. Wait....wait a sec..<br /><br />Look..It&#039;s just been a long day. I was trying to figure out why I can&#039;t post anywhere..Then I realized it..Then I&#039;ve been posting here for over an hour..Why? No reason..Seems like a challenge worth overcoming. So..I took it out on you temporarily.<br /><br />For that, I apologize.<br /><br />We cool?
