				Listen, I&#039;ve been here about 2 years. Have over $15,000 worth of buys, have a couple vendor accounts and have some great friends on here as well. I just never got around to using my personal/public forum ID, that&#039;s all. If you are new here check it out.<br /><br />It sucks to always hear, do your homework. I know some people want to buy stuff right away and get it in their hands and I was the same way. If you are after a certain product, please do your homework and research. There are plenty of ways to find out about a vendor and the easiest way is to read the forums. Another great way is to reach out to the vendor directly. If they don&#039;t respond in a prompt time then maybe you should move on. Check the vendor stats. They all have them. If one vendor has a score of 95 and another has a score of 100, that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean the one with 100 is better. There are a lot of people out there you just can&#039;t please. And if a vendor has a feedback score of 50, well then, that&#039;s pretty much an obvious thing.<br /><br />Use pretty good privacy PGP with EVERYTHING. Even regular communication between you and your potential vendor. Especially when sending in your address when making a purchase. Make that a rule you MUST abide by at all times. ALWAYS encrypt your messages. Use a PO box if you can. It gives you just a little extra level of security especially if you signed up with fake ID. The PO box that I signed&nbsp; up with was ran by idiots or just didn&#039;t care about their $12/hour job. They never asked for ID or anything. I just filled in my name/address with a fake name and address and that was it. I&#039;ll keep that PO box until I can&#039;t. And since it is open 24/7 I pick up my &quot;stuff&quot; when everyone has gone home for the day. There are no cameras where the PO boxes are and that might be the same way in your area? Give it a try.<br /><br />Bitcoin! The hardest thing to do is BUY bitcoins. Well, I should change that to, the hardest thing to do is BUY bitcoins at a decent price. I have accounts on Dwolla, Mt.Gox and all the other places around. Seriously the easiest way to buy bitcoin is a cash deposit at a bank....damn, gotta cut this one short. Doorbell, friends are over. Will edit/continue later on.
