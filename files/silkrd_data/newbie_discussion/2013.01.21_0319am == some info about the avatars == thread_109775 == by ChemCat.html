				<br />thanks for the good lunapic link.<br /><br />i tried it with my 2 favourite avatars.<br />both are moving .gif images , so called mini-movies<br /><br />the resizing worked on both (though the first, which was resized from 150x107 to 65x50, had after the resize a bigger filesize! before it was 260 KB, after it was 385 KB. still acceptable, i think.<br />this forum here rejected the images (as beeing to big or no avatar).<br /><br /><br />ok, i took the second one, also nice, but not as good as #1.<br />however, this one is originally 100x80 in dimensions and filesize was 90,7 KB.<br />i successfully resized it to 65x55 , and the new filesize was 67,2 KB.<br />this sounds more than perfect.<br />not for this forum, though.<br />STILL this small and resized image was rejected by the forum as either being no avatar or being to large.<br /><br />THIS IS RIDICULOUS !<br /><br />the forum should, as good forums do, accept any dimensions lets say up to 256x256&nbsp; and any filesize up to, say, 1024 KB/1M.<br /><br />both .gif moving avatars are in their original size not big, and some forums accept them.<br />it is weird, not to accept them as they were originally, but not to accept them after the resize is inacceptable<br /><br />i think the forum should loosen its picture killing rules on avatars.<br />as the rules are now, you will hardly see really good avatars (moving avatars) here.<br />the resize and filesize limitations kill most images and makes them looking pretty ugly, you have to use <br />magnifying glasses to see anything (and still they are not accepted).<br /><br />i hope the forum will rethink its restricted rules on avatar dimensions and filesize.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				You&#039;re on the darkweb man.. try hosting stuff here anonymously. Like the SR.&nbsp; Then make sure everyone gets to personalize their forum account with a MOVING avatar.

				<br />i see no danger for me being anonymous and still use a moving avatar.<br />so being on dark web says nothing and has nothing to do with the problem.<br /><br />its simply a ridiculously bad avatar handling here ...<br />
