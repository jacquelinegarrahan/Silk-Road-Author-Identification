				Back in August of last year I was watching our regional newscast on TV during supper with my wife. At that time there was a story going around in the main stream media about Silk Road. What perfect timing for me to find out about Silk Road. After losing my source for medical weed, it was like a gift from the gods. After watching the news story my wife turned to me and said there you go Jim, and there I went. I had my first order in my mail box within 2 weeks.<br /><br />So how did YOU find out about Silk Road?

				My situation is pretty much like yours...&nbsp; As I get older and more domesticated my circle of friends shifted more domestic as well.&nbsp; Connections just started to disappear...<br /><br />Just like you, read about SR in blogs etc, though at the time I still had a trustworthy and safe avenue, but recently that went away too, so I decided to actually look into SR.&nbsp; On my 2nd purchase now, it is a wonderful thing.

				I heard about it first through word of mouth from someone that i&#039;m no longer in contact with. But anyone can back me up on this that if you tell one person that you use SR, that information can&#039;t be untold. I would go as far as to say that if you tell anyone IRL that you use SR you WILL regret it.

				Word of mouth...&nbsp; I told one person about it that I might regret, but I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll ever be able to figure out how to get on so...&nbsp; <br />At first, a friend told me about bitcoins in a conversation at a bar and then he told me about sr.&nbsp; The rest was my own research and the Gawker article gave me the url...&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d be able to find it if it changed...&nbsp; It was the Bitcoins that really got my attention, sr&#039;s a bonus.<br />I read a post in the &quot;First rule of sr...&quot; thread saying people shouldn&#039;t be talking about bitcoins.&nbsp; I get that at all.&nbsp; I think everybody should be using bitcoins instead their gov-issues currency.&nbsp; In Canada, our income taxes are used to pay interest on loans that could be taken from the Bank of Canada (our publicly owned national bank) interest free.&nbsp; ie. As a nation we could borrow the money we need from ourselves, INTEREST-FREE, but instead our government borrows it from private banks and we all get to give them 1/3 of our paychecks JUST TO PAY THE INTEREST!!!&nbsp; what?<br />I&#039;ve been researching the mechanics of $$ and over time I realized that we are all fucking slaves.&nbsp; Banks create loans from nothing and they charge it back at interest.&nbsp; There are no reserves so it&#039;s all actually worthless; we live in a debt-based system where money is created through bank loans.&nbsp; MOST $ IN EXISTENCE IS OWED TO A BANK WITH COMPOUNDING INTEREST.&nbsp; See where this is going?&nbsp; Where does the interest come from?&nbsp; Other people&#039;s debt $$.&nbsp; It&#039;s a big game of musical chairs resulting in the largest concentrating of wealth the world has ever seen.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been watching the effects of that get worse (forclosures, inflation, disappearing middle class etc..) for quite a while now...<br />So that&#039;s my rant and that&#039;s why Bitcoins are so appealing to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even that knowledgeable about bitcoins, but from what I understand, no one can create them out of nothing, control them, steal them from you, or freeze your wallet etc...&nbsp; They can&#039;t tax what they can&#039;t see, and as long as the gov keeps behaving the way they are, I want nothing to do with them.<br />Cheers, peace, and love-sprinkled spam

				I had never seen anything about it at all in the media. I was informed by a fellow acid seeking friend that there was a magical place to by drugs on the internet, but he was intimidated and unable to figure out how bitcoins work. A few hours of searches later, here I was with bitcoins in my wallet, ready to go.

				I looked it up on Wikipedia. I had been reading a lot on ancient Egypt, like 50+ books, and the Silk Road the caravans used back then. Then I googled it and came across the Gawker article. I downloaded the Tor browser, put in the URL and walaaa! Imagine my joy to find a way to get pain meds that bypasses the laws. I have crippling chronic pain and it drives me to depression. I have 3 Arabian horses and love to garden, and I can barely do that. In fact I will be growing more opium poppies this year for poppy tea next winter. I just really appreciate this resource and will do whatever it takes to remain anonymous and stay safe. I made a Tor email account, I don&#039;t access SR with out using Tor browser, I am in process of setting up an encryption program for communication with vendors, and I have shared this with nobody on the outside. Happy Days are ahead I hope!

				By looking around.. duh :P&nbsp; In all seriousness though, my story seems to be different then anyone else who has posted so far. While I did start off on public boards such as hip, bluelight, and drugs like I&#039;m sure others on here have, I was already well aware of what silk road was before it became public and stories and articles got out about its existence online and on television. In fact, I was already a member on much more secluded drug buying boards both public and private before silk road was even created for usage. <br /><br />Anyway, I wont get into much detail, but it all started about 3 1/2 years ago when my curiosity got the better of me and I started searching for research chemical sources/vendors after reading about how some were legal on public drug info boards. After being successful at finding loads of different psychedelics/chemicals that I&#039;ve never even heard of, I started to think.... hmm.... If I can get these drugs via the internet, why shouldn&#039;t I be able to find and buy other drugs via the internet. So I first started searching to see if I could find sources for mail order medical marijuana. It took a little time, but I finally found myself on some public board offering MMJ to others. Now,&nbsp; I was a little careless back then when it came to security, I didn&#039;t know any better nor did I have anyone guiding me like the&nbsp; newbs on here are fortunate to have. There was no bitcoin, tor, or pgp being used and the currency that was being used, well lets just say it wasn&#039;t the best idea looking back at it now. :) After I made a couple of successful transactions on that board, I was luckily able to find myself on another public board thanks to another member who referred me. <br /><br />This new board, had more members, more knowledge, and more sources for pretty much any drug you wanted. The board didn&#039;t last very long, but I was fortunate enough to meet some cool members on there which led me to new connections and to my new home after the board ceased to exist. At that time, I started branching out more, finding my way on other boards and eventually onto some private boards as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m fast-forwarding a lot here, but I eventually heard of silk road one day when another member on a private board posted a topic about its existence. I took a look and thought it was a cool and well thought out creation, but I had no use for it at the time. I already had reliable sources and could get everything offered on silkroad where I was and at a cheaper price.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will end it with that, but I just want to finish by saying I learned a great deal of knowledge from these more experienced members, and I&#039;m very grateful for that. You&#039;ll go a long way by listening and learning from wiser and more experienced members who are willing to teach if your willing to put the time in.&nbsp; O and if your wondering why I&#039;m posting this and not over at some cool private board, well its because the ones I were on no longer exist.&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; &nbsp;They are out there though. If you put in enough time and are lucky enough to meet some cool people, then maybe you too will find some place that you never would of thought would be out there. Truth be told though, private boards aren&#039;t as much hype as you think they would be. I mean silkroad has grown since it first started, prices having gone done on various drugs, and there isn&#039;t that much difference between being a member on here then being a member on a private board. The only main difference is that you&#039;ll find group buys over at private boards which means great deals on some gems and you have to stay active on private boards otherwise you&#039;ll be banned. So private boards= having to put more time into buying your drugs.

				curiosity...heard about it, but heard you had to be some kind of programmer and hacker to get in.&nbsp; Got bored a few months later, did some searching and read about it.&nbsp; Once I had the addrress and TOR client I was online in 30 minutes or less...so it is hard enough to keep the idiots out but not as intimidating as I was led to believe.&nbsp; It only goes to keep the mystique and keep people out to have the public think it is some secret hard to get to shady place that requires a computer science major.

				I found out about the Road from a younger friend of mine who is currently a senior in High School. He did not have knowledge of how to access the Road, or what its .onion URL was for that matter. I imagine he found out about it via popular forums and possibly the Gawker article. He is a smart kid, but has not made any attempts at getting on board with this community, and has never made an account, let alone a purchase. I travel a lot, so I figured it would be perfect to be able to have my products ordered and shipped to me wherever I may be, instead of having to find new contacts in every new city I arrive in. I found TOR, had already learned about Bitcoins from another tech whiz friend of mine, and discovered the URL when I found the Daily Anarchist report on SR. It includes directions on how to get TOR, and gave the URL for the Road. I have now made $200 in purchases with about 8 transactions, after approximately 4 months of being a member and a part of the DPR crew of scurvy dogs. I just lurked the forums hard, and lurked the listings harder, until I could not restrain my urge to make a purchase and see how things go. Made an order for 25i-NBOMe from the infamous Tyl3r Durden, and have been hooked ever since. It got a lot simper once I found a BTC vendor site that accepts Credit Cards, and uses Google Wallet for the transactions. This is great, considering the normal risk of fraud with any online vendor...but Google Wallet sends a one-time-use Credit Card number for the transaction, to retain anonymity in regards to high-risk financial and personal information such as CC number, CVV, Expiration date, and the like. No more hassle with Mt. Gox or any other Exchange where you have to jump through hoops to just get a few BTC for pocket change.

				I found SR through watching a video online about it then after&nbsp; about a week of research and downloading and setting up TOR I was ready to go, I made my first few successful buys soon after. I finally became familiar with PGP and know how to encrypt my messages and open them with the buyers and my own keys.&nbsp; so that&#039;s how I got started on the road. 8)

				I had just seperated from my wife and was back in the mood to get high, but being domesticated I too had lost almost all connects....good ones anyway. I was just google searching and messing around and found out about this on a drug forum, can&#039;t remember which one. I had no idea about TOR, the &quot;dark web&quot;, any of that. Other than internet searches at work and some porn (free) I was totally out of the loop. So I read the wikis and the posts on various sites and finally got there. I have been on there a year and only recently got my feet wet, I always do my research and always use trusted vendors. Veyr happy i found it being from bumfuck usa

				Well, after having received xanax stocks from indian pharmacies online, and a few other website for benzos, i realized that i could legally pull off this stuff. BUT none of these rare sites had any thing that was over a controlled 4 substance (ie no pyschs, pot, opiates, etc). <br /><br />I just google very stupidly &quot;how to get lsd to your door&quot; and found an article about the tor browser and everything else.<br /><br />NOW, it does take some brains to get everything going. You cant just set up the tor browser and start shooting out your home addy. <br /><br />I like how to become a true SR customer (being respected, getting freebies, getting deals, trading with trusted friends) you really have to do smart work.<br /><br />You have to learn encryption. You really have to be a forum presence, you need to talk to vendors, you have to learn for mistakes, you need to make friends, you need to set up a safe address, you need to have a very discreet way of depositing your funds, and by doing all this, you&#039;ll never get crap, you&#039;ll get the best product, etc.<br /><br />By putting all you can into the SR, the most you get back.<br /><br />AND for respect of this service, I will never ever tell anyone about it. If anyone ever asks me anything, I just say, I can get ANYTHING you want, anytime. I live a normal corporate life, try to be a normal as possible in my real life to keep everything normal and keep a % of funds to spend here. <br /><br />If you&#039;re down and out, dont waste all your money on here as a newbie, knowing nothing but how to deposit money and order, there is soooo much more to it than that. IF you&#039;re fortunate enough to be a part of this amazing thing, be amazing back.....and dont order shit you know will make you an addict. The smartest and most kind people on here, find the same. <br /><br />roth
