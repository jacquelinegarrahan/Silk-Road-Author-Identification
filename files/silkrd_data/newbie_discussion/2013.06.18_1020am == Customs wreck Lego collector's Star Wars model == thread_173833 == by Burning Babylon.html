				The article in question: https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5304484 ( A Swedish follow-up article which says he got paid for the damages caused: https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=128&amp;artikel=5406234 )<br /><br />It&#039;s a somewhat old article but I feel it warrants it&#039;s own thread because of the implications for at least Swedish Customs. So a brand new Lego Model in its original packaging with no drugs in it somehow gets selected to be opened, but on what basis? Here are the possibilities as I see it:<br /><br />* Hungary was flagged as a high risk country and they open packages arriving from there randomly on that basis alone.<br />* Drug residue from a nearby package &quot;infected&quot; this package which made a dog alert it.<br />* Someone has been sending lot&#039;s of LEGO packages with drugs in it, and they thought this was another one.<br />* They were under the impression this was a counterfeit Lego Set and were acting against copyright.<br />* The X-ray looked highly suspicious with many small parts which they had no idea what it was.<br />* They just opened it entirely on a whim without any basis at all, which they might do with any other package at any time.<br /><br />Which theory seems the most likely, or do you have one of your own? Discuss :)

				Receivers name matches or is a name that has been blacklisted.&nbsp; Opening the package and getting the guy to come in and claim it was the only way to make sure the name matched the face???<br /><br />But all of your suggestions sound plausible.&nbsp; <br /><br />
