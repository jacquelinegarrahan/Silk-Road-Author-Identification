				Hey all, I just thought I would start a thread here to announce I am open for business.&nbsp; My vendor page is in my signature below.&nbsp; I only have a few of my best strains listed for now.&nbsp; I lowered my prices because I am looking to make some sales and get some feedback.&nbsp; If you take a chance on me, I am sure you will be happy.&nbsp; There will be more options to come.

				Hey zobin, to be honest I would have to think about that.&nbsp; Anyone with more experience know about that??&nbsp; I did not plan to ask anyone to FE, and SR rules said not to ask customers to FE.&nbsp; But if something seemed fishy to me I might just cancel the transaction or something.&nbsp; Anyone else have input on that? I know there needs to be precautions against scammers.

				Hey all, I just added a bunch more listings, so check them out if you are interested.&nbsp; Send me a message on SR if you have any questions.<br /><br />Also as a new vendor I have a question for the more experienced here.&nbsp; I just had my first couple of successful transactions, and I received some awesome feedback from one customer.&nbsp; However the listing I made for that customer was a custom listing, so I made it a stealth listing when I created it.&nbsp; Is this why I can&#039;t see his feedback on my vendor page or on my listings?&nbsp; But I can see the feedback from my other transaction. Or maybe it is because that person left such a long feedback it didn&#039;t show on the page??&nbsp; I know I can see my own feedback when I am signed in, but how do customers see my feedbacks??

				Bump :)&nbsp; <br /><br />If any are looking for some high quality buds at a decent price, I reduced the price on my &quot;no-name&quot; strain for ounces, halfs, and quarters.&nbsp; This stuff is all grown from seed and has a variety of phenotypes.&nbsp; Sometimes different phenotypes are mixed in one bag.&nbsp; Or if you want something more consistent try some of my other named strain listings.&nbsp; To be honest the quality of the no-name strain is just as good, and sometimes I even prefer it to my other strains.&nbsp; These buds are real fluffy and dried out perfectly so you are getting a lot of bang for your buck.&nbsp; I have been throwing in some samples for my new customers as well.&nbsp; If you choose to order, I know you won&#039;t be disappointed.&nbsp; I already have a few successful transactions check my vendor page in signature below.

Customers will see your normal listings feedback both on your listing (if the feedback pertains to it) and on your main vendor&#039;s homepage. As you acquire more feedback and fans (member who bookmark your vendors page to their account for easy access) your top vendor % rating will increase, however if you receive bad feedback it will decrease. Hope this helps you and all the best :)

				Ah man, see you gotta kick out a selective gram samples of different strains to a random 10 people who are posting on your board. for them to get the gram, tell em they must post a very specific review of all aspects of your game (i.e. communication, shipping, smell, stealth, EXPERIENCE, overall, etc).<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen it happen. This thread will fill up with happy pothead English majors describing your product for everyone to see :-)

				Just got done speaking with HR about getting a sample of some bud. I messaged him on a whim after seeing his listing and much to my surprise I had a message back waiting in my inbox after only a few minutes! So far great communication, great attitude, and I can see he has a commitment to staying on the road and keeping his customers satisfied for a long time! Will be sure to update everyone itt once it arrives! Thanks for the opportunity HR really looking forward to doing business with you and solidifying your reputation as a great vendor on the road!

				Another person lucky enough to catch the sample here. This is a great new vendor guys. Order up! Was a little skeptical when I was only looking at pictures, but don&#039;t let that fool you. Packaging was safe and stealthy. Got a sample of the pink kush and the no name strain. These buds were in perfect condition upon arrival. Covered in crystals and long orange hairs. Both smells are unique. No name has a loud danky smell is all I can use to describe it. Pink kush does not smell as strong as the no name strain but this means nothing. The pink kush is very strong. Smoked a small bowl and was blown away. Very heavy high with lots of wonderful pain relieving qualities. Couch lock effect. The no name seemed more sativa as it was a very heady high. Both are of excellent quality in my book. High as fuck, no lie. HR has some really good prices for their products. I definitely recommend this vendor and look forward to trying other products of theirs.

				OK, FIRST OFF I WANT TO THANK MY MAN HR FOR THE GENEROUS SAMPLES. THANK YOU!<br />shipping- was very quick arrived in 3 days to the midwest. color barrier with vacuum seals.buds were not crushed or compressed package looked like it was from a business DISCRETE. <br />&nbsp;Im going to start it off with the strain &quot;SOUR&quot;<br />appearance- really crystally&nbsp; with lots of orange hairs, really sticky<br />smell- smells really piney, but kind of a hint of sourness<br />taste- just like it smells kinda sour but smooth<br />high- gave me a real heady high felt it behind the eyes.<br />potency- im an everyday all day kinda smoker and it usually takes me a nice size bowl to get to where i wanna be. After a couple hits i started feeling it, then i just got higher and higher. 1 bowl and I was good!!. <br />OVERALL- I would buy. you will find by looking at his bud its alot different than west coast weed. its indoor organic from bagseed so its loaded with the red-orange hairs and crystals. At first i was looking at the pictures but that does his bud no justice. Just give him a try you will be happy you did!<br />THERE WILL BE ANOTHER REVIEW TOMORROW OF ANOTHER STRAIN HE SENT MAYBE EVEN 2!!<br />

				I guess this would be a good way to initiate my never used forum account. Herbal Remedy is that dude! I left this review for his pink kush (and I also got samples) <br /><br />Peach and Grape were put into one blueberry swisher. Very heady high and extremely tasty. I smoked the (older) Hash plant strain with some hash that I got as well. The two went together perfectly. The no-name strain looks the dankest and densest of them all, and I&#039;m saving it for a rainy day. <br />The pink kush smells excellent and produces a great high. <br /><br />I left out the newer hash plant strain mainly because it ended up getting saved for last. I&#039;m in the process of smoking it with the leftover hash that I have. Also, the no-name was flame and got me really stoned and that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to get tomorrow ;) Thank you again

				Sorry about how overdue this review is :p<br />Product Discount, Low Quality Cannabis Buds, 1 Ounce = 28g<br />Wow, Im blown away by Herbal Remedy!<br /><br />Packaging was really fantastic and super professional, with 3 day shipping coast to coast<br /><br />Product is perfect for the price, good for smokers on a budget.<br /><br />I also received four very generous samples of PRIME bud, all labeled in cool bags.<br /><br />I really love this low grade cannabis; the price/quality ratio is the best for domestic weed on SR<br /><br />WILL BE BACK!

				Thanks FuzzzyYak.&nbsp; For those that don&#039;t know I had some lower quality buds hanging around that I wanted to get rid of.&nbsp; So i was offering them at a discount of $100 per ounce, and wow they sold out fast.&nbsp; I may put up some listings for some quality shake soon though.<br /><br />I still have some high quality cannabis bud listings, and I hope to put some listings for some new strains soon.&nbsp; I should have some Sour strain soon, which is one of my favorites but it is in limited supply, and maybe a couple of new strains as well.&nbsp; I also may be adding some hash listings in the near future, so check back soon.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been looking on the road for a good price for good quality cannabis, and from what I can tell you&#039;ve got it! Just put in an order for the &quot;grape&quot; strain, if all goes well you can expect repeat business with me!<br /><br />I&#039;ll be posting a review when it gets here!

				Thanks chong, sorry if the buds are maybe just a little dry this time.&nbsp; Next time the buds will probably be more fresh.&nbsp; You got the last 7 grams of grape.&nbsp; It is one of my preferred smokes and an excellent choice I think.&nbsp; When the buds are more fresh you can really smell and taste the grape taste better, but its still an excellent smoke when its more dried.&nbsp; I believe I also put some samples of other strains, but I forget which ones.

				Alright guys I got my order in today from Herbal Remedy. 7g of his grape strain, and he was kind enough to throw in some samples of his other strains as well. I must say, they are all wonderfully grown. So far I have only smoked the grape, but ill be sure to update when I have tried the samples as well!<br /><br />First off, I must say that dealing with this vendor was a wonderful experience. He was very quick and personally let me know when it shipped. And they were very generous in weight, including the samples! Definitely a vendor I will work with again.<br /><br />The product arrived quickly in a well packaged envelope, excellent stealth and completely smell-proof. No worries here.<br /><br />The buds themselves smell wonderful, with a lovely sweet aroma. They are covered in red hairs, and glistening with trichomes. And it smokes as good as it looks, with a hint of a berry taste. The high comes on quickly, and is long lasting. Puts a big grin on my face and lets you forget those worries! I&#039;m a regular smoker, and this got me comfortably numb with a single bowl in my pipe. The product is definitely a high quality one, and you can tell the grower took care in giving this plant what it needed.<br /><br />I would recommend any fellow cannabis lover to try out this vendor, I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t be left disappointed. Herbal Remedy definitely earned a 5/5 for me, and I will surely be a repeat customer.

				Thanks for the review chong1679 I really appreciate that.<br /><br />Demand has been pretty high, and I have been cleaned out of much of my supply.&nbsp; Right now I have only some 7g and 14g listings left.&nbsp; If you order a variety pack I will include some Peach strain with it.&nbsp; Check back in the next week or two when supply will be restocked. I will be adding more listings and possibly some new strains in the near future.

				Hey guys, I haven&#039;t checked this thread in a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wanted to let you guys know if SR is down you can contact me via tormail at herbalremedy@tormail.org<br /><br />Seems SR is down again now, but hopefully it will be up soon.&nbsp; I will be adding a few new listings in the near future.

				Hey everyone, just bumping this thread to let everyone know I am back in business after a short hiatus, so check out my vendor page in my sig.&nbsp; I have a limited number of 7 gram cannabis listings right now of my no-name strain, but I will be adding more listings including 14 gram and probably 28 gram listings in the near future.&nbsp; <br /><br />These no-name batches come from plants grown from seed.&nbsp; Always there are different phenotypes and variety between buds in every no-name bag.&nbsp; These buds are mostly offspring and crosses of some of my other strains that I have listed in the past including Grape, Sour Strain, Pink Kush, hash plant, and others.&nbsp; I plan to add listings for these named strains in the near future as well, but for now its just no-name from seed only.<br /><br />My buds are usually fluffy but potent and sticky.&nbsp; These buds are very fresh and covered with sticky trichomes.<br /><br />Sorry I don&#039;t think I will do any samples right now, but maybe in the future depending on amount of supply and amount of buyer interest.<br /><br />Also disregard tormail now, because of the problem with Freedom Hosting, please just contact me via my SR vendor account.<br /><br /><br />If anyone is interested in becoming a customer, I have had many successful transactions in the past, and my shipping technique is stealthy and secure.&nbsp; I will probably post a new thread in the product offers section soon once I get more listings up.&nbsp; If you have any questions or comments feel free to contact me on Silk Road, or here.<br /><br /><br />
