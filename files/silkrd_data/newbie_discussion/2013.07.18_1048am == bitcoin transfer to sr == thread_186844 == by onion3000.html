				Where are you trying to transfer them from? A website based purchasing/selling market wallet?<br />Did you get your SR wallet address and use that in the transfer details?<br />It takes a few hours to go through, usually, to the SR wallet.

				Well, the longest I have ever waited was around 11 hours and the fastest it ever was for me was around 3 hours. Unfortunately I don&#039;t really know what else to tell you other than that, I&#039;m also quite new to the scene.

				Are you saying that SR told you that you had insufficient funds when you tried to place an order?<br />That means the funds need to be transferred into your SR wallet before placing the order, so that the BC can be put into escrow.<br />So before you can order it you&#039;ll need to wait for the funds to register.

				Yeah as long as it&#039;s;<br /><br />-Buy BC,<br />-Transfer to another wallet (to clean the trail a bit),<br />-Transfer to SR wallet,<br />-Wait for funds to register through BC network and appear in SR wallet,<br />-Place order.<br /><br />Then all that&#039;s left is waiting for the package, which is even harder for the patience impaired.&nbsp; ;)

				does it say &#039;balance&#039; in your wallet with the amount you paid in next to it. then &#039;amount available&#039; or something similar underneath?<br /><br />mine did the same, it just takes a little while to clear in your wallet. it should say something under transactions or somewhere. it depends on which wallet you have.<br /><br />this btc transfer thing isn&#039;t quite as instant as sending an email or something. i just recently found that out, lol.
