				I just placed an order that required FE due to my low purchases, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be a FE button on this... I normally see it, but i&#039;m not sure if this is an issue from the update or if i never noticed it takes time to show up.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br />

				Once the seller processes and marks the pack &#039;in transit&#039; you will have the option to release the funds (FE).

				Silk Road recommends that you do not finalize an order before you receive it. If you do, there is no way to help you if your order does not arrive as you will no longer be in escrow. To answer your query, an item cannot be finalized until it has been marked &#039;in transit&#039; by the vendor. Again though, please understand that you are taking a risk by FE&#039;ing and Silk Road will not be able to help you if there is an issue with your order.<br /><br />Libertas

				DON&#039;T DO IT!! unless they are an EXTREMELY well trusted vendor it would be a very bad idea, im talking about them having to be in the top 10% of all sellers. I never had to FE and never will, just too much to lose and not enough to gain. imo tell us who you are buying from, if they&#039;re not trusted cancel the order and we can help find you a new better vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE.&nbsp;

				&nbsp; NO matter&nbsp; &#039;how new&#039; you are here,&nbsp; there ARE PLENTY OF VENDORS WHO DO NOT REQUIRE FE from anyone, you just need to start with smaller orders, &lt;$50 and once you&#039;ve got a few hundred dollars worth of sales in your stats, Most vendors will talk with you.<br /><br />&nbsp; The FIRST RULE OF TSR is&nbsp; &quot;NEVER FE, NEVER EEVR EVER FE, No matter HOW MUCH you&nbsp; might want the dope .... NEVER FE ...<br />&nbsp;IF they want you to FE, find another vendor asap, who will use escrow ... like I saidm there ARE many &#039;good vendors&#039; here, YOU just NEED to DO your homework to find out who they are!<br /><br />&nbsp; PM them, with the heading &quot;New buyer&quot; and explain that you want to&nbsp; &quot;keep the rules of The Road, out of respect for the system and DPR, and wish to use the escrow system&quot; .. which works BOTH ways with BOTH buyers and vendors alike, having to trust The Silk Road&#039;s system!<br /><br />&nbsp;Well known vendors that had been here over a year, with &quot;perfect stats and heaps of great reviews&quot; turned into some of THE BIGGEST scammers!!&nbsp; who scammed MANY &#039;old customers&#039;:o :o<br /><br />&nbsp;IMO you just need to spend a few more hours reading up in the forum, esp &#039;The Rumor Mill&#039; to &#039;check out the vendor&#039; AND the &#039;scammers threads&#039; and just read around and try to pick up ideas from other peoples comments ... you WILL really get a much better result by doing you &#039;forum homework&#039; ... it could save you a LOT of dough<br /><br />In fact just yesterday I got a pm from a dude who read all 27 pages of a review thread on a vendor who had been here over 1 yr, has around 100 transactions, AND a 100 rating!&nbsp; &nbsp;but IMO after seeing what he was selling, and the prices he was asking, just screamed to me, he was just scamming &#039;impressional&#039; (and possibly) ignorant people with dreams and bullshit :o<br /><br />His ads read like something you&#039;d hear on TV!&nbsp; Remember&nbsp; &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;?&nbsp; Not as bad as that, but classic &#039;it&#039;s your lucky day, make thousands in NO time at all,. Anyone who&#039;s good with their hands, and likes to tinker, thenn THIS IS FOR YOU!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;type shit!&nbsp; Which annoyed me!<br /><br />&quot;They&#039;re MAY BE a &#039;sucker born every minute&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT ,,&nbsp; That&#039;s NO reason we &#039;should&#039; take advantage of them!&nbsp; And this cunt IS doing that ... he&#039;s still trading with a 100% rating!&nbsp; :o&nbsp; Go figure? :-\<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; SO I joined in the thread&nbsp; asking other members IF they&#039;d used his product and did it &#039;work?&#039;&nbsp; And then we started to ask him some &#039;tricky questions&#039; about the &#039;specifics&#039; of his methods, which he just ducked and weaved and avoided answering, instead &quot;calling me&quot; pretty much every nasty cheap shot he could think up<br /><br />ANyway, that was a few months ago so to get this pm yesterday, was pretty cool, coz I know he&#039;s just one of many, who was &#039;smart enough to notice&#039;&nbsp; and cool enough that he&nbsp; &quot;could be bothered to pm a thank you to me&quot; ..&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; Yet most of what he was selling was &#039;bullshit&#039; and&nbsp; (also easily available on the &#039;clearweb&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;I debated with him , I&nbsp; argued with him about the &#039;specifics&#039; (which he wouldn&#039;t/couldn&#039;t) answer but this dude and his &#039;fans&#039; who called me all sorts of things and TRIED to tell me &quot;I didn&#039;t know what I was talking about hassled me for weeks<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT BUT BUT ....<br />IF what I DID &quot;stopped JUST ONE person from &quot;throwing away $6-800 for papers they wouldn&#039;t understand OR be able to use ... It would be &quot;worth it&quot;&nbsp; (even the &#039;death threat&#039; :o :o ::))<br /><br />Well, after 27 pages I figured I&#039;d done enough, by page 10 it was clear this guy&#039;s a scammer,&nbsp; and IF people were either too lazy to bother checking out the vendors in the forum!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Life saver!<br />« Sent to: motek on: June 29, 2013, 04:47 am »<br />« You have forwarded or responded to this message. »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br /><br />Dude...<br /><br />thanks for saving me 600 bucks!&nbsp; I was JUST about to transfer BC into my SR wallet to buy the guide.....but was thankfully smart enough to read ALL 36 pages of the thread about him and saw the truth in the end.&nbsp; I just wanted to say thanks for not quitting when it was only you telling the truth....you really did just save me 600 bucks hahaha......wife woulda been PISSED<br /><br />Still looking for these fabulous site everyone is talking about....the darkweb is still pretty new to me haha.<br /><br /><br />Cheers man!<br /><br />Truely </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br /><br />So, the bottom line is, take your time and take it slowly and steady,<br />&nbsp;DO NOT EVER FE,&nbsp; DO NOT EVER FINALIZE EARLY, follow the other&nbsp; &#039;suggested safety guidelines&#039; learnh PGP&nbsp; and you&#039;ll probably be fine ... and learn, learn learn what you can from the forums, they&#039;re are a LOT of very cool members here 8)<br /><br />all the best<br /><br />cheers m m m motek ;)

				Phase only has large listings available at the moment. By finalising early you are taking a financial risk.<br /><br />Only you can decide what to do from here, but I can tell you that if you want 10g MDMA or more, no-one is going to allow you to do that without finalising early if you&#039;re new.<br /><br />So either FE and accept the risk, or message phase to apologise and politely explain that you have decided not to go ahead as you have been convinced on the forum it is not a good idea to FE on such a large amount.<br /><br />Then make some smaller deals with other vendors who don&#039;t require FE.<br />
