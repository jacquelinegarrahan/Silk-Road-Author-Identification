When will you get a picture of your coke on your listing ideally with your vendor&#039;s name next to it? It might give me the confidence to take the plunge. I&#039;d be able to EZ Test your coke both for cut and purity to help prove you have &#039;the best quality&#039; cocaine if your claim is true. I wish you all the best with your new venture :)

				And you can afford to give away 100 samples but not sell at a price which is going to force other coke sellers on the road to either lower their own prices or get no sales or leave? Would it not be better to sell cheaper than the competition and reap the benefits from the sheer volume of orders you receive rather than pricing high and being in the same boat as other dealers on here?<br /><br />If your genuine that is.......<br /><br />I really want to believe that you are going to be a great vendor bringing quality product to the road but.... Sending 100 free 1g samples seems.. well overly generous. It could be a very good way to harvest hundreds of addresses without sending a single gram of product because every one will be biting your hand of for such a deal. Or... It could be a good way to get a lot of feedback quickly on the site before listing at price, FE for trusted seller and boom the scam begins. <br /><br />Coke is one of those drugs that people are going to love to buy, giving a potential scammer a big client-base. Like I say I hope I&#039;m wrong but... Like the old saying goes...If it seems to good to be true it probably is. It just reminds me of the way the lsd gummies scam ran for anyone who was around then. In fact, it seems EXACTLY the same just with a different drug. I hate screaming LE or Scammer at new vendors and maybe I&#039;m being overly paranoid.. Can anyone else see what I am saying?<br /><br />Please for gods sake nobody FE until some of these samples are received!<br /><br />Like I say I hope I&#039;m wrong, will be keeping a close eye on this one.. As soon as feedback is received for some samples it will make me feel a a little better about this... Not much,, But a little.<br /><br />

				We think the price is fair and we also think the best way to promote our products is to offer samples. And when samples are received you will see there is no tricks we just want to sell drugs like every other vendor we just want to sell better drugs. And we also believe in the saying quality over quantity and that is what you will get from us.

More samples for rest of the world just being added so get your orders in. More cocaine samples to be listed asap maybe tomorrow and that will include the rest of the world. Orders not in transit to be packed shortly so please bear with us.

Please fan us and when everyone receives please do your part and leave feedback it only takes a minute we took the time to package and send your sample so it is only fair you fulfill your side of the deal.

				It appears that people who meet the criteria *are* receiving samples, whereas tricksters who are trying it on, are getting nothing.<br /><br />Good. That&#039;s how it should be. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve taken the plunge and snapped up one of the relisted coke samples.<br /><br />I meet the criteria, so my order has gone through.<br /><br />My sample is going to a drop. I will confirm it&#039;s arrival in this thread as soon as it arrives, but my actual product review will be a few days behind this - after I&#039;ve been and collected it.<br /><br />Either way, I will keep you all posted. Watch this space. <br />

				Same here..I ordered a sample and it was marked in transit yesterday. Once I have received the product (very very generous ) I will update. My review will be prompt and professional as promised! <br />And seriously people, if you received a sample you really need to uphold your end of the bargain. Who the hell else ever sold you a gram of coke for under 1 fucking dollar? Exactly! Now play your part and post a review...

				I actually ordered the sample twice by accident i informed theXchange of my mistake and he sent me both samples anyway i have not received them yet but it&#039;s only been a couple of days and i am overseas so that&#039;s really no suprise... i will definitely be writing a review after i receive my sample i am fairly confident this is all legit seems like some people are just mad they didn&#039;t get sent a sample.

Im pretty sure thats the first thing feds try to do on markets like this. u know they investigating, that includes the vendor section aswell. and if they find a way, just like u did in my opinion, they will not let go and keep trying. Yer, u see how much certain people bought based on their stats, and then if u see they bought quite a lot u checking this data with people who try and buy coke from here and then u have probably enough evidence to try and raid the guys. it is very possible how i see it.<br />anyway, everyone can decide on his own. facts talking for themselves.

				&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Well, I don&#039;t think this guy is LE! LE don&#039;t send grams of primo snort in the post, guys!<br />&nbsp;I had some communication with the vendor before the package was sent and he was prompt to reply and courteous.<br /><br />My sample arrived today, it took a while but the postie has been conspicuous through his absence for some days now , due to the weather.<br /><br />Stealth, meh... not great tbh, I guess (hope) the vendor was in a hurry getting his samples out. I PM&#039;d him on the road with the details, so I would expect to see that improve.<br /><br />An overly generous sample, 0.96 on my scales,&nbsp; but I only paid 0.01BC, so for UK, it was a very bold move indeed.<br /><br />Bagged and sealed, I would say the inner packaging was good, not foil/mylar type bags that everyone is shouting about, but good enough, it was only the outer packaging that let it down.<br /><br />Inside; scaly, shiny, iridescent, cocaine smelling loveliness! Looks exactly like fish scale gear I get from another vendor except this is kinda soft and sticky where the fish scale I usually buy is rock hard and hard to grind, a little piece is drying under the lamp now, to see what happens........ as predicted, after a few minutes, it has hardened and crushes readily to a nice dry powder.<br /><br />It does have a little twang of taste and smell that I&#039;d normally associate with a cut that used to be very common but I have no way to test and this is purely a subjective notion on my part.<br /><br />A small piece dissolves instantly on my fingers and leaves a very light and vague oily residue, my lips and gums tingle and numb lightly but very quickly.<br /><br />Up the snoz then,&nbsp; ;D and it&#039;s great, like tooting air (that smells like cocaine) no sting, nothing unpleasant. Perfect, predictable rush comes on after 2-3 minutes and the very slight drip in my throat tastes and feels just right.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had Lloydsbrothers so far from the U.K. it was fantastic, if a little expensive, but this is just as good. <br /><br />I see the vendor now has grams on his page at BC2.65, which is a little high, even when compared with the other U.K. vendors. <br /><br />Bad luck if you missed out on these samples, everyone. Sometimes you have to take a chance to get the good things in life, I guess!<br /><br />In conclusion then; the C is tip top, that vague odor may just be my imagination because I got a great hit from this gear.<br />Outer packaging wasn&#039;t the best but can be easily improved.<br />Sample was very generous and I will definitely make a purchase from this vendor as a thanks.<br /><br /><br />

				Update: <br /><br />I too received my sample today. <br /><br />Weighed in at approx 1g, crunchy white granules, looks good, smells good.<br /><br />Rubbed a teeny tiny bit on my gums about 20 minutes ago.<br />Definitely the real deal, and rather nice. :D <br /><br />Will give it a proper test this weekend, but yeah, the vendor delivered on his promise.<br /><br />Maybe some people will give him some slack now.<br /><br /><br />Packaging needs attention however. Asap.<br />Nowhere near stealthy enough imo.<br />Hiding in plain sight is one thing, but this was just a bit *too* relaxed.&nbsp; <br />But that aside, all is well.<br /><br />Cheers Xchange. <br /><br />

				No updates in this thread?<br />Okay so I&#039;m updating: My Benzo-sample took a bit longer to arrive at my drop but this is the second item that successfully arrived to the EU for me.<br /><br />You&#039;ll have to wait till tomorrow for me to review the contents since I&#039;ll have to meet my drop to get the package first (And it&#039;s Easter)...<br /><br />Despite that theXchange gets attacked like they state on their vendorpage I only can say that they are definitely legit if they work a bit on their stealth (or have worked on it meanwhile - I can&#039;t tell about the stealth of the second yet as I already said.)

				Update 2: <br /><br /><br />Tried this over the bank holiday weekend.<br />Stepped on it a little bit, and spanked the whole gram over 48hrs.<br /><br />Very nice indeed.<br /><br />I&#039;m no cola expert, but I know the difference between garbage and good product.<br />This was good product.<br />Very nice buzz, and very moreish. lol<br /><br />I never snort anything, fucking nasty. <br />I just rizla bomb on an empty stomach.<br />Teeth grinding was an issue, I&#039;ll be honest, but I have no idea what this is an indication of. <br />I felt nice waves of euphoria, a speedy buzz and heightened sense of alertness. Playing guitar was incredible, I was a genius. lol.&nbsp; ..although it probably sounded garbage.<br />I also cleaned my house in record time. <br /><br />I sometimes fee nauseated after cola, but not on this occasion, and after the weekend was over, 100mg of diphenhydramine was enough to get to sleep. Not much of a coke hangover either, which was nice. <br /><br />If I need coke in the future I&#039;ll definitely give Xchange a looksee.

				Received my letter to the USA from theXchange in 9 day which is pretty good considering. The stealth was a bit dodgy but i messaged Thexchange with my concerns and he took them to heart, more then making up for it in customer service. In terms of the product itself, awesome.Weighed out on point.&nbsp; Definitely better the normal cocaine that goes through the streets around here. Not fully 84% + purity but definitely quality. A little clumpy and almost pure white. Slight bitter coke taste with some real kick. Makes my whole system numb after 2 or three lines. Overall id really recommended theXchange nice generous guy with quality product and quick shipping.
