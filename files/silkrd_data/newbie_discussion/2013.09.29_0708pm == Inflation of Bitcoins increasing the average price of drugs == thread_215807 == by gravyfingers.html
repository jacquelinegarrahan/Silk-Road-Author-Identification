				Hello fellow newbies, and the SR community<br /><br />It seems to me the recent increase in the bitcoin market price has obviously increased the average price on SR.<br />Although it&#039;s the vendor who controls the their products prices, iv noticed that not many have changed there prices to accommodate the influx of bitcoin prices.<br />I know i shouldn&#039;t be complaining because i don&#039;t think id be anywhere without the site.<br /><br />Any personal opinions? Has anyone also noticed this?<br /><br />Gravy

				I wouldn&#039;t say BTC prices are inflated at the moment, they have been much higher and of course much lower. As for them affecting the price on here I would have to disagree. Prices overall remains pretty constant, except when availability in certain markets become more scarce or common. Unless BTC goes way up, or way down I&#039;ve never feared buying them as say a $1000 worth of btc is still a $1000 no matter what. The real risk I would argue is for the vendors as the good one&#039;s honor placed orders even if BTC drops to .50 cents. So really the only think your probably noticing is a fluctuating market value based on supply versus the value of BTC. Vendors weigh in on this one with me.

				I&#039;ve noticed this as well over the past couple of weeks BTC has risen slightly.&nbsp; I wonder as well if it went the other way if prices would change more quickly.&nbsp; Now if you had coins from the early days lol , it would be a huge score.

				I&#039;d imagine it would work the opposite way and prices drop after BTC value increases since vendors make a little extra &quot;interest&quot; on the bitcoins they have lying around.
