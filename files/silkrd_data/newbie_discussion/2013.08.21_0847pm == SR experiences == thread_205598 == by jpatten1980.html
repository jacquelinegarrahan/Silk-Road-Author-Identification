				After about two weeks reading the forums/building up courage I finally took the plunge and ordered a couple of tabs of 25b from J1m1th1ng on a Sunday.&nbsp;<br /><br />I PM&#039;d J1m1th1ng the next night, introducing myself and clarifying my shipping option. He was really cool and said since I was a first timer he&#039;d throw in some extras and that he&#039;d make up my order then. I assumed that meant he&#039;d ship it next day and, per his shipping policy (and against everything I had read) I FE&#039;d.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two weeks later I PM&#039;d J1m1th1ng back, inquiring if he had sent the package. I waited a little less than a week with no response and PM&#039;d him again. Now, about a month later and no word, no product.&nbsp;<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is, if there&#039;s so many buyers claiming that a package was never received that he had to enforce an FE policy, then why not figure out a different shipping technique? Why not respond to a simple question of whether a product got shipped or not? If he said it got shipped I would&#039;ve left it at that, probably ordering from him again. But as it stands his is the only product I&#039;ve FE&#039;d on, the only product that hasn&#039;t arrived, and the only vendor that&#039;s ignored my messages. I have no doubt he&#039;s legit- his stats prove it, it&#039;s just I would stick to guidline of not FEing. EVER.<br />

				On a Friday I ordered 10g from MUSHBUD. I PM&#039;d him to introduce myself. Then, the next day realized I didn&#039;t include MY COUNTRY!!! PM&#039;d and he had already fixed my mistake. Really careful vendor.<br /><br />A week later the package came. Extremely professional job. My first success and it assuaged any doubts I might have had before.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried the product but I&#039;ll write up a TR when I do.<br /><br />With absolute confidence I would order from MUSHBUD again (and again and again).

				Yeah I got burned by chaletla by essentially FEing.&nbsp; In short I did one successful transaction, good product, etc. Then they went stealth (ie hide themselves on SR) but messaged about one last order and said for me to send him the money (ie going to account page and send money to user). I did that thinking he was good so far. He&#039;s never even read my message that has my address. And since I sent it directly there&#039;s no recourse.&nbsp; I&#039;d only consider FE on a vendor I&#039;ve delt with multiple times and have no reason to expect anything to go awry (the going stealth should have been my alert).&nbsp; So now I&#039;ll never FE.&nbsp; Essentially because I as a buyer got burned I&#039;ll never FE where sellers that get burned require FE.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather move and even pay a little extra if that means not FE.<br /><br />I just posted a review on three vendors that even though as far as they could tell the account I was using was new (I&#039;ve recreated accounts a few times) with only being created less than a month ago and 0 transactions (transactions don&#039;t show up in your stats until they&#039;re finalized) none required FE.<br /><br />Just remember to be courteous and if you do receive it and satisfied be sure to finalize so they get the money they deserve.&nbsp; An unfortunate side effect is why a lot of reviews you see for a product basically comments on the stealth of package and initial impression on product as finalizing as early as possible makes the seller happy.&nbsp; Also remember you can edit comments later (click on account &gt; view feedback) I don&#039;t know if you can always edit them or if it&#039;s only for a certain period of time.&nbsp; Basically if it got to the point where you received it and what you got looks like the real deal then go ahead and finalize.&nbsp; Minor things like quality can sometimes just be handled through pm with a good merchant (remember to use pgp!) or just keep it in mind next time you&#039;re in need of something.<br /><br />BTW even though I&#039;ve posted this on a couple topics now here&#039;s that review I did: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.msg1478129#msg1478129

				On a Tuesday I placed two orders: one for DOM from Litescape and the other for 25c from IndigoChild. I PM&#039;d them both to introduce myself. Indigo and I chatted back and forth a little which was cool.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day I got a PM from Liescape letting me know the DOM was shipping (damn fast)! Indigo was a few days in shipping the 25c but also wrote letting me know about the delay and when it would ship.<br /><br />The DOM came on Saturday the same week. The package was simple, inconspicuous.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 25c came the following Monday, also simple and unassuming. IndigoChild gave me an extra tab of a stronger strength of 25c.<br /><br />So, on the bus ride to work I popped a 1/4 of the smaller 25c to get a feel of the substance. Very light waving (no trails), a psychedelic mind but completely in control (which was a good thing since I&#039;m a surgeon... jk). I did have an impromptu meeting learning a new process which I was able to participate in and keep relaxed. I later redosed another 1/4. More of the same intensity, just longer duration of about 8hrs total. I could tell a hit of 1.1mg would be beautiful, fun and informative. I&#039;ll write up a TR for higher doses (esp. that giant hit of 2mg).<br /><br />I haven&#039;t taken the DOM but will soon. I&#039;ll post a TR on that also.

				On a Friday I ordered some Allylescaline from chroot. I PM&#039;d him to introduce myself. He wrote back the next day telling me the package had shipped.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the following Monday (Holy Fast-as-fucking Lightning, Batman!) I received the package. The product was capsules and the packaging took that into account, not crushing a single one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of which, chroot sent along an extra cap which was kind. I&#039;ll post a TR when I blast off.

				Okay, so here&#039;s the lessons I&#039;ve learned:<br /><br />-Don&#039;t FE unless you&#039;re willing to gamble that money.<br /><br />-Write your country when purchasing internationally.<br /><br />-Figure out GPG. I learned how to use Kleopatra (part of the GP4Win download) from a wiki... I think I googled &quot;gp4win wiki tutorial&quot;. It was pretty straight forward.<br /><br />-Though the SR wiki says to use a fake name and a different address than the one the drugs will be kept in, I used my own name and my own address. If I get caught, shame on me but there&#039;s still a shit ton of mail sent around the world everyday and I&#039;m ordering small quantities for myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let the Road connect us all!<br />

				Never FE not sure why anyone does.&nbsp; I&#039;m new haven&#039;t had any issue finding good vendors who don&#039;t require it even for a newbie.&nbsp; Then once your stuff gets to you, don&#039;t be an asshole- finalize right away.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite simple!

				I know, I know, everyone says not to but I did FE once though I generally avoid doing so like the plague.&nbsp; Yes, it was to an H vendor and I was quite nervous about it.&nbsp; But hordes and multitudes FE&#039;d to this person and he appears very trustworthy (key is appears!!!).&nbsp; But I made the smallest transaction possible, like $40 total and it all worked out, I even got about 30 extra milligrams.&nbsp; This vendor is subsrgood, he is the man, and I love what he vends, a taste of heaven.

				Yeah, I hadn&#039;t been buying H on here so I&#039;m sure it does depend pretty heavily on the product.&nbsp; In that case I would imagine the best thing to do would be do a lot of research on the vendors and start with a small order if you really have to FE.&nbsp;

				So it&#039;s been awhile since I started this thread and mentioned I&#039;d write up TRs... Feeling a bit lazy literally (pup very much intended) so suffice it to say:<br /><br />1. chroot&#039;s Allylescaline- FUN! Took three caps spanned 4hrs apart. Lasted ~14hrs. Minimal visuals but nice mellow body high, no load whatsoever. No &quot;amped-up&quot; feeling. Just chill. Perfect for social settings. I&#039;ve got three caps left- gonna take all three at once next time. I recommend trying it.<br /><br />2. litescape&#039;s DOM- FUN! One tab (5mg) lasted ~12hrs. Colors were crisp, bright, pronounced. Kept noticing little yellow flowers in all the gray of the day (I was walking out in a storm). Hard to talk to people, was rude a couple times just because I couldn&#039;t handle them. Again, I recommend trying it.<br /><br />3. indigochild&#039;s 25c- FAVORITE! Wow! I did a half tab a couple times at work split 4hrs apart which I handled easily, but one tab at once? Wow! There&#039;s aura&#039;s of green and pink. The warping/breathing is omnipresent. I was happily confused in the kitchen trying to cook (I cook all the meals in my house, very experienced). I played FEZ (get the game if only to play it while you&#039;re tripping) AHHHH!!! I love this chemical. If I found out it shrunk your balls and replaced them with old rotten lemons, well let&#039;s just say I&#039;d be making lemonade. GET THIS SHIT NOW, AND GET IT FROM INDIGO!<br /><br />4.mushbud&#039;s Mushrooms- FUN! I spent the night tripping with my sis-in-law... the first trip with a partner in over 10yrs. She was working through some issues so I listened and listened and listened. The visuals were awesome: I actually injured my ankle by rolling it so much as I looked up at the starry sky and lost my balance over and over. We got lost on a dark beach trying to find the rest of our party but I was totally relaxed with the experience. I recommend this vendor for the nice discount and safe delivery (you&#039;ll know what I mean when you order from him).<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s that. Lot&#039;s of trips in a little time. I feel like I&#039;m in high school again! <br /><br />Long live our freedom on this shaded road.

				I lost 13k to &quot;googleeyed&quot;, when his product was seized and he didnt re-ship like he said he would, or at least refund a percentage of the purchase price.&nbsp; That was my first experience buying on SR.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend him at all -- his feedback has gone down dramatically since then.&nbsp; When I ordered from him his feedback was pretty much as high as you could have on SR.&nbsp; After the seizure, he refused to answer communication and was very dodgy.&nbsp; Nothing worse than a vendor who doesn&#039;t keep his word, or advertises falsely.
