				I was reading reddit/Silkroad and saw that some people are having trouble with Coinbase&#039;s new instant verification. It told them there was enough information about them or something like that. I just wanted to let everybody know that it worked for me and I am very happy about this! No more waiting a week for BTC! Go Coinbase!

				Every time I have used Coinbase it took four days for the coins to appear in my wallet. I finally stopped using them when they required a cell phone number for verification (I don&#039;t carry one).

				Im gonna go ahead and say that the instant verification on Coinbase is the best thing out there.&nbsp; It is INSTANT, and I even got my coin under market value due to the dumb luck of my timing.&nbsp; I used to hate that 5 day hold, and stopped using them, like most probably did.&nbsp; I think they got the hint though and decided to be the bomb-dig! No more bullshit running to CVS, or getting a moneypak, or waiting on some ass to charge me 10-20%.&nbsp; Coinbase y&#039;all.&nbsp; And if you don&#039;t know, now you know....<br /><br />But, yeah, carry a cell phone. I haven&#039;t checked the calendar recently (that is on my cell phone), but I think the current date would reflect the absurdity of not carrying one as of.... 12 years ago.

				+1 for the new Coinbase instant buy. The major thing is that you have to have made a purchase on Coinbase 30 days prior to making an instant transaction. It&#039;s definitely worth it though. If you&#039;ve never used it before, just buy a dollar or two on your Coinbase account and let it sit there for 30 days until you can upgrade your account.

				Im looking on the site and I&#039;m not seeing an instant option. I put in an order for 1 coin yesterday in case maybe it only comes up when you&#039;ve made a recent purchase. Is this new option really currently available for coin base? Am I just missing it, because bitinstant is down right now and it&#039;s really fuckin with me :/<br />~DFG~

				I&#039;ve been using coinbase exclusively all the way along because other options weren&#039;t working for me. Dwolla to camp BX failed every time and while mailing a MO to camp BX probably would have taken as long as coinbase, I stuck with coinbase for ease of use. Ebay when needed a few cents to make up a purchase.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had the chance yet due to funds to use instant, but the verification worked fine for me.<br /><br />The only thing that pissed me off with coinbase was their transfers. If I bought on thurs by midday, I would receive the following thursday, but if I bought thursday night -Saturday, it wasn&#039;t available till Friday, fine, but several times they ganked my money early, once on Tuesday, while still making me wait till Friday to get my coins. <br /><br />All in all though this option will set coinbase into one of the premier sites I think.

				I ordered 1.2 from them last friday and was told that my coin would be there by 3:30 on thursday.<br /><br />Thursday came and found that my order had been cancelled. I was told that it determined to be a &quot;high risk&quot; transaction. So, not only did I wait for a week for nothing, my 30 day wait until getting to &quot;level 2&quot; and not having to wait 4 days for coin went back to zero.<br /><br />I flipped absolute shit and sent them a very nasty email whining like a little bitch.<br /><br /><br />They got back to me the next day and told me that they were sorry and that they had &quot;whitelisted&quot; me and that I would never have that &quot;high risk&quot; problem again. They also said that they pushed through my previous order at the same rate that the bitcoin had been worth a week before (at the time of purchase, it was 117USD for 1 coin). Sure enough, I checked my account and it was there!!!<br /><br />Needless to say, I sent them back an email detailing how I&#039;m sorry I acted like a bitch.<br /><br /><br />I probably won&#039;t buy any more coin from them until the 3day wait is over, probably use bitQuick until then, but I&#039;ll be back to them for sure...mainly because their rate is a helluva a lot cheaper than bitQuick.<br /><br />Coinbase is aight with me.

				Personally, I would expect that generally if someone is investing in Bitcoin they&#039;d be likely to buy a large lump sum, or possibly small amounts during dips in price.&nbsp; I doubt that&#039;s what people who use Coinbase to fund Silk Road purchases do, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s quite easy to pick out the people who consistently buy whether the price is at a dip or not, transfer coins out of their Coinbase wallet, and only come back when they (for some reason) need to buy more.&nbsp; Repeatedly.<br /><br />It goes without saying that Coinbase is an American company and has all your information.&nbsp; I would not use their service if you are buying more than the occasional drug enhanced weekend or something.&nbsp; Of course I&#039;m not saying this would serve as damning proof in a court of law, but the idea is to not end up suspicious enough to ever get to court in the first place.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my opinion, but I thought it worth pointing out.

				If you complete all the coinbase verification steps, then the waiting period ceases to exist (and you get your coins instantly) starting 30 days after your first BTC purchase.&nbsp; I love it now, works great for me--although, having said that, they do collect a good deal of information and if that&#039;s a concern, SelfSovereignty raises some very valid points.&nbsp; Be careful about how you use it--try to defy the pattern.

				I used LBC through an online vendor and had the BTC within 15 minutes of letting them know the cash was deposited.&nbsp; Then again after the 30 day wait, Coinbase is instant.&nbsp; I also had a Coinbase transaction canceled for being high-risk, but was white-listed within a few hours of emailing them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never sent a payment directly to a SR address and I&#039;ve read that it happens to legit BTC traders all the time, so be prepared to ask to be white-listed if you use Coinbase.&nbsp; No complaints other than that.

				I have used coinbase for several months.&nbsp; The only update I have is that they changed policy on instant btc availability for level 2 accounts. while you can still buy/ sell 50 per week, only 10 per week can be bought instantly.&nbsp; There is 4 day waiting period for additional buys made during same week.&nbsp;
