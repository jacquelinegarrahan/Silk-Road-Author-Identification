				I sent product to a customer and it has me worried. After the order came in I sent the same day to a PO box address 3 states away. I immediately sent a message to the buyer to thank and let him know it was sent. The buyer replied 2 days later to a question I had asked in that message but since then nothing. Now it has been over a week and still no finalize on order but no messages still. so I decide to track the DCN to see if the package was delivered and I get this:<br />(dates changed and xxxx state info)<br />Activity<br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 19, 2013, xxxxx pm, JERSEY CITY, NJ zipcode <br />Depart USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 16, 2013, buyer town, xx zipcode <br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 26, 2013, xxxxx pm, buyer town, xx zipcode <br />Arrive USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 16, 2013, xxxx am, my town, xx zipcode <br />Depart USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 16, 2013, xxxx am, my town, xx zipcode <br />Depart USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 15, 2013, xxxxx pm, my town, xx zipcode <br />Processed through USPS Sort Facility, xxxxx 15, 2013, xxxx pm, my town, xx zipcode <br /><br />The odd thing with the DCN tracking info is the fact the package was in a sort facility in his state and now is in NJ. NJ is about 6 states away from where it should be delivered. WTF is going on?

				Priority with DCN always works great but there was one time I experienced the same shit but it finally got to it&#039;s destination and it took about a week longer then it should have. Basically one of the postal workers was fucked up and sent that shit to the wrong detination or maybe the address was incorrectly given to you

				Well, I&#039;m not a seller, but the thing that strikes me strangest about this scenario is that your customer has not sent any messages asking where their package is. I know I would have.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of as far as the USPS&#039; behavior is that the buyer somehow had his mail forwarded?<br /><br />Also, things do get misrouted. It does happen and when you consider how many pieces of mail they handle, it&#039;s surprising it doesn&#039;t happen more often than it does.<br /><br />BTW, there is a sorting center in a big city not too far from the one city you identified that has had its share of problems with delays and screw ups. <br /><br />Have you sent other packages successfully since then? (Don&#039;t answer that, seriously. I&#039;m just trying to suggest ways of thinking about what is going on.)

				Don&#039;t worry about it USPS is so disorganized anyways. Have you seen the inside of a post office. I just wonder how we get our mails.

				I&#039;ve had a priority order stuck for 2 days now at &quot;Depart USPS Sort Facility January 30, 2013&quot; That was updated at 1 AM so it&#039;s been 2 days and it&#039;s still stuck there. I have a few things I bought off Amazon and Ebay and they are all stuck there too for the same amount of time now. I&#039;m thinking it got seized and they stopped all mail to check it or something sigh. I&#039;ve never had this happen before in 10 years of buying online. <br />
