				I know this has to be a question thats asked a million times and I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m hoping someone will be willing to take me under their wing for a little bit, it would really help me out.&nbsp; It&#039;s very important to me that I quickly learn how to do all this the right safe way.&nbsp; I will take the time to teach other new members once I learn, so it&#039;s a safer place for everyone.&nbsp; Being safe is extremely important to be and I&#039;m very afraid of screwing something up!

				Sorry for the neg, but ive had enough of the same simple questions being asked over and over again by all the newbs.. theres literally dozens of tutorials and guides for your question, here and on google. <br /><br />Dont feel bad tho, from this point out any one making there own span to 50, asking about how to get btc, or basic pgp inquiries..anything that can be simply found out with the search engine or by reading stickys, theyre all getting neggd. Best of luck dude, ill +1 you when you figure out how to get your coin

				Build some kind of android that is indistinguishable from a human being, give it a life, a fake identity etc then get it to buy BTC for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you living in the usa or where? Depending on where you live you have different btc buying options.

				Bitinstant is a good site, you can pay through western union and have the coins deposited directly into a bitcoin address on a site like flexcoin.&nbsp; Then transfer to SR.&nbsp; some people bounce the coins around a bnunch of places too.&nbsp; But honestly you should just read up as much as possible.&nbsp; Try to familiarize yourself in depth with how it works and you&#039;ll be much better off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here 3 months or so now and it gets really easy, just work at it a little.
