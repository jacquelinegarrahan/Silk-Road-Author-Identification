				I placed an order from a well-known vendors sub account that ships worldwide vs. just the E.U.<br />When i initially placed the two orders, he had me FE 1. Then sent me a message asking how to ship worldwide and what were the best methods ?? ( His main account is well-known, theirs no reason he should ask me this )<br /><br />What do I do.<br />I&#039;ve been waiting for his response, seeing that he is online every single day yet ignoring my messages completely. I just want to know if they have been shipped. I placed it almost a week ago.

				If you can, I would hit the cancel button. Unless it is something stated in vendor profile,or an arrangement you have made, not having ship by the time you can hit cancel is not a great vendor.

				I can&#039;t because he marked both as IT so I could FE one of them. Or at least I presume. I also see that he has been reading my messages just not responded.<br />Main acct dutch quality, anyone had exp with him ?

				There is nothing you, or SR support, can do since you finalized. Just wait it out and hope it shows up.<br /><br />This is why it is recommended to never FE.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Once you finalize, there is no way back. You&#039;re at the mercy of the vendor. This is why 1) build up your <br />account reputation by buying small amounts of drugs (most vendors won&#039;t require FE then) and 2) if you can, avoid FE. I don&#039;t like vendors who require it even if you have plenty of successful ttransactions
