				A few weeks back I made my first order via Silk Road, 0.2 grams of heroin. I got it fast and it was of good quality.<br /><br />With that experience under my belt, I ordered 14 grams of weed from a seller with good feedback. Soon after I ordered, the seller started getting poorer feedback, with long delays in delivey being reported and a few people not getting their orders. However, because most buyers did get their orders in the end, I decided not to sweat it and ordered a few more things in the meantime: another 3 grams of weed and some seeds from a different seller, and 3.5 grams of shrooms from another.<br /><br />Around this time, I got one page of a bank statement in the mail along with a letter saying the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The enclosed mail item was returned to Australia Post. It appears that it may have been stolen from your letterbox after delivery. Our Corporate Security Group [and the police] are aware of this incident and investigations are continuing. It seems that an external party has opened the item and, therefore, the contents may be damaged or missing.<br /><br />Due to an increased incidence of mail theft after delivery within your local area, you are encouraged to consider the security and location of your letterbox.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My letterbox is more secure than many, and locks. A few days later I got a letter from a neighbour saying a FedEx parcel had gone missing and to contact him if I had any further information.<br /><br />In the days since, none of my orders have arrived despite being a couple of weeks since I ordered, although I have been receiving other mail here and there. I have no idea what to make of all this, whether I have been the victim of further theft or if my mail has been intercepted. I&#039;ve never had any problems with not getting my mail in the past, so I&#039;m having really bad luck as of late. Needless to say, I&#039;m not likely to be placing any more orders on Silk Road for a while.

				The first thing to do is act (and react) like a totally innocent person.<br /><br />This likely has NOTHING to do with SR or your orders, and there is a thief actually operating. (Which means they got your drugs, and they are not likely to admit to stealing drugs even if they are caught, would you admit to it? :) So you are quite within your rights to follow up and protest to AusPost etc.<br /><br />Remeber this: ANYONE CAN SEND ANYBODY ANYTHING IN THE MAIL, receiving or accepting any item is NEVER grounds for incrimination, anywhere, except maybe some fucked up place like Singapore.<br /><br />Read the forum for how to behave if you think you have been subject of a controlled delivery.<br /><br />Trust me, you newbies have hyper-active imaginations, no one in the PO or LE gives a fuck about your mail, unless you&#039;re ordering by the truckload, in which case, it will be arriving in a submarine, not a package.<br /><br />Please all of you guys, go read the forum well, before we dish out anymore -ve feedback today. Sheesh! Do we have to spoonfeed you fuckers every step of the way? It is all there, go READ. :(

				Never meant to imply this was Silk Road&#039;s fault. I&#039;d be silly to keep placing orders that don&#039;t get to me, is all. I do intend to follow it up with Australia Post.<br /><br />In what part of my post do I have a hyperactive imagination? I haven&#039;t jumped to any conclusions one way or the other. The weird thing is, my mail box locks and I generally don&#039;t see any signs of it being pried open or tampered with. I remember finding it open once, perhaps shortly before I got that letter from Australia Post, and presumed I forgot to lock it. Other than that, nothing.

				Yeah, sounds like you have a band of junkies/thieves following around your local parcel carriers.<br /><br />I remember not too long ago reading about a few guys here in the US getting caught doing the same thing.&nbsp; They&#039;d just follow around the UPS/FedEx guys, watch them deliver, then run up and steal the package after the deliverer was gone.&nbsp; Guess those guys stole a lot, and pretty much stuck to the same area.&nbsp; The lock on your mailbox could most likely be easily defeated... either with some sort of master key, or some other finagling/rigging/picking.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to figure out who these junkies stealing your stuff are, just mail yourself a big box and be there waiting hidden... or set up a surveillance camera etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

That&#039;s when you may have got done. Are you also saying more mail has since gone missing? Could be this time they are locking the lock after they&#039;re done fossicking in there. <br />Aussie suburban streets are pretty deserted during the day, you could walk nude down them and not get noticed.<br />If you&#039;re lock is some cheap Chinese thing you got at woollies, then upgrade your lock. Was either picked, or the thief had a dupe key.<br />You are in Australia, shit takes time to get to us from everywhere. plus you have a thief problem. They&#039;re both not really something you&#039;re going to get advice on that will be any different than if you posted on a gardening site, for example.<br />Good luck with it all. See you on the &#039;senior&#039; threads sometime.<br />
