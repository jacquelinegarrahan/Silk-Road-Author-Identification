				Last week, I tried to order 100mg of #4 Heroin from vendor &quot;subsrgood&quot;. Unfortunately, he had a policy of not selling to buyers with less than 5 transactions at the time. I offered up my information (including my parents&#039; cell numbers... as I live with them, and would be kicked out if my purchases from the SR were discovered) in an attempt to convince him to sell to me. The vendor misunderstood me, and thought I was a minor who already had a Heroin habit from buying Black Tar Heroin from the local &quot;Mexicans&quot; in my area. I am Rx&#039;ed Oxymorphone IR, which I inject, and so I have high standards for dope. &quot;subsrgood&quot; told me he would sell me only 100mgs (I had been thinking about getting his listing for a 1/4 gram of the stuff), and that it was not good I had a Heroin habit at my age. He was trying to convince me that I needed to but down the IV opiates as a habit as a teenager would derail my life. I am 27 years old.... but, the ethics and care &quot;subsrgood&quot; showed with his words/actions are incredible. He knew I would be buying BTH regardless of him supplying me with #4 H, and so in an attempt to help me quit (what my purchases are about right now... putting the needle down after 5 years of daily IV use... he knew this), he bent his rules. Despite me not paying for tracking, when I asked when the package shipped, he supplied me with the information it was scheduled to arrive that afternoon (yesterday). I got 160mg (weight confirmed by my scales) despite only paying for 100mg. And, &quot;subsrgood&quot; warned me that the stuff was fire... It is, 25mg gets me high. So, buy from &quot;subsrgood&quot; with confidence... a stand-up vendor!<br /><br />I am doing a &quot;Fireball&quot; (H, Coke, OxyM, and Ritalin all in one needle) once my Coke comes in... the whole point of my orders have been doing this shot... the best shot I have ever done. I will be posting a &quot;trip-report&quot; and updating my feedback once I do this shot.<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				&quot;Fireball&quot; was a botched attempt. I got to K-pin&#039;ed and Soma&#039;ed out impatiently waiting for my Coke. Ordering more stuff from &quot;subsrgood&quot; today. His stuff was incredible... Absolutely the best. My Oxymorphone script has made buying dope a waste of money. The #4 is so good, I could see myself getting junked out again. Haha.<br /><br />Buy, BUY, BUYYYY!

				&quot;Fireball&quot; sounds like a death shot! Haha. Subs is an awesome vendor, but u will notice that he doesn&#039;t have listings up right now. I have bought from him b4 and am even a VIP member with him. He is one of the best vendors I&#039;ve ever got h from, but there are other good ones too look at while he is away. He himself recommends GotsItAll. I recently spent a few hundred $ to try out the best stuff I could find. One of those was GIA. This review may help u make a decision on finding someone to get h from when subs is gone. Enjoy<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=192761.0
