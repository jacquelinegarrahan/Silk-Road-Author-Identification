				I&#039;m considering opening a vendor account to sell cheap Jamaican outdoor and British Columbia hydro, aka BC Bud, aka Beasters. I will only ship USA Domestic for now. The BC Bud is the best fresh light green, orange hair hydro you have ever seen. It&#039;s grown in British Columbia and smuggled into the states over the border by runners. The Jamaican outdoor is the best fresh light green seedless outdoor you have ever seen. It&#039;s grown in tropical climates and shipped into the states in trap floor drums. I never handle the seedy, or stem filled Mexican outdoor when I can not source the much better Jamaican stuff. <br /><br />There&#039;s a few West Coast vendors that have the top shelf game on lock and I can not compete with their prices on SR. What I do not see though, is any USA vendor selling the good Jamaican outdoor, or any USA vendor selling BC Bud. I can get pounds of both and I have educated myself on the process of shipping through reading these forums and ordering bud myself. I&#039;m ready to go, I just need to know that there is a demand for this cheaper bud before I get invested in a vendor account. I&#039;ll list an estimated price breakdown below. Respond if you would be interested.<br /><br />Jamaican Outdoor:<br /><br />3.5 - $25<br />7 - $45<br />14 - $75<br />28 - $150<br />QP - $525<br />HP - $925<br />LB - $1600<br /><br />British Columbia Hydro:<br /><br />3.5 - $35<br />7 - $65<br />14 - $125<br />28 - $210<br />QP - $780<br />HP - $1430<br />LB - $2750<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fv.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fw.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/f8.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fb.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/f7.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/f4.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fa.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fh.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/f3.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/f0.png<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/fg.png

These numbers are below SR medical grade numbers though. I will get my supplier to come down on price over time. He is a relatively new connect and he is new to this aspect of the game.

				I agree with the latest poster. the price for the bud is expensive, but if I can get a half shipped to the east coast for 120, I&#039;m in. right now there really isn&#039;t anything like that on the SR that I know of

That must take forever. The outdoor I get is always really good for outdoor. I won&#039;t buy it if it has a ton of seeds, if it&#039;s dark, if it&#039;s full of stems and leaves, if it smells like hay, etc. I never buy that Mexican shit. I will get pics of both of them up in this thread and in the thread that I post in the Product Offer section. The BC Bud is the most beautiful and best quality hydro you can get anywhere.

I&#039;m assuming the quality of that stuff is no where near as good as the stuff that I get. Every once and a while, the 3 guys I work with are not able to come up with anything that is good enough and I will just pass for the time being. The stuff always borders on good though, so even the lower quality stuff is probably better than the stuff that is currently available. The quality of this stuff varries, but I don&#039;t like handling anything with a lot of stems, a lot of seeds, a bad smell, or anything too compressed. I agree, I don&#039;t know why people even bother with that brown, compressed, seed and stem riddled shit.

I wouldn&#039;t compare the the BC Bud with the Jamaican outdoor though. They are completely different growing processes, smell completely different, taste completely different, and have different buzzes. The BC Bud is grown indoor hydroponically and the Jamaican is grown outdoor in soil. My prices are not firm yet and will come down.

My packaging will be overkill. I already have a food grade vac sealer and I will be using heat sealed MBB or Mylar exterior bags for extra security depending on what is available. I&#039;m informed about all of details and I have received packages from a bunch of different vendors.

				The rest of the necessary supplies are on the way. I have my vac sealer now and I will be messing with that soon to get a feel for it and how it compresses the bud. I already have two ideas for preventing bud compression. Once I have the rest of the supplies, I will experiment a bit with them to figure out my shipping methods and then open a vendor account. Should be about 3 weeks. I will post a link in this thread to my vendor account once I have it.
