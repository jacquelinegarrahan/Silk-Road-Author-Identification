				Hello All.<br /><br />Firstly let me apologise for starting a new thread. I did a search and discovered other threads on this topic, but there was no option for me to reply or ask my question. Perhaps they are locked?<br /><br />In any event. I am not sure I am allowed to post the name or URL of the website. But I found a few local vendors, one gave his phone number, but it doesn&#039;t work, a few months old mind.<br /><br />Is this a good way for a &#039;Newbie&#039; to trade?<br /><br />P.S. at the side of his/her name is said 20/2000 Does that mean the minimum he will sell is 20. That is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of 4 - maybe spending just over 100GP pounds.<br /><br />Many thanks. S&amp;S

				If you&#039;re dealing in £ I&#039;m pretty sure I know the website you&#039;re talking about.<br />I&#039;ve used it, did a direct bank transfer, leaves a trail but bitcoins are getting more widespread and are a good investment that it doesn&#039;t concern me.<br />Different users accept different payment, so have a look, I think meeting in person is a little unnecessary although the exchanges of codes make sure you&#039;re not gonna get ripped off.<br />Users feedback and total transactions are displayed next to their name, the 20/2000 you see is the min/max value in £ they can do.<br />I have to say it&#039;s the quickest, easiest and cheapest way I&#039;ve managed to buy any, some of the sellers have over 800 successful transactions and 100% feedback.<br />I hope I could be of help, I only came to this section to spam!

				For my first couple of bitcoins I just used bitinstant and I could get it sent right to here but now they took that option out so I use Blue Skye Traders who are awesome and the fee isnt bad at all

				go for the Localbitcoins! You will be surprised to find sellers that accept paypal, and using escrow its 100% safe, and the BTC arrive in your wallet in seconds. as for the 20-2000 , it probably is for the amount of Currency, not BTC. you can buy any amount of money you want, not only 1, or 2 BTC&nbsp; but even 1,362BTC<br /><br />Hope i helped

				Another good place to get Bitcoins, provided you live in the US is Coinbase. You can get up to 10BTC a day after registering, but its done by bank transfer. After meeting a few requirements you can buy 100BTC a day. Or you can sell them.
