				So i think i want to be talked into not out of but im hardcore h user whos now on methadone, havnt done h in couple years. Came to road in search of bud and have been overwhelmed with the scene here. Every time i make a purchase (only weed so far) i tell myself maybe nexttime ill get a little h again just get my feet wet. Taste what is sure to be some of the best h ive ever done. Im now on a much smaller dose of methadone 30mgs than before 120mgs, so im pretty sure some good stuff will cut right thru that methadone. that said i know myself and if i do some dope ill start shooting right away and spin tollerance levels and stability in life thru the roof and out the window. So how do h users maintain there habits only using the road? I feel like ill be right back to the streets to cop for reasons of finance accessibility and patience alike. Then will eventually start getting arrested all the time, be dope sick what will feel like everyother day, and become all a around miserable. maybe somebody with similiar shoes to fill can give me their two cents on how to operate via the road and not in the streets. thanx

				You can&#039;t turn a pickle back into a cucumber. If you have experience as a heavy H user then you already know how it will end up if you order even a small amount. It&#039;s just that kind of drug. <br /><br />On the other hand there is a lot of other great stuff on SR that will get you good and high, without fucking up your life anywhere near as much as Mr H. For example, I think the cannabis concentrates, and the edibles are very good. Edibles give me a solid body high. Edibles combined with Adderal is a great buzz for me personally. <br /><br />Good luck to you and stay safe. <br /><br />MG

				Dont do it man. In fact the Methadone is already too much. You know what the ugly side is like. From personal experience [ex coke, china, meth dealer] none of it was worth it the next day, hell once the come down hit really. All it does is burn a whole straight into your pockets that could have went to your kids, gf, wife, or even yourself. Since then my drug of choice is now Cannabis, no damage, yet eurphoric. I also like to dip into psychs and halluc. DMT, Shrooms, LSD, open your mind and embrace the warmth.
