				Hallo lovely silkroad - team, forum member, and all the others,<br /><br />I am from the EU, Germany and searching for real good quality weed for a few buggs less then here.<br />I am self be an grower, but at the&nbsp; time i havenÂ´t the option to grow, i have no room for this..<br />The quality on the streetmarket are middle or crap.<br />Some few secret seller have some realy good weed strains, but they are realy expensive.<br />And kush strains are very rare here. So when i search on silkroad for weed, i have the wow effect.<br />I am a big haze an kush fan, and some i think great vendors have some great strains/quality for very good prices!<br />So i am working on to buy here in a few days, weeks, months.<br /><br />I read a lot of shipping threats, search a lot for germany here in the forum and i think i could be save to ship from oversea to EU, germany.<br /><br />But what you think about? Some member here which have expirience and can give me something from his knowledge?<br /><br />The other question is, i am not a friend off giving away my real name,adress .<br />So, in some threats some member were reading about a packstation, it s an service from the DHL. I have the chance to get an faked and anonymous packstationgoldcard.<br />I got a name, postnumber. I can leave a package in every packstation in germany.<br /><br />Adress would look like:<br /><br />Max Musterman<br />Postnumber xxx<br />Packstation xxx ( there are many packstations in germany, for every city code.)<br />XXX City<br /><br />Vendors would send to such a packstation?<br /><br /><br />Sorry for my bad englisch!<br /><br />Greetz

				foebud e.v. is selling legal fake id cards but i doubt that you can register a packing station with these.. it should be easier with a fake id from another country. im sure i can organize that.
