				i bought coins thru localbitcoins .com met the guy and he sent my coins then an hour later i went home and i sent the coins to my silk road address its been about an hour and i still havent gotten my coins yet i find it hard to believe the address for my SL wallet could be traced back to Sl and localbitcoin knew it was for that and either kept my coin or what not all i know is my coin isnt in SL and is no longer in my localbitcoin wallet and the transaction was sent successfully&nbsp; so idk any help would be great on this matter

				BTC transfers to SR address can take up to 5 hours. For me it usually takes about 2-3. Nothing to worry about just give it some time and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll show up. ;D
