				I&#039;ve been buying from MrCronk for a while, and in general he has been fine, quick dispatch, good packaging, average to poor communication. Ordered 14gs of his thai schwag on tuesday, nothing here, a week later. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s a scammer, because he has good fb and I&#039;ve been happy with him before, but... damn, I hate waiting for buds.

				I think something must of happened sometime last week because looking at the feedback alot who ordered something last tuesday or wednesday were waiting more than 5 day&#039;s,I ordered wednesday 10:54 am went into transit thursday&nbsp; messaged him monday the same day I got a package from spain got my order today wednesday so it seem&#039;s obvious some order&#039;s didn&#039;t get sent out and he&#039;s waiting on people to message him,you will get your order&#039;s, but yeah a little communication goes a long way.<br />Peace.<br />&nbsp;8)

				I ordered 14g of thai nearly a month ago, it was marked as in transit a day later. ...Hasn&#039;t arrived. It is an international order but a short one - I have never waited longer than a week for postage from UK once it was actually posted. I finalized early so I guess I have to accept the loss. Both interception/loss of the package and selective scam seem extremely unlikely so I&#039;m not sure what to make of the situation.

				To be fair to him, he did end up delivering and apologizing for the slow service. He just needs to change that &quot;Next Day Delivery&quot; on his page and he will be dandy

				Same here. It was slower than expected but it turned up in the end and it was good. He&#039;s had some problems with Silk Road being really slow and to be fair I think he&#039;s been doing his best under the circumstances. In the end I did get a reply to my PM and he explained how the site being really slow makes it very difficult for him to respond to all the messages he gets. In the end it was all good&nbsp; ;D

				Glad to hear you got your parcel. How is that thai? I&#039;ve ordered 7g, I think it was sent out Sat so hope to get it soon. Did the parcel smell when it arrived? Just a lil bit worried my housemates might not approve of things coming through the mail. It was my 1st order and I FE&#039;d, wish I didn&#039;t now, not saying MrCronk is a scammer in any way but I would feel better if I hadn&#039;t.

				How did yours end up Oddworld? I just bought the very same thing and am now starting to wonder if it was a good idea.<br /><br />I ordered last Thursday, and as per many others&#039; experiences he processed it quickly to get his FE but I haven&#039;t heard anything since.<br />I sent a message earlier today but (although he&#039;s visited SR) it&#039;s still sitting unread.<br /><br />I need it by the weekend, so if it&#039;s going to be less &#039;next day&#039; and more like a month (as some people have reported!) I&#039;ll need to make alternative plans...<br /><br />EDIT: The guy just got back to me, he&#039;s checked my order and it went out on Friday. So comms at least are OK.<br /><br />Sent late on Friday, first class post, maybe could still be due tomorrow? I&#039;ve ordered other stuff since which got to that address fine...

Maybe due to a lot of orders. I did FE. Usually first class post arrives next day or the day after so hopefully it will arrive on Tuesday. The thai was OK, it got me high but it&#039;s pretty dry, hard and brown but is cheap so you kinda expect it.

				Yeah definitely - I&#039;ve got some smaller, nicer (and more expensive) bits and pieces too, this is intended for &#039;bulking out&#039; purposes so we don&#039;t run out.<br /><br />Good to hear yours came in the end, I was also quite reassured when he got back to me. Based on what I&#039;ve read, I think the worst case will be it arrives too late and I&#039;ll have to scramble for some back-up weed later this week. And better late than never, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll get through it all soon enough :)<br /><br />EDIT: Arrived Wed (15th), on weight and pretty good stealth. Quality is as Oddworld described. I think 6 days is the standard for this guy ATM - not bad for SR but somewhat different from the &#039;next day delivery&#039; advertised.<br /><br />It came before the weekend so I&#039;m happy.

				You know what? I ended up giving the last 3-4 g of my Thai away.<br />Just no strength at all, smelt faint &amp; weird, and I did end up finding sticks and seeds in the bottom of the baggie.<br /><br />The possibility of it having been vaporised before sold was suggested to me, but I wouldn&#039;t know.<br /><br />It was cheap, on weight and if you properly bucket it you may get somewhere so I won&#039;t call it a scam - rather a learning experience:<br />1) you get what you pay for<br />2) Time to look outside the UK for weed*<br /><br />*Not because there&#039;s no good UK sellers (e.g. le Magnifique), just relatively few and all pricey.
