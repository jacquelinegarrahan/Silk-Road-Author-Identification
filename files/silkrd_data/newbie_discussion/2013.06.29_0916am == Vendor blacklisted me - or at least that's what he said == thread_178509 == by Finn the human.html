				Hi guys,<br /><br />Just wondering how can a vendor blacklist you.<br /><br />I only started buying off SR recently and I dealt with DutchMagic 3 weeks ago, yet the vendor has been very unreasonable and rather rude when the package, he presumes he sent away, has not arrived. Bought a pack of 5x1gs of different strains as this vendor looked reliable to start with, and after 2 weeks of the package not arriving (his vendor page says 2-4 days shipping), I have messaged him. He was slightly rude to start with without giving any real resolution to the issue so decided to go to resolution centre instead.<br /><br />He advised to wait another week and then we&#039;ll talk about reshipping.<br /><br />On that Friday, messaged him as I have not received the package still, however vendor changed his mind about reshipping, yet he posted a 55% refund on the resolution centre if I give him a 5/5 feedback.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you, but I found this rather rude as I don&#039;t care about the money and I was expecting him reship instead as previously mentioned and to ask for a 5/5 feedback was rather cheeky knowing the circumstances.<br /><br />I should mention that when bought this item, vendor gave me a shipping date, and in my 2 week message sent, he mentioned another shipping date (2 days later than first mentioned). I found this a bit suspicious as he didnt seem to keep his story straight.<br /><br />After days in resolution, I have received 50% refund from SR Support and left a 2/5 feedback simply because I am very unhappy with the way he dealt in this situation, his rudeness showed over private messages, changing his mind about reshipping, demanding for a 5/5 feedback, etc.<br /><br />I thought we were allowed to say the truth about vendors when leaving feedback but clearly not as i have received an email from the vendor saying he blacklisted me.<br /><br />My only question is: How can a seller blacklist you and on what grounds? How can buyers be protected in these situations?<br /><br />Thanks

				Don&#039;t worry about no &quot;blacklist&quot; mate its just him trying to bully you<br /><br />As long as your refund rate and AF stats are cool you&nbsp; will be cool bro<br /><br />He is trying to be a bully and scare you, do not give in to it. <br /><br />The blacklist is bull shit, 99% of the vendors only use their personal blacklist

				Most vendors just say that to get you to leave the score an feedback they want. If he noticed you were somewhat new to the road he felt he could scare you. <br /><br />There is a Area in the &#039;VENDORSROUNDTABLE&quot; forum where only vendors are allowed an they can put your name down somewhere there, but most other vendors dont pay attention to it. Your good to go, Do like you did an continue to tell the truth in feedback and rate them honestly, thats what will keep others from having issues ya knw! <br /><br />

				Hi Finn, <br /><br />I have suggested you be blacklisted in the Vendor Round Table forums, which you have no access to as a buyer. It&#039;s up to every vendor to decide if they will do business with you. I will certainly not consider ever shipping to you again. This is not a bullying tactic, this is a right that we reserve. Just as you reserve the right to leave us a low feedback rating including whatever story you seem to have concocted and to which I cannot reply. <br /><br />Furthermore, I would appreciate if you stop manipulating facts about our transaction. You have been given a 50% refund by SR staff, even though I offered you 55% in resolution. There is a reason they sided with me as vendor; you have been unreasonable in your insistent demands for a 100% refund and your unwillingness to share the risk of a lost order. <br /><br />Lastly, I have never promised you a reship: I said I would CONSIDER it. Such a consideration is to be made at our own discretion, not by you as a buyer. And certainly not a buyer who has proven himself to be unaccommodating and unreasonable. You kept on insisting on a 100% refund in the resolution center even when I offered you a refund when at the time you were not eligible due to your low stats. How is offering someone a refund, when they have no right to this according to the terms &amp; conditions to which you agreed, bad customer service? I have been in this postition before: A buyer wants a reship, he does not receive the reship and then STILL want&#039;s a 100% refund on top of the reship. No thank you, no more reships. <br /><br />I suggest you change your attitude towards other vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178509.msg1288297#msg1288297">Quote from: Finn the human on June 29, 2013, 09:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />After days in resolution, I have received 50% refund from SR Support and left a 2/5 feedback simply because I am very unhappy with the way he dealt in this situation, his rudeness showed over private messages, changing his mind about reshipping, demanding for a 5/5 feedback, etc.<br /><br />I thought we were allowed to say the truth about vendors when leaving feedback but clearly not as i have received an email from the vendor saying he blacklisted me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here is a transcript of our messages (to be read from bottom up). Let everyone decide for themselves how &quot;rude&quot; I have been to you. If anyone can show me where I explicitly and unequivocally offered you a reship, I will send this person 10g White Widow free of charge. <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#039;t know why I have to explain myself to you. You have done this to yourself.<br /><br />You said if I wait until Friday, you will reship. When Friday came and messaged you privately, not on the resolution centre, to be a mature human being and solve this like 2 adults, you have decided to go on the resolution centre and put a 55% refund and be cheeky about it by asking a 5/5 feedback. I have explained to you after that, that I want you to reship and at that point, you would have received the full money and a 5/5 feedback because I am not such a horrible person, yet you decided against it, and had the cheek to pretend I am a scammer instead.<br /><br />I am sorry, but I had to warn the other buyers of your horrendous customer service and horrible way to deal in these situations when yourself was the one asking to wait until Friday and that you would gladly reship but you want some trust, which was given by waiting as you specifically requested.<br /><br />I have lost money because of you and now you have been again the most horrible vendor I ever dealt with on SR by reporting me. Unsure how you can expect a 5/5 feedback after the way you dealt with this situation. I wish you all the best in the future, hope what you did was worth it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finn,<br /><br />We have upheld our end of the bargain and yet you still rate us 2/5. Do you not wonder why SR staff only gave you 50% even though I offered 55%? It&#039;s because you are being unreasonable and manipulative. You have been blacklisted by the vendor round table, any serious vendor will be wary of you.<br /><br />Best,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Finn,<br /><br />I cannot agree to a reship, in part due to your unreasonable attitude towards wanting a 100% refund.

I would still like to suggest we wait until the weekend before we discuss the appropriate way to resolve this issue. I&#039;m still confident it should arrive, as I agree with you that it&#039;s unlikely (but possible) that your order was intercepted by dutch post, dutch customs, uk customs or uk post (I have an acquaintance who worked for the post and he tells me many of his colleagues keep an eye out for interesting packages to get &quot;lost&quot;).<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />Finn the human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi DM,<br /><br />No one has called you liars, but while I am to place myself into your shoes, you should do the same. For someone that buys from you for the first time and received 2 emails with different shipping date, two things come in mind, 1. You have shipped it on the 4th, Dutch Mail takes 2 days to process the order and takes a very very long time to arrive which is a bit unlikely for EU to EU packages (speaking from experience) and 2. You have missed the order as I have mentioned, in human error as we all humans, and this is why nothing has been received or advised of being caught into customs especially that as you said you are receiving over 150 emails a day and a load of orders too.<br /><br />Its hard to trust someone which you never even spoke to or never bought from before, especially when the first order you have made does not arrive even 2 weeks after being placed and being told I has been shipped on 2 different dates. I understand where you are coming from but also you have to understand where I am coming from.<br /><br />If you consider a reship to make everything better, trust comes with it, and my sincere apologies I had to go this far, but you have to understand I am only trying to also protect my interests and investments.<br /><br />Looking forward to your reply.<br /><br />Many thanks<br />Finn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Finn,<br /><br />Having just read your lengthy resolution request for a 100% refund, I feel quite disappointed with your attitude towards this situation. I feel you&#039;re implying we are running a scam, which is not only completely not true, it doesn&#039;t even make sense from a business perspective. I would consider a reship, but I would also appreciate some trust. I don&#039;t see how a lost package automatically brands us as liars. Also, we have not changed our story. I hope you realize we are serving dozens of customers a day, english is not my mother tongue and responding in length to more than 150 mails a day takes it&#039;s toll on accuracy. I feel I was eventually able to explain the situation in detail, but for some reason this turns me into a liar. Please place yourself in my shoes. I realize losing an order is problematic for you, but when someone says they don&#039;t trust you, well.. thats hard not to take personally.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Finn,<br /><br />I think we should wait until the autofinalize counts down to within 24 hours. By that time, your order should surely have arrived. I agree with you, it&#039;s taking too long. I do remember that you forgot to add United Kingdom to your address, but I think we corrected that before it was sent out. Please double check your address in the future.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />Finn the human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;ve received numerous orders from the U.S and EU within 4 days of ordering with 100% success rate, which is why I find it odd I am still waiting for my package 13 (6 business since dispatch) days later<br /><br />Understandably there is always the slim chance it was caught in customs, so, please specify a date from which that I should consider my order failed if it hasn&#039;t arrived, so that I can place another.<br /><br />Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We even took the time to customize your order (no cheese). I feel you&#039;re being a bit unfair.<br />Best,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Finn,<br /><br />I think you misunderstood my explanation and also misread our profile. Your order was shipped on the 4th, and handled by Dutch Post on the 6th. Our page specifies indications of delivery times, not guarantees. They come straight from the Dutch Post website. We have no control over shipping after it has been sent out, you must realise this. What woud you have me do?<br /><br />Best,<br />DM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />Finn the human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order placed on the 2nd, told order shipped on the 4th, not informed until the 12th that order actually shipped on the 6th....bad business practice. If I order something on a Saturday I don&#039;t think it&#039;s unreasonable to expect it by the following weekend when EU-EU when vendor page specifies 2-4 days.<br /><br />Plenty of alternate vendors on SR, not how customers should be treated.<br /><br />Regards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />DutchMagic(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Finn,<br /><br />Thanks for the update. Your package was sent out on the 6th so technically it has now been underway for 4 business days. I&#039;m sure it will arrive soon.

Actually I think the whole SR feedback system is horrible, but it&#039;s what we as vendors must deal with nonetheless. I do not demand anyone to FE and give 5/5 before actually shipping, as many other vendors do. No, we just expect to be treated fairly, but that makes &quot;protecting&quot; our ratings of prime importance. <br /><br />Yes, I offered Finn a 55% refund if he would kindly consider not leaving us poor feedback. I offer that to everyone who has lost a package, usually with a letter of customs. Finn did not have this letter, neither the correct statistics to be eligible for refund. Yet, I tried to help a newbie customer. He insisted on a reship and as you have all been able to read in the transcript above, I never promised him a reship, only that I would consider doing so. And this is the thank you he wrote me: 2/5<br /><br />EU to EU never arrived, poor communication, seller not very understanding but rather rude on my first order, ended up in resolution centre for days before any part refund was given with no chance of reshipping.<br /><br />Revised: This vendor has blacklisted me because of the 2/5 feedback left, however I cannot give a 5/5 for a vendor that deals so poorly in situations like these, knowing the high chance of your package being seized. He first said he will reship if I wait until Friday, then when Friday came, he changed his mind and had the cheek to ask for a 5/5 feedback as well. Lost money and time with this vendor and I submitted this feedback to warn the next buyers regarding his attitude when things are not going well. Buyers will always lose and if a buyer won&#039;t give him a 5/5 feedback, they will get blacklisted, this is the reason why he has such good feedback, intimidation works on some people very well. It is a risk to take to deal on SR, but it is still a business and money are involved, think twice before making such step.

				The truths in the pudding right there. as proven by the transcript, dutchmagic kept his cool, and in no was rude or offered a reship. it looks to me like it was Finn that was being rude and demanding. feedback should always be honest in your opinion no one else should influence that or use it as a weapon to get there own way. that&#039;s not what we are all here for.

I found this a bit suspicious as he didnt seem to keep his story straight.<br /><br />After days in resolution, I have received 50% refund from SR Support and left a 2/5 feedback simply because I am very unhappy with the way he dealt in this situation, his rudeness showed over private messages, changing his mind about reshipping, demanding for a 5/5 feedback, etc.<br /><br />I thought we were allowed to say the truth about vendors when leaving feedback but clearly not as i have received an email from the vendor saying he blacklisted me.<br /><br />My only question is: How can a seller blacklist you and on what grounds? How can buyers be protected in these situations?<br /><br />Thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />This idiot said that to me too!

				NOT FINISHED either...... That RUDE prick sole me the 5 x 1g sample pack also. Came in 5 separate satchels. They were ALL unlabeled. All the weed looked, smelled &amp; smoked the same. Basically it was the same weed (decades as a smoker). When i asked nicely what was the go with what happened &amp; which strain did i actually smoke he was adamant that he is the first human being on earth that makes entirely no errors and i was &quot;in his words, trying to scam a free smoke&quot;, and he was told in no uncertain terms &quot;fuck him, fuk any refund, &amp; to shove his BOGWEED up his nostril! That&#039;s when the blacklist threat came about. Someone needs to make a &quot;RUDE, ARROGANT &amp; OUTRIGHT CHILDISH VENDORS thread &amp; whack his name right up there. <br />

Not everyone who gets a wrong order or not at all is trying to &quot;lie &amp; scam&quot; as you so boldly put it to me.

				Well since its all been handled by sr staff an there is nothing futher can be done, i think this is a dead subject. <br /><br />Both vendor an buyer have made their feelings clear, The vendor DM just like any other you deal with can put u in the blacklist in the vendor forums. It doesnt mean you can never make a order again OP. Its just a warning for others to watch out.<br /><br />Just like you came here an warned us Buyers an how you felt he did the same in the vendors round table, Both of you are in the right far as that goes. <br /><br />Unless im missing something the vendor was very reasonable. He offered you more than what you got from SR STAFF. <br /><br />I notice where Many new buyers dont read a vendors profile an terms before ordering. Even me being a Vet buyer i still always read from top to bottom what a vendor says on his profile. The whole year iv been hear and almost 60 transactions I have NEVER Lost a Order or ever had a issue but with 1 vendor. That was only cause the vendor was new an didnt know the drill well, but made up for it.<br /><br />OP i understand you frustration, but from the Transcript posted i just dont see where this vendor was at anytime a rude asshole, He was willing to go out his way for you even though you were/are a newbie and are not privileged to certain refunds/reships. <br /><br />It seems like Both sides hae spoken an is all out, so IMO shouldnt this be the end of the subject?<br /><br />Take it easy an travel safe vendors an buyers.

I don&#039;t know who you are, but the fact that you have set up an anonymous forum account with just 2 posts says enough. Of more than 1000 orders since we opened in the past 3 months, I have only had a dispute 3 times and suggested blacklisting twice, users FINN THE HUMAN and TISCONFUSION (both not vendors). So I guess we know who you are after all. <br /><br />Thanks :) <br /><br />I will stop being antagonized any further now. Bye

So you didn&#039;t get your weed, you need to calm the fuck down. After reading through everything here, evidently both sides have a reason to be frustrated at one another, but DM did make a generous and sincere solution, 55%. And how can you expect a reship when he said he will &#039;CONSIDER&#039; it. I&#039;m fairly new to SR, having 3 successful transactions and one Pending one, My latest transaction took way longer than usual, but i had trust in the Vendor I was dealing with because of the good communication, I eventually received it. There was nothing the DM said which was Rude nor was he being unreasonable. He maintained very good communication in my opinion, a hell lot more than 2 of the vendors I dealt with. Be thankful for what he went through.<br /><br />You rating was very subjective finn and I understand trust is an issue, but its something everyone has to deal with here and why not try to make the best of it by being a respectful and understanding buyer? <br />As well as slandering everything and trying to keep your ego up. <br /><br />For all you know you might receive your package in time if you wait some more, you never know. You got your 50% refund at least.<br />Sorry my english is shit and i might be off a little... But shame on you Finn.

It was all the same shit and supposed to be a 5 different strain sample pack.You need to leave this thread because you have made yourself out to be an IDIOT! If you are going to quote a person then you need to in future make sure that the next point you make is actually relevant. <br /><br />Fuck u 2 DM. Your blacklist means Zero! I already have another 3 orders in. 1 blacklist from a Dutchmen against over 20 successful &amp; pending transactions. Hopefully i won&#039;t come across many more &quot;up themselves&quot; vendors like you. They have all been a breath of fresh air since you!

At the time I was just annoyed at what Finn had supposedly claimed when evidence is evidence; and how immature it was of him to make another account.

I don&#039;t think I&#039;m making myself look like an idiot because it was a mistake, and if you read through it properly, maybe you would have realized at some point that it was directed to Finn, not you?? even though I did post it right below your quote which was the mistake.<br /><br />Fuck it why am i coming back to this thread to reply to you?
