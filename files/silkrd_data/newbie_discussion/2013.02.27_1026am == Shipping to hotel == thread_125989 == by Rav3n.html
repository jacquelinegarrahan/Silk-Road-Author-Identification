				Hi everyone, <br /><br />Without giving too much away, I&#039;ve had several orders from SR delivered within the UK. <br /><br />In a few months time I will be traveling to the USA and I would like to have some MDMA pills. For obvious reasons I won&#039;t be taking them on the plane with me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve looked and found some sellers in the US and was thinking of ordering a couple days before I fly out and have it shipped to the hotel. I can call ahead of time and tell them I&#039;m expecting a letter. <br /><br />Some problems I may face:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Do hotels open packages that get delivered?<br />&nbsp;- If it is opened, would they be able to tell? Without giving packaging details away, if you were to open a letter from my current supplier you wouldn&#039;t necessarily be able to tell what it is unless you opened it further. How could I go about asking a seller if they use the same method?<br />&nbsp;- If it gets intercepted, do I really have plausible deniability? I&#039;ve told them I&#039;m expecting a package.

				I&#039;ve never heard of a Hotel opening customer packages.&nbsp; If your concerned about not having plausible deniability then order an extra cheap package from somewhere else along with your SR package.

				I&#039;ve done it before...its similar to ordering a package to a university dorm or staff serviced apartment complex. In my opinion, the nicer the hotel and the nicer your room, the easier it is to get a package there. You don&#039;t have to worry about any hotels opening them...the only concern would be the package getting lost. <br /><br />Moreover, why not bring the MDMA on the plane? Thats also my forte, I mean shit smuggling any non-organic substance onto a plane is a piece of cake and if you do it right is impossible to be discovered. Especially pills. Throw them in an aspirin bottle and you should be fine man.

				In the US, I think it&#039;s against the law for a hotel to open up mail addressed to you.
