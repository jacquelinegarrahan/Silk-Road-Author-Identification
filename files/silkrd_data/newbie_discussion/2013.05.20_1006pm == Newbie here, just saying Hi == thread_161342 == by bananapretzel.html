				Hola and welcome bananapretzel,<br /><br />I&#039;m quite new myself (5 months), but have done quite a few transactions and they have all gone well - read, read, read, the wiki, the forums, the vendor reviews, and trust in the authorative voices of Scout and Libertas on the forums. Don&#039;t give anything away that identifies you and make sure you only access through Tor itself and not through proxies, that is what I have learned here.<br /><br />Good times ahead, take care.

				Yeah the possibility of never having to rely on an irl dealer again is just...&nbsp; so very attractive.&nbsp; Not even necessarily because they did anything malicious, but they&#039;ve all just been suck total flakes.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sure none of them had any idea what they were selling any more than I had of what I was buying.&nbsp;

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently.

				Hey everyone!<br /><br />I said that I&#039;d post a review on the forums for this vendor who had some great service and a great product, and now I&#039;ve found out about this 50 post rule. Kinda annoying, but it cuts down on spam so it&#039;s for the greater good.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve found is that a lot of ordering etiquette and precautions are just common sense, but I suppose I&#039;m lucky cause I basically only order blotter-based products domestically, so it&#039;s nowhere near as risky as what some others have ordered.

				Welcome playpiano there is masses of info on here about BTC but it is a mercurial and ever-changing scene. Sure you will get it together, and once you have BTC, have a great shopping experience here on this remarkable site.<br /><br />This is the cutting-edge of a social revolution, glad to have you along&nbsp; :)
