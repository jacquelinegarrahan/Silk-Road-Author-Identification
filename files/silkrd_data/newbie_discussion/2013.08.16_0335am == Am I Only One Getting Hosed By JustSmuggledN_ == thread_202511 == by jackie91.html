				I placed an order with JustSmuggledN on Monday. They lost my address so I resent it. My order has been &quot;Processing&quot; since I placed it (I can cancel in about 18 hours). They haven&#039;t read but one of my messages, some of them have been unread for 3 days. My money is tied up and I&#039;m not going to get my order apparently. The one message they read, and asked me to resend my address, they said my order would go out first thing today. It&#039;s still sitting in Processing. <br />This blows. I have decided I am only going to work with vendors I know are stand-up sellers. No more trying new vendors when they come on board. By now I know who the good, reliable, responsive ones are. I may miss out on some deals but I&#039;m also going to miss out on headaches and getting screwed.<br />Am I the only one JustSmuggledN is screwing?

				Well they sold fake MDMA pills to a lot of people.&nbsp; They are advertised as containing 225mg MDMA but they contain no MDMA at all. :-\

				I just looked at their review thread on Rumor Mill and everyone is raving. I also looked at CaptainSnowFlakes on Rumor Mill and everyone was raving about him also. I didn&#039;t see any negatives on either vendor.<br />I bought from Captain SnowFlakes and he sent me less than good quality product. Did numerous tests on it and it didn&#039;t test well, cooked it up, lost more than 50% and cooked product didn&#039;t provide a pleasurable experience. In other words it was marginal quality at best. I PM&#039;d him to discuss the feedback I was going to leave and he went nuts on me, called me stupid and dishonest among other things.<br />Why do these vendors get all these raves when they clearly don&#039;t always deserve them?<br />Why aren&#039;t there any negatives on the review threads?

				This is the issue I&#039;m going through as well.&nbsp; I buy something that they say is 50%+ quality...it doesnt do shit.&nbsp; I went out and get a test, and it registers between 0-10% purity.&nbsp; Its basically sand in a bag. Now vendor doesn&#039;t message me back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank god for escrow (That is, if the SR Support Staff takes my side, anyhow..I&#039;ve never had an issue with ANYTHING I have purchased on SR :/).

				Thanks for the info. I can cancel my order in 7 hours and I am going to hit CANCEL the minute it shows on the screen. I just left them a message on their Review Thread on the Rumor Mill (now I have 50+ so I can post there!). <br />Sorry that you got ripped off, you can use my experience when you go to resolution if you like. Maybe it will help support your case. I have no problem helping out.

				You&#039;re awesome :).&nbsp; I am glad to hear you can at least cancel your order, and it hasn&#039;t been set to &#039;In Transit&#039;.&nbsp; Good luck, and thanks again for the offer!

				Yeah - here&#039;s hoping it doesn&#039;t advance to In Transit before you can cancel, m8.

				I don&#039;t think it will be put &quot;in transit&quot;. I think part of the problem was I used PGP for my address (I always do!) and I think they don&#039;t know how to use PGP. That&#039;s just a guess based on them having to ask for my address a second time and then still not moving my order when I sent the address encrypted. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re very sophisticated when it comes to some of the finer details.<br />Thank you very much for the good wishes! I appreciate that. May your goodness come back to you in equal measure :)
