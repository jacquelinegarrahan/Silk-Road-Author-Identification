				Hi people<br /><br />Lot&#039;s of buyers used to buy Larghetto&#039;s adderall? Has anyone received an order since April ?<br /><br />I ordered on March 28 did something really stupid (F/E) because we did business before (a few times) and i was about to go on holiday for two weeks.<br /><br />I payed : à¸¿6.36 and I haven&#039;t got anything. There&#039;s also no communication and the product is not listed anymore.<br /><br />Also, can anyone inform me if Larghetto responds to messages ? My last message to him was send more than two weeks ago and he still didn&#039;t read it. (it&#039;s still in bold in the send mail folder). Has anyone had any recent communications with the guy ?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Eternal

				Here is my last experience with Larghetto:<br /><br />A month ago i make purshases from him for 15 btc total.<br />At the same time i write to him for arrengment with the EMS option and tracking.<br /><br />I wait 2 days , no answers.<br />Then i decide to FE as requested in the automatic message thinking my orders will popup first in the list.<br /><br />We are a MONTH after, i received nothing and he still refuse to answer my messages. <br />I tried pgp, tried his mail adress, and even pm him in the forum.<br />I know he still taking new orders so he select who to read.<br /><br />I have downgraded my review notes to 1/5 till he start to communicate with me.<br /><br />

				Shit... I&#039;ve ordered 50 Onax (XANAX) bars just the day before yesterday, and sent a message to Larghetto with a question about another listing... and he still did not read my message but his profile page says that he was online today...<br />Have I got real chances to get scammed?

				He got back to me<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br /><br />We will reship this item since you haven&#039;t received it. You may actually receive this order twice I add (keep the second for free).<br /><br />I will have a tracking number for you early next week. Please message me for it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, we will take care of you. I know we&#039;ve done business in the past. We will get you this ID.<br /><br /><br />Best regards,<br />Larghetto

				Since my transaction was paid in March my feedback is buried on page 10 of his feedback profile so I have copied and pasted over to here the feedback I posted for Larghetto here in the Newbies maybe someone will see it and NOT&nbsp; buy from him!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />SINCE MARCH...NO TRACKING #!! NOTHING REFUNDED!! NOTHING RESHIPPED!! NO EMAILS ANSWERED!! finally I get an email with 3 words &quot;it was sent&quot;<br />I am making a request of everyone who is reading feedback here, considering a purchase PLEASE HELP US SHUT THIS SELLER OUT spend your money with another seller there are a lot of good sellers on SR. This seller does not deserve to receive another cent from anyone on here until he makes good with EVERY ONE HE HAS STOLEN from!! His guarantees are just warm and fuzzy words typed out to make you feel this is a risk free deal.ANYTHING can happen and he has your back, HOW MANY NEGATIVE FEED BACKS DO YOU HAVE TO READ!? I&#039;m Old School, taught you live within a code of ethics. Everyone here is vulnerable, the question of trust is the most important question asked in the forums. We WANT to know the SR community operates under a code of ethics. The feedback system is in place to make known a sellers trustworthiness. THIS SELLER IS NOT a TRUSTWORTHY seller for ALL OF US, not even the larger percentage of the people he deals with! Meaning he&#039;s ripped off the MAJORITY OF PEOPLE who trusted him! KNOWING we have no recourse. WRONG! Our recourse, as a community should be to just STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH HIM UNTIL HE GOES AWAY.

				Larghetto is on silcroad IRC everyday.&nbsp; He is a very well known scammer.&nbsp; He sometimes calls himself &quot;SR public enemy #1&quot; on IRC.

				I guess the only way to learn is to ask, what is IRC?&nbsp; and my burning question is, WHY is he still allowed to sell on SR?&nbsp; IF he ever was a trusted seller as some claim, he is not trustworthy now and nothing more than an arrogant, opportunist thief.&nbsp; What does it take to lose your seller privileges on here anyway?&nbsp; I thought a seller was not allowed to retain a customers info., is that true and what are the consequences of doing so?

				@ Jack N Hoff&nbsp; Thank you! Very kewl of you to help me along with that info.&nbsp; I went to Wiki and searched IRC after I had posted the question on it so right on time with the instructions.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to get on there and at least get him in the hot seat.&nbsp; Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned! tis true, lol<br /><br />@ dirtybiscuitzz718&nbsp; &nbsp;Larghetto was my 1st (and last actually) dealing. I was aware of the Forums but had not been to them.&nbsp; I was not aware of the necessity of researching sellers in advance in the forums.&nbsp; I actually did NOT FE and he was not very pleased with my refusal but said my package had been sent and 4 days later he sent several msg&#039;s because BC&#039;s were taking a dive in value and feeling bad for him I went ahead and FE&#039;d.....still my bad I know.&nbsp; I am thinking a lot of people consider SR a place where you&#039;re &quot;SAFE&quot; once you get here and that we are all on the same team yaddayadda.....you get it I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am actually kind of blown away by the misuse of a seller account, which I understand is not the easiest to get, but even more blown away by his being allowed to retain that account.&nbsp; There&#039;s no &quot;stealth in his scamming&quot; but why should there be when apparently there are no negative consequences? and it sounds like he feels above reproach about it on the IRC choosing usernames that he finds clever and amusing.&nbsp; Sorry got on a rant, can&#039;t stand this type of worthless scum
