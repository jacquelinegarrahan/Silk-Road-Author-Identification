				In my experience the claims made by the people who sell these things, are greatly exaggerated. <br /><br />The only fruit machine hack I&#039;ve seen that works, is the EMP zap. And even that burns out after a while. <br /><br />Ask yourself, if you REALLY can use this thing to make $200 a day, why on earth is he selling it? Better to keep it quiet, no?<br /><br /><br />A fool and his money are easily parted. <br /><br />Also, its surprising what you can save if you shop around...... <br />&nbsp;http://forum.ixgames.com/casino-forum/24869-slot-machines-apps-any-caino-bar-world.html

				Thx for the links, yes its interesting seems to same man with lower price.<br /><br />What im only thinking of this that he sold this product to 6 man.<br />And if he just buy with fake accounts it costs 6X40 BTC for him. (because of the SR 10%)<br />It is too much invest for only scammed people.<br /><br />And the other thing that he has got very sucesfull sell rate in other thing too.

				The risk vs reward is probably better when selling the tool than when using it.<br /><br />Would you guys risk getting caught if you had the ability to get or make these tools?

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pokies are programmed by mathematics that are dominated by odds, chance, and unlike a horse race, they are controlled by laws that can be broken and bent. These laws of mathematics stay true when bent and this is what clouds the result with a new kind of outcome which I have programmed to do what I want and the pokies can&#039;t do anything about it, because my program has overcome the barriers once faced by people wanting to hack the pokies. Using these laws as a foundation to modify the result is how I made a program that changes the &quot;random&quot; way of viewing pokies to a much more brittle, obeying kind of logic that answers to one and its own, invariably.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If this guy&#039;s a programmer, I&#039;ve got the brooklyn bridge to sell.
