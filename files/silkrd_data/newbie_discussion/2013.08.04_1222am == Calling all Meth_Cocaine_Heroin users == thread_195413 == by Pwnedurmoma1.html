				so, when i was growing up i smoked a lotta pot, did ecstasy, drank some beer, normal teenager shit, hardest drug ive done is ketamine, i&#039;ve been around a lot of people who use heroin, meth, cocaine, aka hard drugs, but i told myself i wouldnt try that shit cause i would always want more and one of my friends used heroin responsibly, like once per 3 months, how the hell did he do that i wondered, an extremely addictive substance, how did he control it, and ik strong self will, but i would like some answers from ex or current meth/heroin/cocaine/crack/any hard drug users about how you can do that stuff, yet have the money to buy bitcoins and a computer, and what it feels like to do it, sorry if this is biased against hard drug users, i have no problem with anyone who uses a substance as long as they arent using it around children or animals, als

				There&#039;s lotsa casual users out there. Lots a folks think if you do H then your living in a cardboard box yet those same people have no problem running prescription scams for opiates.&nbsp; I know plenty of hard working family guys who just dabble. Some never had a problem, some did and learned that they have to limit their use so as to not go back there.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for meth, I&#039;ve never tried it but H and C I enjoy . Gotta be careful though and not let it get a hold of ya.&nbsp; As far as the money part, lotsa guys wind up sniffing a little H here n there because buying oxy&#039;s n such just got too expensive.

				First you need to understand there are two types of &quot;hard drug&quot; users,&nbsp; there&#039;s the &quot;junkies&quot; who don&#039;t work lie,cheat steal and beg to support there habit which normally means one hit a day to stop withdraws thats all they can useually get.<br />Then there are drug addicts(i consider myself in this group as i use H everyday but work to support my habit) normally buy drugs to get high not just keep withdraws at bay, can be fully functioning members of society.<br />Just because you use a &quot;hard drug&quot; doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t be organised the buying bitcoins thing is stupid as im going to buy drugs with them so its not really something extra im buying, as for computer even when i was homeless i still was able to use computer cafes with TOR on a usb to order to randoms houses and just sit waiting for the mailman.<br />Then there are other people who can use every now and the consider them the same as someone who only drinks or smokes when they go out socially its the same thing they enjoy it once in a while to relax unwind have fun whatever <br />Using meth/coke/heroin once wont make you addicted use heroin for 2-3 days in a row and you will develop a physical addiction same with meth and coke its more the mental &quot;fuck that was such a great high i wanna be like that again &quot; so they use the next day and the next and bam addicted but the first hit of heroin is always the best ive had good once after the first but the first is the best it will every be and no matter how hard you chace that high you wont find it again...&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve always been a casual user. At first I tried a little bit of this and that, and gradually I realized that I could do anything without desperately wanting to do it again. It&#039;s just my personality.<br /><br />But honestly, some people have really addictive personalities and shouldn&#039;t try these things even once, or they WILL end up pawning their computers for crack money... It just depends on the individual.

				I&#039;m a recreational coke user who&#039;s also tried Meth and Oxycodone. You need to be on your guard when using these drugs not only because of their addictiveness, but also because of the withdrawal symptoms. I personally don&#039;t use Heroin or Meth because the combination of the intense high followed by unpleasant withdrawal symptoms make these drugs too difficult to manage, so it&#039;s easier just to stay away. Cocaine addiction is much more insidious, so I set limits ahead of time as to how much I&#039;ll use over the course of a month. A couple of times I exceeded those limits, and stopped using for a few months. Having the self-discipline to walk away from the drug is ultimately what separates the addicts from the recreational users.

				Im a recovering crack / heroin addict for almost 5 years. I&#039;ve been homeless and at rock bottom and have worked my arse off to get to where I am now in my life, and its not been an easy road.<br /><br />I do have the strength to not use those drugs, in fact I have never made an order for either of those drugs on SR, and hope I never do! Not to say I have not eyed them up at times!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />It usually takes a whole serious of events to lead to the life I walked, ordering drugs like that from here a couple of times probably wont lead you down it, but I think like someone already stated, the problem is not the drugs, its the individual, that destructive force inside me is still very much there, and it often takes a great deal for strength for me to stay clean... for most, they don&#039;t have it and will never understand it, much like the guy who no doubt started this thread, and dude, I hope you never have to :)<br />

				thats how I am, any substance that I choose to use I can regulate and set a limit for myself, all of it except for pot, honestly, i can snort ketamine on a limit without going over, oxycontin, hydrocodone, marinol, ecstasy, acid, mushrooms, i can drink with a limit, I can limit myself to like anything, including cigarettes which are &quot;oh so addictive&quot;, the last Time i smoked a cig was 5 weeks ago and it was only one, but if i have a steady supply of pot its like this: <br />ill smoke one day, then the next ill be eating and be like dude, i should eat this stoned, thatd be amazing (i have Appetite issues, its almost impossible for me to eat)<br />which is fine, but then i go dude, i should take a stoned shower, and get stoned at work, and on and on, before i know it im out of weed and im like oh, okay, whatever. but i honestly love pot more than i love any other drug, acid made me retarded, i took it and sat talking to a chair stuffed with drugs cause i thought it was my dead grandmother, i loved acid but i dont have any urge to do it again, but all i want right now is a bowl of weed, it sounds absolutely sublime

I think if you cant obtain anymore it helps quitting, but on the SR we all know theres whatever drug you can possibly imagine, sometimes when someone offers me crack or heroin or whatever drug, i say no thanks, cause in my mind i say, &quot;do i really want to travel down this path, its going to be harder to quit than to never start&quot;, if you dont mind me asking, what made you take that first hit of crack or that first bump/needle of heroin, didnt your mind tell you &quot;no, dont do this&quot; cause i for one dont believe in the &quot;gateway drug theory&quot;

				My story is pretty tragic man, My first hit came at the age of 13 of both Crack and H, and both came directly from my father (also an addict). I don&#039;t dwell on it all, whats done is done. <br /><br />I have been on and off both those drugs since that age. I am currently 5 years clean again, but have dabbled in that time. <br /><br />I would never claim to have beaten addiction, it sits with me every day, it has not, and never will go. It comes out in all areas of my life, it part of me, and will latch onto anything I allow it too.<br /><br />I often find myself close to walking that road again, but today I can say &quot;you know what, Ill give that a miss&quot;, Im in a good place in my life, but Im always fearful of a time when all is not so well, and I make that one silly choice!<br /><br />After all, any of us are only one choice away from that road!

				&nbsp; If I sold my computer then what would I do on meth?&nbsp; Meth would be the last thing I&#039;d want in that situation!<br /><br />&nbsp;I think a large part has to do with the type of people that are visible that use hard drugs vs the invisible ones.&nbsp; The visible people will generally be the ones in which its causing big problems (addiction is hard to hide.)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Non-addicts will rarely come out and tell someone (even if the person does drugs) that they use &quot;hard drugs.&quot;&nbsp; Very very few people that I know know that I&#039;ve ever done Methamphetamine.&nbsp; Its sort of funny I&#039;ve had conversations where people are telling me that Meth is the worst thing on earth not realizing they&#039;re talking to a person who enjoys it on occasion.&nbsp; <br />

				IMHO to become addicted a certain amount of dedication is needed. Curiosity alone isn&#039;t enough. If life isn&#039;t going well then the danger is much greater. Also people who are younger are more likely to get swept away by the excitement of it. If using stuff intravenously, the actual act of injecting becomes a powerful habit in its own right. As cryngie said earlier, taking an addictive or strongly habit-forming drug three days running is not a good idea, because it easily becomes four, then five... and, if the supply doesn&#039;t dry up, within a couple of weeks it&#039;s likely to have become a religion. Probably I was lucky coming across top quality psychedelics early on; my loyalties were already established! But with the ones you mentioned, it&#039;s not the addictiveness of the drug which is important; it&#039;s the addictive personality of the person taking it.
