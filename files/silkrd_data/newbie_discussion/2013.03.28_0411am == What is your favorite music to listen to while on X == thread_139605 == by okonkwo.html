				Anything by Bassnectar, he&#039;s the best there is IMO; at least his live stuff or his full sets.&nbsp; I love downtempo and breakbeats like Tipper Music, Flying Lotus, VibeSquaD and MiMOSA.&nbsp; If I&#039;m feeling funky I&#039;ll listen to The Funk Hunters or Featurecast.&nbsp; Thats just the tip of the iceberg. haha

				Most dubstep is cheesy, lame, lowest common denominator dance music, appealing to infantile punters who cant wait more than sixty seconds for a bass wobble drop. Awful muck. Avoid like the plague. Stuff like Skrillex makes me cringe.<br /><br />Anything that is longer, involving, slowly changing, some soul and groove to it. New York deep house, some of the Detroit House (not techno) stuff too - Omar S, Kyle Hall, Moodymann, etc. Producers like Ricardo Villalobos or Petre Inspirescu also for me walk a nice line between head and feet. Breach and Joy Orbison for UK based, garage tinged house.<br /><br />For pure out there insanity, Shackleton produces some of the best music. His tracks are pretty uncategorisable. Anything he touches is gold. If it wasnt associated with naff, hippie dross, you could call it &#039;trance&#039; music. Whenever I listen to that stuff, on MDMA, I am somewhere else. That doesnt happen that often any more.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
