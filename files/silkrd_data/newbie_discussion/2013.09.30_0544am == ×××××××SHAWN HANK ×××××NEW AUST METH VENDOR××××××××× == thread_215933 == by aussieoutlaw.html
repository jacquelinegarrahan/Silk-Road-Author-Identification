				First up I bought half gram off Shawn hank and once I got it Tues, I msged him to say I&#039;ll write a review. I msged Shawn monday,he was in touch in minutes, told him bit dismayed at my current vendors ,too dear , not that good Really...I ordered the half gram at 249$ on Mon midday,Tues morn it arrived. At my drop,a point from a Canadian vendor was there as well,been 3 weeks so I decided to palm that one off and try Shawn hank gear... I use iv,have had my share of grade d meth ,Mexican,US so know good from bad.. Also 9 domestic vendors in aus since April..stealth was terrific and on seeing the gear my heart raced like I&#039;d just had a hit. Usually I bang a whole point no problem, but went with half point of this. Called two mates who came to see the fuss. I made half point deals and told them half point of this is half price and a lot stronger than standard 100$ street points, well they agreed, so did the lucky ones who paid 50$ and are still going now... I have not written a review here before, but Shawn hank ,at the prices he&#039;s selling at I&#039;d say is very very very close to the source. I&#039;ve dealt&nbsp; meth before at 5000$ a half oz its about $36 cost,per point , so why charge 100, I&#039;m hoping prices will drop and they will have to, because once you have tried this gear my friends, you like me will not bother going anywhere else, its so far in front as best domestic meth its not funny, I bought 327$ half g last week, compared to that, I&#039;d pay an extra 100-150 for this. I&#039;m doing this so you guys can get onto this , he has access to PLENTY, he is here to stay, what a good guy, and the gear, do yourself a favour, if you like HIGH GRADE METH, this is as HIGH AS IT GETS. Look at the pictures, its that gear exactly. I&#039;m ordering again today Wednesday, and will probably go again Thursday,people love it... And BTW shawn posts twice a day 12pm and 4 pm I&#039;m pretty sure.Msg him, hhe is friendly helpful and knows a lot about meth , all correct ,i checked ,spend 125 for a .25 if you want ,but you will buy more the next day. At his prices, half g under$250 its daylight robbery, and we are the robbers for the first time. I&#039;m fairly sure will stay at this price, it&#039;s not new vendor sale, he is very very close to source so making a quid at these prices as is, there is room to look after couple mates and pay minimal amounts. I&#039;ll say meth prices will drop, its not as if you have this , a cheap rolls Royce, and then you will go pay more for less, customers won&#039;t come back this is in transit in couple hours, perfect stealth, express post. Take the Pepsi challenge, see if I&#039;m right I had to turn my phone off, everyone wanted it , until I decide what to do, pass on the love or look after number one, and you guys , which I&#039;ve done by writing this. <br />HE ALSO IS SELLING MDMA. I don&#039;t know much about that so if you want to write it up here give Shawn a yell and can do new one or can stick it on here.<br /><br />Edit....I was correcting some spelling errors and deleted topic by accident.....have reposted here....
