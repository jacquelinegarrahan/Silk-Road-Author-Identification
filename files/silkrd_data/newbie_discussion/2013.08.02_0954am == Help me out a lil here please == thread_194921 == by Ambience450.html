				Then why didn&#039;t you deposit enough money? Why not just go deposit what you need now? Really the transaction only takes a short time and it is better than asking for charity with no history of being a contributing member of the community.

I have spent a lot of time around here helping people out and never asked for anything. I have been offered &#039;charity&#039; and reciprocal generosity many times, but always because of acts and assistance I have provided. You are new here, welcome, but do not show up on day one asking for handouts because you made a mistake when you made your first deposit. The community does not know if you are only here for a one time deal and then gone. The community doesn&#039;t know if you are just some long time member who created a throwaway account to try and get a few free BTC... You see where I am going? You could easily just make a quick deposit and be all good. <br /><br />Again. Welcome and good luck to you.
