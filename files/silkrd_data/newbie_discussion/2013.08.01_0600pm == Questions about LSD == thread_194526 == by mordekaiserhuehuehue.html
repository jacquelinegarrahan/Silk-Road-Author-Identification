				So I have a little bit of bitcoins right now and I&#039;m wondering if I should just buy more weed or try LSD for the first time, I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m ready and if it&#039;s really worth it, I need some opinions here.&nbsp; I only tried weed so far and been smoking for ~1 month.<br /><br />Also probably worth mentioning that I will only be able to try it alone without anyone around me.<br /><br />And what dose would be best for a first try? is ~100uG good?<br /><br /><br /><br />Also I&#039;m probably going to order a little bit of 2C-B. Would trying that before LSD prepare me for LSD at all?

				If you are as drug naive as you say, I would be careful.&nbsp; I would recommend if you have to do it by yourself then just take half a hit for your first time.&nbsp; Go out in to the woods, get with nature, take half a hit of LSD and go hug some trees.&nbsp; If after 2 hours of so you feel good, take the other half of the hit.<br /><br />If everything goes well, next time you do it (wait at least 2-3 weeks to get your tolerance back down to zero) take 1 full hit.&nbsp; Practice taking that size dose a couple times.&nbsp; Next time try taking 2.&nbsp; Spend some time in that head space for a while and learn what you can.&nbsp; When you are REALLY ready - Dig in a take a full trip.&nbsp; Drop 3 and get ready for a beautiful time.<br /><br />Mind state and setting is everything.&nbsp; Read up as much as you can on erowid.org about how to make sure you understand what all this means.&nbsp; Read a bunch of trip reports and be prepared.&nbsp; AND HAVE FUN!&nbsp; LSD is the most beautiful molecule on this planet.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				LSD is amazing in the right mindset, and horrible in the wrong. Your trip is controlled by the direction of your mind. If you can let your mind go, and I mean let it go.. you will enjoy tripping. I would start with one hit. It can take up to 2 hours to feel it, although if its good it will most likely take 45 mins. If all you did was sit on your couch and watch tv or movies... it could be the best 5 hours you ever had with amazing visuals and thoughts you will remember long after the trip is over. Thats how it can go! If one hit does&#039;t do much for you, the next time try 2. If your the type that say&#039;s what the fuck, let me take 2 and see if it gets crazy.. you will enjoy tripping.

				My two cents... If you&#039;re new to psychedelics then I would defo recommend trying LSD before 2CB. LSD can be used as standard to judge other psychedelics against. It has a little of everything. OEV&#039;s, CEV&#039;s, head trip, and body load. Not extremely intense in one specific category like most RC&#039;s are. I&#039;ve been into psychedelics for about 20 years now and played with a good portion of the RC&#039;s out there. Now I&#039;m not trying to tell you what to do or sound like a know it all, because I certainly don&#039;t know it all, but if I was in your shoes I would start with getting LSD, MDMA, and mushrooms under my belt before moving on to the exotics. Some RC&#039;s can be overwhelming even to experienced psychonauts. Knock out the big 3 and see what you&#039;re more into; visuals, tactile stimulation, soul searching, and so on. You may want to rethink tripping alone, especially on your first trip. Could go really well, could be a total disaster. Good luck , be safe, and have fun.&nbsp;

				I never condone tripping inside but for your first time I&#039;d go with a lowish dose - 100 mcg or so to get a good experience and do it in a place that you&#039;re comfortable with if you&#039;re being alone.&nbsp; My first acid trip was alone in my house just to try it out before i shared it with some friends and it happened to be one of those dalai lama tabs that blew my fuckin head off.&nbsp; I was just sitting under the covers enjoying CEV crying to pink floyd and enjoying every second of it.&nbsp; Since then I always trip outside in nature but as long as you don&#039;t just watch TV or play on the computer inside and put on some good music you should be fine.&nbsp; And weed seems to help everything so feel free to smoke up too.

				Oh and mushrooms are my suggestion if you&#039;re just entering the psychedelic field.&nbsp; Chomp up a few grams and have a good mindset going in.&nbsp; If you&#039;re comfortable in the woods alone thats always a good choice.&nbsp; I used to have a tripping spot in the woods with a fire pit and I made lots of good memories and learned a lot about myself shroomin in nature.

				You should do some research before your first trip.<br /><br />Make sure in advance you have the proper set and setting.<br /><br />Start out with a small dose.<br /><br />LSD can be very helpful and therapeutic if used correctly and you are not a psycho.<br /><br />Good luck and happy trails!!&nbsp; ;)
