				Well I am a newbie over a month on here and i have made several orders like you do and everything has been fine and dandy but i have been waiting for over 2 and a half weeks for a delivery. I wont say who from cause i know who i brought from has an excellent reputation and this is by no means me calling anybody into dispute but i was just interested in how long people have had to wait its coming from within Europe to the UK. I guess i&#039;m just feeling a bit sketchy about it being seized, lost into someone&#039;s back pocket i can deal with but customs fuck no and it will be game over for this address i am using cause surely it will be flagged. Anyway anyone&#039;s thoughts and feelings about this would be great.<br />

				i suppose its easy when your new to everything to get sketched out i will wait to the end of the week then send a msg over to the vendor, thing is i don&#039;t want a refund cause i don&#039;t want it against my stats i&#039;m just gonna put it down to one of those things i guess.
