				&nbsp;***&nbsp; WELCOME TO THE DMT REAL(M) -&nbsp; MACHINE ELVES***<br /><br />Yes, we have finally &quot;broken through&quot; to Sheep Marketplace.<br /><br />Were still rolling strong on the sheep and getting great feedback - Profile Here<br /><br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/66bad21848c2b3fdace837f5e9861363 <br /><br />Everyone should have a purpose; ours is making and selling NN-DMT, in it&#039;s purest freebase form.<br /><br />Although new to Sheep Marketplace, we have many years experience in creating the strongest and most<br />potent &quot;breakthrough substance&quot; you will find anywhere.<br /><br />As Terrence once mused....<br /><br />&quot;There are these things, which I call &quot;self transforming MACHINE ELVES,&quot; I also call them self-dribbling<br />basketballs. They are, but they are none of these things. I mean you have to understand: these are metaphors in the&nbsp; &nbsp; truest sense.&nbsp; I name them &#039;Tykes&#039; because tyke is a word that means to me a small child, ... and when you burst into&nbsp; the DMT space this is the Aeon - it&#039;s a child, and it&#039;s at play with colored balls, and I am in eternity, apparently,&nbsp; in the presence of this thing. ”<br /><br />—Terence McKenna, &quot;Time and Mind&quot;<br /><br />Please message us if you are in any way dis-satisfied with any part of our service, We strive to ensure a 5/5 service&nbsp; &nbsp; to all customers.<br /><br />GREAT DESCRIPTION OF DMT &amp; ITS EFFECTS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adDRsqEj4PU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m48s<br /><br />**********************************************************************************<br /><br />PRODUCT - We specialize and ONLY sell DMT.<br /><br />No Gimmics, No Razzmataz<br /><br />Our DMT is extracted from high quality Mimosa Hostilis organically grown in Brazil and Mexico.<br />We use STB Method, which has been improved upon by experimenting with temperature (Ice cooling throughout the various stages) along with other factors.<br /><br />We don&#039;t recrystallize final product as many people prefer this way. However the quality is EXTREMELY GOOD, mostly because of our patience, understanding chemistry and over 5 years of practice Even experience users are often impressed by it&#039;s quality.<br /><br />Currently there are: 0.25g ,0.5g and 1.0g listings available.<br /><br />We don&#039;t do any free samples or smaller quantities.<br /><br />We will offer small discounts for people buying 3 or more products at once.<br />Please contact us first to discuss the discount rate.<br /><br />The maximum order we can dispatch at once is 5g.<br /><br />Please message us if you are in any way dis-satisfied with any part of our service, We strive to ensure a 5/5 service to all customers.<br /><br />##################################################################################################<br />RECENT REVIEWS from SR and SHEEP&nbsp; (Buyer Names Removed):<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;great, perfect and on time as always<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Fast and Professional.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;This was brilliant, sellers communication was excellent informing me when my order was dispatched and the delivery time which was fantastic. Stealth was above par haha. Product looks great, have not tested but assured its the real deal thanks again!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Amazing!!! ego death, Machine elves I experienced them or me? there like a mirror of self arrrgh words fail.........Smooth the come up of this product Smoooooooth gradual like you melt away, nice taste too. Twice ive hit on this and broke through.. life will never be the same again and i love it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />10/10 beautiful stealth - My No.1<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;received order quickly, excellent stealth, great comms, get a cool vibe from this vendor, not tried product yet<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;fantastic seller, received the very next day.. this is my 2nd time ordering dmt from this guy, and will be back again<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Absolutely gobsmacked!! Brilliant stealth, delivery, price and product. This is my 2nd order (500mg this time) from the Machine Elves and was generously overweight :-))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I will be taking this later tonight with some buddies that I am introducing to DMT ;-))<br />If they get even half of the ride I had last time, expect far more orders in the very near future!!<br /><br />10/5 on everything, especially quality and the communication throughout. Cheers!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;fantastic, quick delivery, havent used the product yet but will update once i have<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Good stuff. Weight is bang on / slightly over. I didn&#039;t break through but I was FUCKED UP at the time (benzos) and I came really close. I&#039;m going to do it properly next time (on a weekend, no intoxicants before, eating right, brief meditation) and I&#039;m almost positive that 50mg will make me see the machine elves.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Basically... this vendor is selling the good stuff. I&#039;m going to buy more as soon as I can get hold of some more BTC. The price is great too (the best in the UK even, based on the quality?)&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re on the fence - don&#039;t be. Just do it.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Really helpful vendors, took the time to answer a number of questions I had.<br />Next day delivery and no worries on stealth etc!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Great fast and stealth delivery. Haven&#039;t tried the product yet (looks good though), but their profile and the nice correspondence I had with the vendor, including some good tips on how the use the product, show a very honest attitude to what they sell. Recommended!<br />unrated&nbsp; &nbsp;no review<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp;Great quality , fast delivery and excellent stealth what else can you ask.<br />Tried just small 15mg dose and had me tripping balls so its strong stuff.If you like to trip but dont like all the long acid trippy types of drugs you will like DMT. Its fast acting and has a short but very very potent experience.<br /><br />Contact with vendor was great. Item came the next day, great stealth &amp; top quality product! Thank you MachineElves :)<br /><br />Real deal. I took my chances, and ordered at 7am before my work and got it the next morning first class. Discreet packaging. Thanks&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />10/10! Vendor communication top notch and packaging genius. Will be back!<br />##################################################################################################<br />PACKAGING<br /><br />Every order is carefully weighted (always over), packed in sealed small plastic bag, smell proofed and then dispatched in a plain envelope with printed details.<br /><br />##################################################################################################<br />SHIPPING<br /><br />We try to dispatch orders same day (if ordered before 2pm) or next morning, but sometimes it can take up to 48h hours.<br />In case of any unusual delay we will contact you straight away and offer a full refund or order cancellation.<br /><br />In general we ship within EU, but may consider shipping to other places, please contact us first, so we can discuss. No USA, sorry.<br /><br />We will ship to Scandinavian countries, Italy, Spain, Germany, France and other slightly more risky places in Europe.<br /><br />We don&#039;t require FE (even from first-time buyers), this way it&#039;s safer for you and in case of any problems it&#039;s usually easier to resolve.<br /><br />We only ask people to FE with unusually high refund rate, or if you want us to send to high risk countries.<br /><br />PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR ADDRESS IS 100% CORRECT.<br />IF YOU NEED EXTRA SECURITY - ALSO PLEASE ENCRYPT IT or use https://privnote.com/<br />##################################################################################################<br />REFUNDS<br /><br />If your order doesn&#039;t arrive we will refund 50% of it&#039;s total price, but only to people with at least 5 completed transactions and no previous refunds.<br /><br />Alternatively we can reship your order free of charge (only once) - it&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />If you have less than 5 completed transactions and/or some previous refunds please buy at your own risk (We can&#039;t offer any refund in case your parcel goes missing).<br />##################################################################################################<br />PAYMENT<br />We only accept Bitcoins.<br />Our listings are hedged and prices are originally in GBP, so value in Bitcoins will vary as Bitcoin price fluctuates.<br /><br />##################################################################################################

				Thanks Enlightened and also you SM! (esp. for your &quot;special order last night&nbsp; ;))<br /><br />The SHEEP Marketplace is possibly not the best choice of name, but it really does work well and as far as we can see it&#039;s as safe as you can expect.<br /><br />***JUST DON&#039;T SEND ADDRESSES IN PLAIN TEXT***<br /><br />PGP if possible, but at the very least use https://privnote.com/<br /><br />PS - Last batch all cleared, new batch ready later today - SO PLACE YOUR ORDERS NOW TO GET FOR THE WEEKEND&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/account/profile/66bad21848c2b3fdace837f5e9861363<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES
