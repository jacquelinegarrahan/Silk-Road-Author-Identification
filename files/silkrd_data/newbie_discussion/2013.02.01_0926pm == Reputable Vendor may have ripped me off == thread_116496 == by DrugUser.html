				Hello I have been a member for six months and have 20 transactions which went flawlessly. Then I ordered one g of some coca cola from a reputable vendor, which was marked in transit on monday morning. It is now Friday and I have received nothing. I sent the Vendor a message but no response yet. I suspect that I am being ripped off because all of the feedback for this vendor says that shipping is really fast. I wanted to post to let you all know to be wary of said vendor except I wont name until Im sure I have been ripped off. And if the package arrives I will let you know.

				You should send the vendor a message on SR before posting about it here. He may have more info for you about the package.

				â‡§ agreed. It may just be lost in the post. If they are a reputable vendor, they will do all they can to help.<br /><br />They won&#039;t look favorably on starting a scam-warning post before doing all you can to resolve.

				OP you need to brush up on your forum etiquette, 4 days, wait at least 2 weeks, and then allow for anything, your not ordering from amazon! He could of been arrested, robbed, your parcel could be lost/stolen. Try to resolve before you panic, he wont like you flaming him after 4 days mate, don&#039;t panic it will come by saturday bet you, then you will be :-[ Don&#039;t be hasty!

				You are right NorthernStar. I panicked. Here&#039;s to hoping it arrives tomorrow. I originally got worried because right after I ordered he posted on his page that since he no longer could track packages if one didnt make it he would not issue a return.

				I just went through the same thing and messaged the vendor around day 6-7. It&#039;s a nice reminder for vendor in case your order was not shipped yet for some reason. Have patience, sometimes USPS does some weird things as well. If you do find out the vendor was sitting on your order, simply add that to your review feedback. Just mentioning it in feedback is enough and if everything else is great 5/5. If it happens again due to vendor just find another.

				It&#039;s always a good idea to relax and wait it out before worrying. Give it some more time, and communicate with the vendor.

				It&#039;s easy to panic considering your money is on the line and there&#039;s anxiety building while waiting for the product. An easy solution for the anxiety of waiting for the product is to always keep some on hand, lol. But yeah, the vendors are not going to appreciate you opening the thread so quickly and not discussing it with them first. Every vendor I messaged has gotten back to me fairly quickly. Always message the vendor first. They are likely to help you work out a solution.

				As a vendor with over 300 transactions myself, let me advise you to take a few deep breaths. You say your vendor has a good rep. Accepting that as fact, it&#039;s unlikely (but not impossible that) s/he would deliberately rip you off. S/he may not be answering due to a sudden personal problem that barely allow time to get orders processed every day. Have you checked the vendor&#039;s profile page? For some of us popular vendors who don&#039;t frequent the forums very often, and participate even less often (there are only so many hours in a day) the new blanket 50 post rule etc. has cut us off from the forum boards buyers have created to connect us to you folks in an more informal way. So the only way we have left to communicate with you buyers is through our profile. We certainly can&#039;t PM everyone, even if we had a list, and we don&#039;t. (SR doesn&#039;t provide us one, and keeping that data local is a security risk.)<br /><br />Where shipping is concerned: Take a look at the &quot;Shipping&quot; forum board and you&#039;ll see a thread about how much longer the Post Office is taking to deliver packages since the holidays. Why? Nobody knows for sure. What I can say is that my buyers are experiencing this themselves. Last week we had a Priority package take 11 days to arrive at the buyer&#039;s house. Just the other day we had a buyer post feedback that it took 7 days for their order to arrive! Our own experience: We had an Express package from a SR vendor we use regularly take 5 bloody days to arrive. It religiously takes that vendor&#039;s PRIORITY shipment&#039;s 3 days to arrive! <br /><br />So how about a drink, and a bit more patience. Hopefully things will turn out right in the end.<br />

				Thanks Emerald Triangle. The fact that it was sent priority is what has me worried. Usually that takes 2-3 days and now Im on day five since it was marked in transit but perhaps you are right maybe it just taking a long time. Doing my best to stay calm. Hoping it shows up any day now.

				Just wanted to let you all know that my package arrived finally after about 6 days and it was not vendors fault it was USPS that took forever. I will be starting a new thread to celebrate the vendor. Thanks everyone for your input.

				I have worries about my 2 orders, which were supposedly shipped 13 days ago from EU to EU another from Germany and the other from Netherlands. Our countrys customs say 90% of shipments go through, I have a 40% success rate at this point, 2 came, and 3 are still to come, 1 has only took 4 days, so that might easily come, but i&#039;m still worried. Not least because for 2 of the 3 I had to Fe cause i&#039;m new.<br /><br />Really hoping they make it, will update my situation.

				It&#039;s possible that you got ripped off, of course. But look at it this way:<br /><br />I&#039;m a vendor and you buy a product from me for $50. <br /><br />I keep the $50, and never send you the product. <br /><br />You then never order from me again...<br /><br />Or!<br /><br />I send you the product, you are happy with it and continue to order products. <br /><br />It&#039;s not in a sellers best interest to scam you on here, especially for small orders. <br /><br />Like another user said, this isn&#039;t Amazon. We&#039;re sending illegal drugs through the postal system. There will be times when this doesn&#039;t work. <br /><br />Hold out and see what happens.
