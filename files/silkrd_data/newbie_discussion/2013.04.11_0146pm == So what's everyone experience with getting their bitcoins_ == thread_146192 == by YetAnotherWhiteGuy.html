				I rather not spam my way to 50 post, then get let loose in public and still be a bit uneducated with how everything works, so I thought I&#039;d contribute something a bit more than spam. With all the bitcoin madness the past few days, it&#039;s only understandable that there&#039;s going to be an influx of new people, and with that, a whole bunch of ignorance. I&#039;ve seen the question come up a few times here about how best to get bitcoins, so here we go. Maybe I&#039;ll help someone out, and get closer to 50 in the process. <br /><br />MtGox https://mtgox.com/<br />No personal experience, but to open an account they want a JPG of your photo ID &amp; a copy of a bill with your address. I avoided them for this - and the fact they have been under heavy volume and unreliable for a few days. They do have the largest volume from what I understand. <br />edit in - they are halting transactions when under heavy load starting today. <br /><br />Bitinstant&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />I used bitinstant a couple days ago was &quot;ok&quot;. For those with access to stores with Moneygram (CVS, Walmart, Albertsons), you walk into their store and fill out a form or talk on the red phone, providing personal information and whatnot, and it arrives at bitinstant, they buy the coins right then and there, and send it either to your MtGox account or Bitcoin Address. They used to be able to send the bitcoins to your email via coinapult, however it seems the high-volume made them get rid of this option. <br /><br />BitFloor&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitfloor.com/<br />The second one I used, and I liked them. For those in the US, all you need is a local Bank of America branch, and no - you don&#039;t need an account. Create your account, create a deposit slip for cash. You walk into the bank, fill out a generic deposit slip with the information provided, do NOT provide a driver license or anything, and you walk out. Bitfloor will put the money in your account after verifying funds, and you can buy the bitcoins on the open market when you are ready. You can also sell the bitcoins for money if you like, however to get the money out by ACH deposit you&#039;ll have to verify bank information. I plan on buying on Silkroad, so this isn&#039;t a problem for me. <br /><br />Some other options, which I didn&#039;t try yet : <br /><br />https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I read they take funds from bank accounts, which I stepped away from. <br /><br />https://bitcoin-24.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; &nbsp; hooks you up with people locally if you&#039;re really low on options. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I commend your integrity with regards to post count.<br /><br />I recently bought BTC in the UK using a combination of TransferWise &amp; BitStamp. <br />The whole process was drawn out over 48 hours, but BitStamp (or TW) made a big mistake - they ended up doubling my money! I transferred (not actual amount) $100 from TransferWise into BitStamp, and my BitStamp balance was $200. Win!!!

				IF you&#039;re planning on buying Bitcoin for investment purposes, then I would recommend using Mt.Gox.&nbsp; If you are looking to buy &lt;1000, or you are looking to only use them on the Road, then there are plenty of trusted vendors on the Road that will trade cash for BTC, which is by far the easiest, fastest, and most anonymous way to acquire them that i have found.&nbsp;

				Great post! I&#039;ve been asking the questions you just answered! The one thing I was worried about was when I signed up with bitfloor, they did say something about showing id. So, just a hypothetical question, do you have to use your actual name setting up say account with bitfloor? Or does it matter? Say someone had an anon email and used that? <br /><br />Thanks again!

				I have used bit floor a total of 4 times and each transaction is as smooth as transfering money between axcounts. The deposit goes into my bitfloor account the second I leave the bank. Trading the usd for btc is as easy as buying an ebook and it takes anywhere from 15-45 minutes for the money to reach sr. It is definitely worth the one time 3 percent you are charged during the initial deposit. As long as this sit works I will continue to use it. I do have one question. Many boa employees have recommended setting up a bill pay so I can send the funds to bit floor usig my boa app. I was wondering if this would still work even though local till requires a cash deposit. My guess is no.

				I did the same as kyotosong and used sugar mama. this was when money was going up last week, watched my 336 go up to 357 lol, I was so amazed in economics. anyway, it took over 4 days but when I sent a pm asking if everything was sent right I got a reply quickly saying it was priority in que, and within a few hours I had money inthe bank. it worked biput did take a while to process, I&#039;d be interested in finding someone who is faster with money packs or a better way. thanks :-)

				So, I have my bc&#039;s almost ready on bitfloor. I used the cap1 p2p process. I&#039;m thinking its probably not 100% anon, but I figured I would drop it thru bitfog and that should keep my hands clean. Anyway, I did it about an hour ago and will let you all know when it hit. <br /><br />And i&#039;m also trying to get to 50 posts, so I keep on keeping on!
