				Use your own name/address, but don&#039;t sign for anything and plead ignorance if confronted with the package (ie. &quot;i didn&#039;t order anything&quot;). Now I know some sellers require you to sign for the package upon arrival, so read the shipping info carefully or contact the seller to confirm if that is the case. In my country, if the customs seize the package they will call you in and open it with you present, so if that were to happen, I would not go and just chalk it up as a loss. But with a letter-sized, properly stealth package, that&#039;s unlikely to happen.

				pgp is just one more layer of security. You might as well use it because once you have it set up it&#039;s extremely simple.

				IT is perfectly safe just putting in your address without the use of PGP. Silkroad is very secure and as soon as rhe vendor clicks |&quot;in transit&quot; your address is deleted of SR forever.&nbsp; Some people just like to be extra safe and use PGP so they are 100% positive only the seller could have seen the address

				You should probably use PGP just in case, I mean it is not hard at all and it makes you safer. It is a precaution but use it just in case

				As a newbie to the site, I would say take as much precaution as you can and use PGP. Never used it before, but I&#039;ve built plenty of computers and have a good learning curve, so it shouldn&#039;t be too difficult to grasp once I start using it. I mean, it can&#039;t hurt.

				ALWAYS send your address encrypted for your own safety. It may take 20 mins to 2 hours to learn pgp but once you learn how to use it encrypting information takes literally seconds so it&#039;s not a big deal at all. Why would you want your name and address stored on the SR servers if they didn&#039;t have to be? Just eat some pralines and cream icecream while you&#039;re watching a pgp tutorial and you&#039;ll be golden.

				If you actually have another address besides your home address that you can rely on to receive mail at -- specifically a P.O. box -- than I suppose it would be best to use the address that isn&#039;t your home address (although it&#039;s doubtful it will actually make any real difference at all). However, most people don&#039;t have a viable alternative to receiving mail at their home address.<br /><br />The protection that encrypting your address using PGP offers you is that, when encrypted, you&#039;re ensuring that ONLY the seller who you&#039;re ordering from would ever be able to access such personal information. This could potentially make all the difference in the world.

				Use PGP, Use a real address with the name of a real person who lives there. You want your money to get lost? Looks more suspicious if you are mailing to someone who doesn&#039;t live there.

				Using your real address is safe provided you also use PGP. If silk road is compromised the messages that buyers send to vendors via the website will become visible to the authorities. It is only a matter of time before silk road becomes compromised and when that happens the authorities will go after the big buyers and sellers and small customers won&#039;t be immediately affected. However, the authorities will likely take all the names and addresses of the small buyers and throw them into various government databases that will get you all sorts of special treatment by TSA, local cops, etc. Anyone using PGP won&#039;t have to worry about this.
