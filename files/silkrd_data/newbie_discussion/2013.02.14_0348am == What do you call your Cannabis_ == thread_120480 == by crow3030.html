				I am curious to know what other people out there call Cannabis.&nbsp; For me, it is mainly:<br /><br />Bud<br />Pot<br />Weed<br /><br />I know there are way more terms out there.&nbsp; So what do you call it?

				I prefer to call it by the strain name if known, but obviously that&#039;s not always possible. So if its something good I tend to call it dank. And in general if Im just discussing it, I&#039;ll call it herb.

				There is a cool russian word for that, &quot;дудка&quot;. <br />Doodka. Based on verb &#039;дуть&#039;, ie &#039;to blow&#039;. It has nothing about the cocaine though:)<br />Good russian punk song about doodka: http://music.yandex.ru/#!/track/110044/album/10406 (CLEARNET!)

				In English I call it cannabis or weed. But over here in Spain people call it &#039;hierba&#039;, which literally means &#039;herb&#039;, and &#039;verde&#039; which means &#039;green&#039; :p <br />I wonder how it varies with other languages.

				Weed when I&#039;m being blatant, otherwise I say bud or nug.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been throwing around the word nuggetry, but no one has picked up on it. Lmao.<br /><br />Edit: It&#039;s supposed to be pronounced nugget-tree... originally I thought that would be nuggetry, but I think I fucked up. What&#039;s a more accurate spelling? Damn, I&#039;m pretty high.

I saw that on a vendor&#039;s profile describing his bud, decided to buy from him and I&#039;ve been using that term for a while. Started noticing it more and more lately, in rap especially.<br /><br />Last heard loud in Fabolous&#039; verse in Soft on Juelz Santana&#039;s latest mixtape.<br />&quot;Got a O-Z of that loudmouth&quot;
