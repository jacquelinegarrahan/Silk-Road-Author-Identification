				Hey guys,<br /><br />I am going to my first festival at the end of the month (Electric Forest!) and I was wondering if I could get some advice on what drugs I should take and the safety of taking them. I definitely want to candyflip on day 4 because the schedule is so perfect that day.<br />But idk what to take the first three days.<br />I was thinking maybe:<br />Day 1: MDMA<br />Day 2: LSD (or something else)<br />Day 3: Some other psychedelic that has low cross tolerance, or maybe just alcohol.<br />Day 4: LSD + MDMA<br /><br />thanks!

				If you&#039;re going to be taking MDMA two night within the four days I&#039;d suggest thinking about spending day 3 sober (except weed and maybe a couple drinks) to recover for day 4. I&#039;d also recommend watching your dosage/redose rate on night 1. Between the late nights, sleeping outdoors, and a good comedown waking up at a festival can be hell, and you don&#039;t want to ruin day 2. Basically just pace yourself and remember to eat and stay hydrated. I just did a 3 day recently and made the mistake of going too hard too early on night 1 and ended up passing out early and ruing a lot of day 2. Its a marathon not a sprint.

				just play it by ear. it&#039;s no fun being burnt out in a hot and humid environment. also that lsd isn&#039;t going to pack the same punch on day four if you already took it on day 2.

				Okay how about taking MDA on Day 1. Does that have any cross tolerance?<br />And maybe a tryptamine + weed on Day 2?
