				If you are vending here and didn&#039;t think this far ahead then to be honest you shouldn&#039;t be asking yourself &quot;How do I launder money&quot; it should be more like &quot;What the fuck am I doing with my life?&quot; or &quot;Was I born being a dumb-ass with no common sense or did I just work really hard at it?&quot; or even better than that &quot;Can I count to potato?&quot;. <br /><br />Have a nice day. :)

				You can just leave it in your pants pocket and wait until you pull the pants out of the drier to notice there was money in them. Wait what was the question? <br />Lolol, I couldn&#039;t resist.

				People, stop blowing up the poor dude...we are on a forum so we can learn from one another, I do understand this is touchy subject for a lot of people who are making money, but once upon a time you started somewhere, somewhat asked a question or two to someone more knowledgeable then yourself at the time. <br /><br />Pal, you can launder money in more ways then you can imagine, the whole point of laundering is to make cash accountable. However all that work is useless if your caught with smallest amounts of product or any illegal wrong doing for that matter.<br /><br />Money laundering is not something that can be done over night, over weeks or months, its an art which on very few can perfect over years of trial and error with successful end results. <br /><br />Ultimately the point of money laundering is to eventually make it accountable but most importantly keep it out of reach of most jurisdictions who would wanna tap into it :(<br /><br />It is too much to rant on here, but if you wanna PM me, I can at least point you in the direction where to start. <br /><br />Must advise though, it can be an expensive process to start off with and requires a great deal of time to learn the strategies and methods involved. I hope I have answered your question partially at the very least.<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />
