				I am fairly new to the forums but not to the road. Have amazing stats and been going almost 2 years. Beware buying anything from &quot;The Top Shelf&quot;. His prices for what he&#039;s offering are too good to be true and he forces fe. That&#039;s screaming a scam. <br /><br />I sent him a polite message and he responded back being a complete dick and telling me he didn&#039;t give a shit if I had 100 purchases, fe is fe.<br /><br />Has anyone actually received anything from this person?

				All his feedback I saw was &quot;FE&quot;. He&#039;s claiming he has dank weed for 600/QP fe only lol.<br /><br />Never had a vendor be so rude through a message. Looks like a fairly new account from what I remembered, just wanted to warn those here new to the game

				Not seeing anything about him forcing FE.. in fact his profile clearly states he works in hedged escrow and has a 99.2% rating.<br /><br />Ah.. I see the listing you&#039;re referring to now. Maybe he needs the cash quick and he trying to unload product, who knows. You know what they say about things being too good to be true.<br />

				Yeah he only forces fe on the one &quot;too good to be true&quot; listing. Just getting a bad bad vibe from his coms and the price/feel/etc.<br /><br />I would be happy with a higher price to cover his hedge fee if he&#039;s worried about coins

				Sorry to break it to you, but you got screwed. I was tempted by his offerings the other day, but then I took a look at the thread that he or she had linked in his or her vendor profile. It quickly became clear that I should take my BTC elsewhere. Never FE. Not even once.

				It doesnt look good really. I feel sorry for anyone who has put any money into his account, its a nightmare, having to wait for ages just to find out if you deffo have been scammed. I dont blame people tho, some times you just dont think because of using it all the time with genuine vendors you start to trust people.<br /><br />People are right tho, staying in escrow is the only form of protection, you are reducing risk which is what you want to do if you want to save money and not get scammed.<br />

				He told me my gram was traced to my post office on Saturday and that it would be delivered on Monday. Well today is Monday and I got another of my packages from someone else (an OZ) but not my gram from him. So, he either lied through his fucking teeth or they seized the gram and sent my OZ which is unlikely as fuck. Why does he have no listings did they ban him? Whats going on?

				He scammed me for a 100$ moneypak. Bought moneypak to BTC from him Saturday, he informed me of a 48 hour processing time and here we are on monday, vendor page no where to be found and the scam is in full motion. It&#039;s not the end of the world but damn it still kind of hurts. My money is kind of tight at the moment and I was hoping to make a few extra bucks if bitcoin price rises by the time my rent is due. With bitcopia and bitflor&#039;s bank account closed I&#039;m at a lost at how to buy quick anonymous bitcoins. I&#039;ve heard good things about JumboMonkeyBiscuit but on his page it says he&#039;s only been a vendor for a month. Any of you guys can help me out? Where can I get quick annoymous bitcoins now a days and should I give JumboMonkeyBiscuit a try after just getting moneypak scammed by Top Shelf?

				Yep, I also FE&#039;d for a 785 QP...He stated that it&#039;s expected to arrive tomorrow when I asked on Friday to check the DCN since I got paranoid after reading forum posts about him setting up a scam.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad Libertas posted here with info about his account being suspended. That&#039;s relieves the notion of mine that told me he already bailed out with the intention of taking the loot and running.<br /><br />Now, once his account gets reinstated, is it possible to force him to give all our loot back if the packages never show? Considering he already told plenty of folks that it was in the post office and should be here TODAY, I assume that it&#039;s a definite scam that just happened. But, I think it&#039;s important to stay calm and give him the benefit of the doubt, considering this is the first time in 6 months of him being a Vendor that anyone has accused him of scamming. Something about the timing seems off, though. Why is he scamming RIGHT as people begin to accuse him of being a scammer? Oh wait, I remember, because it links with him being banned from Atlantis for selling Moneypack---&gt;BTC.<br /><br />Still, what can we do now besides wait?<br />-d4bz0nd4bz

				Yeah this really sucks. I&#039;ll never again trust anyone I don&#039;t know very well to be a decent human being. But hey, maybe our economy will implode soon and all of the USD he converts those BTC to will be shit worthless. I hope to have as much weed as possible when that happens =p I have little to no expectations of getting any money back but hey, maybe SR will come through for us some how.

				Baboon, my theory is that our packages are late because of Mothers day. It&#039;s possible that the DCN did say today, which is why he told many people it would be here today, but it didn&#039;t take into account all the traffic from Mothers day packages/gifts/letters being sent. <br /><br />He told me MAYBE Monday, but definitely Tuesday TBH, so I still have a day before I can admit to being duped. <br /><br />Again, this is just a theory...But I still have faith, considering he&#039;s been doing this whole FE thing for months now and no one has accused him of scamming until recently.<br /><br />Again, why would he tell me Tuesday and not Monday if he was scamming? Seems a bit too elaborate. Even though, ya can&#039;t discredit the man for trying to go extra lengths to make himself seem credible if he really wanted to keep the illusion going for as long as possible. Lol, right now I&#039;m pretty much trying to figure this out so I&#039;m taking everything into account.<br /><br />

				I was very close to buying from this guy, he seemed very legit and professional. To see it on the front page made it seem even more legit. FE didn&#039;t fly with me so I went with NCK(very good vendor btw). <br /><br />My condolences go out to the many buyers who FE&#039;d with Top Shelf. I&#039;ve seen numerous amount of people stating they finalized early. It is just a shame.&nbsp; :-\ <br />

				Dude he told me it was at my post office on Saturday so there is no reason it shouldn&#039;t have been here today since I got my OZ I ordered from someone else. He lied and we are fucked. Mother&#039;s Day had nothing to do with this.

				Yeah he told me on saturday that it was sitting in the post office. I even asked my mailman if I had a package and he said no. The dudes account is already gone, when you click on him it only lets you send message and the number next to his name is gone.

				His account has been suspended due to an investigation of his behavior, according to forum moderator &quot;Libertas.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s why there is no number and after clicking on his name it brings us to messages.<br /><br />Other than that, I dunno what to say.

If it is found that he has not scammed anyone, his privileges will be reinstated, though that seems unlikely at this stage. Regardless, anyone that has FE&#039;d will not be seeing their money again. An expensive lesson to learn, but an essential one. Do not leave the protection of the escrow system.<br /><br />Libertas

				I FE&#039;d on a Top Shelf QP as well, 800 gone for me. I put the whole Mother&#039;s Day thing in my head as well, but I was also told that the DCN said it was at the Post Office on Saturday and should be here today. I want to keep thinking that it will be here tomorrow, but I don&#039;t know that I have any faith left in this coming through. I couldn&#039;t afford this loss either, Baboon, but we only have ourselves to blame. Just take it to heart and never leave the safety of Escrow. This loss screws the pooch for me.<br /><br />Thanks.

				His prices and product weren&#039;t really attractive to me compared to other vendors. It sucks to hear he turned to be a scammer and that some of you guys got fucked on huge orders..<br /><br />I have my dudes to buy weed from on here, but as much as I trust them they will come thru...when it comes to bitcoin or drugs, you can&#039;t trust anybody but yourself.

There are plenty of reputable vendors that accept new buyers and do not require FE. Once you leave the protection of the escrow system, there is nothing that Silk Road can do to help in the event that something goes wrong. Do your research about vendors on the forums, ensure you learn how to use PGP, maybe send them a message or two inquiring about their &#039;new buyer policies&#039; (if it&#039;s not already stated on their profile page), and when you feel comfortable enough go ahead and place an order. But do NOT leave the safety of the escrow system until you have your order in your hands and are 100% satisfied with it! :)<br /><br />Libertas
