Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of this community. However, there is no use in having a forum that we cannot conduct open discussion in as a result of mass spamming, thus a 50 post restriction was put in place to ensure that the main boards remain as spam-free as possible.<br /><br />The captcha was put in place to defeat bots employed by the spammers to plaster spam in as many places as they could with no effort.<br /><br />Once you reach 50 posts you will be free to engage in any discussion that interests you - as freely and openly as you wish - in any forum.<br /><br />Libertas

				there is a logical reason for making a 50 post limit for newbies. people who want to just spam the forum will show their colours in here. then they are batted out, and the rest of us honest SR forum users are subjected to less spam and trolling and scamming.<br /><br />i am doing just fine, already at 34 or so after 4 hours of posting, and almost every post i&#039;ve made is actually relevant to the topic. i&#039;ll have my full stripes in an hour or two. <br /><br />if you can&#039;t hack that, then you might consider that your lack of commitment indicates you might have malicious intent. and in that case, fuck your trolling ass. otherwise. carry on. <br /><br />right now there is plenty of things to talk about, for one, the fact that almost nobody can get on SR.

				When the newbie board becomes full of people spamming to 50 it defeats the point.. <br /><br />*Better to have mods who can issue 12-24hour bans on anyone who posts spam or if mods are lacking in numbers then anyone with x- amount of karma to post ratio should be able to time limit ban spammers until a mod can verify.&nbsp; <br /><br />This 50 post limit isn&#039;t stopping anything, its easy enough to cheat your way there. You often see bitcoin scammers getting to 50 in a matter of hours then covering the forum in Buy bitcoins for cash bs etc.. <br /><br />A new system is needed. Im being a good boy, almost at 50 with no spamming or bullshit but I cant join in many worth while discussions so its pretty boring.

				Okay no locking is good. Thanks <br />Now when I joined a year ago this was not the case. Why the sudden change. Besides all e bitcoins spam I would see and not allot to be honest as I STAYED put in the one thread basically could u not look at those remaking their account and a one time extension of the olive branch open the account to a bit of freedom. Hell just do some searching. Won&#039;t take but a Few moments to see I was a very respected member of this community. I have 14 total posts. So at this rate I am looking at over 2 weeks to maybe get to 50 before I can get back to my thread and the communi I belong with. <br /><br />If I spam bane me forever I don&#039;t care cause I don&#039;t spam I treat this place with respect 50+ karma and less than 20 neg<br /><br />Only in one thread.

The &quot;btkoin/bitswing&quot; spammers used to plaster the other forums on a regular basis - as you said, you stuck mostly to the one thread so perhaps weren&#039;t exposed to the full extent of the spam, but it was making discussion in the other forums impossible as threads were being knocked back a number of pages every time it happened.<br /><br />Regarding old users opening new accounts, all new accounts must be treated equally. You can still view any thread on the forum without first reaching 50 posts, and actually hitting that limit can be done in less than an hour or two when contributing to legitimate discussion in the Newbie forum.<br /><br />The only possible exceptions to the rule are when a vendor registers an account and needs to be able to post elsewhere in order to advertise their products, but even then that very rarely occurs. By the time an admin even gets the chance to view the request made by a moderator the member in question will usually already have 50+ posts.<br /><br />Libertas

				I definitely agree with the 50 post rule to avoid spam, but I think it is a bit defeated with several threads specifically called spam threads just to get your post number up :p

Trust me, I know how frustrating it is - I had to go through captcha hell when I started this new moderator account. It&#039;s almost worth it though for the relief you feel once it&#039;s gone! :P<br /><br />As far as paying for the ban to be removed, that would be impossible as it would create a system of inequality whereby those that can afford it can sidestep the 50 post rule, but those that cannot afford it will have to post to 50. That system is already in place on a global scale in society and it is not something that we would wish to replicate here.<br /><br />Libertas

				When I fist registered there was no post restriction for the general forum.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve just attempted to make a legitimate post and even though I&#039;ve been a member for almost a year I find myself restricted by this half arsed spam fix.<br /><br />The fact that I&#039;ve been a member for so long with a lower post count thats not made up of 50 bullshit posts should grant me access to all of the forum as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />conclusion?
