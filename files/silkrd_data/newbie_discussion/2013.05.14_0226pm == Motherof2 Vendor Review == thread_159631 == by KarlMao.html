				Ive had the pleasure of sampling Motherof2&#039;s two new strains: Cherry Pie and Purple diesel.&nbsp; They arrived in multiple stealthy sealed vacuum packs, but when I cut open the bags, my entire house started smelling like the bud.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cherry Pie:&nbsp; Has a very pungent and slightly minty scent.&nbsp; These are some of the frostiest nugs I have ever seen.&nbsp; While breaking a nug apart, my fingers became sticky immediately.&nbsp; A squeeze test noted great density and also a hard spongy rebound, definitely AAA grade. There is just a thick layer of trichromes covering every corner of every bud.&nbsp; Smoking is great, it burns slowly and nicely.&nbsp; However, vaporizing it was perhaps way more efficient, as I got knocked out in a couple of vape hits!!&nbsp; Definitely a great bud.<br /><br />Purple diesel: This bud is actually purple! It smells very fruity and strong.&nbsp; The nugs were so frosty they were almost hard to break apart.&nbsp; A couple of bong hits and vape hits also put me at a very good buzz.&nbsp; I got a bud the size of a tic tac box, thick and dense.<br /><br />Definitely these two strains are some of the best bud I have ever had.&nbsp; If you want something slightly stronger, definitely go for Cherry Pie.&nbsp; However, the purple diesel is more fruity tasting and overall a more sativa buzz.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, Motherof2&#039;s customer service is top notch.&nbsp; My first order did not go as well as I hoped but she made it up in a very professional manner.&nbsp; Thanks!
