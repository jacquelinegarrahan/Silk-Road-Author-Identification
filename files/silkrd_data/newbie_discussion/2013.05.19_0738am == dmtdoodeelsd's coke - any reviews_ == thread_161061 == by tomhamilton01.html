				Has anyone had any experience with dmtdoodeelsd&#039;s coke? A lot of the feedback comments are just FE and his gear is pretty expensive so has anyone had any experience with it / know what the quality is like?<br /><br />Cheers.

				Not had his coke, but I&#039;ve had his mdma and that was lovely. <br /><br />Nice guy too. <br />Decent communication and went the extra mile to get what I needed. - overweight too. Which was nice.

				Cheers for the reply, will update once I have tried it. I looked at his MDMA but went for subtickle in the end - his prices are extremely competitive and the reviews look pretty good. Yet to try though. I think I&#039;ll head for JOR next - the forums seem to be going mad with his latest batch.

				I don&#039;t mean to derail your thread, but how good is subtickle&#039;s MDMA and what&#039;s his stealth like? Symbiosis is my regular guy (great stuff, great price, pretty good stealth) but subtickle looks very cheap in bulk, I&#039;ve been thinking about getting a load for festival season.<br /><br />To stay on topic a bit I&#039;ll say that I researched dmtdoodeelsd&#039;s coke ages ago and was tempted by the excellent reviews, but ended up going with lloydsbrothers instead. So much choice, too little time and money to try everyone!

				quixotist - Not derailing the thread - happy to give my opinion on subtickle. I have bought from symbiosis several times and have been really impressed with his mdma, but was too tempted by subtickle&#039;s prices as you rightly said. I am yet to try the product as I am saving it for June when I have finished my exams but his stealth was superb - I bought the 14g listing and it was up there with the best stealth i have seen. I don&#039;t know what it would be like for larger amounts but for what I got I was seriously impressed. And a friend of mine recommended him to me saying the product itself was the best he&#039;s tried so am very excited to have a try. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also bought coke from lloydsbrothers but again yet to try - how did you rate his product?

				Lloydsbrothers has good coke, far better than I can get here but it&#039;s been a while since I had any off him. The last lot I had was powerful and arrived dry as a bone. Hygroscopic as fuck too, left out overnight it soaked up moisture in the air and went sticky enough for me to use a heat lamp to dry it back out. It&#039;s expensive but I&#039;d recommend it. <br /><br />I can also vouch for Symbiosis&#039;s coke, which is a bit cheaper. I&#039;ve not tried his 8ths but the price on those look great. I washed 800mg of Symb&#039;s (after snorting 4 lines) and it came back at about 650mg, after that I was doing 30-50mg lines an hour apart.<br /><br />The best stuff I&#039;ve had though was off ItalianMafiaBrussels, it&#039;s pre-washed, smells of nothing and is about eighty quid on the gram. Shame it ships from abroad though, I&#039;m not a big fan of getting caught smuggling. There&#039;s a lab test of that stuff inbound on the 24th, see the lab test thread.<br /><br />I recommend chipping in for some lab tests if you have spare change in your account.
