				Oh dear kinda proving your a scamming troll now arent we david? i owe you 20btc apparently yet you can afford to give 100btc away for help, so you will spend 3/4 grand to get a grand back, makes perfect sense.<br /><br />For people who are interested, the admin knows about this crazy guy and its already being cleared up here -&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=130894.0<br /><br />Threatning me in forums isnt going to make you any friends<br /><br /><br />

				Like ive cleared up on the other thread , yes admins can check messages and they will see nothing, we have already both copied and pasted your &#039; proof&#039;&#039;<br /><br />20btc doesnt you rich, you clearly think it does trying to claim i owe you that. But then again you can afford to throw away 100btc to get back 20btc, hmm none of this really makes sense does it.<br /><br />I think we all know who looks like the scammer here. If you were genuine you would let the admins do their work.
