				due to reasons in my &quot;real life&quot; i now have a merchant account at my bank. this allows me to run credit/debit cards.<br />the only negative is that turnaround time for your coins would be 24-48 hrs while the payment clears. i will only be charging 8%<br />above preev.com prices. preev.com is up to date to the minute for btc value. on top of the 8% therebwill also be a 3$ CC processing fee.<br />there is a limit up to 90 btc per day. considering this is a totally legit transaction i will have no problem proving my identity and providing a receit.<br />i may ask you to do the same or i may not it all depends if you throw up any red flags.<br /><br /><br />ps im not new ive been here awhile i just cant remember my user id!!!

				Hi, wishing you the best with your venture. Accepting credit cards seems highly risky, I mean a customer can dispute a transaction even 90 days later. It seems most of the time the credit card co sides with the credit card holder, especially on this kind of transaction.
