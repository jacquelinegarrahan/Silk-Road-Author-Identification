				Hi i have a few questions. <br />How much does silk road take for commission % whise?<br />Are the Bitcoin price listings live? Like do they change when the course change? Because it really goes up and down fast last few days<br />And How does security work? What happens if the DEA finds the silk road server. Can they login to everything and bust everyone? Or will they only be able to just shut it down. Or way worse will they be able to pose as undercover dealers?

				1. Commision? No clue<br />2. I believe the BTC is based on a 24hr average or something similar. So it does fluctuate but nowhere near market price.<br />3. This is why you encrypt your address when sending to a vendor. Assuming all the information is compromised your address will still be encrypted and only the vendor would be able to decrypt it. If you&#039;re encrypting your address the biggest concern is probably your vendor keeping your address written/printed out for some reason. Still probably nothing to worry about assuming everything is personal quantities. <br /><br />NOTE: Take all these with a grain of salt as this is also coming from a noob

				Regarding commission - I think (don&#039;t quote me on this) the commission is based on the sale price (higher price, lower commission - but theirs tiers for this). The approximate average is 6% but obliviously Vendor&#039;s can give a more accurate answer.
