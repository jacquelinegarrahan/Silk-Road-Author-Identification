				There is the event we call the Mephedrone Rainforest, where we split ten grams between a couple of people in a national park in the middle of a swamp.&nbsp; There&#039;s the Beach House trip where the band STS9 took over my mind with their alien music/science/powers and showed me the secrets of the universe on a shroom chocolate and 4-aco-Dmt.&nbsp; There&#039;s DragonCon 2010 with a hippy/science flip.&nbsp; 5-meo-DALT and meth combined feels like walking on clouds.&nbsp; I could go on and on.&nbsp; Drugs are so fun.&nbsp; Almost to 50.&nbsp; :)

				i like experimenting with new stuff a lot, so i&#039;m around the RC scene for some years now. i#m not recless, own a gempro 250 and always liquiddose sub-mg material.<br /><br />anyhow, one of the most intense experiences (apart from DMT) was a combination of 2C-D + 3-Meo-PCP + Ketamine.<br />Any PEA does awesome things to dissociatives, but this particular combination showed me worlds i cannot comprehend in the slightest. good thing: all positive.<br />

				ah btw... the most brutal mindfuck was on a (safe) combination of 25B-NBOMe, 4-ACO-DMT and MXE (i said save, because this is not a combo or material you should play around with. i did this more often, started very low and spaced a good time between each plateu).<br /><br />ended with a m-hole where i was the doctor at the birth of my boyfriends birth. and he assisted me getting himself born.<br />and i was the pregnant woman, that gave birth to him.<br /><br />now THATs a weird infinite loop of soul-bonding.

				I&#039;d have to say heroin, because of the 10 year shit storm and utter destruction of my life due to my serious character flaws, lack of self control and utter mind control that heroin causes in the predisposed.
