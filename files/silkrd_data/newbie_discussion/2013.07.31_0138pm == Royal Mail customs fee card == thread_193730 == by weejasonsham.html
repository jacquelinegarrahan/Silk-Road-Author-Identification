				i got a letter from customs a couple of weeks after i had 100g coke delivered - i just rang them up and paid it - don&#039;t mind paying £20 odd tax on 100g coke!<br /><br />i reckon it&#039;s legit - if customs found it you&#039;d have a knock at the door, not a letter saying &#039;insufficient postage&#039;. i&#039;d hurry up about paying it though, chances are it&#039;s pretty warm where it&#039;s being kept so it might start stinking.<br /><br />on top of that if it gets a return to sender and it&#039;s a fake address, they&#039;re gonna open it to see where it should be going, and all they&#039;re gonna find is a shit load of weed in a box with YOUR address on it

				yup agreed, pay it and take the package, doubt it&#039;s a set up, a lot of packages from america etc. will have customs fees.

				and you ordered half pound of bud to the same address? ballsy to say the least!<br /><br />maybe you can work something out with the vendor if you scan the letter and email it to them (securely obviously), but right now i&#039;d swallow the cost just to get your shit out of harms way
