				Hi, <br /><br />I&#039;m quiet new to SR but already bought successfully 5-6 times to France, mostly weed orders.<br /><br />Last month I left my country for 3-4 weeks and made 3 orders before leaving and just one arrive ( the one who arrived was from Sri Lanka and the two others where from Mexico and Spain ), assuming that all my previous orders where from EU and Sri Lanka and Mexico packages are quiet uncommon do you think there is a chance that my address is now flaged ? I didn&#039;t had any custom&#039;s letters or anything and all my orders are without signature.<br /><br />Thanks for your advice<br /><br />BlakBat<br /><br />PS: Sri Lanka was 10g, Spain was 25g and Mexico a OZ.

				Hi there im only been ordering for about 4 months now. Im from Australia by the way which has some pretty tough customs i just recently bought 25 xtc tabs from Netherlands had 2 of 3 packages show up but i use a different address i ordered from Canada only to be scammed just watch some of these vendors they never even send your package half the time as for marijuana that can be quite easy to detect if they didn&#039;t do good on there stealth packaging.

				Thanks for your experience, the Sri Lanka package was not perfectly stealth but the Spain and Mexican one should be better that&#039;s why I don&#039;t understand why they won&#039;t arrive...<br /><br />Anyway like you said we can&#039;t know if they sent or orders, I&#039;m not very confident about the two vendors but hopefully the Spain one will be reshipped and I&#039;m waiting for the Mexican answer.<br /><br />Any experience from someone who been flagged in EU would be welcome.
