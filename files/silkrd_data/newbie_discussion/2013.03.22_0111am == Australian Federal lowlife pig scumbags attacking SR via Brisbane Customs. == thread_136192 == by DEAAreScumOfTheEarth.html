				FYI people.<br /><br />I&#039;m a veteran SR buyer &amp; used to buy from Canada mainly. Right now, there is a &quot;blitz&quot; on &amp; nothing is getting from certain countries, to certain postcodes in Queensland.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if any other Australian states are affected.<br /><br />We here in Queensland, have the worst of the worst, anti-drug scum in the country. They aim their insidious intent towards us.<br /><br />We MUST fight back &amp; fig hard.<br /><br />They want to destroy us. We MUST destroy them.<br /><br />We are victims of this war. <br /><br />The feral pig scum who attack we, the innocent, are in the same category of human as the Terrorist who wishes to destroy &quot;the infidel&quot;.<br /><br />Neither have any right to impose themselves upon us &amp; both category of &quot;bad people&quot; deserve the same punishment. They MUST be removed from the face of the planet. <br /><br />Destroy or be destroyed. Kill or be killed. An eye for an eye. This philosophy is morally correct. Those who intend to &quot;destroy us&quot;, whether that be jailing us for years or actually killing us outright, both deserve the utmost punishment that we can deploy.<br /><br />Not only are the feral anti drug pigs themselves as guilty as hell, the disgraceful Politicians who keep this morally reprehensible war against us going, are just as guilty. They ALL deserve NO LESS THAN DEATH!!!<br /><br />The governments of the world have WAY overstepped their authority with this &quot;war against citizens BASIC human rights&quot; known as the &quot;War Against Drugs&quot;.<br /><br />Have ya noticed that the drunken scumbags have THEIR drug but we are not permitted to have ours? This is because when the US &amp; it&#039;s number one puppet, Australia (we in AUS blindly follow the dumb lead sheep, the US, without ANY thought at all. Our politicians are the most dumb of the dumb), tried to stop the rampant alcohol problems (as is STILL happening now), the feral drunks murdered many many people. The &quot;murderous&quot; nature of the drunk pile of crap who can&#039;t &quot;have a drink&quot;, is second to none.<br /><br />The VAST majority of police,worldwide, especially anti drug police, are raging, rampant alcohol addicts (yes that&#039;s right, Alcohol ADDICTS. We don&#039;t call Heroin users &quot;Heroinolics&quot; or Cannabis users &quot;Cannabinolics&quot; do we? It&#039;s time to call &quot;a spade a spade&quot;)<br /><br />The end of days is coming for anti drug pig scum. It costs only $20 000 per pig to have professionals remove them for good. And those who have the money to have the anti drug scum dealt with, can do so without ever being connected to he &quot;event&quot;.<br /><br />The &quot;Darknet&quot; is the resource that will allow this to happen. We now have the power to not only end the drug war, we also have the power to deliver retribution to ALL guilty pigs in ALL countries.<br /><br />We need to compile details on the guilty so that we can organize trials. As was done with the Nazis.<br /><br />The number one &quot;crime&quot; that ANY human can commit, is directing their &quot;Insidious Intent&quot; towards other people.<br /><br />Indeed, &quot;Insidious Intent&quot; MUST eventually be treated as the true crime that it is.<br /><br />The Nazis aimed &quot;Insidious Intent&quot; at Jews. They had the Hyde to call that &quot;My Job&quot; just as DEA scum &amp; other anti drug scum do. They were punished via the Nuremberg Trials<br /><br />The extremest Muslim &quot;Terrorists&quot; aim their Insidious Intent towards all non-Muslims. They consider that they are &quot;doing the work of god&quot;, just as many (or most) DEA scum &amp; other anti drug filth do. We continuously punish &quot;Terrorists&quot; &amp; will have to for many many years to come.<br /><br />The DEA &amp; other assorted anti drug scum call aiming Insidious Intent&quot; towards we, the innocent, &quot;My Job&quot; just as the Nazis did &amp; just as &quot;Terrorist&quot; continue to do.<br /><br />We need to undertake &quot;Trials&quot; of all guilty individuals within DEA (which is ALL employees of the DEA, both past &amp; present) &amp; other scum within other anti drug departments within ALL countries.<br /><br />The Individuals who are perpetrating these &quot;acts of terror &amp; aggression&quot; upon us, MUST be brought to justice.<br /><br />They are very literally, the worst scum on the face of the planet &amp; should be &quot;removed&quot; from it.<br /><br />The world will be SO much more peaceful without DEA &amp; their puppets.<br /><br />To all &quot;illegal drug users&quot;, be safe my people.<br /><br />To ALL DEA shit, Australian Fed &amp; Australian state &quot;drug squad&quot; Cuntholes, DIE FUCKERS. Your time is up.<br /><br />DEAAreScumOfTheEarth<br />

Take some time to to realize that drugs are fun. Hey, if you can&#039;t get any for a bit it&#039;s not the end of the world. The DEA will chill out at some stage and you&#039;ll be back in the biz
