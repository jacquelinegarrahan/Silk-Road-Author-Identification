We dropped some LSD and had a great time. It came to a point where I had to take a dump but it was to weird thinking about digging a hole in the great wide open to do it in so I held it in. I was still tripping when it was just too much to hold and it felt there was this great evil inside of me. I decided to part from my friends to go on my own personal journey through the desert to find just the right spot to deposit this great evil into the earth. I found my spot, dug a hole, squatted down, and as I was doing my thing when I looked out into the great wide open and it felt like the desert was staring at me. I had held it in so long that it was the MASSIVE load. When I was done I felt this euphoric rush. I felt like I had exorcised this great demon from my soul. It was weird but it was great. I buried the demon and trotted back to tell my friends of my adventure.
