				Hey guys, <br />I&#039;m new here to the road but I just recently made my first successful purchase from Lucydrop. I&#039;m looking to get some shrooms now, and two vendors came to my attention Blueveil, who has an ounce for $120, and aLWaYS FaT, who is selling an ounce for $100. Naturally, I&#039;m leaning toward the cheaper ounce, and the quality according feedback looks good, but my only concern is that FaT has only been a member for less than two weeks and 10 transactions, vs. Blueveil&#039;s 8 months and 130 transactions. Additionally, FaT does not use PGP. <br /><br />What do you guys think? Does this raise any red flags, i.e. sound too good to be true? Or am I just being paranoid?

				They&#039;re is no excuse to not be using PGP, especially as a vendor. Its completely unprofessional and i would personally be much happier to pay $20 more as so to have my details kept encrypted and safe.

				Thanks Kesser,<br />I was thinking along the same lines. I emailed him about his PGP key and he just replied with &quot;if you have sensitive info, just send me a private message.&quot; As if I wasn&#039;t already doing so!

				There*<br /><br />That is ridiculous, i can see nothing but problems from using him. It is so easy to set up and get working and the benefits as you know are huge. As i said, there is no reason not to use PGP. Its banged into everyone&#039;s head over on the security forums for a reason.
