				little background about me <br /><br />smoked pot everyday all day for years starting from half way thru high school thru college but stopped when i graduated... I dabbled with oxys had a solid habit for a bit (2 30mgs a day) but now i haven&#039;t done em in a 2 months. My main drug of choice today is benzos! specifically Xanax. Now i do suffer from social anxiety and have done for the past year.<br />I know that most employers will test for benzos. <br /><br />So i thought i would speak with someone about my issues. I&#039;ve just moved to a new place and now I don&#039;t know anybody and I&#039;m so far away from all my friends...my anxiety is worsening. Now doc puts me on a low does of seroquel half a 50mg xr for sleep. I was like forget it. A week later told him that didn&#039;t do anything which it wasn&#039;t btw. So he prescribed ambien 30 x10mg with 2 refills to me that seems like a lot haha. Im trying to get something for my anxiety,&nbsp; nothing crazy like i have been reading but maybe .5 or 1mg kpin x2 day. just to deal with my anxiety and obviously get through some interviews coming up and if they like me obviously with the doc note i can piss and show benzos all day.<br /><br />Thats the goal now most will probably disagree but ive been taking ambien and staying awake, one 10mg will make me really relaxed and no anxiety. doesnt show up on a drug test i dont think?<br />so what im asking you is should i do this if a job comes up?<br /><br />finally i just get my shipment of xanax and will completely own an interview but then i gotta pass a piss test. Any insights on these matters.... what would you do!<br />

				basically from the above message you can denote that <br />-i have a form of anxiety that is being diagnosed..they are gearing it toward sleep problems brought on by panic attacks. But my psych said in my last session what are your phobias...so it comes down to people, they make me feeling embarrassment when i shouldn&#039;t, loss of control of a situation, overwhelming sense of irrational fear in public places. are these not enough to warrant a script for a weak benzo...<br /><br />I just need a job period lol ! and trying to do it the least most stressful way HELP!&nbsp;

				I&#039;m confused to what you are trying to hide in a pee test. Unless you smoked weed within the past 30 days, all other drugs leave your system within 4 days. Weed stays longer since it is absorbed in your fat cells. There is NO miracle way to clean your system. Either substitute or dilute and there are PLENTY of places on the net that will give you advice for both. Don&#039;t waste your money on a kit to clean, it wont work.

				If you need to cheat the drug test, what works best for me is the substitution method. You can buy a kit that includes clean synthetic urine. You use a combination of body heat and a hand warmer to keep it at the correct temperature. There is a thermometer on the side of the cup so you can tell if the temperature is correct or not. It&#039;s better to keep it a little on the warm side because you can always cool it down either by waiting or putting in cool water. I would also try to dilute. I&#039;d do this in addition just in case you can&#039;t get the temperature correct on the synthetic piss. You&#039;ll know if the temp is correct though because the thermometer is right on the side of the cup and you&#039;ll know you&#039;ve passed because there is no way for there to be drugs in the synthetic piss. I&#039;ve never had them watch me for a employment drug test so using the substitute is pretty easy.

				dude they will only test see if u have weed in your system. i am on probation and they don&#039;t check to see if i am doing benzos. unless your doing a clinical study there not going to get all crazy and send your pee to a lab to test it. if your really lucky u will just to the mouth swab test and u could smoke the night before one of those as long as u brush your teeth really good the day of the drug test u will pass.
