				Um, <br /><br />cimicon has a lot of explaining to do. I&#039;d love you as the cs rep to PM me about my order from 1/20, I&#039;d love a explaination, as would lots of others. Percs, fast shipping, in transit 1/24 from the USA. Any of that sound familiar? Anyway, those orders not cancelled are still sitting in resolution as of this morning. I can&#039;t get on SR right now, so maybe something&#039;s changed, but a public explanation might go a long way. For your reference, here&#039;s lots of post relating to the subject, and many other issues:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99692.msg805570#msg805570
