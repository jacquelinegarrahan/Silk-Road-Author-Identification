				joined like 4 days ago bought 50 grams Mdma off supertrips<br />Right after that realised not one positive review for him lol..... Especially on the forums, I never look at feedback cause 100% of it is bullshit ass kissing makes it look so fake on almost everyone&#039;s vender profile. Anyone else think that?<br />Btw it&#039;s been 4 day&#039;s i got a bad feeling ever sence i ordered from him that on the 10th day i&#039;m gonna lose $2,000 Cause im a newby, FUCK i feel like such a retard :/<br />Also ordered like 800$ worth of 8 diffrent types of drugs :P Testing all the vender&#039;s out haha There goes the bank for now&nbsp; ;D

				I always wonder why people feel the need to dump large amounts when they get here. I visited this site for the first time during my second LSD trip and spent the entire trip just browsing the site. It was a marvelous experience. It took a couple transactions before I was ready to drop some serious dough, like a month. I&#039;m glad I did and it&#039;s almost to the point where I feel like there should be some transaction limit for new buyers. <br /><br />Think about the legit vender tempted with a $1200 order from a new user &quot;nobody in their right mind is gonna believe.&quot; All they gotta do is ask you to finalize early because they&#039;re &quot;Trusted&quot;. <br /><br />If you want to keep it in escrow then they send a dummy package through the postal network to the car dealership in town (courtesy of their rivals) and then they have tracking to win the resolution case in their favor. It&#039;s pretty easy when you think about it. What would you chose to do as a guy who&#039;s out to make a buck? Would you choose to fool the new buyer and keep both the drugs and the money or would you choose to risk sending a package that&#039;s going to be a headache costing you both time and money. It seems a pretty easy choice to me. <br /><br />Unethical? yes.<br /><br />Profitable? Also yes.<br /><br />To many people it&#039;s only the latter choice that matters. $1200 is rent dude.
