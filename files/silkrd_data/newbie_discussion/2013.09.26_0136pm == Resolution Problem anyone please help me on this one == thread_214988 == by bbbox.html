				Okay, I placed an order and my Vendor disappeared, hasn&#039;t logged in for weeks.&nbsp; I hit resolve and put in notes and asked for 100% refund.<br /><br />The order expires in 2 days and I got a message this morning saying my resolution will expire shortly.<br /><br />What does that mean, when my resolution expires, will I lose my money, or will Admins automatically resolve this for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why would my resolution expire, that scares me.<br /><br />Thanks,

				I&#039;m in a similar situation, and would like to know also. And with a seller disappearing, then my stats (auto-finalize, or refund or whatever happens) take a hit, all because the seller is inaccessible.

				Write a message to admin or whoever it is that runs the res center and request an extension for your resolution. While your at it, give them the details of your situation , explain that the seller is gone and ask them what recourse, if any, you have. <br /><br />Good luck Brutha....

				Thanks Yoda and 88fxstc - that is reassuring. I&#039;ll wait a day or so more to be fair to the seller, and hope it all works out.<br /><br />That fact about &quot;any refund granted will not be counted for buyer refund statistics. &quot; is really pretty fair.

				Bummer!<br /><br />The seller finally got it touch - he was, to be fair, on vacation. I waited until the day after he said he&#039;d back before I submitted the resolution which had just one day left.<br /><br />Long story short: he refunded 100%<br /><br />But now, I DEFINITELY have negative statistics in the form of a refund stat on my buyer profile.

				Sure enough - I just placed a new order and was asked to FE because of the refund stat.<br /><br />I need to FE because a seller just forgot or couldn&#039;t be bothered to send an order before going on vacation.<br /><br />Live and learn.

				No, he made no counter offer and offered a 100% refund.&nbsp; He apparently just forgot the order. Claims he had tracking but never claimed non-delivery. In fact, his seller page states &quot; ...&nbsp; if USPS tracking shows that package was not delivered I will do a reship but no refunds&quot;, and he agreed to 100% refund, so obviously he knows it wasn&#039;t sent.<br /><br />Unfortunate all around - nobody gained anything from this transaction. A waste of time for all involved, except nothing happens to him and I now have undesirable stats.

				Yeah, I see your point LOL<br /><br />What I&#039;m getting at, I guess, is that he conceded the point without argument; tacitly acknowledging that it was his error. And, (I guess this is just whining on my part), he breezes off with no consequence (I won&#039;t leave honest feedback &#039;cause I&#039;ll be blacklisted to boot) and I get jammed with bad stats and the need to FE.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll just have to stfu and deal with it :)

				Well, it seems the majority of vendors expressly state that they blacklist for less than 5/5.<br /><br />But, your question makes me think about whether this particular vendor would. I offered to leave a good review stating what actually happened (because he was a stand up guy about refunding although it is his stated policy not to) - he said he&#039;d prefer to just forget the whole thing, but understood that what I proposed to say was true. I just let it all go.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing this particular seller - in this particular case - wouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />Still, I now have to FE from these stats even though I acted in good faith throughout. The seller and I have no anger about this, but I have bad stats and he/she doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Such is life.<br /><br />

				Not to beat a dead horse, but to those that said they have to finalize early due to various reasons don&#039;t. As has been stated many times by senior members buy some cheap things like an ebook listing, etc. This will get your stats up somewhat. Also I&#039;ve had vendors cancel order on me before as they ran out of stock and have never received a negative rating towards my account or seen it negatively affect the vendors staats. Unless something has changed that I&#039;ve missed I would contact SR support, and if this are as they say they should be able to fix a &quot;glitch&quot; like that in little to no time.

Cancellations from either side shouldn&#039;t affect anything, AFAIAA. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s happened in the OP&#039;s case.

				Thank you to outlander14 - I got in touch with support as you suggested and they removed the 43% refund rate that resulted from the from the one transaction.<br /><br />Because the seller (who remained very cool throughout the process) didn&#039;t respond in the resolution process, it was removed.<br /><br />Thanks for the good advice!<br /><br />( I also apologise to bbbox for essentially hijacking his thread).
