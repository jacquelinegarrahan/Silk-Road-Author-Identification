				okay so I sent to an address 3 bitcoins on January 16 from my silkroad account that never showed at the address I sent to.&nbsp; I simply copy and pasted the address to send to into the withdraw section in my account settings.&nbsp; Blockchain.info doesn&#039;t show my silkroad bitcoin address in use for the 16th of January.&nbsp; So I guess they send from a different address and there is no way to trace in the case they don&#039;t arrive because you don&#039;t have the actual address they send from.&nbsp; Has anyone else ever had a problem with this?<br /><br />I have sent a message to admin asking for an explaination.

				No I do have the address I sent to.&nbsp; And yes the btcs are shown in my account history as left the account.&nbsp; I just need to know the address they were sent from to trace the transaction and to figure out what happened here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to make this mistake again because I don&#039;t see how I can recover those coins.<br /><br /><br />off topic comment-&nbsp; This forum is extremely pointless.&nbsp; This needs to be posted in technical section.&nbsp; I have been a member for close to a year and have made 20 posts.&nbsp; Now I have to make 50 posts in order to use the other sections that I have been using all along.&nbsp; This is a huge waste of time for me and others also.&nbsp; It takes forever to post with captcha and Tor combined.&nbsp;

				Well I am relieved I don&#039;t think the problem is on Silkroad end because I just sent .005 bitcoins to a different address from my silkroad account and they made it successfully.&nbsp; The place I am trying to send to is a sportsbetting bitcoin site.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have contacted them to see if they can help. <br /><br />My best guess is that the bitcoin address they sent me is corrupted in some way and can&#039;t recieve bitcoins.&nbsp; The reason I say this is about one hour ago I tried to send .005 bitcoins to this address from mtgox and they haven&#039;t shown up yet and the address I sent to shows up as never being used on blockchain.info.<br /><br />So I basically am still waiting on silkroad admin to reply back to the 2 messages I sent them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully they can tell me where those 3 bitcoins where sent from (i.e. the actual bitcoin address) so that I can trace on blockchain.info and see what happened to them.<br /><br />Other than that I don&#039;t know what happened here exactly yet.<br /><br />Oh can this topic please be moved to technical section please?<br />I don&#039;t think I am going to get much help with this situation from a newbie&#039;s forum.

				Okay so I have figured out the bitcoins are not lost they are stolen.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am trying to get to the bottom of what happened.&nbsp; Bascially I tried to send to a sportbetting BTC site and the coins never showed up.&nbsp; So I figured the mistake must be on my end, like maybe I sent to the wrong address.&nbsp; Cool fine I can accept that.&nbsp; However SR support replies back saying that I sent the coins to an address I don&#039;t have any records to on my computer.&nbsp; Okay fine again.&nbsp; I must have sent to an account that I have deleted the info to or something.&nbsp; However, NOT SO FAST AGAIN, because the BTC address I sent these 3 BTC coins to arrived the same day I sent them.&nbsp; It was a new address (never been used before) and the coins were sent out to two different address two days later by someone who obviously wasn&#039;t me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Considering the fact that I didn&#039;t contact SR support until&nbsp; almost 6 days later, 4 days after these coins had already been moved.
