				I tried to scan the forums a bit, so sorry if this has been discussed before.<br /><br />SWIM is a small-time personal user of the road. He/she always orders domestically, with a near-perfect success rate. For some reason though, SWIM got a &quot;love letter&quot; from Customs claiming they&#039;ve seized a very large amount (like, 10-times what he/she has ever spent on the road) of a particular substance addressed to SWIM.<br /><br />Now obviously I want to be careful about what I say because I don&#039;t want to give away any identities, but he/she has never had any interest in said substance (not that he/she is going to judge anyone over their own choices).<br /><br />Anybody else heard of anything like that? What&#039;s the &quot;best practice&quot; in these kinds of situations anyway?

				Can you paraphrase what the letter read, I&#039;m curious.

				Reads a bit like a legal document. Claims that they&#039;re aware that SWIM has an &quot;interest&quot; in the package, and basically gives him/her the option to try and claim it, abandon it, and some other options that I would need an attorney to understand (neither SWIM nor I am an attorney).<br /><br />My first instinct is that maybe that one &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; deal was in fact LEO, and they&#039;re trying to bait SWIM into doing something stupid? If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;d find it hard to believe that he/she is the only one on their target list. We&#039;re just speculating, but still a very odd letter to get in the mail.

				Another thought that crossed my mind is that maybe one of SWIM&#039;s vendors got pinched and LEO&#039;s went through their address book in order to try and bait some info via PM&#039;s or whatever.<br />If that&#039;s the case, be careful out there! My friend is just small time, but I&#039;m sure that if he/she were dealing in the kind of quantity mentioned in this letter it could be bad news if something was compromised there. I don&#039;t want to drum up unnecessary paranoia, but if this is some sort of fishing venture by LEO&#039;s then it would make sense to at least talk about it...
