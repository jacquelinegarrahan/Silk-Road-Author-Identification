				I have recently used medsman for xanax but he informed me he was starting into the H business and he was only taking so many customers over a brief period then going stealth mode. Anyways long story short he customized my usual xanax order with a gram of his #4 Heroin and i was expecting half ass as usual but oh my god!!!!!! This stuff is straight off the brick and hard as a rock and dissolves in water very easily, I am old school and its been a long time since i felt that warm fuzzy feeling starting at the top of my head and working down to my toeas and it had a very euphoric feel yet not a lazy high more like a forget all of your worries and get up and laugh and have fun. I have ordered from Supremesmoke, Gotsitall,Subs, Marlo and the only one to come close i would say may be SS when he first has his pebbles. I suggest everyone going and checking out the pics and you will see in the ad its nothing but rock and i just want to say thank you to Medsman for such a great ride!!!! He said he will be putting up larger order options after his 1/4 gram options have been bought up as he wants people to get a taste before they spend any big money and if i remember correctly he has the tester listings for like 60 bucks and the shit is way worth it. Meds man you have a regular customer in me for sure!!! Also does anyone know how many post i have to put up before i am not considered a newbie??? Thanks medsman for treating me like a person as well , seems alot of H sellers think their time is too valuable to spaar to answer a few questions.<br />meow for now<br />CW123
