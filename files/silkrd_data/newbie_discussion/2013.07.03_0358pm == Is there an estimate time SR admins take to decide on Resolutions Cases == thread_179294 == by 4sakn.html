				Hiya guys, I have been a member for the road for about 6 months now been buying like a crazy chipmunk hoarding nuts for winter haha, Unfortunatly recently a Vendor by the name of Limitless &quot;Sent&quot; me my order almost a month ago (Never recieved, First package I havent) and has now been unreachable for over 7 days (Apparently has been scamming people for the past month according to feedback). I have in the past week and a half put forward 2 different resolutions (1) to extend the date of auto finalize and (2) a refund. Neither of which I have had any response from him about. I am currently just waiting for SR admins to decide and I was hoping that someone here knew the average time it took for a resolution to be decided. Anyone?<br /><br />Regards<br />4sakn

You say that you haven&#039;t had a response from Lim for either proposal.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; How long is left then on the original 17 days? Unless a time extension has been agreed to by both parties, once the 17 days are up, they&#039;ll make a decision on your submitted proposal.
