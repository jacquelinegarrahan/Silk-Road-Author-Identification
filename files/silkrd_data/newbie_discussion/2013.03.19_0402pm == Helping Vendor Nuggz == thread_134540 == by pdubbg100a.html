				Listen Up SR Community<br /><br />What we all must understand is even-though most us will never see each other in real life or talk on the phone with each&nbsp; other we (do) talk here,<br />make money here, get medicated here and come here to trade in a discrete and somewhat safe manner. SR is a beautiful thing. It is our victory against<br />government control, wannabe stickup kids, fake dealers and so on.<br /><br />Thats why i feel like its our duty to weed out the scammers/people with ill intentions, keep each other informed/educated on various SR issues such as<br />security and so forth and ultimately help each other out any way we can. We do that we all make money, get what we need and prosper.<br /><br />I never shopped with Nuggz but i was going to (couldnt get coin in time) i was eying that Shiskaberry. I read what happened and kinda felt sorry for the man.<br /><br />The reason i started this thread is because i feel we have the oppertunity to come together, make a small donation and get (from what i hear) a good vendor back<br />up and rolling again. I also feel like the people who received that unexpected package have more of an obligation to pay the man.<br /><br />But here&#039;s my idea:<br /><br />I already messaged Nuggz and told him he should put a status area on his profile page that list what he is owed and how much he got in so far and keep it<br />updated until he reaches his goal. Once he reaches his goal if the people who really owe him start paying him off (and he has received more money than he<br />was owed) maybe he can start rewarding the people that donated (but didnt owe him) with gift codes or something like that.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t that how we suppose to work together?<br />Let me know what you think!

				People who owe him?&nbsp; Owe him for what?&nbsp; I&#039;m confused.&nbsp; If he sends the orders out to the buyer, then the buyer finalizes their order ... so maybe I&#039;m missing something that happened where somehow people owe him money?

				Also, OP, you have 7 posts here so ... little bit strange that you&#039;re asking people to donate to a vendor ... unless you are that vendor under a different username.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can you please explain what happened to Nuggz that is making you ask for donations on his behalf?

				I wanna stay on topic so imma try to be quick<br /><br />what happened:<br />i guess the vendor made some sort of screw up and cancelled orders but shipped the out anyway and has been kindly<br />asking for payment. if you goto his profile page there&#039;s a little more information: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a4276b2c16/30<br /><br />i am in no way affiliated with or the vendor himself (stop it!)<br /><br />would it be any different if i had 2500 posts (with the exception of two i try to leave meaningful/informative&nbsp; posts)<br /><br />im always browsing vendors trying to find the best ones and dude seem solid. we need to keep good vendors (good vendors=good business=good money 4 everyone ;) )<br /><br />

				Okay, I believe that you aren&#039;t related to Nuggz - just seemed strange, and with the number of scammers popping up every day, being overly cautious is a requirement.<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m not sure about Nuggz.

A $10 donation aint shit. Imma donate sometime this evening,<br />I have close to no coin left after placing orders with SDM and Lucy (welcome back!!!) yesterday but thats also why i said he should put a status area on his profile page <br />and once the people (who really owe him) pay him back, if they decide to, he could simply give us a gift code or something like that. That way everyone is good.

				You are free to donate - as is anyone else who wants to - however, I&#039;d caution everyone before doing that.<br /><br />Also, are you saying you placed an order with LucyDrop yesterday?&nbsp; Because their listings have been removed for a few days due to the account being run by a scammer.

				Hey pdubbg100a thanks so much. I really appreciate what you are trying to do. I have to agree with the others though, I think you are me under another name. <br /><br />He did get it right though. I canceled and then shipped a bunch of orders. It was simply one of those perfect storm kind of mornings and I made a hasty, bad decision. A couple of them actually. <br /><br />I&#039;m not calling anybody out, bitching, or asking for donations. If I were to do that you would tell me the same thing you would tell any buyer who was screwed because they FE&#039;d. The SR system works. When you fuck with it you get fucked. It&#039;s that simple. <br /><br />My only hope was that those who did receive packages would try to make good. I know if I got canceled I&#039;d order somewhere else right away, so I knew not everybody would be able to. But in that batch of orders were also two QP&#039;s and a bow. Not a peep. I recovered less than 5% in total from a handful of good souls.<br /><br />Because of this and the backlash it caused with my associates I decided it was best to shut down for the season. It&#039;s a suck way to go out, but it&#039;s all part of lifes journey. What a bore it would be if it were all easy. <br /><br />I have grown so much these past few months. SR is a part of me now. I&#039;ll be back next season (Do vendor names expire?) and, just as you would expect from life, I&#039;ll be older, smarter, and better prepared. And I&#039;ll have a shitton of pot. <br /><br />peace all <br /><br /><br /><br />
