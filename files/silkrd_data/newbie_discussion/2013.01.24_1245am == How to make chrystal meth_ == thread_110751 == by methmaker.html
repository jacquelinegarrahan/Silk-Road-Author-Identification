				If you did want to make it, several cookbooks can be found on google. My advice would be to forget about it; you&#039;ll never be able to make gear as pure as some of the vendors have, and its not exactly expensive to buy. Just leave it to the professionals.

				If you watch enough meth documentaries, you will see how to do the shitty shake and bake method. <br />One documentary will not show you everything, but if you watch enough, you will see the complete process. Then google for confirmation. <br />You will most likely burn your house down on first attempt, but good luck!

				Step 1) Learn to spell crystal.<br />Step 2) Making meth isn&#039;t that hard, to be honest if you can follow a cake recipe you can make some shake-n-bake at least. Making really pure meth is a-whole-nother story. And, without sounding like too much of a&nbsp; dick, if you can&#039;t spell crystal then I doubt that you have it in you to produce some high-grade shards. However, if you&#039;re certain you want to try, studying up on some basic organic chemistry is the place to start; acid-base extractions, distillation, simple stuff like that. Reading Uncle Fester&#039;s &#039;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&#039; is also good, but it can&#039;t be used as the end-all guide as it does contain some errors. Strike&#039;s &#039;Total Synthesis 2&#039; is also a must-read, and his &#039;Sources&#039; book is also worth a look too. Archives of &#039;The Hive&#039; and &#039;Synthetical&#039; (both of which were clandestine-chemist forums) can be found on the deep web, and are also extremely useful. But even after all this, even if you find a method which you can reasonably carry out, it&#039;s unlikely you will have great success until you understand the chemistry inside every reaction of every step of the process. Then, if you&#039;re skilled, you can make adjustments to the method based off your practice and experience, and create something truly brilliant ;)<br /><br />Main point being; there is no easy method. Study hard and you might make it!<br />- JH

				Breaking Bad is such a good series! <br /><br />But come on... anything that suggests &quot;blue&quot; is sign of high purity is not something to use as guide to drug manufacture.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enroll at university. Then you can.. uh .. break bad later. <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.
