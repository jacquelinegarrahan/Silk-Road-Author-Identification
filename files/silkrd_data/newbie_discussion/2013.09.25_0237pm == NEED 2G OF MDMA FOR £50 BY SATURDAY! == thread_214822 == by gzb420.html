				Hey guys,<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m posting in the wrong place or if I sound overly desperate, but on Monday evening I ordered 4 Green Androids from Chemical Brothers and I need my gear for this sick rave on Saturday, and I&#039;m not fully confident they&#039;ll come in time from the Netherlands so I would like to order a couple grams of Molly as well for me and a couple mates with guaranteed delivery (to the UK) for Saturday. Last week I know it would have been easy to get a gram for less than £25 and have it come through your door a day or two later but now all of the prices seem to be raised and I can&#039;t seem to get any domestic Mandy for under 30 a gram. I know it&#039;s only £5 difference but I just know that if I pay more then a cheaper listing will come up a day later and also the Androids will come in time!<br /><br />Anyone suggest anything? Perhaps maybe a foreign vendor with cheap enough courier shipping? I&#039;m too new to know what to do so some friendly advice would be appreciated :)

				Bump?<br /><br />Sorry guys for being an annoying newbie, I&#039;m just very worried I won&#039;t have any MD come Saturday and that will ruin my night as it&#039;s for friends as well :(<br /><br />Cheers!

				Well you better get busy shopping.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t really see how waiting for someone to post will solve this issue for you.

				I agree and tbh I&#039;m fully aware of the fact I look like a stupid newbie right now, but maybe a SR senior can give me a hint I didn&#039;t know about like a Dutch vendor who does cheap courier shipping or something, but it seems unlikely I guess.<br /><br />Are any vendors reading this (if any) who are currently out of stock going to be restocking with reasonable prices tomorrow or Friday? I know Smile Crew are restocking tomorrow and he assured me his next batch is what he thinks is his best yet, but that means there will be a price tag to go with it.

				Give either symbiosis or technohippy a go, in terms of getting it for saturday you shouldn&#039;t have to worry even on a wednesday night. I&#039;ve had orders with sym arrive within 24 hours of me placing the order.<br /><br />(You could try THs nintendos, 170mg. I tried them for the first time last week and they are decent!)<br /><br />Not looked into their current prices etc but you should be about right tbh :)<br /><br />S

				Hi gzb, the £5 difference in price is the price of one can Red Stripe at most bashes! Order from Techno hippy, they are super reliable, but I bet Chem Bros come through for you they have every time for me.<br /><br />BTW, the green androids pretty good, had them at a festival recently for Jon Hopkins, Andy Weatherall, Erol Alkan and had a great time. Who you going to see?<br /><br />

				Hahaha I didn&#039;t mean anything special like a festival or anything. Just a shitty squat rave but I feel like I need an excuse to have some fun before I start having to get my teeth in to work properly now, but in comparison to other squat raves I&#039;ve been to this one&#039;s meant to be good. Sorry to disappoint :( I can see how I built this up to be like I really need this gear for something amazing and special, but the real secret is I&#039;m going raving with these girls who have never dropped before but wanna do it for the first time this weekend ;)<br /><br />And yeah I have too tried the Androids. I remember around 40 minutes after I dropped the full pill it hit me like a slap in the face. Then for the next 10 seconds I felt it kept getting stronger by the second. It&#039;s worth noting my two friends only dropped half a pill. That day all I had eaten was a bowl of Coco-Pops around 11 hours beforehand and had a few sips of water to wallow the pill with. So once it hit me I&#039;d realised I&#039;d taken too much without enough water, so one of my friends made me sit down so I told my other friend I need some and she frantically rushes through her friend&#039;s bag and pulls out a water bottle. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t hear her say it was filled with vodka and thinking it&#039;s water I downed half the bottle. A little bit of time later (have no idea whatsoever how long) I&#039;m throwing up, which is when my friend that made me sit down forces me to go outside with him. At this point I&#039;m fucking drunk and pinging and am sitting outside for about an hour and a half swaying from side to side, only realising what I&#039;m doing every once in a while. Then thankfully I got through the night and believe it or not I actually had a very enjoyable time once it wore off a bit, but not something I&#039;d do again. Meanwhilst my friends who had only dropped half said they were still fucked and had no idea how I got through the night on a whole pill and all the vodka, and my mate who dropped the second half about 5 hours later said he felt like he was on acid after having it, but I&#039;m sure he was exaggerating a little bit.<br /><br />Two lessons I&#039;ve learnt?<br />1. Half a green Android for the first few hours of the night<br />2. NEVER drink and drop!<br /><br />Also to those suggesting I buy other pills, I would but I quite like having crystal MDMA to supplement pills simply because I can take lines and dabs when I need (like when I&#039;m waiting for a bomb or pill to kick in) and also because it&#039;s better for sharing which is handy for this weekend. Hoping Smile Crew uploads good value MDMA in a few hours now! Shame Nelson Muntz went on holiday - he would have been ideal for this situation :(

				well, at 90% of raves they sell molly and ketamine, so no worries, just buy 1.0 grams and pay extra for 1-2 day shipping
