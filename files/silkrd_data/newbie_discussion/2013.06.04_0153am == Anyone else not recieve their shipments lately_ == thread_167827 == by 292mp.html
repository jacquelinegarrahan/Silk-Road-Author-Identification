				Hi guys, newbie to the forums but not to SR.<br /><br />Has anyone else had shipments delayed lately? <br /><br />I placed two orders last thursday from two seperate vendors and payed for EXPRESS shipping. Neither of them have arrived yet, and they were both marked as in transit the same day. One vendor i have used before with express shipping and it was at my door 24 hours later. I have emailed them both and one vendor replied and said the USPS credit card processors were down last week, and the severe weather we have had lately is delaying shipments. Anyone else not getting their express orders on time? I am hoping they will arrive tomorrow.<br /><br />thanks guys.<br /><br />my buyer stats:<br />Total transactions: 25<br />Total spent: à¸¿102.99<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 7 months<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been on here for a couple months.&nbsp; My strategy is to use established vendors with top stats, even if I have to FE as a new user. (I know FE is controversial, but I&#039;m not doing big $ transactions so I&#039;m comfortable with the risk)&nbsp; &nbsp;I have 7 purchases that have taken between 3 and 9 days to arrive.&nbsp; So far the road has been good to me.&nbsp; My advice would be to be patient, some vendors don&#039;t ship every day for stealth reasons.<br /><br /><br />

				No delivery problems but delivery times can be all over the map, even with express. <br /><br />Unless its from SpaceWrangler, in which case I believe your order was actually delivered TO space - one-way....:)

				haha well are yall situated in large cities as well??&nbsp; i know that not everyone has express delivered by someone else, maybe it&#039;s a decision they make when they&#039;re serving a large/heavily-populated area??&nbsp; who knows, but i&#039;m glad she&#039;s there, cuz she does NOT fuck around, the second that express envelope hits your hand she&#039;s already halfway back to the truck and on to the next one... a true pro

				LOL I&#039;m rural as well, I usually don&#039;t receive my mail till around 3pm, but when I get express, It&#039;s quite early and the lady drives like a lunatic.. BTW, VERY RURAL like 30 miles outside of town.

				Yes!&nbsp; Steadily over the past few months, transit times have been getting slower ( 2 days, next order 3 days, etc...).<br />I ordered from a top 2% vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a completely issue-less customer of theirs.&nbsp; Transit never more than 3 days.&nbsp; It&#039;s been 7 whole days since I placed my last order.&nbsp; Nothing yet.&nbsp; I sent a polite, short, non confrontational message yesterday, but they haven&#039;t read it yet.&nbsp; Rude.&nbsp; So I sent another (encrypted this time) message this evening.<br />Very discouraging.<br />I don&#039;t want to be that dramatic annoying junkie blowin&#039; up a vendor&#039;s inbox or anything, but I was counting on that and it&#039;s becoming more than inconvenient every day.<br />Ugh. Spoiled druggie problems...<br />

				I&#039;ve had that problem now and before with a few and it makes me fuckin crazy. Between them Vendors (you know who you are) and the USPS who likes to play with themselves even when it comes to&nbsp; priority mail so their cost don&#039;t go up and take forever. It&#039;s only gonna get worse to with them you think they would catch a clue as to why their business has dropped so radically. <br /><br />Screw it if you can&#039;t get my order out in 5 days I&#039;m canceling and going with another vendor who will. That&#039;s what I say although I expect it to be shipped within 48 hours which is reasonable in most cases.
