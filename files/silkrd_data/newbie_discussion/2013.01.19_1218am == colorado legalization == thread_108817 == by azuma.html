				I really hope other states legalize marijuana too. I don&#039;t understand why they DON&#039;T!! It&#039;s frustrating at times to accept the fact that I can&#039;t smoke a good old blunt where I feel comfortable.

				Colorado and Washington&#039;s legalization is the first step towards full legalization across the country in my opinion. I do believe it will happen someday although it might not be real soon. I think the older generation that used to think pot was a terrible drug are now being fed the true facts and that has changed their way of thinking. The younger generation growing up now have the facts already which will make them more informed adults later on. Marijuana is the safest drug out there that has medicinal and spiritual purpose. Something that helpful can&#039;t be illegal forever.

				Most liberal laws in the world as far as I know. In amsterdam I don&#039;t think it&#039;s legal to grow AT ALL. Of course, the federal gov says it&#039;s all illegal, but our constitution says that the federal gov should have NOTHING to do with criminal laws, only commerce/national defense laws. <br /><br />Prohibition / child porn / guns are the criminal laws the the feds used to have nothing to do with.

				The time is now, we are seeing the shift....<br /><br />the whole federal vs state thing is still up in the air but I believe the details must be hashed out by Jan 1 2014... plenty of medical patients have mentioned the rush already in the Denver area.<br /><br />Things are blowing up until the feds slaps down the iron fist after they realize the true revenue that will be had from full legalization.<br /><br />See you as the world turns my friends..

				Other than our own US president, our congress, and current federal laws, the US has a veritable cornucopia of treaties and other obligations through the UN and with hundreds of countries on things such as keeping certain substances illicit across the board. The US government cannot simply abandon these obligations and treaties just to legalize cannabis. This is why how the current change in law in WA and CO plays out under the watch of the feds will be very interesting to see. But at any rate I am hopeful, it is a step in the right direction.
