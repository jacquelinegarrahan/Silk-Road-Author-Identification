For me 3-5g&#039;s is a LOT!<br />Not PLANNING on passing a bunch out, but you know how that goes once the word gets out<br />I&#039;m too old to go &quot;clubbing&quot; but I absolutely JONES for my once-every-2-3 month 12 hr roll in the hay with the wife!<br />&nbsp;Can ANYBODY give me a solid US lead?...keeping in mind that I&#039;d like to hear from the people who have tried and had a great time with significant other ;)

				Your best bet is to get the most pure MDMA you can and take 10-20mg of Adderall with it. It is likely the roll you are trying to recreate was MDMA and some sort of speed mixed together.

Also, I was under the impression that brown=more impurities? So I&#039;ve been looking for more clear shards type stuff..if I&#039;m wrong PLEASE educate me :)<br />&nbsp;I have never done adderall, in the past I HAVE mixed MDXX w/blow but I do NOT wanna &quot;jones&quot; or have a hard time sleeping after a prolonged &quot;session&quot; ;)<br />&nbsp;If you could help me find that &quot;90&#039;s&quot; roll I&#039;m looking for I would be ETERNALLY grateful :)<br />thanks again..I WLL be in touch VERY SOON<br />~PB2k

				I do not have any MDMA listings atm. Sorry.<br /><br />Brown is impurities, however, white or clear can still be less pure. The stuff I had is widely regarded as the best there is despite the brown color. I am positive a bit of adderall will give you exactly what you want. <br /><br />- E

				I find that MDA is the best to have sex on. Although I&#039;m keen to try MDMA with Viagra or Adderal as Empathy said

				Fatman is it easier to get a hard on on MDA instead of MDMA?&nbsp; Because I have tried the little blue pills while on MDMA and still nothing and I&#039;m only 24.&nbsp; I was thinking about using Levitra next time and see if it makes a difference.&nbsp;

				Right on!<br />&nbsp;Thanks EVERYONE for the help..and just to reiterate, what I got from Emp101 was top-shelf! Wish he had more, I&#039;m not impatient...I can wait (yeah, now I KNOW I&#039;m just gettin old LOL)<br /><br />&nbsp;@ EMP101 - Thank you, kins sir, you have been much help, both here on the forums AND in PMs..I might be old, but never too old to learn a few new &quot;tricks&quot; ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;@ FATMAN - I would also like to know why, in your experience MDA is the winner for sex? I was under the impression that MDA was the MORE &quot;couch lock&quot; of the 2? Please educate me :)<br /><br />&nbsp;@ Absinthe - What does the &quot;BK&quot; stand for? excuse my ignorance, but that&#039;s how we learn...from asking questions, right? :). Also, PLEASE DO let me know if you find a righteous DOMESTIC vendor that can &quot;get me where I wanna go&quot;. It would be greatly appreciated..if EMPATHY101 can come through though, I wouldn&#039;t hesitiate to jump on a little xtra this time<br /><br />&nbsp;And btw, I&#039;ve got my blue pills hehe...never really helped during a trip. Don&#039;t get me wrong...not so old the flag only goes half-mast, but during a double-digit hr session, well...you know what I&#039;m getting at LOL<br />&nbsp;ALL of you are very cool to help a new guy out..it is MUCH appreciated :) Gettin old sux..esp when I FEEL so young :)<br />wish I could give &quot;karma&quot;..I&#039;d +1 all of ya :)<br />~PB2k
