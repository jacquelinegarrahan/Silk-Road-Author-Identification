				There are some interesting topics in your list...<br />but I find it quite strange that no one has replied on any of the threads I checked. <br /><br />It seems that you&#039;ve been VERY busy over the last month or so.<br />Also you&#039;re sharing A LOT of information, often quite specific - I&#039;m not sure (in the long run) if this will be good for you, or for those who are reading it... <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve decided to change the scope of this thread to include all Small-Time Projects as well which wasn&#039;t originally my plan. I&#039;m getting so many new ideas I want to explore this would quickly clog up the thread New Vendor - Burning Babylon: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160527.msg1243955 My intention is revealing as much information as possible without compromising the nature of any specific vendor, including us.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are some interesting topics in your list...<br />but I find it quite strange that no one has replied on any of the threads I checked. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are two options, either people are too lazy to contribute or they think the information should be classified. I&#039;m suspecting its the second option for the most part but I don&#039;t fully understand the thinking behind it as it&#039;s akin to &quot;Security Through Obscurity&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It seems that you&#039;ve been VERY busy over the last month or so.<br />Also you&#039;re sharing A LOT of information, often quite specific - I&#039;m not sure (in the long run) if this will be good for you, or for those who are reading it...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If we eventually get caught it most likely won&#039;t be due to technical reasons, our risks are the greatest at this moment as we currently can&#039;t afford outsourcing some of the risks like having others posting the mail or having a separate building for packaging. Not sure what you mean with the second part, if it is somehow bad for others to read our posts because they might get a heart attack or likewise they should just stop reading.&nbsp; :P

But I also think that some of it should not be &quot;handed over&quot;; if someone wants to know he should do the research himself. Researching makes you learn a lot of stuff, not only find an answer to the specific question you had to start with - especially on this Road...
