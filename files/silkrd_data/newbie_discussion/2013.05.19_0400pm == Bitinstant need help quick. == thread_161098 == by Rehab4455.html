				I usually had a different methods to acquire bitcoins.<br /><br />I need help on how the process works.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I did.<br /><br />Walmart (CashDeposit) - Mtgox account.<br />Filled out fake Name.<br />Than took me to Zip Pay or what ever to Print off a Slip.<br /><br />I take the slip to the service desk, but what&#039;s the process after that? I know they make you get on the phone, but what questions do they ask. :-\ :-\ :-\<br /><br /><br />

				<br /><br />So far, I&#039;ve used BitInstant twice. <br /><br />They ask you your name and address, then they confirm how much you&#039;re sending. They&#039;ll also ask for a phone number, but I do believe that information is optional. As long as you&#039;ve got information for them, it doesn&#039;t much matter whether it&#039;s actually yours or not. Just make sure the name you use at bitinstant is the same name you use when they ask or it won&#039;t go through. I would, however, make sure that I did give them accurate information for someone just&nbsp; in case there is a problem with your transaction because the woman at the last place I used told me that in that case, ID would be required to fix it. I&#039;ve had no trouble with it so far. The BTC has been waiting in my wallet before I get home.

				I wouldn&#039;t use MtGox, use bitstamp! Bitcoins are cheaper on bitstamp too so it&#039;ll save you moneys, and they won&#039;t freeze your account if use tor. Make sure you access either using a public computer, or using tor for bitstamp, don&#039;t use your own computer or else your bitcoins aren&#039;t very anonymous.<br /><br />UPDATE : you should&#039;ve used used bitinstant from an anonymous computer too (not over tor for bitinstant). If your bitcoins are truly anonymous, then tumbling them isn&#039;t necessary.

				So I take it BitInstant is the only way to buy coins without having to connect to a bank account?&nbsp; Is there any other way that will allow us to put in more than 500$ at a time?&nbsp; Its a pain in the ass to have to do more than one transaction.
