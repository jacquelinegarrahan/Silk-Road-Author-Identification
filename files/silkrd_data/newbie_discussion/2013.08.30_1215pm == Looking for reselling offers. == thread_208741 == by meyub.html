				So that&#039;s my first post here, would like to say hello to the community and thanks to Dread Pirate Roberts and his team for creating it. I&#039;ve been for a long time around here, never posted on forums and never bought anything, but now it&#039;s time to change that.<br /><br />Looking for good stuff starting from any stimulants (party drugs) to cannabis and such, no trippy products like lsd or shrooms.. I&#039;m not a consumer but I&#039;ve been into the business here at my place( old school dealing) for some time now. And I can see crazy shits selling around there which cannot be found in my whole country. That means a lots of clients with no competition= lots of money (which is my main goal).<br />I have around $350-$400 for investment (start off) of any good quality product. And I&#039;ll be working with no more than 3 vendors if I have a good offer from them. I&#039;ve been doing this many times making a ladder starting of a little and going on big numbers. As a new buyer I will accept any kind of terms from anyone, I rely on trust and on people who want to get their shits out of their houses having some dollar numbers afterwards. If the stuff and price is good. A lot of orders will be taken. On the second month we may end up on killos... So please if you have any good offers you can PM me or type something down there. A vendor with good FE will have an advantage on the list. I really work fast and numbers grow like taking a breath. First two weeks there will be orders for around $500 after that big numbers come.

				How long exactly have you been around here? Not long enough to know that FE does not mean feedback I guess?<br /><br />Also, considering you have &quot;been doing this many times&quot; and &quot;going on big numbers&quot; why is it that you only have $350-$400 to start off? Did your previous &quot;going on big numbers&quot; ventures just fall apart or did they never actually exist?<br /><br />Welcome to the community. Build your reputation around here the honest way, don&#039;t show up and explain to us that you are something when you can&#039;t demonstrate it. You&#039;ve been &quot;old school dealing&quot; long enough to have heard the term &quot;Put up or Shut up.&quot; before, am I right?

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;re aware of the fact that you need to pay 500$ (4.04 BTC right now I think??) to bond your Vendor account. So your costs are going to be more than 350$ for the first batch. Honestly, I don&#039;t think that you&#039;re going to be able to get started with 350$ unless you already have your product and you&#039;re going to save up 150$ more for the bond. I would assume you would want to start off with 1,500$. 500$ for the bond, 1,000$ for the product which you can usually make about 1700-2000$ (700-1000$ profit) from that initial 1,000$. From 350$ I see you making about 150$ profit, which WORKS but you&#039;re still down from that bond.

				PK, I don&#039;t think he is talking about vending on SR. It looks like he is planning on being a buyer and supplying his local market. His brand of English isn&#039;t exactly clear, maybe he will return and clarify.
