				wallet to SR is easy.&nbsp; bitinstant works well. <br />depending how much you intend to buy/sell - linking a bank account with coinbase.com is super easy.<br />multibit has a great wallet. bitcoinity.org/markets is the best site to track BTc price/value.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

				- localbitcoins.com is awesome and gives you lots of options from cash in hand to online payments plus immediate access to bitcoins<br />- mtgox.com (based in Tokyo) is the original bitcoin exchange and you can transfer funds to them thru internet banking or wire transfer, but it can take up to 48 hours for an international deposit.<br />- virwox.com has a credit card/paypal to bitcoin option with ridiculously low fees but you might have to first convert your USD/EUR to Lindens (Second Life), then Lindens to BTC, and then you can send them to a bitcoin address.&nbsp; But don&#039;t hold your breath and you are limited to approx $80 of transactions every 24 hours as a new user.<br />Most of the other online services charge commissions of 5%-10%
