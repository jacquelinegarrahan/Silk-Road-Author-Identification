				If you live in the U.S. do not ever sign for a package, no matter what the vendor asks. If you sign for a package that contains illicit goods than the police have the right to raid your residence. Most people know about this but TRUST me, if you are new than NEVER sign.

				It&#039;s the same most places. As far as couriers/postal companies are concerned signing for a package means you&#039;ve checked the contents and are happy and they can wash their hands of responsibility. In fact that&#039;s the whole point of it. Obviously not great for receiving drugs but it depends how confident you are in the stealth.

				Would it be the vendor specifically asking to sign, or just sending the package with required certification? <br />Would a vendor do this just because they want to make sure they&#039;re not getting screwed by the recipient saying the package never arrived?

				First off, love the name Jack. <br /><br />The issue that my friend ran into was a package between U.S. states. Like Jack N Hoff said, the odds are stacked in your favor and you probably won&#039;t run into issues. However the whole incident was enough for me to decide against accepting anything that requires a signature. To each their own, <br />I just wanted to bring attention to the issue to any newbs. And please think twice if a &#039;friend&#039; asks you to pick up/sign for a package.<br /><br />ps FedEx can be very sneaky&nbsp; ;)

				don&#039;t see the difference - sometimes people mention that it&#039;s ok to use real address to receive, since &quot;anybody can send anything to anybody in the mail&quot;<br /><br />so if that&#039;s the case, if one signs for the package, can&#039;t you just say &quot;no idea what it was inside&quot;<br /><br />say if the package traced to the mailbox, if there is your name but you don&#039;t sign, it&#039;s still has your name on it<br /><br />not trying to start an argument here, just what&#039;s the legal difference?
