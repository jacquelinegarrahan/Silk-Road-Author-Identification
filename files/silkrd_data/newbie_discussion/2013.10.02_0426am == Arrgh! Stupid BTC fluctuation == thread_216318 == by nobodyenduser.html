				People in the forums often do bum each other bits of coin. I expect that Bongtree&#039;s monopoly comment was directed to Chillinfast. Given your reaction his goodwill to you may well be off the table. <br /><br />For future reference you can always call someone an asshole at a later date. It is hard to unsay it when you are a bit to quick with it.

You&#039;re right, maybe i did jump the gun with the name calling and I never want to be the asshole myself so i removed the remark.<br /><br />I was just super frustrated at the whole deal now it is 32 cents down or .0025 btc<br /><br />Either the vendor can modify the order or I will wait until the BTC rises or maybe just say fuck it to the whole thing. <br /><br />One thing is sure, I don&#039;t feel like tumbling more btc into my account since the tumblers have a minimum amount you need to process.

				I suppose you could simply wait till the price moves in your favor and buy then, unless the vendor took his offer down already.
