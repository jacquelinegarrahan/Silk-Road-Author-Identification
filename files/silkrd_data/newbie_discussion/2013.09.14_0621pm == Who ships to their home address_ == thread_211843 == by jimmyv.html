				You should change this to a poll.&nbsp; User&#039;s shouldn&#039;t be announcing on the forums that they ship to their home address.&nbsp; The less personal information left on the forums the better.&nbsp; In other words, &#039;better safe than sorry&#039;.

				Good idea Captain-it&#039;s done.<br /><br />I ask the question because everyone tries to maintain anonymity throughout the entire process but in the end when you send out your address to &quot;someone&quot; and have parcels dropped off there,&nbsp; your ID can be compromised. Although even a box requires ID so they know who you are anyway unless you have a source for some fake ID.

				Hmmm, my friends don&#039;t roll like that. Even if I paid them. The only advantage I see to a box is the sender doesn&#039;t know where you live but they&#039;re not supposed to store your add&#039;y anyway. If someone else wanted to know, it can be traced to your house anyway. My gut says it&#039;s easier and safer to be able to pop out of my house, grab what&#039;s in the box rather than drive to an unfamiliar post office and grab it there. Either way it&#039;s unlikely anything will happen anyway.

That aside, so long as one covers their digital tracks online and refrains from self incrimination, then one will always have plausible deniability on their side. Always. Just make sure that wherever you have the vendor deliver it to is as clean of contraband as possible or very, very, well hidden. In the off-chance event of a LE with a warrant coming to your door. Just keep your lips locked and talk to your lawyer, NOT THE LE. <br /><br />Think of all of it this way: lets say there is a politician that you HATE. You want to smear his name and get him in trouble. So you decided to send a few grams of coke to his address and anonymously tip the LE about it. Do you think that plan will ever work? Never. The politician will just deny it and claim that they are a victim of a smear campaign. <br /><br />Thing is, same goes for anyone else. Just deny it, you have no idea who, what, when, or why someone would send you drugs. Right? Right.<br /><br />Never self incriminate.

				The general rule is:<br /><br />If you do not have access to a safe drop box, an address where you can have the package delivered and pick up safely, then yes, use your home address and real name.&nbsp; But, change the spelling of your name just a bit.<br /><br />Change &#039;John to Jon&#039; or &#039;Steven to Stephen&#039;.&nbsp; Change it just enough so you can say &#039;Hey, that isn&#039;t me, its not spelled right&#039; but not enough that the post office might get suspicious or not deliver it.<br /><br />

				^If anything imo that would just make you look more suspicious if you got caught.. So long as you haven&#039;t left any online traces they have nothing on you, no evidence. Otherwise you could send some drugs to someone you didnt like for example and get them busted if you were a prick. BEst thing to doif you&#039;re a bit of a paranoid guy is to write &#039;Return to sender&#039; once you&#039;ve recieved a package and leave it for 2 days. Then in the unlikely event of your house getting raided due to a CD or whatever, you can say you didn&#039;t order anything which is why you were going to take it back to the post office<br /><br />I can&#039;t see how changing 1 letter on your name would help a court case in any way whatsoever, but i&#039;m well open to being enlightened!

				Been wondering what to do as well with the following.. What if you are living at a place which is not your registered address? Would that cause problems? I&#039;m staying at a family member&#039;s place so hopefully it wouldn&#039;t be an issue.

				My advice is this if you have the tor browser on your internal HDD and make an order to your home address get that drive hidden as soon as you make it, this is just in case the feds pop up at your house at the end of the day anyone can find your name and address these days but if the feds find that precious drive of yours this will be used against you and there will be no denying anything remember that the governments know of the tor network.<br /><br />Keep safe<br />MrNice:)<br />

				Some people also have an awful lot more to lose, y&#039;know family don&#039;t know what they&#039;re up to, proper jobs, US travel etc etc<br /><br />I guess extra care should be taken with larger delivery&#039;s, or when the dispatch country is Holland or Colombia.

				I have a business post box, which goes to a serviced office. <br /><br />No name goes on the envelope/package just the business name. Not addressed to anyone then, and the serviced office has a post box that is accessible to anyone.<br /><br />And I only order personal amounts. <br /><br />If I wanted to deal then I would go for a drop box and isolate from my real ID.

If you HAVE to do it use a adult friend or even a PO box, but have a bit of respect for the folk who brought you up (unless they&#039;re okay with it, in which case, party away)

				Yeah, you&#039;d be&nbsp; surprised (if your naive) how different a friend can be being questioned, compared to when you&#039;re having a laugh knocking about with em. Especially if they arn&#039;t the brightest spark either, or havnt had past exp with the law. try keep all your shit - as your shit :)<br /><br />Why do people find it so hard to follow 1 rule? KEEP QUIET AND ASK FOR A LAWYER!, NEVER SAY A WORD!

				Wow. Reading this thread has made me a bit nervous. I am getting ready to put together my very first SR order (after lurking forever). I do not have the money (or transportation, really) to fuck with a box and am currently staying with my parents for a little while. I plan to start off with a small order of a few hits of blotter, maybe a Fent patch, something that won&#039;t look like more than a letter in the mail.<br /><br />I do realize what I am risking and the disrespect of ordering to my folk&#039;s place... but honestly I don&#039;t have many other realistic options. I thought about at least putting the next door neighbor&#039;s address so it looks less suspicious. We do live in a very small, very heavily policed town so maybe I should hold off until I get my own place again? (Yeah, right...) My hubby is currently rooming with someone while he&#039;s working. I&#039;ve thought about having it sent to his address but for obvious reasons I&#039;d much rather it get to me first.<br /><br />One thing that also makes me nervous is that I haven&#039;t been the absolute stealthiest in covering my digital tracks. I may have made a Google search or two for SR in my regular browser and have been on Bitcoin related sites outside of Tor as well. I&#039;m fairly certain I don&#039;t have much to worry about with tiny orders but I would like any advice you can give.<br /><br />Honestly I would be way too nervous to use this site at all if it weren&#039;t for the fact that I have seen others do it. A friend of mine orders small things directly to his apartment using his real name and has no problem. He lives in student housing and is very clean cut, could easily deny it. I have dreads and am usually pretty much pigeonholed as a &quot;druggie,&quot; so I&#039;m afraid I&#039;d have a harder time if I ever had to deal with LE. *shudders* Don&#039;t even want to think about that...<br /><br />Anyway once again, any and all advice is much appreciated. To recap: PO box isn&#039;t really an option, staying with my folks in a very small/heavily policed town, only other option is my hubby&#039;s place but then I&#039;d have to wait days or maybe even a week or so for him to bring me (what&#039;s left). I was considering working my way up to a couple bags of H but I do think I&#039;ll at least wait on that until I&#039;m not at my parent&#039;s place. Maybe just some moon rocks? Ugh I&#039;m just itching to order already! :)

				I use a PO Box opened with false ID (not hard at all to do) I know their are reasons against both but for me it&#039;s more for protection of my family. i do like the idea of a business box I was thinking of opening a second for extra security reasons so I might look into thata one, thanks man.

Sending it to the neighbor is fine as well, as long as they won&#039;t open it either.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about searching for tor, millions of people do and it&#039;s not illegal, and can&#039;t trace you to an sr account.<br />Don&#039;t overthink things, just do it and you&#039;ll be amazed at what the road will bring ;D<br />~D

If the address on his post were to be corrected I know that the people now living there would leave it for me to pick up.<br /><br />I am in the fortunate position of living alone with not much to lose. I also only buy the sort of personal amounts that thousands of people buy every day and therefore consider myself at low risk of LE wanting to devote significant resources to me.<br /><br />*Edit for clarification:<br />[*] For non-illegal post
