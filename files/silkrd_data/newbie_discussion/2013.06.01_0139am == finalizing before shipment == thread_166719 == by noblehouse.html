				Hello good SR folks,<br /><br />I only have a 5 transactions under my belt, but this latest vendor is asking me to finalize before he ships. Is this a normal request?<br /><br />&quot;Thank you for your recent order. I have packaged your shipment and its ready to be mailed. However we are requiring that you finalize early prior to shipping. You will still receive our guarantee that the order will arrive. This order will be tracked and if the tracking number indicates that it was not delivered due to an error on our part we will re-ship free. If you need any thing else please PM me but please remember that your item will not be dropped in the box until you FE. I Can either ship after you FE or I will issue a 100% refund. Please just let me know and I will have it done!&quot;

				Vendors that are established, with a certain number of sales, reserve the right to ask any one to FE if they see fit..<br /><br />I advise you read sellers profiles thoroughly before placing an order, as they will all state there FE policy on their profiles.

				We always advise that you stay in escrow and do not finalize early.&nbsp; If the vendor is requesting that you finalize early, you can ask them to cancel the order, and you can place it with a different vendor.

				Spamming to 50. I only FE once, and it worked out fine, but this vendor was very reputable and has something in quantities that are not common on SR right now. I don&#039;t think I will FE again, though. It&#039;s just not a good idea for many reasons. Find another vendor. The more we avoid the FE vendors now, the more options we will have in the long run because they will find that they can&#039;t demand that.

				don&#039;t do that. this kind of practice encourages others to continue asking for FE and you yourself know why that can be bad. ;)<br /><br />yet, if i couldn&#039;t find the item i&#039;m looking for in any other place, i would check 1) time (how long the vendor&#039;s registered), 2) rep (his rating and reviews), 3) responses of legitimate users in the forum. <br /><br />and of course the best would be not to order for a big sum, as you risk your money. this way if the package arrives, you can test the quality of the product, yet, that doesn&#039;t mean he won&#039;t rip you off the next time. ;)<br /><br />also, vendors do not usually offer a 100% refund as it would be not profitable (they have to pay for products themselves). keep that in mind. <br /><br />cheers and good luck with the order!

				I am new with only my 4th orders and there are plenty of good vendors that do not require you to fe ( finalise early ) so as a customer you have a choice. As already said check the vendors profile and the forums. I know of a vendor I want to use that requires fe if you have less than 10 orders and his reviews are great he clearly is honest and I understand why he would like that. However I personally will wait until I have done 10 orders before I use him.

				if the vendor is established (&gt;300 transations) and has a very good rating (&gt;99%) you&#039;ll probably be safe.&nbsp; if you are spending more then you could afford to lose tho, never FE.

				I say, if the chance is worth it and the stats are good enough, it&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />That being said, Bill Murray is right...&nbsp; DO NOT FE unless you are willing to lose your investment :/<br /><br />Good luck, and mind listing which vendor this is?&nbsp; There are a few good ones who primarily/only deal in FE transactions and there&#039;s usually a good reason for it.&nbsp; But sometimes it just isn&#039;t worth the risk (lost some money to bcpltd on my first time trying to FE, but luckily it wasn&#039;t that much)

				I was just asked to participate (fall for) an FE scam this week.&nbsp; Vendor ImportConnection asked me to FE.&nbsp; I said no.&nbsp; Now the vendor says that there was a shipping mistake and I should ask SR Resolution for a refund.&nbsp; I see in Forum posts that this was a scam, and that the people who did FE got taken.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do it, and don&#039;t think you need to.&nbsp; Reputable vendors have a right to ask, and you have a right to say no, and take your money elsewhere.

				been a member for a couple months and for the most part have always done my research before buying from a vender and making sure they had a bunch if good transactions under their belt with great feedback, but was up late one night and looking for best price for a particular item.&nbsp; Well import connection was about 2/3 the price of the lowest venders and it was a pharmacutical drug so wasn&#039;t worried about quality.&nbsp; I looked at his feedback and it looked good, I got greedy and ordered as much as I had the BTC for.&nbsp; Not that long after placing the order I was doing more research and got the feeling he was a scammer. I know, I know....I did the research backwards but anyway&nbsp; due to what others were saying in the forums I messaged him right away to cancel the order. but the next day I had the message everyone had got that ordered from him about FE.&nbsp; I told him I wouldn&#039;t and it was obviously a scam because in the message he said he would include bonus pills in my current order for FE and in my message back I told him I wanted to cancel the order. his message back was it was to late, so I messeged SR support about it, they said my BTC were safe as I was in escrow.&nbsp; I finally got them back today, over 10 BTC&#039;s almost 2 weeks later.&nbsp; They did a good job of finding out about this guy pretty quick and I feel bad for anyone who FE and is out of luck

				As a noob I decided going in I was not gonna FE for anything at any time. Well...last night I saw a deal from a vendor for free shipping plus extra 2g for FE. It was not a lot of money so I made the order. Within 20mins the vendor had msg me saying he would mark in transit and if I had FE within the next 24 hrs. I would receive by weeks end. Took a chance.

				I understand how vendors are reluctant to sell to absolutely new buyers, those with no or perhaps one or two purchases.&nbsp; There are a lot of buyer scammers too.&nbsp; I really recommend that people new to the road make small purchases initially.&nbsp; That way you won&#039;t commit too much in the way of funds on a product you might not like, and if you are requested to FE, after diligent research and in view of the number of sales and rating of the vendor, I think that is ok just to build up your profile.&nbsp; But risk the minimum and do your research.&nbsp; I got carried away when I discovered the Road and made more purchases then I should have, of larger amounts then necessary, and was disappointed with some products, but I never was burned by anyone.&nbsp; There are reliable vendors and you do have to prove yourself a reliable buyer to get a rating and set a vendor at ease.&nbsp; It works both ways.
