				Apparently i created my account while using Tor wich locks withdraws until you get verified. SO would it be safe if i were to make one buy, using my identity on mtgox, for lets say 5 hits of Sid, than deleted my account, create another? Perhaps a block chain wallet would help? or 2? I just want to make this order, ive been dicking around with this for like a week now..

				I told you what you need to do..<br /><br />Get an fake ID...<br />Get a fake utility bill...<br />Upload &quot;from a real IP and log into the account<br /><br />If you dont want this account send it to me I will get it unlocked and split the BTC in it...<br /><br />If you just want some coin to buy 5 hits thats not alot of money and get a moneypak, order BTC from a SR vendor and then you will have it in your SR account to buy Trippy Tripp!!!

A fake id would take time and i dont have the money really to play with here, im t i g h t. I only have .6 bits.<br /><br />So whats a moneypak friend, how much does it cost and how does it work??? I mean sounds like that might be the way to go.. i just cant afford to make any more wrong steps... Feel?
