				I think if you can move up then go for it (i.e. you live in Rwanda and can somehow get a Swiss PP then go for it). <br /><br />But if it&#039;s not trading up HUGE then it&#039;s something to really consider.

				I&#039;m not in the US, and haven&#039;t visited for almost 10 years, due to legal troubles. I&#039;d love to be able to go again someday. My country isn&#039;t much better, but I have causes I feel more strongly about that drug legalization.

				I&#039;ve considered leaving &#039;murica.&nbsp; It&#039;s still the best place in the world to start a business, though Israel is catching up.&nbsp; Same goes for a lot of the other higher level careers.&nbsp; We import intelligence from all over the world, and we&#039;re able to do that because we pay intelligence so well.&nbsp; Only Norway pays engineers better, but the cost of living is so high there that it doesn&#039;t actually equate to having more money.&nbsp; Nobody pays (or trains) doctors as well, though Obama is fixing to fuck that up for us. Until America stops properly reimbursing it&#039;s professionals, I&#039;ll probably stick around.&nbsp; Sucks our population is half-retarded from too much fast food and fox news, but we&#039;re still a very adaptive country with a lot of tools to thrive under it&#039;s belt.

				America is not without it&#039;s issues.. the politics and many of the polices are embarrassing.<br />No alternative is perfect.. unless you can move to a small island where the government doesn&#039;t care about most things but keeps a stable rule of law.<br /><br />one can dream...
