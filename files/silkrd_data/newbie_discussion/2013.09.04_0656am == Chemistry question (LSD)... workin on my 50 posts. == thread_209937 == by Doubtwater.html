				I was just wonderin... was looking into synth procedures and found what seems to be a legit recepie from erowid i think... Not that I am capable of these procedures or foolish enough to try this shit outside a properly equipped lab. I mostly want to file the recepie away and make sure people have it so if they meet a chemist they may spread the joy to others and join the family ^.^ I think if its legit I may file it away in a time capsule too... but I digress.<br /><br />Anybody out there who knows a bit of o-chem verify if these procedures are legit and whether a lysergic amide extracted from seeds etc really work the same in the synth as ergot alkaloids stripped from ergot fungus culture?<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyody who can help!<br /><br />[All text used without permission<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the &quot;Whole Drug Manufacturers Catalog&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any typos are YOUR problem<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For informational purposes only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I take NO responsibility for YOUR actions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be careful&nbsp; --Ed.]<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE: the techniques described herein are potentially dangerous.
