				Well, soon I will be coming to country where I can easily get some acid, so when I will be coming home I&#039;d like to take some with me.<br />I can easily send it by post but post works really bad in my country so acid can even not came to me.<br />Actually I know where I will put it - in a book. But therefore a few questions:<br />Will it soak up into the pages?<br />And what about drug dogs? I know they kinda can smell acid.<br />I will need to get on 3 planes in order to get home so there&#039;s another one - should I put it into carryon or luggage?<br /><br />Thanks for your answers in advance.

				To be honest with you I have never smuggled anything on a plane and don&#039;t think I would. I have seen on this thread before numerous times and the only answer people say which seems to work is to put it in a condom and put said condom in your harris or vadge.

				It&#039;s LSD. I don&#039;t see how you could get caught with it unless it&#039;s like thousands of hits. Just put it with papers taped to one of them and nobody will ever notice. It&#039;s odorless and nobody&#039;s looking for that. They really only train to look out for cannabis, meth, coke and heroin.

				lsd is odorless (which is why some vendors wont bother vacuum sealing it). just put it in a folder with notebook paper or in between the pages of a notepad and you should be good.<br /><br />ive never seen dogs at an airport either, but thats just based on my experiences.

				Can you name the country where you can score LSD really easy? I also wouldn&#039;t see a problem putting it in a book and unless the pages are wet no worries about it leaking off the tabs.

				My only concern would be if it&#039;s perforated . If it&#039;s unperforated, you should be fine just sticking it in a book or your wallet with some receipts and other pieces of paper. If it&#039;s on plain, white unperforated, that&#039;s even better. Then I&#039;d just write myself a note in pencil and stick it in my wallet.

				Guys, I know it&#039;s &quot;oderless&quot;, but it is so only for people. Dogs can smell acid but I really wonder if they&#039;re trained for it.<br />So I&#039;ll see if airports have any dogs and maybe give it a shot.<br />Thanks everyone for answers! I will post the results of how it&#039;s all went.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178683.msg1291833#msg1291833">Quote from: f1shtr4pp3r on June 30, 2013, 05:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My only concern would be if it&#039;s perforated .

				Put it in my wallet and just had my wallet in my bag during the flight... It&#039;s a piece of paper...<br />No issues international multiple flights while using the acid enroute as well.
