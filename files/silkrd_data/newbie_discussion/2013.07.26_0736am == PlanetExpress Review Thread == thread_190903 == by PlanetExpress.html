				I admit I&#039;m really intrigued by this vendor.&nbsp; The price of his stuff is insane.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how he can sell it so low, considering that even before it was recently banned it was like $80/gram.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve only ever seen it as a tan colored powder.&nbsp; But his is a fluffy white powder.&nbsp; That makes me a bit suspicious.<br /><br />Despite those misgivings, I placed an order anyway.&nbsp; The price is so good, how can I not, right?&nbsp; His communication has been on point every time I had a question, so that&#039;s a good sign.&nbsp; Once I receive the product I will gladly come back and update this thread.

				Placed an order for a 200mg sample of your 6-apb. Had to do regular shipping as I didn&#039;t have enough BTC for priority. If it is good quality I will be back to order more. Cannot wait to try your 6-APB. Finding a good source outside Benzo Fury has been near impossible! Cheers.

				I too have just placed an order for 200mg of 6 apb. Excellent price for this product which almost makes me skeptical. I ordered priority shipping, so I suppose I will be one of this vendor&#039;s first customers. Cant wait to try it out. Will update with more info upon arrival. <br />

Best show EVAR. <br /><br />SO depressing that it&#039;s almost over (again) (for good). I remember how excited I was on the day I heard the news that it was coming back after it&#039;s cancellation on Fox. It was so amazing you could never have even asked or anticipated it; the way Firefly fans must have felt when they heard about Serenity (I only discovered the show through the movie), or how hard-core Veronica Mars fans must feel now (I watched the entire series and can barely muster enough enthusiasm for an &quot;eh&quot;). <br /><br />But watching new episodes of FUTURAMA is like a euphoria no drug could touch... childhood Christmas present level warm and fuzzy nostalgia style. Knowing that no more episodes are coming, and likely never will, is like running into the girl you wasted your entire High School experience fawning over, only now she&#039;s a strung out stripper working the place you decided to go for your bachelor party (okay maybe that metaphor was a bit too personal). Truth.

				I finally got around to trying 100 mgs of planetexpress&#039;s 6-apb and oh my fucking god hahaha.<br /><br />I almost feel like this substance shouldnt be called a research chemical honestly. it has a sacred &quot;magic&quot; aspect to it that is extremely similar to the true mdxx substances.<br /><br />I took it with my girl yesterday(100 mgs each, both experienced with mdma and mda) and within 30-40 minutes we both started feeling light effects. within 1 hour we were both laid out, to the point to where the thought of moving was just a real fucking bummer hahaha. she was laying her head on the table and i was sprawled out in my seat.<br /><br />at that point we had a few interesting conversations, and a few really cool ideas popped up in my head while talking. the most memorable one was the idea that i could build a &quot;neighborhood&quot; in a forest, without chopping down any trees and ridding it of all life. Imagine if humans built houses AROUND the environment instead of just mowing it over. work with mother nature harmoniously instead of just killing it all so we can build some useless shit and put it there......<br /><br />anyways......&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />slowly but surely the outside world started taking on a sort of fairy-land appearance just like my FIRST experience with mdma. everything was getting more vivid in color and things began to trace lightly.<br /><br />she told me that her visuals were very intense whether her eyes were open or shut, and i definitely had some rainbow fishscale patterns on the back of my eyelids at somepoints, even though i took lsd 6 days ago and had one of the most visual trips ive ever had hahaha.<br /><br />once we finally got over that main peak, we started to feel at one with the universe. the main come up is definitely a bit intense but once you level out you feel AMAZING. my limbs felt so loose and wobbly. my body felt like it weighed a ton and my temperature fluxuated a bit at some points during the experience. sometimes i would feel like i was wrapped in a blanket. other times i would be getting goosebumps because of a breeze hitting my skin.<br /><br />music was awesome as expected, and sex was very interesting as well. (a good interesting, we tried out a few new things&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />the main &quot;in your face&quot; euphoria started dying down at about 7 hours, but i was still left with plenty of visual movement and a great body high at that point. the only real bummer about the experience happened shortly after. I started to get some head pressure that was pretty unpleasant. i took an ibuprofen and me and my girl went to her room and had sex again, which completely healed the headache and had me feeling high as fuck again once i had an orgasm.<br /><br />we hit the lights shortly after and went to bed shortly after (at this point its been around 11 hours or so since we took it.)<br /><br />we woke up this morning cuddled up with eachother and we both still felt great. cuddling was so fucking comforting and nice! we had sex again in the morning and it was still &quot;enhanced&quot; to an extent, but obviously not as intense as it was the night before.<br /><br />all in all, I would feel like a fucking retard if i didn&#039;t get a shit ton more of this 6-apb... seriously that experience for that price.... it just doesnt happen folks.

				Received my 200mg 6apb. Actually came out to 300mg! Thanks PE! We split the 300mg into two 150mg doses and took them. The roll felt very good and slight visuals became pronounced further into the trip. The quality of PE&#039;s 6-apb far exceeds others I have seen on the road, especially for the price!! Looks like an affordable vendor of upper grade 6-apb has appeared! Absolutely great product for the price, but not as potent as the old Benzo Fury tabs.<br /><br />All in all, definitely worth the price and will give a great roll at 150mg in my experience.

				i thoroughly enjoyed my transaction with PE.&nbsp; everything from customer service, shipping, stealth packaging, and the product itself were top notch.<br /><br />I dosed 3 different times over the course of the last two weeks - insufflation, swallowing, and plugging.&nbsp; Of all of those, swallowing worked out the best.&nbsp; Snorting doesn&#039;t burn that bad, but it tastes beyond terrible on the drip.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t recommend that method.<br /><br />I did not have a 6-8 hour roll the other posters, but that may have been because I was drunk each time I dosed.&nbsp; Surely that would diminish the effects somewhat.<br /><br />PE will def be getting another order when I need to re-up.

				I was a bit worried about PlanetExpress since his product was the cheapest available. I have to say that my expectations and what happened were different. The transaction was quick, clean and I was even contacted personally about updates on my item shipping. Very personable and quick acting when orders come in. Order arrived in a fast manner and came in a very stylish little baggy with art patterns on it. That was a very nice touch. and I compared the product to the product being sold by the &quot;bestseller&quot; in &quot;Prescriptions&gt;Stimulants&quot; for addy. I have to say I was not disappointed with the quality differences. If no one told me - I probably wouldn&#039;t have noticed the difference between the experience on his product and the experiences I had from this drug, buying from top sellers. <br /><br />The product wasn&#039;t vacuum sealed but I didn&#039;t feel this degraded the quality of the item whatsoever.<br /><br />PlanetExpress definitely deserves good credit reviews - Or at least, I was satisfied with my experience anyway. I can&#039;t speak for every other customer.

				I ordered a few valium from PlanetExpress on a Friday, regular first class shipping.<br />Honestly I really didnt expect anything until the end of the following week. <br />It showed up on Tuesday, which was awesome, and it was legit valium. <br />Great transaction all around, I did have some communication with him/her and they were polite and responsive..<br />All in all a solid experience.

				I&#039;m in the same boat, getting &#039;feels too good to be true&#039; vibes but I&#039;ve bought sub-$4 acid on the road that ended up being legit (koi hoffmans from HollandOnline) before, and this vendor thusfar has a good reputation.<br /><br />Ordered a half sheet, and if it gets here by Friday I&#039;ll have a few posted on Sunday.&nbsp; Otherwise I won&#039;t get around to it for at least two weeks.<br /><br />Oh, and regarding the &#039;5/5 review regardless of product&#039; issue:&nbsp; If you message the vendor with your issue with product quality and they flat out refuse to negotiate, would you want to buy from them again anyway?&nbsp; Blacklist doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s mutual.&nbsp; It&#039;s an unenforceable policy, basically.&nbsp; I get the feeling it won&#039;t come down to that though, based on the skepticism of his 6-APB and how it turned out to be solid.

				&quot;Then what on earth is the point of the feedback system?&nbsp; I could set up an account with the same rule, send out absolute bunk, and while I may not get repeat customers, I&#039;ll be able to scam everyone once because the rule says you aren&#039;t allowed to leave any negative feedback about product quality.&quot;<br /><br />The point of the feedback system is to enable honest, good vendors to build a reputation which will support their businesses by enticing new customers to purchase from them as well as retaining current customers.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very fair and equitable system so long as buyers understand what qualifies as a 5 rating: you get your product, with decent stealth packaging, in a reasonable amount of time, and it is at least approximately what the vendor said it would be.&nbsp; Again - the strength or potency of the product is too subjective to use as a basis for rating the vendors overall business operation.&nbsp; Buyers try to scam vendors this way, so it&#039;s reasonable to leave that criterion out of the overall rating (though it&#039;s nice when people comment on the quality/potency for the benefit of other buyers.<br /><br />You won&#039;t be able to scam everyone once, you&#039;ll be able to scam a few people before you become widely known as a scammer.&nbsp; So you put down $500 to become a vendor, run a quick scam that ruins your reputation immediately, and bow out having maybe made a tiny profit?&nbsp; Seems like an unlikely scenario.&nbsp; It would be much easier and much more feasible to be an honest vendor.&nbsp; If a vendor is scamming people as you&#039;ve described, the resolution center will always favor the buyer and you won&#039;t ultimately end up getting screwed out of any money.<br /><br />You seem to be getting more and more entrenched in this position of ridiculous paranoia over what is essentially a non-issue.&nbsp; We now live in a time when you can order virtually any substance you want and receive it relatively quickly through the mail.&nbsp; All the vendors ask is that you don&#039;t screw up their rating as long as they are fulfilling their end of the agreement.&nbsp; You started by saying you find it &#039;a bit suspicious&#039; that vendors would enact such a policy, and have now escalated it to &#039;draconian.&#039;&nbsp; Your hyperbole knows no bounds.&nbsp; If you think their is anything &#039;draconian&#039; about anything on SR, or that anyone is &#039;blackmailing&#039; you due to having a fairly standard policy, please do yourself a favor and look up the actual definitions of those words.

I have found vendors to often be much different than what they say about themselves on their profile. Most say &quot;PM me with any issues and we&#039;ll work it out&quot; I did that with one vendor (bad quality product) and they called me stupid and dishonest. I didn&#039;t try to extort, etc. I don&#039;t ask for refunds, reships, etc EVER. That isn&#039;t a way to get the buyer to deal with you again, be polite and reasonable and I will do buy from you again.

				Ordered Roxy&#039;s on Monday night, still processing yet today. I know his profile said they will either ship out wednesday (yesterday) or thursday (today) so still waiting for the in-transit.

				Once again I agree with CMK. It should be fairly easy to edit the profile page and reword that. It is in everyone&#039;s best interest to make every effort to resolve issues before leaving feedback. It seems sometimes if a buyer complains the vendor immediately assumes it&#039;s an effort to extort or scam the vendor. Not always true. Vendors scales may not be properly calibrated or they may have gotten a weak batch of product or they may have thought they shipped when they didn&#039;t (Yes it can happen, it happened to me twice) so please vendors assume the buyer is on the up and up until you find out otherwise, and you will and buyers should assume the vendor is acting in good faith until they know otherwise, and they will eventually.

				Okay so I honestly was trying to fool myself by being not skeptical but I feel too many things line up. One being that it is his first time selling all these new drugs at decent quantities and as far I as I know there has been no samples of any of these new listings (aside from his apb). Everyone who got these new items seem to be still &#039;processing&#039; the order which could be a sign of him piling up all these orders to cash out on, and now on top of this I get asked to FE and while I must admit I have an account that appears new it is most definitely a second account. I really hope I am proven wrong, as these prices for lucy are incred... please someone prove me wrong and show me I&#039;m being a paranoid cucumber.

I saw this coming before it happened no one was ordering from his larger good priced items? yesterday there were 400 roxies if you put it in your cart later in the day there were only a few left which i snapped up and now he has almost 1000 of them available if you put it in your cart??? Not many people can come up with 1000 roxies at a time and if they could they certainly could wait a few days to be paid for them clearly!!!!&nbsp; Im not going ahead with this order which is a damn shame as i thought i could get some low priced roxys and and eightball of tar for a reasonable price. How do I not have to have a cancel on my record? I just have to ride it out and let SR sort it out huh? everyone should boycott his ask for FE, there is no sense in it and funny how everyone was lumped in untill tonight right before the weekend so he could stack up all the money before monday when no one receives theyre orders but i bet if your ordered apb it shows! ya because its like $20 a gram. i feel bad for the guy who fe for a sheet of acid and will choke on my words when proven wrong but i doubt it.

				I have been following PE and this thread very closely for a while, as I was quite suspicious of this new &quot;amazing&quot; vendor. He asked me to FE as well, and I immediately replied saying there was no way I would ever FE for a new vendor who Ive never done business with before. I&nbsp; asked him that if he was not OK with this then to cancel my order. Then I checked my order and saw that he marked it in transit. I am pretty sure we are not going to be receiving anything.<br /><br />There were so many red flags but with 43 positive feedback I took a shot. Note to all the noobies, if it seems to good to be true, then it most certainly is. This scam has been around for too long on SR and I feel sorry for everyone who FE&#039;d without thinking twice. Escrow is here for a reason guys!<br /><br />I hope I am wrong but I certainly dont believe I am.

				So far FE&#039;s add up to over $2000 dollars in just a few hrs that i can total up and that is not including the 11 orders for roxies at $15 a piece no way to tell how many people bought per order but you can imagine people probably just didnt buy one at that price!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;so im guessing at least $2500 or more has been FE in a few hrs. Will watch and see how many more people fall prey to this! there is no way i feel really bad for the guy who FE for a sheet of lsd and god knows how many roxies, oh shit another FE for a full sheet, guy says i I hope he throws in a few extra for fe early I do to for you buddy. Chalk up another $375 in the bank for Planet. People dont do it!!!!! Keep this thread up front for people to know whats going down

				Well said Jackie, its easy to see the only thing anyone has ever gotten are orders less than $20 a piece, No COKE, no ketamine, no tar over .1 again $20 orders or less or little pip sized orders for apb, not to mention not one single hit of acid. everyone will know for sure on monday. The stats add up to bullshit. where are you planet gonna comment on this or see how far past $3000 your gonna make it. My guess is alot more. people dont be fooled

				Really?? Can&#039;t see any order received over $20? This thread has exposed a lot of questions about how this vendor does business. I love the freedom SR gives all of us but sometimes I wish there was a little more oversight by the wonderful people running the store. I know we mostly police ourselves but there has to be a point where someone steps in and says &quot;whoa, let&#039;s stop everything for a minute and look at what&#039;s going on here&quot; and make a determination if the vendor is on the up-and-up. It might save a bunch of people a bunch of money and inconvenience.

				Damn he only has (9)&nbsp; 1000 hit sheets of acid left available for sale at $2082 a pop, and hurry because there are only (18) 1/2oz lisitngs of his pure acetone washed coke at $650 a pop, 28 eightballs of ketamine 49 eightballs of Tar and dont forget the 1000 roxies. He has alot of product but cant handle waiting a few days, monday at the latest for our orders to arrive and then for everyone to pay him but, he has kingpin amounts of dope on hand but his total orders before he started requiring everyone to FE was probably less than $1000 total which built his rep on a handful of small penis amounts of apb&nbsp; which you can still order anywhere on the net easily, a few valiums, or single adderals for $11 a pop. Small time orders half of them are now FE&#039;d transactions. Nice scheme I was just hoping for a good tar connect for the low, no such thing to be had

				Feedback is all FE&#039;s (a bunch of them!) from today, then as you go back there is no feedback for a 3 day period, then all the feedback 4 days and older says nothing about FE. And DtownsFinest is right, all the old feedback is for .1 gram bth, 200mg of APB6 (or whatever it is). No large orders, 8 Balls, etc, show up on the review pages. Something just doesn&#039;t look right. And several reviewers spelled vendor as &quot;vender&quot;. That is weird. I&#039;m not going to make accusations as I have no facts and haven&#039;t ordered from them but to paraphrase Will.I.Am Shakespeare &quot;Something is rotten in the state of PlanetExpress.&quot;

				I&#039;m writing myself a reminder to come back here on Monday and see if you got your stuff. <br />The prices are soooo enticing! 1/2 oz of coke for $650?!?! I could almost fall for that. <br />The only time I ever actually ordered from someone with those kinds of prices I lost my money. Had to FE of course! Correction, I got taken twice. Once on BMR by the guy who was impersonating bcpltd and once on SR by some other douche. I have NEVER seen anyone get real coke at that price. Must have an awesome connection! <br />There is no feedback on the listings for 7g&#039;s of coke ($412) or 14g&#039;s of coke ($650). People aren&#039;t snatching it up at those prices? <br />Doesn&#039;t pass the smell test.

				God. Damn. It.<br /><br />I view my messages first, don&#039;t think it looks too suspicious, so I FE. THEN see his feedback has gone from 43 to 83 (all FE), THEN come here and you guys are the voice of reason. I feel so stupid for not coming here and reading first. I spent over 150$ on roxis that I questioned were legit in the first place now you guys don&#039;t even think I&#039;ll get them to ever know...<br /><br />SO being the newish buyer I am, once FE is clicked, NOTHING will ever get my money back, right? Even if it pans out that PE is a huge, elaborate scammer than fucked over half his customer base, nothing will be done to rectify things? <br /><br />I guess it will just end up being an expensive mistake that I will NEVER make again... <br /><br />What&#039;s really interesting is that there is NO sign of PE anywhere around to placate those (us) who are in need of some answers or just to appease our complaints.

				I put an order in for a g of his black tar. Then i got a message from him telling me that he has it all packed up and that i would need to FE before he sent it out to me. Needless to say, this was very dismaying.&nbsp; Official SR policy is directly against this. I don&#039;t want to start calling scammer at the moment but I believe I have earned respect to not have to FE especially with a vendor who has been here a month and has less than half than transactions that i have accumulated over almost 2 years. Then i see an avalanche of FE&#039;s on his feedback. Im waiting for his reply and don&#039;t know him that well but asking me to FE on my first transaction with him and then seeing all these FE&#039;s is putting bad thoughts in my head. If he can work this out with me then i will report back on this thread immediately but i would urge everyone to give a little more thought before they FE.&nbsp; Im not saying hes a scammer but this pattern is all too familiar for me. I will be back on here to apologize profusely if this works out.

				Before all these FE shit started appearing I was already suspect of this guy because all of his orders to me at first glance were small amounts of valium, and alot of apb sample sizes not much $ each which i thought was legal anyway? probably not now but onwards, i noticed all these great products in his listings which would appeal to many a customer and I thought what if his feedback was created by him or people tied to him or that and combo of a few legit orders of apb, and that in fact it was LEO gathering addresses and orders for legitimate hard drugs. That was my first paranoid thoughts about this guy. I thought i smelled shit, turns out there is a pony in the barn. Just the motive was FE and bail most likely with 5-10k when its all said and done. Not bad for a months work screwing around online building rep on minimal orders. Then going in for the slay!!!

				I think both Praetorian and MerckWebsterAmy are right and articulated exactly what i wanted to say while at the same time i would like to believe this isn&#039;t the case. If you don&#039;t have the product to be selling without the need for people to FE than you should rethink your logistics and come back ready to do this professionally. It reminds me of this guy from Spain who did the same thing( advertised an amazing deal then demanded everyone FE before he sent the order). I put in the order but i will not FE because why should I? I have never bought from them before and I have 4 times as many transactions as PlanetExpress and have spent well over $17k on SR. I have asked him to cancel my order so we&#039;ll see how it goes.

Apparently everyone must FE but you&#039;re only asking after the order is placed. Be straight up and put on your profile and the listings everyone has to FE to order. <br />I also noticed that you only began asking for FE about 3-4 days ago. All your reviews prior to that have no mention of FE. <br />You say you need to get coin to restock but you have like $100,000 worth of dope listed on your profile page. <br />These things don&#039;t add up so you should be able to understand why people are questioning your &quot;business plan&quot;.

				I can&#039;t help it...I have to laugh my ass off. PE is so blatantly not on the up-and-up (insanely low prices, massive inventory, no FE for 44 transactions and then ALL FE, puts order &quot;in transit (yeah right) and then says &quot;you have to FE&quot;) and then starts a thread on the forum asking for business and feedback. <br />He may as well have put up a neon sign saying &quot;If you&#039;re willing to give me your money, I&#039;m willing to take it&quot;.<br />And yet people hold out hope that they aren&#039;t getting scammed.

				I&#039;m really glad I didn&#039;t make the initial leap, and waited for others to share their experiences.<br /><br />Marking things in transit and then springing an FE requirement is HIGHLY suspicious, if not outright thuggish, behavior.&nbsp; Asking for the FE before marking in transit would be irregular and somewhat suspicious, but the part about having marked things in transit is beyond the pale.&nbsp; And then the vendor removing the link to this thread...well, yea...<br /><br />It&#039;s starting to become clear that this vendor does not do business the proper way.&nbsp; If you are in a position where you can&#039;t keep conducting business unless people FE, you need to scale back your business and get yourself a bankroll before trying to play with the big boys.&nbsp; <br /><br />And that&#039;s giving the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; My more cynical side tells me that the signs point to high risk of scam.&nbsp; It might even be that a number of people from this FE batch get product, in order to show that &quot;all is well&quot; even though the vendor sprung an FE requirement on buyers by holding their BTC hostage.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not sure how many waves I&#039;d expect that to keep up...<br /><br />Proceed with caution.

				Hi guys I contact PE he was very fast to answer I was about to place a larger order for BTH but I have not ready any feedback from anyone on quality ? did I miss something ?<br /><br />I guess I should just order a sample if its good quality it competes with dutch sellers #4 prices I am in , I have found the high on BTH to be very rich less clinical than afgani #4 salt but my experience is limited I also found that I had to use 1.5-2x by weight that works at his price the question is how strong and or clean is his TAR ?<br /><br />Thanks for any input <br /><br />GF

				@Gonefishin you shouldn&#039;t even buy a small amount. The vendor is not square. You may get your order if it&#039;s small enough but you may also get nothing or you may get something but not what you ordered. The word is people have gotten products that did not work as advertised. Even if this guy ships product it will take forever to get yours if you order now. Look at all the orders piling up on the feedback page and that&#039;s just the FEs! <br />This guy has a con of some sort going, don&#039;t waste your money.<br />There are lots of vendors who are reliable, trustworthy and committed to getting you high quality products.

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s nobody has reported him for such blatant Bait and Switchin&#039;, or that the mods just don&#039;t care. You seriously can&#039;t make people FE if it wasn&#039;t displayed clearly in your terms, and if that isn&#039;t one of the more major rule violations then I don&#039;t know what is.

If he can do that why does he need anyone to FE? He clearly has coin to get more product. Look at the amount of drugs and money on his listings. Who sells 14g of coke for $650? and you better hurry! There are only 48 left! The only thing I can say is I&#039;m glad PE started this topic. I bet it prevented even more people from losing money.

This guy has never seen a pound of weed on his life. SR MODS need to do something now he has not garnered the trust to be able to do this. My mouth is on the ground right now when i looked and saw how many more people have FE with this doueche!!! All I can do is say I told you so when the dust settles.

				ya he agreed to ship why not? he has nothing to loose, he may have some even auto finalize and get the cash in the meantime it makes it seem like all is well to curb posts on this thread but why take down the link??. he said mine was in transit after i said hell no to fe to him also. and the dummies who say 5/5 shipped quick because he marked it in transit they just too dumb to realize. If he were a real vendor he would be the best prices on SR for every item possible. No one has bud that cheap either, amazing how he came into lbs of multiple different starins all of a sudden as well. Ugh what an asswipe

				I think DPR or one the administrators should put a giant disclaimer on the front page of the SR homepage saying to never FE. Not enough newbs and other people never even make it to the forums and have no idea what the reputation is for some of the vendors. Cursory glances here on the forums could stop alot of the mischief that gets perpetrated(and could easily be avoided). PE has not read any of my messages after he asked me to FE and i saw that his transactions have gone up by 100 in the past day. my order has been processed and i wont be able to go to resolution for another 10 days so (fingers crossed) maybe he really will send it but i think most of us veterans know when a vendor starts acting like this, hes usually gone just as quickly.

As i said myself, once i receive the order i will be sure to let everyone know how legit you are. Some people don&#039;t have the patience but i think you will find that this forum is full of respectful and honest people. I wish you luck on your future endeavors.

				I do believe SR gets a commission on each sale. Does this mean that they now have 10% of every single one of those FE orders? If so, they should hold on to that so they can send it back when this guy dips town. Least you can do for letting this shitshow carry on.<br />

				The whole &quot;he may be legit, he just said I don&#039;t need to FE and that my order shipped.&quot; <br />I held onto that sliver of hope for about...60 seconds when I got that message yesterday. <br />Upon second thought, however, I&#039;m pissed. <br />I sent him a pretty angry message - and said &quot;Please cancel my order.&quot; <br />He said &quot;If you&#039;re going to order more bulk later, I&#039;ll ship without FE...just let me know what you want to do.<br />I immediately messaged back &quot;I&#039;ll cancel this time. If all goes well for you, I&#039;ll apologize and make my order later.&quot; <br />He said &quot;Too late. It already shipped.&quot; <br />But he JUST posted that that stuff wasn&#039;t getting shipped out until today. Did he run to the PO for mine only? <br />He&#039;s just buying time so he gets people like us who say &quot;Oh hey! He&#039;s sending mine without FE!&quot; so that more people will say &quot;Ohp. He must be legit then. Imma FE&quot; <br />I&#039;m sure some of these FE&#039;s aren&#039;t even real. If they are...I pity the guy that FE&#039;d on 14g of cocaine. <br />It&#039;s gonna be a fairly rough loss for you. <br /><br />I&#039;ve already promised these BTC to another vendor once they get out of escrow, because they will...because I won&#039;t be receiving this order. <br /><br />Whatever. <br /><br />And as far as &quot;SR should save that 10% because it&#039;s the least they can do for letting this carry on.&quot; <br /><br />No they shouldn&#039;t. You shouldn&#039;t ever FE. Ever. Even respected vendors that want FE for bulk - that&#039;s YOUR risk. Not SR&#039;s. They could not be more blatant about USE ESCROW FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

				I sincerely hope he follows through. He would get the most glowing review from me, honestly. <br />I&#039;ve picked up 1,000 hits locally for a similar price to what I just paid him, so it&#039;s certainly REASONABLE that he could post it at that price, make a much smaller profit - then just have a decent customer base because of a ton of stellar orders. <br /><br />My hopes just aren&#039;t high.

				I Google image searched his bud pic. It pops up in a couple dispensaries ads on weed maps.com same bud, same black leather background, even the little crumb on the right is there. If you download the pic from his listing, go to Google on a different&nbsp; comp or however you roll, then search by image, uploading planetexpress&#039;s pic when. It asks you to, the first result under visually similar images is the the one I&#039;m talking about. the top and bottom of the image is cut off, so you have to choose to go to the original page, find the pic in question, and click on it to expand it. then you will see it in its full glory.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have to admit, I&#039;m one of the stupid fucks who ordered first and used reason and logic second. I noticed a crap ton of &quot;Fe as requested&quot; feedback right before I ordered, so I did have the presence of mind to I told him in the address box that if he was going to ask someone with over 8k spent in 60 transactions, 0% auto f, 1% ($50) refund to FE, then he could fuck right off and cancel my order. it sucks to have my money tied up, and hey, you never know, miracles can &amp; do happen, put this would be on the level of Jesus tap dancing across the fucking pacific for one entity to have access to all those drugs, in those quantities @ those prices..... And he needs folks with a $17 order to fe? <br /><br />PE, if, in fact you are drug Jesus, I&#039;d like to apply to be a disciple. I&#039;ll blindly follow you and absolve myself of all earthly possessions. If, like the other Jesus, you&#039;re a fucking scam, I hope you die from an overdose or other drug related death, preferably with drugs you bought with btc earned from scamming here. Poetic, I know.

				My small part in this mounting scandal ha....Ordered a point of tar got it when it was super cheap (low something like&nbsp; .095 BTC)&nbsp; early last week. At that time he only had USPS for shipping options but I am north of the border. FE&#039;d upon request, (since it was only .095 BTC after all, but maybe still not smart..). Anyways, noticed later he now had shipping for outside us for almost .04 bitcoins more than I paid. Msg&#039;d PE to see if this causes me a prob, and admin promptly replied that he wasn&#039;t concerned about a few dollars....All communication pleasant thus far. Let&#039;s see how it plays out this week....I have a feeling this will either all go really well, or really bad :-| !

(baiting)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Vendor posts up listings at 1/2 the prices of the next-cheapest vendor in every category, making no mention of a &#039;need&#039; or &#039;requirement&#039; to FE in neither their Vendor Profile, nor their Listings. (baiting)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Contradictory to 1.&nbsp; Vendor gets orders, but then tells buyers they need to FE before he&#039;ll ship their order, because they have &quot;low stats&quot; or because they are &quot;too new&quot; ... (clearly he baited in buyers, specifically newbie buyers with cheap listings and NO mention of FE before any buyer made their purchase - buyer/escrow trap)<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Some buyers want to cancel their order, and instead of doing so Vendor takes his dear sweet time responding, only to promise them they will receive &quot;extra&quot; if they don&#039;t cancel, and just FE ... (employs an &#039;impatience&#039; PsyOp, followed by feeding their greed with empty promises)<br /><br />5. Flooding in feedback of people apparently vouching for the vendor&#039;s truthworthiness and promotion of the communities &quot;willingness to FE&quot; by example whilst not a single person who HAS &#039;FE&#039;d has come forward saying that this silly action paid off.&nbsp; Despite feedback that would lead anyone to believe that people have FE&#039;d and received several times in the past (going by the willy nilly-ness of the feedback comments)<br /><br />6. After a lot of hype surrounding the FE&#039;s and feedback legitimacy, the vendor posts bulk MMJ listings at an unheard of price:quality ratio worth thousands of dollars. (last stitch effort to do damage to the community when reputation is already in question)<br /><br />Does this sound like I&#039;m talking about PlanetExpress? Because I&#039;m talking about Synaptic. Verbatim.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DO NOT BUY!

				so this human vagina has disappeared from his own forum thread? i really wanted to give him a chance even though i should have know better. what i don&#039;t understand is how people are still FE&#039;ing with him and no one from SR seems to be stopping it. I placed an order with him more than a week ago, refused to FE when he asked, then he told me he sent it and i should expect it by wednesday(which i don&#039;t understand why it would take so long). its disheartening that DPR and site admins continue to allow this type of stuff to continue to happen. i can go back to posts of mine from last feb. or march(2012) where this same scheme was occurring. as has been mentioned before(by me and i know some others), all that FE money should go into a separate account that can only be accessed by some SR affiliated person. whatever i guess. ill get my $ back because i didn&#039;t FE but its a shame so many people got took. mercy DPR :&#039;(

				Damn dude how are your first 5 transactions unsuccessful? Did you FE on all of them and not receive anything? Just only order from vendors with really high ratings and have been around for a while. Don&#039;t let pieces of shit like him make you think that this is common, at least 95% of vendors are legit.

				His last actual feedback is kinda a while back..I mean come on people, usps is not that slow...they can be here and there, sure. <br />But priority mail, mailed Thursday, is in most places Saturday.

				Do whatever you can to get whatever amount of money back if that is possible.&nbsp; Tell him you will leave it at 5 for one hour and if you don&#039;t have half your money back, you&#039;re changing it again.&nbsp; Then, when/if he does give you half back, change it immediately.&nbsp; Vendors can never take money out of your account.

				Well I lost 2 coins with this guy. I ordered 6 days ago, and I didn&#039;t see any negative feedback at the time. He asked me to FE and I after I saw some of his past feedback on deliveries, I thought ok, he&#039;s probably for real. The lesson I&#039;ve learned is you have to think like a scammer to protect yourself. Of course you would establish a brief period of successful sales, and then reappear for the big steal. The big steal was all his actions over the past 7 days, And I&#039;m sure some of those orders were big. I&#039;m a great fan of SR, and I guess I had to pay a couple hundred to now become a better buyer, I&#039;ve accepted this and I&#039;m moving on. Now lets not FE on any other shit and get this site back in balance!<br />NT

				Thank God I read some feedback before I just got a message from PE asking me to FE so he could reup quicker and keep prices lower. He messaged me less than an hour after I placed my order.<br /><br />Does anyone know how this will work now that I placed the order and my payment is in escrow? I am sure he isn&#039;t going to ship me anything, but is there any way to get my bitcoins back without waiting the 17 days and going through the hassle? Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br />

				He scammed me out of almost 4 coins, really sucks but lesson learned. I FE&#039;d based off his older positive feedback before the flood of page after page of FE and crazy inventory. I am relatively new and most of my other sellers requested FE as well which I did and got the orders without issue so it didn&#039;t seem like it was an unusual request at the time.<br /><br />He also messaged me saying he would send back half of my Coins in good faith until my order arrived, but said I had to change my feedback first. I did and also told him he had 2 hours to send the coins or it was going back to a feedback of 1. Well after changing it of course I don&#039;t hear anything back from him or see any coins. I don&#039;t think he intends to send anyone anything back, it&#039;s just a last ditch effort to clean up his feedback for another day or two so he can get a bunch of others to buy before he&#039;s completely done.

				What is happening to Silk Road? Why are people FE&#039;ing on huge orders from a guy with no record of legitimate sales? I&#039;ve been looking at some orders STILL coming in for hundreds and hundreds of dollars that people FE&#039;d for. I don&#039;t mean to be a dick, I know I&#039;d be really upset if I were one of you right now, but Silk Road advises people to never FE, period. If you are going to FE (which I have a personal policy of never doing) you better make sure that a vendor NOT ONLY has a good overall score, but has comments and threads showing that people have been trusting this person and have been receiving packages. When you FE, you need to understand, your money is now gone; you don&#039;t have it, SR doesn&#039;t have it... the vendor has it. So if that vendor didn&#039;t send your package or it got lost, there is nothing you or anyone can definitively do. I feel bad for people but come on guys! Even for a trusted vendor with a good reputation, if one day he changes his payment policy to FE for everyone, and all of a sudden his trusted buyers are FE&#039;ing for hundreds and thousands of dollars, what makes you think this guy isn&#039;t quitting the game and didn&#039;t figure he might as well end it with some very easy, quick cash? Use your heads. This system is good, but it isn&#039;t perfect and it never will be. I really am sorry to all of you, but it&#039;s increasingly looking like your money is gone. I&#039;m assuming we have a lot of newbies, because people used to know better.

				This will go down in SR history. Let this be a lesson to future SR users. Even if PE turns out to be a fully legit vendor who is having legit shipping delays (lol) this episode should be a wake up call against FEing.

				ETM, lucydrop, tony76, jimmy buffet,&nbsp; i can list a bunch more&nbsp; scammers that many of us warned SR about and SR waited until they made off with a shit load of BTC before SR acted.. I can agree on one point that you cant stop morons from FEing, but SR can limit the amount a vendor can have in FE&#039;s and his listings freeze when he exceeds that. a vendor can have as many orders in escrow as they want. but when you see 5 pages of FE and the forums are lit up with no orders being received thats BS...many of the buyers are domestic and it dont take 8 days to get a letter. i have received stuff from Germany, UK and canada in 7 days.&nbsp; &nbsp;the other idea is to limit the amount of FEs a vendor can ask for in a weeks time. than they lose it for a week... by than most orders should be received within 14 days.&nbsp; If SR has the smarts to develop SR, finding a way to curb this kind of abuse should be easy.<br />

Use your SR superiority to buy same Xanax. <br /><br />I actually agreed with most of what you said until you contradicted yourself and made light of me thinking there are too many rules when you admitted it took you six months to get yourself to a point where you were ready to order. As for the &quot;butthurt&quot; part, I guess I would have hurt feelings if I was 17 and you were the cool kid in class.&nbsp; <br /><br />You seem to keep forgetting that this forum is for people to learn to use SR the right way, which I have done thus far having my first 6-7 orders go great and even in this incident not FEing due to my research through this forum. If you want to keep boasting how you rule and others drool, I would suggest going to another forum because you will just continue to get frustrated with newbies as this is a NEWBIE forum. Now that&#039;s a proper use of caps - pointing out something that is obvious to most but not to the very ignorant.<br /><br />I feel bad for the guys taken through PE, because I have had similar experiences through going to concerts and buying fake years ago, and then through Topix once the internet selling became prevalent. I am a wiser man now, and I hope to help those trying to recognize scammers rather than acting like a pompous ass like you.&nbsp; <br /><br />With regards to PE, I fully admit this was a classic case of &quot;if it seems too good to be true, it probably is...&quot; and for that I am kicking myself. Pricing that low should have been a major red flag, but my greed got the best of me. Just glad I knew not to FE, no matter how good the deal appeared to be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				@browncat <br /><br />not sure if you got your question answered but in the case of a scam you will get a %100 refund. The %50 is only in the case of a legit vendor actually sending u something and it gets intercepted or not delivered when its not your fault. You will get all your money back when this deuchebag gets the banhammer.

				I looked at PE listings at first and thought they were too good to be true. I almost pulled the trigger and bought but once I saw that he required FE without posting it on his vendor page I decided against it. I am so glad I waited to watch this unfold. <br /><br />After watching this thread develop I will never FE for a vendor who does not specify it on their page. I feel terrible for people who got scammed but at the same time they are dumb for trusting this vendor who just so happens to carry all drugs at very very low prices. But for some reason people are still buying from him! More people need to read the forums.

				I briefly thought about buying some acid off PE, but then my instincts kicked in and told me his prices were too good to be true.

				I also thought that it was a odd that PE had zero pictures of his various items. Even having a stock photo from google would be more legit than his logo on every page. I think it shows that all his listings were rushed. I doubt people order large amounts of meth or&nbsp; blow without looking at a real picture to judge the quality. But maybe I am wrong.

				Right there with you guys. Did not FE. Sucks because I was one of the legitimate buyers of his samples he sent out, so I thought, &quot;Great! He got more 6-apb and look at those cheap ass roxi!! How does PE sell so low?&quot; <br /><br />Now I know he sent out those samples just to garner false reputation and scam. Rule of thumb, no matter what your stats are, NEVER FE! If the vendor messages you asking to FE, then message back saying I do not FE. If you must cancel my order, do so, but I will not FE and promise to Finalize upon receipt. <br /><br />So, I am waiting for the timer to count down to go into resolution. Sucks because I have had perfect transaction stats until this guy. Now he is going to tarnish my purchasing stats. Hopefully SR staff can eliminate this from my stats and refund my BTC in full, unless he can provide legitimate tracking information (HA!)<br /><br />Never FE guys!

				I feel for everyone who got scammed, these scams are getting more and more complex. It&#039;s easy to understand someone who isn&#039;t a regular forum user could get roped into a FE after seeing 100% vendor rating and a few hundred transactions. Not too long ago I too lived under the assumption that all SR vendors were screened and legit after losing a quarter pound I learned my lesson and lurked the forums prior purchase until creating this account.

				I bought from someone before where they just marked several orders in transit then disappeared from SR.&nbsp; I had to go to resolution and got my money back and nothing was ever put on my purchasing stats since it was obviously a vendor issue.&nbsp; I would hope stats wouldn&#039;t be affected by this guy either since he obviously never sent anything.

				I ordered on sat night. Looked and reviews which &quot;looked&quot; legit and didn&#039;t have an issue FE since I only ordered about $100 worth. This guy is a clear scam but he did it well. I put some of the blame on myself but damn he was pretty slick.&nbsp; Ofcourse I&#039;m pissed I lost BTC but I know better for the future. What really pissede off is that he is still doing it and getting away with it. He had to been reported over 100 times and it is now apparent what he is/has pulled but the mods aren&#039;t doing anything to stop him. He has clearly broken a rule if not many so why is he still allowed to pull this shady shit? I haven&#039;t ventured onto any other markets but the lack of moderation is pushing me to see what else is out there... Sure a refund would be nice but i clearly fucked up by FE so live and learn And be thankful it wasn&#039;t a large amount I lost...<br /><br />Fuck PE!

				Hey hey, new to the road, &#039;seasoned&#039; IRL, I&#039;ve been hoping that this was a scam and not possible LE, chalk it up to paranoia. I ordered when he only had a small amount of listings, at a cost that seemed to me, standard street level prices, and therefor a very viable and realistic business strategy. (Shame on me for miscalculating human altruism). I&#039;m very happy he has been suspended, if only on principal. Been burned in real life enough times to know it can get far worse than losing money, take any set-back as a lesson and it won&#039;t be a total loss. Never gamble what you can&#039;t afford to lose. Don&#039;t FE, and don&#039;t front faceless criminals money in the real world. Sorry for waxing philosophic first post. DPR= Hero.&nbsp;

				Well,&nbsp; It&#039;s disheartening to say the least to sit here and read up on this.&nbsp; I placed my order with this douche canoe 6 days ago and immediately received this message. <br /><br />&quot;PlanetExpress &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your order is ready to be shipped! We kindly ask that you finalize the order early because you are a new buyer and/or have a high refund rate. The order will ship as soon as you finalize.&quot;<br /><br />I have had a couple of vendors asked me to do the same, read many positive reviews and fe&#039;d and received my package in quality fast time. I didn&#039;t think twice at the time FEing with this guy as he had plenty of good reviews, I know if I would have seen anything remotely incriminating, I would never have ordered.&nbsp; &nbsp;Was his listing low?&nbsp; yeah,&nbsp; but not unreasonable if someone had a large quantity looking to unload.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a huge event I&#039;m attending this weekend and with zero red flags I went ahead and FE. 4 coins worth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, My package never arrived.&nbsp; just logged in to message him and his profile is gone, and here I am. <br /><br />I&#039;m more pissed that i don&#039;t have my product 3 days before this event.&nbsp; Money,&nbsp; I&#039;ll make more.... If he needed my $$$ that bad, take it..... Karma is a fucking CUNT and he will get his.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not worried.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are some great vendors out there..... shame on me for FE.&nbsp; I can tell you this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendors you want my $$$&nbsp; No more FE.&nbsp; &nbsp; My opinion,&nbsp; &nbsp;SR needs to immediately remove any listing from any vendor that asks to FE.&nbsp; &quot;I trust you, you trust me&quot; doesn&#039;t fly. <br /><br />oh Well... Shit happens.&nbsp; Live and learn<br /><br /><br />

				The hole &quot;and or&quot; bit didn&#039;t raise a massive red flag as is clearly a mass generic msg as doesn&#039;t state your position <br /><br />SR do say dont FE and when you do its all on you there are rules about new vendors asking for FE thats why no listings said anything about FE then they msg everyone saying &quot;generic mass produce unspecific copy paste you need to FE&quot;

				&nbsp;:o Good morning all! I&#039;m not going to say it!&nbsp; :-X&nbsp; Not gonna do it!<br /><br />OKAY! Lol! Why do y&#039;all FE? R ya retarded? I have been on The Road here since 2011! The only reason I have blown over ฿14,000 here is because of the &#039;Escrow&#039; protection! In all that time and closing on 60 packages I have never lost a dime! <br /><br />DON&#039;T EVER FINALIZE PAYMENT BEFORE IT IS IN YOUR HOT GRUBBY LITTLE HANDS! Finalize immediately after it&#039;s there, but NOT BEFORE! God damnit all!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I have been asked to FE a dozen times and each time I said no thank you and took them off my list for life! They may have had the best what ever that ever will be, but what separates a recreational user of ANY drug and what is known better as a &#039;junkie&#039; is that you don&#039;t act like one! Finalizing early is just weak and shows the vendor right from the get go - that you&#039;re a junkie and they treat you accordingly - eventually!<br /><br />I ordered from PlanetExpress for my first time Saturday. The next day I got the &#039;&#039;we ask that you finalize for the shipped order early ....&#039; bs and knew instantly that they just tied up my coins. 6 more days to resolution to get my coins back. Shrug? Better than loosing them!<br /><br />You are never showing respect to a vendor by finalizing early.&nbsp; You&#039;re fucking yourself and them! Escrow was and has been in place from the concept of Silk Road to protect you and the vendor. FE should be outlawed!<br /><br />Sorry bout your losses - any/all of ya! But I have been preaching to NOT fall for that one for going on years now and still the pages of what ever thread you read are full of angry ripped off people that ignore advice from veteran buyers and Silk Road management! <br /><br />I sorta give up ...&nbsp; &nbsp;???&nbsp; .. but next time you feel like FE&#039;ing for any stupid reason - just send your coins to me and than that way at least one of us will be happy!<br /><br />Love ya!<br /><br />oZ&nbsp; 8)

				Here is an interesting PM I got from PlanetExpress when I ordered a 0.1 of BTH from him when he first started (I was the fifth person to &#039;get a sample&#039;&quot;.&nbsp; Here is the message he sent me when I questioned why it hadn&#039;t arrived 12 days after sending priority:<br /><br />Message 1:<br />&quot;PlanetExpress I packed your sample in a priority flat rate box using a $5.60 prepaid stamp. I dropped it in a blue box, later to discover that flat rate priority envelopes cost $5.60, whereas the flate rate boxes cost $5.80, so its very likely that USPS never sent it out due to the $0.20 discrepancy.&quot;<br />Message 2:<br />&quot;PlanetExpress Ok so what happened was that your package was not even sent out by USPS because I placed a $5.60 pre-paid priority stamp onto a flate rate priority box, later to realize that the boxes cost $5.80, whereas the envelopes cost $5.60. This was a complete screw-up on my end and isn&#039;t something that would effect you. I do apologize immensely for this, and I want all of my customers to be completely satisfied, so I will ship you another sample as soon as my listings are up, just message me and I&#039;ll do another CL.&quot;

				Many people, myself included, posted many many times on this thread before the scheme crashed and warned everyone this vendor had SCAM written all over him. There were warning signs galore and just a little common sense would have saved many people having their money tied up (best case scenario) or their money lost (worst case). Instead people continued to order form the douchebag because the deal was &quot;too good to be true&quot;. <br /><br />If you aren&#039;t going to listen to the little voice in your head at least listen to the people on this forum who posted REASONS for not dealing with PE, not feelings but fact based reasons. It was obvious this was a scam and I feel badly for those who lost money, but if you read this thread shortly after it was created and still FE&#039;d then I don&#039;t feel badly for you. You were warned but chose to throw your money away anyway and proved the age old saying &quot;there&#039;s a sucker born every minute&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a sucker again. DON&#039;T FE!!!!!!!, DO YOUR RESEARCH AND LISTEN TO THOSE WHO LEARNED THE HARD WAY. IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, THEN IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. DON&#039;T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY, IF YOU REALLY DON&#039;T NEED IT PLEASE SEND IT TO ME!

				It sucks i put my order into resolution 2 days ago and im still waiting, why the heck arent SR admins getting on this considering this is a special case which they clearly know was a massive scam why hold up our money any longer!! Also will i be getting by BTC back or $ value at the time i bought it? At this point i stand to gain a little bit $ money wise if i get the same BTC back. whats even more ridiculous is i got the automated letter warning me its been past 10 days and a reminder to release funds if i got my item! How stupid! So does this mean i still have to ride out another 3 days or so for the full 17 days since i placed the order and it was placed into transit?? They should just automatically refund everyone who has a pending order with hims money back and especially if they have already made a resolution claim!! I could use that BTC with legitimate vendors right now. Damn i never want to get myself in this situation ever again it takes way too long to get your money back what a headache. Does make me realize not to make risky deals with people, including spending more than your willing to loose overseas, ordering a new product from a vendor who has never sold it before has even the possibility of looking like they screw up orders from time to time etc. Im only going with for sure vendors from now on, pay the price and get the goods as expected and save the headache. lesson learned, glad my bs sensors went off when he asked me to FE as i was one the of first few to be asked. Only two people had FE&#039;d when i brought it to the forums attention and promptly told him to shove the FE up his a**. Well i didnt put it like that but i said dude you say im new havent proven myself? I had already looked at his previous sales and was already suspect before he asked me to FE so when he pulled that number i said hell no you have no track record even if SR makes it appear that you have some rep, i looked already and saw he barely had sold $300 total worth of confirmed sales at that point. Fu%*ing guy bought himself a new kia with the money he made off with in a weekend. Kinda makes me not like the new review system as it was easy for me to look at every deal he had done at that point and i knew exactly every deal he had done on a few pages, now you get like 4 reviews on one page that are all over the board and really arent very helpful in the first place. Ok im gonna stop talking im clearly high and going on a tangent at this point.

He would get the most glowing review from me, honestly. <br />I&#039;ve picked up 1,000 hits locally for a similar price to what I just paid him, so it&#039;s certainly REASONABLE that he could post it at that price, make a much smaller profit - then just have a decent customer base because of a ton of stellar orders. <br /><br />My hopes just aren&#039;t high. I&#039;m not worried that I&#039;ll lose my money - either I&#039;ll get my order, be elated - and be a repeat customer. <br /><br />Or he&#039;ll run off, SR will return my money from escrow - and I&#039;ll only have wasted my time. <br />He tells me my order will be here Wednesday, so I don&#039;t have too long to wait to see what&#039;s up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Listen, insisting that you&#039;ll give him a good review is not going to make him send you something if he has nothing to send, and no intent to send it -to begin with. <br /><br />I know everyone likes to hope that the &quot;too good to be true&quot; prices are &quot;true&quot; but, sadly, they&#039;re not.<br /><br />Everyone on SR would give this guy &quot;an outstanding review&quot; if he &quot;came through&quot; with Lbs for 1/2 price, and sheets for $200, and roxies for $15 each.&nbsp; But that&#039;s all just very unrealistic.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s he telling you? This is promotional price?&nbsp; That the prices will come up soon?&nbsp; Is that why he&#039;s adding more and more under-priced listings in EVERY category?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;So this ONE guy knows where to get EVERY drug cheap enough to completely UNDERCUT everyone on SR?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doubt it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually, a lot of vendors offer their supplies for VERY VERY cheap when they first join.

It&#039;s called competition. The prices can be too good to be true sometimes, but that doesn&#039;t mean that all vendors are out to scam you.

He sells in .1g increments and requires FE and he has never let any buyer down. The guy is as trustworthy as they come, his feedback is like 14 pages long, all FE and all filled. I have 4 transactions with him and all have been perfect in every respect. When it comes to FE with him I have no hesitation. However he is an exception, in most cases you are correct; if someone asks you to FE there is a good chance you won&#039;t get your order.
