				Title: <strong>SR weed Questions</strong><br />

				Question for all you weedies!&nbsp; :) I want to know everyones impression of weed quality versus pricing on SR. I&#039;ve seen some people complaining that they are paying too much for junk weed and I&#039;ve heard that $60/8th is too much for top self SR bud. So, I guess I am really wondering is what price do you expect to pay on SR for bud and for what quality? Hell, lets go one further and everyone name your favorite strain of Bud! ;D

				$60/eighth is the going price from a lot of the dispensaries on the west coast (Cali) for high grade stuff. And those you have to actually drive to. you don&#039;t have the convenience of getting it delivered to your house (unless it is a delivery service).. now keep that and add the risk factor of being a vendor and dropping off illegal drug packages at your post office every day, and you are actually getting a killer deal for $60/eighth if it is high grade quality meds.. Everything should be priced according to the meds potency, look and smell.. so you really can&#039;t tell if it is a good price for the product until you get it and try it yourself.

				Pricing and quality really depends on what you&#039;re used to. <br /><br />Where I am, we aren&#039;t near any legalized state, and there really isn&#039;t any &quot;variety&quot;. You get what you get. Either really good shit or mid-grade seedy shit. The good shit could be indica, could be sativa. Who knows. It&#039;s just whatever happens to be &quot;in stock&quot; with the local dealer. And here, good/medical goes for an average of $110-$125/quarter. <br /><br />On SR, you get your preference of what kind of weed you want. I especially like the vendors that allow you to &quot;Mix-And-Match&quot; strains.<br /><br />From what I have seen on the vendors that I am using, is that 1/8 or 1/4 really isn&#039;t that great of a deal. Almost about the same as what you&#039;re going to pay &quot;street prices&quot; once you factor in the shipping. However, moving up to 1/2oz-1oz at a time is a significant &quot;discount&quot;. Like I said, an OZ would run about $440+ on the streets here and I can get an oz of medical shit for about $320 here. <br /><br />As far as favorite bud, ALL OF THEM! lol. OGKush, Bubba Kush, Purple Skunk, Sour Diesel. Alaskan Thunder Fuck, etc. ALL OF THEM! I like to have an array of both sativa and indica depending on what I am using it for. If I want to get high and work on a project or something, sativa. Want to smoke a bowl and get knocked on your ass and stuck to your couch? Indica. <br /><br />
