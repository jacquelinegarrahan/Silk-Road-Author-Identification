				You can see pictures of the huge crystals he sends me on my actual methylone listing.<br />The quality is amazing, and everyone that gets it from me says its unbelievably strong!<br />This supplier ships EMS and you get a tracking the day of paying and it arrives in 5 - 7 days to USA / rest of world.<br /><br />Stop letting drg0nzo swindle your cash for so much profit when you can have the direct source, or become a drg0nzo of your own!

				The supplier also re-ships 100 % if the order was not successfully delivered, however his stealth is amazing and out of 25+ bulk methylone orders I&#039;ve never had to ask for a re-ship.

				<br />Sounds to good to be true. Why does this guy not sell shit of SR? He would make a mint. He accepts BTC, His stealth is good, offers a 100% Reship. And sells kilo&#039;s for $1700. And then also sells loads of other drugs. He would be the best got dam vendor here.<br /><br />

				Add me to the list of people being ripped off by SamGiancana. luckily mine is just an attmept right now as I did not F/E luckily(only because I already fell for that and got ripped of twice by smooth talkers. no more) and He pulled the exact same Shtick as everyone else. first a fake usps tracking # (for a domestic order explain that one) then a message saying someone hacked his account and to resend info and he would get the real tracking # . from here he ignores every message/email and order was about to auto finalize so I put it into resoloution, just waiting on that now. <br />Man this guy is something else, so nice and sincere to begin with . and tons of people are F/E for his generous 20% extra from a &quot;trusted and stand up vendor&quot; i cant believe this<br />they really need to look at revising the rules for F/E, maybee abolish it for trusted buyers or something I dont know but the scams are getting bad.<br />

				Heres my speculation. The poster that offered the link for a price will pass you a msn/skype typical for the chinese to use. all this poster has to do is to create a fake account send you the details and you believe your talking to the methylone vendor:<br /><br />convo would be something like this:<br /><br />buyer: hi<br />chink: hello<br />buyer: do you have methylone for sale and can ship to usa or uk?<br />chink: ya of course sir:) we send 1000000000000kg per hour to your country.<br />buyer: wow<br />chink: yes yes<br />buyer: how much per kg?<br />chink 1700 usd<br />buyer: payment method<br />chink: wu<br /><br />now you could be paying for something he wants.<br /><br />me personally have loads of suppliers, but i wouldnt sell them. id be a mediator. or synthesize it one of our labs. You can only help to an extent when money is involved.<br /><br />And most, id say 70% of the good chineese manufacturers have now stopped doing Rcs. All you will get is underground nearly non english speaking vendors.<br /><br />Mike is one who still sells methylone. but his is the powdered form, and it gets stopped at customs he dont give a shit. He might label it as vanillin. the crystalline form is the only re dosable one which you wont find.

The poster that offered the link for a price will pass you a msn/skype typical for the chinese to use. all this poster has to do is to create a fake account send you the details and you believe your talking to the methylone vendor:<br /><br />convo would be something like this:<br /><br />buyer: hi<br />chink: hello<br />buyer: do you have methylone for sale and can ship to usa or uk?<br />chink: ya of course sir:) we send 1000000000000kg per hour to your country.<br />buyer: wow<br />chink: yes yes<br />buyer: how much per kg?<br />chink 1700 usd<br />buyer: payment method<br />chink: wu<br /><br />now you could be paying for something he wants.<br /><br />me personally have loads of suppliers, but i wouldnt sell them. id be a mediator. or synthesize it one of our labs. You can only help to an extent when money is involved.<br /><br />And most, id say 70% of the good chineese manufacturers have now stopped doing Rcs. All you will get is underground nearly non english speaking vendors.<br /><br />Mike is one who still sells methylone. but his is the powdered form, and it gets stopped at customs he dont give a shit. He might label it as vanillin. the crystalline form is the only re dosable one which you wont find.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+ 1 Karma<br /><br />Blatant Scam.

				&quot;I wouldn&#039;t deal in x,xxx digits for minimal profit.&quot;<br />- ScamGiancana<br /><br />I suspect that your profit margin is somewhat higher than that of legitimate vendors in that you simply steal the customer&#039;s payment, with none of that pesky overhead of actual product and shipping.<br />In short Sam, you are a thief and a liar. Anyone who has interest in taking Mr. Giancana&#039;s offer should first scan the forums for the many postings by customers who have been ripped off by him, such as myself.<br />Caveat emptor.

I want to make sure i am not being misleading...<br />.<br />These are the last two purchases of bit coins:<br />.<br />Amount Received 1.60 BTC<br />From Coinbase (transfers@coinbase.com)<br />To You<br />Date May 02, 2013, at 06:02pm PDT<br />Status Complete<br />Notes<br /><br />Paid for with $210.93 from Bank of the West - Bank xxxxx7473.<br />.<br />Amount Received 0.40 BTC<br />From Coinbase (transfers@coinbase.com)<br />To You<br />Date May 02, 2013, at 06:04pm PDT<br />Status Complete<br />Notes<br /><br />Paid for with $53.31 from Bank of the West - Bank xxxxx7473.<br />.<br />So if pricem did not go down the nalance should have been $264.. Us<br /><br />this is balance of my coinbase wallet after transfer completed:<br />.<br />Balance: 2.12251506 BTC ≈ 221.03 USD ***** so it looks like I lost about 40 dollars<br />.<br />Here is my transfer to sr:<br />.<br />Amount Sent 2.1124 BTC<br />From You<br />To 1MiQrdBcabm4NFTz2FGMmS7VNW9nhFmEru<br />Date May 02, 2013, at 06:27pm PDT<br />.<br />I will buy 1 gram plus shipping and send the balance to you.. and just to make sure..

I need it here by next tuesday at the latest) it will be about 2 bitcoins i will .. they bc priced dropped like $30 per BC since i ordered i was planning on buying 2 grams so i think i will only be able to order 1 gram plus shipping... unless u know of another way to order.<br /><br /><br />thnx again for your feedback 3 days read<br />delete<br />SamGiancana(96) Ok cool!<br />What amount of bitcoin?<br />I&#039;ll work out a generous custom amount for your first order! 3 days read<br />delete<br />clpicard Thanks sam . have to wait an hour for coinbase then transfer to sr<br /><br />.<br />From Coinbase (transfers@coinbase.com)<br />To You<br />Date April 27, 2013, at 05:39pm PDT<br />Status Pending Your BTC will arrive on Thursday May 2, 2013 around 06:38PM PDT after the bank transfer has completed.<br />.<br />then will place order<br />.<br />glad to do business with you 3 days read<br />delete<br />SamGiancana(96) the .35 is approx 2 days<br />the other is approx 4 days<br />regular probably 5 - 6 days<br /><br />I&#039;ll package your order right now if you FE for 20 % more and get it done!<br /><br />Yeah screw the teflondon guy... I don&#039;t even like thinking about that shit!<br />Thanks for the business brother! 3 days read<br />delete<br />clpicard Hi Sam. I have read your posts and other peoples feedback in the forums. You seem like a very stand up and professional person. I .. like u .. was ripped off by teflon don.. THE BASTARD.. sorry u lost so much...and in another transaction the product was terrible.. so I am a bit gun shy with Fe. I think I will take a chance with you though and FE. I have a question for US tracking for .35 bc is that the same as express mail? How fast will it take to get to san jose california? If i do regular shipping with Fe how long will that take to get to san jose , ca. finally if i do Fe early how do u know so that I get 20% more??? do i put in feedack Fe early for 20% extra??<br />.<br />Thanks for your time,<br />.<br />clpicard 3 days read<br />delete<br />&lt; 1 2<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />
