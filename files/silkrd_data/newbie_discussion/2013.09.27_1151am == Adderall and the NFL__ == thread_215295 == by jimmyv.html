				You see reports all over of NFL players failing a piss test coming up hot for amps. Their excuse? I have ADD and take adderall. Lots of ADD within the NFL!! So it begs the question is adderall just the scapegoat for something else they&#039;re taking and if so what is it? Any ideas or is it really adderall for performance?

				No, it actually is adderall. If you have ever played sports on adderall it actually does help a lot. You are way more focused and &quot;in the zone&quot;

				I don&#039;t doubt they use the stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;ve played basketball on adderall and it def. gave me a boost.&nbsp; I was so jacked up.&nbsp; It&#039;s the L-amp in adderall that does it.&nbsp; It causes your adrenal gland to pump out the adrenaline that you&#039;d normally need as your &quot;fight or flight&quot; response.&nbsp; And on any given Sunday it&#039;s all about fighting or flighting around that football field.&nbsp; Adderall could potentially be used in any sport or any activity.&nbsp; Hell even a chess master would probably benefit from some adderall.&nbsp; The problem I have with adderall, and I do have lots of experience as it&#039;s one of my favorite drugs, is that you&#039;re just wreaking havoc on your body.&nbsp; When you stop taking the stuff you&#039;ll be a zombie.&nbsp; A complete vegetable.&nbsp; You will have trouble experiencing happiness and the fatigue is the worst.&nbsp; Expect to have zero energy for awhile.&nbsp; This all depends of course on how much you were taking and for how long.&nbsp;

				&#039;SmokesHisBroccoli&#039; is not kidding!!! I&#039;ve been prescribed 60mg&#039;s/day for over 2 years now and have been recently &quot;misusing&quot; them a bit... we&#039;ll say and running out by the end of the month - I&#039;m literally a useless lump of human flesh without them now.

If you take too much then it has the opposite effect.<br /><br />A ton of ADHD in the NFL? I doubt it very much. I&#039;ve never been diagnosed with ADHD, but I love me some Addys&nbsp; ;D
