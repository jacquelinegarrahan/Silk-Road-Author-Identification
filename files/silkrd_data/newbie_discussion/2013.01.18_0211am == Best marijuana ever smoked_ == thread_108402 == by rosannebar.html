				How about the best maryjane you ever smoked in your life?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Best on Sr?<br /><br />When I was younger one of my friends brought some brown ish pot from some other state.&nbsp; &nbsp; Literally smoked a joint or two, went to bed, woke up hours and hours later and was still literally high as a kite.&nbsp; &nbsp;No clue what strain it was, but I have never smoked anything that strong since.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think I&#039;m a kush kind of a person, I want the couch lock stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have heard about one hit shiznit,&nbsp; but I have never actually smoked any that one hit and I was high to the point of stopping.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wbu?

				Some years ago me and a friend went to amsterdam to find the best tasting smoke of our choice - ive never really been a weed smoker since i live in a country where hash has been mostly available the past 50 years..<br />But the strain that spooked out to us mostly was a budha cheese from barneys farm - best flavor ever but i believe that says alot more about the grower than the strain..<br />Ever since ive grown my own herb.. much cheeper :)

				Bought a QP of a Durban x Maui cross from a Mendo hippie. Beautifully done, I can still remember the smell and taste of the bud. Close second would be the Apollo 11 I used to get in Oregon. Both wonderfully uplifting smokes.<br /><br />Best I&#039;ve had on the road so far was some J1 (Jack x Skunk) from LexiSadie. The other bud I had from her was excellent, but not on the level of the J1. I still owe her money for an extra order she accidentally sent me. I&#039;m still going to pay you back, Lexi -- promise! -- soon as I get some income rolling in.

				Summer Camp festival a few years ago I bought some pot that was grown in a small north/central Wisconsin town. The group got a half ounce of Jack Herer, Snisi Star, Random Cush, and some sort of purple stuff. But I will never forget that weed, I mean holy shit. Never had I had bud taste so good. It seems that I have a more sensitive throat than others when it comes to cannabis but I could take the hugest hits of it and it felt wonderful. I can&#039;t comment on the high very much because much edibles were ate, sleep deprivation, many drugs used, you know.

				Mostly a sativa smoker. So, Kali Mist, C99, and Choc Thai. <br /><br />For hybrids, my faves are AK47, and White Widow.<br /><br />The only indicas that I can say about are OG Kush, and DJ Shorts Blueberry (the original strain, not the True Blue)<br /><br />Now, from there I can say that Serious Seeds makes two of these (Kali, AK). So there other selections might warrant a looksee, if you like other strains from them. As for the white widow, it&#039;s supposed to be originally from Greenhouse, but that Mr. Nice has the original clones. I&#039;ve had Greenhouses, Mr. Nices, and Dinafem&#039;s. Greenhouses was actually the weakest one, and had the least heartiness of all the plants.

				no idea what it was called, but a friend of mine got some high grade shit shipped to him from canada (BC if I remember correctly) that he mixed with some hash that he also got from the same guy and holy fuck. the whole experience was just crazy. it was my first time smoking hash and boy was it memorable. I started hallucinating and shit. on my way home from his place I witnessed a traffic accident and had to help out since I was the only one who knew how to do first aid, and then I had to talk to the paramedics and cops when they eventually arrived. imagine that. here I am, high as a fucking kite, speaking to LEO that look like frikkin&#039; camels to me, fearing for my life to the point where I&#039;m almost crying because I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll notice I&#039;m high and send me to jail, but they just write my behaviour off as &quot;shaken up by accident&quot; hhahahhahaha. then I went and visited some other friends and smoked some more to calm my nerves again. damn that was one crazy night.

				i live in eastern Canada, and most of the dealers around here don&#039;t know their shit, the only times they know which strains they&#039;re selling are when it&#039;s M39 (fucking plain weed, i&#039;ve grown very tired of it since we get it most of the time.) or Freezeland (pretty decent with a fresh pine-like taste). Everything else is called &#039;&#039;exotic&#039;&#039; weed, so i&#039;ve gotten a lot of unknown bud throughout my life :(.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the best marijuana i ever smoked was some of that damn M39.<br /><br />Story goes like this: My parents ask me to go get my sister who has spent the weekend at her friend&#039;s uncle&#039;s place, so i do because i like driving. When i get there, it&#039;s a very small shack in the woods, these people don&#039;t even own a car. I meet them, they&#039;re hippies who kept living the lifestyle since the 70s, very easy-going. Anyway, to make it short, the man told me he grew his own weed for years and that he likes to crush the whole plant&nbsp; after the main leaves are taken off, then cure it and finally smoke it. So i inquire if i might buy some, and i ended up with 9g of free weed because i was too shy to ask for another handful, cause they offered. <br /><br />For some reason, this weed was the best i ever had, it was delectable, it was more tasty than the usual M39, the high was perfectly balanced.. there was just something more to it, i can&#039;t explain it into words, i guess it just has to do with the grower and not the strain.

				I bought some shit online a loooong time ago that was just fucking incredible &amp; by far the best bud I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of smoking.<br /><br />Way before SR there was a forum where you could find &quot;MOM&quot; or mail order marijuana sellers if you took the time to do your homework and network with the right ppl. Well I ended up finding this one guy from New York who sold me prob. about a gram of some of the dankest purple bud I&#039;ve EVER seen. His stealth was the absolute worst, as I remember smelling it before I even opened up my mail box. Idk how the mail man didn&#039;t catch that unless he just didn&#039;t give a fuck, so I guess I got pretty damn lucky!<br /><br />Anyway I went upstairs and my old cat, who normally could care less about weed, quickly followed me into my room and walked around me in circles just waiting for me to open up my package. So I finally open up this little bag of pure heaven, and immediately the smell filled up my entire room and I&#039;m sure the hall outside of it too. My cat would NOT quit sticking her nose in this bag and then purring about it to me! lol... I&#039;m pretty sure she was high for awhile after that just from smelling this stuff, and like I said most of the time I smoked she just didn&#039;t care at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t remember much of what happened after that, and one of the next shipments I received got confiscated by my parents, so I never had the chance to get any more of it.&nbsp; :&#039;(
