				Because as we all know, drug dealers MUST have exotic animals laying around, if animal planet has taught us anything.<br /><br />Note: Not a condoning of irresponsible animal keeping.<br /><br />For me, capybara. <br /><br />Ps. If you google capybara and see a person with a capybara that person is totally not me.<br /><br />pps. If you say &quot;buy a pitbull&quot; you fail at defining exotic and fail for wanting to buy an animal that has been filling up shelters and subsequently their dumpsters, for years.

				I had a lion for a year. He was only a kitten, about the size of a medium dog.

				Hey. Ever notice it&#039;s never the lion that attack people but always the lioness?<br />At least from what I&#039;ve seen on the surface of big cat keeping lions seem to be the safest big cat.

				Capybara would be awesome. I&#039;d get a pair so I could breed them, and sell the babies to other OGs.

				What&#039;s an OG?<br /><br />I think platypi are cool too, it&#039;s just the males are full of poison.<br />I like the aquatic animals, fun to swim with and watch swim. My capybara would come with me to the beach.@_@<br />I was thinking beforehand an otter or a mink(both swimmers). But an otter would be more difficult to feed and giant rodent trumps mink. Plus I&#039;d have to raid a fur farm for one,and also they are quite vicious until you can tame them down.

				I really like the idea of getting an albino snake of some kind, specifically if it&#039;s white as I&#039;m not fond of the yellow ones. Maybe a King snake?

				I think those are called children, but watch out. Primates in general are nasty once they hit puberty.<br />Destroying your shit, demanding food all the time, difficult to understand, all the medical care, plus all the drama that they get into.<br />Also their adoption rate is insane, 20,000 for an unwanted child.
