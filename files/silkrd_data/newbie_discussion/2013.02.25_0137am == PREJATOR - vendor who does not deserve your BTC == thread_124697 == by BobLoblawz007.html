				If it is possible to be a scammer and still send something, Prejator is this person. The supposed &quot;#4 bags&quot; of &quot;heroin&quot; being sold by Prejator are complete crap. I would have gotten higher eating 5 vicodin than shooting 5 bags from this vendor. SUPER LAME. There should be some kind of way for SR to kick out vendors with consistent bad reviews. True, SR makes a commission on any sale but they would make MORE commissions with quality vendors instead of keeping jerks like Prejator around who do nothing but turn people off, and make one quick sale per person before they realize the product is crap and do not order again.

				I think this person needs to be investigated.<br /><br />The problem is that the reviews aren&#039;t bad. Most of them are 5/5. (But I think those are fake.)<br /><br />I made the mistake of ordering from him last week, but I had no idea that the Silk Road rating system could be gamed at that time. And that is exactly what I think is happening. <br /><br />The people on the forum hate him, but he has tons of 5/5 reviews, interspersed with a few 1/5 reviews telling the same tale that is seen here in the forum. Being an SR newbie, I trusted all of the 5/5 reviews I saw without checking the forum until later when I didn&#039;t hear anything back from him. <br /><br />I ordered last week and sent him a message, and I have yet to hear a thing. I have a feeling I am out some money, which isn&#039;t a terrible thing. But it makes SR extremely disappointing for my first attempt. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what exactly is going on, but I do not think this person is honest. And I do not think SR is giving a fair assessment of this person either.

				I placed an order on Friday with priority shipping. I hadn&#039;t heard anything, so I messaged today and asked to cancel. Prejator responded quickly. He apologized, offered to add an extra bag, and said he would ship it out today if I still wanted it. <br /><br />I think I will go ahead and let him ship it. There is certainly some attempt at service, which I appreciate greatly. If the order goes out today and I receive it in 2 days or so with the priority shipping I paid for, I will update again a satisfied customer.<br /><br />If he has to cancel because he can&#039;t get it out today, I will at least be comforted in the fact that he could respond to my question relatively quickly, which is still good service to me. <br /><br />I will try to keep this updated so people can see what kind of experience to expect. My goal was to get something by Wednesday of this week. We will see if I make it!

				I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re wrong, but let me tell you about my experience with this vender.<br /><br />First, let me say that I&#039;ve never done H before this.<br /><br />I was curious about it and I also am in the process of becoming a high quality H vender so I wanted to get some more idea of what I was getting into.<br /><br />prejator was the absolute cheapest domestic vendor of H. I think I paid $20 for a single stamp bag. Since all I wanted was a sample, that was perfect for me. <br /><br />So I ordered on and it didn&#039;t go into transit for several days (just long enough for the cancel option to become active)<br /><br />His discription said that all products would go out the next day so obviously I was pissed that it had taken 5 days and it still wasn&#039;t shipped.<br /><br />I sent him a couple angry messages during those five days and got no response but I finally got an answer just as the cancel button came up. He said his computer had gotten fucked up and he was trying to answer all messages on this phone and blah blah blah. It just sounded like empty excuses right?<br /><br />But he acutally communicated back and forth with me over the next few hours - very appologetic, very communacitive, and very anxious to fix the situation.<br /><br />Because he had had a couple of bad feedbacks at the time, I basically told him to go fuck himself and canceled my order.<br /><br />What impressed me about him and what made me think that he might be telling the truth about the computer touble was that he shipped out my stamp bag anyway (for free) AND he put up a free custom listing for me to buy so that I could STILL leave feedback (keep in mind, he just opened himself up to possible bad feedback from me for no reason - because after canceling my order, I no longer had the option to leave feedback and he could have just walked away - but instead he send me the drugs for free and gave me a chance to leave whatever feedback I wanted)<br /><br />The H came in a couple days very stealthy and I snorted it and felt a nice buzz (I did the whole thing). I didn&#039;t have a scale to see how much it weighed but it was pleasent. <br /><br />I think maybe you have to understand a couple things: first, being a vendor is hard. Sometimes you can&#039;t log on to SR or it takes forever so checking messages and getting orders out is harder than if you were selling something on ebay or whatever. Second, at least when I bought, he was advertizing his H as street quality - he never said anything about what percentage of purity it was or anything. And Third, when he sells the absolute CHEAPEST H bags on SR (by half) - so I don&#039;t think you can really be too picky about quality - unless he starts making claims about what percentage of purity they are. Keep in mind that #4 does not mean that it&#039;s pure - it just means it&#039;s been processed all the way so that it&#039;s sortable and smokable.<br /><br />Agian, I&#039;m not saying he&#039;s not a scammer, I&#039;m just saying he went way out of his way to make things right with me. <br /><br />just my two cents.

				Thanks for the story funeightyone. It&#039;s good to know. <br /><br />Being new to SR, this is at least a learning experience for me. I understand that I am being a little demanding by having a goal of Wednesday, and I am trying not to hold it against Prejator that I am in a bit of a hurry. But I am almost to the point where I can cancel the order myself as well. It&#039;s too late for the mail to do any good today, so I went ahead and asked him to cancel it.<br /><br />I try to be understanding, and so long as the experience is what is expected I am happy. I think the rating system leaves a little to be desired, as it doesn&#039;t tell how long the order took to go through processing / etc. So you are left with what amounts to an advertisement to judge your expected experience with a seller. And that is no good. It could definitely be upgraded a bit. <br /><br />If I get what I am expecting, I am happy. If people under-promise and over-deliver, I am ecstatic. If people over-promise and under-deliver, well that is disappointing. But like I said, I understand that I am in a bit of a hurry. If Prejator can in some way help me reach my goal of getting what I want by Wednesday -- even if it means canceling the order -- I would be ok at least with his service. If I have to cancel it myself and can&#039;t reach my goal as a result, well, that will be disappointing.<br /><br />Trying to put myself in his shoes, it has to be a bit tough at times. But as a business person, you&#039;re supposed to make sure you&#039;re compensated for that. :)

I don&#039;t think this guy is a scammer. I just think he&#039;s probably an overly optimistic &quot;yes man&quot; who makes promises he can&#039;t keep. He might be using too much of his own product and it&#039;s keeping him from being a productive business man. In my experience on SR (about 12 transactions and a total of 3K or so), I&#039;ve found that you pretty much have to strictly deal with the 98 or better vendors if you want things to go off without a hitch. And avoid the FE vendors if you can. Because when it comes down to it, if you are a serious business person, keeping a good rating is not that hard. All you have to do is provide an accurate description of your product and communicate if things don&#039;t go according to plan. <br /><br />But all the people (vendors and customers) on SR have a huge responsibility to keep this AWESOME system working well. That means we all have to put aside the fact that we are addicts for five minutes and keep our business and our feedback honest so that the whole system can continue to improve. <br /><br />But at the end of the day, thank your fucking lucky stars that you can sit at home in the nude and order ANY FUCKING DRUG KNOWN TO MAN. It&#039;s unlike anything in the history of man and if you think about it, if we all do our parts to work together on this and keep it going and keep it improving, it really could lead to the legalization of drugs world wide. True freedom. And THAT would be something fucking beautiful. Because like anything that starts illegal and becomes legal, all it takes is for governments to realize there&#039;s not a damn thing they can do to stop it. And all that would take is for a few vendors and customers to keep acting like upstanding people (as they buy and sell their drugs lol). <br /><br />
