				There are several vendors selling counterfeit adderall. They are listed as orange 30mg. They send you light pink ones that are not legit. They might send you real ones on your first (test) order but then do the ole &quot;bait and switch&quot; and send you the fake pink ones when you throw down for a large order. PepperidgeFarm and The Cali Connect both have sent me fake ones. Both vendors described orange, legit addys and sent me carnation pink instead. They have 30 on one side and AD on the other. They look like brand name only wrong color and you can tell they have been pressed and stamped by an amateur. Some of the markings are off center. They either have no effect at all or they will make you sick (lightheaded, etc.). There is a FDA warning about fakes like this. Be careful. I will try and keep forum updated on vendors response and actions. I will also post vendors I find that are legit. Don&#039;t finalize until after you have checked out the product! How else can you give a straight review for the next guy. Just because they look legit doesn&#039;t mean they are. People that just comment on the speed and stealth, but not the quality of the product are leaving out critical information. Don&#039;t get scammed and then let it happen to the next guy without throwing out a heads up.
