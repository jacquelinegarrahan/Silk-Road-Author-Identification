				Hi guys,<br /><br />After getting some feedback from members we have added standard &quot;unsigned&quot; first class as a postage option. Unfortunately if you choose the standard first class option we cannot provide a refund in the highly unlikely event&nbsp; your package is lost. This is to protect ourselves from scams as with standard first class we have no way of knowing for sure if people are lying when they tell us a package is lost. With the special delivery option we will refund buyers in full if a package is lost....

				The problem with this is that if you don&#039;t send the product, or it gets nabbed, not only do my coins sit in escrow for eternity,&nbsp; they disappear totally at the end. This is actually worse than FE in my opinion.<br />I&#039;m writing this as someone who has yet to FE and has had a 100% receive rate from overseas except for 2 no shows from vendors who never sent the product and who gave me 100 percent refund. I also have stacks reliable drops and would never, ever sign for anything. <br />&nbsp;From my experience, most of the gear IS getting through to the so called &quot;hard to ship to &quot; countries if it&#039;s packaged correctly... Is there really THAT many scammers?&nbsp; Can&#039;t you offer us at least some kind of refund ? This would go a long way to giving us poor buyers who never scam and have epic buyer stats some confidence. <br />&nbsp;I&#039;d buy at least a ball of your charlie a week if I knew it was packed well,&nbsp; shipped on time, I didn&#039;t have to FE and you offered a 30 percent refund rate.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not the only one!&nbsp; Seriously, if you vendors want to make easy, reliable coin, all you have to do is build up a good base of buyers with great stats. The numbers don&#039;t lie when it comes to buyers.

				Thanks for listening, it&#039;s getting really hard some of us to find reliable vendors despite having excellent stats and perfect arrival rates.
