				What kind of risk is involved with using real name, address, email, phone # and whatnot with bitinstant? They have set up a new website that seems to require you put in your genuine info otherwise the transaction reads &quot;Unable to Verify Identity as Guest&quot;. <br /><br />In the Q&amp;A, a Bitinstant agent mentions &quot;When verifying your identity on BitInstant, please make sure you use your full, legal name as it appears on your government issued ID. Also, if you have moved within the last year, records may not have updated to include your most recent address. We suggest you try your previous address if your current one is not valid.&quot;<br /><br />This kind of has me a little sketched out as I am accustomed to using fake info when filling out the moneygram info, but now it seems I can only use my real info if the transaction is to process and as of now, this is my only viable means of acquiring coin&nbsp; :-\

				Well, went ahead and used my real info. Order went through and everything, deposited close to $200. I am hoping bitinstant comes through given all the complains people have been giving with their new site. No funds in my account yet, and I don&#039;t have access to the e-mail address I used to see if the transaction went through, so all I can do is play the waiting game as of now.

				Well, it seems alot of people have been receiving a message along the lines of:<br /><br />&quot;This email is to notify you that while received your payment successfully, we have encountered an error while trying to process your transaction at Jun 11 2013 12:43:56, meaning your order has currently failed.<br /><br /><br />If you contact support about this transaction, please reference this number so we can help you more quickly.<br /><br />Your payment of $190, has NOT yet been transferred to bitcoin.<br /><br />Our customer support agents have been informed of this problem and are currently investigating the problem. An agent will be in touch with you shortly regarding your account and what the next steps are. Until we understand what the issue with your transaction is, we suggest that you avoid creating further orders at BitInstant.com (in case you have entered account numbers incorrectly).<br /><br />Again, we have automatically created a support ticket about this issue and you do not need to create one manually. We will contact you shortly to help resolve your issue.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience,<br /><br />The Bitinstant Team&quot;<br /><br />Really hoping Bitinstant didn&#039;t just steal my money

				You do NOT want to use your real info.<br /><br />Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.

				It seems sketchy but remember, bitcoins are legal and anonymous. You may have to enter your info, but once you send those coins to sr they get tumbled mang. Using fake info is too much of a hassle for me. I&#039;ve used real info many times, and i&#039;m alright

				Buying BTCs is legal. MANY people use bitinstant to buy BTCs everyday for many other purposes other than SR. <br /><br />Especially if you use a tumbling service, but even if you don&#039;t, your coins are tumbled before they go into your SR address.<br /><br />Using your real info at bitinstant proves that your bought BTCs. But the coins you use on SR are not the BTCs you bought, since they have been tumbled.<br /><br />I don&#039;t quite understand why so many people are so against using real info. Using fake info seems like it would cause more hassle and suspicion.

				I read your posts and had to respond.<br />First, to the person who used the new Bitinstant and paid cash, so did I. I paid $115.00 24 hours ago and I still haven&#039;t seen my money, I was lucky enough to remember the fake email I used in mailinator and they replied back that my transaction failed, I have been going back and forth with them trying to get my bitcoin&#039;s since I received that first email, I&#039;ve been dealing with their &quot;support&quot; team for for probably 22 hours now and I still have not gotten my Bitcoin&#039;s.<br /><br />Also, I have a question regarding that other site: Bitcoin Brokers. They make you create an account too, I just tried to purchase coins. So, do you just put in bogus info?<br /><br />And lasty, if Bitinstant no longer works and if Bitcoin Brokers doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; How can we get Bitcoin&#039;s anymore???

				The reason people would want to not use their real info is in case cops come knocking at your door. Seize your laptop and connect your bitcoin bank account info with your activities in SR and match it.

				Yes the scenario I though of was if they take your laptop they&#039;ll make a connection that you have a SR account and also have a bitcoin account where you had to use your own personal bank info to set up. Thus linking your account to making purchases on SR. I might sound far fetched but it&#039;s still something you need to consider if you are trying to be anonymous.<br /><br />I guess for someone that might buy a few items a year it might not be a top priority for feds to look into but a big timer would be cautious.<br />By the way how do you go about purchasing. <br />I keep on reading many possibilities and don&#039;t really know what will work for me. <br />I would only buy a few times a year<br />Thanks<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171133.msg1229545#msg1229545">Quote from: entreterra on June 12, 2013, 10:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171133.msg1228661#msg1228661">Quote from: jedilight on June 12, 2013, 07:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">The reason people would want to not use their real info is in case cops come knocking at your door.

				From what I can tell (and I agree), the main reason you wouldn&#039;t want to give real info is you lose a good portion of deniability by doing so.&nbsp; You can&#039;t really pull off the &quot;what? what do you mean you can buy drugs over the internet?&quot; act when your lappy is full of traces of your clearnet dealings in BC.&nbsp; Granted, it technically isn&#039;t evidence that you actually ordered said drugs, but you definitely lose a large portion of what is probably going to be your best defense.<br /><br />I certainly don&#039;t want dates, sizes, or any other details of BC purchases floating around w/ any of my real info attatched.&nbsp; At least not unless (until?) it becomes a more legitimate currency.

				for those of you that just exchange small amounts of currency into bitcoin, using your real information will not be an issue.&nbsp; honestly law enforcement could give a fuck less if you buy small amounts of drugs for personal use.&nbsp; its not even worth their time to look into where your $200 is going.&nbsp; <br /><br />however for those of us that are exchanging large amounts of currency it is a much different situation.&nbsp; you cannot continuously exchange thousands of dollars into bitcoins, bitcoins into drugs, drugs into cash, and repeat repeat repeat.&nbsp; if the IRS receives records that you exchanged $60,000 into bitcoins in a year, but you are only showing $35,000 in income on tax forms for that year, then before long someone will be banging on the door looking for a lot of uncollected tax dollars.&nbsp; al capone did not go to prison for selling booze or committing violent crimes,&nbsp; he went to prison for tax evasion.

				i too had an issue with bitinstant not delivering my coins last week.&nbsp; they eventually completed the exchange, but it took about a week.&nbsp; they said there was a problem with coinapult and they had to manualy deliver, whatever that means.&nbsp; anyway just hang tight and they will get your money.<br /><br />ive also used blueskytraders several times in the past few weeks, exchanging several thousand into bitcoins.&nbsp; their service is phenomenal.&nbsp; the first time i deposited around 3pm and my coins were in my account the next morning around 7am.&nbsp; the next two times i deposited again around 3pm and each time my coins were in my account by 6pm the same day.&nbsp; you just walk into bank of america with cash and deposit into their account, no need for id or any personal info.&nbsp; my opinion may not carry much weight around here since i am fairly new and do not post often, but i highly recommend bst.
