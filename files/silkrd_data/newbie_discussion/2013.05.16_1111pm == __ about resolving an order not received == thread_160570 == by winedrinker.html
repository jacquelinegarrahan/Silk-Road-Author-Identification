				&nbsp;I&#039;ve had two successful orders with a vendor.&nbsp; The third order never arrived.&nbsp; This vendor requested finalization early (FE) and only ships by first class UPSP so there isn&#039;t a tracking number.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sent all the order info to SR support for advice on how to seek some resolution, but the vendor&#039;s profile seems to imply that sometimes this happens and the buyer should bear the entire loss.<br />I feel that at minimum both of us should take a 50% loss.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had 8 other successful orders with other vendors in the last month.&nbsp; What is a fair way to settle this issue?<br />Thanks,<br />Winedrinker

Escrow is there for your protection, and if you willfully leave escrow by Finalising Early, Silk Road cannot protect you in the event that something goes wrong.<br /><br />SR Support will be directing you to the F.A.Q. for an answer to your query, and this is where they&#039;ll be pointing you:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Escrow<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I.27ve_already_finalized_my_order.2C_but_am_having_problems.<br /><br />Never, ever FE. Everybody is responsible for their own actions here, so if you FE and you get burned, there is nobody to complain to.<br /><br />Libertas
