				I have a local bit coin trader who I go to to escape the middle man and buy direct so I don&#039;t have to pay all of the dumb fee&#039;s and get a lower price than if you&nbsp; were to on Mt. Gox. The only thing is that I&#039;m starting to wonder if I&#039;m building up suspicion purchasing large amounts of bit coins on a monthly basis? The person who is selling me these coins is ironically a fed. He asked me what my interest in coins where when I first purchased them though him and my response is that I am just interested in alternative currency. Now that the coin price has increased to $45 a coin I&#039;m obviously not reselling them anymore like one could of suspected back when they were $13.<br /><br />Should I stop local trading in favor of more anonymous online bank transfers?&nbsp;

				how do you know he is a fed? i don&#039;t think it really matters even if he is tbh... <br /><br />and I don&#039;t think theres really a difference as long as you confirm the transaction and do it on the computer with the guy there at a wi-fi spot to make sure you wont get scammed...

				Buying Bitcoins is perfectly legal, &amp; &quot;potentially suspicious activity&quot; is not sufficient grounds for an arrest, nor sufficiently important for a federal agent to sell Bitcoins to you undercover.<br /><br />What you&#039;re going has risks, but, like, what DOESNT on SR? The way you&#039;re buying Bitcoins is actually what I&#039;ve always perceived to be much safer, trustworthy, reliable, &amp; risk-free than any method of obtaining BTCs over TOR/the web is.

				He invited me into his home and we talked for a good hour and he educated me on how the whole system works. It&#039;s well known that the major use for bitcoin is illegal activities. It&#039;s just when the topic of, why are you buying bitcoins comes up I don&#039;t really have anything to tell him.
