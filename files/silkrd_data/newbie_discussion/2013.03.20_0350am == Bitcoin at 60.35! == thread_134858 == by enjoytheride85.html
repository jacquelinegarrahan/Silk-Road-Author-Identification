				Wow, I&#039;m sure glad I got in at 17 back in January, hoping to hold them for a year or so. I was going to be thrilled if they got above 25 by 2014. <br /><br />

				The spike to 62 USD today was just a blip. I want to blame institutional investors for this, since there was such a high trading volume when the price went up. BTC is the coolest new thing with hedge fund managers, you know.
