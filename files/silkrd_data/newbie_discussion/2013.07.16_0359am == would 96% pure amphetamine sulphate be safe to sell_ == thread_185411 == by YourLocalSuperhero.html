				If boymasters speed really in this pure, would it be endangering lives to sell it as is? Even with a warning to the consumer? <br /><br />The amphetamine locally is trash. A new batch comes in and is always described as &#039;fire&#039; or something similar. bit of research and most studies on purity in australia range from the 5%-15%. The stuff that gets around takes about half a gram to get a buzz and I have almost no stimulant tolerance, used 4 times in my life. although there may be some cross tolerance from occasional mdma use. <br /><br />I ordered 10g on friday and just wondering if cutting it to something like 50% would be okay. just with glucose and i&#039;ll even tell them and adjust prices accordingly. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t want anyones lives on my hands. Either cut it or sell point bags so people won&#039;t kill themselves. What do you guys think?

If people are dumb enough to ignore your warnings and ingest large quantities of a high purity drug, then that&#039;s their own fault... not yours. Natural selection and survival of the fittest at it&#039;s finest, at least in my opinion.

				Ever heard of, &quot;Smoke less, more high&quot;? Refers to quality weed/hash.<br /><br />It should be safer if it is pure. You don&#039;t mix drugs (with cutting agents) which damages your body extremely.<br />Also, it is different to pure cocaine, because overdose of amphetamine is rarely fatal. Or even lethal. If anything, pure should be safer and also helped users determine consistent and exact doses (if they got the scales)

				&nbsp; I agree with above poster, you&#039;re doing people a favour giving them close to pharmaceutical grade gear, if that&#039;s what it actually is. You should definitely warn them, and advise them to take a small control dose to test their reaction to it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The thing about amphets, that are generally majority cut minority gear, is people get used to the dirty high. A clean amphet high will probably have some people complaining about the quality, telling you you&#039;re full of shit that the gear&#039;s high purity.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Aussiepp, come on mate, that&#039;s brutal! This guy doesn&#039;t want to sell a couple of points, make $100, and have someone die in the process. If not for reasons of humanity and common decency, then consider the cops, who do not appreciate dealers selling lethal gear one bit.

				That&#039;s the danger with purity. The price is either REALLY high for such high purity, it&#039;s NOT pure at all, or it&#039;s some other drug.<br /><br />This is dangerous because someone could be shooting it, and they could do the shot of death. Happens with pure H all the time, people not expecting a prodcut that isn&#039;t cut to shit and then... welp.
