				I cant help but have doubts that its over. Even if DPR and the team get this back up and running in a week what if its down again the next day for another indefinite amount of time. Vendors are losing sales, customers are going elsewhere and the reputation of SR will suffer badly if it has not yet. How much confidence will be lost after this attack alone? I have posted sales in escrow that cant be finalised. I have orders I cant access to see if they are posted or not. There are funds in my accounts I cant even access. Then when &#039;SR is up and running people are going to be afraid. Sales will be lost and no knows if or when SR will be shut down again without notice and how many will not want to take the risk. Im an SR Loyalist. Its done a great service being a customer and doing some small scale sales. But right now I stand to lose more money than I can just forgive myself for. Im a struggler and times are tough. Losing a couple hundred is a big deal to me. I know Im not alone too and others are sharing the same pain. Ive worked hard for years and invested into what I thought was a safe market. Id been a buyer for many months and I was amazed how well it all worked I decided to take the plunge and become a small time vendor just to make paying bills easier and to hopefully get ahead for a change. Ive worked hard labour for years. Ive averaged 60+ hrs a week since 2007. But Im not rich. I have rent, a car, bills, fuel you all know. I invested some savings into setting up a vendor account as I had confidence in Silk road. It had never failed me in about a year as a buyer. Now 5 weeks after spending $1000&#039;s to sell Im out of business. I cant even get the sellers bond return which was due this week. I was finally building a customer base and&nbsp; a reputation. It was just gettting to the point where investment was going to become income. Then these unfortunate events occurred. <br />Silk road is down as we all know. <br />In the same week my Dr has diagnosed me sick and informed the transport authority&#039;s to suspend mu licence because Im unwell to drive. My occupation is as a driver so Ive effectively lost my fulltime income. <br />This is all too much for me. If SR does never recover I am screwed. I can get on welfare being sick but it wouldnt even pay my weekly rent. I cant work as Im medically not even allowed to. I have one pay cheque left and I have 2 weeks paid and after that Im homeless. I cant even live in my car as I have no licence to drive it. <br />Ive been pumping myself with Valiums and Etizolam for the past 2 days. Im depressed beyond belief. Its all hopeless. <br />I need SR more than anyone. Ive worked too long and hard to be in this position in life.&nbsp; I got no family or anyone close to rely on. Ive always survived on my own. <br />SR could be up tomorrow for what I know but I always have to consider the worst possible scenario. <br />If I could help SR or DPR Id be there 100%. I just dont know that they can even survive this or if it will be followed by another till all hope is lost.&nbsp; All I know is that my life is falling apart. <br />Sorry for the pessimism. I really hope DPR fixes this soon and SR get back to the safe reliable and legendary site it was only a few days ago.&nbsp; <br />Skitta78.

				Personally, I have every faith in the DPR and his team.<br />SR will be back.<br /><br />I had a couple of items due to be sent, right before the first wave of attacks. I&#039;ve managed to contact vendors and it seems that 50% of my items have gone out, the other 50% are stuck in the system. Meh. I can wait. I only buy personal usage amounts, and because of this I only buy bitcoins as and when I need them. So, no coins are sitting in my SR wallet. <br /><br />I&#039;m loyal to SR, and all the while the closure remains temporary I shall remain loyal. <br /><br />I say again though, I have every faith that SR will be back - and stronger than ever.

				I have faith in DPR and his team. And if they asked me, which is unlikely, I&#039;d do anything I could to help out. <br /><br />I&#039;m more worried about paying for my orders. I received one yesterday, but I can&#039;t get on to finalize. <br /><br />I know the vendor will understand, but I feel bad about it.<br /><br />I have a couple other outstanding orders&nbsp; that I&#039;m *slightly* concerned about. I have one that should have been here by now from a vendor who I&#039;ve never used before that will finalize in 10 days.<br /><br />I have another that will finalize in 2 weeks from a brand new vendor who I decided to give&nbsp; a shot that will finalize in two weeks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t stand to lose a lot of money, but I&#039;m screwed if it doesn&#039;t come back up.<br /><br />Actually they&#039;re screwed too since they have no way to get the money out anyway.<br /><br />I feel most bad for my regular, reliable vendor whose products I&#039;ve received and would like to pay for. This guy got my order to me in less than 72 hours of placing it -- and I ordered Friday night. That deserves to be rewarded with prompt finalization.<br /><br />To him, I&#039;m terribly sorry, even though it&#039;s not my fault -- it&#039;s more unfortunate.<br /><br />But I think everything will be back up within the next few days. The problem is pretty complicated based on what I&#039;ve read from DPR&#039;s last post. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a quick fix unfortunately.

				I have faith it will be back.<br /><br />I appreciate I_Hate_Scammers who is concerned about finalizing his orders. I shipped out all orders I received before the site went down. But I have no way of communicating with the receivers or collecting the escrowed cash. That said its a business risk and we will wait it out.<br /><br />Hope everyone is well. <br /><br />@@CaliGirl@@

				Fingered crossed x<br /><br />Hopefully these ongoing issues will resolve soon enough. Waiting 2 weeks now based on poor vendor postage times and SR downtime...Kinda wish I had gone elsewhere recently :S<br /><br />Have some faith though that all will be fixed soon :)

				Definitely there should be an invite automatically to those SR buyers and sellers already there, but this may not stop a DDoS attack. You can have a pretty lame website with little or no traffic that can still be targeted to take it out of action. This is why DPR is talking about a possible need to consult Tor developers. They are unlikely to want to get directly involved, and more likely a split-up or a conglomerate of individual sites may be a workable solution.

				I would be really surprised if this is the end. I have seen it go down several times and it has always come back in the past. Last year it went down for what, about 2 weeks?

				I&#039;m sure that SR will remain but it might become limited to the current members temporarily. The bigger issue is really the confidence that will be lost with the Buyers and Sellers in the system. I honestly hope it will be back soon as I also have to make income to help with my parents&#039; bills. We all share your pain and hope you will make it through ok.
