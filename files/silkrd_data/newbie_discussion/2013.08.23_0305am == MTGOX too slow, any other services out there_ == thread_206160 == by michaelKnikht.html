				localbitcoins.com! All you need, way faster and more anonymous than an exchange. Most sellers take a fraction of the time, in fact. No verification or other bullshit.

				I used to use mt.gox all the time, but what used to take 3-4days to get bitcoins, now takes 4-8days... <br />i was then told about www.btcquick.com on here a few weeks back, and its great when you need btc in a hurry. <br /><br />You get btc within hours and you use google wallet to pay (so its safe). Only downer is that it&#039;s about 10% more expensive than mt.gox, and the first time you buy you have to send in a verification document (scanned image of ID). <br /><br />First order of 1btc inc registration and verification took me 24hours. So very quick indeed. <br /><br />Forgot to mention they charge a $2 registration/membership fee also... which is not too nice.. but oh well... i like having btc within hours&nbsp; :)

				I didn&#039;t like MTGOX because of the whole wire transfer to a Japanese bank thing. Coinbase is much simpler, but it does take 4-5 days to get the coins. Now that the initial wait is over and my SR account is funded, I&#039;ll prob still use Coinbase again before I need the BCs.

				I get fairly good exchange times using VirWox and can use paypal to make purchases too. The downside is that it is a Linden $ exchange first not a BC exchange. Consequently you must buy BC first and then convert those into BC. Consequently you are paying a fee at both steps as well but generally the exchange rate is favorable enough (especially if one uses limit bidding) that the fees paid have been more than offset by the speed of the service.

				I use campbx now. They seem a little quicker than mt gox but not too much. I also don&#039;t deal with a lot of flow. Pretty quick when you have cash on hand buy coin, and transmit.&nbsp; A couple hours usually will have the bits where you want them. I have never had anything I really wanted be sold out like this. Plus both seemn to be reliable orgs, and so having cash in an account isn&#039;t to risky. Many a time with mt gox they tracked down missing coinage and returned to me.&nbsp;

				everybody says bitcoin is anonymous but its not. It can b traced back to where it came from and your xchange has all your info.&nbsp; Does SR randomize the coins in your account so you can&#039;t b traced???? I heard that they do but am not sure.

				Local bitcoin doesn&#039;t need any more verification than an email address.<br />You don&#039;t have t source local either.. Look n any area and find a seller that accepts deposits at a bank with a branch near you...
