				Fellow human beings, I just had my first experience with LSD tonight thanks to SR and I would like to lay out to you what may have been the most interesting and out there experience of my life. Apologies if this may seem stream of consciousness, but alas..<br /><br />I have never done LSD, and had no idea what to expect. I took a ~100 micro gram dose with my room mate and waited for the experience to arrive.<br /><br />At my peak I felt like what could only be described as being on the very bleeding edge of reality, so close from coming out of my body entirely and transcending to whatever it is beyond this current experience we are all having. I held myself back, but it felt like there was something absolutely there, some great beyond, as if I could shed my skin and just exist as a light being if this makes sense. Well, as I was initially coming up I was feeling very excited and jittery and just in all around high spirits, almost akin to having taken a 20 milligram dosage of instant release adderall. <br /><br />I have this girl in my life who I dated a number of years ago, who happens to be home for the summer, and we have been hanging out. The truth is I enjoy being around her but only within the confines of my home environment, where we hang out, watch some TV shows, eat food, and have sex. But I have no illusion that I am not prepared to commit to this girl in any way tangible. I am just not at a point in my life where I want to deal with having the modern girlfriend. Been there, done that. When she leaves to go back to her life after summer ends, I will continue with my life.<br /><br />Anyways, some of her friends from her school were also down visiting here, and I was initially very excited with the idea of her coming over and her friends as well. I didn&#039;t know her friends at all, and I have no idea what she told them her relationship with me was. They had been drinking and come to our apartment door and it&#039;s my girl, her two friends, and a guy friend of theirs. They walk in and we do the standard handshake and whatnot but it dawns on me that handshaking is kind of weird and that I love all my fellow human beings and it just seemed so natural to hug the girls as we were introduced. One was receptive, the other (sober DD) said something along the lines of &quot;I don&#039;t do hugs&quot; in a pretty rude way and I was immediately taken aback. Anyways, these people are younger than myself and we have absolutely nothing in common. I was still nowhere near my peak but the whole environment immediately changed, the realization dawning that I was about to be confronted with a bunch of social hoops to jump through that I could not care less about! <br /><br />They do not know my roommate and myself are tripping on LSD, and so we congregate in the kitchen. I could tell that her girlfriends were trying to sniff out what the deal is here, who is this guy etc etc etc and what does he really think about her. Somehow the conversation drifted towards my girls&#039; parents house (as all her friends were going to be staying there later in the night) and I must have let on that I don&#039;t go by her parents house (anymore), the reality being... I am just hanging out and fucking this girl, and I have 0 interest in dealing with her mother or father. My girl was trying to show physical affection towards me in front of the group and I just couldn&#039;t handle it. I tried to appease her but the whole thing just reminded me of being in high school again and how awkward and unnecessary (immature) public display of affection is, particularly in this circumstance! <br /><br />Her friend says to me &quot;So... are you going to come to our formal?&quot; and I am like drawing a blank... I hated all of that greek life shit when I was in college and the idea of flying out to some random ass college and reliving the non-existent glory days was just the furthest possible point from where I was feeling at that moment in time. I can&#039;t imagine what my face must&#039;ve looked like, but I basically didn&#039;t respond, and she kind of pressed it, and let&#039;s be real... that girl could not for a moment imagine what it was like experiencing this process from my point of view. Anyways, while my roommate and I are usually keen on socializing with new people and getting to know them, it was nearly impossible to make conversation with these people. Have you ever been in an awkward situation with younger people today? Everyone flips out a phone. Actually, phones were already out, snapchatting away pictures that I literally cringe at the idea of.<br /><br />Speaking with my roommate later, the way to describe this is like... the tension, the total disconnect between myself, him, and these other strangers who came into our environment, was so tangible, and just SO thick. I sat my girl down (because obviously she was casting me nervous and anxious and just weird looks) and try to deal with that situation, which ends up me taking her into my room closing the door and telling her I am tripping on acid and that the whole experience &quot;out there&quot; with her friends was just simply way too much. I am not sure how this happened, but conversation quickly devolved into the &quot;TALK&quot;, the talk me and her were going to have to happen, some point in the future, when she left to go back to school, that one where I am like &quot;this was a summer fling&quot;. She was very upset (understandably) and I kept drawing a blank on the whole experience, I wanted to comfort her but also was just content to be EXISTING and the whole power of the trip was really making it difficult to sound convincing. <br /><br />She kept asking me to know the truth, as in, who am I really, am I seeing other girls, etc. Well I was drawing a blank because the truth is obviously not what she wanted to hear, and I just couldn&#039;t bring myself to tell her that the reason I called her when she was back in town was yes, I did want to see her, but I also remember she had an absolutely gorgeous and tasty pussy, and a tight little gymnast body/ass to go with it. It went from like &quot;maybe we should never see each other ever again&quot; to we were cuddling and holding each other, which honestly felt amazing. I am not sure how the transition occurred but we put our heads together and they literally fit like lock and key and we held each other for a moment and I literally experienced this other being like I have never felt anything before in my life. <br /><br />&lt;TL/DR&gt;: I tripped acid for the first time, had my ex-gf-current-summer-fling come over with her friends who I didn&#039;t know, whom proceeded to be girls and try to figure out the question of &quot;is this guy serious or not about our friend or is he just fucking her&quot;. The truth serum in the acid totally inhibited me from playing the part of nice guy I normally would play (not to say I wasn&#039;t nice!), and I projected my subconscious direct to the foray. This led to the most awkward and tangibly thick social encounter I have ever experienced in my life. I experienced my girl experiencing the plight of the modern female, which is to say, that men will go pretty far, and maintain a pretty veneer just to get that pussy.<br /><br />I am sure if I had been on LSD with just this girl it would have been an incredible experience. I have learned my lesson and have much respect for this chemical. The feeling of being a conscious being is unbelievable.<br />

				Welcome to the land of the enlightened!<br /><br />I have done trips many times, the first time over 20 years ago, and many have been astounding. <br /><br />A word of caution though: Make sure you try to ensure a SAFE environment when you trip, and also try to avoid having anything taxing to do for a couple of days after the experience. LSD can be very draining, and it can be difficult to connect to the real world for a while after you come down.<br /><br />What do I mean by SAFE? With friends who are also tripping, preferably at home, watching TV....However its very common to go for a walk to a park or forest in the early hours of the morning, do some old fashioned tree hugging and watch the dawn come up. This is HIGHLY recommended - it will blow your mind.<br /><br />Unusual, threatening or sociable situations are best avoided. LSD is not what I would call a party drug - its contemplative and spiritual, and best enjoyed quietly with those closest to you.<br /><br />After what you describe, I&#039;m VERY surprised you didnt have a bad trip to be honest. Your description has all the hallmarks of everything to avoid when tripping - socialising with strangers, breaking up with you GF etc..<br /><br />Consider yourself VERY lucky that things turned out OK!<br /><br />However be aware that if you DO have a bad time, there is a quick and painful solution. Make sure that you have some high strength Vitamin C tablets on you before you trip. If you meet old Mr Fear - and you WILL meet him at some point - eat a few of those tabs and you will come down rapidly and painfully. Your head will feel like a pig shat in it, but you will be DOWN.<br /><br />Good luck, and as always - HAPPY LANDINGS!<br /><br />tw0fac3<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				What a lovely, wonderful story! Thanks for sharing!<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken LSD only recently, twice on the same festival-like event (but having had experiences with other psychedelics before), both times 130ug - i got the impression that i get more empathic, can assess the vibes between people or animals btw, - my communication with someone&#039;s dog felt -awesome, and that&#039;s me normally being afraid of dogs (!) .. I think i got over my fear of dogs now... it had also the effect, especially during the 3-days-long afterglow, that I was more selective on food and drinks, and generally recognized better what is good for me and what isn&#039;t. That&#039;s what it has in common with shrooms. My ability to cope with &quot;bad vibes&quot; was actually better than usual, and I felt everything was just loveable and funny. Of course I had to step out into a safe place for a while, when the experience was near peak. Interestingly, it all blended in very well with the therapy sessions I was having before and after.<br /><br />@tw0fac3&nbsp; . i have not a bad trip neither on shrooms nor on acid yet. Only once on 2C-B but that was probably because I tried to get something out of it what it&#039;s not made for - and once on MDMA but I was able to clean out some psycho-dirt during the come up and still enjoyed the second half of the session. Perhaps on introverts like myself, the phenylethylamine family is a bit harder than on more balanced persons or extroverts.

				It is bad when we lie to others but worse when we lie to ourselves. The best thing about LSD is that your true thoughts and feelings will be exposed and it can help you live a more honest and genuine life.

				iirc, truth serum capabilities were one of the aspects the CIA was exploring when that scientist flew out the 7th floor of a NY hotel room in the 1950s (i think 1957 or 59) - that little pc of factoid kind of tells you how long in the tooth i am

				haha oh man, yeah some parts of that would have defiantly cycled me into a bad trip, or at least a loop of bad thoughts I would have to bite my tongue from saying. How did your room mate make out when you left him in the other room momentarily with all those people he didn&#039;t know? haha
