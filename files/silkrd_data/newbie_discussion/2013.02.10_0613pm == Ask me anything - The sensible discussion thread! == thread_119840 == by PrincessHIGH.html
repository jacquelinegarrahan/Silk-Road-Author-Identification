				The sheer amount of spam on the newbie board saddens me, yes I understand you want to reach the magical 50 posts so you&#039;re free to post on all the other boards, I especially empathise with you if you&#039;re a vendor who&#039;s just starting out, if you&#039;re wishing to post a review, or if your someone who contributes every now and again, for anyone who is in one of the aforementioned situations I really feel for you. As an established forum member and long term consumer of SilkRoad I&#039;ve made this thread for sensible discussion, feel free to ask me anything sensible and I&#039;ll try my best to help you. Happy travels everyone :)

				Hello Princess! And thank you for doing this (the spam was honestly discouraging me a bit as well.&nbsp; Not saying I didn&#039;t do it, but at I least tried to make it funny). <br /><br />Anyway, my question is about the fastest and most anonymous way to obtain BTC. From everything I&#039;ve read and researched, the fastest and most anonymous way is bitinstant cash to email option (and could have it sent to a tormail address for added anonymity of course).&nbsp; However, I&#039;m not sure how long this would take.&nbsp; Have you ever used this method? Also bitinstant claims you can pay at CVS among other places, and when I called them, they had no idea what I was talking about.&nbsp; Though they may not know what the receipt is that you&#039;re bringing in. However, I would imagine they would at least be aware of it, even if they don&#039;t know much about it. That made me apprehensive about doing the cash to email option. But I really don&#039;t want the bitcoin tied to me in any way honestly. Funding from a bank, paypal or dwolla account seems too risky to me (though I could be wrong).&nbsp; Also if you have used this method (cash to email option), how long does it generally take? I&#039;ve heard both good and bad things about bitinstant, so its tough to get a clear read of the situation honestly. <br /><br />Anyway, thanks again for your help in the newbie area!

From my experience persistence always pays off! A tip to make life slightly easier: If you find a vendor you like and wish to return to their page always remember to click the &#039;become a fan&#039; link on their vendors page, this will bookmark the vendor to the front page of your account. I wish you all the best with your search, happy hunting :)

I wouldn&#039;t change a thing, I wish the SilkRoad customer base grows and expands with more great people, there&#039;s never enough great people in the world :) <br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg814311#msg814311">Quote from: 357beerdrinker on February 11, 2013, 07:50 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you could change 1 thing about the vendor base on SR, what would it be? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> More variety and more vendors joining from far flung parts of the world who have something &#039;different&#039; to offer, one can never have enough choice in a global market ;)

				Thank you very much for your warm welcome!<br /><br />Now I have not made my first purchase yet, but am close.<br /><br />Here are a couple fast questions, if you don&#039;t mind, and back ground to go with the questions:<br /><br />I bought 10 btc over at a place called Coinbase.&nbsp; They have told me I must wait 6 more days until the funds clear.&nbsp; Okkkkkk.&nbsp; So, there is a wallet there with my 10 btc available at the end of this coming week.&nbsp; After reading about I am starting to think that something is wrong.&nbsp; Did I buy at the wrong place to have to wait a week while I read others only wait hours?&nbsp; Further, once these btc are done &quot;pending&quot; I can buy more from Coinbase.&nbsp; (But, maybe I need to buy elsewhere?)<br /><br />However, I also got a Blockchain wallet, thinking I had to put my Coinbase btc there, prior to it going to SR.&nbsp; Now I realize I have two wallets.&nbsp; One empty and one waiting to have the funds cleared.&nbsp; First question is: did I buy from a place that is more traceable then going through any other seller of btc?&nbsp; Who do you recommend in the US?&nbsp; <br /><br />Second question:&nbsp; no matter where the wallet is that I have the btc, how do I put btc into the SR?&nbsp; I cannot figure this part out.&nbsp; Can you please advise?<br /><br />

The main reason why Bitcoins have almost doubled in price is because the mined blocks have halved from 50 to 25 on november 25th 2012, meaning the miners have to work twice as hard for the same amount of Bitcoins, I believe they were selling their surplus stock from the mined 50 blocks up until six weeks ago, when the 50 block supply was exhausted in came the 25 blocks, also remember the majority of us here don&#039;t purchase our coins directly from the miners, it&#039;s a tiered system, the miners supply the traders, and the traders supply the consumers, everyone takes a cut which adds to the rapid rise of Bitcoin. There&#039;s a vendor called DrugsAndCash http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119929.msg813883#msg813883 who is selling at €15.50, I can&#039;t personally recommend him as I have never used his service, you&#039;ll need to talk to him and decide for yourself, I&#039;ve sent the link you&#039;re way as he might be able to save you some €&#039;s. The majority of vendors peg their listings to the U.S dollar meaning it hasn&#039;t become anymore expensive to purchase than it was before, meaning when the exchange for US $ inflates the price of Bitcoin deflates. If you ever need a quick and accurate way to find out how much your listing is in € I&#039;d recommend (clearwebalert) coinmill.com/BTC_EUR.html I hope you find my answer helpful :)

Firstly, do your research and work out how much you wish to spend, remember generally if it&#039;s &#039;more&#039; it&#039;s &#039;generally&#039; a higher quality product, there are exceptions to this rule but the price you pay for a &#039;bargain&#039; is a lengthy shipping time, for example the best coke I&#039;ve received from SilkRoad comes from mexico, the drawback it&#039;s a three week wait, however for the price and quality it&#039;s well worth it in my opinion, I know it&#039;s coming and it gives me something to look forward to lol! Speaking from experience if you plan well ahead there&#039;s considerable savings to be made. When you&#039;ve found a vendor you like the look of before you go ahead check to see if they have a review thread in the &#039;Rumor mill&#039; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=7.0 just search their name there, many people have lost money on the marketplace as they haven&#039;t checked the vendors feedback on the forum. If you have any further questions feel free to ask me, I don&#039;t see you as a cockroach I see you as a butterfly or any other attractive insect you wish to be, I mean this in the kindest and most flattering way, if there&#039;s any other questions you need answered to help spread your wings I&#039;m here for you :)

				First of all, I must thank you for making a thread where new people, as well as oldtimers, can ask pretty much anything. It&#039;s very hard to a newbie to adapt to all rules applied, and how to come off as a serious buyer. I&#039;m currently waiting on the seller to accept the deal, which is making me pretty anxious that I&#039;ve done something wrong in the process, even though - according to my observations - done everything by the textbook. I even agreed on FE, since the seller in mind has a very good reputation. The question I&#039;m asking myself if it&#039;s common practice amongst well established sellers to just ignore newcomers as myself, without even leaving a reason why they&#039;ve chosen not to proceed with the deal. Maybe it was just an unlucky coincidence, but it&#039;s very hard to build up a reputation as a well mannered guy if you&#039;re not even given the chance to prove yourself. My english is not top notch,&nbsp; but I hope I made myself somewhat clear :)<br /><br />Sorry for my rant, and thanks a lot for your time. <br /><br /><br />Best regards.

It&#039;s a little odd but if the vendor wishes to spend $5000 on account fees rather than $500 it&#039;s their personal choice. If you need an official answer on this I suggest you contact &#039;SR Support&#039; through the marketplace silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/104259

There&#039;s nothing wrong with your english to me, I&#039;m from the UK I&#039;ve read your post perfectly. If it&#039;s any consolation I haven&#039;t heard back from a vendor who I&#039;ve made a repeat order with, brilliant product unfortunately I&#039;m unhappy with his lack of communication, there&#039;s no information on his vendors page announcing his leave, I wouldn&#039;t mind if I was informed, I empathise with you I don&#039;t like being left in the dark neither, on the other hand something could have happened, I&#039;ll never know but I hope he gets in touch sometime today. If you didn&#039;t FE (stayed in escrow) and your order is not accepted within 72 hours (I think that&#039;s the right amount of time) you can cancel it with no effect on your purchasing stats. However as you&#039;ve finalised early (FE&#039;d), SilkRoad cannot help you if your order is unsuccessful, it&#039;s the gamble you took when you chose to conduct an order outside their escrow system. Always keep in mind even the most legit vendor can turn rouge anytime, this happened long before my time feel free to read about the infamous &#039;tony76&#039; and the &#039;420 scam&#039; (clearwebalert) http://allthingsvice.com/tag/tony76/ I don&#039;t wish to cause fear but I just want to share the honest facts with you, I sincerely wish you have a happy ending. Personally, I&#039;ve never FE&#039;d, from my first order until now I&#039;ve always stayed in escrow, there&#039;s vendors out there who trust newbies to stay in escrow, you&#039;ve got to hunt for them, do searches on the &#039;Rumor mill&#039; thread, and always politely ask the vendor directly if they&#039;ll accept it. I wish you all the best :)

				Dear PrincessHIGH<br /><br />So, im planning to make a very small purchase (0.5 bit-coin), and I want to use the &quot;pay with phone* method on blockchain.info.

But have no fear here&#039;s where you can win the game, use blockchain.info&#039;s mixer service (clearwebalert) https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-anonymously to remove all taint (tracking info) of your Bitcoins, all for a very reasonable 1.5% fee, use your SR wallet as your send to address and you&#039;re good to go :)

I&#039;ve had the joy of experiencing some truly outstanding coke from SilkRoad far superior to the supposed &#039;rocket fuel&#039; I can pick up IRL for ripoff prices that&#039;s basically lidocaine and a bunch of false promises, I&#039;m a chatter box and cocaine suits me down to a tea, I also love my molly too, however I went rather nuts on it last night, I did 1000mg without alcohol just water and pineapple juice, I know I&#039;m bonkers but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, I&#039;m one of those people who loves my friends but can equally enjoy my own company, my roll inspired me to create this thread, when I&#039;m on MDMA it fills me up with so much love I feel like I&#039;m about to burst with sweet emotion! I&#039;ve also had some awesomely dank weed especially from canada, I&#039;ve never seen buds so beautiful.

If you &#039;do the deal&#039; outside of SilkRoad&#039;s escrow system there is nothing they can do to help you (as the money is out of their hands and in the vendors). You can take action by going to the vendor&#039;s homepage and clicking the &#039;report this vendor&#039; link and making a report, you may need to give it some time but &#039;SR Support&#039; will investigate your claim. You can also warn others by starting a thread here, but in terms of &#039;being refunded&#039; unless the vendor refunds you, I&#039;m sorry to say you&#039;re out of pocket.

				Thanks for the answer fatoldsun and PrincessHIGH&nbsp; :)<br /><br />blojan - If you FE you can still edit your feedback and rating for the transaction. You go to Account &gt; View Feedback, and from there you&#039;ll see the feedback you&#039;ve left for orders and they have an edit button next to them.<br /><br />I have no idea about the second aspect of your question, but I had wondered myself whether vendors ever fake feedback (actually I had wondered why new vendors don&#039;t seem to be doing it from what I&#039;ve seen, since it looks like it would be very easy to do)

If the vendor&#039;s feedback looks suspicious, always investigate it, check which listing/s the feedback pertains to, and use common sense if the vendor has accumulated all the feedback from selling &#039;0.01 BTC e-guides&#039; and is now listing oz&#039;s of coke at a price &#039;too good to be true&#039; you&#039;ll know something is up. Always check the forums too for the vendor&#039;s review thread, the forum will always be the first place where a scam surfaces often long before the vendor does a runner with your Bitcoins.

Firstly, I recommend you invest in some 0.01 scales, there&#039;s a wide variety on the clarnet as cheap as chips, there is nothing illegal about purchasing scales, just get some to roll in control. I also advise you take less rather than more as you can always up your dose but never down your dose. Keep in mind MDMA is an upper, it sends your metabolism into hyperdrive. Drinking fluids is the right thing to do, however alcohol will dehydrate you. From personal experience (and I&#039;m in the minority here), I don&#039;t enjoy drinking with my MDMA, I find it lessens the effects and quality of my roll. If you are going to drink, my best advice is to have a drink or two while your coming up, you don&#039;t need to drink too much to have a great roll, a little alchol is fine but don&#039;t over do it. If you want to make the most out of your roll get some 5-HTP from your local health food/supplements shop, I find taking it the day before (200mg) intensifies my roll and overall experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend you read this amazing thread it contains a plethora of good advice, &#039;MDMA is neurotoxic. Here are some guidelines you should follow when rolling&#039; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048.0 it&#039;s a fantastic pre-roll read.

The main instigator for the rapid inflation is the &#039;bitcoin blocks&#039; the &#039;bitcoin miners&#039; mine halved last November from fifty bitcoins to twenty five bitcoins, which means that the miners have to work twice the for the same amount of bitcoins and spend double the electricity to mine them. Why it&#039;s taken so long to filter down the system is because I believe the miners saved huge stockpiles of the &#039;twenty five block&#039; bitcoins which stabilised the currency, as soon as this supply was exhausted, the miners started selling the &#039;fifty bitcoin&#039; blocks, twice the work, twice the electric, resulting in the bitcoins doubling very rapidly,&nbsp; and just taking a quick peak on the Mt Gox chart, bitcoin is just a few bitcents away from tripling in value since december. More people are starting to know about bitcoin, none of my IRL friends knew about bitcoin when I started using this currency, now about 60% do, I wasn&#039;t the one who told them, more tv and newspaper reports, more exposure, more people want Bitcoins, more demand less supply. Another much lesser contributing factor is due to the many financial crisis in the world, some people are loosing faith in their currencies and are perhaps investing in bitcoins. There&#039;s too much buzz and excitement going around the bitcoin market to decrease, but never say never there may be a crash it&#039;s happened before, bitcoin is a volatile currency, if feel concerned only buy what you&#039;re going to spend and spend&nbsp; the same day you acquired, that way you&#039;ll be safe :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg859114#msg859114">Quote from: Atnas Daor Klis on February 25, 2013, 07:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I remember you made a thread where newbie vendors and reviewers could post their review or product offer on the regular sections of forum.

				Hey guys, I&#039;ve got a question about psychedelics. I&#039;ve been desperate to try shrooms and acid for a while now, and since discovering SR I&#039;ve obviously been able to realise these dreams! I was wondering which you would recommend I try first? I&#039;ve read up on dosages, set &amp; setting or whatever variation on that theme you fancy, and all the rest of the finer details, so I feel I&#039;m fairly in the know (in theory at least) on those parts. But which would you say is the least dramatic or, in other words, best for a first timer?<br /><br />One love :)

				I would say either could be good, but the dose is the most important bit. You could have under- or over-whelming trips on either. I haven&#039;t tried acid, so I&#039;ll speak to mushrooms: I tried shrooms for the first time the other day, with a dose of just under 2.4g (dried cubensis). For me, that was a good trip - very good to give you a &#039;taste&#039; of shrooms, I think. But if I were to do it again, I think I could have handled a higher dose (~2.8g to be on the safe side) and had a much better experience. <br /><br />That said, I have some previous drug experience that perhaps means I would be better equipped to handle higher doses - quite a lot of weed, MDMA a handful of times, 2c-b once and a high (1200ug) dose of 25i. In particular, the 25i was a very &#039;easy&#039; trip, but it certainly gave me a strong indication of the visuals and the general &#039;tripping&#039; mindset.

If you wish to be safeguard yourself concerning the &#039;illegality&#039; of SilkRoad you need to wash your coins through a tumbler removing their taint, information that could possibility be traced back to you, there&#039;s options available on the clearweb and darkweb with variable rates, check it&#039;s legit service and go with whichever one is best for you. There&#039;s a lot of talk on the Bitcoin forums&nbsp; about mining equipment, it cuts out all the hard work for the miner, mining can be very profitable, especially now, if there wasn&#039;t anything to be made the miners wouldn&#039;t be mining, the key to it is mining in volume, requiring a ton of hardware and using one heck of a lot of electric. Money makes money as they say, if you&#039;re interested in the subject of mining hardware I recommend you take a look here (clearwebalert) www.butterflylabs.com (a very popular brand of miner).

I&#039;ve been desperate to try shrooms and acid for a while now, and since discovering SR I&#039;ve obviously been able to realise these dreams! I was wondering which you would recommend I try first? I&#039;ve read up on dosages, set &amp; setting or whatever variation on that theme you fancy, and all the rest of the finer details, so I feel I&#039;m fairly in the know (in theory at least) on those parts. But which would you say is the least dramatic or, in other words, best for a first timer?<br /><br />One love :) </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg861350#msg861350">Quote from: lemonz0r on February 26, 2013, 08:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would say either could be good, but the dose is the most important bit. You could have under- or over-whelming trips on either. I haven&#039;t tried acid, so I&#039;ll speak to mushrooms: I tried shrooms for the first time the other day, with a dose of just under 2.4g (dried cubensis). For me, that was a good trip - very good to give you a &#039;taste&#039; of shrooms, I think. But if I were to do it again, I think I could have handled a higher dose (~2.8g to be on the safe side) and had a much better experience. <br /><br />That said, I have some previous drug experience that perhaps means I would be better equipped to handle higher doses - quite a lot of weed, MDMA a handful of times, 2c-b once and a high (1200ug) dose of 25i. In particular, the 25i was a very &#039;easy&#039; trip, but it certainly gave me a strong indication of the visuals and the general &#039;tripping&#039; mindset. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thank-you lemonz0r for answering, I haven&#039;t got a clue about psychedelics, I tried 2C-B once and had a terrible trip mainly down to my sitter.

				Hey Princess, I appreciate what you&#039;re doing; maybe you could update the first thread with a faq of sorts?<br /><br />There are 2 other people who&#039;ve started something like this and both have covered extensive topics(many have been rehashed in this thread). The other 2 threads have since become buried but I can dig them out for you if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; If you were to simply make an faq updated in the first thread it would be a great help for the newbs and it would ACTUALLY keep the spam down.&nbsp;

Check the vendor&#039;s rating, feedback, an if the vendor has successful arrivals in your country, do your research and you&#039;ll be fine :) <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg865406#msg865406">Quote from: ScoobyDoo on February 27, 2013, 06:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Edit:<br />Sorry, I&#039;m apparently too stoned to realize this question was not for me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No need to apologise ScoobyDoo, anyone please feel free to answer any questions here, this thread is about helping one another out :) <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg865929#msg865929">Quote from: NinHao on February 27, 2013, 09:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have been learning to use this GPG stuff for my mac, and I think that I have become very proficient at it.&nbsp; But, there is one thing perplexes me.&nbsp; I have to use my clipboard to paste and copy.&nbsp; Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn&#039;t this leave some sort of paper trail?&nbsp; I will pose this same question on the newbie pgp club as well.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Hello NinHao unfortunately I have no knowledge of mac, I haven&#039;t used a mac for over twenty years, I hope someone is able to assist you on the Newbie PGP Club soon.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg866046#msg866046">Quote from: NinHao on February 27, 2013, 10:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My buddy ordered from asia and his package was intercepted by customs.&nbsp; He never received a letter from customs.&nbsp; He was nervous for a while, then he forgot about it.&nbsp; 3 weeks later, a controlled delivery ensued.&nbsp; He was high as fuck, so when they came to the door, all he saw was a UPS man with a package.&nbsp; He asked are you &quot;John Doe?&quot; please sign here.&nbsp; Of course he used his real name.&nbsp; Being high as fuck, he said yeah and signed.&nbsp; Then he got blitzed by the feds with like 20 guns in his face. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m sorry to hear this happened to your friend, it&#039;s unlikely this would happen with a personal use size order, unless your in a country with very tough customs, such as the middle east, or a very large order.

Also, if your below a vendors transaction criteria some vendor&#039;s might require you to FE, of course this is up to you if you wish to do so or not. If you&#039;ve already placed an order with a vendor and it&#039;s not marked &#039;in transit&#039; within 96 hours you have the right to cancel it, your bitcoins held in escrow will be refunded. It&#039;s always best to do your research prior to placing an order, there&#039;s plenty of reputable vendors who are happy to entertain new members and escrow :) <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg866281#msg866281">Quote from: NinHao on February 27, 2013, 11:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They let him off really easy.&nbsp; He spent like 4 or 5 days in a local jail.&nbsp; I think they were just trying to scare him to giving up info, but he really didn&#039;t know anything.&nbsp; This was not on SR or BMR by the way.&nbsp; He was naive too.&nbsp; He really didn&#039;t take any precautions, because he didn&#039;t think that it was necessary.&nbsp; The seller told him not to worry since his purchases were small meaning they will likely go through easily.&nbsp; He was also advised to use real info, because fake info raises red flags.&nbsp; He just thought it was as simple as that.&nbsp; They mail you stuff, you get it, and you get stoned.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Happy to hear he was let off easy, if he still enjoys getting high I hope he uses SilkRoad in the future, and of course a new address ;)

No, MDMA does not go &#039;bad&#039;, providing you store it in a dark and dry place, MDMA is a very stable molecule, it can last for centuries. Best storage method is in a airtight, moisture proof, glass jar/vial, not a plastic ziplock bag it&#039;s not moisture proof or airtight.<br />

A lot of vendors require FE for new buyers with 5 purchases or fewer. Some don’t. They will state their policy on FE on their SR m (Silk Road marketplace) profile page. First thing I check when I don’t know a vendor is their profile page, whether they require a signature, and where they send. (Click on shipping options (I always do) to find both). Then I Search them on home page of SR forums, open another tab, and search for their official reviews page, read first and last pages of review thread, open another tab, click on profile and check their freshest page of posts, and at same time search freshest 2 pages of buyer FB on SR m. I also check on their best-selling and least-selling products and try and find out why. (Yeah, I usually have tabs open all over the bloody place, I also have TorMail open at same time, it sounds more work than it is, you get used it and you can get through info quicker as info is all side by side for comparison. If Tor is not playing up feel free to do it this way. But this is only for vendors I don’t know or who I hear have changed something recently.)<br /><br />If you absolutely have to FE then consider buying digital goods and then expand to drugs, it will allow some sales under your belt instantly.<br /><br />Anyone else feel free to expand on this.<br /><br />[Edit. Ah, I posted too late and this has already been answered. I’m still going to post it! Lulz.]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg866281#msg866281">Quote from: NinHao on February 27, 2013, 11:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">He was also advised to use real info, because fake info raises red flags.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It’s hard to get your drugs when you use an address that doesn’t exist. Temporarily vacant houses have been discussed before, so have PO boxes. Usually not a good idea but up to you. (Having said that, there&#039;s one SR buyer that has successfully used a PO box, and another who has used a temporarily vacant address.) Unless you authorise a GPS drop which we don’t really do around here. (Also, GPS drops are usually more expensive and problematic to boot. [edit. okay whatever]) A lot of vendors will want to deal with real humans with real names and real addresses, don’t believe me, ask them. Ask them on SR m and they’ll say “use your real details”. Very common question though.<br /><br />Anyone else feel free to expand on this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg866281#msg866281">Quote from: NinHao on February 27, 2013, 11:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">He was naive too.&nbsp; He really didn&#039;t take any precautions, because he didn&#039;t think that it was necessary.&nbsp; The seller told him not to worry since his purchases were small meaning they will likely go through easily.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like he didn&#039;t know what he was doing (seller not just buyer).

				Thanks for this thread. Of course I read it all and don&#039;t really have any questions but it&#039;s a great idea. I&#039;ve been using SR for several months but only started with the forum and just discovered this 50 post thing. Looks like it will be a little while longer for me to register my interest in a favourite vendor having something I definitely want.

				Thank you for your interest and your answer to my last question.&nbsp; I do have another if you don&#039;t mind.<br /><br />I have recently completed one of my first purchases on the road, and I wrote a review of my experience in the feedback box upon finalization.&nbsp; For some reason when I go to that vendors profile, my feedback does not show up in the list with the others, some of which are more recent now.&nbsp; When I check my account/my feedback it shows up along with other vendors I gave feedback for, so I know it posted.&nbsp; Is there a way for vendors to hide unwanted feedback?&nbsp; Is there a number of transactions you must make before your feedback becomes valid and public, similar to this forum?&nbsp; Or did I just type to much in the box and have it censored as spam?<br /><br />Thanks again<br />&nbsp;-CD

I was getting depressed by the overall &quot;&quot;quality&quot;&quot; of the newbie section i&#039;m trapped in.<br /><br />So here it goes :<br /><br />1) Are you a real princess ? Is SR your realm ?<br /><br />2) Are you HIGH all the time in order to keep that nickname ?<br /><br />3) When your &quot;feeling low&quot;, do you switch to a &quot;PrincessLOW&quot; account ?&nbsp; :D <br /><br />4) Is there a topic somewhere recapitulating data about success ratio for each country ? It would be great that some Top 5% vendors would accept to share their stats for each country.<br /><br />5) You mentionned some Bitcoins tumbler. I was thinking the SR tumbler was enough to hide the origin of my bitcoins. As a result, I wasn&#039;t really trying to buy my BTC anonymously. I just make 100% sure to request a new SR address everytime i make a deposit. Is it really achievable to track BTCs in SR ? For now my theory is that :<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - When you keep BTCs in your SR wallet, if SR ever gets shut down and investigated, they could possibly track the origin of BTC. Or maybe the tumbler was already used when crediting my account ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Once BTC are used to pay, they are &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;impossible&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; to track their origin to SR ?<br /><br />6) Would you mind giving me your opinion on this topic I made ? (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124653.msg855197#msg855197)<br />It was intended as a discussion on a &quot;standardized&quot; rating system that could be use to complete the current one. It was buried quite fast so unfortunately i have no idea if it&#039;s a bad or good idea.<br /><br />7) Even though I think there is many great sellers on SR, I keep thinking that statistically, one of the sellers I will use in the future will sooner or later get &quot;caught&quot; or go out in EnterTheMatrix/Tony76 style. I certainly hope not but there is not much very old sellers out there right ? What is the longest time a seller was active on SR ? In the event of a bust, how can we honestly think they took care of our personnal informations ?<br />There is plenty of ways to store &quot;by mistake&quot; some client information. Take simply a seller printing your address ? What program would be used ? Does this program keeps history ? If the seller is using Windows, is there any trace remaining of my order ? Do &quot;Yellow dots&quot; have been checked for by the seller ? I don&#039;t want to sound too paranoid as in the end I will order anyway from SR. But we got to notice that simply printing an address on a label can create tons of traces all around. On a windows system, simply copy/pasting a text will create a log entry somewhere.<br />TL;DR --&gt; Do you think Top rated vendors really take this confidentiality work seriously ? I reassure myself thinking that&#039;s in their interest to do so. Just because if one day they got to explain themselves to LE they will be not proof of the amount of customers they served.<br /><br />8) Some people tend to say that &quot;signed&quot; order are not that much dangerous since UPS/Fedex do no spend much time checking packages. On the other hand, UPS wouldn&#039;t hesitate a second to hand other the package to LE if they were asked to. What&#039;s your opinion about this ? Are &quot;box&quot; like packages much more risky than letters ?<br /><br />9) Are sellers aware that pre-vacuuming orders a long time before sending them is a big security breach ? :p<br /><br />Well i think that&#039;s enough for today. Sorry for the long post and again, thanks a lot for this topic PrincessHIGH. Highly appreciated :)

This is not Ebay, or Amazon, this is SilkRoad, what kind of marketplace is this? An anonymous marketplace! What do we need to protect? Our anonymity! All information should stay anonymous and all statistics when it comes to the incomings and outgoings should remain withheld, unless you personally choose to disclose some information about yourself, which you do at your own risk (like some members choose to disclose their purchasing stats in their signatures). If you&#039;re concerned about ordering from x vendor from x country do your research on the forum as a way of gauging their success rate.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg868821#msg868821">Quote from: anonom on February 28, 2013, 08:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> 5) You mentionned some Bitcoins tumbler.

Because I believe SilkRoad&#039;s mixer is an in-house mixer meaning that all the wallet addresses that are used to tumble are SilkRoad wallets, in the instance SilkRoad&#039;s database was ever breached this information could be compromised, leaked, and possibly be traced back to you. The only way you can truly purchase Bitcoins 99.9% anonymously is with cold hard cash through the post.

Also marks out of 10 on stealth/packing is in direct violation of the SilkRoad rules, nobody is allowed to speak of the vendors stealth methods, it compromises the vendor and it compromises you.

				Morning Princess!! ;) You wouldn&#039;t be so kind as to quote this review over into mahakala&#039;s review thread would you?<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I purhcased 100mg of 2C-B from mahakala. Excited to try my first psychedelic (albeit a &#039;light&#039; one) and a fairly experienced MDMA user, I was really up for a great time and this stuff did not disappoint!!<br /><br />I dosed out 4 x 15mg doses (this is by eye so I may have been slightly under/above) and myself and 3 friends took them at 10:30pm just before heading off to see a really sick DJ in town.<br /><br />After maybe t+1:00 I felt a sort of lightness in my upper half, and when walking upstairs in the club my legs felt pretty heavy. Something was happening but nothing crazy.<br /><br />After about t+1:45 I was a bit worried, as I wasn&#039;t feeling anything more than this slight lightness mentioned above. I did, at points, feel odd sort of waves through my body. It was as if I was being pushed off balance but everything tilted with me. Slightly reminiscent of Ket, but this was only at brief moments. Little did I know that wouldn&#039;t be an issue soon. At t+2:00 it started to make an impact. There was a lovely undercurrent of euphoria and what I can only think to call a buzz to everything, but on top of this there was an intensification of colours and everything seemed to have a great glow to it. The vibrations of the music felt incredible as they went through my body, and I felt a real oneness with the music. Another really interesting thing was how a few people dropped their glasses in the club, and I would hear the noise really significantly - it would be the clearest and most impressive noise around - but it would be layered on top of the rest of the noise. Everything seemed to have a sort of separateness that was also combined. It&#039;s very difficult to articulate, even now, when I am writing this at t+5:30 hours after dosing.<br /><br />We met some really cool guys and girls and had a proper old boogy and had a blast after that. <br /><br />By t+4:00 we all felt as if we were coming down a little. It was all very smooth, and the transition back to &#039;reality&#039; still had a very nice, positive edge to it all. The DJ finished his set and I got to talk to him for a second or two and it was all really cool. I fed off of other people&#039;s energy quite a lot and everyone was all really positive, making for a really good time.<br /><br />We all agreed that 15mg was the right dosage. The club was pretty hectic and it would have been a bit too much to deal with for a first time with a psychedelic (for all of us) if we had dosed higher. Myself and another friend had a really good time on it, whereas the other two guys felt it - but not as much. I think this is important with 2c-b: that the doses can vary from person to person. I&#039;m glad I erred on the side of caution, though - it&#039;s always better to do too little than too much.<br /><br />My friend and I who felt it most are planning on doing a 20mg dose in a chilled environment soon, watching some TopCat and Futurama or something and having a more relaxed, introspective time on it. <br /><br />All in all, it was an absolutely great first experience - all very clean and I felt my headspace was pretty sober and clear for most of the time (apart from those few wobbly moments).<br /><br />So guys - I recommend you go to Mahakala for your 2c-b needs!! A very good price for a really good time. Quick delivery, good stealth, fantastic product. I can&#039;t recommend it enough!<br /><br />Peace and love, tda.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Big love if you can help me help him!! Peace xx

				Can you read my resolution center messages between me and XTCEXPRESS and tell me if you think I will get my money back?<br />Read it from the bottom so it makes sense, the top is the most recent.<br />Transaction details<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; item: 25X Heart 120-130mg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; quantity: 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; buyer: ninjahands1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; seller: X T C E X P R E S S<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; date shipped: February 13, 2013, 9:22 pm UTC<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />You say that was a &quot;thing of the past&quot; EXACTLY my order is from a month ago. AKA The Past. As you can see in the messages I mentioned the cardboard slit. This disproves any weight measurement precautions that you might take. I am clueless to why it was in there, but it was.<br /><br />Look guys, I would like to apologize. I became hasty with my responses and I was in anger from our miscommunication and what I truly believe and know to be an empty package. I could have just as easily claimed that I opened the package and I was the one who discovered it was empty. However, I was not that person. Like I mentioned earlier my colleague was. I have no reason to lie about anything. If this were the case I would have just lied and claimed I was the one who opened it. For all we know someone may have taken the contents out while it was on route. Who knows.<br /><br />This will be the last message I post in the resolution center regarding this case. I firmly believe I am entitled to my full refund, however, I will retract my statements I previously made about this seller&#039;s reputation (Not my specific case). I do truly believe that XTC is a honorable vendor I just wish things would have gone right between us from the get-go so I could do more business with him. XTC this is to you directly. I am going to remove everything I posted on the forums regarding our case. I am also sincerely apologizing for becoming what you believed to be hostile. I hope you can accept my apology. I do not expect this to influence any refund, resolution, or decision in any way. I am just being as professional as possible at this point in hopes to earn your respect back.<br /><br />We have not been able to come to a conclusion so let&#039;s leave this up to the admins now that we have both stated our case.<br /><br />Thanks SR Admin, Thanks XTCEXPRESS. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ninjahands1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 seconds<br />March 13, 2013, 12:20 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br />0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can keep going like this, won&#039;t take you anywhere.<br /><br />We don&#039;t send out empty packages, all packages get weight before adding postage. A empty package weighs nothing compared<br />to a loaded package. This is a mistake like i said never happend in thousands of orders. Such a claim along your 100% cashback request on site made this situation. Claiming to have received a empty package and filing for a 100% refund is to obvious. None of your &quot;ninjahands&quot; in my pocket...<br /><br />Don&#039;t talk BS about our feedback score, we are about the only seller which sends to problem countries like australia finland and new zealand no questions asked<br />which makes it much harder to maintain this high feedback but we are climbing. You have absolutely no idea it seems to me how things work for a seller. Yes we had delays and yes some people rated us lower than normal. But is allready beeing a thing of the past. Your just trying to make us look bad to get as much out of it.<br /><br />This is all because you received your order too late you thought let&#039;s screw them over, now you gotta stick to your story i understand that. But&#039;s not going to work it will be a 0.0% refund...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X T C E X P R E S S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 minutes<br />March 13, 2013, 11:57 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept<br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have been so hostile about this whole ordeal. I was really being rude by extending your shipment time by 20 days right from the beginning no questions asked.<br /><br />**********I have decided to extend the due date 10 more days only because this vendor has been very helpful and communicating with me well. I wouldn&#039;t normally do this for any vendor but I feel XTCEXPRESS brings a lot to the table. Looking forward to receiving!<br /><br />Seller has been in contact and notified me that they were revamping their facilities and would be behind on orders. Has been very prompt and communicated well thus far. I have decided to extend the date 10 more days to be safe. If the package does not arrive within the next 10 days then I will expect a refund.<br /><br />Thanks.**************<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I did not become hostile or even angry in one way until the point where I realized I was lied to about the false shipment date. My whole conversation with you up until this point was nothing but polite! All of the Points you just made in your most recent case against me in your response are senseless. Obviously the person reviewing our case will be able to see our messages and can clearly see that I was not aggressive or hostile in any way until I was done wrong, then it became my right to be angry. Oh and as far as your 1/5 if you would actually read your messages before accusing me of scamming I clearly stated. In one of my last messages to you personally.<br /><br />&quot;You will earn a 5/5 from me for honesty &amp; communication&quot;<br /><br />This was until all of the accusations and poor customer service on your part. You caused that, not me. Even while receiving NO product I was still willing to leave a 5/5 but now YOU are the one responsible for bringing a 1/5 on yourself for the way you handled all of this, or should I say attempted to handle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ninjahands1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53 minutes<br />March 13, 2013, 11:26 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br />0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your pathetic trying to have the last words here, influence a admin as much you can.<br />You have had enough space to display all your jibberish leading away from the core of this resolution.<br /><br />My stand:<br /><br />* Buyer received package<br />* Did not receive the package him/her self no telling if that person took it. (customer claims to have received a empty package)<br />* Rude and inpolite right from the start, never came across such a rude client<br />* We have a policy which is very clear, you comply with all the terms and way we work in general.<br />* Since this buyer want to resolve in hostile way, this becomes a principal case which we like to see 0% refund. To make<br />this person clear he doesn&#039;t have any form of leverage. He will leave feedback of 1of5 anyway so with 0% refund makes it even.<br /><br /><br />Thanks and sorry for wasting your time admin on such....<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X T C E X P R E S S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 hour<br />March 13, 2013, 10:46 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept<br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nearing time for the resolution to be decided on. I hope I have provided enough evidence to prove my case in asking for a full refund. If the person reviewing this case has any questions please feel free to message me and they will be answered ASAP. The vendor has made no more attempts to resolve my issue, nor has he been in contact at all. He has exhibited poor customer service since I opened this resolution.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;When you say your ordered to someone else his name and<br />address you allready made a mistake there.&quot;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If the vendor would please consult the SR wiki it actually suggest NOT sending it to your actual address and name, but rather to another trusted colleague or accomplice. I fail to see how this is a violation in any way since it is actually the method that the SR staff suggest in plain text. Especially considering the address and name used were 100% real. The only reason I even had him open the package is so if the product would have been in there I could have released your payment in a timely manner. I hope the SR staff will take everything in this situation into consideration such as the delays, lies, and no product. Also please look at some of the reviews on the sellers profile as well as the forums. I am not the only person reporting not receiving their product. I hope the right decision will be made and I can spend my money with another vendor on the road who knows how to conduct business properly.<br /><br />No matter how the resolution works out I would like it to be noted that I want a 1/5 review left for this vendor on my behalf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ninjahands1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 hours<br />March 13, 2013, 8:59 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well as it happens, this colleague of mine has received far more expensive packages than yours with no problems whatsoever, hence why I have no other refunds or resolution center problems in the past. Look at your slowly decreasing feedback, if you will check the forums that you are not active on, you would see that around the time mine should have been received people had been throwing away the pills you sent them because they were bunk.<br /><br />&quot;Jibberish to scam as much as I can&quot; Haha yes, 200$ is such a high dollar amount to scam someone for. Wow maybe I can retire and buy a home off of the coast if I win this! What a joke, maybe you should consider not LYING about your shipping time, not sending out BUNK products, and not sending out EMPTY packages when you are out of product! That would be a good start to the whole process. There are no &quot;lies&quot; on my end. This person has successfully received everyone of my other orders, many worth more than yours. Why would he have any reason to lie about this one.<br /><br />Please DO put my name on your blacklist. Your service is so unbelievably poor and slow it is unreal. I can only imagine the product I would have received.<br /><br />I am not even worried at all about the $200 I would rather the SR staff get it than you. You have not earned one single dollar of it in any way whatsoever or I would have no problems releasing it. Also, even if you do happen to win that measly amount of change your reputation on the forums is still going to be tarnished. Not just from me, but the other dissatisfied customers.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t lie to your customers about when you actually ship your products. Our case aside, these people will check their mailbox constantly in false hopes if you give them the wrong shipping date. This is really not right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ninjahands1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days<br />March 10, 2013, 10:10 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br />0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,<br /><br />Absolute nonsense, you received a empty package but not really you because you were not around for delivery<br />but a real real colleague of yours... Sorry but this is just jibberish to scam as much out of this as you can.<br /><br />We don&#039;t send empty packages didn&#039;t happen over thousands of orders. When you say your ordered to someone else his name and<br />address you allready made a mistake there. We are not responsible for you losing product to an colleague of yours which just steals it from you.<br /><br />We always provide options to resolve but in this case we won&#039;t we are not responsible if you were so stupid to have your order get stolen or you just lying to get as much out if it. Either way this final we won&#039;t refund anything.

I am asking for a full refund of my items price. I will list the problems that are also touched on in the messages.<br />1. Lied about shipping date.<br />2. Sent a package with no pills whatsoever, not one.<br />3. VERY delayed shipping time even if it would have had something in it.<br /><br />*Please note the address of delivery to which I refer to in my messages which I was not present was completely real with a real name and a willing colleague of mine.<br /><br />I will leave this up to the SR admins because they do this better than anyone. All the evidence to make a case for a refund is in my messages. Where there is no way to prove that there was no product in there there is a way to prove where the lies started. (in the messages) I get the strange feeling that they ran out of stock when relocating, either packaged nothing instead of something on accident, or purposefully sent me nothing because they didn&#039;t have my product in stock when they were supposed to be shipping it.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Guys<br /><br />Read from the bottom up*<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ninjahands1 Package was received and confirmed to contain no pills whatsoever.Not one single pill. Only a cardboard slit. I took apart every single centimeter of tape, cardboard, and envelope and no pills. I would be able to notice 25 pills in an envelope I don&#039;t care how good the stealth is. I have the feeling someone just messed up when packaging it. I would like a full refund of my money. You will earn a 5/5 from me for honesty &amp; communication. I will be asking for 100% refund at the resolution center. 35 seconds unread<br /><br />ninjahands1 I received my long awaited package today, it is at a place I am not present at and the person who opened it claimed there was only a cardboard slit inside it and no pills. Where are they? I am trying to explain to him but your stealth is so good he cannot find them. That or there aren&#039;t any pills in there at all. 1 day unread<br /><br />X T C E X P R E S S(94) Hi,<br /><br />Thank you for your message and getting this straight :)<br />Lets hope they will arrive soon.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />X T C E X P R E S S 7 days read<br /><br />ninjahands1 No no my friend!

That was the date reported by you originally... I am not too agitated about the length of shipping but more disappointed in the dishonesty. If you don&#039;t ship it on that day please don&#039;t claim that you did. I will report this back in the forums respectively. I will also notify the resolution center if it comes to that. I will extend your time requirement yet another 10 more days. I realize you have moved your facility and respect that, however I don&#039;t believe it justifies false info. I am in DESPERATE need of a large bulk MDMA vendor and I ordered the hearts just to test the waters with you guys.

				Hello. I&#039;m a noob. A seller messaged me to tell me to FE the order and I don&#039;t want to. Can I cancel the order and get my coin back or is it up to him? He&#039;s not read my message requesting a cancellation and its been a whole day.

I noticed you&#039;ve revealed your marketplace account name, you may wish to censor this if you don&#039;t want it to be known on the forum. If you are not the only one who has received an empty package from X T C X P R E S S you need to subit these links to the resoultion centre, if there are many it might sway the resolution centre to look favourably on your proposal. Are you 100% sure that the address you sent it to did not intercept/steal your contents? It&#039;s very wrong of the vendor to make an order &#039;in transit&#039; when it&#039;s not, it&#039;s very misleading and as far as I&#039;m aware a violation of the rules. If you have perfect stats and there&#039;s other evidence of others receiving empty packages I hope a 100% refund will be awarded to you but the admin may decide to award 50% because there&#039;s a chance your package may have been intercepted by your friend, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll receive 0%. Based on your case X T C E X P R E S S seriously needs to improve their customer service, ongoing resolution ping pong is very unprofessional. Your last message says you were extending ten days on march 1st,&nbsp; has X T C X P R E S S provided you with a new tracking number, if not make another proosal for a refund and make &#039;SR Support&#039; aware of it. I wish you all the best for a satisfactory resolution White 0ut :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg895269#msg895269">Quote from: doodoomonster on March 13, 2013, 03:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thank you so much!

Each spam post on this thread not only clutters it, but stops anyone with real questions from getting their answers. A lot of these questions are important and they need get their answers quickly as a lot is often at stake here with avoiding jail time and large transactions. Look for the word &#039;spam&#039; in other threads and spam your heart out.<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding.<br /><br />And thank you PrincessHIGH for letting me post here. :)

Firstly, the vendor shouldn&#039;t have marked your order &#039;in transit&#039; if the vendor has done this prior to dispatching your order this is a violation of the rules, you need to bring this to the admin&#039;s attention either through &#039;SR Support&#039; or via clicking on the &#039;report this vendor&#039; link on the vendor&#039;s main page, you may need to give admin time to respond but they will get back to you, I wish you all the best for a satisfactory resolution.

The main reason I believe why the &#039;Newbie discussion&#039; board was created alongside the fifty post rule is to restrict the Bitcoin spambot from flooding the boards with it&#039;s onslaught, when I say onslaught I mean there used to be 1000&#039;s of spam messages here everyday almost 24/7, it was unbearable, the poor moderators had their resources stretched to the hilt, it was no fun being forced trawl through pages of spam (sometimes up to ten pages) just to get to the genuine threads, it&#039;s a lot better now. You can either start up your own spam thread and spam your way to fifty, it&#039;s a very popular thing to do here, or you can use your time here for insight and learning, please if you haven&#039;t already done so visit this sticky &#039;Newbie PGP Club&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0 it&#039;s highly advisable you learn PGP prior to placing your first order. If you need assistance with posting a review to a vendor&#039;s review thread on the &#039;Rumor Mill&#039; I will happily quote it on your behalf if you wish me to. I wish you happy travels ahead :) <br />Edit: If you wish to read about the Bitcoin spambot scam you can do so here &#039;A Warning for New Members About Bitcoin Scams&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108836.0<br />&nbsp;

				Hello anyone, I recently ordered a 2 packages of JWH smoking blend from a very reputable seller, the first package shipped on a Monday and arrived on Friday. The second package shipped on tuesday and has not arrived yet. It has been 10 days and I&#039;ve started to get a tiny bit paranoid. I&#039;m not that attached to the product and it wouldn&#039;t be the end of the world if I didn&#039;t get it. Here&#039;s my problem; I really want to order some 25x and was wondering if it would be safe, I figure even if my mail is being looked through or my address has been flagged or something, 25x isn&#039;t illegal and wouldn&#039;t get me in trouble if it was found in my mail. Anyone have any advice or am I being stupid?

				1. How do I edit a feedback that i left last nite (so I can let ppl know the quality of the product) ?<br />2. Is there a suggestion thread for suggestions for this site (like &quot;sort by price feature&quot; etc) that DPR reads or checks up on every once in awhile?<br />&nbsp;I really would like to see another decimal place in the bitcoins amount. With .01 BTC being equal to a dollar, it wud be easier if we had another decimal place as alot of vendors list their items at $1.50 or $2.50 a pill and i buy a bunch of pills and end up spending $2 or $3 each because its only in increments of .01 (so either .02 or .03 but no .025)

				I&#039;ve been wondering if there is a way for LE to trace BTCs going from Mt Gox straight into your SR wallet? I mean, can they actually tell that that wallet belongs to SR?<br /><br />After being phished on Instawallet, I&#039;d read that some roadies send it straight through from MtGox to SR, since SR tumbles it. Any advice on why we should be shuffling our BTC&#039;s around before depositing on SR would be appreciated.

Simple cashing out is easy. If the transaction is derived from Silk Road then enjoy your stay in prison if you do this without basic laundering. But.... you already know this. At time of writing BTC average is $108.00 USD and Weighted Average is $102.78 USD, so $10,800.00 and $10,278.00 rough cashout respectively without fees.. ‘Maintaining anonymity while using Bitcoins’ at Link **CLEARNET ALERT**&nbsp; http://thedailyattack.com/2011/06/16/maintaining-anonymity-while-using-bitcoins gives a quick rundown on some basics of bitcoin anonymity. (Ignore the conspiracy theories from the paranoid writer) Read it all or skip to ‘Mixing’. Drill on this site for more information. <br /><br />Specific or detailed laundering information is usually given over PM, not on main. Limetless provides a consulting service in this regard last time I checked, but he’s not back yet, and you can also PM vendors you are friendly with for a few quick pointers if not too time-demanding. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg958110#msg958110">Quote from: NCChronic on March 30, 2013, 08:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi.

				Since I&#039;m not able to post in my vendor thread yet, I&#039;m posting this here. I am extremely sorry that some of my customers have not been receiving their packages. I have no intention of scamming anyone, as I have been accused of. I sent out a test shipment and it was not received either. It&#039;s very confusing to me as to why so many packages have not arrives. I have decided to offer anyone who hasn&#039;t received their order a reship with 25% extra product, or an extra sample in they had only ordered one sample. Please put your address is the resolution center window. <br /><br />If you have already finalized early, please send me what you ordered along with your address and I will reship with 25% extra, or if you ordered a sample, I will double that.<br /><br />I would like to make this right with every, and again I apologize for what has happened.<br /><br />My assistant and I are working on a better system and if anyone has helpful suggestions, we would like to hear them.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Question #1:<br />I am nearing my first USD to Bitcoin conversion. I&#039;ve read through about four pages of this thread and have found a lot of wonderful information about washing Bitcoins (BlockChain) as well as other useful information. So, my question: Will purchasing Bitcoins with a prepaid gift/debit card bought (cash) far from my place of residence provide enough buffer to avoid the necessity of washing services? Am I right in assuming so? Or should I just play it safe and pay the percentage to BlockChain for anonymity?<br /><br />Question #2:<br />While this does not relate to buying or selling, it does relate to anonymity. I currently connect to a VPN (AirVPN) and then launch TOR. Is this a good precaution or an unnecessary expense?<br /><br />Thank you for your efforts. While I am brand new here I realize the scope and importance of this thread. We are all grateful for you giving us your time.

				No, not your bitwallet address, probably some Moneygram company called ZipZap Inc. Then, ZipZap can transfer your cash instantly (almost instantly) to Mt. Gox and from your Mt Gox account you can buy bitcoins and from your Mt Gox account you can trasnfer your coins to your Silk Road account (or go thru to a tumbler if you want to be careful). Then once your coins are in Silk Road, you can start buying drugs! Its that simple

				VirWoX takes CCs and PayPal, but their fees are a little high, and there is a delay before you&#039;re allowed to withdraw your BTC purchased with either of these in order to prevent chargebacks. But if you absolutely need to buy your coins with one of those, VirWoX is probably the way to do it.<br /><br />Clearnet link: https://www.virwox.com

Am I right in assuming so? Or should I just play it safe and pay the percentage to BlockChain for anonymity?<br /><br />Question #2:<br />While this does not relate to buying or selling, it does relate to anonymity. I currently connect to a VPN (AirVPN) and then launch TOR. Is this a good precaution or an unnecessary expense?<br /><br />Thank you for your efforts.

I&#039;ve answered your second question in response to dannymayhem1&#039;s question, it&#039;s my first answer at the top of this post. You can +/- another members karma every 72/96 hours when you become a &#039;Full Member&#039; at 100 posts, if the member makes a post you approve of you can [thank] + them and if the member makes a post you disapprove of you can [discourage] - them. Also, rather than making two posts in a short space of time you can make them into one post by clicking the &#039;Modify&#039; link (pencil and paper icon) at the top right of your post, though you may want two posts now to help you reach your fifty posts, just for future reference :)<br />Please keep the questions coming in, I&#039;m always happy to help if I can. Enjoy the rest of your sundays everyone or if your on the other side of the dateline I wish you a great week ahead :)

The main reason why Bitcoins have almost doubled in price is because the mined blocks have halved from 50 to 25 on november 25th 2012, meaning the miners have to work twice as hard for the same amount of Bitcoins, I believe they were selling their surplus stock from the mined 50 blocks up until six weeks ago, when the 50 block supply was exhausted in came the 25 blocks, also remember the majority of us here don&#039;t purchase our coins directly from the miners, it&#039;s a tiered system, the miners supply the traders, and the traders supply the consumers, everyone takes a cut which adds to the rapid rise of Bitcoin. There&#039;s a vendor called DrugsAndCash http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119929.msg813883#msg813883 who is selling at €15.50, I can&#039;t personally recommend him as I have never used his service, you&#039;ll need to talk to him and decide for yourself, I&#039;ve sent the link you&#039;re way as he might be able to save you some €&#039;s. The majority of vendors peg their listings to the U.S dollar meaning it hasn&#039;t become anymore expensive to purchase than it was before, meaning when the exchange for US $ inflates the price of Bitcoin deflates. If you ever need a quick and accurate way to find out how much your listing is in € I&#039;d recommend (clearwebalert) coinmill.com/BTC_EUR.html I hope you find my answer helpful :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, I haven&#039;t read the rest of this thread to see if this has been updated, and I could be wrong, but I think the reason bitcoins keep raising in value is due to speculation.&nbsp; There was an article in the Economist in September, and since then people have been speculating tremendously.&nbsp; (clearnet) http://www.economist.com/node/21563752&nbsp; Bitcoin blockchains are systematically cut in half every 6 months I believe?&nbsp; I think because the blockchains become more difficult to solve, so this is a way of evening out the time it take to create a bitcoin.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it has anything to do with the valuation of bitcoins.<br /><br />Some people think this is a speculation bubble, and I tend to agree.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll pop right now, but I do think it will pop.&nbsp; Just a heads up for newbies or anyone else not familiar with bitcoins.&nbsp; The idea of bitcoins is very confusing to some people, rightly so.&nbsp; I get the main ideas, but it still can be very confusing.<br /><br />Sorry if this is misinformation, take it with a grain of salt and do your own research.. but even expert economists don&#039;t know how much bitcoins will rise or if/when they will plummet.<br /><br />Thanks for this great thread princess!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to have a place that I don&#039;t have to spam.&nbsp; One thought just occurred to me.&nbsp; Maybe they should make it an option to the user who starts the thread whether or not newbies should be allowed to post.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a thought.&nbsp; Take care!

Today Bitcoin broke the £100 barrier for this first time, the &#039;Mt Gox High Price&#039; (clearwebalert) mtgox.com/index.html?Currency=USD is presently $156.80 (as of 14.05 pm UTC). Bitcoin quite stable the past 48 hours but looks like it&#039;s incling again, how high will it go who knows, &#039;when&#039; and &#039;if&#039; the bubble will burst who knows, it&#039;s all pies in the sky in the moment! If you&#039;re feeling bullish have a little investment, chances are you might do better than investing in the banks with their lousy rates of interest, however I&#039;m not saying go &#039;all in&#039;, only invest what you can afford to loose, I believe it&#039;s worth a shot especially considering the global economic situation the way it stands presently. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg986753#msg986753">Quote from: sillybastard on April 07, 2013, 01:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Thanks for this great thread princess!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to have a place that I don&#039;t have to spam.&nbsp; One thought just occurred to me.&nbsp; Maybe they should make it an option to the user who starts the thread whether or not newbies should be allowed to post.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a thought.&nbsp; Take care! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> You&#039;re welcome and thank-you for your kind words.

I&#039;ve never used Bitinstant or MtGox as I&#039;m not from your part of the world, however I suggest you do not hand over any documentation to MtGox however you&#039;ve got Bitcoins stuck in limbo there, so in a way you&#039;re being held over a barrel. Handing over documents seriously compromises your anonymity, you need to consider what&#039;s worth more your anonymity or the Bitcoins. Please don&#039;t withdraw to SilkRoad from MtGox, please put your Bitcoins through a tumbler directed to your SilkRoad wallet, especially if MtGox is going to be in possession of your documents. I hope someone with more experience of MtGox and this situation can shed some light. I wish you all the best resolving your dilemma :)

				Hi,<br /><br />So a friend of mine told me about SR, and I am very interested in what it has to offer.&nbsp; However, since I have started reading about how I get coin the price has gone from £30 or so pounds to current £102+ on MtGox.&nbsp; From what I have been told, the process of getting my GBP into coin and from there into SR takes time.&nbsp; My concern is that in that time, the coin that I have bought is now only worth a fraction of the value I purchased it at.<br /><br />Or is there something else at work here that I do not understand?<br /><br />Thanks for your help...

Today Bitcoin broke the £100 barrier for this first time, the &#039;Mt Gox High Price&#039; (clearwebalert) mtgox.com/index.html?Currency=USD is presently $156.80 (as of 14.05 pm UTC). Bitcoin quite stable the past 48 hours but looks like it&#039;s incling again, how high will it go who knows, &#039;when&#039; and &#039;if&#039; the bubble will burst who knows, it&#039;s all pies in the sky in the moment! If you&#039;re feeling bullish have a little investment, chances are you might do better than investing in the banks with their lousy rates of interest, however I&#039;m not saying go &#039;all in&#039;, only invest what you can afford to loose, I believe it&#039;s worth a shot especially considering the global economic situation the way it stands presently. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg986753#msg986753">Quote from: sillybastard on April 07, 2013, 01:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> Thanks for this great thread princess!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to have a place that I don&#039;t have to spam.&nbsp; One thought just occurred to me.&nbsp; Maybe they should make it an option to the user who starts the thread whether or not newbies should be allowed to post.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a thought.&nbsp; Take care! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> You&#039;re welcome and thank-you for your kind words.

				It&#039;s not too bad right now.&nbsp; Gox has my cash, and is not locked in bitcoin.&nbsp; Having to get verified is a little discomforting though.&nbsp; I will take a look at what you meant by &quot;tumbler&quot;.&nbsp; Anyone have suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />&nbsp;[/quote] Hello 945wildman, I&#039;m happy to hear you like this thread and are benefiting from it, I enjoy reaching out and helping our community whenever I can. I&#039;ve never used Bitinstant or MtGox as I&#039;m not from your part of the world, however I suggest you do not hand over any documentation to MtGox however you&#039;ve got Bitcoins stuck in limbo there, so in a way you&#039;re being held over a barrel. Handing over documents seriously compromises your anonymity, you need to consider what&#039;s worth more your anonymity or the Bitcoins. Please don&#039;t withdraw to SilkRoad from MtGox, please put your Bitcoins through a tumbler directed to your SilkRoad wallet, especially if MtGox is going to be in possession of your documents. I hope someone with more experience of MtGox and this situation can shed some light. I wish you all the best resolving your dilemma :)<br />[/quote]

				@Interrestrial I have been looking into this myself, and I am very tempted to use (clearnet) https://localbitcoins.com - it seems to offer good protection for both buyer and seller, and the bit I like is that there is no paper trail to the bitcoins...&nbsp; I have yet to actually try it though

I don&#039;t know which exchange rate SilkRoad bases on, however I think it may be this &#039;Bitcoincharts 24h&#039; (clearwebalert)&nbsp; http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/currencies/ It is highly unlikely the value of Bitcoin is going to plummet from £124.98 (the MtGox last price it is now) to £30 within the time you transfer your Bitcoins, in fact I&#039;d bet Bitcoins on it not happening! If you&#039;re concerned about Bitcoin&#039;s volatility only purchase the amount of Bitcoins you require and spend them as soon as you receive them that way you safeguard yourself from market fluctuations.

How many people have access to an address other than their own for the purpose of getting drugs sent to? Not that many I&#039;d wager.<br /><br />Yet, I actually do have the option of a different address to use. However, the person who lives at said address does not (obviously) want their name on any packages, and it would be stupid for me to use my own for many reasons. What we are thinking is that we will use a fictional business address, like ABC Computers, 1 Some Road, etc. Any thoughts, PH or anyone?

				Sorry for taking awhile to reply, time has been flying for me and I didn&#039;t realise it&#039;s been so long, I&#039;m back and ready to rock and roll :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg994203#msg994203">Quote from: pigglemoo on April 09, 2013, 01:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Thanks Princess, this is a really helpful thread<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking on here for a while and really want to start buying on SR but am quite paranoid! I am also from the UK and was wondering where I should get my goods delivered? Do you use your home address, or a PO Box, or somewhere else? If I used a PO Box I presume I&#039;d need a fake ID?<br /><br />Thanks so much&nbsp; x x </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg994273#msg994273">Quote from: Intraterrestrial on April 09, 2013, 02:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Been wondering what&#039;s the norm re this issue too.<br /><br />Have seen quite a bit of advice to send to a different address but under your real name. How many people have access to an address other than their own for the purpose of getting drugs sent to? Not that many I&#039;d wager.<br /><br />Yet, I actually do have the option of a different address to use. However, the person who lives at said address does not (obviously) want their name on any packages, and it would be stupid for me to use my own for many reasons. What we are thinking is that we will use a fictional business address, like ABC Computers, 1 Some Road, etc. Any thoughts, PH or anyone? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> If you&#039;re ordering &#039;small amounts&#039; for personal use and live somewhere where it is highly unlikely for your post to be intercepted you should feel safe to use your own name/address, especially for domestic orders it&#039;s highly unlikely your order is going to be intercepted as it does not pass through customs, even the packages that do pass through customs they&#039;re unlikely to be intercepted if the vendor&#039;s stealth is sound. In my personal opinion using &#039;your&#039; real name or &#039;a&#039; real name associated to the address is better as it makes it look less suspicious. I&#039;ve read that PO Boxes can undergo higher scrutiny but cannot say this for certain. Some members have different &#039;drop&#039; addresses or rely upon &#039;friends&#039; but then you need to have a level of trust with that friend. Using your real name/address in the instance that something was intercepted will be hard to prove, they&#039;d need to prove you are the one who placed the order, and on Tor where everyone is anonymous that would be near impossible. I will reiterate for &#039;personal use&#039; amounts you haven&#039;t got too much to worry about, just be sensible in your choice of name and address. Best of luck with your purchases and happy travels ahead :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg997261#msg997261">Quote from: pigglemoo on April 10, 2013, 07:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Giving this a bump because it&#039;s such a useful thread and I want to know what UKers do about shipping...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Thank-you pigglemoo, hope you find the above answer helpful :) <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg997407#msg997407">Quote from: mnminc2010 on April 10, 2013, 08:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> whats the best way to just post on a thread i have been on the road for 3 months and leave detailed feedback there but feel as if im shorting a vendor by not posting on his thread whats this 50 posts thing and how do i reply with out quoting someone pgp was much easier than this </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Thank-you for your question mnminc2010 I can empathise with the frustrations of newbies who cannot post a review,&nbsp; I set up a thread a while back to help remedy&nbsp; this issue where I will quote your review to the vendor&#039;s review thread &#039;The official Newbies discussion &#039;Post Your Review Here&#039; thread! &#039; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120309.0 You won&#039;t need this as you have surpassed fifty posts since you asked this question, I&#039;ve posted it for the benefit of all who need it, I believe reviews are so important not just for the vendor reputation but for us as a community to make informed decisions. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg997903#msg997903">Quote from: joolz on April 10, 2013, 11:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> yes I showed Sr his messages threatening me, I didnt F.e stayed in Escrow and he still got a 50% Refund...hows that&nbsp; I and many others have reported him and hes still here ...hows that? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> It&#039;s the resolution centers decision I&#039;m afraid I cannot speak on behalf of their choice, the only option you&#039;d have now is to try and get the other 50% refunded directly from the vendor as I believe the resolution center&#039;s decision is final.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg1001160#msg1001160">Quote from: sofish89 on April 11, 2013, 03:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">what was the longest you heard of an order taking to ship from the EU to the US?

Enjoy your negs. ;) This thread has been created by Princess to help you new newbies. If you waste her time with stupid comments like this and questions on how big her rack is then not only will you be negged but you will find yourself isolated in future from having your slightly more pertinent questions answered by her, as Silk Road and its forums is too big not to have the option of placing someone on Iggy and going off to help other members who are more deserving, or have a higher brain cell count. <br /><br />My advice to people on this thread is that Princess is a long-standing vet with experience on Silk Road that goes well beyond her Join Date, which very few vendors here can compete with. There are a lot of vendors here who are still learning the ropes and who simply cannot answer drug use and tech questions to the standard that Princess can, and if you waste her time then it will only mean that she will be less inclined to help when you really need her. <br /><br />Also, I would like to know anyone on Silk Road who could actually compete with her level of knowledge and expertise, let alone be prepared to make themselves available to patiently answer questions on a frequent basis. This includes mods and admin who, from experience, are not always &quot;there&quot; to help with new members&#039; many questions to the degree their job description would have you believe. If Princess cannot get back to you with an answer on a SENSIBLE question, then good luck finding out elsewhere.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I wish you all the best with your first purchase and happy travels ahead :)<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg1045513#msg1045513">Quote from: sofish89 on April 23, 2013, 05:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg1044319#msg1044319">Quote from: Razorspyne on April 23, 2013, 05:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.msg1044067#msg1044067">Quote from: GayMuslim on April 23, 2013, 04:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I killed Americans.

Enjoy your negs. This thread has been created by Princess to help you new newbies. If you waste her time with stupid comments like this and questions on how big her rack is then not only will you be negged but you will find yourself isolated in future from having your slightly more pertinent questions answered by her, as Silk Road and its forums is too big not to have the option of placing someone on Iggy and going off to help other members who are more deserving, or have a higher brain cell count.<br /><br />My advice to people on this thread is that Princess is a long-standing vet with experience on Silk Road that goes well beyond her Join Date, which very few vendors here can compete with. There are a lot of vendors here who are still learning the ropes and who simply cannot answer drug use and tech questions to the standard that Princess can, and if you waste her time then it will only mean that she will be less inclined to help when you really need her.<br /><br />Also, I would like to know anyone on Silk Road who could actually compete with her level of knowledge and expertise, let alone be prepared to make themselves available to patiently answer questions on a frequent basis. This includes mods and admin who, from experience, are not always &quot;there&quot; to help with new members&#039; many questions to the degree their job description would have you believe. If Princess cannot get back to you with an answer on a SENSIBLE question, then good luck finding out elsewhere.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Urm did you see who left the &quot;how big your rack&quot; comment ? Limetless has been around this site longer than all of us put together and he&#039;s one of the top vendors on this site. he probably knows PH very well, I&#039;m assuming it was an inside joke..<br />lol </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Razorspyne is right and thank-you for your delightful input, you know how to make&nbsp; &nbsp;me smile! Whilst I thoroughly enjoy a jolly good banter and a joke I would like to reserve this thread for helping newbies or any member of our community who requests it, as per the subject of this thread suggests &#039;sensibly&#039;. There are a few other threads that have recently caught my eye&nbsp; notably White 0ut&#039;s &#039;*UPDATED* 04/26/13 -White 0ut&#039;s-*Official* &quot;Guide/Links/Tutorials&quot;Newbs Welcome!&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140099.0 and pine&#039;s &#039;Pine - AMA&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147979.0 It&#039;s threads like these and I hope this one too that can help us to evolve, prosper, and thrive as a community, through helping and looking out for one another we can move forward for the better good, if I can be part of this process through this thread and through other contributions on the forum it&#039;s something that humbles me and makes me feel very happy inside. Now, let&#039;s get this thread back on track and move on with sharing the sensible questions, knowledge, and insight :) <br />Thank-you everybody for your questions and contributions, please keep them rolling in!

The &#039;Resolution Center&#039;s&#039; decision is final and irreversible. What I&#039;ve mentioned is the various outcomes I&#039;ve seen depending on the circumstance and is unofficial, ultimately if you and the vendor cannot reach an agreement the &#039;Resolution Center&#039; will decide for both of you. If you wish to build up a case in your favour I&#039;d suggest you search the forum to see if other members have not been receiving their orders and for any feedback on the vendor&#039;s page pertaining to non-arrivals, I wish you all the best reaching a satisfactory resolution :)

				Hi Princess,<br /><br />I must repeat how good it is to have this thread and be able to browse through it and gain so much information.<br />Definitely a newie here and have kicked of a vendor account app six days ago.<br /><br />What amazes me already is the amount of people who will try to obtain free samples when you have already declared up front that you will not do it. I asked some forum members (10) to accept free samples to have them give an honest opinion to find of the ten that took up the offer four came back and ordered but did not put up a review even after getting the freebie. Would it be considered unfair to not take the orders from them.?<br /><br />The others who took samples happily wrote terrific reviews and ordered more.<br /><br />Being all new to the road is it unreasonable for a vendor to not take an order and not provide any reason to the buyer?<br />Or , should I tell the potential buyer why the order was canceled.<br /><br />I suppose the real question is, Can a vendor dictate to who he will sell and to those he wont or should it be open slather.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those who are not prepared to undertake or comply with listing requirements and do what is asked of them re communicating and hassling over shipping times and filling the in box with inane and useless questions should just get no answer when they try to order again??. If I say to a buyer that he did not do what was asked of him and refuse to sell any further product and he in turn starts slinging negative crap on the forums or feedback do I have any recourse that can let me amend feedback that is unjustified.<br />Have had one already try to blackmail with negative reports simply because I have told him that I will no longer sell to him because he would not comply with my profile requests re ordering and messaging. Three messages a day &quot;my order is not here where is it&quot;.. if he starts negging me what can I do?<br /><br />Thanks for your stella efforts with this forum<br /><br />NN<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Howdy. I have what I&#039;m assuming is a really specific question and probably hasn&#039;t been answered. Let&#039;s say I have a shitty part time job but 100-200k in dirty money, cash. Let&#039;s also say I want to move the money around so that it appears in my hand with the purpose of legitimate investment. The catch is that I don&#039;t want the initial amount to be taxable by revenue(they&#039;d want to know where I got it and fuck taxes because they&#039;re a scam) From the research I&#039;ve done the best option would be finding a shady accountant to set up a tax haven account. Then all I&#039;d have to do is make deposits. However that&#039;s risky for something I could do myself with the proper knowledge. Are there better ways to bring the money into the open without generating an audit? Is an accountant who knows to keep quiet a good idea? Also I don&#039;t want to launder through a business if it can be helped. I figure eventually I&#039;ll have the connections to make it happen but again I&#039;d rather do it myself or at least have the knowledge.

I asked some forum members (10) to accept free samples to have them give an honest opinion to find of the ten that took up the offer four came back and ordered but did not put up a review even after getting the freebie. Would it be considered unfair to not take the orders from them.?<br /><br />The others who took samples happily wrote terrific reviews and ordered more.<br /><br />Being all new to the road is it unreasonable for a vendor to not take an order and not provide any reason to the buyer?<br />Or , should I tell the potential buyer why the order was canceled.<br /><br />I suppose the real question is, Can a vendor dictate to who he will sell and to those he wont or should it be open slather.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those who are not prepared to undertake or comply with listing requirements and do what is asked of them re communicating and hassling over shipping times and filling the in box with inane and useless questions should just get no answer when they try to order again??. If I say to a buyer that he did not do what was asked of him and refuse to sell any further product and he in turn starts slinging negative crap on the forums or feedback do I have any recourse that can let me amend feedback that is unjustified.<br />Have had one already try to blackmail with negative reports simply because I have told him that I will no longer sell to him because he would not comply with my profile requests re ordering and messaging. Three messages a day &quot;my order is not here where is it&quot;.. if he starts negging me what can I do?<br /><br />Thanks for your stella efforts with this forum<br /><br />NN </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Hello nodnow, thank-you for your kind words they&#039;re much appreciated, I will try my best to help you. It&#039;s common practice for members to request samples from new vendors, however it is your business and it&#039;s your choice how you run it. If you are going down the route of &#039;self selecting&#039; members for samples, you approaching members rather you starting a thread in the &#039;Product offers&#039; section and letting them approach you, check their forum reputation and marketplace purchasing stats are sound, check they&#039;ve got experience in the product/s you wish them to sample, and I&#039;d recommend you check this thread &#039;Ballz&#039;n&#039;Blargh&#039;s Reliable Reviewers&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=117957.0 the reviewers there were initially vetted by a very trustworthy forum member BlarghRawr who is sadly no longer with us, since then the reigns have been passed to another respected member Ballzinator, while it is not endorsed officially by SilkRoad, in my opinion it&#039;s the closest initiative we&#039;ll ever have to a honest and quality reviewer list, in my honest opinion you can&#039;t go far wrong by selecting reviewers from there then selecting some reviewers that are unlisted as not every good reviewer wanted to be apart of it (and some might be unaware of it), some reviewers prefer to hide in the shadows. The key to finding good reviewers is doing your research, make the effort, and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Yes, again, as your vendors account is your business you have every right who you refuse business to, you can specify this on your vendor&#039;s page by saying &#039;I reserve the right of who I do business with&#039;, by stating a set amount of purchases (five or ten are quite common), and by stating a set % &#039;Refund rate&#039; and &#039;Auto-finiaze rate&#039;, if your customer places an order and doesn&#039;t meet the specified requirements you have every right of refusal. If you believe the customer is genuine but hasn&#039;t made the effort to read your requirements ask your customer to, if they&#039;re genuine, understanding, and want their order they&#039;ll be happy to comply. If you find a customer spreading unfounded falsehood on the forum you should defend yourself. As far as I&#039;m aware you cannot appeal for feedback to be corrected, however you can explain why on your vendor&#039;s page and relevant listing your defence for the feedback.<br /><br />If a customer is repeatedly abusive or forceful my best advice is to inform the customer you&#039;re no longer doing business with them, then ignore them, delete all messages and orders pertaining to the customer without giving any further reason as it is unnecessary, your customer may be persistent at first, however your customer will give up eventually and seek business elsewhere, take mental note of your customers username to safeguard yourself in the future. As you&#039;re a new vendor you won&#039;t meet the criteria yet&nbsp; however as soon as you do I highly recommend you apply for membership of the vendor&#039;s forum &#039;The Roundtable&#039; you&#039;ll find the criteria on the SilkRoad wiki dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Vendor_roundtable &#039;The Roundtable&#039; has a blacklist where vendors can warn others of customers to steer clear of.

I have what I&#039;m assuming is a really specific question and probably hasn&#039;t been answered. Let&#039;s say I have a shitty part time job but 100-200k in dirty money, cash. Let&#039;s also say I want to move the money around so that it appears in my hand with the purpose of legitimate investment. The catch is that I don&#039;t want the initial amount to be taxable by revenue(they&#039;d want to know where I got it and fuck taxes because they&#039;re a scam) From the research I&#039;ve done the best option would be finding a shady accountant to set up a tax haven account. Then all I&#039;d have to do is make deposits. However that&#039;s risky for something I could do myself with the proper knowledge. Are there better ways to bring the money into the open without generating an audit? Is an accountant who knows to keep quiet a good idea? Also I don&#039;t want to launder through a business if it can be helped. I figure eventually I&#039;ll have the connections to make it happen but again I&#039;d rather do it myself or at least have the knowledge. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Money laundering techniques, understandably, aren&#039;t discussed in great depth on the forum, if you do a search on the forum homepage typing in &#039;money laundering&#039; you&#039;ll find a number of threads relating to the subject, if you do a search on the marketplace you&#039;ll find some experienced vendor&#039;s who offer consultations in exchange for a fee.

				I don&#039;t get that. If you have a unique method of laundering you&#039;d know it is and not tell anyone. If you don&#039;t have a unique method what&#039;s the harm in spreading it around to help other people? Is it a matter of wanting to profit from it? I could understand that. Not sure anyone is selling info on tax havens. I could PM vendors and ask if they could offer it though. Anyway, thanks for the response Princess.

I suggest, to safeguard yourself prior to ordering a larger amount to order a few smaller amounts from the vendor to see if you&#039;re satisfied with the stealth and product quality prior to placing a larger order, it&#039;s always better to test the waters to see what you&#039;re dealing with than taking an unnecessary risk, if you believe a vendor&#039;s stealth to be below par, inform the vendor and direct to this thread &#039;STEALTH THAT WORKS - DITCH THE PE FOOD GRADE VAC SEAL&#039; <br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0 It also works in your favour to have multiple addresses to send to, in the instance one address gets burned you always have a backup to turn to, and not to place too many large orders to the same address together, distributing the risk is far better than putting all your eggs in one basket.

You are correct. Don&#039;t finalize until you get what you expect. If there is a problem, dispute resolution is available. If you release the funds prior, your chances at a resolution diminish. <br />2. LE= Law Enforcement. LEO= Law Enforcement Organization (DEA, FBI, ETC)<br />3. As far as postal boxes are concerned don&#039;t use one from USPS. Try to get one from a private company that provides after hours access. Don&#039;t necessarily have to switch them up but, open the account using a dummy name.<br />4. Tor is already setup and ready to go. However, you should use a secure platform Windows is not secure. Get a thumb drive and install Tails.&nbsp; &nbsp;(tails.boum.org)

				As a new vendor, should i go with pre or post commission pricing?

				Sorry, one last one that has been troubling me, already i have recieved a couple of orders with encrypted email, but they have not included thier PUBLIC KEY. I have searched these forums, and they have not posted it here. WHen i click on their name on SR it takes me to message, not a profile. Is there somewhere else i should be looking, or have they just forgot to send it to me. I am assuming of course that their profile name is the same as their forum name.

				@AustralianHash&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and give you some short answer to your questions, I hope it helps.&nbsp; As far as &#039;post commision&#039; pricing and express post?&nbsp; I say a BIG fuckin YES to those 2 babies!<br /><br />As long as the orders value covers the cost of express post, (which is what 5 bucks an envelope?) then that&#039;s cool, maybe you should give the &#039;normal&#039; option for those folks in not so much hurry?<br />That way you save yourself money when it&#039;s not needed to spend it.&nbsp; Also, only as it matters for delivery times, the &quot;Express Post&quot; around here is delivered in parts by the posties and part by contractors for AusPost so they come at different times!&nbsp; It&#039;s so random it&#039;s weird!<br /><br />OK next, with the problem of the city. hey put another city for all they care, and probably safer for you, shit mix it up a bit, they&#039;re no rules to this gig bro!&nbsp; Seriously I dont think it matters unless you are putting a valid return addy on your packs (woot!?)&nbsp; which I doubt, so dont sweat it unless you think you&#039;re under scrutiny...if so, you should really GTFO before ??? who knows?<br /><br />Next, the only thing that REALLY needs to be encrypted, are delivery drop names and addresses.&nbsp; We include any &#039;sensitive&#039; information including certain business communications in the address box WITH the addy so the vendor reads it when they open the message .... the only reason you need their ,key is iF they want you to send them an encrypted message and if they do they can send you their key before somewhere..even here as a pm.<br /><br />&nbsp;The whole of the SR is encrypted to a degree together with Tor provides a few layers of security but sure it&#039;s always best to encrypt any sensitive data you&nbsp; wish to transmit, and once you have sent it, you delete it&#039;s ass and away you go.&nbsp; After all do you REALLY want 100 custys publuc keys cluttering up your keyring?&nbsp; They&#039;re not facebook &#039;friends&#039; bro!<br /><br />Anyhoo we wish&nbsp; you well in your endeavours upon The Road hashman, you take care there bro ok?<br /><br />much love internet friend<br /><br />m m m motek x <br /><br /><br />

				What is the best way to sell bitcoins anyonymously? Now with the new anti-moundering laws it&#039;s becoming increasingly difficult to do without raising red flags. I have a couple of ideas but they don&#039;t seem feasible.

Vendors are usually not as often on the forums as they are on the main site! And you won&#039;t get blacklisted for messaging a vendor, messaging a vendor is no big deal and is often a way to see if he&#039;s worth doing business with or not especially if it&#039;s a new vendor. You just shouldn&#039;t harass vendors with messages asking them where your package is and other things like that and try not to PM the big vendors too much because they have a lot of messages to answer everyday. Just stay friendly and also don&#039;t ask them to explain you how to get bitcoins or how to use PGP :P
