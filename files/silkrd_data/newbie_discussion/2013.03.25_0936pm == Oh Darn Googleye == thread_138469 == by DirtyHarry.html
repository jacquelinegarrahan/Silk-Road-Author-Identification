				Sure.<br /><br />I shipped for Googleye. he stabbed me in the back. I have his clientele and tracking and more...<br /><br />So why am I here? why is it just not posted in another forum and bumped up?<br /><br />Simple: if you have a purchase you have a right to know.

				I understand your frustration man, and that sucks he screwed you over. But why bring innocent customers into it? Shred that info man, shitttt. I mean come on, it even states in the rules to always discard customer info. I&#039;ve ordered from GE and although it took like 2 weeks to receive, it came and was of decent quality. I feel as though you have a personal vendetta against him/her and came to the forums to express your anger. If GE was as bad as you make him out to be he wouldn&#039;t be a top SR vendor with a 90%+ rating. We would have heard a long time ago if GE was fucking us over. <br /><br />I feel for you man, it always sucks getting ripped off but you have to charge that shit to the game bro. We all know the consequences, and if you&#039;re working with a vendor you should know even better. Shred the customer info man, thats not cool at all that you have a shit ton of SR customers info. Not cool at allll.<br /><br />Hope things get worked out between GE and yourself. Handle this like a man. Don&#039;t bring innocent folks down with you.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />PB

				<br /><br />Ratt and snitch is apart from heroin addicted sloppy business man. <br /><br />In May of 2012 Perry Mosdromos a friend and an ex-remailer was investigated and subsequently arrested. <br />http://www.almanacnews.com/news/show_story.php?id=11398 <br /><br />He called me. He begged for help. He was lost and confused. I will never forgive myself for laughing at him when he said,<br />&quot;I didn&#039;t order dick from UK, I don&#039;t miss with that Xanax crap.&quot; I foolishly asked, &quot;Magical Xanax Perry?&quot; He broke down, <br />&quot;Frank you idiot you are to stubborn to see anything past your tunnel vision, Xanax aint steroids or vicodin, help me don&#039;t<br />leave me hanging.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Richard had and has&nbsp; a habit to infiltrate and compromise because he is what he is. In the attached Federal Investigation 13th pharagraph<br />Perry denies knowning how this package of xanax came to be. Apart, he does not know why new article cited UK security forces were involved or why they started such investigation. However, paragraph 14 he admits to manufacturing. <br /><br /><br />1. Xanax from UK had a tracking, it was sent from where Richard other remailer sends this tracking is not disclosed but held back in the F.I. <br />2. manufacturing Perry admits to but UK security forces and Xanax he knows nothing about.<br />3.

				The Problem here is that the average newby or even experienced buyer comes here and thing that every person is a name and an account.<br /><br />That is not true. Googleye and the Snitch Ratt express have many sub seller accounts. <br /><br />So this is not an issue in which you meet Richard and he is just one seller, Richard is many people.&nbsp; Richard associates with many. For many months <br />we sat and we watched the Snitching Ratt Express. <br /><br />Folks I am not going to overload a thread. Many may think perhaps the Investigation documentation is to hard and expensive and it is. If you like confirm the documentation is not fake. You are all welcome to check every document prior to rambling posts and threads with no point.<br /><br />In total I refuse to loose the meaning of these discussion boards and safety of my men. I sacrificed and put up with a two bit snitch to bring to you <br />the alpha to the omega. I am sure are in panic that Richard is sending 4734.5 Onax to your homes and not safeguarding your safety. However, this is meaningless without everything that is Richard destroyed and all that sleep with the snitch-en ratt to follow behind him. <br /><br />On private boards discussion has been heated, and many have turned, and most are scared as they should be, because he did to Perry what he thinks is funny PMSing moments. {------- Not Joking. Defined purpose is not to see another end up like Perry. My task has been simple. You are to judge. Those who have turned against already slow down and allow the masses to take a look at a boy trying to be a man. Fellas allow a few days to a it all to come to light.<br /><br /><br />I thank you all and allow time for people to check and confirm details as it is much to understand.

				So whats with googleye&#039;s new policy of waiting up to 4 days to deposit Bitcoin, after payment is received for coin. It seems to me that he is skimming off of everyone&#039;s coin. <br />&nbsp;He sits on your coin and waits for the value of the coin to rise, then when the value of the coin starts to fall then he pays you coin, but only in the dollar amount that you gave him to begin with.<br />&nbsp;After you buy coins from him, his gives the coins at the going rate at he time of delivery, not the going rate at the time of purchase. Googleye is intentionally skimming bitcoins, and using the excuse that &quot;due to a scammer&quot; he has to delay the delivery of the coins. How do you scam someone with Western Union Googleye? I mean other than accepting payment, then not transfering coin until the value goes up, then you get to keep a good share of the coin that was bought, Right? Right now that system of doing things is very profitable, he doesn&#039;t need to invest his own money into bitcoin to make money off of the rapidly rising bitcoin value.

				Actually this story has become believable, after reading the .pdf. Perry claims he was part of a larger operation, and he was found with lots of address labels for international orders printed out, as well as lots of methylone (which he claimed was &quot;MDMA&quot; when asked by the DEA agents what it was, haha.)

				Of course they should be known, in fact, if it was up to me, I&#039;d make the homepage of SR a dedicated blacklist. There is no reason a scammer should be allowed to continue to vend, even if he turns legit. Once a scam always a scam, it&#039;s just going to take another perfect opportunity for them to abuse it again.

This is a very sad state of affairs considering the help and generosity we showed you. <br /><br />People of SR, <br /><br />I am extremely surprised to see this post, in fact I&#039;m completely shocked. I feel due to the severity of these accusations i should make some very clear statements on behalf of Googleyed as a whole.<br /><br />1) We do not save our customer&#039;s shipping information, it is deleted as soon as the order has been dispatched.<br />2) Who the hell is Perry??!! I have never heard this person, let alone be somehow involved in his death&nbsp; :o<br />3) Frank has just fatally contradicted himself by posting information he should not have had in the first place...correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but does that not make him the rat?! (i did not personally see any of this info and would be surprised if it was even legit)<br />4) I am bemused by franks accusations that he has been ripped off by us considering he still owes us $7,000 <br />5) This is no way to resolve any dispute, and i think any rational human being will be able to see through this attempt to slander our organization. An emotional response to a business decision is never wise, he was terrible at his job: we fired him.&nbsp; <br />6) Frank did in fact ship for us for a short period of time and was discontinued due to strange behavior and incompetence. This included bizarre messages about aliens and the DEA. <br />7) No private customer information has EVER been shared. We take our reputation very seriously and have strict operating procedures when it comes to customer privacy.<br />8) We as an organization consist of two parts: Googleyed/GoogleyedXL. We do not have any other directly associated vendor accounts run by our team.<br />9) None of the correspondence Frank has posted is real. Who would use MSN to talk business anyway??! <br /><br />It is business as usual at Googleyed. By all means feel free to ask us any questions you may have, we will do our best to put to rest any concerns that have risen due to this post. <br /><br />Googleyed/GoogleyedXL<br />

				It is a possibility that he saved some addresses, yes. But this is not something we are aware of or had any knowledge of at the time. The rules are clear, once the order has been dispatched, the address is deleted and no records are kept.

				Right, but the issue is that he was shipping for you and kept records of buyers&#039; names and addresses and has posted them multiple times all over the forums in the last 24-48 hours.&nbsp; Now he has posted them on other forums as well which are out of our control.

				I wish the links to the outside pages could be removed as I&#039;m just not happy about the fact that these people have had their names and addresses splashed everywhere.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking about the implications of this since he started to disclose.&nbsp; There was something like 30+ peoples details that now anyone can get their hands on, either to stalk, blackmail, harass or hand of to LE.&nbsp; These people may have spouses and kids who are now put at risk because of the internet crazies or people who have a nasty frame of mind.

				There is no evidence to suggest they are legitimate. I am not trying to play down the severity of this matter but perhaps inflaming it will only create a larger problem. Googleyed takes full responsibility for any incursions of SR rules and we would prefer to settle any further issues there may be in private with SR staff.

				This is a a vendors worst nightmare, being a vendor myself you follow the rules of the forum to protect your customers and your own safety. The guy posting peoples addresses(not googleeyd) is the worst type of person who has total disregard of anyone else life and is a totally selfish individual that is using this as a way of crying out for attention as he feels like he needs to serve some sort of purpose to his worthless existence, i truly hate people who for their own selfish causes compromises others safety, you sir are a true snitch rat for posting innocent peoples addresses, they never hurt you, they never back stabbed you, if you have a problem with GE keep it out the fucking public eye! this does not effect Googleeyd business in the slightest if your plan is to sabotage, his feedback speaks for itself hes doing a good job all your doing is hurting innocent people, its already too late I bet your one of those guys that knows hes a piece of shit, looks at himself in the mirror and smiles at the piece of shit looking back. <br /><br />Please dont look at googleyed as a villan here, i&#039;m speaking from a vendors prospective, we all do as we&#039;re told and we delete your addresses and are fully aware that this is highly important, but once we pass to our re-shippers we stress the importance of deleting sensitive data this to them but we can&#039;t babysit them and have someone watching over them 24/7 to make sure they delete their addresses, so please understand that we will continue to bring you a service we continue to put our necks out on the line for you and we will continue to work together closely we our clients, vendors need your support during these kinds of horrible freak situations, not to panic, not to be rash and point fingers, take a&nbsp; good look at this situation here, googleeyed is making good money he has absolutely no reason to backstab or rip anyone off, this guy is simply outraged not to mention delusional at the fact that googleed didn&#039;t want to work with his futher, and quite fucking rightly so too, hes a nutcase.&nbsp; &nbsp;Admins, i would advice deleting this whole entire thread completely.<br /><br />Googleeyd: If you have any info on this guy please let me know for a fee i could send some heavys to go take care of him and take away his laptop to prevent further damage. <br /><br />Kind Regards<br />SunWu

				Please never use dox dropping as a method of revenge... because no matter how badly you hate someone... it helps the tyrants that destroy lives by locking someone away to be subjected to sexual assault for years and an opioid addict being beaten as he is WDing without methadone (WHO considers this torture -- to deny opi addicts methadone in prison) USA and Islamic countries are the only ones who deny a prisoner who has been put on maintenance therapy their medicine to punish them, a prison warden nullifies the prescription of a DOCTOR, this is also done with people PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT on benzos.. and they die.. This happens to nonviolent drug offenders. In the land of the free. <br /><br />Fuck the police.

				I have just deleted the forum account in the name of &#039;none&#039; as they just posted another list of buyers details in this thread. I am sure this will only slow them up as long as it takes to register a new account though so please if you see this miscreant show up under another account name posting identifiable information please hit the report to moderator button immediately. We shall see who gets bored first, I can keep erasing this idiot all day long.<br /><br />
