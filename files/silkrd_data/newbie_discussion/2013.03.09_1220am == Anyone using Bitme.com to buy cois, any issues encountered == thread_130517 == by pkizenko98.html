Unfortunately their volume is relatively low, so it may take a while to buy coins if you can&#039;t transfer your money to somewhere else. <br /><br />However in the past week or two their have been reports of no response from support and currently it seems marked deposits are broken.

				I can confirm; marked depsits are not working and there is no response from customer support. <br /><br />I think it looks like bitfloor.com is the best alternative now.

I also sent support an e-mail and have yet to hear from them. It seems as if coin orders are being filled on a daily basis. bitcopia seems like a decent alternative and supports Wells Fargo banks. I wish they would stop avoiding all the questions and let us know whats going on!

				Since I made this post I have had 2 great transactions with them, but my last one is being held up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I sent a couple emails back, slowly, but from what I&#039;m hearing here, customer service completely lied to me! It&#039;s too bad, they were solid before this!
