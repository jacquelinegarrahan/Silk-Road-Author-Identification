				I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;ve found out so far, and if I&#039;m all wrong, some Sr. Member is going to correct me.<br /><br />One of the easiest places to buy if you&#039;re in the UK (like me) is https://localbitcoins.com/buy_bitcoins , registration and using the site is as simple as it can be.<br /><br />You can go for the cash options which are usually cheaper than buying online. I did not fool around, simply ordered the coins via National bank transfer, just had to make a transfer to e.g. a Barclays account, then 5 minutes later I got my coins.<br /><br />Then you transfer out of your localbitcoins wallet, e.g. to blockchain.info . From there, you should transfer them to Bitcoinfog ( http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ ) to anonymize your coins, they charge a 1%-3% fee when you deposit (withdrawing is free).<br /><br />And from Bitcoinfog, you can finally transfer to SR. If you&#039;re really paranoid, you can divide the transaction into multiple parts and use multiple SR wallets for each, and of course use more than the initial 6 hours of timespan.<br /><br />So yes, while buying bitcoins via bank transfer leaves a paper trail, it&#039;s absolutely legal and once it goes through the fog, you are good to go.

				pgp is definitely a necessity for selling on here as some buyers will only feel comfortable communicating with encryption

				How necessary is it to &quot;wash&quot; your coins through Bitcoinfog? Is it safe to simply transfer them straight into your SR account?<br /><br />Thanks

				I guess you can do that, especially if you bought your coins anonymously.<br /><br />But an extra level of security never hurts, I think it worths the 3%. Why risk your freedom?
