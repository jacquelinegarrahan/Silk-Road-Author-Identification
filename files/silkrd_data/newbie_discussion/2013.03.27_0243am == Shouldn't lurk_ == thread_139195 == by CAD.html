				Because I&#039;ve been lurking and not posting, for the past year or so, I can&#039;t start new topic or comment on things that are important to me. Why? Anyway, I want the vendors to lift their game and use barrier membrane bags with foil, evoh or both. DPR needs to make this one of the guidelines. I also want them to use express. The less time our drugs are in the post, the less odour will permeate through.

				Thanks for the advice ladyjane, but here&#039;s the thing. Everyone harps on about using the search function, which I&#039;ve been doing for the past year or more as a &#039;guest&#039;. I&#039;ve been reading other threads, and the moment I have a question I want to ask, that I can&#039;t find in the forum by using the search function or make suggestions that haven&#039;t been suggested, I have to have 50 posts? I&#039;m no newbie.

				Because spammers and idiots that post rubbish have ruined it for all.<br /><br />This is a way to try and reduce it.<br /><br />Payed forum accounts would be better though.

				I have been slow to reach 50 because I didn&#039;t realise I had to in order to post outside of here. It makes sense even if it is annoying. <br /><br />As for vendors stepping up their stealth standards, maybe a polite nod to this thread could be of use http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0

				I keep reading complaints regarding the SR forum&#039;s search facility.<br /><br />I&#039;ve not had an problems with it and have so far always found the info I was looking for.<br /><br />Spamming for 50 is not cool but kudos for lurking for so long.

				I doubt this will happen.<br />Vendors set the rules because they have what you want - Drugs. There are plenty of buyers on here and if the buyers don&#039;t like the rules, someone else will buy the drugs anyway. Vendors have no shortage of orders and most won&#039;t go out of their way to improve packaging if most ordersare arriving fine.

				I&#039;ve been slow at attaining my 50 posts as well,<br />But I don&#039;t copy+paste the same post over and over again like this.<br />This will probably get you banned.
