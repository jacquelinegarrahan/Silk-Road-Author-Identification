				Newb here so I cannot post anywhere else.&nbsp; I have a few fentanyl blotters that are supposed to be 200 mcg a piece. The problem is that the bio-availability of fentanyl taken orally is ridiculously low.&nbsp; Really it is a waste of fentanyl. In fact for me to feel good with them I need to take upwards of 6. I have 5 or 6 left. What about cutting each blotter up into tiny pieces of paper and then putting that in a small amount of water and plugging?&nbsp; Does anyone know the bio-availability of doing something like this?&nbsp; If anyone here knows a fent expert then can you pass this question on to them?&nbsp; I would think that 200mcg intranasally would be pretty strong so I figure maybe it would be somewhere in between.<br />Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks!

				Honestly, man, just shoot it. I&#039;m probably the only person who will ever give this as &#039;advice&#039;, but so long as you are doing it properly and not cutting corners, IV is just as safe as eating the shit. Fentanyl is just like dilaudid in this respect, you have to shoot it to really get your money&#039;s worth.<br /><br />We do this in hospitals all over the world millions of times every day, all your arguments against it&#039;s safety are invalid.<br /><br />Anyway, I have the advantage of actual medical training, but do you know how we practiced putting in IV&#039;s or giving IV shots? On each other, or ourselves, with saline solution. All the time.<br /><br />Proper procedures are easy to find online so I won&#039;t bore you with the details. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable doing it, odds are you know someone who is capable of doing it for you. It doesn&#039;t hurt, and nothing else compares. That&#039;s the only real &#039;danger&#039;, honestly, once you use a needle it&#039;s the only way you want to do stuff, but if you&#039;re safe, it&#039;s not a big deal. If you ask I bet most of the people who would warn you off of the idea are people who have never done it.<br /><br />Dosing IV fentanyl is kind of iffy, make sure you know the concentration of your solution and err on the low side to be safe.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

				I love IVing it, but it seems to fuck with your tolly quicker than other ROA&#039;s. It&#039;s great if you&#039;re just doing it every once in awhile, but when I was getting Fent regularly I IVed and smoked it. Seriously, smoking it on foil is the way to go. I&#039;ve watched someone go from stone cold sober to about to nod out of their chair in about 60 seconds just from one hit. Check out Opiophile&#039;s many threads on smoking Fent for more info. There&#039;s a step by step guide there somewhere.
