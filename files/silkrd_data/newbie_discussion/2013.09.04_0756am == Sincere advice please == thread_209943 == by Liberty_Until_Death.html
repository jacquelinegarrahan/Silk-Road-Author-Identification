				I am using Onion Browser.&nbsp; Strictly for browsing.&nbsp; I would never purchase from my phone I&#039;m not <br />A moron.&nbsp; <br /><br />But seriously. I would never want to jeopardize the community by putting them at risk for not having proper security.&nbsp; Do you guys think I should stop logging in until I get a computer?<br />

				The operating systems of mobile devices are extremely untrustworthy. You&#039;re not jeopardizing the community, you&#039;re jeopardizing yourself. <br /><br />It is best advised that you wait until you get a computer to log in again. Even then, make sure to use TAILS on a thumb drive.

				There are alternative ways to safely browse SR other than with the last poster said.&nbsp; While tails is a good solution, the tor browser bundle is still OK to use if you disable all the scripts and javascript.&nbsp; I highly recommend investing in a VPN which will provide the added layer of security so your ISP can&#039;t see exactly what you&#039;re up to in the event you are being investigated.&nbsp; Also always use PGP when placing an order (never send your name or address unencrypted).&nbsp; And finally run random DBAN&#039;s on your computer if possible (keep a different computer just for SR or don&#039;t keep much on your drive so when you DBAN you&#039;re not losing all your important files, pictures and programs.)&nbsp; Tumble your bitcoins by passing them through at minimum 1 wallet before depositing them to SR and perhaps using bitcoin fog which works the best.&nbsp; <br /><br />That should set you up for decent security on the computer side of things.

				Apparently the general consensus these days is that Tails is not the bastion of security it&#039;s reputation would have you believe: it has a somewhat significant flaw in the way it handles Tor by default which puts you at increased risk for identification using the most well known attacks on Tor users.<br />... that&#039;s about as specific as I can be without going into the way Tor and Tails work, but that sounds so inaccurate now that I&#039;ve said it -- it&#039;s just that Tails doesn&#039;t have any persistent data storage by default, so you get a new entry guard every time you boot.&nbsp; That&#039;s a bad thing, and is all I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />Also, I completely agree with soviet: you probably do not want to log in at all -- not to your real account anyway.&nbsp; Just make a new one and browse using that &quot;fake&quot; one.
