				Hi all,<br /><br />Does anyone know how express mail is usually delivered? I live in an small apartment with an outdoor mailbox bank, and I&#039;m really hoping that express mail will just be left in the box, rather than having the carrier knock on my door or anything. Anyone have any experience in this regard - it would be much appreciated!

				Are you referring to domestic or international? Either way, it depends on what you ordered, how it&#039;s packaged, and whether or not they require you to sign for it. Don&#039;t freak out if you get a little note from the P.O. asking you to come get it. <br /><br />-Judge

				yes, it depends on where you are and where its coming from.<br /><br />I will assume you are in the US.<br /><br />Normal US express mail should arrive without the need for a signature.&nbsp; As long as it can fit in your apartment mailbox they will leave it there.&nbsp; If it won&#039;t fit, they may leave a card saying you need to pick it up from the post office.<br /><br />If the express mail order is coming from outside the US you will probably have to sign for it.&nbsp; I know that express mail between Canada and the US requires a signature.&nbsp; Which means they will leave a card asking you to come to the post office to sign for the order.<br /><br />One thing to make sure of on domestic US-US express mail orders is to be sure the vendor does not check the &#039;requires signature&#039; box.&nbsp; Some types of domestic express mail have an option that allows the sender to ask for a signature, so if in doubt PM the vendor before the order is sent making sure that they don&#039;t check that box by accident.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s all good bro, postal systems are far too bloated to run checks, your packages would/will be sweet.

				you will be fine....but dont be surprised if it comes at a different time than your regular mail, i have read many threads all over the place about this and some get it with their regular mail and others get their delivered separately, mine gets delivered separately and they do the same as the normal mail so i just wanted to relay that to you cause the day i was suppose to have things express, the mail already came for the day but 3-4hrs later another guy dropped it off just like a normal delivery and left.

I know that post offices receive mail multiple times per day (usually around 6am and then again around noon). The nature of express mail is just that...EXPRESS.&nbsp; If your postman is lazy then he will just bring it with your regular mail but he should be close by to deliver it shortly after it arrives at the PO. Some people send express with a &#039;guaranteed by x:xx pm&#039;. As stated earlier, just kindly contact your vendor to get details<br /><br />-Judge<br /><br />

				Hey all. So the mailman got into my building somehow and came to my door. Freaked me out at first (already anxious to get what was coming), but he was just hand delivering it, no signature (which is good, because refusing to sign would have been awkward by that point).<br /><br />This is the second time I&#039;ve had mail brought to my door by USPS - which, in general, I appreciate - so for those of you who live in apartments with letter banks, bear this in mind (at least with USPS domestic express).

				I&#039;ve had no luck with express orders. Vendors let them sit in processing for four days, defeating the whole purpose of express. One time had a QP delivered express and the vendor sent four packages AND I had to sign! Never again. Too much stress.
