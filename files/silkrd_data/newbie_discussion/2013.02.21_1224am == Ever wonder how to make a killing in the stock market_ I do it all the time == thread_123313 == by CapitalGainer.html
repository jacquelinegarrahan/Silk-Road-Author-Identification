				Hey guys.&nbsp; I&#039;m new here obviously.&nbsp; Let me get straight to the point though.&nbsp; I have an acquaintance who works in the mergers and acquisitions dept. and one of the most prominent investment banks.&nbsp; Every two or three weeks or so he gives me information on upcoming mergers, acquisitions, and financing&#039;s for publicly traded companies.&nbsp; I use this info to make 10, 20, or even 30 or 40 percent on&nbsp; a single trade.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve just been using funds from myself and my acquaintance to make these trades using an offshore broker.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for a way to increase the size of my trades for the obviously larger return on investment (not such an easy thing to do when using an illegal trading strategy).&nbsp; My research into this has lead me to the world of Tor and Bitcoins.&nbsp; I think if I could get a &quot;bitcoin hedge fund&quot; going we could see some very nice returns.&nbsp; I could convert invested Bitcoins into cash to leverage my trades and then cash out and convert back to bitcoins.&nbsp; I could take a percentage of the winnings as my fee.&nbsp; I see it as a way to make myself wealthier as well as anyone who would like to invest.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I&#039;m basically looking for input if you guys think this is viable (anonymity issues?) and if there would be any interest in this venture.<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				Honestly I think you should stop.... not because it is illegal, but because eventually you are probably going to get caught and say, &quot;Was it worth it?&quot;<br /><br />But I think that investing in (or whatever your doing) with Bitcoins would be a pretty profitable idea. My view on it is that Bitcoins are only going to grow as technology grows; and technology certainly is growing ;)

				Thanks for the reply ANocioni5!<br /><br />Honestly, if anyone&#039;s paranoid about getting caught, it&#039;s me.&nbsp; I go to some pretty far lengths to make sure my name isn&#039;t tied to any of it.&nbsp; I use several offshore brokers using aliases.&nbsp; These brokers are also known for blocking the SEC from doing any snooping.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the hardest part about the operation is the laundering which I&#039;m not going to get into.<br /><br />And I agree Bitcoins are certainly a promising and interesting currency!

				So yeah, all anyone needs to do is invest with you as a middleman so they can cash on these logic defying returns huh?<br /><br />TBH, you&#039;re kind of late to the game.

				They would be logic defying returns if I was trading with no information like most people, but I am not.&nbsp; Just go to Finviz.com or Yahoo Finance and look at the list of the top gainers and losers for the day.&nbsp; These are the kind of stocks I trade.&nbsp; These are the stocks being influenced by financing deals, acquisitions, and mergers.&nbsp; And yes I even make money on the huge declines in stock prices.&nbsp; I simply short the stock.&nbsp; My biggest winner so far this year was when I shorted CLSN at $8. Then next morning it was trading at $1.40. Easiest 80% percent of my life.

				I appreciate the feedback guys and I understand the skepticism.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d like to clarify some things. At this time I am not soliciting any of you for any money; I&#039;m was just hoping to see what your thoughts were about the viability of a bitcoin fund and if there is even anyone out there looking to invest using bitcoins (other than me).&nbsp; <br /><br />MDUK: I would consider that business plan.&nbsp; Although, handing out this inside info to whomever wants to pay for it opens up a lot of security issues.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see it being as lucrative for me to offer out this info on, say, a subscription basis. <br /><br />jpinkman: I very rarely trade blue chips. They simply do not have the volatility.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually trade small to mid cap stocks as these are the ones with the largest gap ups/downs due to news.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve never traded using any arbitrage strategy.&nbsp; The reason I&#039;d like to start a bitcoin fund is because I can&#039;t just go out and ask investors to let me use their money to trade using an illegal strategy.&nbsp; Bitcoin offers much better protection (from what i&#039;ve been reading).&nbsp; <br /><br />The more capital i have to put down on any given trade, the more I make. Simple as that.&nbsp; That&#039;s how mutual funds and hedgee funds work.&nbsp; That&#039;s what i want to do with bitcoin.

Old clichés. Clichés that have been around since way before Kiyosaki claims “rich dad” originated them. The reader further said that Kiyosaki then appears to have simply made up a bunch of accompanying phony stories to fill the cliché collection out to the length of a book.

Your expertise is such that you&#039;ve got inside info on market timings, yet you&#039;re willing to expose yourself to the bottomless risk of a short instead of limiting your risk while profiting at multiple times your investment by purchasing a put like any knowledgeable trader would do in that situation. You sound so competent I&#039;m ready to transfer you a torrent of my personal fortune right now and hire you as my financial broker.<br /><br />BUT ... first you&#039;ve got to help me get it all untangled in a uranium mine I own in Nigeria. You wire me 10,000 bitcoins so I can provide the proper kickbacks to Nigerian politicians for them to allow me to start exporting Uranium from their mines and I&#039;ll wire you back 1,000 bitcoins that I&#039;ll let you manage for me in your midcap stocks you&#039;re so great at shorting. How about it? ;D<br /><br />

				I&#039;m still waiting on you, CapitalGainer, to make a single prediction so I know that the special skillset you say you have access to exists and your source is providing verifiable, valuable intelligence.&nbsp; Otherwise, like others have indicated in this thread, if you have access to such privileged information, why are you on Tor trying to paint us a story of how awesome you are and asking for our money?<br /><br />Say something like: &quot;I have it on high authority that Verizon will be acquired by Comcast, and the announcement will go out in the next 3 days, so you should buy Verizon stock now as it will soar.&quot;

				Positives: <br />Make money with money (Oh yeah you can do that with drugs right here)<br /><br />Negatives: <br />You get new agencies going after you instead of the usual old LE<br />You work hard being a crook, make a batch of money, hand it over to &quot;a guy&quot; and then...?<br />What stock exchanges poopoo the SEC? You don&#039;t cooperate with the SEC, you don&#039;t trade in the US markets.<br /><br />Solution:<br />Give Sell the names of the stocks as they come up and I will pay you a portion of my profits doing my own trading and money laundering. You trust me don&#039;t you? That&#039;s what you were asking me to do - trust you, right? I have a sterling reputation, you are nobody.<br />Problem with that: Now I have a trading account bust and selling in exactly what LE tells me to. They don&#039;t even have to prove it&#039;s the guy selling drugs, they can just bust me for the illegal insider trading.<br /><br />This is a non-starter unless you give me several tips that all would have worked (I don&#039;t trade the first ones) and then I trade the next few and if they make money I pay you an agreed upon percentage of the earnings. Then as a trusted vendor I set up the hedge fund and control the money and make the trades for anyone wishing to do it without opening a trading account. You make the same money with less work my friend.<br /><br />Bam! Done! (Drops the mike)<br /><br />Modzi

You really are a strategic genius. You have inside info on market timings yet you insist on paying full price for a stock on short term trades instead of a fraction of that price that would net you multiple times the amount on the full price of that stock all because your of ironclad discipline in having a &quot;strategy&quot; and sticking by it. How heroic of you to turn down all that free money on principle and a strategy that no one can understand. A &quot;strategy&quot; BTW, that now involves convincing random anonymous strangers who have no way of finding out who you are to invest in your elite access to a steady flow of insider info that somehow hasn&#039;t made you enough money yet.<br /><br />I am just so impressed.<br /><br />You are clearly a man of principle whose potential to make one of us a mountain of cheddar is just mind boggling. For a minute there I almost mistook the brilliance of your financial mind to be that of John Paulson&#039;s. I say &quot;almost&quot; only because even Paulson would recognize the absurdity of paying full value for a stock when you&#039;ve got inside info that would make you so much more at a far lower cost had you just bought the option. ;D

				i had to reply to increase post count and bring light to how hilarious this post was.&nbsp; common sense tells me if hes so successful with his inside tips why does he need more money to invest.&nbsp; and wouldnt it be better to comprise a group of people to invest for you so its not linked to you.&nbsp; idk much about stocks just seemed odd.&nbsp; I did like the idea of a bitcoin hedge fund, just with maybe an escrow system and someone that wasnt an idiot running it
