				Hey was just lurking around and kinda wondered what some other SR members are doing after they receive their package. Once i remove the product and thoroughly ensure no freebies were missed (has happened with some NBOMe... :&#039;( ), i collect every scrap of paper and bags and stickers and burn them into completely disintegrated ash, which is then scattered safely. I mean maybe i am going the extra mile without really changing much, but why would i ever risk keeping any information about the vendor or about me and the product. I don&#039;t even use the bags the product is supplied in, i always change over to my own button bags or zip locks. What do you guys think and is anyone else maintaining such sterilization standards?

				I like to laminate them and put them up on this wall at the park in my neighborhood, I glue them underneath some really big graffiti that says &quot;Look LE all these packages are from SR, muahaha&quot;<br /><br />But in all seriousness I just throw them out making sure the labels are all ripped up which I do with all my mail.&nbsp; If I lived in a neighborhood where I left my trash out for garbage men and or nosey neighbors, I would probably take more extreme measures. However, I live way out in the boonies and we have to deal with trash ourselves.

				haha yea i live really far out so maybe im going a little too far, but hey i never have to get nervous. Cops sure do love to look around when they get the chance, Hence why parties are not my forte anymore. Had 5+ deputies going room to room looking for hiding kids and by chance he missed the letter full of Durban poison and the Codine Sulphate powder right in front of him. Not a feeling i would recommend experiencing yourself

				I shred the labels and toss the boxes in the recycling / trash with the rest, although vendor packaging post-arrival is not exactly at the top of my list of concerns. My everyday Amazon shipments tend to look way more shady than what vendors ship.

In all seriousness, torch it, barbeque it, whatever. Just make sure this isn&#039;t frequently practiced in view of others. You wouldn&#039;t want Mr. Peterson to take his afternoon tea on the patio, around the time the mail comes, only to frequently witness someone shadily burning envelopes. They likely wouldn&#039;t say anything, but if asked that could be rather incriminating.<br /><br />One alternative is burn the information on it and dispose of the envelopes at a park garbage or a storm drain.

				You don&#039;t need to burn them; it&#039;s not illegal to recieve packages in the mail and plus, the drugs are still going to be in your house whether you burn the packages they came in or not. <br />Needless to say, I always burn my packages, simply because I enjoy fire&nbsp; :)

				Shocked by the amount of trouble you guys go to! When I get drugs in the mail I just toss the packing in the bin and it goes out with my regular waste. Easy-as.<br /><br />What&#039;re they going to do if they find an empty jiffy bag or even some powder lying around? Call the police?! That&#039;s if they go through your sealed black bin bag and if you tossed half your drugs without taking them.

				The bag with the weed was a FULL clear bag(my first package so i didnt destroy it yet) and the white powder would warrant a closer look, but trust me when you know its drugs its not exactly easy to stay calm on the inside. But obviously that all ended well, glad too see i am not the only person to burn it. Its really not very much trouble to walk outside( i have no neighbors close to me) and burn the envelope and let the ashes spread on the lawn as i smoke a bowl or whatever that morning. I mean im not tripping that LE is gonna kick my door down and figure it all out cause of some empty envelopes and some exotic tabs under my alarm clock ;) but hey like i said, No need to keep the evidence. Did you guys read the post on the recent arrest and 5 1/2 year sentence for an SR vendor? Different circumstances but LE knows what SR is and could connect the dots.

				&nbsp;??? Check my other responses its not that i have any worry of LE or some righteous citizen going all detective on me, i just feel its the safest method. If you guys are satisfied tossing it out then please by all means continue to do such, just as i will continue to enjoy my products as i destroy my evidence. I was kinda hoping for some legit responses of things Ive never tried or heard of, but i clearly am up in the top percent of paranoid SR buyers, especially considering i dont buy bulk. But i do ship to my personal residence and this is my main motivation for all the extra precautions. On top of my packaging destruction i keep a house that appears clean to anyone but a K-9. Might as well add that i already have a clear and thought out plan in case of a CD and/or Raid. I mean i dont wanna be the guy to come post about how i just got back out of county cause i signed when anyone who has spent some time lurking here would have known to refuse.

				You can never be to careful in all this. Even if its something as quick and simple as packaging disposal, it helps to always be preparing for something to happen. I certainly don&#039;t want to find myself in a situation where I think &quot;if only I was less lazy with the packaging&quot;, or something along those lines.

				Hi, Go to staples ( stationary store) buy a cross cut shredder. Never put anything in the garbage with your name on it. Put a bin liner in the shredder, empty the bag often, and drop it off somewhere other than your home.

				my only worry about those envelopes is if they make the connection between a used return address and a vendor. if i got arrested for, lets just say a package of drugs in the mail and with a warrant they found an envelope with a return address known to used by a vendor who sells drugs through the mail. it would help them get a better picture of my activities. i look at it the same as having tor with a SR bookmark on my harddrive. its not illegal to have tor installed with a SR bookmarked but if there searching my pc because they found drugs in mail i think it helps their case when they find a website which offers drugs for sale through the mail.<br />it doesnt take much time to destroy envelopes. maybe its excessive but i dont think it hurts anything

				papermail, envelopes, even stealthy stuff inside made of paper gets burned.<br />sometimes also the plasticbaggies gets torched if they are not big enough.<br />used rigs, needles and stuff like that get desintegrated with pincers and then inserted into a empty beer or whatevercan which gets rolled up and pressed flat (that no bum comes on the remote idea of trying to catch the last drop)<br /><br />disposal is critical. large amounts of plastic baggies (especially branded ones from RC shop) i let dissove in acid, then neutralize with base and flush it down the toilet.<br /><br />people call this paranoid. i call this mandatory.
