				Quick question on MoneyPak...<br /><br />Do I have to give my SSN at the time of purchase, or when it gets used?<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if I walk with with cash, can I simply buy the card and load it with money.<br /><br />I see there are a few people on SR that will buy MP for BTC. And I&#039;m considering that, as long as I don&#039;t have to put in my SSN when I buy the MP.

				Personally I live in the US and I like to go to CVS for my MoneyPak, you go in with your cash in your pocket and grab the MP and go to the front counter ask them to put in the amount of money u desire in the moneypak, there is a 5 dollar fee on it so make sure bring extra 5 bucks. No SSN, NO any sorta of card only cash otherwise it defeats the purpose of MP. and be aware of scammers, I bought from 2 vendors, 1 is theMiddleMan, he is 100% legit got my money within 5 mins, 2 is MrSpankey, and Im starting to become worried that i might got scammed..... thats what I get for trying to go for the low fee prices....

				No SS# required , but the vendors as myself need a zipcode since the site i cash them on requires it... It would be better if you bought them at wal-mart , my local walgreens mp max is 500 USD not sure about CVS, but Walmart goes upto 1000 USD... bad thing about MoneyPaks is green dot is a pain in the ass , if your at cvs and or walgreens you can buy Vanilla reloads , and reloadits and it is much easier for me to dela with since MP usually lock my card at 1500 in sales a week so im limited to how many MP i can take a week, but working on it another angle...<br /><br />Thanks for the advertisement Deverse ill give you a 2% discount next time, remind me my friend
