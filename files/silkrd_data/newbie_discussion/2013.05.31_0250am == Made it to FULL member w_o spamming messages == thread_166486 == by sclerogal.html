				You know, I don&#039;t hate on those who want to blast thru and get there posts done. That&#039;s their thing. But there is something to be said for those who take there time and put care into crafting a message and adding value to the community. Thank you for helping build the community here. Stopping to smell the roses is something the spam kids will never get.<br /><br />Bravo.

				&nbsp;not sure if it&#039;s so great to use the newb thread to make good posts here seeing as most ppl are just figuring out the system .and the full members that read the newb thread are quite critical and easy to give you -. my two cents.<br /><br />&nbsp;i use this to up my threads with mostlly spam then go to the rumor mill and read a shit ton.not too worried about whats written here as it will be lost in noobville. ill wait till i get 50 posts and let people that care about their accounts read what good or bad i have to say. as far as the 50 post to keep people out of the other threads i think it&#039;s a good idea and should prob be 100 so vendors dont make mult accounts and give themselves great reviews or start wars with other vendors with dummy accounts.

				Thanks to all for the positive posts.&nbsp; I just wanted users to know that you can actually learn some stuff here, and possibly save yourself from a scam and loosing money, or worse getting caught. I still made some mistakes, and lost a little money, but nothing like I could have.&nbsp; Reading from the forums and listening to the moderators and senior members really does help you.&nbsp; When your new this forum it seems a little dream like, and you can become so anxious to get your 1st order in and see that it really works, you can get totally carried away and so easily get into trouble, and some mistakes you may not recover form.&nbsp; I never intended to boast or brag to the newbie forum, I just wanted to let you know spamming isn&#039;t for everyone, and I know 50, and even 100 seem tedious and time consuming but it could be very worth it. :)

				Hear, hear.<br />Stupid people have trouble seeing that some trails, no matter how tedious or seemingly irrelevant. Do have valuable purpose.<br />Those that don&#039;t will always have more chance of success in their ventures.<br />I am glad to consider myself the latter.
