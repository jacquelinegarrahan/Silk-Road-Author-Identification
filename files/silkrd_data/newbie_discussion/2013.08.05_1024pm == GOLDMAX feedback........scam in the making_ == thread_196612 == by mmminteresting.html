				This vendor looks extremely suspicious from my pov, classic scam stucture.<br /><br />Cheap/free pills to build up rep,<br />once trust is achieved offer higher priced goods with no intention to fulfill.&nbsp; Has anyone received bud of them yet?<br /><br />What&#039;s majorly suspicious is the photos of the bud....some are out of focus done on a shit camera, some look professionally done with effects and background color....obviously not taken by the same person.<br /><br />Not saying they are scammers in the making but beware<br /><br />Just had another look at their blurb....`update currently all mdma sold out hopefully will have a fresh batch in on the 31st july`&nbsp; &nbsp;`31st july 1kg of new blue mdma now in stock this mdma will blow you away if you liked the last batch you must try the blue all i can say is wow&#039;<br /><br />If you go through their old review items they havn&#039;t sold any mdma, only free mis-stamped pills.<br />Started selling other stuff aprox 5 days ago and apparently claims can take over a week to arrive, plenty time to reap the scam.<br /><br />My advice:&nbsp; Do not order until arrival and reviews are coming up for their non-samples.&nbsp; I hope to be proved wrong.

				Ok so don&#039;t FE, but I have 0 transactions in my history and the only things I want are from vendors that require newbies to FE.<br /><br />I need someone to make an exception for me, I don&#039;t want to FE!

				<br />Have you tried PM&#039;ing them to ask for them to work with you?<br /><br />Also, you can go to the market place and make some smaller transactions to get your count up. I highly recommend sniffsniff&#039;s Netflix account&#039;s. Only 5 dollars a pop.

				Lol this guy..<br /><br />I have been watching his auctions and they are so phony bologna.&nbsp; He has stolen pictures from other vendors it would appear and yes there are tons of &quot;FE will update later&quot; reviews.<br /><br />Will update later?&nbsp; Can you update later after your shit is gone?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter, this scam setup is fucking insane.&nbsp; FE is the worst fucking idea ever under any circumstances it would appear!!
