				If you&#039;re in the US, it&#039;s not illegal to simply view SR...if you&#039;re in a country like China or North Korea, then i&#039;d have to say you better hope you&#039;re covering your tracks lol...as for Europe or anywhere else really, im not too sure.

				Well, all of that depends on the country you live in and their federal, state and local laws. Generally, I would say no. It is not illegal to view silkroad for that matter. What is illegal however, is how you choose to use that resource, e.g. simply going to a website which contains documents and other information that &#039;teaches&#039; you how to grow your own weed, or create your own synthetic drugs, etc. viewing that information wouldn&#039;t &#039;technically&#039; be illegal, (unless it&#039;s under strict protection or is only for access by authorized users; such as government files, etc.) - it all goes down on how you choose to use the information. If you choose to use that information as a basis for growing your own weed, or making your own synthetic drugs, or distributing it then yes; it becomes illegal. Therefore, viewing silkroad isn&#039;t illegal, buying drugs from the marketplace however is.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the best explanation but I hope I put it in a way you could easily understand, I&#039;m sure you can find out a lot more by using a simple Google search.

				While viewing SR in most countries is itself legal, if you get arrested for something else and they seize your computer, it most certainly can be used against you in court. US prosecutors routinely use Google search histories as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure about this, but I wonder if evidence of using TOR could be grounds for a search warrant?

				As far as my understanding of US law goes, it is illegal to visit silk road if you have the intention of using it for illegal purposes. Of course LE has to prove that you intended to use it for illegal purposes, and if you didn&#039;t actually use it - that would be pretty near impossible to prove.

				Shamiroqai said it best, it&#039;s not illegal to look at beer in the store so why should it be illegal to look at drugs on the internet? Hell, you can look at online pharmacies that offer a lot of the products that are on SR and those businesses are legal.

It is just highly suspicious, in the same way that a bunch of 16 year olds hang out in a liquor store would be seen as suspicious by the owner. There&#039;s nothing wrong with it, but once the owner, or in the case of SR, the &quot;AUTHORITIES&quot; know you are are doing it, they are more likely to be keeping an eye on you. In Australia, I reckon the feds would take a good hard look at you, and your PC and everything you do, and in the process, you could lose everything, cos not many employers will hold onto someone who is associated with SR, or employ someone known to have &quot;drug issues&quot;<br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Dimitry from Strays

What is up with the gun control B.S.?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been hearing this sentiment a lot lately that things aren&#039;t looking very good for us Americans in the future as far as our freedoms go. And I have to admit there are some thins happening that causes concern. Patriot act, NDAA, now the recent push for gun control which some believe will eventually lead to gun confiscation and a gun ban. On the subject of gun control there were some pics circulating on the internet about DHS training their people to shoot gun holding civilian looking targets including the likes of pregnant ladies, children, and the elderly. Is this legit? If so, very disturbing. <br /><br />My only question is what can we truly do? When learning about dictatorships in history classes while growing up I was always fascinated with how the people could have possibly let it happen. It&#039;s always this feeling of this will never happen to me, or this would never happen here, things won&#039;t get that bad etc.&nbsp; But the signs would be there and I guess we as humans tend to enter denial when faced with highly unpleasant things. Can&#039;t help but wonder if many of us are falling into the same trap. <br /><br />I&#039;m seriously thinking about maybe moving to another country before shit hits the fan but I&#039;m not sure which country. How&#039;s Canada doing on the whole liberty and freedoms situation in comparison to America? Plus not sure if I want to leave all my family and love ones. It&#039;s a tough decision but if things get worse I will ponder it deeper and deeper.

				Food for thought:<br /><br />I think if you want to get to the bottom of what&#039;s behind any world event or series of events, always take a look at who (which government or powerful entity) stands to benefit from it the most. Very similar to the old &quot;follow the money&quot; adage....<br /><br />And as for our guns.....<br /><br />I don&#039;t think we&#039;re in for any sweeping legislation quite yet, as even quite of the more liberal leaning folks here aren&#039;t quite comfortable with the idea of giving up guns - a lot of them just aren&#039;t being too vocal about it, for fear of not appearing liberal enough...<br /><br />My take on it is that it&#039;s too late to take away guns. Even the lower quality ones are made to close enough tolerances that you could put one in a box for 500 years and when you pulled it out, it would still be functional. Maybe the ammo would fail but, my point is - guns take a lot time to disintegrate / fall apart on their own. If you take away our guns, only the criminals will have them.<br /><br />If all guns would suddenly evaporate and be gone from the planet, I would be fine with that, but that&#039;s not going to happen.<br /><br />And eventually, doesn&#039;t every government use weapons against it&#039;s own citizens? It&#039;s naive to think that couldn&#039;t happen here....

For instance say you have kids and you go into your kids room and still see Silk Road on the screen, As soon as you realise what it is, Its illegal.

But it&#039;s probably too late for that now, and especially after this gun control law because now everyone is crowding gun stores like its a grand opening for wal-mart.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is better to have a gun and not need one, than to need a gun and not have one.<br /><br />If you have your government assess firearm owners mental capacities in a thorough way, less psychopathic murderers will have access to them.<br /><br />This comes from a dude in Australia, where civilian ownership of automatic and semi-automatic rifles has been outlawed. Now only the military and police have automatic and semi-automatic firearms so the government is one step ahead of any kind of protesting about anything. They try to control us like marionettes, they tell us what we want, they tell us what we can and cannot do, they tell us when we can and cannot do it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let your government take your guns, if you do, your country will go down the shitter, just like this one.<br /><br />ImSoBad: You appear to have a lot of faith in the people who run and secure the country you live in. People you have never met once in your life and the only thing you likely know about these people is what you here off glitzy morning television programs. These people have literally millions of automatic weapons and if they order their subordinates to do so, they will murder you and your family without thinking twice about it.<br />Now you may not have a problem with this, but myself and millions of other people in this world do have a very big problem with that. We only want the same type of security that the politicians have for themselves, to be able to defend our lives and our property with equal force.
