			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello fellow SR users, Sheeplog here new to the SR scene but not the drug scene, for a really long time I&#039;ve been wanting to try a psychedelic and I can&#039;t decide between the powder form of mushrooms that some vendors sell or LSD, (which i have no idea how to take, i saw something about putting it on your gums?) Can you guys offer some recommendations and advice I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve barely got any btc&#039;s so please nothing over .25, unless you feel like donating to the cause !&nbsp; ;D I&#039;d write a full and extensive review being my first time purchasing and tripping . I await your reply&#039;s !&nbsp; 8)

				I personally would advise LSD instead of mushrooms! LSD is one of my favorite drugs and is very fun. Mushrooms are good to but i don&#039;t like eating them and they have made me sick on a couple of occasions!

				I would suggest you start with normal 110 LSD blotters because they are simply the best! when you get enough experience with those you can try some different stuff&nbsp; 8) cheers

				Dried mushrooms.&nbsp; Hand-picked in Georgia USA.&nbsp; A positive high that can be controlled.&nbsp; Blotter is more intense, and you can&#039;t wish it away when you&#039;re tired of it.&nbsp; n

				I prefer shrooms. Just my opinion. However, disclaimer, I haven&#039;t done LSD. For me, I just stick to natural drugs. Weed and shrooms (and peyote assuming I could ever find some!).

				At Wakarusa I tripped mushies one day and L the next two days. The lsd trips were WAY more relaxing and I felt like I could keep myself under control while still being in complete bliss. Nothing beats really clean LSD.

				For a good lsd trip, how much would be needed for 2 people?&nbsp; I am not familiar with dosage at all. And any recommended vendors? From reading the comments here, may give it a try.

				Shrooms would be better if your not that experienced with tripping, also get a trip sitter just incase.<br /><br />I tried LSD during the winters of 2011, I made a pizza, thought i stabbed myself, ran outside in like 10 inchs of snow running down my road rippin my cloths of, with cars driving past me. Lol<br /><br />I thought I saw god at the end of it, and he bitched me out.<br />Who knows dude I took to big ass blots cut from a sheet.<br /><br />Maybe if you take a low, low amount of acid your first time you&#039;l be fine, just dont over do it like I did.

				Hi Sheeplog, I will be vending again soon and I&#039;d be happy to send you some mushroom samples. Once I&#039;ve hit 50 posts I&#039;ll fire up my product samples thread again and make sure to save one for you. I&#039;m looking to send them out sometime next week. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a website that can help you prepare for your experience: <br /><br />http://www.disregardeverythingisay.com/page/2<br /><br />The best advice I can offer to anyone embarking in a psychedlic journey is to have a clear mind that is free of stress and worries. If you have any deadlines or personal issues it would be best to wait till your mind is in a more stable state. Psychedelics are not something you can lean on like alcohol to help you forget your problems. <br />

				Take BOTH! Hahaha I think they are two pretty different drugs, mushrooms is similar to acid sort of but it has a stronger effect on your thought process while acid basically just lets you hallucinate and be relatively coherent.&nbsp;

				I feel like each person is different. For me LSD has more visuals then shrooms and is more euphoric. I find shrooms give me a mind fuck with less visuals but more of the tripped out feeling mentally.
