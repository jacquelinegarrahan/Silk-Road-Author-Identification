				Ok, deal here was I wanted a more recognizable forum name for vendors. My original name was emera1d (the L is a number 1). Because of my real SR username, I thought &quot;emeraald&quot; would be better and help vendors recognize me. (My account name isn&#039;t used here because I used a stupid one [was in a hurry..] linked to my real name, plus &quot;emeraald&quot; has no former ties to me whatsoever, whereabouts, or name. If I can prove I&#039;m the same person as emera1d, CAN WE BUMP UP MY POST COUNT combining my old ones and these? I had no idea of this new 50 post rule because I was gone awhile, and these new things with karma. It&#039;s been awhile but I have almost a 1.5yr history here on the Road. PLEASE LET ME KNOW CAUSE THIS SUCKS, I&#039;m not a noob and know my stuff! I&#039;m supposed to get a new batch from OPI (H) today and REALLY want to review it properly!

				Screw this, I&#039;m going to keep this thread up until my next, what four or six or whatever are done, then fix the new username- Maybe work it out with SR mods then. few more posts to go even though I sure ain&#039;t no noob..

				Told ya! At least I&#039;m not typing stupid gibberish (Hey mods, please do something about that crap..), and instead I am legitimately mad.... (lol obviously, I&#039;m the thread starter...)

				Oh, and about the stupid gibberish thing I&#039;ve seen I mentioned (twice now), PR (pharmacy reviewer as you all know..) had a huge issue with that because of their 50 post minimum into the Senior Section. All you Mods gotta do is increase required character length per post and that will do the trick- stop &quot;asdfgdsgdfgd&quot; crap. Like I said, I&#039;m not a noob and have our best interest at heart!

				Three ta go (geez, I shouldn&#039;t even have to be doing this, my new acct has three posts..) and wtf does the -1 karma mean here? (I know, just saying.. Probably northern dancer if she is still up to her tricks, or some idiot I called out in the H section for, well, being an idiot.)<br /><br />Sorry this is just the only place I can post even though I&#039;m not new... lol.. or I&#039;d be talking about bitcoins or whatever.

				Last one, thank god I can go post in the other forums if I have to. Honestly I&#039;m not sure what else to say other than &quot;asdfsdfs&quot; like ppl have been doing since I&#039;ve been around and got stuck in this rule change.. Anyways, now for the real forums, and to work on the forum name I really want.
