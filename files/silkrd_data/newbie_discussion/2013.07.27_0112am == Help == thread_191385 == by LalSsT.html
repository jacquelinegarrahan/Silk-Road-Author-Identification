				Ordered weed from a reputable vendor, I knew package was running late so brought it up with him. He then linked me to USPS tracking which stated the package was delivered a few days ago. It was not. Maybe some postal worker figured out what it was and ran off with it? At a loss at what to do.&nbsp;

				you might check with your neighbors and even ask the carrier - if you can&#039;t be there, leave a note in your mailbox explaining your pkg is missing&nbsp; (and a printout showing the package shows delivered). <br /><br />not sure what&#039;s going on with the PO, it may be budget constraints from sequester, or whatever, but we&#039;ve had the same carrier here for 11-12 years - super lady, and always gets our mail right. Up until about 6-8 months ago - all of a sudden we&#039;d find a lot of mail in our box that was meant for our neighbor - we&#039;d go over to their box to put their mail in it and find some of our in their box. I noticed a few weeks back she seems to be hauling ass, when delivering, so it may be she&#039;s been given more territory for her route and has to cover more ground in the same work shift<br /><br />if your carrier delivered it to the wrong house, odds are 50/50 he&#039;ll remember your pkg and which mail box he put it in - from what our carrier explained to us one time, she sorts the mail for her route before leaving the post office, putting it in cardboard trays set up by the way she drives her route<br /><br />fwiw

There goes your plausible denability in the instance that the contents have been figured out. Sorry, but for safetys sake, that&#039;s the stupidest fucking idea I have read on SR in a long time.
