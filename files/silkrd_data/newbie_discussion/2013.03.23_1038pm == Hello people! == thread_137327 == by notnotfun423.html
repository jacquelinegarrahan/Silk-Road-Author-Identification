				If you don&#039;t mind waiting you could go grab a moneypak and use a trusted vendor to turn it to BTC for you.<br /><br />I was on the road a few months ago and this was a really effective way to get btc then, but now it seems that there is much more demand than supply. I used SugarMama to exchange a MP recently and it took about two days, but I think she went out of her way to help me out. I think SugarMama will use a few different methods to exchange for you, and I think she is very trustworthy, search her name in SR.<br /><br />I also just did a trial run and used bitinstant to get a little bit of btc. Bitinstant ---&gt; give fake personal info ----&gt; go pay at the store ----&gt; pay to instawallet ---&gt; xfer to SR<br /><br />If your paranoid this isn&#039;t really the best way, cause you are on camera and all. But I&#039;m really very doubtful that it&#039;s worth the work to track someone down, especially if your not using a lot of money. But I&#039;m sure someone thinks this is a bad idea.

				All good advice above. I normally don&#039;t tell people to go to search (I like to help :) ) but this is a case where you&#039;re better off doing a search. There&#039;s plenty of good information out there, and while it&#039;s more time consuming than someone just taking you step by step, you&#039;ll learn more about the whole process and be able to adapt when complications come up, like bitinstant going down. If you&#039;re really having trouble after a couple days, shoot me a pm. Best of luck<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137327.msg932111#msg932111">Quote from: RudolfRassendyll on March 23, 2013, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If your paranoid this isn&#039;t really the best way, cause you are on camera and all.

Buying bitcoins is legal -- that&#039;s why you can do it at WalMart. The only legally questionable part comes when you&#039;re far from the cameras, transferring those bitcoins anonymously to your SR wallet using them to buy drugs and get soooooo hiiiiiiigh

				Yeah I&#039;m pretty sold on the bitinstant thing. I think that&#039;s the path I&#039;ll take from now on.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think a normal person needs to be paranoid, but if someone is already very worried about everything on here, they might prefer to work it out some way with more security.

				Thanks for all the speedy responses. I live in the uk so not able to get bit coins at Wal -mart ect. but will look more closely at some other threads. I&#039;m not that techy and it goes a bit over my head to be honest.<br /><br />SR is a truly awesome site with some mouth watering products! <br /><br />Peace

It took all of a day or two after drooling over products, practically jizzing my pants, before I started spending. It&#039;s addicting, though. SR is a drug in itself. The more successful transactions you make, the more comfortable you get, and the more you want to make! I love this place. Hope it sticks around for a while.<br /><br />Getting bitcoins does seem confusing at first, but once you get it, it&#039;s easy. That said, I filled up a while ago, so I&#039;ll probably have to look up how to do it again next time I buy lol.
