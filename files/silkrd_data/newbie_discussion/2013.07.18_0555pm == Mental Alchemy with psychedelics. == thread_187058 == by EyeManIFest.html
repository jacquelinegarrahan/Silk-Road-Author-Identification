				Hey guys.&nbsp; This is my religion.&nbsp; Take trips with an intent.&nbsp; I have had great results using this as a form of ritual religion.&nbsp; Anyone else delve into this arena?&nbsp; I use the kyballion and hermeticisim as my guide :)

				Will include a bit of background:<br /><br />once, on allad +2cb, I was in back yard, looking up at the stars, super high.&nbsp; I started to get flickering visions.&nbsp; As i looked up; the stars starting moving in very fast patterns in the sky.&nbsp; this event locked my minds eye into a trance where i perceived everything as following a particular sequence of mathematics.&nbsp; I started thinking how the mathematics in the sky could dictate my inner self traveled path as a soul being here on earth. <br /><br />During this same trip -i was walking around the front part of my house, basically in circles, from one room to the next, thinking out my trip.&nbsp; at this point&nbsp; i started noticing the paths i was walking leaving trails of lines behind me.&nbsp; After who knows how long?&nbsp; These trails of pattern started to look like orbits of planets.&nbsp; The planets formed as emotional states i could attain, these emotional states had interplay with each other, with cause and effect<br /><br />this is when i started becoming conscious of using psychedelics to metaprogram, and as a form of deep magick.

				to me that is the drug working and not real alchemy. The art of transmutation works best when the inner spirit is clean. Even tho the body may have stuff in it&#039;s system for days or weeks or months the spiritual consciousness can be purged thru meditation and proper thinking.<br /><br />It really takes some time of putting the exercises into play before seeing the evidence of mental alchemy. The art of transmuting a negative vibration into a positive vibration and being able to notice the change in reality right before your very eyes is very hard to except when your tripping.

				Not the drug alone, the drug is a tool.&nbsp; I have a complete understanding in reaching high states of consciousness sober, but without the psychedelics i find it almost impossible to concentrate my energy and attention long and strong enough to get a faster than slow response.&nbsp; Law of attraction work great for me when sober, but response time is a bit slow.&nbsp; When i&#039;m dealing with some real shit, strong medicines are my preferred tool.&nbsp; Trust me, Mental Alchemy is possible with psychedelics. It may be very hard for the average person to do, especially if they trip in a non ritual fashion with no understanding of intent.&nbsp; The art of transmutation works best when it actually works, regardless if your on drugs or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the psychedelic, I focus on intent,&nbsp; sync/ match that lower vibration, and apply the opposite polarized correspondences to a higher vibration.&nbsp; At this point of realization the intent will cause an effect on the lower vibrations, taking complete control over them -manifesting them into a new usable form of energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know some will have trouble believing what i say.&nbsp; During one experience, I did what can only be described as a type of distant healing.&nbsp; This actually resulted in the person i targeted being healed, and me myself, getting very sick for several months.&nbsp; It took me a long while to understand what was happening, I then performed another rite, which healed myself very quickly.&nbsp;
