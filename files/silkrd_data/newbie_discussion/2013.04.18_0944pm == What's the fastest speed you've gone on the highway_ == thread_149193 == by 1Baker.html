				110mph I think? I&#039;ve never had a car that went past 120 on the dash haha, so anything over 115mph tends to feel loose and shaky. Maybe one day when I get that Lambo, though... ;)

The guy took some small amount of pity on me, for whatever reason. The ticket was in an isolated county several hours away from my university, and I did have to appear to contest or pay, didn&#039;t. This resulted in my license being revoked for a year. It could have been worse :X

				I might have gone as far as 100 and I regret it. In the US we have a sort of fuzzy system where the limit is 65, but getting ticketed for 75 and less is considered a dick move for cops. A few states have 70 or 75 (or at least used to) and it was actually enforced in that 76 got you a ticket and 75 didn&#039;t.<br /><br />Honestly, given the amount of fatalities car accidents cause in this country, you should be getting prison time for unsafe driving, not petty fines. Drugs might harm me, but if you drive irresponsibly, you&#039;re killing other human beings who didn&#039;t consent to that risk. Although I guess really slow drivers really piss me off, too. But that&#039;s an inconvenience, not a death sentence.

				I have a couple of bikes and I have had both my GSX-R 1000 and R-1 up to the limit the speedo stops counting which is ~187-188. Both have had engine work though and once i let off the throttle they stayed at the max for a few second before starting to count down. The speedos aren&#039;t incredibly accurate at high speeds but I imagine I was easily doing 170-175 if not more. Easy to do because the state I live in has some long, straight highways and desolate roads. I rode my frined&#039;s turbo charged Hyabusa and that will easily clear 200 mph. That might be the single scariest thing I have ever done in my life.

It had been bored and stroked, all new internal engine parts, rev limiter bypassed. the whole nine yards. The guy has been riding a lot longer than me though and he handles it pretty good. I can&#039;t keep up with him on a straight road and I have a nice gixxer. I can tear his ass up in the curves though. He drag races the bike a lot I guess. I don&#039;t know why else you would want a Hyabusa with a turbo. Thing breaks down a lot as well.
