				MDA is fully psychedelic, way more so than MDMA. It&#039;s like the visuals and mindset of acid mixed with the speediness/jitteriness of meth. And the comedown is pretty rough. Take 3-4 pressed MDA pills and you will trip balls for 10 hours.

				Iboga!<br />I&#039;d love to go ahead &amp; try it, I could order some from the road, but i want to visit the Iboga House (Google it), it&#039;s sort of like a resort for a few days,&nbsp; I feel like it would be the best first-time Iboga experience, if not just the best Iboga experience possible. You get a journey provided by a tenth generation shaman &amp; you have options on which, &quot;package&quot;, I guess you can choose from, they have several options, one for helping drug addictions, psychical healings, Bwiti Initiation(what I wanna attempt!), &amp; psycho-spiritual Journeys. <br />I&#039;m just waiting for me to get into the right financial situation, I guess, haha.

				Looking at Moxy (5-MeO-MiPT), 2C-B, and GHB (Thanks to BlueGiraffe!) sometime soon - not all at once, of course! Think all would be fun and rewarding.<br />One that I have found not a lot of people have tried that I was lucky to try was Foxy (5-MeO-DiPT). Really neat trip.

				Would like to try:<br /><br />Tiletamine!<br />Mescaline (I once sampled some tea from pulped Peyote buttons, but the effects were only mildly noticeable.)<br />I guess Opium (One of my first experiences smoking weed in my youth was ripping a carb/bowl of all its resin desperately with a friend. Only we later discovered that our friend&#039;s older brother had been smoking copious amounts of opium in it the afternoon while we were in school. That remains a high water mark in levels of intoxication.<br />PCP, any exotic dissociative<br />Iboga<br />Ayahuasca<br />5-Br-DMT!! <br /><br />Read this article, if you haven&#039;t already. Highly fascinating.<br />http://www.vice.com/read/sea-dmt-000481-v20n3<br /><br />Favorites:<br /><br />Ketamine!<br />LSD, of course<br />Mushrooms<br />Nitrous Oxide<br />MDMA<br />DMT / Pharmahuasca<br />

				Interesting thread.<br /><br />I would like to try:<br />2C-B<br />LSD<br />psilocybin mushrooms<br />GHB<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried a psychedelic.<br /><br />I would actually appreciate any advice about 2C-B because I am considering taking it very soon at a rave, but I am having second thoughts now. I&#039;ve only ever tried MDMA and pills before. I&#039;ve heard it was good for the comedown, so I was gonna take MDMA like usual and then the 2C-B after a few hours. But then I read that some people throw up on it and it got me worried. I don&#039;t want that to happen at a rave, and now that I know that, I might be worrying about it, which could affect the trip. How likely is it, or am I worrying for nothing?

				4 MAR most of all.&nbsp; It is the only stim I&#039;ve heard Methamphetamine fans say competes with meth with relative consistancy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next on the list would be Ibogaine;&nbsp; it seems to be a very interesting hallucionegen.

				Heroin and acid. I don&#039;t ever want to take them either though.<br /><br />For one, I hate hallucinations. So why take acid.<br /><br />Second, heroin to me is for some reason &quot;over the edge&quot; or too fucked up, if you will.

But those who like it, generally LOVE it. If you are comfortable with --very-- long trips (24+ hours) and have tried some other psychedelics first, then give it a try. I find 3-4mg to be a good dose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The length of the trip was one of the draws to it for me personally, and I&#039;ve dabbled much in all manner of psychedelics so I&#039;m pretty lucid in that state. How would you describe the overall tone, intensity, characteristics of the DOB trip ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Different people respond differently to psychedelics. That&#039;s why it&#039;s good to try a range of different ones to find out what suits you. <br /><br />For me, DOB is a crystal-clear trip. There&#039;s no body load whatsoever, and my intellect stays totally sharp. No, it gets sharper. It&#039;s like a nootropic for me. But at the same time as being completely clear-headed (and able to eat, take a nap, go to a meeting later in the trip), there&#039;s this incredible synergy between everything. Ideas flow and there&#039;s loads of euphoria. It&#039;s also quite visual..... patterns moving around on objects, really bright colours, music sounds incredible.<br /><br />But then, some people hate it. So, YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary) :)

A good time to take 2C-B is 2-3 hours into an MDMA trip. This protocol was the original combo for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
