				Need to have a drug test for potential employment. Not a heavy smoker but smoke around 1-2 pipes per night not over weight, low body fat and athletic. Haven&#039;t smoked for a week was wondering people&#039;s thoughts if I started taking cytomel?? Being a fat burner techniqually that should help burn the thc off? Thoughts :)

				You could try chugging water before the test to dilute your urine.&nbsp; Some tests check for this though.&nbsp; If you do that make sure to take a b-vitamin so your pee will still be yellow.&nbsp; First piss of the day is always dirtiest.<br /><br />I guess cytomel burns fat?&nbsp; Might help, not sure.&nbsp; I took drug tests for home confinement.&nbsp; Do they test it on the spot or send it off to a lab?&nbsp; The lab would catch dilute piss, not sure about instant result tests (I was already clean and on home confinement, so no need to dilute).&nbsp; They totally knew I chugged water to dilute the test when it went to the lab, judge was pissed (pun intended).&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Best of Luck to You.

				It all depends on how much time you have, but you should use:<br />Niacin<br />Cranberry Juice<br />Alot of Cardio (not the day of)<br />Alot of water<br />Sit in a sauna taking breaks to drink water and rehydrate* (apparently you lose brain cells from dehydration according to a new study)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you do that make sure to take a b-vitamin so your pee will still be yellow.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes^<br /><br />If you have more than a week and a half I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about diluting your piss, although, it would be a nice safety net if you feel like you didn&#039;t prepare well.

				Burning fat will help rid you of THC, but you don&#039;t want to burn fat close to the test as that will only release THC from fat to your urine.<br /><br />Drink a lot of water and make it the third or fourth piss of the day at least... and catch it midstream.

				Cannabis can be detected in urine for 3 months or more. Depends on how much THC is stored in your body.&nbsp; Drinking a lot of water(referred to as &quot;flushing&quot;) will result in nothing being detected however it is likely to raise a red flag if your urine is too dilute.&nbsp; Screens test for creatinine levels which reveal how dilute the urine is.&nbsp; This could result in a warning that it may be a false negative result. If you can, get a sample from someone else.&nbsp; Only someone you really know and trust.

				or you could just buy the fake pee. put it in a condom is what i use to do after i washed all the lube offed. get a bowl of hot water right before you leave your house to go to the drug test and dip the condom that has the fake pee or real person&#039;s pee in the water and have a thermometer by you. take it out after a second and check it let it get to 107 degrees tie it to your boxers where the flap is for your penis and the elestick band that holds them to your wast but not to tight it is easy to do it to tight then its a bitch getting off. keep it close to your body this keeps the temp nice and fresh if they check the temp of it. simply untie and pour and do away with the condom after you get out of the building. works for me anyway.&nbsp; ::) ::) ::)

				how long till the drug test? if its another week, then don&#039;t smoke till then and you&#039;ll have a very good chance of giving a clean test. i&#039;ve known people in jail give a test less than a week after smoking weed and still come up clean. that 28 days they say it can stay in your system is just a max, it doesn&#039;t mean it will always stay in your system for 28 days. especially if you are only a light smoker.<br /><br />however, with that said. do you think its such a great idea, as a smoker, to apply for a job with a company that drug tests its employees? it will only be a matter of time before you go to work one day and they pull a surprise drug test on everyone, and you&#039;ll be out the door again.

				i wouldn&#039;t walk around with a condom full of someone else&#039;s piss in my pants for no job. that could burst way too easy, lol. and its way easier to unscrew a bottle cap than untie a condom, and more discreet.

				yea well to stay out of jail i definitely would thats what i had to do unforinitly it works though. and na you get it all ready right before you go trust me that thing ant going to burst it only does that when there is a lot of friction hints why it brakes during sex. but yes the fear of it maybe coming untied or something would be miserable. but i dont have the money for the hole fake penis set up so i created my own. a cheaper and simple version. to me they made me always lift up my shirt and empty my pockets so i could&#039;nt even do the fake penis even if i wanted to.&nbsp;
