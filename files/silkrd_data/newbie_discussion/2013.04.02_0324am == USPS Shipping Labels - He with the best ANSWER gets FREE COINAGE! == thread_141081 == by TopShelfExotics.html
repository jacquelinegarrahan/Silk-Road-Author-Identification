				We&nbsp; had a question about printing labels. What service with USPS is recommended to print postage with out any one banging on my door if a package does not make it and they trace the purchase of the label to me?<br />Basically process should we use to print our labels? We will ship everything in DriShields Bags and done properly with out an expense to spare...<br />&quot;Anyone can sell, the tricky part is getting it there&quot; <br />YOU SAFETY IS OUR MAIN PRIORITY!<br />Strains to protect....<br />Girl Scout Cookies - F1<br />Sour Diesel - East Coat Favorite<br />OG KUSH -&nbsp; &quot;Old Florida Crippy&quot;<br />Sherbert - The new one...<br />Sweet Anus - Yep new as well<br />And all Northern Cali FIRE!<br />Thanks<br />PS...Best Answer wins a samp or a little COINAGE!<br />TopShelfExotics

				I would advise printing off your own labels with a cheap printer and A4 sheets of blank stickers that you can buy from any office supplies shop. MS office as well as the much preferred free alternative OpenOffice have templates premade so you can just add in your addresses into text fields and just print off.<br /><br />For added stealth stick in a made up company logo and name to print along the edges of your stickers.<br /><br />Just go to your local stationary shop and ask for printable adhesive labels. Just be careful not to leave fingerprints on the back of them when sticking them to parcels, use latex gloves when packaging is general good advice.<br /><br />1AWuRuwPDkv7BB1FvDX8UPwDZp1AfECP8h ----- If you feel like giving me coins<br /><br />:)

				Not big on shipping proceedures, but might be worth it to invest in a business grade printer to print your own labels. Safest anyway. and way better than hand-written, thats suspicious!

				With stamps.com you are required to have it as a monthly service. Clickstamponline.com is cheaper and then there is e-stamp too. I think the best bargain and overall ease of use is http://www.endicia.com. It&#039;s got a free trial, you dont have to have a different printer exclusively for printing labels, and overall the company is just on top of their game. Good luck. There may be other I&#039;m unaware of.

				Read ALL because two methods first is completely anon and second is semi-anon ...<br /><br /><br />1) you can also buy tracking numbers in &quot;bulk&quot; at the postal service because they no longer do &quot;Delivery Confirmation&quot; as of March 4th , 20123 only tracking, I found someone had bought a tracking number sticker it is about the size of a CC and accidentally left it on the counter of the automated service, I bought the stamps printed out to send it, the sticker contained a barcode with number for the tracker,, I out it on the package and I could track it! so basically the tracking number is not tried to the package until they make that first scan at he post&nbsp; click in the city,state and zip and that is all that is needed for them as the postman/woman verifies the addy on the package then scans the sticker at drop off and then the tracking says &quot;Delivered in (ie) Des Moines,Iowa 44444 at 2:03&quot; since they do not include the addy for tracking, so they do not enter the full addy to connect the tracking label to the package just the arrival zip and city then press enter as to save time, then when it gets to said zip code they delver the package via the addy on package and scan it delivered and that is why the address is not shown on tracking as they only need final destination zip. <br /><br />2)You can use stamps.com with pre-paid VISA m fake info and good drop location created with fake info.. they wil veen send free scale,, now that tracking number which is all that is displayed only tracks back to the city,state you shipped from, I had a legit business and used it and it adds your company name to it and everything and it only contains your shipping tracking number as they are VERY small, almost stamp size.. I will even send you the stickers free of charge to your address of choice and your &quot;Welcome kit&quot; contains a few free sheets but it will only trace back to you city and state.. <br /><br />Any questions PM me, I have postal employee smoking Hookah Shisha with me sitting next to me in my living room right NOW,, PM me if you feel I am worthy of said donation of coins,,,, THANKS!<br /><br />
