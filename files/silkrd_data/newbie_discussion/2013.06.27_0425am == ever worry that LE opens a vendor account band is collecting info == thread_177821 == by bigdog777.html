				I&#039;m sure LE are probably targeting the sellers, rather than the buyers<br /><br />But hey I am sure anything is possible!<br /><br />All the more reason to encrypt messages (in case of an account take over), and just be mindful of who you are purchasing from.

				Be very interesting if LE opened up and vendor account. In order for them to be trusted they would have to have a client base and in order for them to get a client base, they would have to break the law and risk getting himmed up themselves. But then again, the way the law works these days, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they wasn&#039;t even accountable.

				You know I had this same paranoid thought a while ago, and I thought about posting it on the SR forums, but then my paranoid brain was like &quot;no dude, don&#039;t give them any ideas. i bet LE reads the forums.&quot; Of course then I realized I probably am not the only one to think of this. I really hope they don&#039;t though, they need to leave the buyers alone.

				It just seems to me they would go after lower hanging fruit. As long as you take proper security precautions, and deny the package is yours, any average attorney could get you off.<br /><br />There are more than enough people making in person purchases on the street to keep them busy.

				I also had some similar thoughts like this about LE posing as vendors. but you can rest easy knowing LE care about big fish, and the occasional small fish just to prove to their higher ups that they can get people from here. as far as sending poison, i highly doubt it..but bunk drugs ( like cocaine from way back in the day that lost its potency due to time ) i could see that happening. but then again they would lose their vendor status. <br />my theory is, that LE are some of the scammers we see. they accept orders and get addresses and names of their customers and they are compiling some kind of priorty list of some kind on who to take down first. but then again its just all speculation.<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t necessarily put it past them. I think they&#039;d more likely bust a vendor and as part of plea arrangement get the vendor to cough up the account username and password and their private key, then go on with listings, trying to catch big buyers who are likely reselling. For this to happen might then sow distrust amongst SR users which would be to their advantage. Consider that the FBI did bust that child porn site some time back and continued to operate it so that they could bust subscribers. So it is not out of the realm of possibility for them to do it with a vendor account.

				Ha guys, you you can get on the main thread you will see this topic come up again and again. To save your paranoia (which is healthy, do not get me wrong, you need some to stay aware and alive) - I will just say this.<br /><br />&nbsp;It costs a lot of money to stake someone out, so yes, there maybe vendor accounts but you can usually spot them, they just don&#039;t ring true, but even they cost money and unless the DEA or DAFT (alcohol, firearm and tobacco) or whatever the USA alphabet soup agencies call themselves, they just do not have the money to finance this kind of operation unless they can guarantee a 99% prosecution result. And this is up to the Prosecuting DA, they will not waste tax payers money when there is a bigger fish to fry.<br /><br />So take precautions, assume you might get busted and the LE might come and take your computer away but always remember the following:<br />1) It is legal to but Bitcoins<br />2) Say nothing except &quot;I want a Lawyer&quot; if you ever get busted bu the FEDs or local police. There is even a digital book about it on SR under books, Cost 0.01BTC<br />Buy it, its called something like &quot;What to do if the FBI knocks on your Door&quot;<br />But basically it says &quot;shut up until you get your lawyer present&quot;<br />Hope this helps.<br />

				Try growing your own. If you have a few mates that can chip in to buy the lights and the seeds etc, and an attic (or basement at a push) there are a load of books available free on the darknet and probably the clearnet too if you know how to ask the right question.
