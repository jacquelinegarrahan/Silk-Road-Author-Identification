				Without getting into specifics.. I will make an observation after watching this drama unfold the last couple of days here. A persons personal information is serious shit. I think people don&#039;t appreciate the virtues of making it a habit to always use privnote or PGP, to always be smart, to guard your identity like a hawk. One slipup could potentially throw your entire life into turmoil. I know we expose ourselves to some degree here as buyers and to some degree as vendors. But.. realize that your identity and personal information is the one thing you should always take great pains to secure. Whether you are a squeaky clean model citizen, or a monster who is always upto no good IRL. Everyone has skeletons in their closets.. and even those who don&#039;t should not for one minute think that personal info is anything to ever be lax about.<br /><br />/end observation.
