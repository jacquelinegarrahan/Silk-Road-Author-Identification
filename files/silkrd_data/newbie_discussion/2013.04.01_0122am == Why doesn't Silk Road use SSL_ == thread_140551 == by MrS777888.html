				I often ask this as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not sure.&nbsp; As a web developer I say the same thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it has to do with TOR. It would become too slow with all the duplicate encryption.&nbsp; I know hey can&#039;t use multimedia on these sites on TOR.

				All that would be required is the page you type you address into is to use a technology called SSL (Secure Sockets Layers). It means no one would have to bother with PGP.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same technology banks use for their sites. I mean you never see them asking to send PGP versions of your login details do you?
