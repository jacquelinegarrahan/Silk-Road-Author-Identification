If it were me, i&#039;d have written them off 2 weeks ago and stopped using that address ever again.<br /><br />Perhaps somebody from down-under will be able to provide better insight than I though.<br /><br />Laissez-faire!

Don&#039;t use the address/s you used for at least 6 months at a minimum&nbsp; ;D NEVER ORDER from NL.&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; It&#039;s a known world wide drug hot-spot and packages/mail face extra scrutiny when going through Customs. A few items will always get through but the risks are too high to even consider ordering from there. The U.K is generally fine however a few people have been recently complaining about no shows from the U.K.<br />There are other countries which are known to Customs for drug importations which either should be avoided or used if you must!

NL is a country I have always avoided (after my 2nd or 3rd order on SR never arrived from NL) and in doing so, have been lucky with my orders arriving. As tempting as NL is with some great looking products at reasonable prices to order, there is just too much risk involved for it to be a viable option for me.

				Cheers for all the replies...damn i was still holding some hope because other international orders (legal - clothes nd whatknot) had been delivered unopened by customs...if they have intercepted my order surely they would be going thru the rest of my mail? Think i will just stick to domestic for now
