				Ok so for all the people that have no idea how to purchace BTC or for those that just dont know where to get it,here&#039;s an easy(ISH) way to get BTC <br />I&#039;m in no way an affiliate of any 3rd party BTC or any other virtual currency seller.<br />Virvox are NOT the scammer&#039;s who post spam.<br />Second life is a virtual world,in a virtual world you need virtual money,enter your card detail&#039;s on the main account page buy the $L(inworld currency) open the map travel to London Hyde park and look for DX exchange machine next to the coffee shop by the lake if it&#039;s been moved it&#039;s not far and it&#039;s yellow+white ATM machine or you can do a grid seach for a DX exchange and you will be taken to somewhere inworld with a DX ATM,click the machine and look for a company called Virvox I wont garentee anything but I will say I trust them and have done business with them over the last 3 year&#039;s in Second Life so Virvox is a good company with atleast 3 year&#039;s trading they are NOT the scammer&#039;s this is also a good method to use if your trying to keep your BTC transaction&#039;s to yourself as the bank detail&#039;s will only show you paid Linden Lab&#039;s for the $L inworld currency,you will have a $250 per day limit for the first couple of month&#039;s but you can allway&#039;s contact them and ask for a Tier Limit Review to get the ammount raised I think the Highest limit with a free acount is $2,500 a day,I suppose you could use Second Life as laundry service if you wanted to i&#039;ve never thought about it that way untill now,and you never know you might even like Second Life.<br />Second Life Link.<br />http://secondlife.com/<br />If you use this method but are really having trouble finding an exchange machine IM me and I will meet you inworld and take you to 1,Please I do have a small little business I run from second life so please only ask for help if you really need it.
