				I&#039;ve been a member for well over a year now and I mostly just lurk on the forums and post rarely. I just now realized I can not do a simple reply to a post. Because of this I am now unable to post when I need to in any other discussions. Perhaps we could use a time variable instead? Anyone else have a different opinion or idea on this?

				This also prevents random people with good knowledge like postal workers or prosecutors who want to share it here from posting.

				I should also clarify that my SR account is older than a year but my forum account is only about 9 months since I started off lurking. Basically I just want to see what other people have as a possible solution to this problem. I see there are several good reasons for this new implementation; not only does it keep less informed persons from causing confusion by commenting in posts they do not understand, but it also helps to block the mtgix (and others) spambot issues. However on the other hand does anyone see that it actually creates an incentive to &quot;PLACE SPAM HERE TO GET TO 50&quot;? I am halfway tempted to just spam 50 posts just so I do not have to deal with this rule.<br /><br />The Silk Road is evidence that if people want illegal substances they will find a way to obtain those substances regardless. Ironically, on the same site we think that by making this rule people won&#039;t try to find a way around it.
