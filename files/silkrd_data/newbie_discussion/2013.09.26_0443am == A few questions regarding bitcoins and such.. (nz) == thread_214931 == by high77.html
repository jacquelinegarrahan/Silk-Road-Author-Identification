				Ok so I have been reading alot for the past few days trying to learn everything I need to know to safely make orders. From what I understand this is the basics:<br />-buy bitcoins from localbitcoin, coined, or bitinnovate<br />-transfer them to wallet such as blockchain<br />-transfer bicoins from the wallet directly to silk road using code on account page<br /><br />as far as ordering goes:<br />- obviously look for a vendor with good stealth and doesn&#039;t require fe<br />- use gpg4usb when contacting vendor, using their public key when you send them a message and giving them yours so they can do the same<br />stay in escrow and release funds as soon as product is recieved<br /><br />Is this pretty much accurate or is their something important missing? <br /><br />A couple of things im not sure about:<br />-Should I do all bitcoin related things on tor? and never use normal browser?<br />-Is it safe to log into a new fake hotmail account on tor which has no personal details on it? (from what I understand its best to stay away from normal sites that you actually use)<br />- Is it a smart idea to pay for bitcoins with my bank account using a normal browser and tumble them using tor? (not really keen on meeting up with someone to pay cash if I don&#039;t have to)<br />- Am I supposed to download gpg4usb onto my desktop and install like a normal program? Or do I download it straight to a usb flashdrive?<br />- Is it necessary to put bitcoins through multiple wallets? Or can I just buy them, transfer to blockchain and then SR?<br />- When I look at currency converting sites it shows that 1 btc is about $156 nzd right now, but the sites I look at to buy them charge 170-180 why is that?<br /><br />and finally does anyone know of good sites for nz&#039;ers to buy btc? The ones I listed up the top seem legit to me.<br /><br />I feel like I have the very basics but not enough knowledge to try a purchase yet. Any help is HUGELY appreciated!<br />

				Localbitcoin and coined are both good, they are what I use.<br />Looking for a vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE? outside of the very few (and very expensive) local vendors most I&#039;ve looked at require FE for NZ, and a great many simply say they do not deliver here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had 1 international order that they kept in escrow, 4 or 5 smallish ones I FE for, and one I FE&#039;d for just as that vendor stole everyone&#039;s coins.<br />personally I havn&#039;t been to worried about bouncing coins around lots of wallets, but then it&#039;s pretty small time personal stuff I&#039;ve ever ordered.<br />And the currency conversion is way off.

				Thanks for the info, do you pay meet someone and pay in cash for your bitcoins? And have you recieved all your international orders so far? I understand its good to stay clear of ordering from Netherlands, Belgium, most of europe.. im thinking UK and USA vendors are best.

				Aside from the 1 scam, all have made it, I&#039;m not too sure why everyone is so scared of shipping here? UK and USA so far, all been a week to a week and a half.&nbsp; I&#039;d add Canada should be safe, maybe France I&#039;d assume, but never from Netherlands etc.<br />I&#039;ve always used online banking for localbitcoins and coined.

				Nah, Bitcoins themselves are not illegal, though what else there is to spend on them I don&#039;t know...<br />Besides most vendors not shipping here, SR does leave you spending alot of time deciding what you want to try, all we have readily available is weed and meth in NZ

				Ok im in oz but every order of mine from the netherlands has made it through so if you&#039;re not sure dont say as there are alot of good vendors in every country <br /><br />checkout coinjar.io thats who i get my btc from and they are quick and cheap<br /><br />then I send them to a blockchain wallet just like you said and then on send them to SR all the methods have been done on the clearnet using a vpn where suitable <br /><br />Yeah vendor with good stats make sure to read the feedback incase they have 5/5 never arrived etc and also search the forums <br /><br />pgp any sensitive info dont pgp every msg just ones that can lead to who you are <br /><br />Stay in escrow dont FE and if you do dont whine if you get ripped off <br /><br />alot of people say you cant use hotmail or gmail from tor i have used a fake one i set up through tor but if you set it up on the clearnet dont access it through tor <br /><br />I pay for minne with cash at the bank thern always tumble them before sending to the tor network (reasonable doubt)<br /><br />You can have pgp anywhere but remember if your computer is seized they have your keys and can decrypt anything you still have look into TAILS thats next<br /><br />No tumbleing them through blockchain is fine <br /><br />Because its like the stock market if they sold at what they were worth by the time the transactiion was done they could be worth more/less pluss they add on a commission

				cryngie,<br />&nbsp;you state that tumbling your bc,s is good. You mean when you purchase them from localbitcoin or somewhere else you send them to yet another wallet before sending them to SR? I have not done this but I do always change my wallet address at sr each time before I transfer. Thoughts? <br /><br />the hotmail thing I have covered. set up via tor and only use via tor. its actually outlook but same thing. I havent seen blockchain info. Can you enlighten me on this?

				OK a tumbler is where say you have 1btc in your wallet, it sends that 1btc in random amounts in multiple transactions to break it up then all back into your wallet, it makes that 1btc virtually untraceable <br /><br />Changing your wallet addy everytime is good I do this also but itt is not tumbling, if you buy a btc with your account or even a cash deposit at a bank that transfer can be traced if they wanted to but if tumbled makes it very very hard to trace.

				ok got&nbsp; it. Missed that part. Ugh. Although I have no real name etc I use on email etc and just do cash deposit at bank anonymously to purchase bc. well guess you live an learn.&nbsp; A newbie needs to write out instructions for other newbies so they can put directions in more simple terms as opposed to someone trying to explain things in terms that have been around a while. Or perhaps some of us should just read more carefully&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Thanks Cryngie<br /><br />
