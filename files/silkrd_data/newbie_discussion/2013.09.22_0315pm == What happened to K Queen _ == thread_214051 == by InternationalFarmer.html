				&nbsp;Hello mates,<br /><br />I, like other buyers here, FE for international order has K Queen requested. Never received and now on his page is written &quot;R.I.P&quot;<br /><br />Did something bad happened ? Arrested or something like that <br /><br />We didn&#039;t stay in ESCROW by accepting the FE, but lot of people (maybe) have been scammed. <br />So is there a way to get the bitcoins back from his account ?<br /><br />Hope this is just a matter of time does she respond and reship / refund ...

				In the &quot;user discussion&quot; K Queen said :<br /><br />&quot;Farewell to you all. It has been a pleasure to work with you. Unfortuantely things took a turn for the worse in the last few weeks. As a result we are leaving this wonderful community.<br /><br />All messages will not be responded to, and we have informed vendor support to refund all orders in escrow.<br /><br />Goodbye and God Bless<br /><br />HRH<br /><br />K Queen&quot;<br /><br />So everybody who FE will be scammed.

				he turned scammer, or sold his account to a scammer. <br /><br />i did FE because he asked fr that in the past... good strategy.<br /><br />the only way to not be scammed in the future is NEVER FE with nobody.<br /><br />(if you have good stats, of course.)

				to be fair vendors are folk just like the rest of us, sometime shit goes bad, accidents, sickness death etc. the nature of the work makes it harder to work notice like in the real world and the fairwell message seems to be a lot more than most scammers give.<br /><br />&nbsp;its unfortunate there is an fe issue here but it doesnt immediatly mean a scam.<br /><br />just saying.

				Damn!!!!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking forward to my 2g of K for 2 weeks now and now I know that it&#039;s gone forever. Perculiar thing with my order is that I actually put in an order prior to his new FE for all international orders rule and my order was cancelled the next day. I was perplexed so I started to dig around and saw that he changed or created this rule just after I made my order.&nbsp; BUT because of reading nothing but stellar reviews I threw caution to the wind and went ahead and reordered and FEd this time.<br />Hopefully this will be a good lesson for a lot of us who were dumb enough to FE.<br />What an asshat!

				K Queen stated to ask a lot of buyers to FE, they clearly had no intention of filling those orders and pulled an FE exit scam which is the oldest trick in the book.<br /><br />If you ever get asked to FE say FU!<br /><br />escrow is there for a reason, it&#039;ll save you getting scammed in most circumstances.
