				I&#039;m sure it all depends on the gamer, but I&#039;d say weed is my favorite while gaming. I use coke occasionally, but not a lot. Just enough to get me wired for a bit if I&#039;m doing an all nighter or something.

				Ganja with ur choice of alcohol be it beer, vodka, rum,&nbsp; etc. i dont get drunk just a buzz then i smoke to intesify everything else. I dont mess with Blow so i cant give an opinion of it but i do know that mdma is a waste. I strongly believe its a social drug not meant to be done alone. i have yet to game with a group of friends and do mdma though. last ive tried with lsd and shrooms but it only possible on the come up for me then shit gets TOO REAL lolz and then im unable to even play. I can still play just not well. So if your trying to have maximum fun i say experiment, but if your trying to get in the zone i recommend bomb ass ganja with enough drink to get buzzed.

				Gaming is insanely fun on ecstasy, albeit everything is insanely fun on ecstasy. Just make sure the OST is good, there&#039;s lots of loud noise, or you have other music playing. Silence is the one thing that&#039;s not fun on MDMA.

				For me it is all based on the experience, if I want to struggle and maybe spice up a very visual trip I may just try and play any game. Things get very interesting very fast, sometimes the game kind of disappears. Smoking bud slows me down and causes me to lose at any multiplayer game, it also makes ordinary moments seem amazing so I don&#039;t mind getting rolled every now and again.

				Weed is at the top of my list but I had the most intense time on shrooms. <br /><br />I was playing COD MW3 and it was a small map, everyone was teleporting around and dying left and right. I swear there were a 1000 care packages falling from the sky and killstreaks galore. I feel like I wasn&#039;t the only one witnessing this and it had to be happening because of the amazing amount of care packages lying around and people picking them up. It almost seemed like I couldn&#039;t be killed and got the drop on everyone, also posted a pretty awesome score.<br /><br />

				Mushrooms or PCP. Mushrooms makes games so beautiful and immersive. Great for Halo, Elder Scrolls, etc. One time I smoked PCP-laced weed (lol, it DOES exist) and played an amazing game of counter-strike. Weird in-the-zone feeling, felt like part of the game.

				I&#039;ll always recommend acid just cause everything is moving (obviously) so I mean your game might appear warped. I just played a bunch of Super Mario this past weekend while I was on acid and it was pretty funny trying to concentrate on the screen. But personally I feel the best one has gotta be Ecstasy just simply because the fact that your eyes are so sensitive to light, all the colors just blow your mind.&nbsp; I actually find it difficult to play crazy games on X cause it&#039;s so intense. I even get lost in the changing background that plays on my PS3 when listening to music. X is seriously just the best drug for nearly everything visual that you control. I&#039;ll never stop recommending people to try it.

				Ketamine while playing skyrim is pretty interesting. I always get way too attached to my character and don&#039;t want him to get hurt so I spend most of my time running away from things but it does add an interesting new layer to the game.<br />Also any psychedelic and any game where you can drive a vehicle from the &quot;cockpit view&quot; is a lot of fun. It usually reminds me how bad of an idea driving while tripping is.
