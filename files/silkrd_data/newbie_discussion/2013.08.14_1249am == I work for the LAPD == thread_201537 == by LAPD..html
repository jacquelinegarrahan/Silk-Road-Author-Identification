				Hello. You can call me &quot;Rick&quot;. I am a 3rd rank officer in the LAPD Gang &amp; Narcotics Division. I have over 10 years of field experience and have conducted 2 Controlled Deliveries so far and arrested many individuals. <br /><br />I only support the law so far, but something has got to pay the bills. There are many times it would be a young man with only a small amount of oxy and we had to book him anyways. I don&#039;t like it, but I don&#039;t have a choice when other officers are around. <br /><br />Feel free to ask questions, I think I can answer most of them.

At least half of the money spent is from forfeitures and officers are usually rewarded for finding it. I am not sure if that is a monetary reward, or a case of donuts as I have never encountered such a situation. <br /><br />I can however tell you we would rather find cash than drugs when conducting a search. It is often better evidence than the drugs themselves.

				Why do you continue to act against your will? How do you feel knowing that you have no real control over your actions and if you do not preform a certain way you will be fired? Does it make a difference to you if a crime effects others or is it just another day and you have no connection with those you arrest? Do you find yourself looking at people to try and figure out what they are doing illegally? If so does that make you look down on the general public as a whole?<br /><br />Just some questions I have for you. I may ask more later.

We have no idea where the drugs are coming from, their intended purpose, and how it will affect the end users. A vast majority of the time, we find weapons in a housing location where cocaine and heroin are located, and that combination is not something I can turn a blind eye to. <br /><br />The drugs themselves are not that bad until you start getting into hard stuff, but it is the fact we always find them with violence, immigrants, and civilian disputes that keeps you going thinking you are doing the &quot;right thing&quot;. I have turned a blind eye before to a group of males using psychedelics and arrests for marijuana are getting more and more rare. <br /><br />I almost never instigate an arrest myself. If I see a banned substance I will probably do something about it, but I do not view the average person as likely to be a criminal or drug user.&nbsp; Being in the police department inherently gives you a bad view of controlled substances because of the demographics of where they come from, and the violent societies that are formed from them. Within the department officers usually express no emotion towards the drugs or the situation unless it gets really out of hand or extreme. <br /><br />I cannot take a picture of my badge because you can identify the county from it. I would basically have to remove the entire image. <br /><br />Hitch,<br />&nbsp;I enjoy that I determine how people are punished for their crimes. If a person clearly has no issues but was caught with marijuana then we have the power to let them go or just write a citation. I don&#039;t accept bribes, but I would be a very wealthy man if I did. <br /><br />The department does not have hiring signs on the windows so I don&#039;t really know. If you are well qualified you can get a job at numerous police departments. If you are just starting out, probably not. <br /><br />CMK2914, <br />I know that a higher percentage of the forfeitures goes to the specific division that found it, if not 90% of it. A couple of years ago we found a European riding around in a van with 3 kilograms of cocaine and $xx,xxx cash. The lead officer of the division gave several public statements and the officers on duty who found the cocaine went out drinking. There are end of the year bonuses for several things, including the total street value of drugs found on cases where you were present, number of illegal immigrants detained, and overtime hours worked, but I am not that knowledgeable on where the total money goes. <br /><br />Nearly all officers enjoy all aspects of the job, or at least aren&#039;t going around questioning the morals of such a system.

				What is your perspective of the Drug War? Especially the SWAT style tactics developed in your city to combat victimless crimes. We all know drugs are deleterious to ones physiology, but the government in my opinion, has zero authority to dictate what adults do to their bodies. And to your comment regarding guns being associated with illegal contraband.If the market was state controlled their would be no need for anyone to be armed. The violence involved within the drug trade is a direct product of their prohibition.

You can call me &quot;Rick&quot;. I am a 3rd rank officer in the LAPD Gang &amp; Narcotics Division. I have over 10 years of field experience and have conducted 2 Controlled Deliveries so far and arrested many individuals. <br /><br />I only support the law so far, but something has got to pay the bills. There are many times it would be a young man with only a small amount of oxy and we had to book him anyways. I don&#039;t like it, but I don&#039;t have a choice when other officers are around. <br /><br />Feel free to ask questions, I think I can answer most of them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi &quot;Rick&quot;,<br /><br />Just curious, in your department is Silk Road even an issue that LE are even worried about, or are they after street level deals mostly? Also, how can someone be prepared or foresee a controlled delivery if there were to be one. Adding to that question..what are the laws on controlled deliveries?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The department is aware drugs are sold on the internet, but that is viewed as one single term rather then dividing it up. We have no idea where the drugs are coming from other than the internet. Street deals are obviously 95%+ of what gets our attention. <br /><br />A controlled delivery will always be later than it should of been. To my understanding it is near impossible to do a controlled delivery on anything that arrives in less than 3 days. <br /><br />In the two instances where I was involved in a controlled delivery, we had two officers in a cruiser down the block, one in the mailman&#039;s car (a real one), and the mailman was an undercover officer. In my experience, the undercover cop will always be indiscreetly armed and in good physical shape. The usual mailman will be no where in sight because we cannot take the risk of you being armed. There can be 1 or multiple officers in his vehicle, so if you notice there are other individuals in the vehicle or something suspicious about it, that is a potential tip off. At least one cruiser must be legally present, and rarely will cruisers be parked in a residential area. <br /><br />The regulations we were told to follow is if the receiver does not sign for the package we cannot issue a search warrant unless there is other reasonable cause. If the package is signed for and the person is disabled, over the age of 65, or under the age of 12 in appearance, a peaceful search warrant will be issued which means we won&#039;t put you in cuffs or have 10 officers pointing guns at you. If there is nothing else in the residence, it is reported back and from there I do not know what happens.

The decision to make a controlled delivery comes in from a sorting facility usually in a different state and is given to the head of the department who controls the county in which the package is destined for. From there he has full authority to do anything. So no, I cannot conduct a CD by myself or even attempt it.

If you don&#039;t have a way to make income by the time you are 18-19, go to college. If you do, then don&#039;t waste your time. It comes down to the individual, not society. <br /><br />Marijuana is the most common drug by far. I don&#039;t understand your last statement. If you are caught with a small amount of marijuana then you will rarely even see the inside of a prison cell. If you kill someone, well I&#039;m sorry you did that.

				thanks LAPD, i heard it was an inside job, and somehow they both tie in together.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a thing that hurts me to see, the war on drugs go against youth, and its like every bit we try they try to take us down.<br /><br />And i mean the thing with Tupac and Biggie, is the whole way it went down. It seems murder is a quiet way to die by a gun, and with real shit going on like Trayvon Martin, it goes to show we haven&#039;t changed much since the 90&#039;s
