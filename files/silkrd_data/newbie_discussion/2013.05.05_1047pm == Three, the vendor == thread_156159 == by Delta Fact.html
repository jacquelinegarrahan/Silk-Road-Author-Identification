				Hey there, this is a thread where I will post any product offerings or whatever until I am no longer newbie status on these forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, here we can exchange jokes and funny pictures and stuff. I enjoy talking about women, sex, and general chaos. <br /><br />:::<br /><br />Big question; why do white men always want asian women?

				This is an argument that I&#039;ve had with significant others and the fact is that Asian women aren&#039;t all that.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, an Asian girl can look amazing when dressed up accordingly, but so can most any girl.<br /><br />There is way more to this, but probably not important.&nbsp;

				Yeah, right!? Exactly. That&#039;s the thing that we ALLLL know, but the fact remains. <br /><br />White men flock to the women from the far east. I don&#039;t know if there is research to support this, but I swear it&#039;s gotta hold up. <br /><br />What is it about the asian chicks that keeps the white man coming??<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I honestly believe that for those men that do, a large portion of it is that they take pride in being a bride.&nbsp; And a lot of guys actually like that.&nbsp; Submission isn&#039;t the right word.&nbsp; But it falls along those lines.&nbsp;

				Cerealbox, I like the science there.&nbsp; You&#039;re bringing in a whole new dimension, one that may lead back to the free will question and that experiment (detailed in the book &quot;The Illusion of Free Will&quot;) in which the researchers, through brain scans, found that the choice a test subject would make was already chosen before she was aware of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />But anyway, I think white guys like Asian women, if in fact they do, because white society is super masculine, and yet, at the same time, super emasculating.&nbsp; (I&#039;m thinking of white middle-class society that says fighting is wrong, working with your hands is not cool, and taking care of your own business is frowned upon when you could have a police state to do it for you.)&nbsp; So being with an Asian woman may help these white guys feel a little more masculine, because white society sees Asian women as super-feminine.&nbsp; White society perceives them as smaller and more &quot;docile,&quot; and that they make you feel like a Real Man, ARGHHHHHHH.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

The fact that the women &quot;hold the cards&quot; seems to make sense. I read some data OkCupid released regarding gender disparity in identifying attractiveness. In that study, women tended to grade most men as zero (not attractive) and a few men as fives; but with almost no mid range selections. Men, on the other hand, graded a majority of women in the mid range. This would imply that women were very particular and men are much more open to a variety of appearances. <br /><br />Kinda makes sense because I find myself often saying &quot;yeah, I&#039;d bang her&quot;. Whereas most women are more particular in their selections.
