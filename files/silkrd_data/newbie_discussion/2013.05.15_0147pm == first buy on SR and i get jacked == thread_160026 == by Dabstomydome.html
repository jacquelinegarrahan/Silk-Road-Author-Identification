				So last week tuesday i made my first order on silk road and i ordered 15 cheeba chews and 3.5 grams of honeycomb. I ordered from the top shelf because he had both cheeba chews and wax which is what i wanted so i figured go through him and get it all in one package. i was a little reluctant to FE but he had such good rating and reviews that i thought id take the chance. i really didnt think it was a possibility of him running off with my $400 at the time. Well he said the package was supposed to come last saturday and now i see that he jacked everyone. When i saw the beware of the top shelf thread, my heart sunk and i knew i was fucked. i know theres nothing i can do about it now and please dont tell me &quot;dont FE&quot; cuz i already know and i learned my lesson. just wanted to let off some steam. i was so stoked to get my first package and it ends up being a fucking bust and now I dont even know if i want to chance my money with this shit anymore. oh and fuck you the top shelf you slimy little bitch, you might be able to jack people on the internet but one day you will get yours and karma will fuck your little bitch ass!

				Really sorry to hear that happened to you mate, particularly on your first buy....I know it&#039;s something that can so easily happen particularly (tho not solely) to us noobs.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have more success from here on in and also hopefully what goes around comes around and the person who scammed gets f*cked over by someone else as they deserve.<br /><br />

				ah that sucks, man! I feel with ya. haven&#039;t made my first order yet, looking for a vendor with good ratings that doesn&#039;t require FE. after reading so many stories like yours, there&#039;s no way I&#039;m gonna FE until I really get to know a seller....

I know how it feels to get ripped off and it does not feel good.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t ripped off by a vendor, but I lost $50.00 when I made my first deposit. All my own fault. So now you can bet that I know the official SR address both frontward and backward by heart! Also after that, my policy is to never FE. Never.&nbsp; That includes with vendors I might have bought from hundreds of times. The best policy is to use the rules that are in place to protect us and the vendors and to never...not ever...FE.&nbsp; Never.

				omg why did you finalize early???? in every second post on this forum some dude warns you about this!!!!<br /><br />ahhh sry just joking&nbsp; :D 400$ is a lot of money, sry for that bro! but you have to see the positive things about this! At least you will never ever finalize early again (well i hope for you&nbsp; :P) AND it would be worse if your first order got seized by LE and your home address would be flagged. <br /><br />

				I, too, was scammed in my first transaction. It was before I&#039;d every discovered the forums and it seemed like everybody and their uncle was finalizing early. BUT since then I&#039;ve had a bunch of very good experiences - including multiple vendors sending out shipments even when SR was down, just trusting they&#039;d get their money from me eventually. Really restored my faith in the system and I hope you have some good times coming to you.

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about that. Just getting the BTC into an account is a hassle then finding a vendor, then getting ripped off by some loser. I know what it&#039;s like to be robbed...it happened to me in a parking lot on a rainy night and I&#039;ll never forget it, they got a half pound.&nbsp; <br />BUT don&#039;t forget that there are real people out here, that actually DO send product as described. That don&#039;t ask you to pay up front, that package the items so everyone is safe.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				thanks guys for all the support. and thank you chinacat for the gift, that was really nice of you. i know 99% of the people on this site are good, i just had the shitty luck of choosing the wrong 1%. crazy bad luck but thats life i guess. just shows whether it is real life or internet, never front your money if you cant chance losing it. anyone know of vendors i can get good edibles or wax from? let me know so i dont make the same mistake twice. thanks everyone!

				Ouch! That&#039;s a lot of money to drop on your first purchase, very brave of you...<br /><br />I bought small samples from several vendors so a) I didn&#039;t lose too much money b) I could get my stats up and try out the products and the vendors before I started buying snow leopards.<br /><br /><br />Sorry to hear you got ripped off man, give it another go but start smaller this time eh!?

				2nd buy I got done.&nbsp; FE&#039;d on my first it came through good.&nbsp; FE&#039;d on my 2nd with another newish vendor and he scammed me.&nbsp; Claimed to have sent the package twice to me, but it never arrived.&nbsp; All my messages were fairly polite, but he was being rude and offensive, so I guess thats a bad sign!&nbsp; ...now I&#039;ve got going a bit more, there are plenty of established vendors and even new ones not asking for FE, and they have all worked out great!

				What about his stats?<br />I mean... if there are so many scammers on SR how is it possible they are able to stell goods to people?<br /><br />Don&#039;t they have like shitty stats and bad reviews?<br />Aren&#039;t they on a black list or such?

				Well, I can endorse NorCalKing (NCK) as an awesome guy to buy weed from the first time. He was my first vendor and I just messaged him before ordering and I didn&#039;t have to FE. Got it in 3 days from the order and was perfect. Just in case you wanted a specific name to check in on yourself (search forum posts and stuff on a vendor before ordering from em)
