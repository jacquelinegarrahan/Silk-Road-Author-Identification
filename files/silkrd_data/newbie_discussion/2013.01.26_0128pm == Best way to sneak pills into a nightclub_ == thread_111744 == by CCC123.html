				Hello,<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way to get pills into a club? In case you are searched etc... and have say 5 pills. Also if you are doing Es is it likely that the bouncers/staff will see that you are on drugs and kick you out?<br /><br />Thanks<br />C

				It really depends on the place. If you are familiar with the place and know how they search, light, heavy etc. The places I frequent aren&#039;t too hard on the door, so hiding them deep in a pocket works fine, but if the searches are more invasive (i.e. crotch grabbing, hard pocket search etc.)&nbsp; I usually stick the gear in my sock/shoe. If you are going to a techno club no one will notice and there will be lots of people more fucked up than you are.<br /><br />tl,dr: Know your venue

				The &quot;drop sack&quot; is a useful trick to learn for this and many other situations. You take a sunglasses bag/earbud case, the kind of thin, felt-lie, fabric bags with drawstrings, wrap the end of the drawstrings around your jeans&#039; button so it can dangle from the button when let go of. After ensuring the drawstrings are securely fasten to your waist button, you button up them pants, put on a belt to further disguise the drawstrings, and put it up and over your waistband down into your pants where it will dangle between your legs about around your junk. Not many macho men bouncers (or even cops) are going to want to grab your junk during a search at a show. So as long as its properly hidden between your legs and there is no visible bulge, you should be just fine.&nbsp;

				What dipset said. I&#039;ve been to many clubs where searches were more invasive than airport security; full pat-downs, shoes and socks off etc, and a bag behind your nutsack is not going to get found.<br /><br />On a completely different note, this is my 50th post and I&#039;ve got here by contributing rather than spamming. You&#039;ll find me lurking in the security forum from now on.

				5 pills in your pocket should be fine<br /><br />Back in the day we always thought it was cool to bring our tokemaster into the spectrum by dumping out a bag of pretzels, putting the bong in and then giving the bag to our dumbest friend to carry in plain sight right into the concert. Sigh those were the days

				Cut a small slit in the elastic lining of your boxers and you can slide as many as you need to inside the lining and all along the waist-rim.<br /><br />Keeping them in pre-arranged amounts in separate baggies is generally a bad idea as, should you get caught, you are far less likely to defend an intent to supply charge.<br /><br />

				Bros: Compression shorts. Pretty much makes your entire pelvic area a vacuum seal.<br /><br />Girls: In the underwear. Panties &gt; bras. Some butchy bouncer broad somehow found 1g of coke in my friend&#039;s bra but that&#039;s very uncommon.<br /><br />Boiz: Just throw em in the banana hammock. If the bouncer checks too thoroughly chances are he&#039;s looking for something else&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />No-no&#039;s:<br />Bags/purses/clutches - should be a no-brainer<br />Shoes/socks - As if no one is going to notice you taking off your shoes in a nightclub. Higher-end spots (ie. Meatpacking district) have plain-clothed security in spots like the bathrooms.<br />Pockets - another no-brainer<br />Mouth - sounds ridiculous but I have seen people try it<br />Hat - Probably going to be harder to get the hat in than the drugs<br /><br />Other OK spots:<br />Men&#039;s wallets <br />Cell phone cases<br />Necklaces (you can buy ones with hidden compartments. think cruel intentions)<br />Cigarette Packs<br />

				I always stuck them on the inside of my cell phone case. And I&#039;ve never seen a bouncer kick someone out for rolling. 50% of good clubs are rolling it seems like. They just don&#039;t like drugs on their property, because its a legal liability. Once you&#039;ve taken them, then its past that point, and they really can&#039;t do much.

It not only works well but it is also very versatile, it can obviously hold much more than just pills. <br /><br />I do have an idea... If you have very few pills, then I bet you could just stick it in your bellybutton and tape it over. :). Posts who talk about wallets not being checked by bouncers, the same trend is common in my country so it is relatively safe I would say to store small volume drugs in there, particularly pills. <br /><br />Entity<br /><br /><br />Entity

				Seriously though, put them in a little dime baggie and stuff it between your nutsack and your leg in the corner. That way when you spread your legs if you&#039;re getting searched invasively, it&#039;ll stick and there is no way in hell anyone who searches you is going to be cupping your nutsack.

				If you&#039;re a lady, we&#039;ve seen ppl succeed by wearing a bra with a wire support in it.&nbsp; Just put each pill under the wire (encased in fabric), and even if a female bouncer for some reason were to grab your boobs outright they still wouldn&#039;t feel the pills.<br /><br />For non-perverted lesbian bouncer pat-down&#039;s though it&#039;s even less likely that they&#039;ll ever know there&#039;s something on the backside of the wire (the side of the material that&#039;s touching your boobs).<br /><br />If you&#039;re not modest you could prolly make a few extra bucks per pill by showing your client&#039;s in the club your boobs :D
