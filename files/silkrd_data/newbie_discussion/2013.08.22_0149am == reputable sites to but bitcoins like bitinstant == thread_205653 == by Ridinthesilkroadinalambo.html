				So i used to use bitinstant and then send the funds via moneygram to blockchain and transfer the funds from blockchain to SR. Worked beautifully up until about a month and a half ago when bitinstant suspended their services indefinently! So while im aware that there are a number of ways to buy btc, using the moneygram method which put the funds in my blockchain wallet is what i&#039;m most comfortable with.So does anyone know of any sites that i can do pretty much the same method? i&#039;m really gettin tired with hunting down my old weed connects cuz i just moved and SR is my saving grace but i really need a reputable site that i can buy BTC with moneygram like i always did! Thanx!

				Localbitcoins is all you need, period. You can buy BTC totally anonymously via cash deposits to anonymous bank accounts, western union, etc. as well as payment sites like dwolla, okpay, paypal. There are many different sellers offering coin for quite a lot less than market, and I&#039;ve found most release payment within a few minutes. Beats the shit out of waiting god knows how long for bitinstant or whatever exchange to process your transaction! It seems risky at first but I have never had an issue and haven&#039;t heard of any either.

				how do you make cash deposits into bank accounts? i never understood this, do you just go to their bank and ask to put the cash in that specific account? do you write some sort of check? deposit slip? I just cant find an answer to this question.

				You answered your own question, yes. The seller will give you the details and you just go to their bank, fillout a deposit slip with the acct # and hand over the cash. No questions, no names, simple as that. Takes a lot of faith the first time! Maybe start small until you feel secure.
