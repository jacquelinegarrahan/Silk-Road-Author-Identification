				It&#039;s sad that people can&#039;t take a good thing and make the best out of it.<br /><br />So many people scamming people out of bitcoins and so many vendors scamming people.... it makes it a lot less fun and makes the longevity of something so sweet a lot more short-lived.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who has done &quot;the right thing&quot; <br /><br />&lt;/rant&gt;

				Make sure if you get scammed you relay that information in the forums. Research is how we protect ourselves from lying scumbag vendors and it is only going to work if we warn each other and post reviews. You need to get your post count to 50 then you can review vendors in the rumor mill forum. I&#039;m working on getting there now as i have a couple deliveries I have doubts on at this point. The key remember is research research research.

				There&#039;s always going to be some greedy assholes fucking shit up but there&#039;s a lot of really good vendors on the road too. You just have to find them.

				I also think it is really gay about the 50 post minium for members like myself. I&#039;ve been a member of the forum and SR under the same name for 1.5 years. I normally just post reviews or questions and do not order alot but over time i spent alot here. I was always able to post until recently when they made this 50 post min. so now i have to play the post game. BS

				Still a ways away from 50 posts myself.<br /><br />My first experience (25 BTC order) went perfect. My second one (also large transaction, different vendor, different item) has not arrived. It was supposed to yesterday, then I messaged vendor, he said it didn&#039;t go out till yesterday (express) and today the mail came and it&#039;s not here. I may be jumping to conclusions but I found a negative thread on the vendor in the forums now (should&#039;ve searched first) and looks like we may be SOL. And of course, without knowing, I finalized early (did it last transaction and the guy came through)<br /><br />Does anyone have a solid connect for 5 pounds of greenery on the &#039;road?<br /><br />Thanks... hope this package makes it :(
