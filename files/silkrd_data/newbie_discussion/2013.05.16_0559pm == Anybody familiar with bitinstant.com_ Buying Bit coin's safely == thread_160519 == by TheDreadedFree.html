				Here&#039;s what I did, as it&#039;s quite fast and decently secure.<br /><br />I use bitinstant to buy bitcoins for an account I have on coinbase.com. You can buy bitcoins directly from Coinbase, but it takes forever (week+) if they&#039;re even selling at the time. With bitinstant, I just choose to send from case to my current Coinbase address (which I change after ever transaction). I use all my real personal info for this. The btc usually come in and are ready to be moved again within an hour of buying them from bitinstant, at which point I transfer them to my fresh SR btc address, and change both address after that transaction (which takes about another hour). In my opinion this is the best way to do it. You can add a buffer account or two between your real name coinbase and SR account, though it&#039;s really not needed, and each jump will take another hourish (how long coinbase lets a transaction sit before confirming it, in case you want/need to cancel it).

				there are a lot of topics covering this in the forums already. i have used bitinstant many times totally successfully. use fake info, name, phone, etc. then when you fill out the form or use the phone at the moneygram use the same fake info. have it sent to either your sr account or something like a bitstamp account, then sr. once you do it a couple times you&#039;ll feel more comfortable with it.

				Hi, I&#039;ve used bit-instant twice to pay direct to my account in S R.; I pay for the bitcoins by cash withdrawn from my acc. via a local money cashier: that way no need to pay with my cc and be identified.<br /><br />Both times, worked beautifully; had bitcoins in my SR account by an hour or two, make purchases straight away.<br /><br />Shame this option isn&#039;t available in the UK :-(<br />

				I used bitinstant for my first bitcoin purchase as well (I had a lot of the same concerns as you)... so I&#039;ll walk you through what all went down. The internet stuff is pretty straightforward (fake email, fake name, etc.)... I just asked bitinstant to let me pay for my bitcoins at a local Wal Mart and asked that the coins be sent to my fake email. I went to Wal Mart, paid (they didn&#039;t ask for ID), I went home... this is where hiccups began. After you&#039;re done with bitinstant a site called Coinapult should send an email where you can access your bitcoins and forward them to your SR wallet (that didn&#039;t happen). I had to bitch to bitinstant until they got in contact with coinapult (who doesn&#039;t respond quickly), and finally that got resolved and my email came through. After that, I sent the coins to my SR wallet (thinking it would be instant, dumbly)... that took about three hours (of me spazzing out and pressing refresh every two seconds).... but the coins finally appeared and I made my first purchase from deluxedelivery. Theoretically, unless LEO wants to go back and look at Wal Mart&#039;s tapes and watch me pay for the bitcoins, I should be anonymous. While the process wasn&#039;t bump-free, I&#039;m convinced everyone involved is reputable, not there to rip you off. Just give it a shot. I&#039;m still waiting on my first order (actually, I&#039;m still waiting for it to go from processing to in transit.... two days now)... but as long as that works out the entire process will have been a success! Good luck to you!

				Not true- moneygram charges 3.95 by themselves for the service. Bitinstant charges 3.99% ON TOP of that for making the exchange. So... say you&#039;re adding $50. 4% of $50 = $2 + $3.95 (moneygram) = $5.95.... that&#039;s over 10%. Six bucks might not sound like much, but for a transaction of.. .say.... $500... you&#039;re looking at 23.95. Not a HUGE amount of money, but it&#039;s not negligible either. As I recall zipzap may have had a fee in there as well... it ended up being way more than I wanted to pay.

				This just seams like a bit of a pain! especially when i&#039;m going to have to do three diposites due to the 500$ limit,&nbsp; Maybe having an unconnected friend buy the coins from coin base then wash them and send them to SR?&nbsp; coinbase almost take nothing and there is no limit of how many you can buy...Any thoughts?<br />

				You can use bitinstant pretty anonymously if you want to. You can always just deposit cash at a local money gram location. Use a fake name, get a fake address ready(apt building in the city you are depositing), Think up a fake phone number and have all it memorized or ready to give. Create tormail account specifically for that fake name so you can receive email confirmation in case any problems occur you can still recover money. Make sure you save every bit of info they give you for your receipt just in case. Walk into mom and pop money gram agent and hand them the cash an the money will be in your SR account within the hour. If you are worried about sending it straight to your account you can always mix it through a couple wallets. Just make sure you add enough extra money for extra fees if you want to wash your bitcoins through different wallets. PM me if you need more in detail info.

				Just my 2 cents. Using bitinstant at walmart seems to be pretty easy. I use the cash payment to BTC address/ SR wallet. Grab the blue moneygram forms and have it filled out when you get up to the CS counter. If it&#039;s your first time they are going to input the information into their system. After that first time you just give the telephone number you first used and the info is brought up at the counter. Takes 2 minutes. I just happened to get a nosy clerk who asked me &quot;zipzap inc. what&#039;s that? &quot; She never heard of it. Told her it&#039;s a bill payment service. (nosy ass...) BTC was in my wallet 90 min. later. Use your real name or a fake. They don&#039;t ask for ID. Seems like the best method to me so far. But what the hell do I know... 8)

				I use bitinstant and love it. IF you select to pay with cash at walmart it will transfer you to zip zap. Zip Zap sends you an email with info to &quot;pay your bill&quot; with a special #. Bring this to walmart. Fill out Money gram. Pay, bit coins show up in provided BC address within 2 hours in my experience. I tried using a fake name to pay. Did not work. Cash register lady said the name I put on Money Gram had to match the name on my debit card. I suppose this wouldnt be an issue if you paid using cash at walmart. I have not been charged by walmart to use moneygram. Maybe zipzap has a deal with them? Bit instant does charge and so does zipzap. ZipZap I think is a flat 3.95. Bit instant is a small percentage which can add up if you spending hundreds. But you gotta do what you gotta do! :) <br />I like using Bit Instant. Fast and very easy. IMO. :D

				Im no safety pro but I use bitinstant in a regular browser, not TOR. If your at the zipzap payment slip then yes, it does ask you to DL a ticket or payment slip. You dont have to DL it tho bc it will be sent to your email also. I just pull up the email at walmart to get the info I need. I dont print it out or write it down or down load it! :) Hope that helps. It wasn&#039;t easy figuring it out at first but once you do its a breeze. Just keep working at it! :) Good luck!

				I recently used bitinstant for the first time a few days ago, and it was ridiculously easy and fast - my coins were sent within 10 minutes, maybe a little less.&nbsp; The slowest part of the process was waiting for them to show up in my SR account, which took around 3 hours.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to pay any MoneyGram fees, just the ZipZap charge and the 4% hit from bitinstant.
