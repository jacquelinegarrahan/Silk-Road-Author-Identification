				Ecstasy pills cost about 0.15 a piece, which equals to about 1.5 bitcoins for 1 gram.&nbsp; MDMA crystals/powder only costs about ~.60 bitcoins.&nbsp; Just wondering why that is.&nbsp; You&#039;d think it&#039;d be the other way around, if anything.

				MY assumption is that they would be easier to sell in a rave or club like setting. People in that type of environment would rather buy a stamped pill than a random crystal in a capsule or powder being sold as MDMA.

				Well someone makes them so there are likely added labor costs. There is also a higher interception rate so that is likely part of the equation.&nbsp; Those are my best guesses.

				I think it&#039;s because it represents more work to press pills and the equipment costs also.<br />Maybe they&#039;re not pressed by the MDMA manufacturers themselves, so it makes more people in the chain.<br />I don&#039;t know for sure, but it&#039;s just like food: the closer it is to be ready to be consumed, the more you will pay for it.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />Don&#039;t know about you guys, but the people i know and me are a lot more likely to buy a capsule with crystals in it than a pressed pill that could have almost anything in it. People who press pills do it for the money so they might be reckless.

				To have pills you need MDMA plus a pill press plus binders plus the extra handling and measuring the right ratio to make the right dosage pills and it would be much more time and work to produce. If you can produce MDMA and sell it in its pure form you are saving yourself all that time and trouble. Pills are more marketable like the post above says. You can easily pass some one a pill and drop it in the space of a few seconds. Powder needs more delicate handling and the shit can spill everywhere if you were at a club or a party. I think the cost comes back to production. A pill press if you can get one wont be cheap.
