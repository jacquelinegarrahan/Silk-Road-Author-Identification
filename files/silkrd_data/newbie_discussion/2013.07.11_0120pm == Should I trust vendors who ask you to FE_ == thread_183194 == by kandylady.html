				Another penny for your thoughts. I broke my rule of no trading moneypak for bitcoin with a vendor i&#039;ve never dealt with. I got it after about 18 hours, but holy shit, i think i lost 5 years off of my life from the stress and nerves of waiting. &quot;Did I get fucked or did i not&quot;was running around in my head the whole time! Lol. Never again! Lol

				Stay positive till you know. And update too. If you like valium hit up mdpro. Bought several times from him(not valium though). He&#039;s fast, and has great communication. He was my first buy. Doesn&#039;t require fe. Is your order marked in transit, or still processing? When did you place order?

				In my opinion,it&#039;s understandable for a vendor to ask you to FE if your stats are low.. A Buyer can scam a Vendor just as easily as a Vendor can scam a Buyer. But once stats are in a good range, never FE. If a buyer requires you to FE after u have made a few purchases with no problems, find someone else.....

				It&#039;s a matter of trust. If you do your research about the vendor who asked you to FE and you find out that he&#039;s trusted and loved... I don&#039;t think finalizing early is that much of a trouble. I&#039;ve finalized early a couple of times out of 10 orders and haven&#039;t had a problem, but obviously the ideal scenario is to be able to stay in escrow. Just think by yourself and don&#039;t set hermetic rules.

Hence, no peace of mind that comes along with knowing if you got scammed you can take it to resolution. The scammers do come from both vendors and buyers, but if you don&#039;t wanna fe you don&#039;t have to. There are vendors that don&#039;t require it.

				People won&#039;t quit FE&#039;ing. Its a fact of life and seems like its here to stay on SR. New people with no past transactions are usally the ones asked to FE the most. Here are some basic tips. I have been buying on the road for several months, and only recently started selling. In this time I have been scammed ZERO times. I don&#039;t FE. <br /><br />1. Don&#039;t FE for large amounts. This should be common sense.<br />2. Check the feedback. See a string of &quot;fe&quot; comments you should run away, far, far away.<br />3. If the deal is too good to be true, thats because it is.

				Personally i think if you do your research and use your common sense it can be ok to FE certain vendors who ask for it.A couple of my favorite vendor&#039;s ask for FE no matter what your stats are and i&#039;ve never had a problem even had a no show and received full reship.<br />Please bare in mind these are some of the bigger vendors about but it&#039;s why i think saying &quot;never FE to anyone&quot; limits you unnecessarily sometimes.

If there page states all users must FE then do research on that vendor (search their name in forums or read their review page if they have one and the feedback on their profile). One of my favourite vendors asks everyone to FE and I&#039;ve never had a problem so a FE policy isn&#039;t always bad. But don&#039;t expect a refund whether or not they seem trustworthy because a FE policy usually means no refunds.

				I&#039;ve done a couple of FE, but the sellers had high and good rep, and only after i first spoke with them via private message. because i am new they required FE. and i would only do it for small amounts. so far i&#039;ve had no problem. best to go by your gut instinct after you speak to the person.

				Why FE? There are plenty of vendors who do not require it, in fact ask you not to. New vendors are not even allowed to accept FE.

				It would seem to depend on the feedback, including the recent feedback, about the item you want to purchase.&nbsp; Is their more than 4 or 5 good recent transactions on that item.&nbsp; Does the vendor tell you the specifics of the processing and delivery time?&nbsp; Then yes, I would finalize early.
