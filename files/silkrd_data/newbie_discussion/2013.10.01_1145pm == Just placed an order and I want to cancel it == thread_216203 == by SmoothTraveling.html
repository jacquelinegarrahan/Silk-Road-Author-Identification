				Is there a way to do this? The order was just placed and the item is not in transit. The product requires FE and I am not willing to do so. I am concerned that the vendor may not cancel it for me.

				Who is the vendor?? Are you cancelling purely because you don&#039;t want to FE?? Thats a good policy, but, some vendors can be trusted with an FE and if you really want the product it might be worth doing it. Bcpltd requires FE for example and I&#039;ve used him a bunch o times, after the 1st order, I&#039;ve never hesitated to FE.

Terribly short term memory.<br /><br />I&#039;d prefer to not say the vendors name at this time. A review popped up just after I placed my order saying that the item was marquis tested and did not test as it should. I would FE for a more reputable vendor, but this person is fairly new and after seeing that review I am not willing to pay someone for bunk product.
