				Well, I do know, there will be only one way to find out.<br /><br />Will there be any organically grown strains? Maybe not necessarily with only OMRI listed products but at least grown cleanly without nasty insecticides or other chemical fertilizers?

				CannaConnection i seriously doubt you will become a vendor, why? because i have not seen one mature post written by yourself. You are like a child on a long journey who consistently asks Are We There yet?<br /><br />If i am wrong i do apologize however i think its safe for me to say that no vendor link will go anywhere near you Forum account.

				I sincerely hope you dont become a vendor. <br />Not because i dislike you personally (Okay i do, but that is besides the point!), but because i really dont want underage toddlers vending here!<br /><br />And before you start stating otherwise; I think it is quite clear that you are an attention starving child, with way to much time on their hands!<br /><br />If you are seriously thinking about vending here though, i would seriously consider starting but deleting your crappy topics, and start conducting yourself in a more professional manner (So people actually perceive you as an adult)!<br /><br />As said in another topic; this is not to bash on you or anything, i just dont think that you seem any way near mature enough to be on a place like this!<br /><br />
