			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi guys,<br /><br />This past weekend I tried acid for the first time, having bought 5 Hofmann&#039;s (110ug) and 5 Mayan Calendars (180ug) from JoR.<br /><br />Long story short, I started off with one Hofmann before moving on to two a couple of hours later. Moving on I ended up taking 3 Mayan Calendars then 3 Hofmann&#039;s two hours later the next day, and nothing. I didn&#039;t have any affects, mood changes, anything. Didn&#039;t have a raised heart beat, didn&#039;t sweat, didn&#039;t have any dilated pupils whatsoever. So that&#039;s appox. 870ug and nada.<br /><br />I did this alone because I started off slow, so I don&#039;t have anyone else&#039; reaction. I know its said that LSD doesn&#039;t work on everything, but having absolutely nothing?!?<br /><br />I finished off the evening with some MDMA (like 8-10 hours later), which was great. But to say I&#039;m bummed is an understatement and is leaving me with the big question of why?<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; ???

				Lots of things can prevent LSD from working.<br /><br />Are you on anti-psycotics or anti-depressants? Have you recently been doing a lot of MDMA or DMT? Were you sleep deprived?<br /><br />I take LSD fairly often and if I have been on other drugs recently or have been not sleeping right it has much less effect. I know someone on anti-depressants who can each 3-5 hits and only have a slight high feeling.<br /><br />Don&#039;t assume you were ripped off like others are saying. I know from the liquid I take that the exact same dose can have dramatically different effects depending on the state of your mind and body and your surroundings.<br /><br />It is a strange drug.

				I would suggest eliminating as many variables as you can to figure it out.<br /><br />Do no other drugs for 5 or so days(weed is fine of course) then after a good night&#039;s sleep try it with a friend who is familiar with LSD. Take it all at once, don&#039;t wait between doses.<br /><br />If you still don&#039;t get high and neither does your friend then it is probably the tabs. Tap water, light and heat can damage these tabs.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t get high and your friend does then it is probably just you.

Yeah I&#039;ll try that. I really didn&#039;t think a drug like LSD could be affected in such seemingly simple ways (sleep, other drugs, etc.) - I did get a good night&#039;s sleep as was careful to drink bottled water only though, buts its definitely worth trying again.

				How strange. The way I normally do it is leave it under my tongue, rather than on my tongue, for about 20 minutes and then swallowing. This method has always worked for me.

				Also don&#039;t drink any water while the tabs are in your mouth! That will ruin it right there. Also don&#039;t dose the next day. You will have to double your dose to get the same effect.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				That&#039;s probably what did it. LSD is destroyed on contact with chlorine and most water has chlorine in it! Wait about a week, preferably two, take a tab or two, leave it in your mouth for a while, don&#039;t drink anything. Swallow it and I&#039;m sure you will trip. Avoid other drugs besides weed.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				I dont know what this is I see alot of people saying LSD no effect or to that nature.<br />As well as alot of this and that theories as to why by sellers.<br />I have done a lot of blotter in my day. Bought big sheets. Right in a public park it was like a supermarket.<br />Never not tripped or a little trip always was good. Trails colors and laughing like hell at the smallest things.<br /><br />One time me and my girlfriend pulled into this park late at time to trip.

				Hey OP,<br /><br />I understand where you&#039;re coming from. I took 100 micrograms on my first trip and while it was interesting, it wasn&#039;t as intense or wild as I was expecting. To be honest, I&#039;ve gotten higher off plain old marijuana.<br /><br />My second trip which was a few weeks later, I took 200 micrograms on an empty stomach. That was fun and the visuals started to kick in slightly but again, nothing in any extreme sense.<br /><br />A few weeks after that I bought 500 micrograms and took it slowly throughout the day and....nothing. I mean there was the faintest alteration of perception but from what I&#039;ve found, as far as my body chemistry is considered, LSD doesn&#039;t build on itself. I either have to take my intended amount all at once or I am not going to bother with it.<br /><br />LSD, like any drug, like what so many wise posters have previously stated, is dependent on the user&#039;s particular make-up but its also affected by things like heat. The postal process is brutal and I think about all the hot trucks, hot planes, atmospheric radiation, ground tremors and machines LSD must pass through before it reaches me and it is no wonder that sometimes, its just not that effective.<br /><br />Welp, its been fun. Time to chase Falkor!

				Hmm this is interesting, I ordered some of JOR&#039;s a few weeks back. While I took 2 and definitely did trip, my friend who also took 2 said he felt nothing...while I realize this information doesn&#039;t really help I hope it&#039;s worth something.

				Well, its OP here. Reporting back.<br /><br />I bought two more tabs from a different vendor. Haven&#039;t used MDMA in over a week, and took two tabs as soon as I picked up the package (within 20 minutes). Left them under my tongue for 20 minutes or so, basically to the point where they disintegrated. Didn&#039;t drink anything.<br /><br />And guess what? Nothing. I can only assume I am some kind of bionic experiment.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />This past weekend I tried acid for the first time, having bought 5 Hofmann&#039;s (110ug) and 5 Mayan Calendars (180ug) from JoR.<br /><br />Long story short, I started off with one Hofmann before moving on to two a couple of hours later. Moving on I ended up taking 3 Mayan Calendars then 3 Hofmann&#039;s two hours later the next day, and nothing. I didn&#039;t have any affects, mood changes, anything. Didn&#039;t have a raised heart beat, didn&#039;t sweat, didn&#039;t have any dilated pupils whatsoever. So that&#039;s appox. 870ug and nada.<br /><br />I did this alone because I started off slow, so I don&#039;t have anyone else&#039; reaction. I know its said that LSD doesn&#039;t work on everything, but having absolutely nothing?!?<br /><br />I finished off the evening with some MDMA (like 8-10 hours later), which was great. But to say I&#039;m bummed is an understatement and is leaving me with the big question of why?<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; ???-<br /><br />Well your problem is. You started off with 100 ugs. then took more 2 hours later, by then the other blotters become inert. That&#039;s like eating another bag of mushies after tripping for two hours, your tolerance is built up and it makes it a waste. Then that also explains why they didn&#039;t work the next day either, as your tolerance was even higher after finishing through your previous &quot;trip&quot;. When taking LSD you want to ensure you are taking the dose you want in one go.<br />
