				Unless you can find a different exchanger or someone that will sell BTC directly to you that you trust, you will have to do multiple 500 dollar loads.

				I was thinking of offering that service as I have a MtGox account verfied and tied to a Bank account..&nbsp; But I have to see if there is a demand once I hit 50 posts...<br /><br />Humm..<br /><br />Already provided over 300 BTC so other undisclosed SR vendors.. <br /><br />

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				I just do multiples thru bitinstant . You don&#039;t have to go to your moneygram location, or whoever you use, more than once , ya just do multiple transactions. I&#039;m sure theres plenty of other way but this works for me and theres no bank accounts involved or buying from the Road outside the escrow system.

Easy method. Using a REloadit card. Min amount: $300. Max : none<br />2. Slightly more difficult method.&nbsp; Using bitinstant and MtGox. Min amount : $20. Max amount : $500.<br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />Order the free guide at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d05b9deccc<br /><br />The reason the guide has to be downloaded is that it is a PDF. It&#039;s clean, well-formatted, and as easy to follow as a recipe. If I were to post it on this forum, it would be a long and hard to follow.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not selling it; I&#039;m giving it away. It&#039;s a chicken-egg problem. How can I sell a guide to acquiring bitcoins to a person who has never acquired a bitcoin?<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide many times with no problems.<br /><br />Happy Road Trip!<br />MedicineWoman<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can testify to this guide, it&#039;s good.<br /><br />Question, MedicineWoman, did you recently change it? I don&#039;t remember the first option in it, with the credit card.

				I&nbsp; personally feel some of the Western Union -&gt; Bitcoin listings here on SR are worth it simply because of the ease of use and elimination of MTGOX&#039;s ridiculous verification setup.<br /><br />Can&#039;t think of a faster easier way to fund an account....if I could verify an account with BITS.ME that would be great because they offer Interac e-Transfer for Canadian customers.

				If you cannot find another method to obtain the BTC, you can do multiple deposits of up to $500 with Bitinstant. <br /><br />Same moneygram location is fine, they might ring you up twice though. <br /><br />However, some advice, try to make your deposits so they are not the same amount. I had a bitinstant deposit held up for nearly 2 days because I had two deposits of equal amounts, and their system flagged it for some reason. When I emailed them, they worked it out but warned me not to do two equal deposits at the same time due to this flagging issue.

				So bitinstant accepts moneygram? <br /><br />EDIT: I guess not, nor do they support Canada....<br /><br />Anyone know of an exchange I can pay with WU/MG that deposits to my SR account?
