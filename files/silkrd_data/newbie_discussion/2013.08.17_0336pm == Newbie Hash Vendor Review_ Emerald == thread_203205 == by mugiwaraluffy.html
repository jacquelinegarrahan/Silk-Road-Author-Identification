				I ordered 50g of his Ali Baba hash a few days just before Tormail went down. <br /><br />I had messaged him a few times before buying from him to see how well he responded etc. He ws very responsive and answered all of my questions promptly.<br /><br />I was supposed to receive my package in 3-6 days according to Emerald&#039;s profile. It took two (2) weeks :-\<br /><br />Not sure why but USPS took forever in delivering this order and at the time Emerald took a small hiatus according to his profile. I tried messaging him after waiting 8 days, but he did not respond after 3 days. To his credit, he did post on his profile that he would be slow to respond to messages during his hiatus. I tried him again 4 days after i sent the first message and this time he responded the next day with my tracking information. At least then my worries eased as I could easily see he had indeed shipped my package and the problem was not on his end.<br /><br />I received it 14 days after Emerald sent it thanks to USPS.<br /><br />The packaging was indeed stealthy. no smell leaking from it. The product is good and the price is great. No complaints whatsoever about Emerald. I recommend him for good decent hash for a great price.<br /><br />All I can say is use tracking when ordering and if you don&#039;t receive it during his estimated shipping time, just send him a message and he&#039;ll give you the tracking info. I&#039;d advise giving him your pgp key so he can encrypt it to you if you feel so inclined. I totally forgot when I asked for the tracking info. Otherwise, it was a smooth though lengthy transaction.
