				Well, I&#039;ve pretty much gone through the wiki and buyers guide but there are still a couple of things I&#039;d like to clear up first if its not too much of a hassle.<br />Before I get on with it however there are some things I should mention first. I&#039;m a backpacker in AUS so I&#039;m not entirely familiar on how all the post business works around here. If my questions seem a bit stupid then try to give me a chance anyway, okay?:)<br /><br />The first thing is, I live in a sharehouse with a bunch of other people but none of us actually pick up the mail. It is sent to a PO box and our landlord picks it up a couple of times a week. I don&#039;t think that the landlord opens the mail when picking it up so that shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Just to be sure, however, I&#039;m buying tabs of acid and am just wondering what the package would look like?. If the he opens the package could he tell straight away that they were drugs or are there some measures to hide it somehow? I know this depends on the supplier so who would you recommend the most if its all right to ask that here?<br /><br />How much time does mail delivery take around here? Especially with the current floods and the like going on?<br /><br />My next question is about Bitcoin. Basically, I&#039;ve decided that I&#039;m going to use BitInnovate. I can use either of the banks that support it, right? It doesn&#039;t have to be the same one that I&#039;ve got my account in since its a simple cash deposit? Also, the wallet address asked at their website is the same one I have on my SR account, is it not?<br /><br />Also, how important is it to use PGP when filling in the order with all the details? It seems to me that&nbsp; the site is quite secure and I&#039;ve read the suppliers information as well where it says that they take all the necessary precautions.<br /><br />Thats all for now. I will probably come up with some other questions by tomorrow.<br />I appreciate all the helpful information I can get, thanks.

				The packaging your order comes in, will depend entirely on how the vendor decides to pack it. Your best bet is message a vendor, and ask them about Stealth Shipping. <br />tbh though, lsd is probably one of the easiest things to conceal, so I wouldn&#039;t worry about that too much. <br /><br />I&#039;m in UK, so I can&#039;t really answer your btc question. Sorry.<br /><br />PGP is essential. No exceptions. Most customers won&#039;t even buy from a vendor that doesn&#039;t have a pgp key.

				All right, thanks for the responses. Going to get myself familiar with PGP then.<br /><br />About btc, I&#039;ve decided that I am not going to use BitInnovate due to the time restriction while making the payment etc. Thinking of using Mt. Gox instead. I can simply transfer money from my bank account to the bitcoin account, right? Is there any risk of tracing it back to my own bank account somehow?

				Just transfer your funds between a couple of your own BitCoin addresses and you should be fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				For anonimizing bitcoins you can also use bitcoin fog:<br />http://www.bitcoinfog.com/<br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/
