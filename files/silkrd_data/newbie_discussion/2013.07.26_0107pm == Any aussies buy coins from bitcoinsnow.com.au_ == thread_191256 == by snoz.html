				I have only bought bitcoins 3 times so far as Ive only just joined SR. The first bitcoin seller I used was really good, I had a choice of 4 banks to deposit cash over the counter into their account and it was in my wallet in 3 hours.<br />The second time I needed coin I bought it from a different seller. They only allowed cash to be deposited at 1 bank and their website says it may take up to 48 hours to reach your wallet, but usually only takes 4 hours. They say if it hasn&#039;t arrived in 4 hours to email them a scan of the deposit receipt and they will investigate the case. Well the coins hadn&#039;t arrived in 4 hours so I sent off a scan like instructed and got no reply until 3 minutes before the 48 hour deadline. They said they were sorry but they had &quot;been delayed by our supplier&quot; and they were working on sourcing new suppliers &quot;so this doesn&#039;t happen again, and you will receive your bitcoins ASAP&quot;. I was annoyed because I had my eye on some goodies which I wanted ASAP like we all do. I kept checking my wallet every few hours over the next couple of days but they still hadn&#039;t arrived. So I shot off an email asking roughly when I could expect it, ASAP could mean anything. Well I got no reply to that email nor the 2 I have sent since! It has been 10 fucking days now and I haven&#039;t received the coins or even a reply. It looks like these cunts may have scammed me and there is no way of contacting them except by email. Their website looks legit, but I just want to know if many other aussies have used their &quot;service&quot; without problems? I&#039;m really pissed off because they have no warning on their site about delays receiving your coins, they are just too happy to take your cash. They should rename their business bitcoinsnextmonthornever! Arseholes&nbsp; &gt;:( <br />The 3rd time was with the first guy again and had it in 3 hours again, awesome. He&#039;s the only guy I will use from now on!

				Thanks mate, I will keep them in mind. Spendbitcoins are the other guys that I used&nbsp; :D<br />I would like to know what action of recourse a customer can take, if the money doesn&#039;t show up they&#039;ve just basically stolen it&nbsp; :o.
