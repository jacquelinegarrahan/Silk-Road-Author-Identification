				this was sketchy also<br /><br />&quot;Note I do not ask you to FE. If upon receipt, you are unhappy with your cocaína or heroína, I will make sure that you receive a full refund. I will have someone pick it up at a drop location near you. &quot;

				At least it&#039;s USA domestic only, I felt sick with anxiety just looking at those listings and imagining them going through customs.

				Decent stealth could get those kind of listings through customs easily.. It does seem like a lot, but it&#039;s not impossible. <br /><br />Granted, I wouldn&#039;t be ordering it myself.&nbsp; :-X

				Well, he does have one good review. I&#039;d say go for it. You can drive your Jetta to the deaddrop. That will impress anyone looking to do you harm.

				- Been a member for 10 months.<br />- 4 transactions however only one feedback.<br />- 70 fans?<br />Doesn&#039;t add up. The feedback was left one month ago could be fake, it reads similar to the Nob&#039;s profile. Who would be mad enough to meet a vendor IRL for a kilo deal with zero credibility? What vendor in his/her/their right mind would want to meet a randomer, especially for a kilo? Dealing/buying keys takes time and trust between both parties, it doesn&#039;t happen overnight! Unless this vendor is planning to abduct you and stick a gun to your head until you release the Bitcoins, or could be bacon, either way stay away.
