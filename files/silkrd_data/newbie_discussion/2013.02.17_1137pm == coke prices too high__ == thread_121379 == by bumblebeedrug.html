				It costs $100/g where I am, I don&#039;t do it but I know a few people that sell and it gets cut. If I was going to buy some I would rather do it here and get higher quality for the same price.

				Some of it&#039;s fair priced for personal. But there&#039;s no room to make anything on it. The coke where I live sucks and it usually run 150 a ball. At least acid and shrooms are priced for bulk now. Thanks to goodfornothing for putting down some competition. Definitely good for something.

				I don&#039;t know, I love coke and I love to get fire for cheap, but think about it. How long has $50 a g been the standard for coke prices? In my opinion, the fact that we (the users) have been unwilling to pay much more than $50 a g for coke is what has made them (the dealers) cut the shit out of it. Because we know that coke and heroin are the only things that LE has actually successfully reduced in america at all (and even then, not by much). So, naturally, that&#039;s going to make the prices go up for the dealers. So if they want to keep selling it to us at $50, they&#039;ve got to cut it more. <br /><br />I tested some $50 a g street coke from a top 10 largest American city and it was less than 20%. I tested some other stuff and it was over half ice.<br /><br />I knew a major dealer on the east cost (kilo a week or more) who would cut his kgs in half with procaine and re press them before selling them to the pushers (I knew at least two of the pushers and they&#039;d cut their stuff in half with that shitty vitamin powder shit). Anyway, I&#039;ve been using coke for 5 years now steadily and in touch with several dealers large and small and honestly, in my experience, that whole scene is grimy as hell.<br /><br />I&#039;d be willing to bet that with most of you, the fire that you buy off the street, is a lot lower quality than you think it is. <br /><br />Oh, and by the way, NEVER buy from skippyjif on SR. I bought an 1/8 of his coke that was supposed to be A/B extracted and acetone washed (a simple procedure that will turn street coke into 80% or better). That shit was COMPLETELY bunk. I think he might have thrown a .1 of real coke in there for the smell before he vacuum sealed it. The shit wouldn&#039;t even dissolve in water. He denied and denied and B.S.ed around with me for ever saying he was going to send me some more and blah blah blah. He never made good on it and he&#039;s a time wasting jackass.<br /><br />

				back about 10 years ago, i used to get 8balls of pure fucking bliss for $120. <br /><br />you gotta pay BIG $$$ on SR to even get close to that quality, and it still falls short.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />...<br /><br />

				When last I was using coke, I was paying $80-100 for 3.5g, and it was all shiny flake. I haven&#039;t used it in about 7 years, but I&#039;d still pay the crazy prices on SR for a little coke vacation, just so I know the quality ahead of time (by reviews) and avoid the trip to the hood, so long as the quality is at least equal to what I was paying before.

				I&#039;ve never been lucky enough to consistently get good coke for under 100 a gram where I live, so paying that on the road for good shit is just fine with me. Anything higher than 100 is a stretch for me to pay, though.

				Bear in mind also that there are a lot of hidden costs in dealing with BTC, between the relatively low transaction fees, the cut you&#039;ll lose when converting it to printed moneys, the cut you&#039;ll lose when &quot;washing&quot; your BTC. There are plenty of problems with BTC if you&#039;re unable to keep your money IN BTC, which, let&#039;s face it, is currently impossible.

				It&#039;s way to high for where I am, but I think that one of the main reasons coke is too high on sr is that for people who don&#039;t have connections, they will pay what they have to. Also many people prefer the convenience of having blow shipped to your door and not having to deal with people f2f.

				When it comes to coke, if you&#039;ve had good coke you know that doing more shitty coke is really nothing like doing good coke. The high itself is different. Of course, you could basify it then salt it out with HCl again, which would get rid of a lot of impurities, then do an ice cold naptha wash over a coffee filter. You&#039;d probably end up with under half a gram per gram, but it&#039;d be much higher quality. I suppose you could even try a slow recrystallization to seed out some impurities. Problem is, when I get coke, even if it&#039;s pure shit, I find it hard to keep myself from doing it. With shitty coke I just wish I hadn&#039;t and don&#039;t enjoy any of it :/

				i personally think they are about right. I live in the UK and normal street coke is cut the fuck out. Lidocaine and all that BS. People are right, this has only happened cos we (the consumers) don&#039;t wanna pay more than £50 for a g or whatever, so they&#039;ve had to cut cut cut. I went to S. America recently and it was fucking dirt cheap. Around £6 a g for a tourist and fucking good flake. But am i expecting that price here? No. SR is where you will find the best quality, maybe the price is a little bit high, but i&#039;d rather not shove shit up my nose for a cheaper price haha

				People keep forgetting that coke is the only drug that has a cartel with the same amount of control. Other drugs aren&#039;t as restricted so free market will eventually create an equilibrium with prices. There is more demand for cocaine than available in the market, high prices, people complain, but it still sells.
