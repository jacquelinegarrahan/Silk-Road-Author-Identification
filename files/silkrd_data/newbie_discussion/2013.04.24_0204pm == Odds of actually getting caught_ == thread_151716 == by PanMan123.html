				What are the odds the police bust down my for me buying 1 tab of acid or 2 pills of mdma? I know they can&#039;t legally do anything until i sign for the package so if customs contacts me i can just ignore it and let them destroy the package. Same if i get the little pink slip telling me to go to the post office where ill have to sign for it. I always thought no way in hell the police would waste their time if im buying such a small amount.

				I am pretty sure that if you are inside the US and the seller uses usps, then they have to attain a federal warrant to open and search your package provided it was poorly packaged or came open during the shipment.

				The odds are always relative to the risk you are taking and it sounds like you a very unclear about the risks involved!<br /><br />In Australia, Domestic orders / International orders carry remarkably different risks.<br /><br />International orders are subject to sniffer dogs, parcel x-ray etc. Customs perform risk assessments and direct more resources toward high risk origin countries, known as a popular source of narcotics - this cargo will automatically receive significantly more attention. The data is also constantly updated based on seizures during the year, a lot of data analysis helps increase detections by allocating the border protection resources more efficiently. Example, you are taking a much greater risks sourcing from areas like the Golden Triangle, South America, Netherlands etc. <br /><br />Another factor in customs risk assessment is simple economics. Smugglers move products to make a profit - there is no point smuggling product to a country where its valued at the same or less than where it originated. They are not providing a service or &quot;spreading the joy&quot; the driving force is financial gain. Analysis of data such as street prices internationally help establish the logical flow and direction narcotics follow. Again putting customs resources to best use targeting goods from these origins.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the layers of this risk analysis and explain in depth other concepts but it is just far too complex for most people and definitely too complicated for this post. Importing narcotics in Australia is a fairly high risk venture, there are definitely practices which aid to mitigate that risk but there is certainly no formula to ensure success. This is definitely not something I would risk doing personally as interesting as the challenge may be! But, I am glad there are people who cannot say no to a challenge haha<br /><br />Domestic on the other hand is very low risk in Australia, sniffer dogs are not really used for domestic mail and it is seldom x-rayed. The major risks here I see relate to wrong delivery and your mail with contraband being opened by others, poor packaging of smell exposing the illicit contents, vendor gets caught with the narcotics before it gets mailed, vendor has been targeted by LE and your identity is discovered. Still not free of risk but considerably less chance of being caught, and less penalties if you do get busted because you have not broken any customs laws.<br /><br />People should know more about what they are doing and the risks involved before blindly doing things which could adversely effect their lives...

				straight out of my ass, assuming decent packaging, no bad practices (like checking tracking with Tor) and not massive weights, I would guess that the chances of a domestic interception are about 1:10,000 and for international probably more like 1:100 .

				odds are low until they are HIGH.. very high.. <br /><br />U dont even have to be at fault. The vendor could fuk up, could have slipped somewhere and get it flagged and with tabs u are getting charged with the weight of the paper. FYI...<br />so best is to never even start.. but if u do just cover your ass and have a VERY good lawyer in your hip pocket cause its very very tru.. if u cant do the time DONT do the crime.&nbsp;

				U need to look at it the other way... Like guilty until proven innocent... U need to think busted until ingestion. <br /><br />Cause u can do all u can do.. Like getting in a car. U can be the best driver in the world. But that old lady that just dozed off at the wheel next to u cause she 900 years old and should not be driving herself to Get her meds just drifted into you and sent u flying off a bridge. <br /><br />U have no control of anything. Just a series of calculated risks. But always remember if u were busted do u have your plan in line do u have your lawyer ready... Can u have a business without proper insurance these days. <br /><br />Damn not even close to 50 yet!
