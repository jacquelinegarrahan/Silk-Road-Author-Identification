				so, i&#039;ve been a long time viewer of silkroad since i was a newb at computers, and recently decided to take it seriously and actually buy something instead of saying &quot;HOLY SHIT, hes selling 5,000,000$ worth of acid?!&quot;, so i created an account and will add bitcoins shortly, but i read that if you receive an order and the postman asks for your signature its likely a police setup, have any of you EVER been asked for a signature when recieving a package from the SilkRoad

				You read right, most vendors won&#039;t get delivery confirmation unless it&#039;s for a huge order and even then pretty sure most just use tracking. Ask your vendor if you received a notice that you need to sign for a package. That is unless you ordered something legal that needs signing for.

				<br />I personally would not sign for anything unless I was expecting to. But really I would never want to sign for anything from SR. It is like an admission of guilt.

				I&#039;ve signed B4 but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. Once was for an order from that Smile Awhile dude whose product was pretty much legendary but he shipped from a wierd foreign country and required signatures, so I chanced it. Another time just recently a new vendor fucked up and didn&#039;t waive the sig. I wanted the product so, again, chanced it.

				I personally love purchasing online and get packages delivered to my home on a constant basis (non-SR I&#039;m referring to) and I have yet to sign for a single package in the last several years. Regardless of UPS, FedEx, USPS or even who ever the hell DHL hires (they send anyone that has a license and a running vehicle) will leave the package sitting on my porch. Some ring the doorbell and walk away but most don&#039;t even do that.<br /><br />Like the poster of this topic I&#039;ve been in and out of SR the last couple years (lost my old user name) but just never knew enough (or had the need really) to use SR since I had good local connections. That being said I now have the need and am about to make a purchase once I finish doing a little more research. One thing I know for SURE is that if the postman rings my bell and waits at my door, I&#039;m not answering or signing for shit! No way. That would be a major red flag and if I lose my money in the process, oh well, i&#039;ll still give the vendor his 5/5 since I know when I do order and deal with the right vendor it won&#039;t be their fault. God knows a few grams of weed isn&#039;t worth the ringer they will put you through if they do catch you.<br /><br />One question I have to post though is, has anyone heard of, or do they practice writing &quot;return to sender&quot; on the box when they recieve it and then maybe wait a day to open it, just in case? I know when I get the package it will be very hard to do, but I want to take any and all precautions and it seems to me that if you got a package, didn&#039;t sign, and they raided you the next day anyway, that an unopened box with &quot;return to sender&quot; would be about the most solid form of &quot;plausible deniability&quot; you can have. Has anyone been in this situation? I would hope not, but wondering if it works.

It will cost their dept. 10 times what they get out of you for the bust but we all know that won&#039;t stop them.

				Keep in mind that even if you say no to the controlled delivery they have a search warrant. To be honest saying no might even lead to LESS plausible deniability. Most people don&#039;t say no to packages.<br /><br />Regardless of a yes or no answer they will still break down your door and ransack the house searching for more drugs.

If they knock on my door when an SR package is expected, I&#039;m simply not going to answer the door. If they leave with the package then they can keep it and add it to their evidence collection and I&#039;ll discontinue ordering for at least 6 months (maybe that&#039;s paranoid) but either way I&#039;m not taking the package or making an appearance. Just remember DO NOT TALK TO LE, and if you all of sudden are required to sign for a package that you KNOW you shouldn&#039;t have to sign for (ie domestic shipments) then you more than likely have LE of some sort at your door and your best bet is to avoid. If you never take the package, what will they get a warrant for? Unless they have some solid IT forensics to prove you ordered (which they won&#039;t if you follow the great advice here) then you will be in the clear.

Regardless of UPS, FedEx, USPS or even who ever the hell DHL hires (they send anyone that has a license and a running vehicle) will leave the package sitting on my porch. Some ring the doorbell and walk away but most don&#039;t even do that.<br /><br />Like the poster of this topic I&#039;ve been in and out of SR the last couple years (lost my old user name) but just never knew enough (or had the need really) to use SR since I had good local connections. That being said I now have the need and am about to make a purchase once I finish doing a little more research. One thing I know for SURE is that if the postman rings my bell and waits at my door, I&#039;m not answering or signing for shit! No way. That would be a major red flag and if I lose my money in the process, oh well, i&#039;ll still give the vendor his 5/5 since I know when I do order and deal with the right vendor it won&#039;t be their fault. God knows a few grams of weed isn&#039;t worth the ringer they will put you through if they do catch you.<br /><br />One question I have to post though is, has anyone heard of, or do they practice writing &quot;return to sender&quot; on the box when they recieve it and then maybe wait a day to open it, just in case? I know when I get the package it will be very hard to do, but I want to take any and all precautions and it seems to me that if you got a package, didn&#039;t sign, and they raided you the next day anyway, that an unopened box with &quot;return to sender&quot; would be about the most solid form of &quot;plausible deniability&quot; you can have. Has anyone been in this situation? I would hope not, but wondering if it works.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />oh my god, thats brilliant, i&#039;ve only had to sign for a package once, it was an AK-74u lololol, i live in a good neighborhood now with very little crookery, so i left a note saying &quot;leave the package my good UPS guy&quot; and he did, I have good connections at my college, but in summer i lose all mine, so all my purchases are going to be in summer, but ill tell you what, that is actually a really good idea, i may do that, did you read the cannabis corner article about the guy leaving his weed parcel on the table for a day to look like a wrong package? but if i was a cop id call BS, no one sends weed to the wrong person, although when i was 13 we recieved some sexual items and my parents bitched me out for 4 hours before they realized it was our neighbors XD, funny shit though, handcuffs, gags and whips are definitely what a 13 year old kid buys, but since they send it from an invalid location it would probably work, i might do that<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, appreciate the nice comment. Yeah I&#039;m sure leaving it sit for a day or two wouldn&#039;t hurt either way. If they kick your door in and the package is unopended they don&#039;t have shit on you and you play dumb. But based on what I&#039;ve read thus far on this forum, that&#039;s highly unlikely. Especially if you are ordering less than a QP of weed, they don&#039;t want you, they want the source. It will cost their dept. 10 times what they get out of you for the bust but we all know that won&#039;t stop them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />that makes me so happy, im going to buy 14 grams and i get so paranoid the feds are going to open the package and come bust my ass or that someone in my house is going to find it, but you&#039;re right, they wont waste 500$ on 140$ of pot<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />True but whatever you do don&#039;t let your guard down. Like you I&#039;ll probably only order that amount, but regardless I&#039;m going to take the same precaution that someone getting a huge shipment would. Mix your coins, use PGP, don&#039;t sign for package, use tails or keep your windows drive encrypted, or just don&#039;t keep any incriminating data at all.<br /><br />Like another poster said, such great advice. No one ever regretted being too safe, but will always regret not being safe enough.<br /><br />Be safe and good luck!

But that&#039;s why I stress so much to not answer if you KNOW for sure you don&#039;t have to sign (and you will know). Whats strange about someone not being home? And I would be uber paranoid if all of a sudden they wanted a signature, when they never asked when they drop a $200 value package on your doorstep and walk away. And lets say that even if you do this, they still bust your door in, what do they have on you? You don&#039;t have the package so no contraband. If they confiscate your computer, and you are using something like TAILS or have your Windows drives encrypted, again they don&#039;t have shit on you. The only other way they could get you is if they have the tor system and even SR compromised and already have evidence that you made a purchase, and I&#039;m betting if this is the case, there will be no CD, they will simply bust your door in.<br /><br />Of course there are times you do have to sign, if you order international, but I don&#039;t know of one domestic vendor in the US anyway that requires this and I can tell you I won&#039;t order from a vendor that does require this or order from overseas. If the vendor tells me I don&#039;t have to sign and they come asking for a signature, and it was in fact requested by the vendor, that vendor is getting 1/5 and a nasty message, but I have yet to see where this has happened, at least domestically anyway. All bets are off for international.<br /><br />But all in all I&#039;m a noob and basing this off of what I&#039;ve read on the forums, so maybe my reasoning is flawed but either way I&#039;m doing whatever I can to aviod any facetime with LE. If it comes to that I will quickly &quot;lawyer up&quot; as they love to say and they know at that point if they don&#039;t have evidence they may as well let you walk.<br /><br />peace and good luck!

Warrants are near impossible to get, but those minimum price shipping options, they can open those without a warrant, they just claim it as &quot;making sure it qualifies for the right shipping option&quot; packages are safer than letters but if you get a letter from SR at minimum shipping price, it is DEFINITELY going to be searched by USPS, my friend has 30 years at the USPS and they&#039;re absolutely required to look through the letters and read them, so if you&#039;re really interested in securing your investment BUY THE BEST SHIPPING OPTION, when he told me this i was absolutely mindfucked, it turns out when i ordered an AK online, he was the one who opened it and passed it for approval, hes a very good friend.&nbsp; &nbsp; (read this, its worth it)

We all know, they do a great job of brainwashing the masses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />i have 2 brothers, one is older than me, i wont say his age but hes 3 years older and has never touched a single drug in his life, hasnt even smoked or drank alcohol, but when pot was up for voting, everyone in the family except for my mom (my little brother cant vote, too young) voted yes on it cause my family knows i smoke, my older bro says &quot;hey, its just pot, if you&#039;re responsible its fine&quot;, even my brother, whos never used it, believes in peoples rights. my dad said &quot;when you&#039;re 18, smoke as much as you want, its your right&quot; my mom said &quot;OH MY GOD, POT CAUSES LIVER FAILURE AND CAN LEAD TO AIDS!!!!&quot; quite literally, shes mentally incompetent, believes 9/11 was caused by aliens of planet nibiru , im not joking about it, growing up she would always tell me how 9/11 was caused by aliens from the planet called nibiru, and whats even worse, she brainwashed my little brother into thinking &quot;pot is the worlds worst sin, aliens caused 9/11, the government is outside of our house, and that the world is going to explode for all of our sins&quot; he lives with me when shes too whacked out on pain medication to even acknowledge anybody, he actually couldnt sleep some night and i asked him what was wrong, this is what he said &quot;mom says the government is going to kill me for what i did&nbsp; and im going to hell&nbsp; because i looked up a bad website on the internet, im SORRY, I DONT WANT TO GO TO HELL, HELP ME D:&quot; and he was bawling his eyes out, i thought he meant porn which i told him that EVERY guy does it&nbsp; and not to listen to mom, but it turns out he was on wikipedia, looking up the NSA PRISM scandal, and so i let him use my computer to look up whatever he wanted, lololol, but my mom actually convinced him that if you even walk next to someone thats smoking weed you&#039;ll get cancer and that they&#039;ll try to kill you, it just goes to show that the people who DONT use logic, influence their kids and then the cycle repeats, he wasnt scared of monsters or the boogyman, he was scared of the government and going to hell, all because 1 woman had to infringe on their childs right to form his own opinion, i learned my opinions from my dad and figured that if something doesnt affect me, i shouldnt stop it from happening, i say people should have the right to have a gay marriage, i say people should be able to use substances as long as they arent operating a car, i say people can do anything they want as long as it isnt physically affecting others. sorry for the rant, people need to fucking use logic though<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I hope you can help open your bros eyes, it&#039;s sad that people have that perception, but that&#039;s what a life of brainwashing will get you. I was certainly there at one point. On the bright side, we can actually get real info and not the bs propaganda spewed to us on daily basis on major tv networks, plus at least when it comes to pot, anyone who&#039;s sane and ever tried it knows how fucking stupid it is that it&#039;s illegal. My family is history of drunks, beating their wives, not keeping jobs, being geneal lowlifes but I&#039;ve been a smoker since a teen, always held a job and put my family first.<br /><br />The sad reality is that your bro is probably right to be scared of the government more than anything since odds are they will fuck with you before anyone else does, and it sounds like your Mom needs a does of reality. I don&#039;t think 9/11 was done by aliens, definitely humans, but I also don&#039;t think they were a bunch of Muslims hiding in a cave in Afghanstan, more like humans hiding in a cave in Washington DC :)

				Like everyone stated before, do not sign for a package (or even go pick one up) unless you knew it required a signature beforehand. <br /><br />With that said, if you are ordering personal amounts, LE will not waste their time setting up a CD. You will most likely receive a love letter from them if they do find personal amounts, unless there is a strong indication your house is full of other drugs. <br /><br />Ideally everyone would have their mailing address be completely different from where they keep their drugs, but since that&#039;s not possible for a lot of people, it&#039;s best to just be cautious. If you see the mailman outside waiting for you to sign, take that time to hide whatever you can just in case. If it&#039;s a CD, then whether you answer the door or not, they can bust in and search your house.

				Never sign for a package that you did not expect to sign for.&nbsp; It is simple as that.&nbsp; You cannot receive international express packages in the US without signing.&nbsp; You cannot receive international express packages in most countries without signing.&nbsp; So either order domestic without signing or sign when you expect to sign.

				There is never a reason for them to require a signature. DC is good enough. If they are requiring signatures that means they don&#039;t know much about shipping.<br /><br />That said, I would sign for any package that was delivered to my place, just assuming it was some crap someone bought. Signing for some package proves exactly nothing whatsoever. The extremely simple rule to remember is, if you are guilty and get caught, don&#039;t say a word, if you have to,&quot;none of your business&quot; or &quot;I want a lawyer&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a sucker and let them trick you, and don&#039;t think you can trick them. Give them nothing, and they have nothing. At least they have a hell of a lot less. Less is more.

I learned at a young age that the police are not harbingers of safety.
