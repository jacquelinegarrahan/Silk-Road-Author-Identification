PGP&#039;ing has nothing to do with IP addresses

				OK I decided to take the PGP plunge myself. Maybe I should not use google but the main link to pgp gives me a re-direct to symantec where the only thing available is a trial version. I can get something called gpgforwin ( I have a windows 7 platform ) is this the same thing? I have to do some reading

				GPG4USB is pretty slick and easy to use for our purposes. Kleopatra works but doesn&#039;t support direct clipboard operations. You definitely do not need to pay for software to use PGP.

I have been following the Snowden case intensely, and i dont believe he has said such thing at any point, so i would like to see some evidence!<br /><br />Furthermore; you are talking about paying taxes, of this sites revenue. I&#039;m not sure if you are really as stupid as you seem, or what is up, but i got one word for you: MONEY-LAUNDERING! Ever heard of that? Its actually quite a clever concept. See you run money through the system, while making it seem like they are legit in some way. There are numerous ways of doing this, but i dont think it would be productive to elaborate, as you do not seem to understand the concept of rational thinking!<br /><br />Let me just ask you this: This crusade of panic-mongering you seem to be running against this place, is it just Silk-road you are trying to bash, or are you also trying to discredit BMR or ATLANTIS.?<br /><br />I really think that this shit-spewing you seem to be jacking off to, is the lonely cry of a social looser, with no friends, no life, and no brains, so would you please leave the grown-ups alone, and get on your way? Pls, go spam reddit or some other shitforum instead, where the collective IQ is low enough to actually make people gullible enough to listen to your incoherent ramblings!<br /><br />This is getting real old, real fast!!!<br /><br />Last i would like to thank the admins, and mods for all of your awesome work, and the extreme patience you guys seem to be possessing. I know if it was me, i would really want to bash in the skull of this delusional fuck-tard!
