				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />So I created my SR account a few months back.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t understand the difference between a password and a PIN, but I quickly figured it out.<br /><br />I reset my PIN to be the same as my password (bad idea? I don&#039;t think so.. I&#039;ve never used my SR username or password anywhere else before, so good luck cracking that) and I tested that my new PIN was working just fine.<br /><br />Placed a couple of orders using the new PIN and everything ran smooth.<br /><br />Fast forward to today.&nbsp; Last night I generated a new wallet address and transferred a few of my bitcoins into it. Waited 12 hours for my money to show up in my account, and go to complete a transaction.&nbsp; INVALID PIN, YOU HAVE 5 TRIES.<br /><br />&quot;Bullshit!&quot; I proclaimed and quickly panicked.&nbsp; I continued 3 more times until I had one try left.&nbsp; I then used a notepad-like app to type my (rather long) PIN out, visually verifying that it was correct, and then pasted it into the PIN field.&nbsp; Failed again.<br /><br />Now my SR wallet is locked for 72 hours and my PIN is completely FUBARed.&nbsp; I&#039;m really distressed and aggravated at this situation:&nbsp; I KNOW what my PIN is.&nbsp; I set it myself.&nbsp; I used it to complete two transactions in the past.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s gone bonkers and I&#039;m panicking at the thought of my $300 being stuck in the SR forever with no way for me to get it back out.<br /><br />What&#039;s a SR noob to do?&nbsp; I&#039;m really having a hard time making any sense of this.&nbsp; Did I do something wrong when I created a new bitcoin address?&nbsp; (My funds show the correct amount)<br /><br />I want to make a purchase ASAP but I can&#039;t do anything with my current PIN.&nbsp; Do I have to make a new SR account if I want to spend my coins today instead of in 72 hours (Assuming, somehow magically, that my PIN that was no good today is suddenly valid this weekend)?&nbsp; <br /><br />Most importantly: is there any recovery process in the world that can help me get my $$$ back if SR won&#039;t accept my PIN?

				After 72 hours you will be able to reset it. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When you register an account on Silk Road, you must create a PIN. Your PIN is in addition to your login passphrase and is required when making a purchase, transferring funds, withdrawing funds, and when making important updates.<br /><br />If you forget your PIN, you will have 5 chances to enter it correctly before it is locked. After your 5th unsuccessful try, you will be redirected to the homepage where you will be shown a message with the time remaining before you can unlock your PIN. After waiting for the allotted time, that message will turn into a link to a page where you can create a new PIN.<br /><br />If you see this message, but you have not used your 5 PIN entry attempts, it could mean that someone else has gained access to your account and is trying to reset your PIN. If this is the case, you should change your password asap and change your PIN once the wait time is over.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=PIN<br /><br />

				Same thing happened to me!&nbsp; First time making purchase, like a good boy I updated Tor AND changed password and PIN (as is suggested here).&nbsp; I transferred in my Bitcoin, no problem.&nbsp; Entered my order (using my new PIN) and same thing, incorrect you have 5 attempts left......<br /><br />Now I&#039;m also locked out for 72 hours.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if my resetting my password and PIN didn&#039;t load and save to the system that the order form checks with.&nbsp; Because I placed my order (with new PIN) withing 15 min of changing it.<br /><br />Of course like an idiot, I didn&#039;t try (in one of my 5 attempts) my &#039;old&#039; PIN.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll never know.<br /><br />So I feel your pain.&nbsp; And here we sit waiting for 72 hours.<br /><br />
