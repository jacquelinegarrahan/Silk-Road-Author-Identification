				How long does it usually take SR Support to respond? I made a withdrawal that is not showing up in blockchain or my other wallet. It has been about 24 hours.

				Yes, this is a known issue.&nbsp; Things are very slow right now, so just try to be patient.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve messaged them, they will eventually respond or resolve the issue.

Just to clarify... I meant it had been 24 hours since the withdrawal, not since I&#039;ve contacted SR Support. If there is a known issue with withdrawals that SR staff is working on, I have all the patience in the world. Thanks for the reassurance.

				Well, inigo has been on this evening, so I would hope that he read our messages and informed whoever needed to be informed so they could resolve this.

				So we aren&#039;t sure if there is an issue with withdrawals, but SR staff will address them as they arise via SR Support messaging. Is this correct?

				Thank you, I really appreciate that - today in particular!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Anyway, it seems that things are somewhat slow at the moment with support, but they always do come through in the end.&nbsp; Hang in there!

				Hey scouty, If there&#039;s anyway you could message inigo or anyone else about this to get the process moving faster, I would gladly make a bigger donation, as the missing funds in questions are definitely not chump change. I saw a similar thread about this one time, I wonder how it all worked out...

				Keep hanging in there -- I&#039;ve seen several people post that they received their coins along with an apology from DPR.&nbsp; It&#039;s just taking a while because they have to handle each case individually, but they WILL get this sorted out for you!<br /><br />You&#039;ve already contacted SR Support, right?&nbsp; If so, that&#039;s all you / we can do at this point.&nbsp;
