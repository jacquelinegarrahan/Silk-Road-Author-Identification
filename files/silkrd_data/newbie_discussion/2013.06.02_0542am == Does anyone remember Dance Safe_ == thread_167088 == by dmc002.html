				Does anyone on here remember the Dance Safe forums? This whole community kind of reminds me of Dance Safe. There were some really awesome people there who were serious about harm reduction and really knew there drugs.

Yea back in 2000 this was the site to check all the mdma going round. In fact I would never buy or take anything without checking first and matching photos and descriptions.&nbsp; The pictures were spot on and so were most of the chemical break downs.<br /><br />BUT, this site is nothing at all like that one!&nbsp; :)

				Yeah I know this site is different and in a much better way! But with the whole LSD Avengers and the Deemsters or whatever the DMT guys call themselves it really reminds me of DS.

				You made it sound like Dance Safe was no longer around.<br />They are alive and kicking, and yes I have used them many years ago.<br />Though I&#039;ve found Pill Reports infinitely more useful since then.

				Well ya know after thinking a little more about it, I guess it could be compared with this one. With the fact that we do have pictures and descriptions of products but, the big difference is that on dance safe they dd not have vendors that were readily available to access. Man did I ever try to find them on there though. Luckily, I lived by a major city at that time and the mdma was flowing mad. <br /><br />Thanks again for the memory. Brought back some real gemz. haha&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah X was flowing mad everywhere back then. Also the site is still up but the forums are down. I learned so much from the awesome people who used to post in those forums. I am that much wiser just for having been close to so many awesome people.
