				Hello to all roaders! It seems like lately the forums have been all about who is scamming who and nobody stops and talks about the venders who are doing God&#039;s work on the road. Both newbies and old timers need to be hipped to the real pros out there.<br /><br />My fave vender on the road is EastCoastFuego. He is fast, inexpensive, great communication and there is not much you can&#039;t ask for if you become a regular. <br /><br />If pharmacueticals and/or bud is what your looking for hit him up. He will deal with newbies as long as they read the listing, and he will never ask you to FE. When you&#039;re a pro, you don&#039;t need buyers to FE, the shit is getting to the door!!! I love knowing I can just order, no bullshit and it arrives, every time, no prob.<br /><br />Also, one time I had a broken tooth and was in agonizing pain. Fuego upgraded my priority to Express and ended my agony overnight. I offered to send over the additional coin but he wasn&#039;t having it. Good human. Check him out!
