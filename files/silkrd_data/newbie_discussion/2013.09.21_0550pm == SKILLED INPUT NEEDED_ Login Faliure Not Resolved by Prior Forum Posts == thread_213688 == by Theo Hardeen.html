				I&#039;m a new SR user with a couple transactions under my belt and am having an issue that I&#039;m hoping someone can help me resolve. I&#039;ve searched 20+ posts on the forums about login issues, but none has helped with my particular issue. I&#039;ve got a bunch of BTC sitting in my account and am trying to determine if I&#039;ve been hacked. I suspect not, but eliminating other possibilities is the only way I can be sure.<br /><br />Here are my issues:<br /><br />1. I&#039;d been successfully using my main SR account for a month when I stopped being able to login. Every time I input my password, the page reloads and gives me a &quot;login failed, please try again&quot; message. As recommended on the forums, clicking the &quot;go&quot; button manually, changing my browser settings, and refreshing for over an hour did not help. I&#039;ve tried many times again over the last two weeks, making sure each time that I have the correct URL and am not being phished.<br /><br />2. As per forum advice, I started a new account to ask for a password reset, suspecting that my account may have been compromised. Here&#039;s where it starts to get confusing: I was able to get onto SR after creating my new account and sent admins a message, but the following day and all days afterwards I have been unable to login to this account also. All the same tricks were tried, all to no effect.<br /><br />3. Several days later I started a SECOND new account. This time, I logged off immediately after getting onto SR and tried to login with the password I had created two minutes prior. Same result: &quot;login failed, please try again.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I feel like I may have had this issue before and that it was an issue with cookies or Javascript, but I&#039;ve changed settings for both several times and nothing happened. Am I just missing something here? I&#039;m new to the Deep Web and am trying to educate myself as much as possible, so any advice or expertise would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks!

				You should definitely not be using javascript and I would be clearing your cookies after every session.<br />Second, I would try from a different computer. I suspect somebody has an active trojan on your computer. You&#039;ll need to run a scan. Make sure you don&#039;t use your operating system to run the scan. Use a bootable cd to scan your computer, or remove your drive and plug it into a secondary computer that has not been compromised.<br />Last but not least, you should be using tails anyway. It&#039;s the most secure method of access.<br />Sorry to hear that you&#039;ve lost your accounts. Did you type out your password in a notepad to make sure it was correct and then copy and paste it into the password field?<br />Unforuntately, the nature of SR is such that you&#039;ll probably not be able to retrieve your account(s).<br />You can&#039;t really prove that you are who you are.<br />Good luck - if you have any other questions just post them here. I&#039;m a sys admin / software developer of over 20 years and I&#039;ve worked closely in security for quite some time. Sounds like your passwords are being logged and used by somebody else.<br />My next suggestion is to get a good firewall/anti-v software for your normal computer - even if you&#039;re going to start using tails, don&#039;t sacrifice your security for anything. I suggest using eset - and use a valid copy that you actually pay for. Don&#039;t use pirated anti-virus warez. Bad idea. Buy it - no exceptions. It&#039;s fairly inexpensive for the security and peace of mind you&#039;ll get from it.<br />Peace -
