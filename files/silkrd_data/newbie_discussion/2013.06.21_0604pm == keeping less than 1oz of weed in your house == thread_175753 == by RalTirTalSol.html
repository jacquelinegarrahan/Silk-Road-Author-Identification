				I see plenty of people shouting that keeping the ordered drugs in your house in a huge no-no.<br /><br />But then again I see plenty of people admitting to using SR only for small quantities of weed using their home address. I can&#039;t imagine everybody having a separate stash somewhere for small quantities like that. Hiding it well seems good enough, considering the popo is unlikely to break down your door and search the house thoroughly.<br /><br />So how dangerous is it really?

				It&#039;s not very dangerous at all as long as your neighbors don&#039;t suspect you of suspicious activity and you are not already a suspected drug dealer/user. No matter what the officer who comes to your door and asks to take a look around tells you, the only way the police can search your house is if they have a warrant. The only way they can get a warrant is if they have a legitimate reason to believe you are committing crimes in your house. Getting suspicious packages from around the world is not enough for a warrant. <br /><br />But if your neighbors have been complaining to the police about you such as saying your dealing/doing drugs at your house then the police could have grounds for a warrant. This is the way most drug dealers where I live get busted. Your neighbors are spying on you whether you know it or not. Be aware of this and take appropriate precautions. <br /><br />Another way they might get a warrant and search your house is if you are already under investigation. In that case it&#039;s probably best if you didn&#039;t order drugs through the mail at all. At least for now.

				I see the logic in having a stash location if you&#039;re getting it shipped to you&#039;re house, but if you can organise getting it you&#039;re drugs shipped to a drop not linked to you then you should be safe keeping it at your house. Personally, I buy here for reselling and haven&#039;t had anything send to my house in months and have several drops with no connection to my real identity but I keep my stash at home. Just don&#039;t sell out of home and be smart and safe
