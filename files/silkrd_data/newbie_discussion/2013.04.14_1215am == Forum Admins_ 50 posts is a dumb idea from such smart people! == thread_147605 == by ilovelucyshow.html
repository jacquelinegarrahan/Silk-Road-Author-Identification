				<br />A post count minimum also forces people to ask their legitimate, and perhaps complex questions in the newbie forum, just because they haven&#039;t spent their time previously hanging out here posting their asses off.<br /><br />This leads to terrible organization, since people are forced to lump all their posts into the newbie forum.

				You are then left with a newbie forum consisting of three main types of messages:<br /><br />1. SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM<br /><br />2. Legitimate questions that are at the &quot;newbie&quot; skill level.<br /><br />3. Random, more complex posts, usually questions, asked my people that know ehat they are doing, but NEED to ask a question and haven&#039;t yet done the 50 post purgatory. <br />

				This means that some good quality posts are lost in the overwhelming noise of the newbie forums, instead of being located where they should be.<br /><br />Posting in the wrong area is strongly frowned upon by most forums. If I post and advance topic in the newbie section of a programming forum, I&#039;m likely to get scolded for it. And an Admin would likely move the post to the appropriate area.<br /><br />Not so here! Here, your policies encourage it! Most users have fewer than 50 posts, so EVERYTHING goes in one area.

				If you&#039;ve been here lurking then you should already be well aware of why this policy was implemented, and equally well aware of the bitcoin spammers.&nbsp; The policy has nothing to do with forcing newbies to learn - it has everything to do with giving us a slight advantage in our fight against the bitcoin spam.

				This forum has a lot of dumb ideas.<br />In my personal opinion, I&#039;d get rid of the forum altogether, and integrate it fully with the main site- sort of like social networking, only Exclusive to silk road. This way, people can rate products, leave comments on them, favorite them, share them with friends and other users, start threads, ect.

				The other moderator told you that because for new members, it IS suggested that they spend time reading up on PGP and other safety measures.&nbsp; <br /><br />I get that you don&#039;t agree with the policy - that&#039;s fine, but it&#039;s not going to change the fact that the policy is in place.&nbsp; <br /><br />By requiring 50 posts, we are usually able to delete the bitcoin spammers&#039; accounts before they are able to flood the rest of the forums with their spam.

That&#039;s a problem, Dude!<br /><br />And now that I realize the forum admins didn&#039;t even know about the new limit, I think it&#039;s an even WORSE idea. The least you could do is put a sticky in each sub-forum, letting people know of the changes. Not that that would help those users that follow a link to their vendor forum page, then can&#039;t figure out why they can&#039;t do a review.<br /><br />If this change was really required, it should have been better communicated.<br /><br />I&#039;ve invested a LOT of time and money in SR, and the community. I think my frustration is well deserved and I SERIOUSLY doubt that I&#039;m the only experienced user that was caught by surprise with this change.<br /><br />BTW, I just saw one of the top vendors on SR had updated the status on their vendor page. They are going to be down for a few days following the crash. They complained that they couldn&#039;t post an update IN THIER OWN VENDOR FORUM THREAD because they didn&#039;t meet the new post count minimum. No matter how you spin it, vendors not being able to post in their own vendor thread is hosed up! <br />

				It&#039;s a slightly counter-intuitive move for a community that relies so heavily on member feedback and contribution, but I see the reasoning behind the decision. I do hate spam (though ironically I&#039;m now being forced to do it myself to reach 50!)<br /><br />But the mods/whoever seem perfectly happy for us to post any nonsense here so it hardly takes too much commitment.
