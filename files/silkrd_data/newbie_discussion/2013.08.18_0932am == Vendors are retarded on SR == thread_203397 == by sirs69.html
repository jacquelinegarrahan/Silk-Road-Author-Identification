				First and foremost, this is NOT to knock any one individual. There is a very evident problem with many vendors that they cannot fill orders, reply to messages, or even fix an order that was screwed up. Clearly these vendors are selling way more product than they can handle. I call this the Butterfly Labs effect, sometimes turning into just that, vaporware!<br /><br />It&#039;s completely retarded to get to 50 posts just so I can message vendors in their &quot;active review thread(s)&quot;, that they only seem to care about. When messaging fails where do you go next? The time in days to get to the &#039;Resolution center&#039; wait time is ridiculous and even when you get that far, they may not even honor it! Sure slap them with a 1/5 or whatever, to larger vendors this means jack sh*t as they largely don&#039;t care.<br /><br />Bottom line, don&#039;t sell more than what you can handle. It only pisses people off. If you must take the orders, make it a full time job or get trusted friends to assist with all the &quot;bullsh*t the customer spews&quot;. Without customers you will fail.<br /><br />I&#039;m done ranting, sorry if this offends anyone, I truly don&#039;t care!

				sorry, the nice guy routine never works. i&#039;ve been nice in every message and i&#039;ve used many different vendors. if they don&#039;t answer their messages, what&#039;s the point of selling in the first place. i certainly don&#039;t bug anyone inside of a week unless it was &#039;express&#039; or the order is obviously screwed up. i like many other sheep almost always rate 5/5 for fear of being put on the epic blacklist or hall of shame. the buck stops here, at least with my coins.<br /><br />most transactions go fine, the ones that don&#039;t usually turn into a nightmare for the buyer.

				Thankfully most people have had nothing but positive experiences with vendors.<br /><br />I must say, as a new vendor myself, that I try overly hard to be nice and kind and helpful to any prospective customers.&nbsp; I need you guys and am grateful for all business.&nbsp; So, for anyone that was an ass, I apologize. <br /><br />Better luck next time?

The fact is all Vendors have a certain threshold of how many orders they can process per day until it becomes too much. In the real world this regularly happens when Holiday Seasons approaches, so the companies hire new workers in anticipation of it and lay them off when things calm down. Now for obvious reasons it doesn&#039;t work the same here so instead what happens is just as described there&#039;s a massive bottleneck and either the Vendor keeps quiet about it, raise his prices to reduce demand or limit the scope of the Listings by for example setting it to Domestic Only ( happened to for example the Swedish Vendor MailPharma who had too high demand and switched from shipping to EU to Domestic Only and remains so at the time of writing ).<br /><br />Now there are three different perspectives as I see it:<br /><br />Buyers: The buyers has the power to stop buying from Vendors who simply are overloaded thus not contributing to them getting even more overloaded, however with no mechanism in place for showing when this is the case its pretty much impossible for a buyer to know at what point he becomes part of the problem.<br /><br />Vendors: Vendors can stop overselling when they&#039;re either out of Product or simply can&#039;t meet the increased demand. Unfortunately Vendors like MailPharma who realize they have way too much demand and step down temporarily are far and in between. The majority will mark in transit and not ship for days etc. as they have a massive work load, this is simply a case of if the Vendor has the capability to self-regulate and as we can clearly see most can&#039;t or simply won&#039;t as they&#039;re making bank off it.<br /><br />Silk Road: Silk Road currently only provides the mechanism of marking a letter as in transit or cancelling it without being able to give any reasons, and that&#039;s pretty much it. Needless to say these two options aren&#039;t up to the task in terms of helping to solve this problem.<br />----------<br />Now it might somehow be possible to solve this problem by utilizing the perspective of a buyer or Vendor, but I don&#039;t see how that would be possible. From the perspective of Silk Road however I would hypothetically suggest the following possible solutions:<br /><br />* Offer more options on Shipping Options, one could for example be something like &quot;I&#039;m currently overloaded - I accept your order but it will be shipped late, you will have the ability to cancel this order at any time until the time I have marked this order in some other category&quot;.<br />* Provide an option of setting a Max Order active at any one time. For example I could set the number to 50, go to sleep when number of orders is 0 and when I wake up I might have 50 orders and no more since the system has automatically stopped taking in more orders after that amount. Alternatively the orders after 50 could be marked as the previous suggestion as &quot;Overloaded&quot; while all others before it are treated &quot;normally&quot;.<br />* As a sub-function to the suggestions above, one could put certain products in prioritized states where they might be able to go over the 50 limit or not count at all as they&#039;re so easy to package compared to other products etc., in short it could be highly customizable.<br />* Allow Buyers to see if a Vendor has approached this Daily Limit, if not by numbers at least by a Yes or No and warn the Buyer that if he orders from that Vendor after in this case 50 orders his order will be marked as &quot;Overloaded&quot;, want to proceed anyway?
