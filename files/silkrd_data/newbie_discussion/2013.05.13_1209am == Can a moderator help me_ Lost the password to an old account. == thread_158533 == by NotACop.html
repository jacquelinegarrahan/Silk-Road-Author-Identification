				I lost the password to my previous account, which had around 500-600 posts.<br /><br />Got really fucked up one night and was absolutely sure the police was going to come the very next day and raid my house and that they already had my SR passwords and everything. (It&#039;s retarded, but drugs do tend to make you paranoid) So I changed them all. And I made up such good passwords, that I forgot the one to my forum account.<br /><br />Is there any way I can get it back?

				I&#039;m sorry but there is no way to get it back if you&#039;ve lost or forgotten the password.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; If this was happening with your main SR account, then you could get the password reset, but for forum accounts, you would just need to start a new one (like you&#039;ve done).&nbsp; Sorry for the inconvenience - wish I could do more to help.&nbsp; I&#039;ll double check with DPR just to be sure that there&#039;s no way to recover it for you.

				Okay - sent off a quick short message and I&#039;ll keep this thread open so I can come back and give you an update as soon as I hear back.

				Just heard back from DPR and he confirmed that you *will* need to start a new forum account as there is no way to recover a lost forum account.

				That is true, fair enough :)<br /><br />For all we know, cops could be doing these things to find out more stuff xD<br /><br />And since i&#039;m definitely NOT a cop, I say good thinking!
