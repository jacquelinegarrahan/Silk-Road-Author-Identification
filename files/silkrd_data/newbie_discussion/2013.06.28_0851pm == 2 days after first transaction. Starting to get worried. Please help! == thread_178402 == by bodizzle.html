				Hey everyone.<br /><br />So am obviously new to SR. 2 days ago I ordered (wednesday) , usps express, from a very reputable vendor on here. Usps express is guaranteed 2 days, but 80% of the time is overnight. It is now past that time today.<br /><br />I have written the vendor multiple times asking for them to check to see the package has arrived on their end (not asking for the tracking number or anything). No reply.<br /><br />There was a small 20 minute window I was not around today, there is a tiny tiny chance I missed the delivery. The address I had it shipped to has a lobby where the door is usually open where the usps people just leave it on front podium, but today for some reason front door was locked during that 20 minute window. But there was no slip left by usps saying they missed a dropoff. <br /><br />I am starting to get concerned that maybe the package was seized and I am now worrying about my safety somewhat. <br /><br />Has anyone else had problems with USPS express mail? What was the end result? How should I approach the vendor on this and what is appropriate for them to do?

				Bro i highly doubt the package was seized. I can tell your very new to having parcels come from SR. Are you sure he even shipped it? Just cause you put the order in doesnt mean it was shipped Wednesday. Did it say &quot;In transit&quot; that day? The vendor should reply to you regardless, but if you got one of the Top vendors by chance they could be busy.<br /><br />Were you asked to FE?&nbsp;

				You&#039;ll be okay. If the package ever shows up just don&#039;t accept it if your that concerned. And heck even if you do accept it, if it isn&#039;t something major in it you&#039;ll just be looking at a slap on the wrist most likely. Also, keep quite let a lawyer do all the talking. Deny, deny, deny. Good luck man.

				The vendor did message me once after it turned to &quot;in transit&quot; to tell me it had shipped that day (wednesday). <br /><br />No, I was not asked nor did I FE.<br /><br />@420 dreams: It was 1g of coke. Dont think thats a slap on the wrist. A felony I believe yes? <br /><br />Are you thinking it could have actually been seized and they are setting up a controlled delivery? Or am I just going nuts over nothing and theyre might have just been shipping problems? (delayed flights etc..) But this was only express domestic, it is quite quite odd... <br /><br />Is it ok for me to accept it if they dont ask for a signature?

				If you really fear it&#039;s a controlled delivery, don&#039;t accept it and take it as a loss. Or take your chances, accept it but don&#039;t open it. That way if they bust down your door they will find the package unopened and you can say you had no idea what was in it.

				The vendor should have waived the Sig. It should of been there today, Keep trying to get in touch with the vendor tonight. But like i said i highly doubt anything is wrong as far as them setting up a controlled delivery over 1 gram of coke. Yea its a federal offense on top of a drug felony but still its just a gram. Iv been here a year with over 50 packages from all around the world and never a issue.<br /><br />You do need to see whats up by the vendor. Maybe there was no where to leave the package so they took it back an are gonna re try tomorrow.

				There is a really good read about CD&#039;s (that&#039;s Controlled Deliveries for fellow Newbies) &quot;stickied&quot; in the Shipping section, titled: Topic: Profiling postal package 101 straight from the feds.&nbsp; Worth the read.<br /><br />Anyway, a CD is no small task, many people are involved behind the scenes, not to mention getting a search warrant to search your premises after you take delivery.&nbsp; That&#039;s really why they want you to take the package, it allows them probable cause to search your home, computer, etc.<br /><br />However, I highly doubt they&#039;re going to jump through all those hoops for a measly 1 gram of coke for an individual user.&nbsp; No, they are targeting the bigger time resellers and dealers to make it worth the effort.&nbsp; And anyway, a vendor worth his salt should be able to easily stealth ship such a small quantity like that.<br /><br />I could be wrong, maybe LE would do a CD for 50 pills of oxy, or a few joints, or 1 gram of coke, but I got to believe they&#039;d rather spend the energy getting a much bigger fish that won&#039;t be able to walk so easily with a competent lawyer.

				Thanks for the replies guys but, Ack im still confused&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />If the delivery does happen to come tommorrow without me getting in touch with the vendor, should I just accept it and write return to sender on the package? How does that work? There is no real mailbox to leave it in at the address I had it delivered to, just a front podium where the mail is left. I guess I would leave it there for the usps person to see it so they can pick it up and take it away the next day? <br /><br />My confusion is in regards to, what if its just usps error and they drop it, and its just sitting there waiting to open up tomorrow? No signature, nothing. Just the package sitting there quietly. In that case, if no signature was involved, I would just let it sit and wait a couple days to see if the LE comes?<br /><br />There was no slip left, but do you guys think maybe that was an error on the postman&#039;s part and it could be waiting at the postal facility? In that case, I should most definitely *NOT* go in and pick it up, as it requires showing ID. Am I correct on this?<br /><br />I really hate being in the dark here. I really wish the vendor would get back to me. I really appreciate everyone&#039;s feedback!<br /><br />*one final thing: Is it possible to leave vendor feedback on their page without transaction finalization?

Also now that i read a little more about the story an where u had it deliverd, im almost sure there is no CD or anything your in trouble for. It sounds Like they had No where to leave the mail!! <br /><br />You need to be watching for the mail man in the AM to see if he has it. Im sure if its a USA vendor he waived the Sig. Almost every vendor i know waves the sig for Domestic shipments.<br /><br />Also what i meant about RETURN TO SENDER, iS when your giving the mail take it like you would anytime, Its just a Normal mail day right? Go to your apt, or house , But dont open the package, write RTS on it. Just let it sit overnight at the house with you. The reason the return to sender is writtin is In case something came up, you can say &quot; I didnt know who that parcel was from so i planned on having it sent back&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Its just something to help you out if the worst were to come..<br /><br />I dont mean trully try to return it to sender (The vendor) You should really read up on all this stuff. But again it sounds more like the Mail man Had no where to leave the mail or no one to give it to.

				I sent it to a work address, its a super small place and I know everyone there. We usually leave the front door to the lobby open, which is where the postmen leave packages/mail. A bunch of other employees there have stuff delivered there as well, so I didnt think it would be a problem.<br /><br />As far as the name, I took advice from another forum member and just mispelled my name a bit, like if it was some mass mail sent out by a computer. I dont know if this was a bad idea or not, but the last name on the package is real, just the first name mispelled a little.. <br /><br />I really need the vendor to get in touch with me, as my anxiety is getting pretty high here.<br />

				@anonymousaddict, thanks for your reply.<br /><br />Well, I was working the two days it was planned for delivery and I know the lobby was open during all delivery times except that 20 minute period. The mailmen always know where to leave packages in the front as we have had many many employees get packages there.<br /><br />Also, if the package is at the postal facility, I should *definitely* not go pick it up right?

				Yo honestly I&#039;m having a hard time just reading your posts, homie lol you&#039;re tweaking out!<br /><br />Really though it&#039;s no big deal. USPS sucks sometimes. It probably got stuck somewhere under some box and you&#039;ll get it tomorrow or something. They can fuck up too. <br /><br />I&#039;d wait another day or two before asking for a reship from the vendor and stuff. Let us know if it comes in tomorrow though.<br /><br />and I am pretty sure all express packages have a tracking number or something so ask the vendor what&#039;s up with it. If he doesn&#039;t answer he&#039;s either busy or not a good vendor and you should take your biz somewhere else. But I never misspell my name and I&#039;d never ship my drugs to work lol just my opinion though.
