				Not sure yet, just getting back into it. Have what I think is about a 60% sativa. It comes up nice but can be a little edgy. It does mellow out into a nice calm buzz after a while though. Makes for nice walks in the woods, etc. Can smoke quite a bit and not get tired at all, but sleep like a baby at night after using.

				i think i have probably responded to 100 &quot;favorite pot strain&quot; threads and have given 100 different answers lol <br />lately i have been smoking strains that are mostly or fully indica<br />but my life changed when someone gave me a hash oil vapor bong a couple months ago lmao&nbsp; :D i had never seen one before or even knew these things existed. can always get very high quality hash oil by the baby food jar but bitched regularly about having to spread it on paper to roll joints, the fucking shit sticks everywhere, paper is stuck all over the place, its a mess lol then someone bought me a bong with an attachment that you heat up with a torch lighter, use a dabber and dab it in the oil, touch the oil dabber on the torch heated attachment and smoking like a regular bong and BANG a huge fucking hit of oil. its such a big thick hit too. it gets me stoned as shit off 1 dab. the oil is made out of purple kush. honestly 1 baby jar is never ending now. theres probably like a million dabs in there. so i guess my favorite strain right now is purple kush (oil) and this cool oil vapor bong
