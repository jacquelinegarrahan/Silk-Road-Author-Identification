				Notice to Young Men 18 to 30 by Peter Andrew Nolan<br />Originally posted here: http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/93/postid/6148/scope/posts/Default.aspx#6148<br /><br />Note: This is also dictated into a video and available from here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZxUtzMOv-o<br /><br />A notice to young men from 18 to 30. <br /><br />This is a notice to all English speaking young men in the age range 18 to 30 in the “western world”. This includes places like USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia, New Zealand. <br /><br />As a brief introduction my calling is Peter-Andrew: Nolan©. I am also known as Joschua-Brandon: Boehm©. You can find out a little bit about me from this video.<br /><br />A01 - Introduction (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT0dafZAfb0)<br /><br />I have released quite a bit of video materials to educate young men just like you. We even have our own education channel as follows:<br /><br />Forum for the MBA Education Channel (http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/453/scope/threads/Default.aspx)<br /><br />I have decided to script this video so that I can be precise and clear in this video. I will say what I mean and mean what I say. You can make of it what you will. <br /><br />About a year ago I completed my second book. It was dedicated to young men 16 to 30. I called it &quot;The Truth Be Told&quot;. The reason I called it by that name is that young men have been lied to since the day they were born. Just like I was lied to since the day I was born. If there is one thing that has really pissed me off over the last 6 years or so it has been the realisation that almost EVERYONE lied to me since the day I was born. Many of the MEN who lied to me did so unknowingly, so they can not be too harshly blamed. <br /><br />However the VAST MAJORITY of women who lied to me did so with malice of forethought. And that includes my own grand mothers, mother and aunts. These women lied to my face. They knew they were lying when they did so. This is not excusable and I refuse to excuse them for their betrayal. These women knew the true nature of women and they lied to me about women so as to sell me a faulty bill of goods when I was too young to know what it was I was buying. I was lied to by people I loved and respected and truly believed had my best interests at heart. It is these women, the women of my extended family, that have been so instrumental in motivating me to tell you young men what women are really like.<br /><br />Now. You can download the book from this link. I recommend you read it. It might just save your life. If you see this link and you refuse to click on it and you refuse to read The Truth Be Told? Don&#039;t come whining to me if you get your life destroyed by some woman. Ok? <br />The Truth Be Told Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3FPpCqDW4)<br />The Truth Be Told Book (http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=hNKVd0Hr7bU=&amp;tabid=753&amp;mid=1703)<br /><br />Now. I will not assume you have read this book or watch this video. I will assume that you WILL watch the video or read the book at some point in time in the future if you are going to go on and learn how to live in freedom.<br /><br />I want to address one of the most important issues for you young men. Something that you are very well advised to &quot;get&quot; and understand. <br /><br />You have been betrayed. <br /><br />Yes. You read that correctly. You have been betrayed. Most importantly you have been betrayed by your fathers and your grand fathers. <br /><br />Sure, you have also been betrayed by your sisters, your mothers and your grand mothers. But they are women. They are not honest. They have no honour and they have no integrity in the 99.9% majority. You can not expect women to not betray you. Betrayal is a mainstay of&nbsp; the female nature. The vast majority of western women will betray even their husbands. All the other WW will look on and support and condone a woman betraying her husbands faith and trust. <br /><br />If you are a young man and you do not know that women will betray a man at the drop of a hat and all the other women will agree? Just go talk to some men who have been divorced.<br /><br />For example? In my case I had not long before inspired my 26 year old son to fight for his life when stricken with cancer. Not even his own mother could inspire him to fight for his own life. That task came down to me. Even though I had just been instrumental in saving her own sons life she betrayed me. Even though I had just been instrumental in saving HIS life my own step-son betrayed me. This is what it is like to be a man and a father now. <br /><br />When my close friends were telling me &quot;Jennifer is going to lie to you and betray you&quot; I would say &quot;After all I have done for her there is no way she is going to betray me or betray my trust. And even if she did? Her father and mother will come down on my side because they have known me since I was 12 and know the sort of man I am.&quot;<br /><br />So if my wife can betray me and virtually ALL the WW who were around her support her in her betrayal? You young men are very well advised to learn from that experience and know that ANY woman can betray ANY man and ALL the other women will see that as being just fine and dandy. Yet you ALL KNOW how women HATE on men who betray a woman. <br /><br />So yes. Your women will betray you at the drop of a hat. You should NEVER trust ANY woman, EVER, with ANYTHING. If women do not like me saying that? THEY are the ones who should address the betrayals of women so as to start the long and arduous process of restoring their own credibility.<br /><br />But your fathers? Your grand fathers? Their betrayal of you is not forgivable and you are well advised to never, ever forgive them. There will be a few lucky ones among you who have good fathers and grand fathers who have not betrayed you. But that will surely be the &quot;lucky few&quot;. Less than 1% of you will have fathers and grand fathers who have not betrayed you.<br /><br />So I want to talk about this betrayal of your fathers and grand fathers for a while. <br /><br />Three generations ago. Men who would be in their 90s to 110 years of age were they to be alive today fought in WW II. My step grand father, Frank Trainor, was one of those men who fought and was lucky enough to survive. When I was about 14 he sat me down and he told me some stories of his mates, his fallen comrades. He did not tell me these stories as examples of &quot;glory&quot;. It was very hard for him to tell me these stories because he relived those times as he told them. <br /><br />He told me of men who died next to him while he was spared. He told me stories of men who, fatally wounded, had to be left to bleed out slowly. He told me how the small jungle animals and flies would start eating their flesh even before they were dead. How the men, too weak to even move, knew they were being eaten by rats and mice and flies, and simply accepted this was their fate. To die in some foreign land having done the best they could do to protect the people of their homelands.<br /><br />He made the point that when he and his mates were fighting in the jungles across south east asia my parents were little children. My father being born in 1937 and my mother in 1939. He made the point that should it ever be my turn to do my bit then I must not dis-honour the memory of his fallen comrades. I must, like them, fight to the death to defend my loved ones and the people of my land. This is the message he passed to me. The message from his fallen comrades. That my parents had a great life because they were willing to fight and die. That I would have a chance of a great life because his comrades were willing to fight and die.<br /><br />The men of my grand fathers generation, the men of your great grand fathers generation, fought and died in large numbers to give your grand fathers generation, my fathers generation, a better chance in life. And what did your grand fathers and fathers do? The men of my fathers generation and my generation? They took the benefits of that chance themselves and then squandered it for their own children, the men of YOUR generation.<br /><br />As you can see if you check into my background I am now 49. My father is 75 soon to be 76. My former step children are 32 and 31. My alleged children are soon to be 22 and 20. I know that of which I speak. Men of my fathers generation and my generation &quot;fell asleep at the wheel&quot;. We were told there was a &quot;cold war&quot; and an &quot;external enemy&quot; and we fell for it. All the while traitors from within slowly introduced a tyranny that was hard to distinguish. Hard to understand.<br /><br />These traitors, who so loudly proclaim how hard they are working for us and how much they care about us, have been building the preparations for a police state that will make Communist Russia and China look like picnics. These traitors are called Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.&nbsp; There are others called Doctors and Psychologists and Priests and Ministers but they are less important and are having less influence than the Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.<br /><br />I &quot;blew the whistle&quot; on these criminals in 2008. I was gathering up evidence for the criminality of these collaborators and developing a remedy so that you, the next generation, could live in freedom and peace and prosperity. When I finally delivered that remedy in November 2009 and proved it in the Australian Federal Magistrates Court I expected your fathers and your grand fathers to rally and work with me to put an end to the criminal cartel known as &quot;guvments&quot; around the world.<br /><br />But a funny thing happened. Something that shocked me at the time. Your fathers and your grand fathers refused to work with me to stop the coming tyranny. They flatly refused. And the #1 reason they refused was &quot;the guvment might hurt me&quot;. <br /><br />I would tell them: &quot;It is certainly true that the guvment might hurt you. But the only reason you have ANYTHING that can be taken from you by your own gvument is because men died for you. Your fathers and your grand fathers died in the worlds bloodiest war so that you might have the chance to live in freedom. Now? When that very freedom is under threat again you are not willing to step up to the level of your fathers and grand fathers? You are not willing to do for your sons and grand sons what your fathers and grand fathers did for you?&quot;<br /><br />The answer has proven to be a resounding &quot;Yes. We are not willing to do for others what was done for us. The next generation can sort it out for themselves.&quot;<br /><br />I recall in late 2010 I flew over to Ireland to meet with the leadership of the Irish Freeman Site. My colleague and I put it to them that if their children and grand children are to live in freedom then they must stand up to their guvment and create new courts of law. The men said no. One among them was a new grand father. His grandson was a tiny baby. Just a few weeks old I was led to believe. So I asked him. &quot;You are a grand father. What are your plans? What will you do?&quot; His answer was &quot;When they come to my door I will take a few of them with me.&quot; <br /><br />So I asked him &quot;What about your grandson who is not able to defend himself?&quot;<br /><br />And his answer was &quot;He will have to look after himself.&quot;<br /><br />I looked at the man long and hard. I really, really eyeballed him. I finally said. &quot;That is your answer? You refuse to defend your grand son with everything you have?&quot; He did not break eye contact with me and just said &quot;Yes&quot;.<br /><br />There was nothing more to say. This came from an Irish Man. This came from a man who had lived in Freedom because of the Irish Men who fought the British. And here he was, willing to go eyeball to eyeball with me and tell me he would not do the same for his grand son. <br /><br />In that moment I saw that betrayal of the grand children is now acceptable for grand fathers and fathers alike.<br /><br />I can tell you. I was not very happy with that man. But he must make his own choices. <br /><br />I have talked to 10,000 such men, if not 100,000 such men. I do not know how many men of my generation, 49, and my fathers generation, 74, I have talked to because I have put posts into public spaces that could be read by any number of people.<br /><br />The message I can give to you young men of 18 to 30 is this. Your grand fathers and fathers are not going to help you. They are not going to work against the introduction of the tyranny that is coming for your benefit. They are openly condoning and supporting the introduction of the New World Order. They want you enslaved. They want you to be paying taxes in the future to pay for their &quot;welfare benefits&quot;. The vast majority of them are fully aware that there is a tyranny being introduced. The thousands that I talk to refuse to pass along the word of the coming tyranny pretending &quot;I don&#039;t believe you so I will not pass the word along&quot; when they know full well what is going on. They say they don&#039;t. But they absolutely know.<br /><br />They are betraying you because they know what is coming and they are doing nothing to stop it.<br /><br />Now. Just before I go into the next section I want to share with you something of my life because you might not read it in my books and it is important to this presentation. <br /><br />I have had a charmed life. Many people tell lies about me and say I am &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;bitter&quot; or any of a whole bunch of other lies. I was telling one of the boys I grew up next door to the other day that &quot;if I ever complained about my life you should just slap me one because I have had a better life than just about anyone else I know. Very few men get to live a life like me.&quot;<br /><br />I won the DNA lottery when it came to God handing out brains. Such is life. I got lucky. I was dux of my high school and I was awarded a scholarship for physics at the Australian National University. I turned it down because I had started my first job as a trainee programmer for a large company in Australia called Australian Iron and Steel. I was assigned to the programming team for the Plate Mill. This was the mill that made flat steel plate for things like ships, oil rigs, flooring in buildings, pipelines and the like. <br /><br />Of course, in 1982, deciding to be a software developer was a very risky decision. No one had any idea that software development was going to become the industry it became. We were paid pittances in those days and seen as &quot;propeller heads&quot;. We were much hated by the men on the factory floor as they saw us as taking their jobs off them with automation. A view they had much justification in having by the way.<br /><br />In 1985 IBM came to our university campus. I decided to go for a campus interview. I was dressed in my usual leathers for riding my motorbike which took the interviewer aback. I also had the requisite long hair and beard that university students have. He said that &quot;We at IBM are looking for the best of the best. We are looking for people who are great at what they do and know they are great at what they do.&quot; I told him that he was looking for me then. I told him I was the top programmer in my year at the university and the top programmer in my intake year for Australian Iron and Steel. I was very self confident. Something that less capable people like to call arrogant. People of lesser capability like to try and slur people of greater capability with the term &quot;arrogant&quot;. People of great capability almost NEVER use the word &quot;arrogant&quot; of anyone. If the person has the goods we admire them. If they do not have the goods but pretend they do we pity them because that is a terrible way to live.<br /><br />I got the job at IBM and I went into the International Software Development Centre in Sydney in 1986. I did my first overseas trip in November 1986. It was only to New Zealand but it was a start. Next year, in 1987, I went to Hong Kong for three months for IBM. I was asked to go straight on to Thailand for another two months but I was sick and I was burned out. In 88 I went to Malaysia for 8 weeks. My then fiancée finally put her foot down and demanded I quit the long trips. I did a few weeks in Taiwan to hand over my job and took a new job that did not require so much travel to placate my then fiancée. Big mistake by the way lads. If a woman EVER gives you an ultimatum like &quot;stop travelling or I will leave you&quot; then you MUST say &quot;Then go now, get out.&quot;&nbsp; Never, EVER give in to a woman&#039;s &quot;ultimatum&quot;. EVER. She will hate you for your weakness.<br /><br />I spent many years not travelling. But Jennifer was wasteful of money. She also quit work. So in 1996 I took a job at Hitachi Data Systems. One of the reasons they could not fill the position was the level of travel that would be required. The role was for the Business Development Manager for Asia Pacific for Business Intelligence. This would require massive amounts of travel going around Asia Pacific giving presentations to HDS customers so as to launch the Business Intelligence Practice. It was also a well paid position and I had four children and a wife to feed. So I took the job and told Jennifer she had no choice about the travel as she was refusing to work.<br />

				PART 2<br /><br />From then on, 1996, I have travelled extensively for my work. I would have to sit down and try and recall all the countries I have worked in. But it is likely to be well more than 20 by now. I have worked on all continents except South America. I have worked in at least 200 companies across those 20 countries. I have had dream contracts and I have had some pretty bad contracts. But more than anything else I have had a life experience that few get to enjoy. Many people outright disbelieve me when I talk about my life. They just say &quot;No one ever got to live a life like that, not even presidents and kings!&quot;<br /><br />Well? I did get to live a life like that. I am not a president and not a king. I have lived a life blessed in so many ways that I can only think of one lad I grew up with who could realistically say he did better than me. And that would be Mark Taylor,&nbsp; the former Australian cricket captain. Mark and I played cricket together and against each other in school. His sister was in my class so we knew each other pretty well at school. He was good at cricket at school but no one would have picked him as ever making it to being an opening batsman for Australia.<br /><br />One of the incidents that marked Mark for greatness was this. One day we were playing on opposing teams. I was captain of my&nbsp; team but I was ill and unable to take the field. Mark was on 98 and going for his hundred. Our bowler managed to get one to cut back a little bit and beat the edge of the bat and rapped him on the pads. My dad was umpiring and gave him out leg before wicket. <br /><br />Mark came over to me and said &quot;You can tell your father later that he didn&#039;t have to give me out, he could have let me get my hundred.&quot;<br /><br />So I asked him. &quot;Well, were you out?&quot;<br /><br />And he said &quot;Sure, I was out, and I deserved to go, but I really would have liked to have gotten my hundred.&quot;<br /><br />The VAST MAJORITY of other lads would have denied being out and been a bit angry about the situation. But young Mark was quite willing to admit the ball beat him. He was going for one of his standard off drives, a shot he had even at that time, and the ball was a little close to the body to be doing that and got a bit of movement back and so there was no question in Marks mind that the ball was going to hit the stumps and he was &quot;man enough&quot; at 14 to admit that.<br /><br />It marked him as an honest lad. <br /><br />So many years later when Mark was on 334 overnight against India, the equal highest score by an Australian next to the greatest ever Donald Bradman and Sid Barnes, and there was much speculation in the media about whether, as captain, he would decide to bat for 10 minutes to break the record or whether he would declare overnight. Knowing Mark there was never a question in my mind. He would declare overnight so as to give his team the best chance of bowling out the Indians. <br /><br />So I am more than willing to concede that Mark Taylor, former Australian Cricket Captain, opening batsman and cricketing great had a better life than I did.&nbsp; His headline statistics are as follows: &quot;In 104 Test matches, he scored 7,525 runs with a batting average of 43.49, including 19 centuries and 40 fifties.&quot;<br /><br />But after Mark? Of the lads who were in my peer group in the schools around my area? Some made more money than me, sure. Some have in tact families, sure. But I don&#039;t know anyone else who raised four children, travelled the world, and made it to the top of his profession in something so mundane as Information Technology. <br /><br />The point I want to emphasis to you young men is this. Those men who died next to my step grand father? Those men who bled out in the jungles across south east asia? Those men who never saw their 21st birthday in many cases and were rarely older than 25? Those young men died fighting for what they believed in. As a result I got to live a great life. A life almost unequalled even in my own time. Only the very luckiest or most talented get to live a life like I have lived. <br /><br />I owe those men a debt of honour. I owe them a debt that I can never repay. There is only one way to repay the debt of men who fought and died for you. That is to be the guardian of what they fought and died for. Liberty. Freedom. The chance of a better life for those left behind. I got that chance that was paid for with their lives. It is my obligation to my step grand fathers fallen comrades to be the guardian of the liberty and opportunity they died for.<br /><br />This is why, as soon as I realised that the judge dealing with my family law case in Ireland was a criminal that I realised that there was something very, very wrong in the whole system of guvment. I had to deal with first things first and disown my former children, go through my suicidal period and come out the other side. But once I had made it through being suicidal and had come out the other side in May 2008 I made a very conscious choice to go into battle with these criminals for the benefit of others, particularly young men just like you. To defend those who were too young or not well informed enough to defend themselves.<br /><br />There is a saying on 4CHAN. It is &quot;we are not your private army&quot;. I was asking my friend John Rambo what that means because, being 49, I believed it likely had meaning I did not understand. John explained to me that it means that though there might be a lot of young men on 4chan they see themselves as not being obliged in any way to help out anyone else. They are &quot;no mans private army&quot; to be doing things for other men. That is what he told me, be it true or false.<br /><br />My question to that is this. &quot;Why not?&quot; <br /><br />I have been, for five years, a one man &quot;private army&quot; doing battle with the powers that be, the Illuminati, for the benefit of others. I most certainly did not do it for myself. It would have been much safer and much easier to just have my ex, Jennifer, killed and to move on with my life. But that would only have served me. It would not have served all the other fathers and it would not have served the millions of young men around the word whose futures have been sold down the toilet by their fathers and grand fathers.<br /><br />If you, as a young man, take the position, &quot;I am no mans private army&quot; meaning that you will never stand up for your brother when he has been criminally victimised or is in need of help then under the law &quot;do unto others&quot; you can&#039;t expect your brother to stand up for you. That is how life is. If you want someone to do something for you then you either pay them or you do for others what you expect back from them. It is quite simple.<br /><br />Now. I have spent 5 years working through this process. In 2009 I started the call to your fathers and grand fathers for the creation of common law courts. In Australia we proclaimed new common law courts into existence on April 15th 2011. And yet? Your fathers and your grand fathers are so cowardly they are not willing to sit on the juries of these courts and run these courts as open and transparent courts citing &quot;fear of the guvment&quot; if they do. <br /><br />And those lads who bled out in the jungle in WW II? What would be happing in your land now if those men who died in WW II refused to fight because they were &quot;fearful of getting hurt&quot;? Australians would be speaking Japanese. British would be speaking German. Right? You get my meaning. That men were willing to fight and die to defend liberty and freedom, as they believed they were doing, places a burden of responsibility on those who follow to guard those freedoms so hard won.<br /><br />Your fathers and your grand fathers will not do this in any number. You can go and ask them yourselves to join us on CAF and MBA if you want. Please. Go ask them. Get their &quot;no&quot; to your face. Have them betray you right to your face like my father betrayed me right to my face. I would encourage you to do that so that you can look your father and/or grand father in the eye as he lies to you and betrays you. It will hurt more but it will be clearer for you what you might do next.<br /><br />And what MIGHT you do next?<br /><br />Well? I would ask. Why are you NOT your brothers personal army when he has been criminally victimised or is in need of your help? Why would you leave your brother to fend for himself when he is out of his depth?<br /><br />When I was young there was a very popular song in Australia by a man named Rolf Harris. It was called &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;. You can listen to it and read the lyrics here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QscvXkYQAek<br /><br />The story is basically two little boys are playing with their toy horses. One lad has an accident and his horses head falls off. As he is crying for his broken toy his friend says that he can share his horse and he can go just as fast with two. So the lad is happy again. Long years pass and they are both on the battlefield. The little boy who was the one who helped gets wounded and is dying on the battlefield and needs to be rescued. Of course, who comes to his rescue is the lad who he had helped out and shown kindness to all those years before.<br /><br />For us Australian lads this song epitomised our Australian ideal of &quot;mateship&quot; that we had in the 60s, 70s and 80s. You never let your mates down. If your mate needs help you help. He should not even have to ask if you are a &quot;good mate&quot;. I was raised to always keep my eye out on those around me and notice if anyone was in distress or trouble where they needed some help. I was raised to go and offer that help unasked. If I was turned down that would be fine. 99% of the time I have offered my help to someone across the years it has been accepted as the offer of kindness and concern that it was.<br /><br />Somewhere in the 90s and 00s this ideal of &quot;mateship&quot; disappeared from the Australian way of life. We, Australians, for whatever reason, no longer come to the aid of a man in need. We leave him to his fate. We will still help &quot;women and children&quot;, but the vast majority of people in Australia and Ireland will not help men. Men have been relegated to 4th class citizens behind women, children and DOGS. You lads would do well to know this. <br /><br />Australian men, for their own part, became quite impossible to actually help. The very need for help seems to be &quot;offensive&quot; to them. They have had this idea that &quot;macho&quot; or &quot;manly&quot; means to &quot;never be in need of help&quot;. This, of course, is ludicrous. We all need a hand every now and then no matter who we are. The old beatles song of &quot;I Get By With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; comes to mind. <br /><br />When you do offer help to Australian men now they do not accept the help offered which is generally the help needed. They prefer instead to demand support that is not of any earthly use to them and seem determined to refuse to understand the position in which they are in. It beggars belief but that is 99% of the men I have tried to assist over the last few years in the area of family law. <br /><br />It has actually been so impossible to help Australian fathers that I have had to refuse to help them any more out of my own time and out of my own pocket. They simply parasite off any man who is willing to do such and then do not join in the fight once they are back on their feet in the vast majority. Of course, there are exceptions but they are actually quite rare. The very fact that it has taken more than THREE YEARS to assemble 180 or so men willing to sit on new juries in new courts in Australia you can see the issue at hand.<br /><br />The next step, of running a court and getting a guilty verdict, is going to lead to the position where there is a need to seize the property of a guilty party and hand it to the victim of their crime(s) so as to remedy the crimes. If your fathers and grand fathers have been too cowardly in the main to create new courts how do you think they will go seizing property?<br /><br />This leaves you young men with a decision to make about your futures. Will you return to the values of &quot;mateship&quot; and &quot;brotherhood&quot;? Will you help your brother in need? Or will you, like your fathers and grand fathers, leap tall buildings in a single bound to help a woman with a broken fingernail while leaving your brother to lay bleeding to death on the battlefield?<br /><br />What is at stake is no less than your future. As I said. I am 49. I have had a great life already. I will never have grand children now. There is not that much to look forward to other than more of the same great lifestyle I have had over the last 25 years. Only now I am free to date much younger and much more attractive women than be with my overweight and over 50 ex wife. My life is great. I am going to keep doing it until my maker calls me. Having been suicidal I see every day above ground as a great bonus. I am going to enjoy every minute of it. <br /><br />But you, young man? How is your life? What are your prospects? If you live in the western English speaking world? You are far more likely to have poor prospects for your life. You will likely have been betrayed in school by your female teachers. You are likely to have been deprived of the education that your fathers paid taxes for as the &quot;needs of the girls&quot; were put in front of your needs. <br /><br />With blatant discrimination against men in universities very few of you would have gotten a degree. Very few of you would have been able to secure a job at a large firm like I did at IBM. The vast majority of you will not have a prayer of living a life like I have lived these last 25 years. John Rambo has described to me in great detail what the world looks like for a &quot;twenty something man&quot; in the western English speaking world. And it is not good. If you add to that the efforts of your guvments to get World War 3 started? Who do you young men think are going to be the primary victims of World War 3 if they get it started? Who do you think is going to be the primary victims of the civil wars they are trying to start?<br /><br />Here is a hint. NOT your fathers and grandfathers. Those traitors are going to try and sell YOU on going to war to DEFEND THEM. The very men who are too gutless to sit on a jury to secure your rights will demand YOU DIE to secure their safety. <br /><br />You might want to think about that.<br /><br />So. Let&#039;s say you now understand that you have pretty poor prospects. What can YOU do about it? <br /><br />Well? I have been YOUR PERSONAL ARMY for five years now. I have worked my butt off to try and re-introduce the rule of law into Ireland and Australia and then help other men from there on as and when possible. I risked my life to do so. I spent 4,000+ hours and USD500,000 of my own money. I asked your fathers and your grand fathers to stand up to criminal women and criminal guvments and re-introduce the rule of law. We have some small number of such men. But we are going to need more men who are willing to act in roles like Peace Officers, Private Investigators and Jury Members. <br /><br />So the invitation I am extending to young men is to join the Mens Business Association and volunteer for those roles. These are the links you can use.<br />http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com<br />http://www.mbaposervices.com<br />http://www.mbapiservices.com

				LAST PART<br /><br />As you can see. Your fathers and grand fathers are not signing up to be Peace Officers or Private Investigators in the new economy we are building. They are too gutless and cowardly to do so. They falsely believe &quot;the police&quot; are there to help them. I find such wilful delusion to be quite ludicrous. <br /><br />You can see from the links below and the lack of response by Police Officers.&nbsp; Police Officers are NOT willing to be Peace Officers at least in Australia and Ireland. And the same is likely true for other countries. Feel free to taker a look at these two videos that have been passed to Police Officers in Ireland and Australia. I have noticed the Police in Ireland and Australia in 2011. Both lots of Police have made their intentions clear. They are siding with the guvment. They intend that you men live in a police state where they get to be your slave masters. You might want to object to that.<br />D78 - Statement to Australian Police Officers (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsnS1oyuuHE)<br />D80 - Statement to Irish Garda (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq87WojzBRs)<br /><br /><br />At the end of the day there is only one way for you young men to improve your prospects. That is to improve your prospects yourselves. For you to become the &quot;personal army&quot; of your brother. To come to your brothers aid when he is in need. To be willing to labour WITH your brother in co-operation and collaboration to create a future that is worth living in. Because I can tell you for sure and for certain, the future that your guvments have lined up for you is going to make it very questionable as to whether it is going to be one you want to live in.<br /><br />How do you improve your prospects? A lot of young men are expressing the desire to &quot;see the world burn&quot;. There is a nihilistic attitude expressed by many young men. It is very much along the lines of &quot;I was screwed over so I don&#039;t care if the world burns, I have my popcorn and a beer, I am going to watch it go up in flames.&quot; There is a certain level of justification in doing so. I can see why many young men would see it like that. You would see the obstacles as insurmountable. You see you have no leadership to show you how to improve your prospects. You see there are few men of my age and ability showing any real care or concern for you.<br /><br />But here is the thing. There are a few men like Bill Greathouse and I who would really like to see you men have better prospects in life. And not by being some wage slave for some greedy man who would kick you to the gutter as soon as he could. There is a future you can live into and create that will improve your prospects so that you can live a great life. That future is what we are building at the Mens Business Association.&nbsp; <br /><br />You want to see &quot;their&quot; world burn? You want to see &quot;them&quot; get their comeuppance? You want to see &quot;them&quot; get what they deserve? Well? You can do that if you want. <br /><br />How?<br /><br />By building a parallel economy and then taking away the businesses that &quot;they&quot; run one by one. The Unique Selling Proposition of businesses associated with the Mens Business Association will be that it is a man-friendly business. A business built by men to the benefit of men. They will be businesses you can offer your brother a job in. And he will labour honestly for his honest salary in return. <br /><br />All those other &quot;big businesses&quot; out there? They are pandering mostly to women employees and women customers. The sexual harassment lawsuits, the wrongful dismissal law suits? They are draining the energy and money from these businesses. I even saw an article today where a woman took IMDB to court claiming USD1,000,000 in damages for publishing her REAL AGE! Here is the link. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22120587<br /><br />If you young men can not out compete large companies that are weighed down with &quot;women employees&quot; and &quot;affirmative action&quot; then you do not deserve to be in business.<br /><br />I am proposing that men create their own businesses and they run them as effectively and efficiently as possible so as to out compete the established businesses. And by delivering better products and services at a better price with the Unique Selling Proposition to men that &quot;when you buy from us you are not paying the &quot;wimmiz equality&quot; tax&quot; you are very likely to be able to run successful businesses. And remember. Men do the VAST MAJORITY of useful work. We can persuade those men to join the MBA for the benefit of all men. We can persuade them not to compete with us directly. If they compete with us directly we can out compete them every time and put them out of business.<br /><br />The FIRST business us men must be in is the business of due process of law. This is why we have now launched MBA Law Services. You can listen to a detailed presentation about MBA Law Services on this link: A08 - Introducing MBA Law Services (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VjQnZhbInQ)<br /><br />I said above that you young men are considered 4th class citizens behind women, children and DOGS. This is true. In the current environment in the west a woman can make a false allegation and the cops are going to throw your arse in jail, period. Some young men have spent YEARS in jail for false rape allegations. The FIRST priority for you young men must be to re-introduce the rule of law so that you have the protection of the law from those older men who are betraying you.<br /><br />Think for example how many men in the US are in jail for non-crimes. For example, having in their possession some of Gods own produce? That is not a crime. It is only declared a crime and tolerated as being a crime that gets you young men thrown in jail by GUESS WHO? Your fathers and grand fathers. And evil men called &quot;politicians&quot;, &quot;judges&quot; and &quot;lawyers&quot;. While you young men do NOT serve as &quot;the private army&quot; of every other young man? While you stand alone rather than stand together? You will be easily picked off one at a time. Just like Chris Dorn was easily picked off.<br /><br />But if you co-operate and collaborate? If you stick together as soldiers? If you serve as the &quot;private army&quot; of every other young man out there? If you join us to provide an alternative system of law that is fair and just and SEEN to be fair and just? <br /><br />You can take away the advantage the guvment has in having a monopoly on courts, police and prisons. Since the VAST MAJORITY of men on the various police forces are young men just like yourselves? You can speak to them in their own language and tell them that oppressing you unlawfully is not longer going to be tolerated. <br /><br />In a free and open society there can be no monopolies. Most especially there can not be a monopoly on the due process of law. The people who live on the land decide what the law is. Guvments can only make legislation and that legislation only applies if you consent to it. I, personally, do not consent to any legislation.<br /><br />So the FIRST business we must create to be an alternative business to that those who have sold your future down the drain is the business of Law Services. If you young men just stop to think about how much money goes through the hands of lawyers, judges, magistrates, politicians, police and prisons? THAT is the FIRST business we can, AND MUST, gain a very large slice of. Enough of a slice so that no young man is criminally victimised by those who are trying to oppress you. Since there are so many criminals among that ranks of lawyers, judges, magistrates, politicians, police and prisons? We should be well able to kick start the MBA Law Services revenue stream by taking the property off those who are guilty of crimes according to LAWFUL decisions of juries of 12 men.<br /><br />All those young men who are in jails for non-crimes like carrying some of Gods own produce around need to be freed from their incarceration. We are well advised to create businesses to offer them jobs of some sort when they come out. The obvious jobs being things like Peace Officers, Private Investigators, Security Guards and similar. <br /><br />This is only going to happen if young men decide that they no longer wish to take the attitude &quot;I am no mans personal army&quot; to <br /><br />&quot;I am every young mans personal army because I will defend my brothers rights and he will defend mine&quot;.<br /><br />When you become your brothers &quot;personal army&quot; as I have been your personal army these last 5 years? As Bill Greathouse and John Rambo have been your personal army for years and years? Then YOU will have better prospects because YOUR future will not be able to be attacked and destroyed by the criminals in politics, the criminals in the legal fraternity, and the criminals in the police forces.<br /><br />Remember what the MBA is about. It is NOT about retribution or anything unlawful. Mens Business Association is about creating a LAWFUL second economy outside the jurisdiction of ANY gvument such that any man who chooses to can live in peace. This carries with it RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. If you want to be &quot;wet-nursed&quot; by the &quot;nanny state&quot; the MBA is not for you. The MBA is for &quot;go getters&quot; and &quot;self starters&quot;. It is for honest men of honour and integrity. It is for men who seek a better future for themselves, their brothers, their possible future children if they decide to have them.<br /><br />It is for the young men who can see they have been betrayed and are determined to create a better world to live their lives in. That is who the MBA is for. <br /><br />Losers are not invited. <br /><br />So. If you want to just continue on as you are? You want to play computer games and work dead end jobs and have no good prospects? Just ignore me. Do nothing different. That&#039;s fine by me. I have a great life.<br /><br />But if you want something better? If you want the chance to create a great life for yourself? If you want to create your own business, generate your own wealth and income? If you want to show the world, show your parents, you can make something of yourself, that you can do good work in this world for the benefit of many? Then consider joining up and getting to work in your local area.<br /><br />The very first area to get to work in is the area of protection of the law. I am sure that pretty much any young man can learn how to be a peace officer. After all? Just look at your police officers. Do they strike you as the sharpest knives in the drawer? How many of you think you could do a better job of being a peace officer than your local cops are doing? I would think plenty of you, right? <br /><br />The better educated and more capable men among you? You might want to volunteer to serve on Juries. And the very brightest? You might want to learn how to prepare cases for other men. As MBA Law Services grows there will be a lot of good jobs generated out of it. Those who get in first are going to have the pole position because they are the men who took the most risks. I believe in the &quot;risk reward&quot; model of business. Those who take the biggest risks of loss deserve the biggest rewards if successful.<br /><br />Look at the risks I have taken. 4,000 hours of unpaid work and USD500,000 of my own money to create cases against two national guvments over a 5 year period. Not many men are willing to take such risks. Now it is time to see if we can get these politicians, lawyers, judges, magistrates and other assorted criminals put on trial, found guilty, and take their property off them. Because if we can? There will be a very nice kick start to the cash flow for MBA Law Services that I can plough back into creating jobs for young men just like you. <br /><br />That is my call to the young men out there in the English speaking world. Your future has been sold down the toilet by your fathers and grand fathers who squandered the legacy bequeathed to them by those who fought World War II. They have squandered your future opportunities. <br /><br />You will either &quot;go with the flow&quot;, go down the path of least resistance, sleep walk into a police state. <br /><br />Or you, like me, will say: <br /><br />&quot;NO! I do not consent. I will create my own future. I will defend my own rights and the rights of my brothers in arms. I will not slink off quietly into the night like the cowards our fathers and grand fathers have shown themselves to be.&quot;<br /><br />In which case? Welcome aboard my brother. Nice to have you join us.<br /><br />In my signature below is a series of links you might like to look over so as to educate yourselves. If you have decided to join us you have quite a bit of learning to do. This is why we have created our MBA Education Channel. There is much you need to learn because you have been so comprehensively lied to.<br /><br />Please pass this notice to young men to all your mates and buddies. <br /><br />They should each have the chance to choose to join the Mens Business Association or not.<br /><br />Thanks for listening.<br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Your brother peter/joschua <br /><br />CAF Global Site http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/<br />MBA Downloads Page http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com/Downloads.aspx<br />Forum for Peters Personal Channel http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/104/scope/threads/Default.aspx<br />Forum for MBA Channel http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/452/scope/threads/Default.aspx<br />Forum for the MBA Education Channel http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/453/scope/threads/Default.aspx<br />Forum for MBA Law Services Channel http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/494/scope/threads/Default.aspx<br />Emails to Peters List http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/188/scope/threads/Default.aspx<br />The Truth Be Told Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3FPpCqDW4<br />The Truth Be Told Book http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=hNKVd0Hr7bU=&amp;tabid=753&amp;mid=1703<br />Living Free in the FemNazi World Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEq68TQWquE<br />Living Free in the Femnazi World Book http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=gjQIst2551k=&amp;tabid=753&amp;mid=1703<br />Display CAF Australia Form Posts for the last 48 hours http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/scope/threadsearch/latesthours/48/Default.aspx<br />Display CAF Australia Forum2 Posts for the last 48 hours http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums2/tabid/369/scope/threadsearch/latesthours/48/Default.aspx<br />Display CAF Australia Cases Posts for the last 48 hours http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Cases/tabid/421/scope/threadsearch/latesthours/48/Default.aspx<br />

				I know people may think this guy is a quack but let me tell you something guys, all it takes is one comment from a female to a white knight mother fucking donut eating micro-penis pig in the United States and your life is over.

The only difference being that heroin cannot force you into debtor&#039;s prison (child support) for 18 miserable years.<br /><br />Laugh at this guy all you want, give me negative karma if you will but when some of you wind up forking over a great chunk of your pay check to someone who is long gone remember that you refused sound wisdom.

				@ karensupreme:<br /><br />Hi, I am really impressed with your honesty and intelligence. It&#039;s rare to find a man who is actually smart enough to understand common sense reality.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like, please email me at John.Rambo@crimesagainstfathers.com and we can talk more. Please also go to the Mens Business Association site and register, so that we can count you as a part of us. It&#039;s taking off now, we are running a few law cases against criminals based on common law. From there, MBA will gain in popularity and will attract more attention.<br /><br />Please be part of the solution. All these guys, all they do is complain and whine. Peter is all about creating a SOLUTION to the problems of feminism and modern society.<br /><br />I can send you his two free ebooks which are only 100 pages each, it will give you a very clear idea of what the solution we are aiming for is. I can assure you, no one has created this solution before. If you want to be a part of the future, please join us.

Males and females are not the same, but they are equal in their rights to self-determination and freedom from aggression. That means that you cannot look at statistics for features of society that are gender-disparate without getting entangled in a debate of whether the feature itself is gendered. Perhaps men are more frequently incarcerated because men commit more conventional &#039;crimes&#039;- does this mean we need to change what we consider a crime so that more women go to jail too? Ridiculous. <br /><br />While you&#039;re right that men are the majority paying alimony and child support, could that not be in part due to the masculine stereotype that Dominant Man provides for Passive Woman, and that the reverse would castrate the man? In a way it&#039;s almost a selected position, and a better one to be in, given all the benefits of the dominant position. Masculinity is pretty harsh on males, and while I agree that alimony and child support decisions may be under the unjust influence of gender stereotypes, using that argument for the oppression of males is very, very close to the homophobe asking for a Straight Parade, or the white-power meat head asking for a White History Month. <br />

				All right this is going to be long. JohnRambo I&#039;ll just have you know that I&#039;m reading your responses one by one and responding to them. So you better prepare for some ass-whooping boi<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> This is a notice to all English speaking young men in the age range 18 to 30 in the “western world”. This includes places like USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia, New Zealand.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why only western world? The rest of the worlds women aren&#039;t women? Weren&#039;t we talking about equality somewhere on the thread here....hmm....anyways that&#039;s just the first line lets carry on<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I have released quite a bit of video materials to educate young men just like you. We even have our own education channel as follows:<br /><br />Forum for the MBA Education Channel (http://www.crimesagainstfathers.com/australia/Forums/tabid/82/forumid/453/scope/threads/Default.aspx)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Stupid. Blatant. Advertising. There is a (psychological) reason why that tool has given links to his propaganda WAY before he starts to even delve into that subject. I&#039;ll let you figure out why.....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> About a year ago I completed my second book. It was dedicated to young men 16 to 30. I called it &quot;The Truth Be Told&quot;. The reason I called it by that name is that young men have been lied to since the day they were born. Just like I was lied to since the day I was born. If there is one thing that has really pissed me off over the last 6 years or so it has been the realisation that almost EVERYONE lied to me since the day I was born. Many of the MEN who lied to me did so unknowingly, so they can not be too harshly blamed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lied about what? my parents told me there was a Santa when I was young and then called bullshit when I was old enough. I guess those bastards had been stabbing me in the back the whole time!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> However the VAST MAJORITY of women who lied to me did so with malice of forethought. And that includes my own grand mothers, mother and aunts. These women lied to my face. They knew they were lying when they did so. This is not excusable and I refuse to excuse them for their betrayal. These women knew the true nature of women and they lied to me about women so as to sell me a faulty bill of goods when I was too young to know what it was I was buying. I was lied to by people I loved and respected and truly believed had my best interests at heart. It is these women, the women of my extended family, that have been so instrumental in motivating me to tell you young men what women are really like.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again I ask you Sir. HOW did they lie to you. With regards to women I&#039;ll tell you how my mothers, grandmothers and aunts have lied. I remember I was about 7 once and I asked &quot;How was I born&quot;, so I was told that Garuda (an eagle, the vehicle of the god Vishnu) varied me wrapped in a blanket and dropped me in my mothers lap one fine day. Imagine my shock, horror and sense of betrayal I felt when I found out differently much later!!!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Now.

And yeah I&#039;d support that woman to betray a man in the drop of a hat if she was betrayed by him. Go talk to some men who have been divorced? How about you go talk to some WOMEN who have been divorced. There is a stigma attached to divorced women. I don&#039;t want to go into eastern culture (I&#039;m from India and that&#039;s a big no no) but even in your so called &quot;western culture&quot; I don&#039;t believe divorce is looked upon favourably by Christians, Catholics or the likes. Why don&#039;t you go ask what its like for a WOMAN who&#039;s married a powerful and well knowing MAN who calls up all the lawyers in town for no reason simply so they cant represent the wife, keeps the house, kids and everything else. You wouldn&#039;t understand the loss of something which grew inside you for 9 months and who you loved, cared and nurtured only to have it snatched away from you. A mothers bond with a child cannot be described by words. I will only say one thing. Umbilical cord. Its there for a reason<br /><br />I&#039;ll be posting more....but this, so far is just generalised BULLSHIT

Because the church, &quot;society&quot;, and the media have potrayed women in the worst light possible and its all BULLSHIT but sheep like you think its the Bible. Feminism is good. I support feminism. More power to women. Pay them MORE than men. Our society is because of women....but its always been shown as the domain of man<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Three generations ago. Men who would be in their 90s to 110 years of age were they to be alive today fought in WW II. My step grand father, Frank Trainor, was one of those men who fought and was lucky enough to survive. When I was about 14 he sat me down and he told me some stories of his mates, his fallen comrades. He did not tell me these stories as examples of &quot;glory&quot;. It was very hard for him to tell me these stories because he relived those times as he told them. <br /><br />He told me of men who died next to him while he was spared. He told me stories of men who, fatally wounded, had to be left to bleed out slowly. He told me how the small jungle animals and flies would start eating their flesh even before they were dead. How the men, too weak to even move, knew they were being eaten by rats and mice and flies, and simply accepted this was their fate. To die in some foreign land having done the best they could do to protect the people of their homelands.<br /><br />He made the point that when he and his mates were fighting in the jungles across south east asia my parents were little children. My father being born in 1937 and my mother in 1939. He made the point that should it ever be my turn to do my bit then I must not dis-honour the memory of his fallen comrades. I must, like them, fight to the death to defend my loved ones and the people of my land. This is the message he passed to me. The message from his fallen comrades. That my parents had a great life because they were willing to fight and die. That I would have a chance of a great life because his comrades were willing to fight and die.<br /><br />The men of my grand fathers generation, the men of your great grand fathers generation, fought and died in large numbers to give your grand fathers generation, my fathers generation, a better chance in life. And what did your grand fathers and fathers do? The men of my fathers generation and my generation? They took the benefits of that chance themselves and then squandered it for their own children, the men of YOUR generation.<br /><br />As you can see if you check into my background I am now 49. My father is 75 soon to be 76. My former step children are 32 and 31. My alleged children are soon to be 22 and 20. I know that of which I speak. Men of my fathers generation and my generation &quot;fell asleep at the wheel&quot;. We were told there was a &quot;cold war&quot; and an &quot;external enemy&quot; and we fell for it. All the while traitors from within slowly introduced a tyranny that was hard to distinguish. Hard to understand.<br /><br />These traitors, who so loudly proclaim how hard they are working for us and how much they care about us, have been building the preparations for a police state that will make Communist Russia and China look like picnics. These traitors are called Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.&nbsp; There are others called Doctors and Psychologists and Priests and Ministers but they are less important and are having less influence than the Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.<br /><br />I &quot;blew the whistle&quot; on these criminals in 2008. I was gathering up evidence for the criminality of these collaborators and developing a remedy so that you, the next generation, could live in freedom and peace and prosperity. When I finally delivered that remedy in November 2009 and proved it in the Australian Federal Magistrates Court I expected your fathers and your grand fathers to rally and work with me to put an end to the criminal cartel known as &quot;guvments&quot; around the world.<br /><br />But a funny thing happened. Something that shocked me at the time. Your fathers and your grand fathers refused to work with me to stop the coming tyranny. They flatly refused. And the #1 reason they refused was &quot;the guvment might hurt me&quot;. <br /><br />I would tell them: &quot;It is certainly true that the guvment might hurt you. But the only reason you have ANYTHING that can be taken from you by your own gvument is because men died for you. Your fathers and your grand fathers died in the worlds bloodiest war so that you might have the chance to live in freedom. Now? When that very freedom is under threat again you are not willing to step up to the level of your fathers and grand fathers? You are not willing to do for your sons and grand sons what your fathers and grand fathers did for you?&quot;<br /><br />The answer has proven to be a resounding &quot;Yes. We are not willing to do for others what was done for us. The next generation can sort it out for themselves.&quot;<br /><br />I recall in late 2010 I flew over to Ireland to meet with the leadership of the Irish Freeman Site. My colleague and I put it to them that if their children and grand children are to live in freedom then they must stand up to their guvment and create new courts of law. The men said no. One among them was a new grand father. His grandson was a tiny baby. Just a few weeks old I was led to believe. So I asked him. &quot;You are a grand father. What are your plans? What will you do?&quot; His answer was &quot;When they come to my door I will take a few of them with me.&quot; <br /><br />So I asked him &quot;What about your grandson who is not able to defend himself?&quot;<br /><br />And his answer was &quot;He will have to look after himself.&quot;<br /><br />I looked at the man long and hard. I really, really eyeballed him. I finally said. &quot;That is your answer? You refuse to defend your grand son with everything you have?&quot; He did not break eye contact with me and just said &quot;Yes&quot;.<br /><br />There was nothing more to say. This came from an Irish Man. This came from a man who had lived in Freedom because of the Irish Men who fought the British. And here he was, willing to go eyeball to eyeball with me and tell me he would not do the same for his grand son. <br /><br />In that moment I saw that betrayal of the grand children is now acceptable for grand fathers and fathers alike.<br /><br />I can tell you. I was not very happy with that man. But he must make his own choices. <br /><br />I have talked to 10,000 such men, if not 100,000 such men. I do not know how many men of my generation, 49, and my fathers generation, 74, I have talked to because I have put posts into public spaces that could be read by any number of people.<br /><br />The message I can give to you young men of 18 to 30 is this. Your grand fathers and fathers are not going to help you. They are not going to work against the introduction of the tyranny that is coming for your benefit. They are openly condoning and supporting the introduction of the New World Order. They want you enslaved. They want you to be paying taxes in the future to pay for their &quot;welfare benefits&quot;. The vast majority of them are fully aware that there is a tyranny being introduced. The thousands that I talk to refuse to pass along the word of the coming tyranny pretending &quot;I don&#039;t believe you so I will not pass the word along&quot; when they know full well what is going on. They say they don&#039;t. But they absolutely know.<br /><br />They are betraying you because they know what is coming and they are doing nothing to stop it.<br /><br />Now. Just before I go into the next section I want to share with you something of my life because you might not read it in my books and it is important to this presentation. <br /><br />I have had a charmed life. Many people tell lies about me and say I am &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;bitter&quot; or any of a whole bunch of other lies. I was telling one of the boys I grew up next door to the other day that &quot;if I ever complained about my life you should just slap me one because I have had a better life than just about anyone else I know. Very few men get to live a life like me.&quot;<br /><br />I won the DNA lottery when it came to God handing out brains. Such is life. I got lucky. I was dux of my high school and I was awarded a scholarship for physics at the Australian National University. I turned it down because I had started my first job as a trainee programmer for a large company in Australia called Australian Iron and Steel. I was assigned to the programming team for the Plate Mill. This was the mill that made flat steel plate for things like ships, oil rigs, flooring in buildings, pipelines and the like. <br /><br />Of course, in 1982, deciding to be a software developer was a very risky decision. No one had any idea that software development was going to become the industry it became. We were paid pittances in those days and seen as &quot;propeller heads&quot;. We were much hated by the men on the factory floor as they saw us as taking their jobs off them with automation. A view they had much justification in having by the way.<br /><br />In 1985 IBM came to our university campus. I decided to go for a campus interview. I was dressed in my usual leathers for riding my motorbike which took the interviewer aback. I also had the requisite long hair and beard that university students have. He said that &quot;We at IBM are looking for the best of the best. We are looking for people who are great at what they do and know they are great at what they do.&quot; I told him that he was looking for me then. I told him I was the top programmer in my year at the university and the top programmer in my intake year for Australian Iron and Steel. I was very self confident. Something that less capable people like to call arrogant. People of lesser capability like to try and slur people of greater capability with the term &quot;arrogant&quot;. People of great capability almost NEVER use the word &quot;arrogant&quot; of anyone. If the person has the goods we admire them. If they do not have the goods but pretend they do we pity them because that is a terrible way to live.<br /><br />I got the job at IBM and I went into the International Software Development Centre in Sydney in 1986. I did my first overseas trip in November 1986. It was only to New Zealand but it was a start. Next year, in 1987, I went to Hong Kong for three months for IBM. I was asked to go straight on to Thailand for another two months but I was sick and I was burned out. In 88 I went to Malaysia for 8 weeks. My then fiancée finally put her foot down and demanded I quit the long trips. I did a few weeks in Taiwan to hand over my job and took a new job that did not require so much travel to placate my then fiancée. Big mistake by the way lads. If a woman EVER gives you an ultimatum like &quot;stop travelling or I will leave you&quot; then you MUST say &quot;Then go now, get out.&quot;&nbsp; Never, EVER give in to a woman&#039;s &quot;ultimatum&quot;. EVER. She will hate you for your weakness.<br /><br />I spent many years not travelling. But Jennifer was wasteful of money. She also quit work. So in 1996 I took a job at Hitachi Data Systems. One of the reasons they could not fill the position was the level of travel that would be required. The role was for the Business Development Manager for Asia Pacific for Business Intelligence. This would require massive amounts of travel going around Asia Pacific giving presentations to HDS customers so as to launch the Business Intelligence Practice. It was also a well paid position and I had four children and a wife to feed. So I took the job and told Jennifer she had no choice about the travel as she was refusing to work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />4 pages, 2075 words of horseshit propaganda having NOTHING to do with the topic.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From then on, 1996, I have travelled extensively for my work. I would have to sit down and try and recall all the countries I have worked in. But it is likely to be well more than 20 by now. I have worked on all continents except South America. I have worked in at least 200 companies across those 20 countries. I have had dream contracts and I have had some pretty bad contracts. But more than anything else I have had a life experience that few get to enjoy. Many people outright disbelieve me when I talk about my life. They just say &quot;No one ever got to live a life like that, not even presidents and kings!&quot;<br /><br />Well? I did get to live a life like that. I am not a president and not a king. I have lived a life blessed in so many ways that I can only think of one lad I grew up with who could realistically say he did better than me. And that would be Mark Taylor,&nbsp; the former Australian cricket captain. Mark and I played cricket together and against each other in school. His sister was in my class so we knew each other pretty well at school. He was good at cricket at school but no one would have picked him as ever making it to being an opening batsman for Australia.<br /><br />One of the incidents that marked Mark for greatness was this. One day we were playing on opposing teams. I was captain of my&nbsp; team but I was ill and unable to take the field. Mark was on 98 and going for his hundred. Our bowler managed to get one to cut back a little bit and beat the edge of the bat and rapped him on the pads. My dad was umpiring and gave him out leg before wicket. <br /><br />Mark came over to me and said &quot;You can tell your father later that he didn&#039;t have to give me out, he could have let me get my hundred.&quot;<br /><br />So I asked him. &quot;Well, were you out?&quot;<br /><br />And he said &quot;Sure, I was out, and I deserved to go, but I really would have liked to have gotten my hundred.&quot;<br /><br />The VAST MAJORITY of other lads would have denied being out and been a bit angry about the situation. But young Mark was quite willing to admit the ball beat him. He was going for one of his standard off drives, a shot he had even at that time, and the ball was a little close to the body to be doing that and got a bit of movement back and so there was no question in Marks mind that the ball was going to hit the stumps and he was &quot;man enough&quot; at 14 to admit that.<br /><br />It marked him as an honest lad. <br /><br />So many years later when Mark was on 334 overnight against India, the equal highest score by an Australian next to the greatest ever Donald Bradman and Sid Barnes, and there was much speculation in the media about whether, as captain, he would decide to bat for 10 minutes to break the record or whether he would declare overnight. Knowing Mark there was never a question in my mind. He would declare overnight so as to give his team the best chance of bowling out the Indians. <br /><br />So I am more than willing to concede that Mark Taylor, former Australian Cricket Captain, opening batsman and cricketing great had a better life than I did.&nbsp; His headline statistics are as follows: &quot;In 104 Test matches, he scored 7,525 runs with a batting average of 43.49, including 19 centuries and 40 fifties.&quot;<br /><br />But after Mark? Of the lads who were in my peer group in the schools around my area? Some made more money than me, sure. Some have in tact families, sure. But I don&#039;t know anyone else who raised four children, travelled the world, and made it to the top of his profession in something so mundane as Information Technology. <br /><br />The point I want to emphasis to you young men is this. Those men who died next to my step grand father? Those men who bled out in the jungles across south east asia? Those men who never saw their 21st birthday in many cases and were rarely older than 25? Those young men died fighting for what they believed in. As a result I got to live a great life. A life almost unequalled even in my own time. Only the very luckiest or most talented get to live a life like I have lived. <br /><br />I owe those men a debt of honour. I owe them a debt that I can never repay. There is only one way to repay the debt of men who fought and died for you. That is to be the guardian of what they fought and died for. Liberty. Freedom. The chance of a better life for those left behind. I got that chance that was paid for with their lives. It is my obligation to my step grand fathers fallen comrades to be the guardian of the liberty and opportunity they died for.<br /><br />This is why, as soon as I realised that the judge dealing with my family law case in Ireland was a criminal that I realised that there was something very, very wrong in the whole system of guvment. I had to deal with first things first and disown my former children, go through my suicidal period and come out the other side. But once I had made it through being suicidal and had come out the other side in May 2008 I made a very conscious choice to go into battle with these criminals for the benefit of others, particularly young men just like you. To defend those who were too young or not well informed enough to defend themselves.<br /><br />There is a saying on 4CHAN. It is &quot;we are not your private army&quot;. I was asking my friend John Rambo what that means because, being 49, I believed it likely had meaning I did not understand. John explained to me that it means that though there might be a lot of young men on 4chan they see themselves as not being obliged in any way to help out anyone else. They are &quot;no mans private army&quot; to be doing things for other men. That is what he told me, be it true or false.<br /><br />My question to that is this. &quot;Why not?&quot; <br /><br />I have been, for five years, a one man &quot;private army&quot; doing battle with the powers that be, the Illuminati, for the benefit of others. I most certainly did not do it for myself. It would have been much safer and much easier to just have my ex, Jennifer, killed and to move on with my life. But that would only have served me. It would not have served all the other fathers and it would not have served the millions of young men around the word whose futures have been sold down the toilet by their fathers and grand fathers.<br /><br />If you, as a young man, take the position, &quot;I am no mans private army&quot; meaning that you will never stand up for your brother when he has been criminally victimised or is in need of help then under the law &quot;do unto others&quot; you can&#039;t expect your brother to stand up for you. That is how life is. If you want someone to do something for you then you either pay them or you do for others what you expect back from them. It is quite simple.<br /><br />Now. I have spent 5 years working through this process. In 2009 I started the call to your fathers and grand fathers for the creation of common law courts. In Australia we proclaimed new common law courts into existence on April 15th 2011. And yet? Your fathers and your grand fathers are so cowardly they are not willing to sit on the juries of these courts and run these courts as open and transparent courts citing &quot;fear of the guvment&quot; if they do. <br /><br />And those lads who bled out in the jungle in WW II? What would be happing in your land now if those men who died in WW II refused to fight because they were &quot;fearful of getting hurt&quot;? Australians would be speaking Japanese. British would be speaking German. Right? You get my meaning. That men were willing to fight and die to defend liberty and freedom, as they believed they were doing, places a burden of responsibility on those who follow to guard those freedoms so hard won.<br /><br />Your fathers and your grand fathers will not do this in any number. You can go and ask them yourselves to join us on CAF and MBA if you want. Please. Go ask them. Get their &quot;no&quot; to your face. Have them betray you right to your face like my father betrayed me right to my face. I would encourage you to do that so that you can look your father and/or grand father in the eye as he lies to you and betrays you. It will hurt more but it will be clearer for you what you might do next.<br /><br />And what MIGHT you do next?<br /><br />Well? I would ask. Why are you NOT your brothers personal army when he has been criminally victimised or is in need of your help? Why would you leave your brother to fend for himself when he is out of his depth?<br /><br />When I was young there was a very popular song in Australia by a man named Rolf Harris. It was called &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;. You can listen to it and read the lyrics here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QscvXkYQAek<br /><br />The story is basically two little boys are playing with their toy horses. One lad has an accident and his horses head falls off. As he is crying for his broken toy his friend says that he can share his horse and he can go just as fast with two. So the lad is happy again. Long years pass and they are both on the battlefield. The little boy who was the one who helped gets wounded and is dying on the battlefield and needs to be rescued. Of course, who comes to his rescue is the lad who he had helped out and shown kindness to all those years before.<br /><br />For us Australian lads this song epitomised our Australian ideal of &quot;mateship&quot; that we had in the 60s, 70s and 80s. You never let your mates down. If your mate needs help you help. He should not even have to ask if you are a &quot;good mate&quot;. I was raised to always keep my eye out on those around me and notice if anyone was in distress or trouble where they needed some help. I was raised to go and offer that help unasked. If I was turned down that would be fine. 99% of the time I have offered my help to someone across the years it has been accepted as the offer of kindness and concern that it was.<br /><br />Somewhere in the 90s and 00s this ideal of &quot;mateship&quot; disappeared from the Australian way of life. We, Australians, for whatever reason, no longer come to the aid of a man in need. We leave him to his fate. We will still help &quot;women and children&quot;, but the vast majority of people in Australia and Ireland will not help men. Men have been relegated to 4th class citizens behind women, children and DOGS. You lads would do well to know this. <br /><br />Australian men, for their own part, became quite impossible to actually help. The very need for help seems to be &quot;offensive&quot; to them. They have had this idea that &quot;macho&quot; or &quot;manly&quot; means to &quot;never be in need of help&quot;. This, of course, is ludicrous. We all need a hand every now and then no matter who we are. The old beatles song of &quot;I Get By With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; comes to mind. <br /><br />When you do offer help to Australian men now they do not accept the help offered which is generally the help needed. They prefer instead to demand support that is not of any earthly use to them and seem determined to refuse to understand the position in which they are in. It beggars belief but that is 99% of the men I have tried to assist over the last few years in the area of family law. <br /><br />It has actually been so impossible to help Australian fathers that I have had to refuse to help them any more out of my own time and out of my own pocket. They simply parasite off any man who is willing to do such and then do not join in the fight once they are back on their feet in the vast majority. Of course, there are exceptions but they are actually quite rare. The very fact that it has taken more than THREE YEARS to assemble 180 or so men willing to sit on new juries in new courts in Australia you can see the issue at hand.<br /><br />The next step, of running a court and getting a guilty verdict, is going to lead to the position where there is a need to seize the property of a guilty party and hand it to the victim of their crime(s) so as to remedy the crimes. If your fathers and grand fathers have been too cowardly in the main to create new courts how do you think they will go seizing property?<br /><br />This leaves you young men with a decision to make about your futures. Will you return to the values of &quot;mateship&quot; and &quot;brotherhood&quot;? Will you help your brother in need? Or will you, like your fathers and grand fathers, leap tall buildings in a single bound to help a woman with a broken fingernail while leaving your brother to lay bleeding to death on the battlefield?<br /><br />What is at stake is no less than your future. As I said. I am 49. I have had a great life already. I will never have grand children now. There is not that much to look forward to other than more of the same great lifestyle I have had over the last 25 years. Only now I am free to date much younger and much more attractive women than be with my overweight and over 50 ex wife. My life is great. I am going to keep doing it until my maker calls me. Having been suicidal I see every day above ground as a great bonus. I am going to enjoy every minute of it. <br /><br />But you, young man? How is your life? What are your prospects? If you live in the western English speaking world? You are far more likely to have poor prospects for your life. You will likely have been betrayed in school by your female teachers. You are likely to have been deprived of the education that your fathers paid taxes for as the &quot;needs of the girls&quot; were put in front of your needs. <br /><br />With blatant discrimination against men in universities very few of you would have gotten a degree. Very few of you would have been able to secure a job at a large firm like I did at IBM. The vast majority of you will not have a prayer of living a life like I have lived these last 25 years. John Rambo has described to me in great detail what the world looks like for a &quot;twenty something man&quot; in the western English speaking world. And it is not good. If you add to that the efforts of your guvments to get World War 3 started? Who do you young men think are going to be the primary victims of World War 3 if they get it started? Who do you think is going to be the primary victims of the civil wars they are trying to start?<br /><br />Here is a hint. NOT your fathers and grandfathers. Those traitors are going to try and sell YOU on going to war to DEFEND THEM. The very men who are too gutless to sit on a jury to secure your rights will demand YOU DIE to secure their safety. <br /><br />You might want to think about that.<br /><br />So. Let&#039;s say you now understand that you have pretty poor prospects. What can YOU do about it? <br /><br />Well? I have been YOUR PERSONAL ARMY for five years now. I have worked my butt off to try and re-introduce the rule of law into Ireland and Australia and then help other men from there on as and when possible. I risked my life to do so. I spent 4,000+ hours and USD500,000 of my own money. I asked your fathers and your grand fathers to stand up to criminal women and criminal guvments and re-introduce the rule of law. We have some small number of such men. But we are going to need more men who are willing to act in roles like Peace Officers, Private Investigators and Jury Members. <br /><br />So the invitation I am extending to young men is to join the Mens Business Association and volunteer for those roles. These are the links you can use.<br />http://www.mensbusinessassociation.com<br />http://www.mbaposervices.com<br />http://www.mbapiservices.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />LAST PART<br /><br />As you can see. Your fathers and grand fathers are not signing up to be Peace Officers or Private Investigators in the new economy we are building. They are too gutless and cowardly to do so. They falsely believe &quot;the police&quot; are there to help them. I find such wilful delusion to be quite ludicrous. <br /><br />You can see from the links below and the lack of response by Police Officers.&nbsp; Police Officers are NOT willing to be Peace Officers at least in Australia and Ireland. And the same is likely true for other countries. Feel free to taker a look at these two videos that have been passed to Police Officers in Ireland and Australia. I have noticed the Police in Ireland and Australia in 2011. Both lots of Police have made their intentions clear. They are siding with the guvment. They intend that you men live in a police state where they get to be your slave masters. You might want to object to that.<br />D78 - Statement to Australian Police Officers (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsnS1oyuuHE)<br />D80 - Statement to Irish Garda (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq87WojzBRs)<br /><br /><br />At the end of the day there is only one way for you young men to improve your prospects. That is to improve your prospects yourselves. For you to become the &quot;personal army&quot; of your brother. To come to your brothers aid when he is in need. To be willing to labour WITH your brother in co-operation and collaboration to create a future that is worth living in. Because I can tell you for sure and for certain, the future that your guvments have lined up for you is going to make it very questionable as to whether it is going to be one you want to live in.<br /><br />How do you improve your prospects? A lot of young men are expressing the desire to &quot;see the world burn&quot;. There is a nihilistic attitude expressed by many young men. It is very much along the lines of &quot;I was screwed over so I don&#039;t care if the world burns, I have my popcorn and a beer, I am going to watch it go up in flames.&quot; There is a certain level of justification in doing so. I can see why many young men would see it like that. You would see the obstacles as insurmountable. You see you have no leadership to show you how to improve your prospects. You see there are few men of my age and ability showing any real care or concern for you.<br /><br />But here is the thing. There are a few men like Bill Greathouse and I who would really like to see you men have better prospects in life. And not by being some wage slave for some greedy man who would kick you to the gutter as soon as he could. There is a future you can live into and create that will improve your prospects so that you can live a great life. That future is what we are building at the Mens Business Association. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />4 more pages, 3k+ more words of bullshit

No more divorces, and no more men getting ass raped in divorce. It&#039;s that simple.

				It&#039;s pretty common for women to get the possessions and alimony in divorce due to most families having either a sole breadwinner (usually the man) or the man making more money.&nbsp; The immediate solution is, I agree, to not get married, and you won&#039;t have to part with your property or pay alimony (you would still have to pay child support if there were children if you didn&#039;t get sole custody, but really child support is for the child so it shouldn&#039;t be looked on negatively as long as the recipient doesn&#039;t use it for anything besides the child)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been divorced, and had to pay a lot of (well, a lot for me at the time, left me with no money after paying bills) money in spousal support/alimony along with losing every item of value in my apartment and it sucks.&nbsp; moral of the story, when you get married to someone, you are already giving everything to that other person, and if you get divorced, half of it goes away.<br /><br />Chivalry wasn&#039;t the answer either and feminism (in its current state) is pretty much just the polar opposite, and doesn&#039;t work either.&nbsp; We need REAL equality.&nbsp; Judge a woman totally by her abilities, compensate her accordingly, hold her to the same standards as men, but reward her for performance equally to men.&nbsp; On the flip side, don&#039;t automatically grant sole custody to the woman unless she&#039;s disqualified (some states are getting better about this) and hold them jsut as responsible.&nbsp; Equal.

Feminism was never about equality. It is a hate movement against men. It was all about giving women advantages and privileges over men. Feminism is the same thing as misandry. Misandry= the hatred of men and boys.

				Shit, how could I forget?<br /><br />ANOTHER solution to feminism is for us western men to simply basically BOYCOTT American/western women and just refuse to date or marry them, and instead date or marry non-western women, like Asian women, Indian women, South American women, or African women.<br /><br />That&#039;s the positive solution in all of this. Asian/Indian women are not brainwashed by all of that feminism crap like western women are. Asian/Indian women are actually a PLEASURE to be around. They are not a pain in the ass to be around like so many western women are.<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s one GOOD thing about open immigration. Plenty of beautiful young Asian, Indian, Spanish women. God bless America and bless Obama too, for his open immigration policies.

				I admit my sample size is small, but I haven&#039;t seen a woman get paid as much as me doing the same work as me since I was in the military where they have very structured pay raises that apply to all members of a given pay grate at a given number of years of service.&nbsp; Now that i work in the private sector, I see a lot of women in positions that pay less, and I don&#039;t work with many women at all.&nbsp; Then again, I don&#039;t know of many women that can perform the physical labor that I am required to do either, but I have met some that could, and if they had my position, it&#039;d be only right for them to get paid the same.&nbsp; Alas, that inequality I was talking about earlier works both ways, so most of the women I work with have jobs that are more clerical or analytical in nature and don&#039;t get paid as much as my position (which requires analytical skills, specific knowledge, knowledge of theoretical principles, and raw strength)<br /><br />I do agree that a majority of &quot;feminists&quot; aren&#039;t really feminists so much as misandrists. That shit needs to stop just as much as all of the other problems.&nbsp; As for your proposed solutions, we would just be resetting the clock back. A lot of women from those cultures are the same as 19th to early 20th century women in terms of what they expect in the differences between men and women.&nbsp; My mother was born and raised in a rural town in Korea.&nbsp; She is great with finances and schedules, but any time there is something to be done that is masculine, she won&#039;t go near it, and if there is something that needs done that is &quot;expected of a woman&quot;, my dad, her husband of nearly 40 years, can&#039;t touch it.<br /><br />My ideology of the &quot;star trek solution&quot; is (to me) the best solution, but would require so much of a cultural change, that I don&#039;t see it being real within my life span<br /><br />And now, I&#039;m off to bed for a while, the alcohol has taken hold and I can barely focus

I mean, the guy was kind of over the top about it, but there is an interesting phenomenon where women want all of the rights men have, but also want to be treated as the &#039;weaker gender&#039; when it suits their needs. So they want the right to harass and assault men, but want there to be a severe social stigma against a man hitting a woman. They want all of the rights men are allowed economically and socially, but they enjoy getting what tend to be safer/easier jobs because they&#039;re not burly enough to lift heavy shit or chip rocks in a mine or hike through a jungle with a fifty pound pack, but they want all of those things that have been earned by people who were willing to get dirty or risk their lives. <br /><br />As far as alimony and child support, you can&#039;t honestly believe that&#039;s a fair game. A demonstrably shitty mother can often win custody over a loving father, because there is an ingrained sympathy towards women in society. I&#039;ve seen it happen, and it is hideously disgusting. Not to mention that there is no governmental oversight on the funds the mother receives, or even for the most part on how closely she follows the court&#039;s ruling. Mothers waste the money for their children on stupid shit for themselves, and few people care. Mothers deny fathers their legal right to see their kids, and few people care. Fathers with no money who haven&#039;t seen their kids in years go to jail if they stop paying up. It disgusts me.<br /><br />But your homelessness rationalization takes the cake. Only men are addicts? Only men have mental illnesses? Shit, women make less on the dollar than men, but somehow &#039;the economy&#039; causes men to be so much more likely to be cripplingly poor?<br /><br />I read an amusing anecdote once: A secretary at a mining company found out that women were making less money than male counterparts of similar lengths of employment. They began decrying this as gender discrimination. So the boss said, OK, you can have your equal share. All secretarial positions are being outsourced to india. But there is a standing job offer for all of you in the mines, if you want it. Amazingly enough, when faced with this degree of equality, none of the secretaries showed up for work the next day.<br /><br />The current fight for equality with women is pretty much the same as the fight for equality with minorities. At first, it was about having exactly the same rights as white men. Then, it was about having the rights of being white, but also the bonuses of being not white. If that&#039;s the definition of equality, its a really shitty definition

				http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2316545/Simon-Pritchard-hanged-days-birth-twin-daughters.html#<br /><br />A 35 year old guy in the UK just committed suicide because his girlfriend was putting pressure on him for huge child support payments, and probably threatened to have him thrown in jail if he didn&#039;t pay.<br /><br />We all know how unfair the child support system is towards men. In most cases, it can be 50 percent or even more of a man&#039;s salary. So tell me, if a man makes 2000 dollars a month, and has to give a thousand of it to some cheating bitch who divorced him and kidnapped his children from him, how the fuck is that guy supposed to live on just a thousand bucks a month?<br /><br />The divorce system is extremely unfair towards men, and so is the child support system. If we made these systems MORE FAIR towards men, it could reduce the number of male suicides by perhaps HALF.<br /><br />But no, you women could care fucking less about trying to reduce male suicide. You women only think of men as walking wallets and as disposable, this is your misandry, your hatred of men. And then you stupid bitches complain when men are no longer buying into the SCAM known as marriage?<br /><br />Reducing male suicide = hatred of women, according to the sick and twisted &quot;logic&quot; in most women&#039;s heads.<br /><br />Your misandry, your hatred of men, is on open display for all to see. So by all means, ladies, keep on spewing your man-hatred, I&#039;m sure that it will encourage more men to marry you (LOL, sarcasm).

				If what I have claimed above is NOT true? That &quot;American and western women could care less about men committing suicide&quot;, that is, if American and western women DO care about men killing themselves?<br /><br />Then why don&#039;t American women and western women start DEMANDING an end to the anti-male divorce system, the anti-male legal system, and the anti-male child support system?<br /><br />It is the above 3 anti-male systems which contribute to the majority of male suicide.<br /><br />So, if American and western women DO CARE about male suicide, why aren&#039;t they trying to STOP the above 3 anti-male systems?<br /><br />How many American/western women do you know that are speaking out against the above 3 anti-male systems? I do not know even a single one.<br /><br />Therefore, 99.9 percent of American and western women literally DO NOT CARE about male suicide.<br /><br />Now equality is equality. There was a recent article about some girl who had gotten &quot;raped&quot; (i.e. she got drunk and allowed herself to get gangraped and she loved every minute of it) and ended up committing suicide.<br /><br />WHY SHOULD I GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THAT BITCH?<br /><br />How many hundreds of millions of western men have been RAPED in divorce court? How many millions of men have COMMITTED SUICIDE as a result of that? And yet women could care fucking less about all of those dead men.<br /><br />Thus, in true equality, why should I give a shit about some dead bitch?<br /><br />Do unto others as they do unto you.

				How do you know we haven&#039;t stopped many male suicides already? Peter is one of the few people speaking the ACTUAL TRUTH and young men readily accept his message because he is speaking the TRUTH.<br /><br />Then again people like you could care fucking less about male suicide, which is why you want me and Peter to just shut up. What a heartless son of a bitch you are.

Maybe you shouldn&#039;t make your husband angry and he won&#039;t beat you&quot;.<br /><br />Feminism will always destroy itself, so the best thing you can do right now is to avoid women unless you know the woman is cool and can actually trust her. Don&#039;t even date or have sex with women that you do not know or can not trust, because it&#039;s very possible that they will hit you with a false rape accusation.<br /><br />Simply boycott women and let the bitches support themselves. American women are always talking about how &quot;independent&quot; they are. Fine. Pay your own bills, bitch, and stop freeloading off of men like a fucking parasite.

I mean, if you like a girl, then just co-habit with her, as a common law wife.<br /><br />Why in the hell would any man sign a legal contract, a marriage contract, when the legal system is so biased against men? If you get divorced, and there&#039;s a 60 percent chance that you will (with 85 percent of divorces INITIATED by women), you are almost certainly going to be forced by the courts to pay alimony, child support, and will probably lose your house to your ex wife (if you owned a house to begin with).<br /><br />As for having children, well in America, men have almost no custody rights over their own children. Your ex-wife can literally just take the kids and move across the country and there is pretty much nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />So, I don&#039;t see why any man is stupid enough to still get married or have children in America. I guess the men who are dumb enough to do that are either manginas, or are completely ignorant as to how biased and anti-male the divorce system is for men.<br /><br />Funny how feminists aren&#039;t DEMANDING that 50 percent of alimony/child support payers should be WOMEN? Hypocrites.

				I am not a man-hater or an anything hater. There are some things I don&#039;t love and that&#039;s beside the point. The point is that social constructs have endangered the worth of women and denied them agency over their own choices. I&#039;m not sorry about your suicide count or your divorce system. There is no evidence to support that the courts actually and in technical terms &quot;favour&quot; women. I think you&#039;re afraid of women having their own choice in the ways they dress, solutions they find, and money they make because it is threatening to your masculinity, which seems to be the basis of your own self worth, a sad and unstable foundation for self esteem when one is absent critical thinking and a base of rational knowledge. <br /><br />Long LIVE THE DPR!!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE PROSPERITY!!!

You can fight the anti-male feminist laws not by trying to repeal them, but by TRANSCENDING them.<br /><br />If you never get married in America, then obviously you can never be screwed in divorce.<br />If you never have children with a woman in America, then obviously she can never screw you over by kidnapping your kids and demanding huge child support payments.<br /><br />The solution is not to fight the system, but to BOYCOTT it. So instead of fighting feminists and fighting American women, simply BOYCOTT THEM. Don&#039;t waste your money on American women, taking them out on dates or buying drinks for them. Save up your money, and take a trip to Thailand or Asia or the Ukraine and experience REAL WOMEN.<br /><br />Once you experience real women, you will never be able to go back to the mutant women of the West.

				I&#039;m confused.<br /><br />Does this mean I should change to Asian hookers?<br /><br />On a more serious note, if not for the bomb girls, WWII (and the great depression) would have gone a hell of a different direction. I don&#039;t think you have actually read a history book, much less researched any of the very statistics you copy and paste in each post you make. Women did this to us men? I think you might want to figure a few things out for yourself. It wasn&#039;t the women that were flooding demands to go to war any of those times.<br /><br />As for the average female salary versus male, I would like to see sample sizes and data for that. Taking a broad spectrum analysis of majority fields is hardly a true demographic. Industry counts.<br /><br />There is some validity to the idea that, in the fight for equality in the past two centuries here in America, women have in some ways been given either a head start, or been handicapped in value as to equal the playing field so to speak. Some of these policies are founded in principals that were appropriate 100 years ago, and may not be so today. However, in no way do I feel I am at a disadvantage, because a woman gets a free second look and I don&#039;t. Personally I enjoy the challenge. I also enjoy the challenge of getting a stripper to go on a date. But, that just the kind of man I am. <br /><br />More often than not I&#039;ve lost to men, not women, when attempting something like a job interview. In all the time I have been working as an adult, and accounting all of my job interviews failed and succeeded, statistically 100% of them had at least one female going out for it, and there is no statistical evidence of an advantage that I can see. They picked the right person for the job - it had nothing to do with gender. This would also go for people that I personally have hired too - when selecting resumes I request that an HR person intentionally remove any gender specific identification specifically so that I am not jaded in the first phase, and this very practice was one that was taught to me and standard at more than one workplace I was at. I will say though, that in all those times that I was performing the selection process, Women tended to have the better experience profile. They worked harder to do what they wanted to do, and generally speaking their resumes showed it. And, when two great resumes came forward, where they were separate genders, I will be honest: Women tend to lie less on their resume. Men would bullshit, and then when I would test them on it, they failed. That&#039;s not an equality thing, trust me - being a systems engineer in any degree of IT requires you know something to have gotten to the interview. If you say something on your resume that made me look, and you come back as a liar on that point, you aren&#039;t getting the job. I tested both for similar concepts, and the ones that got it right more than the other were women - and that includes situations where both got it right.<br /><br />As for &quot;Peter Andrew Nolan&quot; I would like to see some info related to the supposed accomplishments this man has made in his life. Personally, I can find no mention on him in any association to NASA, or any related industry, for the past 30 years. Given his exploits, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the information has been redacted. What I can find, is mostly of a sociopath and troubled behavior. I mostly come to that conclusion from reading his own written information.<br /><br />Now, back to your statistics that you seem to be vested in. I can honestly say that I have done research into the subject. From the get go, the reality is that while you may be right to certain extents (ie, up to around WW2/Korean War/~1970), that women did not serve in combat (other than the Women Air Service Pilots (famously referred to as wasps) which actually did serve in combat) for the most part. This artificially limits the very scope of the potential for statistically significant death, given that the wasps were only around 1100 actively certified pilots that flew missions. The real work that women provided in WWII was in the overall driving of the manufacturing done in the US, which is one of the primary turnarounds for the depression thanks to the militarization and use of materials exceeding supply and driving money back into the homeland. To that end, Women very well supplied the entire allied war effort after Pearl Harbor when the rest of the Allied nations were running out of their own materials. Following that, women started getting a role in the military, but it didn&#039;t fully take off until after Vietnam. Now, as for the reality today: Women who join the military almost definitely face some form of sexual abuse at some point in their career within the military. Men are pigs, and while the military has cut back and is no longer allowing the real bad seed to get out of criminal charges by enlisting, the overall truth is that the average grunt is not joining because he&#039;s a nuclear scientist. This is not a debate, this is an absolute fact: if the military arrests related to abuse were counted with the standard civilian arrests, the number would probably increase a few fold. So, before you go jumping at the idea that women are intentionally not put in harms way, its our own fault: we harm them before they can.<br /><br />The advantage to what I am stating here, is that its verifiable. The abuse has had a very big impact on the country lately, as even the officers charged with protecting the women have been arrested for the very thing they are supposed to be charging and bringing to rest.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m going to choose to stop there, as I think I&#039;ve gotten my own point across. If you are going to spit out details, and idolize a sociopath, I would prefer to see informative debate and appropriate fact vetting than the repetitive usage of unfounded and unproven statistics. I&#039;ve intentionally left statistics, which are publicly available if you just look for them, off. If you refuse to actually look at all of the facts about what you are saying, then you are not objectively looking at a situation.<br /><br />If you are not willing to accept that you are wrong on something, then your bias automatically generates apathy towards acceptance of your message from those reading. If you can substantiate your claims, and affirm your belief, with appropriate facts after being corrected, then you have a much better chance of a conversation from all of us.

They are false because they conflate an undefined &#039;feminism&#039; with the enormous and diverse category of &#039;western women&#039;. This is a gross oversimplification and can as such be dismissed as specious reasoning.<br /><br />Secondly the argument relies on the acceptance of the near universal adoption of a conspiratorial programme of values by &#039;western women&#039; to deliberately harm and emasculate men. This is also unevidenced and is shrill and paranoid in tone.<br /><br />Thirdly the remedy is, according to you, to become a sex tourist. Whilst I do not agree with the prohibition of personal proclivities, I do consider the buying of economically disadvantaged persons for sex to be somewhat sordid, and the last resort of the desperate. I have had sex with whores myself (in the Netherlands) and whilst they are skilled there is undeniably something about the transaction that renders the experience far inferior to an encounter arising from chance or affection: that it is a transaction, perhaps.<br /><br />In addition it seems that men most fond of sex tourism are not very good at relating to women. It appears that if you cannot accept women on their own terms, as an equal if you like, then you must engineer an advantage by only approaching women whose economic livelihood relies on their ability to obey and satisfy you. You are buying their submission.<br /><br />I am aware that this last will upset you, but the conclusion is unavoidable. It seems you are incapable of relating to women on a level playing field. That does not sound very masculine to me. It sounds weak and pathetic.<br /><br />I have never had difficulty in talking to women, developing relationships with them or working with them any more than I have (where appropriate) with men. Some are idiots, some not. I find that people like you, who see &#039;feminism&#039; as some threatening, monolithic project contrived to neuter men are insecure, prone to generalisation, and consider the strength of their feelings to be the justice of their argument.<br /><br />To take another approach, feminism is a far more complicated issue than is rendered by your reference to it. To offer a brief &#039;for instance&#039; on the matter I find it indefensible that, spite or personal animus excepted, any sane man would support&nbsp; the idea that an equally capable woman should be paid less for doing the same job as a man. <br /><br />Another matter is that of sexual assault and rape. It is routinely reported in the UK that as few as one in thirty cases of rape are prosecuted. Does this indicate an institutional bias in favour of women? The idea that a woman who dresses in a certain manner is &#039;asking for it&#039; is also widespread and the survival of ideas such as this indicates that the culture is far from the feminised, misandrist dystopia you advance.<br /><br />It is rather droll that you actually come across as more than a little hysterical yourself. I do hope you meet a nice woman one day and put this objectionable bile behind you.

I guess you losers must subscribe to the notion &quot;Women are innocent little angels and can do no harm, and if a problem happens, it is ALWAYS the man&#039;s fault&quot;.<br /><br />The kicker is, women HATE beta-males. Women will marry them and use them for their money, but women are NOT sexually attracted to beta males.

				A question I would like to ask now:<br /><br />Why are the majority of western men, especially white men, such pathetic, weak little bitches?<br /><br />Look at men from the non-western world, like South American men, Russian men, or Arab men.<br /><br />They still act like a man, and are tough, strong, independent, and not weak-willed.<br /><br />And, THIS is why so many western women are attracted to such men. BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL MEN.<br /><br />All of you beta-male mangina western men reading this? You need to STOP being such pussies. Learn how to be an alpha. Stop being such a wimpy little doormat that women feel they can wipe their feet on. Because the fact is, if you guys continue being beta-males, you are never going to attract women that way. The only kind of woman you will attract is the gold-digging type who will marry you simply for your money.<br /><br />In short, I am asking the western men reading this to STOP being such a bunch of damn pussies and wimps. Realize that you have been brainwashed by liberalism and feminism and that this has stolen your masculinity from you, and GIVE UP SUCH BRAINWASHING and become a REAL MAN again.

				Now some of you may be asking &quot;What is a beta male?&quot; or how do I know if I&#039;m a beta male or not.<br /><br />If you support feminism, you are a beta male.<br />If you are a liberal, you are a beta male.<br />If you put women on a pedestal, you are a beta male.<br />If you refuse to ever assert yourself or discipline your woman, you are a beta male.<br />If you&#039;re a &quot;nice guy&quot;, a &quot;sensitive guy&quot;, you are a beta male.<br /><br />Do you beta males want to know how women REALLY feel about you? Then listen up.<br /><br />When you are not around, do you want to know how women talk about you? They will say things like<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s so pathetic and weak, he always supports me in anything I do and never tries to discipline me&quot;.<br />&quot;He&#039;s such a pathetic man, he actually believes men and women are equal and should be treated as such&quot;.<br />&quot;He&#039;s so weak, he never tries to dominate me in bed, which is what I really desire&quot;.<br />&quot;He is so weak, I can easily control him and manipulate him to do anything I want&quot;.<br /><br />THAT is how women are really talking about you beta males. So being a nice guy, being a beta male, will NOT earn the respect of women. Women cannot stand men that they can easily push over.<br /><br />No, women want a REAL MAN, a strong man, a confident man who has his own personality and isn&#039;t a pathetic weakling that allows his woman to control him.<br /><br />I&#039;d highly recommend you guys, you manginas, you beta males, to stop being such a pussy, to GROW A PAIR OF BALLS, and to start acting like a real man.

				Yea, women can be bitches, and men can be assholes.&nbsp; It really sounds like you and Peter got fucked over by a couple of women, or maybe even a ton, and you hate all women because of it.&nbsp; They&#039;re not all how you&#039;re describing them, shit most of the women I know are against fucking feminism to the extreme you&#039;re taking it too.<br />

Are you really having that hard of a time understanding that the entire SYSTEM, especially the divorce courts and child custody courts are EXTREMELY BIASED AGAINST MEN?<br /><br />http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshha4LnH167phi0Z1VT<br /><br />That guy got ass raped in divorce. He was a good father, and was trying to pay child support, but the ex-wife was demanding huge unrealistic amounts and so he couldn&#039;t pay and lost his job, then got thrown in jail. Nevermind that his ex-wife is a rich lawyer herself and doesn&#039;t need the money.<br /><br />And don&#039;t try to act like this is an isolated incident. This happens extremely frequently. Just talk to any man who has been through a divorce, he will tell you how anti-male the legal system is.<br /><br />Another point is the frequency of false rape accusations. Women in the west are so full of shit, they will make a false rape accusation against you for no reason at all.<br /><br />And the reason the women are so out of control and insane is BECAUSE OF YOU FUCKING PUSSY-WHIPPED BETA MALE MANGINAS. You guys refuse to control your women and so they become out of control monsters.<br /><br />In the end, you faggots will get everything that you deserve. You morons are too fucking stupid to learn from other men&#039;s experience. No, you will have to get ass raped in divorce yourself before you WAKE THE FUCK UP.<br /><br />The majority of you men here are pathetic, spineless, little bitches. I could rip you in half with one hand.

				I got to the &quot;all women are liars&quot; part and it was easy to tell where that was going. You wanna talk about beta males, he is (and you are) a prime example. The key identifying feature is that they&#039;re all terrified of feminism and think it&#039;s destroying everything that was ever important. Much like the people who think gays, abortion, drugs, guns, religion, and shitty grammar are destroying everything that was ever important.<br /><br />Of course it&#039;s gonna sound like the truth to you, it&#039;s confirmation bias. Your damaged inner little boy wants to believe, so you take anecdotal evidence and try to leverage it as fact. To say nothing of the fact that all of your arguments boil down to &quot;ha, you disagree so I&#039;m manlier than you (and I totally have a bigger dick, I mean like, a HUUUUGE dick, horses ain&#039;t got nothin&#039; on me.

				I&#039;m late twenties, single and the older I get the less lonely and the more I feel like I dodged a bullet, or at least a firm pound to the head, because most men seem brain damaged to me based on the amount lying, manipulation, and outright extortion they endure from their significant other. I guess that cat can do it to ya.<br /><br />I for one feel like there should be more reason in the world, too many people live in fantasies, but, regardless of any reasonable argument, women these days want an astounding career, husband, and children, but no one can do all that at once.&nbsp; <br /><br />Women are no worse than men, but no better either. To them though equality doesn&#039;t seem to make sense, it&#039;s like you are either with them or against them, partner or opponent.

They should be always kind and loving, encouraging and supporting, humble, generous, and beautiful. They should listen and really understand me, always there when I need them, never hurtful or vindictive, but forgiving, faithful, and full of joy.&quot;<br /><br />God said, &quot;Alright, well I am God, so I can do that for you.&quot; Adam was elated.

Why don&#039;t you go ask what its like for a WOMAN who&#039;s married a powerful and well knowing MAN who calls up all the lawyers in town for no reason simply so they cant represent the wife, keeps the house, kids and everything else. You wouldn&#039;t understand the loss of something which grew inside you for 9 months and who you loved, cared and nurtured only to have it snatched away from you.

Because the church, &quot;society&quot;, and the media have potrayed women in the worst light possible and its all BULLSHIT but sheep like you think its the Bible. Feminism is good. I support feminism. More power to women. Pay them MORE than men. Our society is because of women....but its always been shown as the domain of man<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Three generations ago. Men who would be in their 90s to 110 years of age were they to be alive today fought in WW II. My step grand father, Frank Trainor, was one of those men who fought and was lucky enough to survive. When I was about 14 he sat me down and he told me some stories of his mates, his fallen comrades. He did not tell me these stories as examples of &quot;glory&quot;. It was very hard for him to tell me these stories because he relived those times as he told them. <br /><br />He told me of men who died next to him while he was spared. He told me stories of men who, fatally wounded, had to be left to bleed out slowly. He told me how the small jungle animals and flies would start eating their flesh even before they were dead. How the men, too weak to even move, knew they were being eaten by rats and mice and flies, and simply accepted this was their fate. To die in some foreign land having done the best they could do to protect the people of their homelands.<br /><br />He made the point that when he and his mates were fighting in the jungles across south east asia my parents were little children. My father being born in 1937 and my mother in 1939. He made the point that should it ever be my turn to do my bit then I must not dis-honour the memory of his fallen comrades. I must, like them, fight to the death to defend my loved ones and the people of my land. This is the message he passed to me. The message from his fallen comrades. That my parents had a great life because they were willing to fight and die. That I would have a chance of a great life because his comrades were willing to fight and die.<br /><br />The men of my grand fathers generation, the men of your great grand fathers generation, fought and died in large numbers to give your grand fathers generation, my fathers generation, a better chance in life. And what did your grand fathers and fathers do? The men of my fathers generation and my generation? They took the benefits of that chance themselves and then squandered it for their own children, the men of YOUR generation.<br /><br />As you can see if you check into my background I am now 49. My father is 75 soon to be 76. My former step children are 32 and 31. My alleged children are soon to be 22 and 20. I know that of which I speak. Men of my fathers generation and my generation &quot;fell asleep at the wheel&quot;. We were told there was a &quot;cold war&quot; and an &quot;external enemy&quot; and we fell for it. All the while traitors from within slowly introduced a tyranny that was hard to distinguish. Hard to understand.<br /><br />These traitors, who so loudly proclaim how hard they are working for us and how much they care about us, have been building the preparations for a police state that will make Communist Russia and China look like picnics. These traitors are called Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.&nbsp; There are others called Doctors and Psychologists and Priests and Ministers but they are less important and are having less influence than the Politicians, Lawyers, Police Officers, Bankers and Media Personalities.<br /><br />I &quot;blew the whistle&quot; on these criminals in 2008. I was gathering up evidence for the criminality of these collaborators and developing a remedy so that you, the next generation, could live in freedom and peace and prosperity. When I finally delivered that remedy in November 2009 and proved it in the Australian Federal Magistrates Court I expected your fathers and your grand fathers to rally and work with me to put an end to the criminal cartel known as &quot;guvments&quot; around the world.<br /><br />But a funny thing happened. Something that shocked me at the time. Your fathers and your grand fathers refused to work with me to stop the coming tyranny. They flatly refused. And the #1 reason they refused was &quot;the guvment might hurt me&quot;. <br /><br />I would tell them: &quot;It is certainly true that the guvment might hurt you. But the only reason you have ANYTHING that can be taken from you by your own gvument is because men died for you. Your fathers and your grand fathers died in the worlds bloodiest war so that you might have the chance to live in freedom. Now? When that very freedom is under threat again you are not willing to step up to the level of your fathers and grand fathers? You are not willing to do for your sons and grand sons what your fathers and grand fathers did for you?&quot;<br /><br />The answer has proven to be a resounding &quot;Yes. We are not willing to do for others what was done for us. The next generation can sort it out for themselves.&quot;<br /><br />I recall in late 2010 I flew over to Ireland to meet with the leadership of the Irish Freeman Site. My colleague and I put it to them that if their children and grand children are to live in freedom then they must stand up to their guvment and create new courts of law. The men said no. One among them was a new grand father. His grandson was a tiny baby. Just a few weeks old I was led to believe. So I asked him. &quot;You are a grand father. What are your plans? What will you do?&quot; His answer was &quot;When they come to my door I will take a few of them with me.&quot; <br /><br />So I asked him &quot;What about your grandson who is not able to defend himself?&quot;<br /><br />And his answer was &quot;He will have to look after himself.&quot;<br /><br />I looked at the man long and hard. I really, really eyeballed him. I finally said. &quot;That is your answer? You refuse to defend your grand son with everything you have?&quot; He did not break eye contact with me and just said &quot;Yes&quot;.<br /><br />There was nothing more to say. This came from an Irish Man. This came from a man who had lived in Freedom because of the Irish Men who fought the British. And here he was, willing to go eyeball to eyeball with me and tell me he would not do the same for his grand son. <br /><br />In that moment I saw that betrayal of the grand children is now acceptable for grand fathers and fathers alike.<br /><br />I can tell you. I was not very happy with that man. But he must make his own choices. <br /><br />I have talked to 10,000 such men, if not 100,000 such men. I do not know how many men of my generation, 49, and my fathers generation, 74, I have talked to because I have put posts into public spaces that could be read by any number of people.<br /><br />The message I can give to you young men of 18 to 30 is this. Your grand fathers and fathers are not going to help you. They are not going to work against the introduction of the tyranny that is coming for your benefit. They are openly condoning and supporting the introduction of the New World Order. They want you enslaved. They want you to be paying taxes in the future to pay for their &quot;welfare benefits&quot;. The vast majority of them are fully aware that there is a tyranny being introduced. The thousands that I talk to refuse to pass along the word of the coming tyranny pretending &quot;I don&#039;t believe you so I will not pass the word along&quot; when they know full well what is going on. They say they don&#039;t. But they absolutely know.<br /><br />They are betraying you because they know what is coming and they are doing nothing to stop it.<br /><br />Now. Just before I go into the next section I want to share with you something of my life because you might not read it in my books and it is important to this presentation. <br /><br />I have had a charmed life. Many people tell lies about me and say I am &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;bitter&quot; or any of a whole bunch of other lies. I was telling one of the boys I grew up next door to the other day that &quot;if I ever complained about my life you should just slap me one because I have had a better life than just about anyone else I know. Very few men get to live a life like me.&quot;<br /><br />I won the DNA lottery when it came to God handing out brains. Such is life. I got lucky. I was dux of my high school and I was awarded a scholarship for physics at the Australian National University. I turned it down because I had started my first job as a trainee programmer for a large company in Australia called Australian Iron and Steel. I was assigned to the programming team for the Plate Mill. This was the mill that made flat steel plate for things like ships, oil rigs, flooring in buildings, pipelines and the like. <br /><br />Of course, in 1982, deciding to be a software developer was a very risky decision. No one had any idea that software development was going to become the industry it became. We were paid pittances in those days and seen as &quot;propeller heads&quot;. We were much hated by the men on the factory floor as they saw us as taking their jobs off them with automation. A view they had much justification in having by the way.<br /><br />In 1985 IBM came to our university campus. I decided to go for a campus interview. I was dressed in my usual leathers for riding my motorbike which took the interviewer aback. I also had the requisite long hair and beard that university students have. He said that &quot;We at IBM are looking for the best of the best. We are looking for people who are great at what they do and know they are great at what they do.&quot; I told him that he was looking for me then. I told him I was the top programmer in my year at the university and the top programmer in my intake year for Australian Iron and Steel. I was very self confident. Something that less capable people like to call arrogant. People of lesser capability like to try and slur people of greater capability with the term &quot;arrogant&quot;. People of great capability almost NEVER use the word &quot;arrogant&quot; of anyone. If the person has the goods we admire them. If they do not have the goods but pretend they do we pity them because that is a terrible way to live.<br /><br />I got the job at IBM and I went into the International Software Development Centre in Sydney in 1986. I did my first overseas trip in November 1986. It was only to New Zealand but it was a start. Next year, in 1987, I went to Hong Kong for three months for IBM. I was asked to go straight on to Thailand for another two months but I was sick and I was burned out. In 88 I went to Malaysia for 8 weeks. My then fiancée finally put her foot down and demanded I quit the long trips. I did a few weeks in Taiwan to hand over my job and took a new job that did not require so much travel to placate my then fiancée. Big mistake by the way lads. If a woman EVER gives you an ultimatum like &quot;stop travelling or I will leave you&quot; then you MUST say &quot;Then go now, get out.&quot;&nbsp; Never, EVER give in to a woman&#039;s &quot;ultimatum&quot;. EVER. She will hate you for your weakness.<br /><br />I spent many years not travelling. But Jennifer was wasteful of money. She also quit work. So in 1996 I took a job at Hitachi Data Systems. One of the reasons they could not fill the position was the level of travel that would be required. The role was for the Business Development Manager for Asia Pacific for Business Intelligence. This would require massive amounts of travel going around Asia Pacific giving presentations to HDS customers so as to launch the Business Intelligence Practice. It was also a well paid position and I had four children and a wife to feed. So I took the job and told Jennifer she had no choice about the travel as she was refusing to work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />4 pages, 2075 words of horseshit propaganda having NOTHING to do with the topic.

If you tell me you&#039;ve never lied to the opposite sex and say so in full confidence, well then you sir or madame are lying to yourself. <br /><br />This is not to imply that everything they/we say to one another is a lie.

However, (I&#039;ll try to put this as neutrally as possible, I am neither a feminist nor a misogynist) there should be a paradigm shift overall.&nbsp; We&#039;ll probably never reach the star trek level of equality that would be in my mind ideal within my lifetime, but things should be different from how they currently are. <br /><br />On one side, I see that women do have problems in general with equality.&nbsp; You don&#039;t see very many successful women compared to the number of successful men, which is a problem.&nbsp; On top of that, when you see an attractive woman that is successful, oft times (from both genders) the perception is that that person got their success from their looks.&nbsp; The solution is not the feminism that is so popular in the US, as that just brings another set of problems.&nbsp; The issue is that until we can as a species get to the point where it really doesn&#039;t matter whether someone is male or female, this is going to be a problem, and that sort of paradigm only shifts over time.&nbsp; Cultures do evolve, but the process is slow. Generalizing people probably doesn&#039;t help either (saying that all women lie due to malicious intent, but men only due to ignorance is a fallacy and serves to do little more than show ones self as a misogynist)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well at least you admit that there is logic in what has been said here. Most people are so brainwashed by feminism that they can&#039;t even consider such things and outright reject them. Funny how liberals claim conservatives are closed minded.

But instead, we see that 99 percent of alimony payers are men. And, where is the feminist outcry about THIS inequality?<br /><br />Oh, it just affects men, and women could care fucking less about men. Therefore, it&#039;s a non-issue, just like male suicide is.<br /><br />Summary? Women could care less even if you kill yourself. Therefore, stop treating women with respect and treat them like the dogshit which they truly are.
