				ive got a few orders under my belt over the last year with no problems (knock on wood), but i have what might be a silly question.<br /><br />when something is on the way i usually clean house just to feel better.&nbsp; nothing incriminating and no scales or anything like that but my question is what exactly is on my laptop?<br /><br />im not tech savy at all and read on the forums as much as i can but to be honest alot of it is over my head.<br /><br />Tor, pgp software, and any other files relating to that are stored on a usb which i wont keep in my house when i have something on the way, but what else is on my laptop? obviously i have search history that wouldnt look to good if i was trying to dodge a charge.&nbsp; ecstacy related searches and visits to mt gox and such. also i try to use ccleaner and stuff like that but im sure theres traces on my machine of things. so my questions is what if i were to just remove the laptop from the house when something is on its way or switch it out for another one?&nbsp; does this look too suspicious? does it even matter at that point?&nbsp; anyone have any ideas on this?<br /><br />

				you could always leave your laptop in the microwave and that way if you do have a worry you could cook it for a minute and you&#039;re set :)

				I think your safest bet is just to use Liberte on a usb stick for all of your actions, then stash that while you&#039;re waiting to receive.&nbsp; If you want to make sure your windows machine is really clean, do a deep format and reinstall the OS. <br />The advantage of Liberte is that your user workspace is encrypted on the USB drive, and to even boot it requires your password.&nbsp; You could even just leave this in your house and hide it well, or break it if they come knocking ;)<br /><br /><br />btw liberte comes with all the tools you need

				Just because you have truecrypt DOES NOT mean you are safe. There&#039;s lots and lots of information that can still be pulled and if your encryption isn&#039;t secure enough it could be cracked in the snap of a finger if they really wanted to see what was on your hard drive. I&#039;d recommend what hojasanta said clean your entire hard drive do a fresh install of windows and then only go on tor through a linux live usb such as Tails or Liberte.&nbsp; &nbsp;
