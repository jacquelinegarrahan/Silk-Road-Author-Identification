				The seller asked me to reply on the forum board as well.<br /><br />I purchased 1 gram of cocaine from FrankMatthews. The first thing I always do is put the product on the scale. As advertised he/she sent me 1 gram. The packing was stealth.<br /><br />Now for the quality: The product was good. I must state this is not the same quality one can obtain in Bolivia, but for the price very nice. It had a bit of a sting in the nose, the smell was typical although a bit diluted. If you looked at it towards the light, you could see it sparkle a bit. The product did not completely numb the jaws and the throat, but you could feel &quot;easy&quot; numbness. Which is good thing because lidocaine/xylocaine is a stronger anesthetic than cocaine. The product also produced a nice high, which was not racy. I could also go sleeping after.<br /><br />All in all I recommend the vendor. I certainly will buy again.

				I agree with this positive feedback for FrankMatthews.<br />I order from a high risk country, where apparently only 70% max orders get through &amp; it can sometimes take up to 6 weeks if they do. Every order I have placed with Frank has arrived; &amp; all within 9-10days. This is testimony to his stealth. Having said that, I changed my postal address after more than 2 o/s orders didn&#039;t arrive. If you&#039;re having trouble with deliveries don&#039;t blame the vendor first - maybe your address is being monitored after the first was detected!<br />As for the gear; I love Frank&#039;s coke. As said above, it was not overly numbing, which made me suspicious at first, but the effect is lovely. Now this makes sense after reading the above. I&#039;ve been to parties in my country where there&#039;s loads of coke, but I take my own (Franks), &amp; when I make extra lines for people in the room there is generally exclamations of surprise &amp; then delight at the massive difference in quality from what we can get here.<br />I&#039;ve said it before, but I think I love you Frank :)
