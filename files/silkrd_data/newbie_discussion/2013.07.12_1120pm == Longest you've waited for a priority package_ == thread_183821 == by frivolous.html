				Hey guys, I live in the US and am wondering how long anyone has had to wait for a priority package before. I know USPS states 2-3 days, but sometimes they get backed up and take a little longer. Reason why I&#039;m asking is because I had a priority envelope sent to me marked &#039;in transit&#039; on Monday, and it now being Friday, is a no show&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve always received priority letters after 2 or 3 business days in the past, so I&#039;m wondering what gives. Has it been marked &#039;in transit&#039; but not mailed, has it been seized, or has anyone else been having a slow time with USPS lately?

				It should really have been there by now, don&#039;t get worried. I know it&#039;s hard when you expect your pakage and friday comes and no show, have a little faith.<br />10 days I once waited, and UPS give me compensation.

I hope they never opened and examined it, it seemed fine, anyway lets hope it really has been sent. good luck.

				I&#039;ve ordered over 300 Domestic priority packages through SR alone and thousands of legal items.&nbsp; 98% of the time it arrives in 2-3 days, I&#039;ve had a handful arrive 4 days and just 1 arrived 9 days after it was posted.

Maybe there are occasionally some 5 day packages? Either that or it was just prematurely marked &#039;in transit&#039;

Usually involving either snowstorms or usps putting it on the wrong plane to the wrong city. Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s coming.
