				A couple of my priority mail deliveries have had the number &quot;8&quot; in black felt tip written on the front, one with a check mark next to the number 8.&nbsp; the markings look to be made by postal workers enroute...&nbsp; Anyone else have experience with this or know whats up? Should I be worried?

				It&#039;s probably some method of routing. Even going down to a particular postal worker who uses that system on his own so the mail goes the right way because he&#039;s too drunk to remember.

				Thanks to all for the helpful replies.... I can&#039;t recall if I&#039;ve had any normal priority packages with this kind of marking... It&#039;s been a while for any of those kind of packages lol...&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes I probably wouldn&#039;t be on here asking about it if it was trouble... Another road delivery today via priority mail and there it was again with an &quot;8&quot; on it....&nbsp; Thanks all.
