				Ahoy,<br /><br />In the spirit of the Dread Pirate Roberts, when one leaves the next takes his place.&nbsp; I am an an old member of both SR and this forum, but for security I have created a new account.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there will be time to go through the 50 post limit, so I am posting this here.&nbsp; I would thank any members for re-posting around the forum.<br /><br />I am in the midst of setting up a new server infrastructure and forum to take this ones place if it gets taken down.&nbsp; The new forum will be modeled after this one, and also include a market place section where members can both buy and sell.<br /><br />This will be securely hosted, and ever precaution is being taken to avoid the downfall of the original SR.&nbsp; I will also be coding a new market from scratch, though it will take several days.<br /><br />Our unity gives us strength, lets not let them take it from us.<br /><br />I will have more info shortly.<br /><br />Forum is now live at http://blackiiw5nozs6i5.onion<br /><br />-Dread Pirate Roberts

				Why is no one being skeptical? Can you not give us any proof? It seems pretty entertaining to log on and pretend you&#039;re the new DPR. Hell I&#039;d probably do it if I had thought of it first. Can you get another Hero Member that&#039;s active right now to verify?

				I&#039;m skeptical but interested, I&#039;ll be following you closely.&nbsp; I agree with the sentiment you shouldn&#039;t take over the moniker DPR, it&#039;s too soon as of yet.&nbsp; As of now, I have no reason to trust your site an ounce.&nbsp; In the sake of conspiracy I&#039;m going to guess you might be StExo, who I see to be technologically knowledgeable, a businessman at heart, and heavily invested in the black market.&nbsp; Plus he&#039;s the almost the definition of &quot;an an old member of both SR and this forum&quot;

				Anyone going to vouch for this guy? Really hoping this is a legit plan B! At this point it is and will simply be an idea unless you can get OLD members, trusted vets to stand behind you... otherwise you simply have a dream and you know what happened to the last guy who had a dream. Look your plan looks great but at this point we all need TRUST! LE could post 10 of these or could already have BMR in pocket waiting for everyone to migrate... point blank you need someone to say you are who you say you are!

				One thing to consider when weighing up the chances of lE doing a honeypot site is what can they really get out of it, just records of what is sent where without names or addresses, just usernames and self declared countries. As long as pgp is used at best the information is good for helping to identify people from RL by cross referencing information.

				If someone, or some group of savvy individuals were to put together a newer, better version of the Road, with redundancies and safeguards in place that would avoid a situation like DPR and others have gotten into AND would be located in a country with no extradition (similar structure to what some of the popular torrent sites that are still around do) I&#039;d be willing to invest coin in doing do and give any kind of support, as i&#039;m sure others would too. <br /><br />Long live freedom and FUCK LE and especially the useless DEA. <br /><br />

				^ yeah that is the plan to have safeguards in place to run it like the real DPR that if one is gone another DPR is replaced this is actually how I thought DPR was running it so I didn&#039;t even bother to make a site to compete with SR but since it&#039;s down........&nbsp; I was thinking of making it like a democracy that we can vote in the congress/house of commons but the headmasters will always stay the same for extra safety that way we can do what the people want. -DFS <br />

				Will be keeping my eye on the OP&#039;s new site. Failing that I guess I will see y&#039;all over at Sheep Marketplace. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t the last of SR, don&#039;t believe it for a second. The war on drugs is being won.....by us! Chins up&nbsp; ;)

				I am actually working on a new (tor hidden) site too. But I plan to release the full source code, for collaboration and peer-review on github (of the fully legal bitcoin marketplace software which will be used to run the server).&nbsp; I started working on it some time back, but will rewrite most parts from scratch for security reasons. I have a server infrastructure where I am able to host the site. <br /><br />I was active on the old sr too, and in the forum. but changed to a new username now because user data is most likely in the hands of the feds.&nbsp; I will update here again (unless the 50 post rule gets removed).<br /><br />Github link, detailed plan of implementation and onion address will follow soon:<br /><br />EDIT: Github is up and running https://github.com/druglizard/grand-bazaar&nbsp; &nbsp;(keep things legal there, this is just the market software, and access only over TOR)<br /><br />Site will be here: http://bazaar3lm7zquskq.onion

				At an absolute minimum, the new market will need to be designed with Kerchoff&#039;s principle in mind - even if entire server(s) and source code are seized or compromised, nothing major must be retrievable without knowing the private keys of the admin or individuals users.<br /><br />In the NSA, there is a design philosophy that for every gadget X, the very first production copy gets sent straight to Kremlin.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking that supplying a PGP key should be a mandatory piece of registration info for PMs (unless the user doesn&#039;t want access to PMs).&nbsp; That way, if a user messages a vendor or another user, the message gets encrypted with their public key before being sent (preferably the user would do it themselves before it going out on the wire).&nbsp; The recipient will get a bunch of ASCII gibberish that they can then decrypt to get the real message.&nbsp; PITA for sure, but the fallout from SR seizure would&#039;ve been FAR, FAR, FAR less if user communications weren&#039;t stored and sent in cleartext.<br /><br />If you look at the affidavit, the feds would&#039;ve had practically nothing on DPR except the fake IDs if the seized server image didn&#039;t spill all the beans.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I&#039;m not too keen on SM or BMR right now.&nbsp; Redesigning security infrastructure like this takes weeks, if not months - and that&#039;s if you have developers well-versed in security.

				Don&#039;t trust ANYTHING for a short while until things are a bit clearer man.<br /><br />If you&#039;re gonna trust anything for buying or what not then i&#039;d consider BMR.<br /><br />As many have said, it is time tested and has withstood the war on drugs up until now but then again I wouldn&#039;t place 100% faith in anything for now. The truth about how DPR got caught may not be known to anybody but the feds for all we know and we don&#039;t know to believe what they say in the media as they may be just making it look like he fucked up so other buyers/vendors keep things rolling without knowing that feds have access to hidden sites like SR/BMR/SM.<br /><br />Best to just sit back, partake in these forums and gather as much knowledge about the situation for now and hopefully in a few days our options will be more clearer.<br /><br />Peace out and stay safe,<br />Evoc

Don&#039;t you think there&#039;s better places for it to be advertised than these forums?<br /><br />Firstly, people need assurance from some senior members that you are legit because they way it stands at the minute you could be absolutely anyone.<br />Supposing you are (as you say) a senior member under a new alias, I highly doubt you would be posting this info on forums which are 150% being monitored by feds.<br /><br />

				I think it would be wisest if there were multiple people working on multiple versions that do NOT collaborate. Eggs in one basket, you know...<br /><br />In fact, it might be wise to have coders being different people from server hosts. Obviously there are trust issues involved with staying anonymous but we&#039;re all smart people here and can figure something out. Maybe share code in an opensource format to check for bugs etc and then whoever wants to take the risk of hosting can just use the code and then has to build trust with their own website from there.<br /><br />Fuck, if we had the SR code we could just duplicate it every time one goes down as long as we can get a temporary host up. It&#039;s the hosting that&#039;s risky. Obviously the FEDs have a way of locating servers with some kind of crazy NSA botnet and it might not even be feasible to run hidden services anymore. KEEP IN MIND THEY LOCATED THE SR SERVER IN JULY. <br /><br />Stay safe brave programmers and internet enthusiasts. And don&#039;t make any of the n00b-tard mistakes DPR made. Read the FBI warrants (there&#039;s at least 2) and pay attention to how he fucked up (that&#039;s probably only half of his actual fuck-ups) before you even THINK about running another SR-like hidden service.<br /><br />Also, might be wise to only allow small-time vendors and buyers (cap on the amounts of products) in order to make it not worth their time and build trust. DPR fell for a n00b trap of an LEO undercover offering kilos of cocaine and ended up fucking over a vendor that turned and he later tried to have killed. DON&#039;T TRY TO BUY KILOS OF COCAINE OVER TOR BECAUSE IT&#039;S RETARDED!<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />

				Were there really no back up procedures if someone in the SR team were arrested, or just DPR himself?<br /><br />Just seems very loosely organized, thought it would&#039;ve been common knowledge to think &quot;Ok IF we&#039;re compromised, the back up server elsewhere comes online&quot;.

				Well, I believe that the technical and organizational problems with setting up a SR 2.0 (or whatewer else) can all be solved. In the best case it will be designed again, from the scratch.<br /><br />But the crucial point is the TRUST. How would you trust the new markets, that they are not operated by the NSA itself? NSA can set up a new market in few hours or days - they have the SR source code and the bitcoins they seized, so it would be a piece of cake for them.<br /><br />Can anyone actually prove that he does not belong to the dark side? No, it can not be done. Therefore, we can not trust anyone, right?<br /><br />Right. The future SR2 must be designed in a way that will allow the buyers and sellers making their trades without the market operator knowing about the trade content. Hard to do? Yes. Impossible? No. <br /><br />Only the &quot;untrusted&quot; market operators who do not require us to trust them can be trusted. What a paradox.

				I am considering a SR alternative for maybe half year, just for the introduction. And from my perspective, I would NEVER invited anyone from public forum into my team. Just because half of them will be an NSA agents. The second half may be legitimate, but still you do not know them - they may be desperate junkies, drunkers, loose lips or whatever else, what you do not want in your team. <br /><br />Strictly speaking, an anonymous public forum is the last place where to look for a team members for such sensitive project. So do not hold your breath, no one will be invited - and for a good reason. Or if somebody actually will be invited, it will be a good reason to abandon such project completely as it is probably compromised from the very beginning.
