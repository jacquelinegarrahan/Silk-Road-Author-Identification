				I recently ordered some LSD from the vendor &quot;James Brown&quot;.<br /><br />The communication was excellent and shipping was lightning fast and stealth enough to not raise any eyebrows. After all it is just paper being shipped, not difficult to hide at all.<br /><br />After receiving I was amped to try it but had to find the right day. Now let me preface this by saying I have done quite a bit of LSD in my day. First time was in my teens through my 20&#039;s. Tried various ingestion methods, Blotter, Microdots, sugar cubes. Then I went without for quite a stretch. I am now in my 40&#039;s and had been missing the feeling so I found SR. <br /><br />So anyway, I took one hit initially simply because it had been so long since I took it and was unsure of how my body would react. The one hit gave me a nice alert feeling, the sensation of tripping without a full blown trip, if that makes any sense. I was happy with the test results.<br /><br />I like to trip alone unless I have someone who will trip with me, I have never had a need or desire for a babysitter while doing it.<br /><br />So a week later I drop 2 hits and let me just say that this was incredible. It took about 20-30 minutes to start feeling the effects and withing an hour I was full blown tripping. Colors became extremely vivid, with some tracer effect. I had a football game on the TV for background noise and when I looked at it I was mesmerized. The HD picture was completely 3D to me and when the players were running it was almost slow motion but yet still in real time. I bounced around between listening to music, surfing the web and watching movies. The Matrix on LSD is a deeply insightful movie.&nbsp; Sort of a sensory overload. I went out into my yard and watched the stars for a little while and contemplated the many wonders of the universe. Needless to say I enjoyed every aspect of the trip. I think it overall lasted roughly 9-10 hours and I was 100% happy with the&nbsp; quality and overall experience.<br /><br />Just ordered more and am looking forward to my next trip.<br />
