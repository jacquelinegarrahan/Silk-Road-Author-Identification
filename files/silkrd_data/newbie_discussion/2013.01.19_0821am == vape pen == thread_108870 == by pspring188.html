				So whos got a vape pen? which ones do you like?<br /><br />I went with the omicron v2, when it works, its friggin awesome, but ive had a few issues with it over the last month. could be user error or just poor design/communication, im not sure yet.<br /><br />I saw a video on an e-skillet today, looks like another ego-t. there are so many out there<br /><br />looking for recommendations, i thought I had the omicron figured out and then it looks like I blew 4 carts tonight!<br />goal is to not smoke flowers :)

				Read a ton of reviews, man. Some awesome looking things / novel ideas are actually crappy IRL. I hear the Puffit Fake Inhaler is awesome, but sucks in functionality compared to the MFLB.

				I have a MFLB, it was the first vape I tried after being a daily smoker for awhile (preference were bongs), it does the job and also is very good stealth wise, very portable. But after about a month it began to satisfy me less and less and I found every so often when I&#039;d smoke a bong I&#039;d feel like I was missing out and kinda wasting my weed. But for health reasons I really wanted to like vaping so I took the plunge and bought a desktop vape: The Da Buddha, hoping that it would give me those strong hits when I wanted them, happy to say it definitely does and I hardly ever smoke anymore.<br /><br />I still have the MFLB, I keep it for when I want a portable solution, don&#039;t get me wrong it does the job if you are an occasional herb user but for a regular user I found it&#039;s only good for so long and not to be used as a primary device. I read all the reviews before I purchased it and a lot of people seem to say that it gets the job done as well as a desktop vape (or a higher end portable vape? not sure haven&#039;t tried any others) but it really doesnt, you can get clouds out of it but definitely not as big clouds as a good desktop vape.

				yes i have smoked from a vape pen..they are for oil.. all depends on how good your oil is.. purchased from a club you are prob good to go.. but some states dnt have weed clubs.. either way i dont smoke weed anymore.. they work though.. let heat up..light turns blue.. you should get some smoke if no smoke then its not hot enough and most likely you wont get a rip slash get high.. def works though i remember before i left for a flight i hit my buddies vape pen a few times and got pretty lit...as for someone saying bong.. when i burned my preferred method of smoking was out of a bong.. mult chamber shit.. and i didnt like smoking oil directyl through the pan or w/e im sick of hearing this dabs shit...i always thoughti got must high if i put weed in the bowl with my extracts and straight torched that bitch whole way through.. bong load competitions....
