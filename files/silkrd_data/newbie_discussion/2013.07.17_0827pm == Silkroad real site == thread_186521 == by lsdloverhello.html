				You were smart to ask, seriously! That&#039;s the right url, you&#039;re all good. I recommend memorising it. I always think silkroad very best #5 pizer with onion, but I&#039;m totally insane, AB.

				Love your play on words fellas, I think I be one of those who need to bookmark it though! <br />Is the Hidden Wiki usually a phishing scam link for SR?<br /><br />

				Bookmarking it is the best idea.. also never ever follow the link from the Hidden Wiki or anywhere else.&nbsp; 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s a scam site.&nbsp; You should NEVER have to use your pin to login to SR.

Side note QLD police did confiscate 2 computers with this set up on it in the last 18 months and found no trace of the hidden virtuals.<br /><br />That said, I am with AB as well, wouldn&#039;t bookmark anything that can ruin your reasonable doubt image unless you know it can not be found or connected.

As long as you aren&#039;t selling/buying in high quantities and are a small time buyer/dealer you should be ok and shouldnt worry about the 5-0 coming to take your stuff and using your laptop as evidence against you. Unless you are looking at some really messed up stuff like cp and other shit you should get busted for I think bookmarking is ok. Unless there is another reason Im not aware of?
