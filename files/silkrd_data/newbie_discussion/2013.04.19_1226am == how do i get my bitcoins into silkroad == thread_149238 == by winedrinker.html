				Go to silk road onion located here - &gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />Sign in with your silk road account.<br /><br />Click at the top, where you see &#039;account&#039; . This will bring you to a page. If you read down some, you will see : to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address: (here will be a unique address, unique to your account)<br /><br />When you use your bitcoin wallet to send the bitcoins to that address, they will then appear in your silk road account. It can take a few hours sometimes

				Send bitcoin from where ever you bought it to the bitcoin address in your account. cut and paste SR btc(bitcoin) address into the site or person you bought btc from and that person or site will send the bit coin to SR. :D

				welcome to SR, take your time reading wikipedia guide on SR, as well as searching the forums.<br /><br />In few words things are like these. <br />1.You buy bitcoins using an exchange site. (pm to suggest a couple) <br />2. You transfer the BTC to BTC address that you already have once you have made an account at silkroad.<br />3. You wait, see the amount of BTC on your silk road account, and you are ready to order.<br /><br />Be careful with bitcoin it is not a stable currency. Usually it goes up, as more people get into BTC exchanging. So if you want to buy something that costs 100 dollars, deposit 150, just to be sure, even in a 50% crash. (If not, the rest of the money you will use them with your next order, cause once you make your first order, you will go for another , again and again :D)&nbsp; &nbsp;you can buy the product you wanted at first, because the prices at SR are fixed at USD, and the BTC amount that you need usually changes, but has the same Value in USD. <br /><br />I suggest you go to your account page at SR, choose to see prices in dollars.<br /><br />Hope i helped,

				hello surmer,<br />Not sure what you mean (I assume you are referring to my inexperience).&nbsp; I&#039;d rather give sllk road a try then face the hazards of a gun at my head in the areas I&#039;ve tried to make purchases in the past.

				It&#039;s way to easy. Go to bitinstant, follow instruction and put the destination as your SR wallet. Most people freakout but SR tumbles coins, and BITCOINS AREN&#039;T ILLEGAL.
