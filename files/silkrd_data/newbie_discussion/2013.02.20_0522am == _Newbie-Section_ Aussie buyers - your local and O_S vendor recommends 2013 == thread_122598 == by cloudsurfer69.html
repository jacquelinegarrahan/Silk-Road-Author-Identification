These vendors that are charging higher than normal are price gouging, there are benefits to it and it is completely fair because of this: There is a low barrier to entry, It does not cost an arm and a leg to set up shop here, it is far from a monopoly. If you can sell half ounces of weed for lower than $260 then do it.<br />Ey! even if you did not know a connection in real life you could buy an elbow from someone on SR and re-sell it. <br />Does this not make sense?<br />Do you guys feel like the current Aussie weed vendors on SR are acting like an oligopoly by all setting high prices?<br />There is plenty of green here, and plenty of it could be sold for less than $260 for an half ounce.<br />The opportunity to jump in and undercut is there and the demand must be there because I do see a lot of complaints about this while people are still buying from these higher priced vendors<br />

Consider if we use spendbitcoins.com or similar we pay 10% commission, the vendor then loses 8% to SR comission, and then i suppose they lose another 10% cashing out bitcoins to cash? So say a vendor gets close to 30% less than how much it costs us to buy (please update me if this is correct.<br /><br />So for a listing costing $260, it actually costs us $260 + 10% = $286. Vendor would get $260 - 18% = $210 approx?<br /><br />$210 does not seem TOO outrageous to me, but perhaps as buyers are paying the 10% commission buying the bitcoins it seems fair that the vendor can cover the costs of cashing out bitcoins (10%) in their margin, and both vendor and buyer go halves in the SR commission?<br /><br />If the above was the case, buyers would be paying $210 + 14% = $240, and vendor would cashout $210 - 14% = $180.<br /><br />I think the vendors are charging buyers all the extra costs at the current listings prices....perhaps with a bit more vendor competition we would see vendors willing to cover some of the commission costs? At this stage tho, I think the high prices really are reflecting the fact that buyers are covering all the lost commission costs. <br /><br />

				<br />The weedman sells 14g for $120, which is by far the best price/weight for Aussie vendors I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; Of course, this means that his listings tend to run out in minutes; you have to jump on it when you see it (maybe keep some drop offs encrypted with his pubkey just to paste in fast before the vultures finish it).&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him a couple of times, but only managed to get an order in once before they disappeared.

				Whilst everyone agrees that the price of weed is crazy at the moment ... It will encourage more vendors onto SR and eventually prices will fall !<br /><br />Vendors concerned about Bit coin commission costs should maybe look at selling Bit coins through localbitcoins.com ...<br /><br />

				Just going to pop a quick note in here - would recommend staying away from MarijuanaIsMyMuse.<br /><br />He&#039;s massive with quality stuff and good communication but I&#039;ve had a heap of stuff not rock up, or be well overdue currently. Something is going on his side, profiling/not sending/some kind of flag and his stuff is not making it right now. Will update when/if it arrives but currently 3 orders to 3 fresh addresses all overdue.

Nice gear and a professional service. :)<br /><br />cloudsurfer69, why start another Aussie thread???&nbsp; ::) This section is here for new members to ask questions or start threads in relation to learning the basics on using SR safely. There has been a stack of Aussie threads, way too many, and Mod SSBD created the new one as the others had got out of hand. Stop rushing to get to 50 posts and instead take the time to learn as per the wishes of the Admins!!<br /><br />PS - techenergy&#039;s account was closed and banned due to scamming a while ago.&nbsp; :P
