				What up SR<br />I&#039;m goin to be buying a quarter of some sweet mj from thebudfather tomorrow, but I can&#039;t have it shipped to my house. So basically I have to put the address as GENERAL DELIVERY and I have to go to the post office when it arrives and just show picture ID. <br /><br />Wondering if this is going to add any chance of gettin caught, or if anyone has done this before

				why cant you have it delivered to your home?<br /><br />other options, rent a PO box. ask a friend if you can have pot shipped to their house. ask a stupid friend if you can have &#039;a computer part&#039; shipped to their house. ask your grandma to borrow her mailbox/mailing address. i wouldnt suggest &quot;general delivery,&quot;&nbsp; i havent heard of that method and i wouldn&#039;t do it, personally.

				I can&#039;t have it shipped to my house on account of still living with my parents, and them being complete nazis. I&#039;ve used GD before, just not for weed, only for weed paraphernalia and everything went smoothly.<br /><br />

				how old are you? if you get caught with some buds, what can your parents actually do?<br /><br />do you never order anything online? would they open your mail if you told them you were expecting something innocuous, like a computer part or a gift for a friends&#039;&nbsp; birthday or SOMEthing? <br /><br />personally i wouldnt have my federal offense mail sent to just.. the post office. at least get a PO box.

				Alright well I&#039;m 19. And the reason I fear having it sent to my house is because I have heard, that n rare occasions, if the package is found to have something in it it&#039;s not supposed to, someone will knock on the door and get someone to sign for it. This is a problem because my dad works at home and would most likely be the one to open the door and sign. Also, since he works at home, he always has packages coming in to te house so there&#039;s a chance he may open it without realizing its mine. I don&#039;t want to risk getting kicked out or having to start paying rent for a few grams of bud.

				what youre talking about is a controlled delivery, and it&#039;s extremely uncommon. in the event youre the victim of a controlled delivery, you&#039;ve got much bigger things to worry about than your parents knowing you have some buds.<br /><br />i would strongly suggest having your weed mailed to your own address; this lessens the chance of anything going awry. i would say that using &quot;General Delivery&quot; would probably increase the chance of someone noticing your packages&#039; stinky contents.<br /><br />i would suggest that you let your parents know you&#039;re expecting a package so they dont open your mail.

				Can u go a little more into detail about controlled delivery and how it&#039;s going to give me more of a chance of getting caught. Just curious, not trying to be a dick

				I would find a friend who lives on their own or who has parents working day jobs so they can be the first one at the mailbox, promise them a gram, and have it shipped there.

				Honestly, you can have anything shipped to your house on mistake. Where you&#039;re going to the office, it&#039;s pretty obvious you were expecting something..

Could be a present from a friend in Cali for Father&#039;s Day:).&nbsp; But honestly do you think there is much chance of me getting caught. It&#039;s 7gs of weed that&#039;s going to be professionally packaged, is being shipped through USPS and being held at USPS which is important because they are really the only ones who need to obtain a warrant to even look through my package, and also, they don&#039;t know when I&#039;m coming in to pick it up. Would they really stake out the post office for 30 days just for 7gs of bud...
