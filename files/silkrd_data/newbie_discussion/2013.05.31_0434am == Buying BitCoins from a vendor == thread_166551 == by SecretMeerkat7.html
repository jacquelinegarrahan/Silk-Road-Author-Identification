				There&#039;s a vendor on SR who&#039;s selling BitCoins, among other things.&nbsp; He says to go buy a MoneyPak and load the money onto it, then give him the info on the back of the card and he&#039;ll put BitCoins into my account with only a 2.5% rate.&nbsp; Is this safe?&nbsp; Sounds too easy/good to be true.

				Have you done a search of the vendors name on the forums to see if they have any reviews?<br /><br />If its a new vendor then i would be suspect but if its an established vendor with feedback and reviews that backup their legit then you should be ok! You will get no help from SR if you do get scammed tho as they do not support bitcoin sales!

				Silk Road recommends that you do not purchase your Bitcoin from a vendor / exchanger on Silk Road; please see the following SR Wiki entries regarding this:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Getting_Bitcoins<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I_need_help_with_a_bitcoin_transaction_from_a_Silk_Road_vendor.<br /><br />Libertas

				A review was just posted on his site from someone who very happily received their BitCoins and gave him a 15/5 (lol).&nbsp; Maybe I will trust my instinct and go through with it, it certainly does seem to be the most convenient method I&#039;ve come across.&nbsp;
