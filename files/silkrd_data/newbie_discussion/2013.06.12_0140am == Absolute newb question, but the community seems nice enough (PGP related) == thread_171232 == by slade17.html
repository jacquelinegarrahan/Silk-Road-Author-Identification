				So, I know PGP is a way to encrypt messages so that a third party couldn&#039;t read them. I have a few questions about this.<br /><br />First of all, how common is this to use? I&#039;m about to make my first order, and I&#039;d like to follow suit. If I send the vendor an encrypted message, is he going to be like, &quot;the fuck is this?&quot; Also, in what way would I use it? Like, would I use it to send my name and address? Finally, could somebody link me to a tutorial on how to do it (if it&#039;s necessary I learn for VERY occasional purchases)?<br /><br />I&#039;m admittedly being a little lazy since I&#039;m sure I could find the answers with more searching around, but Tor is unbearably slow on my laptop and thought I&#039;d give this a shot instead.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />

				You should use PGP for both your and your vendor&#039;s protection. Some vendors want to use it, some couldn&#039;t care less.<br /><br />Personally for what is a little effort (when you&#039;re up to speed) I think you should always use it when communicating with your vendor on SR, either when sending them a message that has personally identifiable/liable content, or always when your providing your mailing address in the shopping cart/buying page.<br /><br />Are you using a PC or Mac and I&#039;ll dig out some instructions for you.

I&#039;m a Mac user so can&#039;t be of specific help as PGP (known as GPG) works a little differently on a Mac:<br /><br />**NB: THESE ARE NORMAL/CLEARNET LINKS**<br /><br />http://aplawrence.com/Basics/gpg.html<br />http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/pgp-begin.html<br />http://www.queen.clara.net/pgp/pgp.html<br />http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2008-September/034645.html<br /><br />Essentially the routine is you copy your recipients Public Key and import this into PGP.<br /><br />Now create a message and save it as a text file.<br /><br />Back in PGP (which is usually a terminal/CMD command line program) you encrypt the text file using the public key. The public key is usually identified by an email address displayed when importing the key.<br /><br />During the encryption process, look for an option called &#039;amour&#039; which ensures the outputted encrypted file of your message is in ASCII rather than binary so it can be opened in a text editor and copied and pasted into your SR message, address box, email, etc.<br /><br />Hope it helps...

Definatley worth using, but if you get stuck, as a questing in the newbie thread and someone will help.

				It is pretty cool that we have access to military grade encyrption, might as well use it. ROT13 is good too.

Then the vendor uses their private key to decrypt.<br /><br />There&#039;s a web site that I&#039;ve seen mentioned, it appears to do the encryption using Javascript (which should help keep your message more secure since it isn&#039;t making a round trip to the server to send your unencrypted message to be encrypted), at www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGpubkey.htm (NOTE clearnet link!)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
