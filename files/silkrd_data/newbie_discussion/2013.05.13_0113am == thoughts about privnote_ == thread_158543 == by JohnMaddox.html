				I&#039;ve seen some posts maybe in signatures at random that warn against using privnote.&nbsp; It is partially why I spent so much time looking into gpg encryption.&nbsp; Prior to learning how to use gpg encryption privnote seemed like a good idea for quick and easy encryption.&nbsp; I can only think of one reason privnote would be bad and would like to hear from others what reasons they have for not using it.&nbsp; For me it is a third party that can read any message you send therefore security is compromised.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen top vendors recommend it on the main SR page so it seems there are some conflicting opinions about using it.

				I wouldn&#039;t use it. You have to trust the privnote service and the medium you&#039;ve sent the message through, while with PGP you only need to trust that you&#039;ve got the real public key.<br /><br />Asynchronous cryptography is tried and tested, the only thing more secure than it is to use a one-time pad. Using it is as simple as clicking &quot;encrypt clipboard&quot;, so why would you use less security when the option to be completely secure is one click away?

				I think I may have more or less answered my own question I was just curious to see if others had different reasons for not using it.&nbsp; If anything this post may be informative for other newbies considering the &quot;easy&quot; way out.

				It is sensitive information, but the thing is, nobody at privnote knows why you are encrypting the information, who you are or who you are sending the link for the information to<br /><br />As far as they can see, its just an address, which could be encrypted for any number of reasons<br /><br />Yes there are many arguments as to why it is unsafe. But is it really a threat? I think not and I have used it, before I learned how to use PGP<br /><br />The thing is, PGP is a bit daunting if you have never heard of it before.... a big paragraph of random letters and numbers looks so confusing and is enough to put people off, at least it did me<br /><br />But when you actually know how to use it, its really really simple<br /><br />I followed this video tutorial once and now everything is crystal clear:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SywCI91kfq0
