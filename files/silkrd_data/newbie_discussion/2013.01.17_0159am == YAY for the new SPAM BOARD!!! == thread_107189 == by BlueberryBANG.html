It&#039;s pretty clear I&#039;m not a scammer if you read my posts&nbsp; :)<br /><br />And there&#039;s this dude postin called &#039;Imfcknscared&#039;&nbsp; or something like this who I&#039;ve already posted my suspicions about in a thread about him having 5 KILOS of HASH in the mail he&#039;s too scared too collect<br /><br />And just a few hours ago he makes a thread asking &quot;who got the best kilos of kush on SR?&nbsp; &nbsp;and people are answering!&nbsp; :o :o&nbsp; &nbsp;this person REEKS OF LE&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />If he hasn&#039;t collected his hash AND mentioned so in his thread he started asking for &#039;advice on what to do&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; FFS&nbsp; this IS&nbsp; SOP&nbsp; fo LEO&#039;s trying to find out &quot;who&quot; is selling&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;unlisted large amounts&quot;<br /><br />now.........&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EVERYONE&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BE WARNED&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PHISHING SCAMS!!!<br /><br />It IS POSSIBLE LE HAVE SOME TOR OUTLET NODES out of the thousands out there...... here&#039;s an example that many noobs including myself fell for when I first tried to get on the Road<br /><br />&nbsp; I got the SR name from a clearweb post and I had tor so I used a tor SE to get the address, typing in &quot;silk road&quot;&nbsp; to the Ixqik SE gave me this link<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/silkroad/home&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;can you see the diference??&nbsp; this is the correct addy&nbsp; =&gt;&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home &lt;=<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;there&#039;s a &quot; .to/&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; added to the first address&nbsp; <br /><br />AND IT DIVERTS YOU THROUGH THIS&nbsp; ADDRESS!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.onion.to/enter.php?entryurl=J9r4gK6-UARU6xDkh1rLHVV13cq_dhkAlf_xqAJGGB8S<br /><br />suffice to say as soon as I saw this, I logged back into SR with this suffix disabled and&nbsp; &nbsp;CHANGED EVERYTHING significantly, tripling my password strengths etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;As it was a brand new account with no coin in it or trades, I didn&#039;t actually delete the whole account, but shit IF I had been trading through this I sure would!<br /><br />I reported all this stuff to SR support who told me ANY ADDRESS that is ANYTHING other than this one&nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/home&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp; IS NOT SAFE OR ANONYMOUS!<br /><br />IDK&nbsp; but it&#039;s clear traffic is being rerouted via this&nbsp; &nbsp;.to/&nbsp; node&nbsp; IS going through another server which CAN collect certain data IF it is the final server in the TOR chain, and the weak link in the chain<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; IF this was an LE &#039;comtrolled/operated&#039; node, they MAY be getting some data they can use&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; SO BE WARNED&nbsp; &nbsp; going through this node sometimes makes logins harder,&nbsp; you might get &#039;error 400&#039; messages and have to reload the page to get through,&nbsp; this seems to be the most common &#039;problem&#039; associated with this node.&nbsp; Also it will reject your captchas a few times making you re-enter another one... :-\&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are having these problems, have a look at the address in your addressbar and check it carefully for any variations on the correct address I have listed, and IF it is, change everything asap!<br /><br />Please be careful my friends....I know if I&#039;d had coin at the time I probably wouldn&#039;t have noticed this mistake and gone on to..???&nbsp; idk what, but it&#039;s NOT kosher friends, whatever it is!<br /><br /><br />Good luck and be careful everyone...read read read the advice on the forums...knowledge IS power, the power to keep you safe<br /><br /><br />Sweet Dreams everyone&nbsp; mysty

				Well.... I&#039;m kinda confused. Are we supposed to spam as noobs? Or are we supposed to actually make viable posts to things, and people just spam in the noob boards, because they are largely unmoderated or the spamming isn&#039;t enforced against here, or whatever reason?
