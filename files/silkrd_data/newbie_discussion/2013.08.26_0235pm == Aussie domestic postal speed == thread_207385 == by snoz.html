				I wish I could post this in &quot;the Australian thread&quot; but since I&#039;m still a noob its gotta go here.<br />A couple of people have commented on the slower speed of domestic mail in Australia in the last few days asking if anyone else has noticed a slow down.<br />Well, I have a family member who delivers mail on the postie bikes in regional NSW and she told another family member last week that Australia Post is not making enough money on deliveries so management has decided that mail delivery workers will not be allowed to work overtime (in order to contain costs). <br />She said this means that no matter how many letters and parcels need to be delivered when the postie has worked their standard shift hours they must return to the post office with any mail they have not delivered where it will remain until going out the next day.<br />She said overall the Aust postal service remains as effecient as normal ( ie: mail being sorted and trucked interstate) but the bottleneck is at the delivery to individual addresses.<br />She said she expects complaints to start coming in within the next few weeks...<br />I would appreciate it if someone who can post in the aussie thread would copy and paste this there, thanks!
