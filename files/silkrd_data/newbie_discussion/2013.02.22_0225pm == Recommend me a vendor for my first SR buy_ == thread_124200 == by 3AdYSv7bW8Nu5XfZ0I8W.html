				Hi guys, i&#039;m looking for a hash vendor that has good stuff and with which i&#039;ll be able to finish the whole transaction (~1g + worldwide shipping) for a max of 1 BTC.<br />Also, someone who won&#039;t force me to FE :(<br /><br />Anyone knows if such a seller exists?

				If I were a vendor I would be weary of anybody with a buyer&#039;s name like that&nbsp; :o<br /><br />My best advice is to just search the road, one highly rated vendor at a time. Time consuming but rewarding when you find the good one.<br /><br />-Mel

				Well, i knew any nickname i&#039;d chose would be able to trace back to me, so i just generated a random string.<br /><br />And the 1BTC max is coz i&#039;m worried my country isn&#039;t a viable one to ship to, and i&#039;d rather lose a small amount of money.

It&#039;s not your nickname that would expose you if someone was using such a method, it is your writing style. Choosing a ludicrously long random username has no effect on this. I chose random letters for my name too, but that was more just lazyness. I wasn&#039;t really interested in having an &quot;identity&quot; on the road, so when I chose my buyer name I just keyboard mashed. Kinda wish i hadn&#039;t now though, I&#039;ll just need to pick, or make, a really cool avatar to make up for it&nbsp; ;D

				Yeah that would be the obvious thing to do, lol. Nah I&#039;ll probably just make an avatar with something catchy in it, then if I ever become a really active member of this forum people will probably start calling me by whatever the catchy thing is. Probably won&#039;t matter though, for all the amount of posting I&#039;m likely to do here my name is unlikely to matter to anyone, and this way I share my forum name with my buyer name on the road.<br /><br />Anyway, decent hash for 1btc/g with worldwide shipping. My first advice would be search for someone from your own country. I don&#039;t know where you are, but if you search on the road and tick &quot;Domestic Only&quot; you will only get results from your country. This helps with 2 things, firstly it will lower your costs (only need to factor in &quot;worldwide shipping&quot; if you plan to order from the other end of the world) and secondly it means it isn&#039;t coming through customs. My plan here is to avoid bringing stuff through customs unless I need to, fortunately I live in the UK and it seems there is a decent amount of choice for buying domestic.<br /><br />Just search through. There are tons of weed listings and there&#039;s definitely some great deals in there. I snagged a sample gram of skunk from a new vendor for about £4 including shipping, which was fantastic value. If you spend the time looking you&#039;ll eventually find that perfect little listing. There&#039;s certainly plenty of hash listed for under 1btc/g (currently that&#039;s about £20 in my money).<br /><br />Good luck :)<br /><br />
