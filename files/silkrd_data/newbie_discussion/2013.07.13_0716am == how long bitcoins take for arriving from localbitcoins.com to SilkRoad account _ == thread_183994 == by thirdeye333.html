				I haven&#039;t used localbitcoins, but I know that in general it will take at least 6 blockchain confirmations (usually around 1-2 hours when things are speedy!).

				All bitcoin transactions, including localbitcoins.com ones, are logged on the blockchain and each transaction needs 6 confirmations before the coins show up at their destination account. Local bitcoins to SR should take no more than 3 hours as they usually get confirmed fairly quickly ;)

				As well as the website, the blockchain is a log of all bitcoin transactions. You can also have a wallet on blockchain.info. So yeah, if you send the coins from LB to SR, the transaction will be on the blockchain.<br /><br />You can search for your transaction on blockchain by putting the destination wallet into the search function on the right hand side of blockchain.info. You will see it under the &#039;Home, Most recently mined blocks in the bitcoin block chain&#039;. When you put in the destination address, you can see how many confirmations your transaction has had.<br /><br />I hope this answers your questions ;)

				Ive signed up for this forum in order to get involved on this exact topic.<br />Tonight i have transferred a few bitcoins from my Localbitcoins wallet to my SR wallet.<br />As yet they have not arrived!<br />This is alarming as its been over 6 hours so far!<br />I have checked Blockchain and can see the request has had 25 Confirmations thus far!!!<br />Should i be worried? as ive read in previous posts in this thread that it normally ONLY TAKES 6 Confirmations per transaction???!!!<br />I am very concerned right now. VERY concerned :(<br />I am desperately waiting on any response from, Localbitcoins, SR, and or Blockchain help desk.<br />Im really hoping that im over reacting to the situation, but with that kind of $$$ on the line, WHO WOULDNT???<br />Please feel free to post anything relevant , as im sweating here!<br /><br />I also will post UPDATES if anything changes.. (I really hope it does)<br /><br />Peace to y&#039;all

				You didn&#039;t actually send them directly to SR did you?<br /><br />You should always mix the coins up a bit through a tumbler or fogger or something before sending them directly to SR.
