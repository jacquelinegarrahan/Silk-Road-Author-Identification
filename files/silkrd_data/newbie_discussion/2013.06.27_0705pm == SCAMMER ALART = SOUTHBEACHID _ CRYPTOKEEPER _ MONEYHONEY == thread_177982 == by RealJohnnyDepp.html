				SOUTHBEACHID&#039;S VENDOR PAGE: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4027097ff0<br /><br />HE TAKES YOUR MP, AND DOESN&#039;T HAVE THE BALLS TO EVEN REPLY BACK. HAS SCAMMED OVER $1,000 AND COUNTING SO FAR, NO PLANS TO STOP EITHER AND I BELIEVE HE HAS 2 OTHER ACCOUNTS THAT HE JUST LISTED ON HIS VENDOR PAGE FOR MORE SCAMMING.<br /><br />SO BEWARE OF:<br /><br />SOUTHBEACHID<br />CRYPTOKEEPER<br />MONEYHONEY<br /><br />STEALS YOUR MONEYPAKS, READS YOUR MESSAGES AND DOESN&#039;T EVEN GIVE IT A THOUGHT OF REPLYING BACK. PRETTY SURE THE GUYS GOT A SMALL SET OF BALLS IN REAL LIFE. VERY SHALLOW TO THE SR COMMUNITY LIKE THIS AND STEALING FROM OTHERS!<br /><br />I LEARNED MY LESSON, NOW DON&#039;T GET SCAMMED BY HIM!

				Either he is in with them or just put those 2 names on his vendor page for more credibly to scam others.<br /><br />Trying to find that out now, tho...<br /><br />Scammed for almost $300, but I use the stuff I buy on the Road for Medical use...which really sucks.

				Hm I don&#039;t know, Southbeachid&#039;s page says he does business on SR with those two other vendors (which may or may not be true). I don&#039;t think it means necessarily they&#039;re all the same vendor.<br /><br />I did a MP transaction with MoneyHoney a week or so ago and it worked out great, he credited my BTC quickly, no issues.

				Finally manned up and replied back to me, this is what he wrote...<br /><br />SouthBeachID: <br /><br />What does it matter if we reply back to you?<br />Do you believe that we will give you an explanation for all this beyond the one you have imagined up? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				Though I&#039;ve probably posted this in 5+ threads.... BlueSkyTraders requires no bank accounts or personal information.. You just go in Bank of America and make a deposit. Minimum is $400 to start out but i&#039;m sure if you tried putting $300 they wouldn&#039;t ignore it (like they say they might).

				MoneyHoney&#039;s been helpful so far with me. Im having trouble with my moneypak but it&#039;s not their&nbsp; problem and I dont think its a scam. Overall my messages have been answered fairly quickly, and based on the feedback and what other people have said Im giving them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Id like to use BlueSkyTraders but BOA isnt everywhere and not convenient for me.

				MoneyHoney exchanged a $480 REloadit card for me last night. I had my BTC in a matter of hours. Nothing stopping him from going scam at any point, but as of now, he&#039;s legit.

Odd that every single other one of your posts is spam, and the only post where you formed a paragraph with more than 2 sentences, it is a vouch for some slimy fuck that others are claiming to get ripped off by. Give me a fucking break.
