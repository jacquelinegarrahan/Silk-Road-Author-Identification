				The latest batch I got from CS got some mixed reviews.&nbsp; People said it was good but didn&#039;t last long and some even said that it didn&#039;t do much for them.&nbsp; I have yet to try it myself but I was just wondering since his last batch got all A+ reviews from people.

				some MDMA.&nbsp; His previous batch was really good and got rave reviews from everyone.&nbsp; This latest one got a bunch of mixed reviews or people saying they had to take more than expected.&nbsp; There was someone else saying something about this in one of the other forums also (too bad I couldn&#039;t reply to it because I&#039;m not at 50 posts yet).&nbsp; I&#039;ll be trying it this upcoming weekend but I&#039;m a bit concerned with all of these reviews I&#039;ve been getting back from people.
