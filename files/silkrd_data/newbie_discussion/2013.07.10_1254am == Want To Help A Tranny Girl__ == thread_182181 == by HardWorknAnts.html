				&nbsp;I donate only to a specific charity that has demonstrated its ability to reallocate funds responsibly. You can get intouch with them if you want some of my hard earned cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also, if youre making a killing in the streets, please take the time to find a trustworthy charity and pay your dues. If you dont pay taxes, you still have dues to society... and if you disagree, thats cool.... but Ill fucking cut your legs off if we get to know eachother.

				Aww this is touching, but realistically I dont think this is the avenue for such a request unless you are planning on buying your hormone treatments from the Road, but I probably wouldnt trust that.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would suggest starting a blog chronicalizing the changes and effects its having on your body.&nbsp; Hell with the way things are setup you maybe able to create a compelling youtube video and get the company to sponsor you treatment for a year while you document it on your blog.&nbsp; Closed mouths don&#039;t get fed.&nbsp; So I commend you for being bold enough to state your wants.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be discouraged, and I wish you much success.

				Why don&#039;t you donate something and I&#039;ll use my language and writing skills to write something about it. Frankly don&#039;t care to share more of my life than this without seeing something for it. Call me pretentious, a whore, or just desperate... I still have needs.<br /><br /><br />All I will say is that like substances/medications/drugs/thoughts, hormones adjust nearly every system of the body to change its state, including your neurochemical balance.<br /><br />Every 7 years your body replaces every cell in it... With a new hormonal balance for &gt;14 years, Can you imagine what reverting it into another state, dramatically, and without remorse, can do to a body and mind?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182181.msg1337590#msg1337590">Quote from: Robobot on July 14, 2013, 06:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">seriously curious, what happens if you stop your medication?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Does this insinuate that my original/posts are Trollism?<br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to take compliments when they are anonymous and ambiguous.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t wring MEN out for blah blah blah, if you notice, I only &quot;got mad at/flamed&quot; sour grapes for a gender role. You sir, I called out with your non gender specific thought.<br /><br />Noble intentions for a place that has seemingly a gathering of both intelligence and idiots in true senses of the terms...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182181.msg1336683#msg1336683">Quote from: HenryC0833 on July 14, 2013, 01:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. whatever. <br />2. not really.&nbsp; Ambiguity and anonymity are two different things.&nbsp; Are you one of those people who can&#039;t take a compliment?&nbsp; <br />3. yep<br />4. you&#039;re like every other woman in the world, you do everything you can to wring out of men the thing that you like best about them.&nbsp; I could be wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fair warning, m&#039;lady, I don&#039;t believe in randomness; my hobby here is taking troll posts and turning them into meaningful discussions of real things.&nbsp; There is always something real there, lurking right under the surface. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				1.&nbsp; Um, yeah?<br />2.&nbsp; So the comment is a word play on ambiguity, a term which can be used in two ways in this thread.&nbsp; The first context is where men seem very interested in you, and yet hide behind ambiguity, or in other words instead of saying &quot;hey you sound really cool and stimulating&quot; there&#039;s all this &quot;oh I wanna see a pic cuz.... cuz... cuz I think you&#039;re a fibber!&quot;&nbsp; Ambiguity has its role here, it allows people to express themselves (to a point) without getting outside their comfort zone.&nbsp; Shows a certain lack of courage in my mind, but whatever.&nbsp; The other angle on ambiguity here is the gender ambiguity.&nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of people in this world deal with gender ambiguity, on a number of physical, neurological and psychological levels, and they suffer because of it.&nbsp; I like it that you you&#039;ve taken a stand against ambiguity.&nbsp; &quot;This is who I am.&quot;&nbsp; Speaking of courage, I think that shows a great deal of courage.&nbsp; So the joke is, the people who are giving you a bunch of grief are showing a lack of courage, and you&#039;re showing unusual courage.&nbsp; There&#039;s the compliment.<br />3.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure where you&#039;re going with this, but feel like I&#039;ve been put in my place.<br />4. Yep.
