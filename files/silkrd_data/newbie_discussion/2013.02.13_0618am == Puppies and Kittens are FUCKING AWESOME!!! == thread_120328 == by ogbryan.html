				I feel like your talkin about drugs or sex and im talkin about pets... lol<br /><br />I have 2 puppies.&nbsp; A great dane, she is 3, was the runt of the litter so she is small for her breed, but standing on her back paws she is taller than I am.&nbsp; The other puppy is a siberian husky mixed with touch of lab..&nbsp; I had lots of kitties growing up, but no doggies.&nbsp; Then family situations changed, and somewhere along the line I developed an allergy to the kitties when I was about 19.&nbsp; I rehomed a couple of them, but kept one despite the allergy until she went off to die :(&nbsp; She was old.&nbsp; I defintely like big dogs, but don&#039;t really have a preference on cats.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would LOVE to have one of these...&nbsp; &nbsp;they have been genetically altered to be hypoallergenic...&nbsp; but geez, maybe when I win the lottery....<br />hmm...&nbsp; &nbsp;idk, can I post off topic and outside links on here?<br /><br />Anyways, its a company called allerca, or you can google &quot;lifestyle pets&quot;, One of their cats is a domesticated mini leopard, 25 pounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;But they also costs as much as a car!!

				Awwwww, nice Thread&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :D<br /><br />I living with cats for 25 years now.<br />One i rescued from being killed (too many kittens born on a farm) and i was devastated, when she died 2008 - she was almost 20 then.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120328.msg820378#msg820378">Quote from: kittiesandpuppies on February 13, 2013, 06:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Im allergic to kitties and i think the dog would eat the cat.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i&#039;m a tad allergic to cats too, but that hasn&#039;t kept me from living with them *snivel*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Atm, we have a dog and a cat. The cat was housebroken by our former dog (a huge great dane) and afterwards he protected the cat from intruders and the cat brought him Mice to eat ... crazy.<br />We worried a little what will happen with our new dog - got him 2009 - but the cat made quite clear, who the &quot;Alpha&quot; is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;D
