				Hello to all my fellow brothers and sisters! Well, to make a long story short, I suppose that I was one of the few lucky ones when this whole bitcoin/Mt. Gox/instawallet things went down recently. I had a bit of surplus in the account and could still continue fun times on SR. Does anyone have insight on how to move forward, it is obviously important to run your coin through a couple of avenues before that transfer and I am just looking for some insight and advice. It would be much appreciated! My funds are now running a bit low and it is time to put some more BTC in the account. What do you all use nowadays in light of the changes? What works best? I am not concerned about a time frame, I rather keep the anonymity aspect current and viable.

				Thank you for the info and replies everyone! I did finally get a bit more coin today and used the easywallet suggested. This past week or so has been quite a trip hasn&#039;t it? I am glad that we are back up and running! You guys are awesome!

				Easywallet is a nice alternative to Instawallet, but it&#039;s not free.

				Easywallet - not free, but somehow that puts me more at ease than someone charging me nothing to store my money. That said, it&#039;s like 0.0005 btc per day or something like that. It&#039;s a very small number. And even if you&#039;re keeping large sums in there they only charge about 1% monthly. Pretty good setup, the next best thing we have currently.

				Agreed. :) Here&#039;s hoping some of the fees go toward securing their servers.

				And why not keeping it on an encrypted USB key?<br /><br />That way you keep the power over your BTC...
