				i&#039;ve ordered from a couple wax vendors on here and i&#039;ve gotta say...&nbsp; none of these concentrates should cost more than 40/g, imo, and that is including the price of convenience.&nbsp; it really bums me out to see some ppl charging like 70 a gram plus shipping, idgaf if you say it&#039;s CO2 or winterized or w/e the fuck else ppl think rationalizes paying that much, 80 percent of the wax i see in pictures here looks like SHIT..&nbsp; <br /><br />so i guess my question is, how many of yall are actually paying these prices??&nbsp; tbh i have before because i really don&#039;t like smoking weed and if i&#039;ve got no way to make my own BHO then i&#039;m willing to pay up to get some decent medicine.. but not everyone can afford to do that and when in reality a gram of amazing errl doesn&#039;t cost more than 30 bucks in green states, i just feel like vendors are abusing the fact that most of the kids on here don&#039;t know jack shit about concentrates to sucker them out of their btc.&nbsp; it reminds me of the dudes who&#039;d walk around my projects when i was like 13 or so selling border shake to all us dumbass kids and calling it &quot;green apple kush&quot; or w/e.<br /><br />i just wanted to post this up so maybe someone reads it before dropping 60 dollars on some 2nd run reject gloop.&nbsp; educate yourself just a little bit and it&#039;s easy to see thru so much of the bullshit these ppl try to feed us, like that shatter is better than wax or that they&#039;re running all nug material (here&#039;s a secret: nobody trying to turn a profit fucking does that, if u want all nug then u gotta run ur own pal).&nbsp; if i&#039;m just being a cynical ass and someone here can show me that they really are making some serious concentrate, i&#039;d love to be corrected, but as far as i can tell right now there are only a handful of vendors who i see selling legit mind-expanding, body-melting, oil-napping shit, and they&#039;re almost all charging an arm and a leg..&nbsp; &nbsp;anyways what are yalls thoughts??&nbsp; would it be beneficial to hack together some kind of BHO FAQ or something so ppl are all laced up on the situation and don&#039;t get fucked over (i heard someone got sent a straight up 1/4 obama of RECLAIM once here)?&nbsp; <br /><br />just thinking out loud, there&#039;s a lot of problems with SR that we can&#039;t fix, but there are certainly things we all can do to improve/simplify the process (just check the LSD avengers thread for concrete proof of that).&nbsp; would someone like to slap something together or post up links to some stuff they think is helpful??&nbsp; i&#039;d do it if i cared that much about it but tbh just starting this thread depleted about all the energy i&#039;m willing to devote to keeping other ppl from getting fucked over.&nbsp; l8r

				i pay 40 a gram when i buy ounces and it gets shipped from dispensaries in Colorado. I usually ask for butter not wax. Much smoother and cleaner. don&#039;t make you&#039;re own bho trust me dispensary oil is 10x better. I might make a listing for it soon.
