				I&#039;m finally getting that an error was accounted as opposed to not being able to connect to anything?<br /><br />Is either one better news?

				Also, the forums have been really quick. The initial dos target SR and the forums. So unless it is only targeting the site now I&#039;m led to believe that this is DPR doing his thing and patching things up. I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m talking about but that sounds logical?

Hopefully it&#039;ll be back up later tonight, I&#039;d rather have a slow road then no road at all.

				I think it means that things are progressing and that DPR and his team are working very hard to get things back up and running.&nbsp; :)

				I just got back on, I had to reboot comp and then log in with Tor and change my identity like 3 times, but so far so good, I have to get some listings up before I&#039;m booted again. Whoever is up to this attacking crap really needs to get a new hobby, shits getting old.
