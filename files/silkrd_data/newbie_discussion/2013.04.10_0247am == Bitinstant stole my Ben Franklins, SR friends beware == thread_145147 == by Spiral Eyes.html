				&nbsp; Ok my fellow roaders, it&#039;s official . These scum bags have taken my money and do not intend to make good on the deposit I made, and I have proof that I made it. Some of you may have seen my other threads, asking for advice and what have you. It&#039;s been almost 2 weeks since I made a money gram deposit to bitinstant. They confirmed they got my money, and gave me an INVALID Mt gox code. In the last 2 weeks, they have ignored me, passed me off to various agents, supposedly sent 2 of my emails directly to CHARLIE the CEO, but mostly just aggressively refused to make good on the several hundred dollar deposit I made to them through moneygram.&nbsp; Its been about 4-5 days since they&#039;ve responded to me. So last night I sent an email stating that if I didn&#039;t get my money or resolution by tonight, I&#039;d have no choice but to consider my money stolen by them, and that I have a large audience ( you all ) that will hear the details of my misfortune . An audience that has other options&nbsp; for making their deposits. I have received no reply from said fuckwads. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So, my friends , I hereby warn you. Bitinstant has stolen my fucking money. Flat out taken my my money and not given me anything for it. Several emails have resulted in not one apology for mishandling my hard earned hundreds, not one assurance that I will get my money back, not one iota of anything resembling customer service. I&#039;m telling you folks, in all that I have seen from these fuck wads in the last 2 weeks, it feels very much like getting mugged. Apparently I have no recourse, no action I can take to hold them accountable. No better business bureau or the like. This fucking sucks people. All I can do is warn you all, and ask you to find yourself a better option. They have my hundreds, but they don&#039;t have to have yours. Sure, I made a few transactions with these assholes that went well. But not worth the hundreds they stole. And you may get lucky too. But if someone stole money from my friends, I would never do business with them again. Not if I had options. You&#039;ve been warned.

				Of course. Both Gox and Bitinstant have confirmed that they gave me a code that doesn&#039;t work. Regardless, bitinstant support has done nothing to help me resolve it. It took five days just to get a response from their &quot;LIVE &quot; support crew. It&#039;s been 2 weeks dude. They don&#039;t respond to emails or phone calls. It would seriously take them 5 minutes to fix this if they wanted to. My frustrations stems from there complete lack of any effort to assure me I will get my deposit. The deposit confirmation they gave me stated that my funds were deposited DIRECTLY into my gox account, and that a code was not needed. Then both gox and bitinstant said they issued me a code. Well, the code doesnt work.. and that my friends is as far as I&#039;ve gotten before they stopped responding to me. <br />&nbsp; I did a transaction 4 days before that , same method, same email about direct deposit to gox, and it was in fact a direct deposit to gox. So, it seems that all bitinstant would need to do it deposit my fucking money to gox like they were supposed to. But instead, they kept my money and wont respond to my requests for support. It bullshit.

				I had the same thing happen to me only i was making a deposit that was to be routed to Bitstamp. I found my way to this link and found resolution in about 4 days.<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.4320&nbsp; . I asked URSAY (a Bitinstant rep on there) to #1. create me a ticket and #2 escalate my issue as i had been waiting far too long. Although you are pissed off and have a right to be it won&#039;t help you to threaten them. If they won&#039;t help you then you take action. Look through that thread and you will see countless people got resolution. Please make no mistake...i do not trust these fuckers and it will be a cold day in hell before i use them again but i got my money back.

				I was calm and polite for about 8 days, but after being ignored and having exactly zero people assure me I would be getting my money, I felt I had to be THAT GUY and start raising my voice. I mean, how was I supposed to know that I was one of hundreds of people who didn&#039;t get their money. All someone had to do was tell me yes, we are sorry for the fuck up, you will receive your money. Believe me, I&#039;m not a guy who runs around screaming at people when something goes wrong. I exhausted all my pleasantries with these dick heads before making threats. THEY WERE NOT RESPONDING TO MY REQUESTS FOR RESOLUTION. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, thanks again for the help. I&#039;m glad to hear that some people have been able to get their money back. I&#039;m not so hopeful, but I&#039;ll try.

				Yeah, BitInstant has dropped the ball twice with me...<br /><br />Considering I&#039;ve been using them for a long time now, and for countless transactions I would say two minor fuck ups here and there is not bad at all. In fact, considering the volume of orders they must get on a daily basis and the relatively limited amount of staff, I would actually say they do a damn good job.<br /><br />In both instances, the snag-up was cleared up within 3-4 days after I contacted BitInstant by email.... <br /><br />It&#039;s incredibly easy to get impatient and want to start making demands with them, but try not to... That&#039;s not going to help and in reality will probably only delay your funds further. Try to keep in mind the number of orders they have coming in everyday, occasional mistakes will happen as they are only human. I was fucking PISSED when my funds got snagged up with BitInstant- the one time it was for just under $500 and a good 3 or 4 day delay, which frustrated me cause I had set my weekend plans up based on the expected Friday arrival of a package I was looking to purchase, but by the time the error was fixed and I got my order placed, it was a whole week later by the time I finally received my product. But I held my tongue, was very polite and kind, and they took care of it for me no problem.<br /><br />Rachel was the girl who helped me, I don&#039;t know if you can request a certain customer support rep, but if a few days passes and you still haven&#039;t had any luck, ask to have the ticket/claim forwarded to Rachel- she was extremely prompt, polite and very understanding and worked hard to get my issue straightened out.<br /><br />I can assure you BitInstant is not going around selectively scamming people... they have a legitimate business, and considering the amount of BTC in circulation and the sudden market boom, they&#039;re making plenty of cash... no need to rob people.<br /><br />Best of luck

				A simple or even not so simple mistake i could understand. We&#039;re all human and i am a reasonable person. What i do not understand and was the deciding factor for me to never use Bitinstant again is that on April 2nd i made my deposit and it took 4-5 days to go through because of all the issues going on. Well here we are on April 10th and peoples orders are still getting screwed up and they are still taking business and effectively stealing from people 100% knowingly. By the time i got to buy my coins when the funds hit the exchange the price went up 25% and who ate that......me. That is bad business and ultimately clinched it for me. Fuck Bitinstant i will never use them again.

				I awoke this morning to find that BI has finally processed my funds . I&#039;m a little disappointed that I was still charged BI fees and that I know have to pay $100 per btc rather than the $85 it was if my deposit had been processed correctly. Oh well, I&#039;m happy to finally have my money. <br />&nbsp; To anyone with bitinstant trouble, follow this thread:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.5400<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank you to the SR forum member who pointed me to it. Not sure if I&#039;d have gotten my money back without you. New deposits with BI appear to currently have about a %25 chance of failure, according to their support rep.
