				I am in a pickle here... I am new to the scene and need assistance in figuring out how to ship. I know all the inns and outs of being able to package. I just need help figuring out how to &quot;ship&quot; it discreetly.&nbsp; I have searched far and wide as to not come off as a dumb ass but this has really stumped me. Does anyone have any ideas? or can assist me? I can compensate you for your knowledge in some form :)<br /><br />Pllllleaaase?!?!&nbsp;

				The Shipping forum will probably tell you everything you need to know: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=6.0<br />And the wiki has some advice: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br /><br />Those 4 stickies on the shipping forum should give you a good idea on how to package stuff. However Im no vendor and cant help you much more than that. I believe the vendors have a private forum too, so if you have a vendor account (and you have to in order to sell stuff here :)) you might try asking there.<br /><br />Good luck!

All businesses have start-up costs and, no offense, but if you cannot afford the $500 start up bond you really shouldn&#039;t be selling here. Just think of it as an opportunity cost, for a $500 down payment you have access to a huge client base to sell to, potentially earning you 10s of thousands of dollars.
