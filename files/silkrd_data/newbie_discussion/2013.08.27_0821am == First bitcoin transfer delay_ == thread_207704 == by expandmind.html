				I just transferred my FIRST batch of bitcoin to my SR wallet from coinbase. The transfer completed on coinbase over an hour ago. As long as I sent it to the address on my SR account page, there is nothing to worry about right?

				most often takes an hour to 1.5 hours for SR to receive the appropriate number of confirmations of the transfer from blockchain. This is completely normal. I&#039;ve never had my funds take LESS than an hour to appear in my account.

I am sure there have been long delays like this in the past, there was just a maintenance on the SR the other day I saw while trying to browse it would not let me because of maintenance, maybe that is why. I hope this goes through soon enough to get my order by the time I wanted it :/

				I did the transfer to my account too, and it&#039;s more than 6 hours passed with no avail. I had no trust in sending side either, so it was a bit more unpleasant for me, and it keeps bugging me still. I know that everything is probably okay, but I&#039;m still anxious.

				Well, wait some more, I guess. I just hope our BTCs were not lost or else.
