				This shit is so confusing.<br />I&#039;ve double-checked and I did everything right, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Deposited $$$ at CVS over an hour ago and BitInstant says &quot;Order executed - funds deposited at remote exchange&quot;, but I don&#039;t see anything happening, pending, etc on my BitStamp account.<br />Hopefully I&#039;m impatient and not a fuckup.<br /><br /><br />Any helpful tips or thoughts?<br />Also, hello.&nbsp; ;D There&#039;s some good reading on this forum. It does smell a bit strange around here though...

				haha maybe&nbsp; you should take your monthly shower then... jk man, welcome.&nbsp; Also I&#039;m about to do a bitinstant -&gt; bitstamp -&gt; SR order for half the funds I want on SR and the other half will be a ziggap -&gt; chase bank -&gt; bitfog/tumble -&gt; SR to see how fast and reliable these methods are.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait any longer for bitinstant -&gt; btc address service to come back up.&nbsp; It&#039;s been down for about a week, then they said it would be up Monday night, now they are saying Friday night and I have a feeling it could be much longer if it ever comes back.&nbsp; Seems like they are dragging the shit out instead of coming out and just saying welp its gone guys.&nbsp; I may eat my words though.&nbsp; Bitinstant to BTC address was the best by far though.

				My email from BitInstant does have one goofy part.<br /><br />APIResponse: {&quot;error&quot;: {&quot;amount&quot;: [&quot;You have only $85.08 available. Check your account balance for details.&quot;]}}<br />FundsSent: $96.01 USD<br /><br />Errors are not usually a good thing. I have no clue wtf it means though.<br />I&#039;ve given up on immediacy and as long as I haven&#039;t lost the money, I will be happy.<br />I am looking forward to some of that xany powder though.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; :-\

				hmmm funny they would echo the api json response in an email.&nbsp; Looks like whatever service they were connecting to via API didn&#039;t have enough funds for your transaction and really should have failed.&nbsp; Very interesting indeed!

				I guess I will just have to wait until they reply to my email or use their site&#039;s LIVE CHAT when BitInstant&#039;s workday has started.<br />Now I&#039;m gonna have to do rush shipping for my weekend fun times. Well... I don&#039;t NEED to... :P

				I&#039;m worried to use bitinstant at the moment and having my money tied up.&nbsp; The have been down for what what seems to be a week and the owner isn&#039;t around much on the clearnet forums he usually posts in.&nbsp; I just made a cash deposit through chase bank with ziggap.com and we will see how that goes.

				Still waiting... definitely not instant.<br /><br />Apparently BitInstant is low on funds and will transfer once they get more.<br /><br />what<br />the<br />fuck<br /><br />Oh well. Now I (we) wait. Honestly, this was what I expected.<br />dangit

				I have nothing positive to say about bitinstant. it &#039;s a terrible service where your money could be locked up for weeks due to any one of 6 different processing companies each order goes through, or if the owner forgot to pay his bills (which has been happening for the last 3 weeks). Avoid like an STD, imo.

				I haven&#039;t tried any other service than bitinstant. i have a good stash of coins from mining in 2011, and i only used bitinstant once because mtgox was getting slammed by ddos.
