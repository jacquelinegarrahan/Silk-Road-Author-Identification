It was tried before but the company that offered it were targeted by people who were using stolen credit card details and after they&#039;d sent out the Bitcoin, the banks got on to them and reversed the credit card transactions leaving the Bitcoin seller with no money and no Bitcoin!<br /><br />If I recall correctly there IS a site that will allow you to buy very minute amounts (I&#039;m talking 0.01 BTC amounts) using a credit card, but they require &quot;CIA Top Secret&quot; style identity verification so it really wouldn&#039;t be worth it!<br /><br />Libertas

				That makes sense I didn&#039;t think about it like that,&nbsp; i&#039;m just trying to figure out how to buy like ten btc without giving away any personal info, and without having to do more than one deposit with ridiculous fees.&nbsp; Maybe have a trusted unconnected friend buy the coin through coinbase or something and then send it to my wallet?&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				If you live in a densely populated area you could probably use LocalBitcoins.com fairly anonymously.&nbsp; &nbsp;Alternately you could try selling that prepaid visa card on Bitmit.net.
