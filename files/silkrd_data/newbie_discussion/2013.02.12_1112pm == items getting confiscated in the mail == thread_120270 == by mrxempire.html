				about one and a half months ago, I ordered a 10 dollar, 120 mg MDMA pill from schizofreen, The package never arrived, so i can only assume it was confiscated by customs or U.S post office or something like that. Since it was only a small pill, i figure they probably didn&#039;t care very much where it was from, or where it was going. However, hypothetically, lets say I order a bigger package, lets say 25 gram MDMA package from germany, and use my real address as the delivery location (pgp encrypted when I order of course). If this package gets confiscated, will customs, USPS, or LE be more concerned about the contents of this package, seeing as it&#039;s a bulk shipment, and come knocking at my door? from what i&#039;ve learned about SR so far, there have only been a couple of recorded arrests of customers ordering bulk, and that no matter what you order, even if it is a large amount, if it is confiscated, it will just never arrive at your door, and that will be the end of the story. Could someone please give me some pointers on this situation?&nbsp; Hypothetically this is my first bulk order, so hypothetically I am a little nervous.

				You say the package never arrived.&nbsp; Did you talk with the vendor and try to clear it up?&nbsp; It&#039;s possible it legitimately got lost in the mail I suppose.&nbsp; If you are going to have this second order sent to the same address as the one that &quot;disappeared,&quot; that seems pretty sketchy to me.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know man, every purchase I&#039;ve made here has gone smoothly and I still get kind of nervous.&nbsp; I think if I were in your shoes I&#039;d try to forget that SR even exists, but that&#039;s just me.

				the first order was just one pill from the netherlands. The netherlands is a known hot spot for drugs, so I can understand that something being ordered from there would be confiscated. I&#039;ve made about 10 transactions on SR so far, all of them small items, and all of them have arrived safely, except for this one pill, so i&#039;m assuming i&#039;m not on any Law enforcements &quot;most wanted drug kingpins&quot; list right now. I feel like this one failed order shouldn&#039;t cause me to panic and do drastic things like change the address im shipping to, but since this is my first semi-large order, I&#039;m hoping to consult with others who have experience with this matter.

				P.S regarding the MDMA pill, schizofreen was kind enough to give me a full refund on what I ordered. I&#039;d reccomend them, but I don&#039;t think they ship to U.S anymore
