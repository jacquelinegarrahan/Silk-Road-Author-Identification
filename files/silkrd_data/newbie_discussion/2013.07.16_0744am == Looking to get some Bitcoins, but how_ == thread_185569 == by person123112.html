				I am new to this whole system and have been trying to get some bitcoins. What would be the best way to do this anonymously without using localbitcoin services? The rates are way too high on there for me. I&#039;m looking to convert cash into bitcoins using some sort of system like a moneypak, etc. I fear using Mt.Gox because they ask for so much information, or does this really matter? Is there a safe method of using Gox?

				Still looking for any information or answers. I want to find a reliable service that I can use weekly. Something that is anonymous, or can be made to be anonymous. Please help, it&#039;s been one hell of a pain in the ass so far to try and get some bitcoins.

				&nbsp;I use bitcoin brokers.. basically what you do is go to their website http://www.bitcoin-brokers.org/ and click on their helpdesk tab and submit a ticket saying you want certain amount of bitcoins within a bank of your choice ( check out his website for different types of banks available). then he will give you a deposite instructions (basically paying cash to the teller) and then you have to send him picture of the reciept and the tellers business card. you will then recieve your coins within couple of hours, mine took almost 4 hours to get my coins into my wallet. his rates are reasonable too.
