				so I got a letter yesterday from the only order I was expecting, except it showed up with the top of it stapled shut and nothing inside. Does this mean customs went through it?

				We don&#039;t think they that if customs opened the package they would send it empty.<br />From what I know they are sending letters that you should come and claim what was in the package and recover it.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT

				They would include a letter if they confiscated the contents. There are two options, either a rogue customs or mail employee took the item, knowing you wouldn&#039;t complain about it because it&#039;s illegal, or the vendor sent you an empty package, either by accident or because they are trying to scam you. Some vendor recently did that. I&#039;d check the forum to see if there are other reports of that happening with your vendor.<br />

				Agree with HurtsOnHeroin. Make sure you do your research on the forums before making any purchases, You can&#039;t always rely on road feedback alone.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, what was it you ordered?

				Sorry about that,you might have got vendor scammed or robbed by a greedy postman,<br /><br />Don&#039;t think customs would cut open and send it back stapled,<br /><br />Talk to your vendor about it, hes the closest to helping you out

				What was supposed to be in the envelope?&nbsp; If a greedy postal worker were to have stolen the contents, what would indicate the postman to open that particular envelope?

				this is hardly a postal worker. they can&#039;t open shit without a warrant unless they really hate their job which is highly unlikely.<br />this sounds to me like this seller scammed you and you need to take this up with the Resolution center

				yeah, sounds like vendor was a bit too clever by half.&nbsp; figured you would think exactly what you thought - that postal worker must have opened it.&nbsp; i&#039;d play his own game with him and complain that stealth was obviously inadequate and demand a reship.&nbsp; See what he has to say about that.
