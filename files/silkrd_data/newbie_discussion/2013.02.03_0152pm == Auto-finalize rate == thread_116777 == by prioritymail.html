				Hi guys,<br /><br />So I joined SR about 5 months ago and I&#039;ve only had 3 transactions. Out of the 3, I stupidly auto-finalized one because I was away on vaca and just totally forgot about the transaction. I know this is totally my fault but I was wondering if I should just create a new account and start fresh? or just keep using my account. <br /><br />I just made 2 purchases and I messaged both vendors trying to explain my auto-finalize rate and acknowledged that it was my fault and would not happen again. <br /><br />I don&#039;t make big orders most of the time but down the line, I might start buying more expensive stuff. <br /><br />What do you guys think I should do? Thanks.

				Your gonna have to message vendors explaining when you purchase until the stat goes down.

				Thanks for the reply. <br /><br />Okay, I don&#039;t mind having to send vendors a message each time but you think setting up a new account would be a bad idea?

				Well if you look at SR as being like a video game, this is like dying on level 1. The games not over, but you might as well start over because it won&#039;t really set you back too far and you may need that extra life later.<br /><br />If you see SR as more like a puppy, then making a new account is akin to having it put to sleep because it pooped in your bedroom once. <br /><br />When I have instances where I&#039;ll be away when my package arrives, I have just gone ahead and finalized. It wasn&#039;t even because I was worried about AF, but because I did not think it was right to keep the seller waiting for payment because I chose to be unavailable when I was expecting a package to arrive. If the package did not arrive or there was some problem with the product and after contacting the seller made it obvious I had been burned and I was SOL because I had already finalized, I&#039;d give 1/5 feedback and explain what happened in the review. This is exactly why if you ever do FE, you should not submit 5/5 feedback stating that you finalized early, but wait until you have received and tried the product and then post the review. That way it shows up at the top of the seller&#039;s feedback and not three pages back where your &quot;FE Will update&quot; will be if anyone ever bothered to update. I see a 3 month old &#039;FE will update&quot; and realize why these people were asked to FE in the first place. <br /><br />In a nutshell, it&#039;s better to FE than to AF and if you do FE it does not stand for &quot;Feedback Early&quot;.<br /><br />As for whether or not to start a new account, I think Marlo said it best, &quot;Eeither do it or don&#039;t, but I got some place to be&quot;<br /><br />
