				&nbsp;DO NOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY YOU ARE FROM.<br /><br />Anyone can come onto the forums and see this.&nbsp; Its hard enough getting shit into Oz as it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;Customs read this as well so by saying where you are from will only make life hard.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have in the vendor comments go back and edit the word AUSTRALIA out.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				hey oz everything will be just fine.&nbsp; The first time is always incredibly stressful.&nbsp; I was so afraid i was getting scammed my very first online drug purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;Really you&#039;ve got it good.&nbsp; When i started doing this silk road wasn&#039;t around yet and you would just send your cash to a complete stranger and hope your product would arrive.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have things like escrow, marked transit, tracking numbers.&nbsp; You just sent off your money and prayed lol.&nbsp; At that time to it would take almost three weeks for an international order to arrive.&nbsp; Just remember your safe and protected as long as you didn&#039;t FE.&nbsp; Sometimes it can take a day or two for a vendor to respond to a message.&nbsp; Remember he is not a local dealer who handles 5-6 deals a day.&nbsp; He&#039;s processing orders in vast amounts reading/answering emails, packing and sending packages (which can sometimes mean driving around to several drop boxes and can take a few hours) plus still deal with their own daily lives.&nbsp; This is a pretty demanding job and remember they don&#039;t notifications on their smart phones when they receive a new message.&nbsp; So in the future i recommend sending one message and waiting a few days for a response before sending another one.&nbsp; Just be patient and breathe and enjoy the silk road :)&nbsp; Hope i could help.
