				Hello everyone. I&#039;m still pretty new to Tor and anonymous internet usage and I have some questions I&#039;d like to clear up before delving deeper into this convoluted world. I was wondering if anyone could point me to the best newer user guides first, so I can read up before asking any dumb questions that will upset current forum members. Also, I&#039;d like a list of activities to refrain from while using Tor/Silk Road, as I know you should disable Javascript, but thats all the precautions I really know how to take. Is it possible to use P2P software while connected to Tor, and/or will the speeds be very slow? Also, should I only use the Tor browser while connected, not a regular web browser. Thanks for your help guys.

				If you download the TOR bundle, I&#039;m pretty sure the javascript is already disabled in the TOR browser. One thing you should avoid when using TOR is to open a PDF document on your browser, or to stream for a video. A website would be able to know you are using TOR to access it, so you might want to use a proxy (startpage) to access a website if you&#039;re worried. Always use TOR browser for any SR activities.<br />

				Yes. But just in case, I never browse anything that reveals my identity on this computer.

				In most cases the tor browser bundle will suffice, but using TAILS (even inside a VM) is safer because it totally keeps your darknet browsing/activity separate, and even if you screw up and leave history or books,arks penabled, TAILS resets to defaults on every reboot.

				(Just thought of this, too:) ...and TAILS has PGP tools built-in, too, which can be handy (and is not included in the TBB). Just make sure if you create your own private key that you save it s,we here (but *most* buyers probably,wouldn&#039;t need their own keys for any reason)

				If you are using TOR with FireFox,&nbsp; the &quot;NoScript&quot; add on is a must ... it disables java script, except for sites you can choose to allow &#039;temporary permission&#039; or put on the &#039;whitelist&#039; for those sites you trust completely ... in fact, with Firefox-tor there&#039;s also two other addons called&nbsp; &quot; Cookie Monster&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;Ghostery&quot; which blaocks tracking sites.&nbsp; &nbsp;VERY Worth using imho<br /><br />It&#039;s been the best &#039;frontline&#039; defense, and deals with all forms of &#039;malicious scripting&#039; .... I&#039;m not very knowledgable about computers, but I&#039;ve run &#039;No Script&#039; for a few years now and&nbsp; never been infected by anything! I also run Antimalware Bytes, but No Script is a powerful tool&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Ther&#039;s just SO MUCH TO KNOW!!! Aaarrrgghh!&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />I think I will be progressing to Linux sooner than later, which is a bit daunting!&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone know any &#039;easy&#039;&nbsp; linux tutorials?&nbsp; ???&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><br /><br />welcome and good luck with your travels on the road.&nbsp; Check out the &quot;Phishing&quot; section and MAKE SURE you are using the correct URL ...for TSR it&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/&quot;&nbsp; BEWARE of ANY OTHER extra letters like &quot; .to &quot; added, you are being phished IF they are there ... check out the &#039;Security Section&#039; of the forum.<br /><br />Oh and besides NEVER FEing,&nbsp; LEARN PGP, asap,&nbsp; &nbsp;and great first post amigo, here&#039;s your first +1, keep up the interesting and informative posting (and/or go to a spam thread just to get your post count to 50 ..you can then post in ALL the forums&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; The 50 post things is to keep away bots and trolling fuckwits&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Take it easy ABF <br /><br />m m m motek&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;m curious: what&#039;s the benefit/reason to use Tor with Firefox instead of just the Tor Browser Bundle? It seems the latter is both easier *and* safer because its all pre-configured.

				Welcome<br /><br />What kind of P2P software are you talking about?&nbsp; It could, perhaps, be used with more or less anonymity.&nbsp; I suppose that depends on how you are P2P&#039;ing. <br /><br />The Tor website, which you may have noticed, declares also to not open any file downloaded while still on Tor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Be careful<br /><br />Motek - I don&#039;t have any linux tutorial links laying around at the moment, but I want to encourage you with linux!&nbsp; I say pick one and dive in with it!&nbsp; If you need to do any power user moves, just research the technique on the &#039;net.&nbsp; You may want to check out distrowatch.org and read up on some OS jive.&nbsp; There is a good amount of information there.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if you are aware, but you can have more than one OS on a hard drive.&nbsp; You can also burn a live disc of many of their operating systems so as to perform an even more lightweight test drive.&nbsp; You can also even play with virtual machines and not have to burn a disc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, installing an OS is pretty much going to be extremely easy.&nbsp; Once you have it installed, especially if it is a popular &#039;easy to get along with&#039; linux, you will realize that you are in an environment which is easy to navigate and thereby easy to learn the ropes.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say it enough - literally, just hop on in!
