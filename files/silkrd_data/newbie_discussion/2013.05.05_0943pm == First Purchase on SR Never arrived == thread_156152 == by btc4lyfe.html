				I ordered a small amount of MDMA on the 21st.&nbsp; The item was marked &quot;in transit&quot; on the 23rd.&nbsp; But It never showed up.&nbsp; I triple checked my shipping address, used the correct info, but still my package never showed up.&nbsp; Does this mean that my name and address has now been flagged and that I can&#039;t ever receive packages again without having them confiscated?&nbsp; The only thing that I can possibly think went wrong is that I didn&#039;t use GPG because I had no idea how to use it at the time.

				Yes, communication was good, here are the messages that we exchanged:<br /><br />me: I&#039;m wondering if you shipped my order priority or first class, because I believe you marked it as &quot;in transit&quot; on Monday, but still haven&#039;t received it and I&#039;m getting a little worried :/<br /><br />vendor(99): It shipped out priority on the 23rd it looks like.<br />Sometimes I miss the collection times so just add a day.<br />If nothing shows by Monday then we have a problem.<br /><br />me: It&#039;s been a little over a week now, so I would think that at this point, there&#039;s probably no chance it will show... So what happens now? Does this mean that my name and/or address will be flagged and I won&#039;t be able to make any subsequent orders? <br /><br />vendor(99): I would check with your post office just tell them your address and see if they have any letters / packages for you.<br />You should be fine no matter what as long as you deny ownership or having any knowledge of what was in the package.<br />To be safe I would use a different address from now on but it shouldn&#039;t be a huge deal<br /><br />me: Ok I&#039;ll do that tomorrow after work. Just wondering though, what might cause them to not deliver the package and hold it at the post office?<br /><br />vendor(99): May have not fit in the mail box.<br /><br />me: Hey, just got back from the post office. They asked for my I.D. and went into the back to check for packages but didn&#039;t come up with anything. <br /><br />vendor(99): That&#039;s very strange, it may have been lost in the mail system or taken by someone else.<br />We don&#039;t refund untracked orders only express.<br /><br />me: Ugghh so that&#039;s it?... I&#039;m left with nothing?<br /><br />vendor(99): Sorry it didn&#039;t work out but I did my end of the bargain I can&#039;t be held responsible for USPS faults or anyone else that may have intervened <br /><br />me: I&#039;m not blaming you, but I just feel like I did everything correctly on my end too and it doesn&#039;t really seem fair that you get not only what you paid but also the profit you made by selling to me, and I am left with nothing. Just feels like I&#039;m getting fucked here, but oh well, I&#039;ll live. Thanks anyways.<br /><br />vendor(99): Only express is tracked so if we refunded anyone that simply claimed they didn&#039;t get a package we would be broke sorry :/

				personally i would take it to the resolution center if its an amount of $ you don&#039;t want to lose. The only downside is the refund rate, because i know a lot of vendors dont deal with people who have a refund rate of any %. best of luck to you

				Be sure your house is clean and order from another domestic vendor that uses tracking.<br /><br />My hunch is that the vendor scammed you.&nbsp; The &quot;May have not fit in the mail box&quot; is what really makes me think that.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine they sent you a large package for a little bit of MDMA.<br /><br />Recommending that you go ask USPS about an illegal package was horrible advice anyway.&nbsp; They would have left it at your door or left a slip if that wasn&#039;t an option.

				I&#039;m a newb here too so I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve gathered though, it looks like I could have waited 15 days without finalizing and then something happens, and perhaps I could have gotten my money back.&nbsp; But I just wanted to leave feedback to warn others about what happened to me.&nbsp; Not too worried about the money.&nbsp; I just want to figure out what I did wrong so that I don&#039;t repeat my mistake and so that I can hopefully receive a package next time.&nbsp;

				Try following the suggestions of many of the posters who originally post in this topic, but if all else fails, try using SR&#039;s Resolve. Usually they can help come bring some third-party arbitration in and you may be lucky enough to get a full refund or another package resent. But do not do this just to try and get more free drugs (if you did in fact receive it), because SR is a great community that works partly on trust, and if you have too many vendors refuse to continue seller because of buyers taking advantage. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what you did here, but just to let you know most shipments go through okay (like a 95%+ rate of success). Sure, it sucks when a package gets intercepted or loses its way through the postal service, but it does happen. Give it another chance, buy something cheap from a reputable seller and you might find it to be a one time thing. I myself have made over 20 successful orders and 1 failed order (but the failure was on my part for supplying an incorrect address)

				I can&#039;t help but think that somethings up here.&nbsp; because I would think by now I would have either received a letter stating that my package had been confiscated, or that my door would be busted down by the police.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to pursue getting my money back, because as I have said, it is a small amount.&nbsp; I guess the best case scenario is that the vendor did in fact never send a package and just kept my money.&nbsp; Because if this is the case, I shouldn&#039;t have any problems ordering from another better selected vendor.&nbsp; Really the only thing that I&#039;m worried about is my address being flagged so that any orders I make will be inspected closely and will never be received by me, at least that&#039;s what I assume would be the case.&nbsp;

				The fact that they said to actually goto the post office and ask, seems pretty suspicious. At the least its horrible advice. It would be hard to deny knowing anything about a package if you have gone out of your way to pick it up. Unfortanetly now that you have finalized you cant take it to resolution.&nbsp; <br />Just maybe try ordering a very small amount of something and see if it gets through.

				Wow the vendor told you to actually go to the PO and see if it was there??!! :o I def would have never ever done that, if it got intercepted you would have gotten the original package with a letter saying soemthing along the lines of your address has been flagged and illegal contraband was found in a pack marked for your address.... and that if you want the contraband back you can come to the PO or PD and pick it up at your own descretion, meaning if you really wanna get arressted for this just try and come get it.&nbsp; I have never dealt with this &#039;insta gram&#039; vendor so I certainly cant speak personally to his practices... but not tracking a package is a big no no. It costs like .80 and its PROOF to everyone involved.
