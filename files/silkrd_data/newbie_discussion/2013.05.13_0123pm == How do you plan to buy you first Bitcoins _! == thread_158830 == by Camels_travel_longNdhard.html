				So I&#039;ve been looking for my options to buying bitcoins, I m very concerned in keeping high anonymity. Here is a list of options I&#039;ve gathered from research and my thoughts on them. The list does not enlist by all means all the possible ways, but more a few hand picked mthods that appealed to me and/or appear to be the most used.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The most simple way seems to be to buy from Mt.Gox with a bank account, juggle the coins through few wallets before using them on SR.<br />My thoughts: It certainly seems to me not the best way in terms of anonymity but it is probably a fast and secure way of doing it<br /><br />2.Localbitcoins.com, some Sellers will give you the options To deposit the cash into their bankaccount.<br />My thoughts: the site has a good reputation the only thing thing that I cannot remember is whether you need an ID while you deposit the money. If you don&#039;t then it is certainly a very viable way of obtaining bitcoins.<br /><br />3. Bitinstant cash deposit vi monyegram etc...<br />My thoughts: Not available for where i live.... Pity as it seems the most used method on SR.<br /><br />4. Virwox.com allows you a multitude of options amongst them the option of buying with a credit card. <br />My Thoughts: After a lot of research i like this method the most. With the use of a pre-paid credit card this can be quite anonymous. The only drawback is Skrill the moneybookers service Via which you buy the SLL currency which then u trade into bitcoins are very wary of anything suspicious and i already had my account locked on first attempt. Frustrating, but a necessary learning curve i guess.<br /><br /><br />So how do you plan to buy your first Bitcoins ?<br /><br />Any of the usual SR travelers would like to add some more novel ways that i missed ?

				Seems to me that you&#039;ve got the most popular options covered.<br /><br />Washing the coins by passing them through other wallets before they get to SR is something that a lot of people do.<br />Remember though, buying bitcoins is perfectly legal. So there&#039;s no real need to use a pre-paid cc in my opinion.<br /><br />As I&#039;m in the uk, I can only speak for the method I use here.<br />I buy coins at bitbargain.co.uk using an app called &quot;pingit&quot;. It allows people to send money to others using just a phone number.<br />I top up my Pingit account using my VISA card. Then I buy coins at bitbargain. I send the seller money via pingit, and they release the coins. I then pass my coins through instawallet then bitcoinfog, then onto SR - which also tumbles the coins. <br /><br /><br />Most people seem to favour mtgox or localbitcoins. tbh though, sounds like you&#039;ve done your research.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				virwox is my way. Being able to purchase with credit card is very handy option for me as I live quite far from any other. There is a 24hour and 30 day limit on how much you can spend, but they seem to have good e-mail communication. So a simple e-mail with a good explanation and the limit can be raised again. (not guaranteed).

				Number 4 may require you to use a verified gift card. So, you may still need to give all your real info to make the purchase. Not sure how anonymous you can make #4 be. Bitinstant you can use money gram and one other type of cash deposit locations as well as walmarts and CVS&#039;s. You don&#039;t have any of those?

				bitbargain.com is the one I use. If you wait for the right time you can get a pretty good rate, and the service is fast and efficient. It has some similarities to the silk road in the sense that peoples reputations give you more security in making a transaction.

				Bitinstant seems like a really good place to start buying bitcoins. As a question from someone who has never bought from bitinstant before to others that have, what payment method did you use?

				I have used many different methods to purchase BTC.&nbsp; If you are looking to get some almost immediately or same day completely anonymously, I would suggest localbitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason is that you can purchase them from people with cash in person (ANONYMOUS), Dwolla (NOT ANONYMOUS), Paypal (NOT ANONYMOUS), Bank Deposit (ANONYMOUS).&nbsp; <br /><br />Another really great one I have just come across for both vendors and buyers is https://coinbase.com&nbsp; &nbsp;You can link up your bank account and buy Bitcoins as you need them at the going rate with no fees.&nbsp; You can also send and receive BTC to and from this wallet.&nbsp; If you need to sell the Bitcoins to dollars, there is just a 1% transaction fee plus a .15 bank fee, and then your USD go right into your bank account.&nbsp; Obviously this is not anonymous, but if you use it wisely, you will have no trouble. Here is how:<br /><br />It is not illegal to purchase bitcoins, so once you have them, send them through another free wallet for a tiny tiny BTC transaction fee, and then from that other wallet to your SR account.&nbsp; Then change the BTC address you just used on your SR accounts as well as your intermediary wallet to cover your tracks. This will add just a little extra security in the digital trail.<br /><br />But if you need to go completely anonymous on this and don&#039;t mind paying a bit of a premium, localbitcoins.com is by far the best thing out there for document-less cash transactions.

				I don&#039;t get why so many people are worried about anonymously purchasing BTC. I totally understand that selling substantial amounts of BTC might attract attention, but buying them is totally legal. Whenever they ask at the bank why I&#039;m depositing cash to an online trading website, I say I&#039;m buying BTC stocks and bonds.

				It is not illegal to buy bitcoin but you might want to buy something that is illegal with it. In theory the bitcoin used to buy something illegal could be traced back to the transaction with which you bought it and if that transaction involved a bank account, paypal account etc. then it would be traceable back to the owner of the real world account.<br /><br />I guess if the feds were able to hack a suppliers bitcoin storage and then deploy some serious digi-voodoo on their coin then they could bust you. In practice it seems pretty unlikely that they would go that far unless you were involved with some very very dark shit or large quantities of stuff. Has bitcoin evidence ever been used in legal proceedings does anyone know?<br /><br />Anyway, I recently did my first bitcoin buy - cash in the mail to a reputable vendor on here (like ebay, check the feedback, number of transactions, forum posts etc.). I couldn&#039;t be bothered to learn about washing coin and it just didn&#039;t feel right using bank or Paypal for this. It all worked out fine - the conversion rate was a little wack and I had to chase him a little bit but the coin popped up right in my SR account about 30 hours after I posted the cash.<br /><br />You want anonymity? Cash in the mail rules.
