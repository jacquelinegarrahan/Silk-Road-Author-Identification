				So, like a lot of other newbies on here I wish I&#039;d gotten on the bitcoin train when it first left the station. But since I didn&#039;t, I&#039;m looking for some now. I was wondering if there&#039;s a reliable site you all go to that shows what they&#039;re selling for and sells them? I found a couple sites through articles online, none of them seem to make it very easy so far as I&#039;ve seen so far. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.

				I personally use blue sky traders. do a search and you will find a very positive review thread of their services in the rumor mill forum. the way it works is you send them an email telling them how much you want to spend and your btc wallet, they send you an email back with instructions for a bank deposit, you got to a bank of america branch and fill out a deposit slip and hand that and your cash to a teller (none of your info is needed since its a deposit), and then the btc ends up in the wallet.<br /><br />There are a ton of other options though.

				If you&#039;re like me, and want them quickly with very little hassle so that you can purchase something, I would recommend coinXchange on SR.<br /><br />I bought a moneypak at walmart with cash, went home and found coinXchange&#039;s listing on SR, sent him the required info... and I had my coins in less than an hour.<br /><br />He got them at the MTgox low price of the hour when I did it but it could change.&nbsp; He only charged me 4% which was nice too.

				No problem!&nbsp; Also, if you&#039;re going to go buy a moneypak, make sure its at least 200 bucks worth... thats the minimum coinxchange will do im pretty sure.
