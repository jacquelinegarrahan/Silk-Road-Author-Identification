				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Right i am very new to all of this but very interested in the whole concept and Silk Road.<br /><br />However, i am stuck at the second hurdle i guess, i can not figure out for the life of me how to get any bitcoins into my SR wallet!<br /><br />I am from the UK and want to deposit a total of around 30 pounds via bank&nbsp; transfer. Has anyone got any recommendations in terms of third party exchangers?<br />Is it best to use Tor browser when visiting bitcoins exchangers, i was blocked (i think) by one vendor as i was using Tor browser.<br /><br />Is it best to give false details like email,name etc, to bitcoin vendors? to play it safe?<br /><br />Any help is much welcomed, i REALLY NEED your help guys,<br /><br />Ok thank you very much.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Like BitInstant, etc. Don&#039;t visit Mt.Gox through TOR, in-fact, don&#039;t use Mt.Gox PERIOD. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure either on what the UK&#039;s banking situation is like versus the US, but you should look up the individual sites you wish to use on here, or somewhere else to see if they&#039;re TOR-friendly or not, before ultimately making any decision on which browser to use. When TOR can be used, TOR should be used. That&#039;s my MOTO.&nbsp; ;D

				from the research I&#039;ve done, and you&#039;ll see it as you read through that site i linked there is nothing illegal about buying bitcoins so no need for tor while doing that. imo.

				ARGHHH disaster! well almost lol the link you sent me attisal suggests&nbsp; bitInstant to get bitcoins, HOWEVER, they only allow people from certain countries to buy bitcoins like US, Ukraine etc. <br /><br />Any other suggestions please would be very helpful.<br /><br />Thank you once again.<br /><br />

				as I said I&#039;m US based so Bitinstant worked for me like a charm. a quick google search served up 4 or 5 options for the UK here are links for 3. do your research before you decide on one.<br /><br />https://bitbargain.co.uk/â€Ž<br />howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/in/united-kingdom<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_(the_newbie_version)
