				You won&#039;t let this forum trace the Agents attacking our community? You&#039;re still standing up for the snot nosed faggot that put this whole operation at risk, let alone allegedly tried to hire Hitmen? Fuck you and your double standards, DPR may of had his own set of morals but don&#039;t try and make it sound like he was at all righteous. This stupid cunt didn&#039;t follow any of protocols set in place to protect him and US and you&#039;re still defending him? Fuck you. You stupid brown nosing cunt, think we didn&#039;t read how much you were getting paid?<br />

				That&#039;s not even the worst part. He claims this whole thing was non violent, yet the leader got it all shut down trying to hire fucking hitmen. Does nobody else see a problem with this?<br /><br />I say yeah Fuck the LE. If there are people on here willing/able to trace them to let them know they&#039;re being watched just like we are, LET THEM. Don&#039;t work against us Cirrus. It either makes you look like you&#039;re too &quot;loyal&quot; to DPR or you yourself are LEO.

				The whole talk of calling a hit on someone sounds very dubious to me. Also dont forget it makes him sound like the violent drug kingpin they want him to look like.

				&quot;He did what he had to do&quot; -&nbsp; This MAY be true, but I&#039;m sure some of the vendors possible loosing tens or hundreds of thousand bucks feel like that HAVE to trace down some of the agents responsible. In case you can&#039;t gather it from my original post, I think sometimes violence and threats ARE necessary. But don&#039;t try and make all these Vendors and Buyers follow rules about violence when even people at the top don&#039;t.<br /><br />
