				Hello. Waaaw SR has changed many things and the btc is way more expensive as the last day i was here.<br />I was here a seller and also a buyer.<br /><br />My question is if people are still interested in benzo&#039;s made in Belgium? I sold always Flunitrazepam (roofies) and methadone caps off 20mg/capsul. Also Alprazolam 2mg and Roche Valium 10mg.<br /><br />A lot is changed but if anyone is interested in one of the products then i will see how to get a vendor account again :). I am not a big player i just sell what i get on prescription so...100% legit, from pharmacy untouched to your door :p.<br /><br />Nice to be back<br /><br />Greettzz<br /><br />Ps : Pm me with any questions

				Hi Grizzen,<br /><br />Welcome back man. All I can say is you must be getting one fucking huge prescription from your Dr to make it worthwhile being a vendor, after buying the vendors account etc etc - It surely wouldn&#039;t be worth it unless you&#039;re one lucky fucker and gets 100&#039;s of tablets a month on script.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you get a private script so you can pretty much choose what and how much they give you (at a price)? Otherwise I find it hard to believe you&#039;ll make a worthwhile sum on a &#039;normal&#039; script.<br /><br />But hey, good luck if you decide to come back.<br /><br />

				@Japan<br />I see the SR has changed on many things. I get my meds on prescription from the doctor and the Flunitrazepam (roofies) i get 6 boxes a month, so that is total of 60 roofies. Also Alprazolam 2mg and i still have a huge stock off methadone off 20mg caps.<br /><br />Also some 8 to 12gr hash.<br /><br />I have to think about it if i want to become a vendor again + i must know if the members are still looking for Flunitrazepam (roofies).<br />Oh well i must see when i have enough cash for a vendors accoount because here on the street i do not wanna sell, to much police these days and also hard to find costumers. I only find costumers for my H nr 3 i sometimes have and i search a 100ug Durogesic/Fentanyl patch.<br /><br />Oh well i will see if there are some respected members so that i can send a sample from my roofies so they can say it is legit.<br />To bad that i never managed to buy btc but always orderd things with the btc i earned as a seller :D.<br /><br />But to many big players around i see for the moment.<br /><br />Thx for the reply Japan ;-)

				From that post I reckon you would do well, and have enough supply to make a nice profit each month.<br /><br />I vote you come back and serve the road&nbsp; :D<br />I&#039;d definitely make a purchase from you if you delivered to the UK.<br /><br />Either way good luck man, and all the best&nbsp; 8)
