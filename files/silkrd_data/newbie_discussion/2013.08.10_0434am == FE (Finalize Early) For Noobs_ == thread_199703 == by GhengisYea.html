				I see this all over the place on storefronts:<br /><br />Less than X amount of transactions must FE!<br /><br />Is this really standard practice?&nbsp; It seems like the most potential for getting fucked is your first few transactions via selective scamming.&nbsp; Other than just going to a reputable vendor and hoping for the best, is there any other way to minimize risk of a deal turning sour early on?

				Check forum for reviews. If a listing appears too good to be true, then it is. Do not FE. If a vendor that you want to use requires that you FE, then don&#039;t use him.

				From what I&#039;ve read you should never FE. Most reputable vendors won&#039;t even ask you to FE if you have good stats.

				ive FEd a few times and more often its not worth it, vendors get the order, then send you a message you gotta FE, when you agree, then they put in transit ....... NOW with time zones and that crap, now your order is delayed at least a day or 2, once you FE then the vendor (usually!!! but not all the time) will take his sweet time shipping out your order ( i am still waiting on a&nbsp; FE order that i ordered on sunday 8/3).&nbsp; &nbsp;ok out of the FE orders, 1 was a ripoff(never got anything, vendor banned for scamming alot), 1 was awesome fast ETC (addyhashking), 4 were ok but slow, and 1 is slow as hell am still waiting. out of the vendors that never make me FE, ALL of them were FAST as hell, and product was great! SOOOOOOOO.......... The moral of the story is if the vendors are requiring you to FE your cheating yourself, and having to deal with unwanted bullshit. your best off goin with vendors that dont demand FE. ive decided cause of the BS i wont FE anymore unless its from a vendor who ive done business with and is cool. Good luck!

				This is a somewhat standard practice for vendors dealing with newbies.<br /><br />You could easily screw over a vendor and make a new account to screw him over, Again. If you don&#039;t like the vendors practices, don&#039;t bitch about them, move on. There&#039;s plenty of vendors on the road.

				I just asked upfront if it was OK to not FE and always had an answer. If the vendor didn&#039;t agree, I just tried another one.

				I really don&#039;t mind FE-ing, if the vendor has plenty feedback, why not? I&#039;m the newbie, not them.

				Research the vendors u wanna use and see what others have said :) if u dont wanna FE then find a vendor that has this option for newcomers otherwise u will have to &quot;risk it for a biscuit&quot; ;) the vendors take the same chance dealing with newcomers as you take with them. I didnt mind FE on my first few orders here and luckily everything worked out nicely 8)

				I&#039;ve found that you can always find a non-FE vendor for whatever product you need. Mainly new vendors looking for stats, or maybe a bit more expensive because of the risk they&#039;re taking

				I have yet to order from the road and have the same concerns as you. After reviewing the forums and the road (daily), ive noticed theres really no way around Not FE&#039;ing with quite a few vendors. We are all taking risks but as newb buyers their risk is much bigger then our own. Best bet (or my plan to be my best bet lol)? When all my ducks are aligned I&#039;ll buy a few digital items to get a little bit of status as a buyer, then create a list of vendors im interested in purchasing from. Message them to to verify if I must FE, if so go on to the next and scratch them my list.<br /><br />Plenty of vendors to choose from, prices vary but if you dont want to FE (like myself for the size of orders i plan on making), you might have to pay a higher price for the product.. just my current observations.
