				I haven&#039;t smoked in decades, and have zero aquantainces from which I could reasonably acquire bud...so I&#039;m a little out of my element.<br /><br />I&#039;m contemplating a purchase of an eighth, but I&#039;m worried about what kind of BS charges would be tacked on if I were busted, given that the source is going to be out of state.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a rental mailbox i can use, good command of the tools to securely order, I just don&#039;t want to wind up with a felony for 40 dollars worth of (hopefully good) shit vs the misdemeanor i would get for buying it from some dude in town.<br /><br />

				My reading of this:<br /><br />http://norml.org/laws/item/ohio-penalties-2<br /><br />would indicate that you&#039;ll be ok, but I am not a lawyer. It seems like the term &quot;trafficking&quot; is reserved for SELLING marijuana, which you would not be doing. Possession of up to 100g (3.5oz) only gets you a $150 fine.<br /><br />Someone else might be able to read the law better than I, but I think you might be in the clear.

				That&#039;s the way I read it as well.&nbsp; Even &#039;trafficking&#039; for less than 20 grams is a misdemeanor...but as you say, the language is about prepping, packaging, shipping when there is reasonable suspicion of intent for resale.<br /><br />Maybe i&#039;ll see if i can get a vendor to ship a couple rose buds as a test.&nbsp; :)

				Well, there is something you have to realize; federal law trumps state law. Regardless of marijuana being decriminalized at a state level, it is still illegal under federal law.<br /><br />If by chance you were caught receiving controlled substances (in this case, marijuana) through the mail and the Feds got involved, you could still be charged at a federal level.<br /><br />Just order from a vendor who knows what they are doing and you should not have any issues.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				The federal government is omnipresent and it has jurisdiction over interstate commerce.&nbsp; Under federal law possession is a crime.&nbsp; That being said, they usually defer to the local jurisdiction for cases involving small amounts.<br />You&#039;ve got little to worry about though, no postal inspectors are looking for 1/8s of weed.<br />

				As a resident of the state of Ohio I Feel like the laws around Marijuana are quickly disappearing. I believe for the most part the use of silk road for buying marijuana can become better or worse depending on the size and situation. There is a certain level of safety when using the silk road and i believe some people can respect that, in some instances the use of silk road can eliminate the need for a local guy. You get a high quality product and you spend a pretty penny to get it, the products on silk road are appreciated the buyer is usually getting the best of the best. So in theory i believe using the silk road to buy certain products is viewed as better than buying form a local dealer, but being the devils advocate I can also see the police using the silk road against you, If the silk road only sold marijuana it wouldn&#039;t be an issue but the silk road is associated with many illicit drugs including GHB and DMT.&nbsp;

				Of course there is additional risk of &quot;charges. You&#039;ll be receiving it via the federal USPS and most likely across state lines. That being said, I still think it&#039;s pretty damn safe.
