				Looking for some tips on return addresses. I have heard they should be real, just not connected to you.<br /><br />Shipping out a USPS bluebox, what if i put a return address outside of the city, county, or state for that matter?

				Find a random small store in town and use the address and name for a return address if its not connected to you its good, and its real so it wont arise suspicion. If you put a return address outside of the city that is raising a flag.

				This. <br />Also doesn&#039;t hurt to pick a small business you might know that won&#039;t call the cops right away if they happen to receive the package

				It seems to me that using a return address in a box in a different area than the actual address could potentially bring some scrutiny, but that may just be me being paranoid. I just think that if I were a postal employee one of the first things I&#039;d look for in profiling would be a series of packages from the next town/county/state over being sent from my location, because my thinking would be why are all these people coming here to send out their mail?<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend picking up a P.O. box and using that as your return address with real info or at least use separate addresses for sending/receiving/buying/selling. Hope this was helpful in the least and good luck!

				I&#039;ve watched the guy collect mail from the blue drop boxes. He pulls out a tall yellow bin of mail, slaps an empty bin in the box, throws the full bin on his truck. The whole thing takes about sixty seconds, and the last thing he&#039;s got time for is checking to see if any of the mail has return addresses from somewhere else.<br /><br />Probably the biggest thing to worry about with regard to actual mail carriers is that they suspect your package contains drugs... and then steal it! Postal inspectors in the big mail hubs, maybe a different story.

				Use a real return address to a local small business (as stated before) that has a mail drop nearby and put it in that bin. As long as you seal your product properly and dont leave prints on your shit you are fine.
