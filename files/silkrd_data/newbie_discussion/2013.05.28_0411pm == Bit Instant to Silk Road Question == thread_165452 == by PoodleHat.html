				<br /><br />I was wondering if I would be able to deposit cash at Walmart using BitInstant directly to my SR address by selecting the Bitcoin Address under &quot;Send To&quot; on BitInstant and putting in my SR address. Will it automatically convert my money into BC&#039;s on SR? <br /><br />I realize this may not be the SAFEST way as you should transfer to MtGox and then to a wallet etc. but MtGox requires you to buy at least 1 BC and right now that&#039;s 128$ US which... being a first timer I don&#039;t want to risk. Again I realize this probably isn&#039;t the most UNTRACEABLE way but please let me know if it&#039;s possible to deposit the money via Walmart using BitInstant directly to SR using the address and whether it will then convert to BC&#039;s.<br /><br />Otherwise, if this is not possible or HIGHLY risky are there any bitcoin exchangers that do not require you to buy at least 1 BC? I only want to spend 60-80 bucks for the first and probably my only time. I&#039;m curious about silk road and have been doing my research but can&#039;t find anything whether you can deposit directly...<br /><br /><br />THANKS IN ADVANCE

				Hey,<br />As you already know its not the safest option. You should transfer it into a wallet (there are free no fee ones) and then into SR. But if you accept the risks (which are really only present if your buying bulk etc) you can in fact just transfer funds directly into your SR account from bitinstant. Your SR bitcoin address is just like a regular one so it works the same way.<br />--Express Connect

				Express,<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks alot for the fast reply, that&#039;s kind of my attitude and honestly SWIM is buying a very small amount of product and am not overly concerned with direct deposit just wanted to make sure it WOULD indeed work. Thanks alot!
