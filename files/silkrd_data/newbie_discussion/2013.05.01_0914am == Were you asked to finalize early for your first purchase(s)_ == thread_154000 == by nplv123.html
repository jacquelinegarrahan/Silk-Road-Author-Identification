				No, I wasn&#039;t. There are plenty of vendors who don&#039;t demand fe from newbies. Use them until you&#039;ve built a transaction record then move on.

But around a week later it appeared! <br /><br />Being a naive newbie (I started ordering before I discovered the Forum) I FE&#039;d on the vendors request - I am very lucky it all worked out. My advice is never FE as you can build up your order history in other ways. If you do, make sure it is a for a tiny order, for a sum you can lose and not be too badly affected.<br /><br />PB.

				Exactly what Hryder said.<br /><br />&nbsp;But to give you more of an image of what to expect in the wild here&#039;s a guide on what you&#039;ll see.<br /><br />ALWAYS FE (normally a scammer especially if theyre a new account<br /><br />FE to Certain zones<br /><br />FE for people with under a certain amount of money spent<br /><br />FE to people who have a certain amount of transactions OR money spent<br /><br /><br />My tip to you is to stick to vendors who dont require you to FE, and also to make small purchases first.<br />You can buy E-Books for 20-90 cents each to build up your transaction history but your money spent will still be low. This will assist you in not having to FE almost ever after your first order, unless you&#039;re trying to spend a few 1000$ your second transaction some sellers may ask you to gain more experience as people with low stats can easily be scammers and scammers do start to get expensive over time for vendors.<br />

				nice thanks for the advice. just checked and 1/3 of my orders is in transit already. wish it was a different order though lol, theres one i really wanna get asap and thats the one im nervous about being required to fe. its only a 1.5ish btc transaction, hopefully the vendor wont ask because the price and quantity was exactly what i was looking for and if i have to go through another vendor ill have to deposit more btc to get the amount i want cause i already spent the extra i had

				As the others have said never FE if you can help it. I&#039;ve never ever had to FE personally.<br /><br />Use the forums to spot out who are trustworthy vendors, that may want FE. Also, always check feedback scores and comments - many, many people have been scammed by FE&#039;ing. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry though - if you&#039;re sensible about who you buy from you&#039;ll be fine&nbsp; 8)

				I was asked to FE by HollyMolly for my first transaction since it was for nearly $8,000.00. I ordered 3 weeks ago and havent received my package yet. Some people have been having issues with Holly Molly as of lately, but when I ordered they had 98 feedback with over 300 transactions. Sent three messages and have had no communication over the last week but I know SR has been fucked lately. <br /><br />Keeping my fingers crossed that all will work out! Wish I would have read the forums more closely before I ordered.

				As others mentioned, I looked for vendors who didn&#039;t require it. As an added courtesy I sent each a PM just to confirm what I read in their porfile and to ensure they were okay with new customers. Every vendor except one replied. Each reply was friendly.

				No, but my order was under 2bc. I suppose I would FE if it was required and a could not find what I wanted elsewhere.

				No, I only bought from vendors who didn&#039;t require it. Now that I have a good amount of transactions and money spent, I can buy from those who wouldve required it if I was new. It also helps that I have 0% autofinalize/refund rate

				I wasn&#039;t asked for my first purchase, but for what would&#039;ve been my 5th purchase(8 mg dilaudid) a vendor who is no longer here I believe,exotica, told me that since I had less than 5 successful transactions (I was at 4, for almost 2000 dollars)I would need to FE.&nbsp; It was like 45 bucks,so I didn&#039;t think much of it . wasn&#039;t THAT big a deal to me, and he was the only one I could find who had the item stocked at the time.&nbsp; Of course, I got fucked over. Glad I learned my lesson early, and on such a small purchase, rather than FE&#039;ing for like a pound of weed or something. That would fucking suck. I personally will never FE again.&nbsp;
