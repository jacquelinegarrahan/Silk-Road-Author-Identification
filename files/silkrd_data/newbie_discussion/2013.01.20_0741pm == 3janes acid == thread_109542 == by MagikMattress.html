				Hello, I have a question about her acid. I just received her new batch that she sent out and I was wondering if you guys think it is close to the advertised dose (~90ug)? My two other friends and I plan on taking two each today and was wondering if that would be good for our first time?

				I never tried it but Jane is known to be very honest about her acid, so I think you can kind of trust it. 180 should be a good trip, strong but not insane, wich is good for a first time i think.<br /><br />Good luck

				Thanks for the quick reply. I have only read wonderful things about her acid and just wanted to be cautious and ask.

				If you know the acid is good and clean I would say the sky is the limit when it comes to the dose.<br /><br />What I would do is eat one tab each to make sure it&#039;s completely tasteless. If there is no taste to it I would proceed to eat 3 more tabs and pop that cherry with a BANG.

				With 3Jane, you always get accurate dosage information.&nbsp; She won&#039;t sell a batch unless she&#039;s happy with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think 180ug is a great first dose.&nbsp; A good show of what it&#039;ll give you without going balls out.&nbsp; I think 2 is a great choice. :)

				What are you payin per hit?&nbsp; Did you get chills running up the spine, any quick split second pains, then it disappears?&nbsp; Good clean acid is way better than the cut shit.&nbsp;

				While 3Jane&#039;s tabs haven&#039;t been lab tested YET, they have always been honestly advertised. I&#039;d advise 2.

				Enjoy the first time! Depending on the &#039;cid, two tabs would be an enjoyable trip but nothing really profound, you know? I&#039;d say 3 or 4 might just make you &#039;trip balls&#039;

				I&#039;d definitely not advise someone to eat more than 2 tabs their first time with LSD.&nbsp; It&#039;s very beautiful but if you&#039;ve never experienced it before I could see it easily being overwhelming.&nbsp; And honestly, I&#039;d prefer to have an underwhelming experience than an 8 hour long overwhelming one. <br /><br />Although I suppose if you have some xanax on hand go for the extra tab. :D
