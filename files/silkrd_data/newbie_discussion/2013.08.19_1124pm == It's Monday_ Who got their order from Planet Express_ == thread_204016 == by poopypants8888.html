				Ordered on tuesday, paid priority, PE said would be shipped out wednesday or thursday... Still nothing. What a piece of shit.<br /><br />And I was one of the one&#039;s who was still holding out hope.<br /><br />Fucking scamming asshole.<br /><br />My fault in the end though.

				I guess I don&#039;t really know anything about Planet Express.&nbsp; Not taking into consideration that he may or may not be a scammer isn&#039;t it too soon to consider a package lost?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had priority packages take 7-8 delivery days.&nbsp;

				I hear what you&#039;re saying about priority taking 7 or 8 days in extreme circumstances. To that I say in the past week this douchebag thief has had ~150 new orders. It seems that ONE of those people should&#039;ve received something today. Maybe not all of them or even half but one out of over 100 would seem like a fair assumption.<br /><br />I made this thread to ask if anyone who has ordered from him actually received their item. (outside of the samples he sent out in the early stage of his vendorship)

It seems like they&#039;ve been getting crazy amounts of orders (as to be expected with the prices they&#039;re selling their product at).<br /><br />That being said, they do have great reviews but there are reports of people putting in orders and then getting a PM saying their order won&#039;t be shipped out until the FE. Also when you look at a listing like their 30mg oxycodone listing, there were a bunch of discrepancies with quantity, showing a lot more after placing in your cart etc. Not to mention the price! $0.50/mg is pretty much unheard of now, especially on the road where prices are marked up due to risks/shipping and packaging costs/cost of convenience.<br /><br />I would be careful, wait for this week to go by, and watch the vendor and his reviews/forum posts before biting the bullet on the purchase.&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t trust feedback alone, vendors generate false reviews in the hundreds. Another clue for noobs is to check when listings are releasesed, when vendors pump out dozens of listings simultaneously for different drugs at below average SR price chances are it&#039;s too good to be true
