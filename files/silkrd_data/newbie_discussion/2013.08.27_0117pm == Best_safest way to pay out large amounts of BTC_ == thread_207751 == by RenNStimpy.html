				Hey,<br />I&#039;m really wondering about what is the safest way to pay out large amounts of Bitcoins? I really don&#039;t want to directly transfer big amounts to my bank account because history always showed that this often made authorities suspicious.<br />But how then? Is the best way to simply pay it out in rates? Like every other month you send 500€ max. or so? What if I need more though?<br /><br />How do you people handle this?

				5000$ limit is quite good. My definition is pretty much something around 1.000€-10.000€.<br />Are these Vanilla Reload cards available in Europe?

				You can register on localbitcoins.com and have people bring you cash. If you set a good rate no more than 2% of MTGox anyone in your area will come to you. Then there is no one to say how many you have sold.

				So ok I found another possibility on localbitcoins guys. You can sell for PayPal there.<br /><br />How does PayPal handle receiving an amount of like 1000 and a bit euros on there?

				I heard that guy tell his story directly (maybe we are talking about two different people) however this person said they were on SR and they hardly ever buy anything. He was talking with someone via PM on SR and he told them his localbitcoins username, a few days later RMCP came to his door. He was up in Canada with an Avalon no less, back when those were profitable to own and relatively cheap.
