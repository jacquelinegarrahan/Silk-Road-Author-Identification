				A few weeks ago me and some friends took 2 jersey cow avatars and had a great trip. My brother (who&#039;s never done LSD) wanted to try to it. I found that my dumbass left it on the top shelf of the fridge directly underneath the light for like 2 weeks. I was concerned it had been weakened, but gave him just one anyways to see if he liked it. He got giggly for about an hour.... then nothing. No pupil dilation, no warm and fuzzies, no introspection, nothing. I figured the acid went bad so I ordered some from lucydrop. Again, me and my friends each took one jersey and two lucydrops and had the best trip of our lives. Now it&#039;s a week later and I gave my bro two lucydrops. Again, no pupil dilation, no visuals, really no effects to speak of. WTF? Is he immune to LSD?

				The light in the fridge isn&#039;t on when the door&#039;s closed, dude! Plus it&#039;s only ultraviolet that&#039;ll destroy it, not regular light... and a fridge light is like, thousands of times weaker than sunlight is, anyway. ;D<br /><br />But if you didn&#039;t wrap it in anything, then any moisture or condensation on the shelf/whatever will have leached the LSD out of the tab, so they&#039;ll likely be weaker than if you&#039;d wrapped &#039;em proper and stuck them somewhere cool and dry like between the pages of a book.<br /><br />He might just have a higher threshold for LSD than you two, or a longer than usual recovery period for his brain to get back to normal. Give it a month, then try him on three tabs at once! :D

				Yeah, there are people with different drug sensitivity. <br />My gf for example cannot get high with weed, and average LSD doses doesn&#039;t do shit.&nbsp; Its funny cause i have higher than average sensitivity, and i can have visuals with only 50-70 mics.<br />Just get him a higher dose, and try stronger psychedelics&nbsp; like 2-cb or DOB.

				His tolerance can be high from doing other psychedelics as well. Shrooms for instance can raise your tolerance for other psychedelics like LSD and DMT. Has he been doing any other psychedelics intermittently?

				No mortal is immune to LSD. Tolerance is almost nonsense as well, cause aside from weight to dose ratio, most all of the people who dont really&nbsp; &#039;feel&#039; anything, when doing durgs..its 99% in their head. If you dont let go and let the drug do its thing, your brain will actually try its best to convince you that you are infact, not fucked up.<br /><br />&nbsp;When I trip, L&nbsp; or mushys or w.e.. unless is a monster dose, I can keep as composed as any other civilian around me. Kinda like sobriety, breeds sobriety. Just as if you only droped one tab, and everyone around you is dosed to the teeth, you will feel that much more out there, than if you would in the supermarket or being around people that do not or can&nbsp; not know that your intoxicated.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT. I just read through the OP, he didnt trip cause it was his first time. 9/10 people will report feeling a light buzz, if anything at all on their first L dose.. mainly because the average hit any where today is any where from 50-100ug.. where as a decade or three back, any given tab or blotter or drip, wouldnt be anything less than 300mics. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also, go search for a sticky about meth, and dosing.. The meth is irrelevant, but the OP gives an in depth passage about something called pre dosing, which applies to just about any mind altering substance. Esp the strong ones, like LSD. Much loves guys.

				Today was his second attempt at tripping. He&#039;s not on any medications and hasn&#039;t ever tried any other psychedelics. About 4 hours in I had him take another 2 hits, so about 400ug total in 6 hours. It&#039;s now two hours after the second two hits and STILL nothing. His pupils are absolutely normal size. Maybe in a month I should have him drop 4 at once? Or maybe he should try shrooms instead? So weird.

				Nope. No medications whatsoever. Maybe an aspirin here and there. He doesn&#039;t even smoke weed.
