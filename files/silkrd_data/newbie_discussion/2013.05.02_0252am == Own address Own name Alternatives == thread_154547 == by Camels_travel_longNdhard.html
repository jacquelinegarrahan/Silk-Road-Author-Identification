				First I understand some senior members are extremely bored with topics of shipping, I understand that and apologize to make another thread about shipping.<br /><br />I have done a fair bit of reading on the forums and by now have extracted what seems to be the rule that everyone seem to favor : Use your own address, Use your own name. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m interested to know in alternative ways people have successfully used &gt;&gt;irregularly for shipping <br /><br />eg.&nbsp; Old tenants name (verified first via dummy mail)<br /><br />Complete fake names<br /><br />Maybe relatives names that have stayed at your resident in the past<br /><br />Any other creative alternative ?<br /><br />Also what are the safety odds between sending it to your own address vs sending it to a safe house (an accomplice friend).<br /><br />All input is welcomed and appreciated.<br />

				Best to use your own name.&nbsp; If nothing else, its the least likely to raise any suspicion.&nbsp; Why risk it with a fake name?

I&#039;ve never even bothered with that though. I just open sh*t. Thing is, I get so much mail here that isn&#039;t for me anyway that i throw most of it away (i&#039;ve lived here for 2 fucking years - if they can&#039;t change their address by now they clearly don&#039;t want their post :| )<br /><br />I use fake names a lot - never really seen an issue with it. In big cities people have flatmates, friends staying, and people are moving around all the time so theres no way they could keep up. I guess if you live in a small town it might be slightly more risky. Even then though, its only your postman you need to worry about, and really only if you know him/he knows you - the people at the sorting offices don&#039;t give a crap, they&#039;re too busy and too bored to do so, I would imagine. <br /><br />I avoid using old tenants names - as if they&#039;re recent tenants, you run the risk of them having a mail forward set up. Even if you&#039;re getting their post, it doesn&#039;t mean that they don&#039;t have one set up. It just means your postal service are intermittently doing their job. <br /><br />Finally, one thing I sometimes do is drop the first name off the address, and just use a random prefix (mr. miss. ms etc). Not sure why I do this - somehow it makes me feel a bit less anxious about it.

This definitely seems to me one of the most reasonable and simple methods. No trouble with raising suspicions or losing the precious package to being forwarded. <br /><br />
