				My usual vendors were out off stock at the time so i decided to make a order with Winta as he has a pretty good stats<br />I made the express order Monday and Winta said it will be sent Tuesday it should have been here Wensday, it is now friday and since monday i have not had any messages from Winta but he was able to put himself into stealth mode a few nights ago without replying! it seems to me im being totally ignored and it doesnt look like my package was sent out at all.<br />Also as i look around the forums and talk to other SR users, i have seen a admin warned people on this forum that Winta has tryed blackmailing people for a better rating also admitting he keeps there address`s.....<br />Winta states he will reply within a few hours if not sooner....its been 4 days no responce and no mail....<br /><br />

				Re Winta, yeah he drops off the planet from time to time and isn&#039;t too flash providing updates. all I can say in his defence is that &#039;perhaps&#039; he has encountered some sort of serious issue that has prevented him making contact. Last time he did this he reappeared after 15 to 20 days of nada. I just had an info exchange thingy happening with him and now that is hanging. <br /><br />I&#039;ve asked SR if they are able to prompt him but if that isn&#039;t their role or&nbsp; permitted then we are just left to ponder. He also sent me his tormail contact but again nada and tor mail are so ludicrously secretive they won&#039;t even advise if they are able to check to see if anyone has logged into his email. It would at least me nice to know if the guy is still breathing, but clearly that is too confidential or beyond access even for tormail............wallys..

				Hey Scout, you seem a tad belligerent about f/a. For a start I didn&#039;t write that SR are obligated in anyway to check up on or contact vendors who for whatever reason seem to have vanished into the ether. However, I note that SR do have a &quot;Report this Vendor&#039; function that I imagine may be used to lay complaints against a vendor. Presumably SR would try to get the vendors side of the story before ruling on any financial implications or every man and his scout could for whatever twisted reason, log multiple complaints to discredit a vendor. <br />RE the Winta situation, his vanishing act may be out of necessity or it may be that he just doesn&#039;t give a shit. If SR find it too onerous to flick the guy a simple email well then perhaps they may like to charge me 10 bucks on top of the healthy commission they have already received from the thousands of dollars I have pumped through their site. Some very basic steps to keep or at least attempt to keep vendors and buyers in harmony would to my way of thinking be beneficial for all concerned, but hey you clearly view it differently.<br /><br />Additionally, your quip relating to Tormail and that why would they even be concerned about answering queries re users accessing their email account? I too wouldn&#039;t expect them to be &#039;concerned&#039; though providing they are able to access such basic info I really don&#039;t see what the drama would be if they were to provide basic responses such as,&nbsp; No activity last 10 days. Yes Activity last 10 days. They could even charge to provide the info and I doubt that by doing so, anyone would seriously, if at all be compromised. Such info is hardly critical or likely to have any adverse consequences. I wouldn&#039;t give a tinker&#039;s toss if someone knew that I or someone I authorised logged in to my email in the past 10 days. Perhaps that&#039;s coz I&#039;ve got sweet f/a to hide and/or my experience with paranoia has always been as an outsider looking in on and offering support to those clearly suffering from its effects.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah I&#039;m a saint. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/Smileys/default/cool.gif<br />

				No email provider would ever tell someone whether or not a particular user had accessed their email recently ... it would absolutely compromise the safety, security, privacy -- not to mention rights -- of the account holder.

				Scout, and yet if my email provider was to tell you or anyone else breathing that i had accessed my account in the past 10 days, I&#039;m not able to think of one reason how that info would compromise my safety, security blah blah blah in any way. All it merely does it let someone now that I, or someone with access to my account has used it, big deal. It is always encouraging to know that if you send an email the anticipated recipient &#039;seemed&#039; to be alive within the past 10 days. <br /><br />As to email providers and security, assuming that they can access such basic detail none of us know what the f--k they currently do with it anyway, and we never will. <br /><br />Anyhow it was good to see a slightly less antagonistic response from you devoid of silly and multiple !!!???.<br />May you, Tonto. Silver and the Lone Ranger ride long and far.<br />Cheers&nbsp;
