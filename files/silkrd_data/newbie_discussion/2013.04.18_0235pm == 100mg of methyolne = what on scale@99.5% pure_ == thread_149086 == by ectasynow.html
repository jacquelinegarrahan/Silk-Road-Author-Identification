				100mg by definition weighs exactly 100mg... milligrams is a unit of measurement that conveys weight, just like pounds/lbs or ounces/oz. What weight a scale displays depends on what unit of measurement its capable of &amp; set to display, but most scales being used t100o weigh drugs are going to be set to measure weight in grams, in which case 100mg will be displayed as &quot;0.1&quot;. 99.5 per cent purity --&nbsp; &amp; the entire matter of purity in general -- is completely irrelevent to how much a substance weighs.

				Southern m1 is exactly correct. The rule is 80% differential between the two drugs in question. Sounds like southern m1 is the man to ask about these drugs. lol I just had to confirm that his data throughout this discussion has been on point. I like to sit back in the shadows watching who knows what their talking about, and who doesn&#039;t. By the way...blksheep is back!!! 8)

				Although I&#039;ve got extremely good MDA from The ILF and good MDMA from KarmaPharm, some meth from Kush411 I still havent had M1. I have tried to order a sample pack from someone but he hassn&#039;t responded. Is it worth it for the money and can I take it more frequently then MDMA or MDA?

				If you like mdma you will like m1. it will give you the same feeling you just have to take a bit more, however 1 dose of m1 is still cheaper than 1 dose of mdma since it is about 25% the cost of mdma and about 60-80% the potency, ie. its a better bang for your buck

				I cant accurately comment on that since I dont personally use it, however I know people who do it frequently although they may be an exception to the rule I cant say for sure. I would assume it to be equal to mdma or slightly faster recovery time since its not as strong per weight. I will say this, I know personally someone who has been on it for 2 days without sleep if that matters at all?

				Just remember the effects of bk-mdma last half as long as mdma.&nbsp; You can&#039;t redose and get the same effects in the same day.

				Nice to see you here Jack and Thanks I didnt know that. why couldnt you redose to the same extent as mdma since they both affect the same receptors? wouldnt it take the same to overload the receptors just a larger&nbsp; volume in the case of m1 since its not as potent?
