				He pwnt quite a number of US military and NASA computers but got caught doing so. He was fighting extradition to the US for nearly a decade but recently defeated extradition.<br />He claims to have found a list of experimental aircrafts with unique names that are not the names of any known military or space craft as well as a list of &quot;non-terrestrial officers&quot; implying that the US military have space travel technology and units that we are not aware of.<br />He is also severely autistic and in my opinion this leads me be receptive of what he as to say, autistic people generally don&#039;t make shit like this up, lying is generally beyond their comprehension.<br />What he claims is also very similar to some statements made by a CEO of Lockheed Martin on his death bed about 10 years or so ago that has been floating around the interwebs recently. This guy claims that we&#039;ve been reverse engineering alien technology for decades and the US military have been exploring deeper space for quite a long time also.<br /><br />I would pay attention to a lot of what he has to say, especially now that he is not facing extradition.

				I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m only finding out about it more than 10 years after it happened. Its also interesting how in that interview that was put on youtube in 2006 that when he was inside of those computers he saw that other people from around the world were also inside the computers. I don&#039;t doubt anymore that we have technology that&#039;s not being shared with the public which is sad so much potential knowledge hoarded by the &quot;smart&quot; people in our whole society.
