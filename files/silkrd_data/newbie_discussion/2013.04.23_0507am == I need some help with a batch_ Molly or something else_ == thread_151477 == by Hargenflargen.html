				Now, I&#039;ve done a lot of molly, but I recently bought (not off the road, which is the last time I&#039;ll do that) some white powder. I smelled it, and it had that distinct (bitter? I can never describe it) smell I associate with molly, I tasted it, and it was incredibly bitter, tasted like some of the best powder I&#039;ve ever had, (which was last summer)<br /><br />I took it one night, mixed it with a cup of water and gulped it down, and rolled lightly. When I bumped that night, I rolled quite well (for a short time, obviously, I don&#039;t bump often)<br />When I gave some to a friend, I gave her at least .3 and she didn&#039;t roll at all.<br /><br />But here&#039;s the problem: I tested twice, with two different marquis regent tests, one fizzed and turned yellow, one fizzed and turned a darker orange. Both point to methamphetamine or amphetamine. Both tests (one a single use, one a dropper) I bought around December of 2012. I stored them in a drawer, and never opened either until receiving this.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what to think, is it not molly? When I tried it the first night I just thought it might not be very pure, but since my friend didn&#039;t roll at all, I worry that I was sold something entirely different. Could it be methylone, since I&#039;ve never even come into contact with that before? Or maybe my regent tests are too old? What&#039;s anyone&#039;s take on this?<br /><br />I&#039;d love some feedback.

				What is it, then do you think?<br />I&#039;ve never done meth before, and I&#039;ve only done cocaine once, so I have no other things to compare it to really.

				I don&#039;t have any experience actually testing products. I don&#039;t know how they work but I&#039;m guessing it is possible to get the wrong results.<br /><br />But the effects definitely make it seem bunk. It could just be cut with something and that&#039;s why there were only small effects but seemed to pass the look, smell and taste test.

				Gosh, I think I&#039;ll need to buy a different test, just to be sure.<br />Or go back to this guy and get on his back about it.

				MDVP Or Methylone..I believe those chemicals give the reaction you speak of.<br /><br />300mg of ANY kind of REAL MDMA, will floor most anyone. <br /><br />Its certainly not Meth, that kind of meth dose will have you fucking tweeking like you couldnt imagine.. youd get the meth mites under your skin. LOL

				Thanks guys, that does help a lot. I&#039;m going to grill this dude for giving me bath salts.

				you could get a mandelin test, to see if the orange is reacting with amphetamine. it sounds like it may be a mix of amphetamine and a bath salt type chem and cut... or it may just be a bath salt that is stepped on and the different reagents you used had different ratios of the chemicals used in them.<br /><br />sounds like with that dosage what you have is not pure for sure though.<br /><br />FYI i will be offering these reagents for very cheap and giving samples shortly.

				Hargenflargen, <br /><br />Without knowing which reagent tests you performed and a more detailed description of the progression of the color change that you observed there is absolutely no basis upon which anyone could offer you even a wild ass guess. There are alot of testing reagents out there, so it is impossible this point to make any guess whatsoever about the identity of the substance.<br /><br />Less is definitely more whenever your performing a reagent test, and a few tiny grains of the substance that is just big enough so that you know where to place the drop of reagent from 4 inches or so away is just the right amount. A little residue will actually give you much more information that a small little pebble.&nbsp; &nbsp;I take a clean clip from a Bic Pen, and simply rub it against the sample a few times until I see a little powder on it and then gently tap it onto a plate.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you try performing your tests again, and posting your observations for each reagent.<br /><br />We all have our first times doing something, however testing your drugs before ingesting them is the smartest thing you can ever do, so lets work at this until you are comfortable performing the reagent tests.
