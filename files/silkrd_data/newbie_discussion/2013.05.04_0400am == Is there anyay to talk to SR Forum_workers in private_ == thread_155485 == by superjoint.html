				Last week I got shut out of my site, total dumb ass move. Luckily i keep ALL documentation of my last SR wallet used (i dump that info later, once all is good). Any I got someone help me get back IN THIS MORNING, and get this my autistic cousin goes nutty and he reuin all the info i was given by the SR guy, after 48 hours of being wake and trying to fix this, i was more of a mess than she was..... I have extensive proof and i am not just fucking around, i probably have more proof than i need. The biggest dilemma here folks, is that I own someguy9191 a bit of coin on a purchase I received Monday. What with SR going so bat shit crazy, it has been very hard to pay him while locked out of my account. I want so bad to get him his coin, he is legit as fuck and desrves every cent of it. SO, my question is, is thee anyone from SF FORUM who is willing to wade through this muck with me so that i can pay the guy his coins and get some sleep? my autisic cousin gone, and i m straight as an aero, no drugs in my system, so i think we can work this out pretty easy if someone is wiling to try?&nbsp; Thank you in advance if there is anyone out there who fits this bill.....superjoint

				You need to get in touch with SR Support again and go through the same process as you did initially.&nbsp; No one on the forum end of things can do anything to help.

				Is there any link or text to get to the SR Forum from here right now? THe reason I asked is because I can&#039;t seem to open that part of the &quot;site&quot;. Thanks Scout.

				The forum?&nbsp; You&#039;re already posting in the forum ...<br /><br />If you&#039;re talking about the main SR marketplace, then, no, you can&#039;t access it right now because it is - for everyone - down.

				You need to leave this one alone for awhile.&nbsp; Those forum/SR guys are sleepless and killing themselves over the attack.&nbsp; Let them alone, worry about your order in a few days.<br /><br />Help them by laying a bit low.
