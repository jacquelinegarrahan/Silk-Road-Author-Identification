				I&#039;ve read a lot about natural cancer cures.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that turmeric can kill cancer cells and reduce a tumor size by 60 percent.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that bitter gourd does the same thing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that ginger does the same thing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that neem leaves do the same thing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that holy basil does the same thing.<br /><br />And then of course, the ULTIMATE CURE- cow urine. You may laugh, but cow urine is one of the key ingredients in many Ayurvedic medicines and is considered as very holy by the Vedas. Cow urine has also been scientifically found to have antiseptic properties.<br /><br />So, my idea is this. What if we all took fresh ginger, holy basil, neem leaves, turmeric, and bitter gourd every day? I believe that would prevent cancer from ever developing. And, if you drink cow urine (a tablespoon in the morning on an empty stomach and avoid eating for 2 hours afterwards), I think you could sit in the middle of Fukushima&#039;s melted down reactor and would probably never get cancer.<br /><br />Has anyone else read about natural cures for diseases? One thing&#039;s for sure. The modern medical establishment is nothing but a bunch of paid killers, who give you harmful and dangerous drugs that kill you slowly. Think about it. They make money off of you getting sick. Cancer is a MASSIVE INDUSTRY. You think the doctors want to talk about natural cures for cancer? No way, they would go out of business. It&#039;s all about money. Modern medical doctors are simply paid killers, murderers, being paid by the pharma drug establishment pimps.

				Cannabis.. surely you found that in your research? good documentary on the motherboard channel on youtube, its run by vice. check it out cannabis in colarado or something. Cannaboid receptors being stimulated fight back cancerous cells, its all a bit debatable but either way better than kemo. At the end of the day cannabis makes you happy, sleepy and hungry very important when dealing with cancer. Get oil or eat hemp seeds.

				It depends on so many aspects. Type and stage of cancer. The effect that a lowered immune system is having on the rest of the body.. Age. Diet etc.<br /><br />First and foremost, its about alkalizing the body :)

				No doubt that there is a massive cancer industry in place, but this doesn&#039;t mean that there isn&#039;t also a huge incentive for someone to create some sort of &quot;cure.&quot; Unless you are willing to believe that there are people out there with cures that are continually being killed or bought off, then the real answer is probably that finding a cure is just hard.<br /><br />Problem is, the very nature of cancer itself means that a cure is very difficult to create, if even possible. Cancer is unregulated cell growth. Obviously, you can&#039;t stop cell division (or you&#039;d die), so how do you prevent only the cancer cells from growing?<br /><br />It&#039;s common to point at some simpler remedies as being successful, but that should be heavily scrutinized. Folk remedies are everywhere, and let&#039;s be honest - they are typically just bunk.

				wonder what cow urine actually tastes like&nbsp; after drinking some first thing in the morning you may not want to eat anything for a while anyway&nbsp; I hear peach stones (laetrile) is supposed to be good too&nbsp; and raw food diets&nbsp; It may be all about keeping a healthy immune system as apparently cancer cells occur frequently and our immune systems usually get them before they get out of hand

Not one of these people is alive because of alternative medicine.<br /><br />You mention many plants and herbs that are used to PREVENT cancer -but not CURE cancer. So if you have cancer, your best bet is chemotherapy and the ilk. Smoke some weed if it helps, but don&#039;t substitute cow urine for radiation.
