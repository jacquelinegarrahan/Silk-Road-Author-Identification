				Hy guys <br />i made 2 orders from 2 different vendors ,2 different country`s ( NL &amp; Germany), packages were processed next day ..but after 3 weeks i got nothing..not even love letter from customs .. 3 weeks for an EU-EU order is way too much so i don`t think i`ll receive any of the 2 .. i m wondering if i am the only unlucky guy ! <br />BTW, one vendor is claiming that Postal service workers are stealing , but is hard to belive this sh*t ! <br /><br />Any opinions ? or advice ?

				don t know what to believe .. he is just claiming that workers from PO are opening letters ... if his stealth was so bad the letter should not leave his country.. but i don`t think is about stealth cuz bouth of them are top vendors

				lmao im sure dutchmagic didnt went rogue, where did u read that? He always stands at 99.9% and had 5.0 when the change came in and all of the sudden had 4.7 overnight without explanation. I already had two orders coming in from him after all the fuss. The only 1/5 he gets are people that moan that his 2$ hash isnt as good as the 150$ concentrate they usually smoke...<br /><br />Anyway the problem is probably that u ordered the same time? Maybe postmen get suspected by 2 letters from 2 different countrys. Some mod here said its bad to order more than one package at a time. I understand why that could be. Anyway i even had 4 packages from different countrys came in at one day. Guess it depends on the postmen or luck. I wouldnt blame the sellers.<br /><br />

				talk to the seller and see if they would send some test letters to see if they arrive. get them to put something like flour in a vacuum pack just to see if they arrive. if he could send about 5 and none turn up then you know its the mail. if it is your postman then he will soon work out you&#039;re on to him and might stop or just get fed up risking stealing your mail just for flour.<br /><br />or try sending envelopes to yourself containing a royal mail headed letter stating that it is one of a series of test deliveries and that the receiver should call the post office to let them know it has arrived and if there are any signs of tampering. something like that should shit the life out of your postman if he is stealing your mail as he will know how seriously they take mail theft. would work better if you could arrange one to be sent from holland looking like it could be a silk road letter.

				just off my head, word it something like this...<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; Dear Mr [insert your name]<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;//*THIS LINE IN BOLD AND CENTERED*\\&nbsp; &nbsp; ****Royal Mail Security Test Delivery**** <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In response to your complaint of suspected mail theft we will be sending a series of test letters to your address. This is the first of up to 8 letters, all letters will be similar to this but the outer packaging will vary. Please call our security team on [insert number of your local royal mail security dept here] so that we can confirm that this test letter arrived in tact. We take mail theft very seriously and are currently working to resolve this issue. in the meantime please don&#039;t hesitate to report any other suspected thefts on the above number. Alternatively you can contact us at http://www.royalmail.com/personal/help-and-support.<br /><br />Yours Faithfully,<br /><br />[insert name of the head of the security dept here]<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />...you&#039;ll have to google or call to find out about your local RM security dept details. print it off with a royal mail letter head and even attach a copy for the dutch vendor to a pm so he can send one to you. also don&#039;t forget to put the address and date in the top right corner, of course this needs to be your local RM sorting office and starting with &#039;security dept&#039;.<br /><br />see an example of a royal mail headed letter here //*CLEARNET*\\ <br /><br />http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/11/article-2216107-15743807000005DC-117_634x933.jpg

				I&#039;m sorry your order did not arrive, but there is nothing that I can do about that. Please understand that we are really too busy to start sending test letters with flour. <br /><br />We certainly shipped your order, everything that is ordered here is triple checked by three individuals. And no, we did not go &quot;rogue&quot;... We prefer to keep doing business here on SR. Let&#039;s not spread any unnecessary paranoia ok? I hope your order arrives soon.<br /><br />Best wishes<br />DM

				Hey man, I had an order from a very reputable German vendor take over 2.5 months to get from there to UK. Germany to UK seems to be a lottery when it comes to delivery times as other orders I&#039;ve made have taken just 4-5 days. It&#039;s a pisser but not much you can do.
