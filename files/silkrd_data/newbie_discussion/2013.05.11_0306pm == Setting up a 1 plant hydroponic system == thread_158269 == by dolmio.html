				hey everyone.....<br />weeds been my choice off drugs since i was 15, iv lived up and grown up around it and iv also grown it alot of times, the difference this time is i need to do it as stealthy as possible so that even the people living with me dont have a clue.....i have my own big shed with old grow rooms i can use i just need good lighting and silent air movement, so i need good fans for inlet and outlet of air....any suggestions? also i dont know anything about how choof grows under leds? i normaly yeild a Pound of 1 plant if grown well...would a led light do the job of yeilding 1 pound? if so what sort of LED what i be looking at?<br /><br /><br />thanks in advance....:)<br /><br /><br />cheers

				Grow tents. I had one 1mx1mx2m and had a 400W HPS Lamp running inside it. It was in my bedroom while I was still living with my mother years ago. I was getting about a Pound every 3-4 months and I didnt smoke it but everyone I sold it to said it was the best weed they&#039;d had in years. The tents block out the light from escaping pretty good . The have two exhaust outlets on one side and an inlet on the other. My lamp was inside a clear tube which atttached to ducting and a fan to pull the heat out the tent. You can also get carbon filters to filter out the smell when you have a pound of maturing bud inside a tent in your bedroom. I had good a flood and drain system with rockwool as growing medium. It takes some maintenance and you got pay attention but you learn as you go. I would recommend a larger tent than mine though and grow small indica plants. Short high yielding and quick to mature and you can turn over a pound every 3-4 months. Get 2 tents you will turnover even more often. It will cost a little set up but pays for itself in the first harvest if you do it right.

				Just to add Ive never tried LED but I asked the guy at the Hydro Shop about them and he said they are not that good for yield and growth. If you had a very limited space they might be a good option but if you want to grow a pound each few months stick to HPS. for silent fans use insulated ducting. They will trap much of the sound. I was sleeping in the same room my tent was in and you could hear anything outside my room with the door shut. Just try and go for the larger tent than mine was 1m x 1m x 2m. I had to keep tying the plants down cos in the 2 metres height you have to allow the height of both the plant and the lamp and the carbon filter and the growing trays. So your plants need to be small and dense to fit into a tent that small. Go for the maximum height and wider would be better too. The bigger the tent the easy it will be to maintain.<br />I love growing weed as a hobby. I dont even smoke it myself. I just love the plant. It should be legal and I say that as someone with no desire to smoke it at all.

				For a small setup, CFL bulbs are ideal.&nbsp; Nothing will beat a decent 400w hps, or even a 250w though.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen fair results with led, and if temperature is a concern in a small space then maybe an led panel would seem attractive, but in my opinion x2 CFLs would be better.<br /><br />Think about converting a wardrobe. Or buying a purpose built tent.<br />For small spaces &amp; stealth, you&#039;re gonna need a decent filter and fans. You may be able to get away with just a passive intake for one or two plants, but even a couple of PC fans would do the trick.<br /><br />

				1 plant is worth it, with tlc and a little know how, 1 plant can veg for more than a year before you flower it.&nbsp; It will really comes down how much light you have.&nbsp; <br /><br />You need to keep this from the people your living with?&nbsp; Hmm its not out of the question.&nbsp; Are we are talking about like a grow tent in your room? Somewhere the other people won&#039;t ever go right?<br /><br />LED are definitely your best bet, keeping an hps cool in a tent or enclosed space can be troublesome.&nbsp; LED&#039;s are getting cheaper but your still looking at spending 5x what you would for hps to get your yields.<br /><br />You can DIY LED&#039;s strips for a little cheaper but what kind of budget are we working with here?<br />

				If you live in the US it seems like 1 state after another are adopting medical cannabis laws or even straight out decriminalization of marijuana.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t think I would fear growing as much as I would have say 5 years ago.<br /><br />Although growing in a rented property is a little iffy, does it say in your lease the landlord can enter when they want? Normally it does.

				dude go simple and get a dwc (deep water culture) and a 250 hps (high pressure sodium bulb) or 2 HO(high output) florescents 2 ft/24w 120v 6500k and they usually use a small thin bulb like a T-12. and set it up when you can maximize light output, but having a sufficent nutrient program as well as making sure all the &quot;limiting factors&quot; are all good. message me if you need any other help or questions with set up or general stuff.
