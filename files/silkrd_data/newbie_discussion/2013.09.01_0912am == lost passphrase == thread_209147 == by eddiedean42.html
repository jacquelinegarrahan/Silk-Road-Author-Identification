				I had an account here under another name and I got locked up for a DUI. My original username had 7 or 8 months length of membership and 9 or 10 purchases of oz.&#039;s of green and other stuff. When I got out last month I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; log in under my original user name and couldn&#039;t remember my pass phrase. I know my username and my PIN number but I can&#039;t log in because it won&#039;t take my pass phrase so I had to create a new username and start over as a newbie. Also I had a little money left on that account not to mention the purchase history and length of membership. Is there any way for me to get my pass phrase changed so I can access my original account?

				Yeah that&#039;s what I figured. I remembered my user name and even my PIN number but got locked up for 4 months and when I typed in my name and then it wouldn&#039;t let me log in. It just sucks because I&#039;ve been a member since March and have bought several O&#039;s of green and some other stuff, pills and dope and I had a perfect record. Damn that sucks because I have to start over. I was also wondering it it wouldn&#039;t let me own because I couldn&#039;t get to a computer for 4 months because I was positive I was using my original pass phrase but no entry. I guess their is no use trying to log in using my old username and just keep trying to get the pass phrase right. Oh well thanks anyway and if anybody has any other suggestions I could try please let me know. &lt;eddiedean42&gt;<br />
