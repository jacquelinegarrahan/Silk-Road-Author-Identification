If Law Enforcement somewhere actually had a vendor account they might cross-check an order name against their registry and hope they get lucky, but the act of laundering Bitcoin in itself would be on such a small scale it would be an enormous waste of time even if they catch someone red-handed (unless you mean they might get a warrant for the address with that basis alone searching for drugs, which won&#039;t happen - yet atleast).<br /><br />Now granted police don&#039;t act on logic or what&#039;s necessarily best for society, but as far as I&#039;m aware there has not been a single case with proof there has been a Law Enforcement Vendor on Silk Road. I personally think this is due to the simple fact there&#039;s a vendor fee. For them to actually register a real vendor account they would have to go through a lot of bureaucratic procedures which probably are on par with if they were to sell real drugs to someone, might happen in hardcore cases but no vendor on Silk Road is big enough to warrant this.<br /><br />Another aspect is I think people overestimate Law Enforcement to a high degree, they work best with systems they&#039;ve known for a very long time and are very slow to adapt to technological advances. When was the last time anyone heard police cracking a PGP identity, or any kind of encryption for that matter?

				I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s bad idea to &quot;sell&quot; shipping supplies.&nbsp; I just saying that you would have to be a real idiot to &quot;purchase&quot; them via the SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see listings for small baggies, mylar, and other shipping supplies.&nbsp; By &quot;purchasing&quot; these supplies via the SR, you are revealing your physical address to the vendor supplying them.<br /><br />By doing this your are breaking the #1 rule as a vendor in my book:&nbsp; Never reveal your identity to anyone!

				This seems like an obvious rule to me, but you&#039;ve raised a point that I was going to make in a product sample review I really need to get round to writing (I&#039;m doing it tonight!!)<br /><br />The sample I received came from Germany and, as well as obviously my address, it also had a full SENDERS NAME AND ADDRESS! This was also printed on a piece of paper inside the package! <br /><br />I was planning to make a point of this in the review, explaining to the new vendor that this is obviously a big mistake, but since then I&#039;ve received other packages from the E.U. that also have return/senders addresses on...<br /><br />Is this a postage requirement in some countries?? <br /><br />Do these vendors use a fake name and address?? Even if they do, I would highly recommend to them NOT to do so if it&#039;s an option! <br /><br />Anyone have any info on this? Have you received packages with return addresses?!?<br /><br />As I said my sample review will be up later so you can see the full details ;)
