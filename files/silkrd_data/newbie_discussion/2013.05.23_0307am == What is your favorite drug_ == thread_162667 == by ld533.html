				Out of all the drugs you have taken, abused or tried, which one is your favorite?<br /><br />For me, it would hands down be MXE (and yes I have done a lot of K too). I would describe it as a deeper, more euphoric K.<br />From the first time I got it from SR, I aimed straight for the M-hole. My first M-hole was the best drug experience I&#039;ve ever had, it was so deep, soul-soothing. It resonated deep within my core and made me feel like I was part of something much bigger in this world.<br /><br />What about you guys?<br />Ps. This seems like a better way to get to 50, rather than spamming nonsense!

				Spamming is as spamming does....serves a purpose I guess. I prefer to think of them as dead threads.<br /><br />I love LSD, with plenty of weed to wash it down.&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Get all the preparation right (set + setting etc) and there is no better drug.

				It&#039;s a toss up between 2C-B and LSD for me. 2C-B is amazing, with intense visuals and a very trippy headspace. LSD is similarly trippy in the head, but less visual, but also longer lasting. I want to try higher doses of each of them, but only trip once a month and want to work up to that kind of dosage, so those will be a long time coming.

				LSD is fantastic, but heroin is very nice when I&#039;m hurting. I usually limit it to a couple times a month though.<br /><br />I freaking LOVED DXM when I tried it, but I would love to try MXE... I love dissociatives.

				I would love to try LSD :) It is quite expensive though. I have tried 25c and 25i and 5-meo-mipt. I probably will make an LSD purchase to experience it and maybe get another to mix with MXE (mixes great with psychedelics).<br />I never really got weed, whenever I smoke enough to get stoned I always get a rush of nausea and anxiety. Other times I&#039;ll just feel like a degenerate for smoking it, even if I&#039;m in a positive environment.<br />Once I had a fat joint shared with a friend (who is a seasoned smoker) and passed out while staggering to the toilet to throw up. Everything went green and uncomfortable and I had to go to the toilet and I passed out while walking and fell into his laundry basket, narrowly missing the sharp corner of the laundry sink (which would have killed me if I hit it).<br />I spent the rest of the night throwing up violently every 15 minutes feeling like I had gastro.<br /><br />Also, I agree ^<br />DXM was probably the second most enjoyable drug I&#039;ve tried.

				Definitely would have to go with lsd, iv had so many good experiences with it(a couple bad too but still enjoyed)<br />Lsd always made me feel very in tune with my mind and body. Made me able to read peoples demeanor easily to tell if Id genuinely enjoy even socializing with them, which was an awesome thing for my antisocial ass, in a way i always felt a part of a collective conscience on lsd even days after.<br />I didnt feel like nbome was at all comparative to lsd I fucking love lsd.<br /><br />And weed must say I love it maybe as much as lsd maybe even a little more cause of its synergistic property with every psychoactive under the sun<br />&nbsp;

				There&#039;s no easy answer. Especially since LSD purity is hard to establish. Ego death is an intensely personal experience, and the amount of LSD needed to cause it differs from person to person. You&#039;re essentially asking internet strangers how much LSD it would take to cause all of your identity to vanish, and more. It matters on your approach, the set and setting, more than the dosage. I think 500ug should easily be enough to hypothetically induce it in some people, if the circumstances were right.

				My favorite drug to use is weed, because it&#039;s pretty harmless and can be used quite frequently safely unlike most other drugs (Not saying other harder drugs can&#039;t be used responsibly).&nbsp; Plus I love the mindset weed puts me in.&nbsp; :)

				Most MXE is not as pure though. That was easily the best MXE I&#039;ve ever gotten, and he refused to give up his source for money (though I&#039;m sure I didn&#039;t offer enough).
