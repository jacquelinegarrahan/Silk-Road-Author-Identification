				Did you also read the ones who already got it???<br />I know how you feel i also bought here lots of times,<br /><br />But yes i am for real!<br />Keep watching the previous given feedback&#039;s..<br />And dont panic so fast...<br />Remember its not email, it takes time till it arrives..<br /><br />But i am sure the ones who are freaking out now will change their feedback soon.<br /><br />Think about this:<br />A Account costs about 500 dollar, some people already said that the product arrived,<br />so why should i scam people now when i have put money into it???????<br /><br />But i understand people freak out quick, especially here on SR.<br />I also been scammed before as a buyer.<br />But be patience before you start scaring people..<br /><br />Yes the picture is from pillreport.<br />That was safer and quicker, but if you want me to add some real pictures, no problem.<br />Will add them Friday evening.. you guys want me to add something in the picture to prove it&#039;s me?? (NO NOT MY FACE haha)<br /><br />btw, Yesterday i spoke to my supplier, he also has Ketamine, the price is low enough for me <br />to put it online 25% under the current prices..<br /><br />Just 3 left till the 30%&nbsp; openings sale ends! <br /><br />If you are afraid, <br />don&#039;t order and just wait a few days till people changed their feedback and u see <br />that Strike is Real and awesome!<br /><br />Strike.
