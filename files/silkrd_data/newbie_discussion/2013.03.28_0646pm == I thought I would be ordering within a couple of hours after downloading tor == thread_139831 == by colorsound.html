				Only thirteen posts to go, well, 12 after this one, then I will be able to reply to posts on other threads.<br /><br />I downloaded tor and I thought I would be ordering hash within a couple of hours after<br />I didn&#039;t know I would have to do some technical training like PGP, bitcoins etc.<br />Not looking forward to that bit, cos I am not that confident, and I am still afraid I will uncloak myself somehow.<br />

				Just do some reading about all those steps. Its all not as hard as you think it is. Each one is built to make things more secure too, so as long as you do it right, you&#039;ll be more cloaked, not less.

				By the time you have learned PGP, how to procure bitcoin safely(especially OTC), how not to annoy vendors etc: you will, I guarantee have higher self esteem, more patience, be considerably better at research and be enjoying safer, better drugs and an enlarged hippo-campus.<br /><br />You will also be sending a massive fuck you to the people who most deserve one.<br /><br />Oh, don&#039;t FE (finalize early) <br /><br />Respect goes a long way here in my short experience, and I&#039;ve never had any interaction with anyone that was other than decent.<br /><br />Just read, join PGP club, you&#039;ll be good to go before you know it!

				dl gpg4win and make sure to check gpa on the installation. then when dl, open gpa and set make your pgp key. then you just copy the vendor pgp and import it from clipboard. then check the vendor pgp and type your address. then click encrypt. then copy and paste that in your address box on your order.<br />btc, you need to set up an account with mtgox. but first make a tormail email account to set up your mtgox account with. after you make a mtgox account, go to bitinstant and make a deposit to walmart or cvs or other local location. use your real name bc this is not illegal in any way and a fake name to do something legal is just asking for problems. then it wil tell you to print out your deposit slip. take it to walmart and go to money center and pay them. they will send it to your mtgox account. if they ask, tell them you are paying a bill. your money will be in your mtgox account before you get home. then transfer it to an instawallet. remember to save your instawallet address and key. VERY IMPORTANT!!<br />i usually send it through a couple instawallets before i send it to my sr account. <br />hope this helps you out man. i think its accurate to the best of my memory right off hand.

				follow my instructions and you should be okay. if youre like me, then read up on the forums for a while before you order. i did for like two weeks.<br />oh, and this isnt really relevant but i wouldnt really tell anyone ab sr. i dont. only like two of my closest friends. i dont trust ppl enough and plus i dont really care to have sr knowledge in common with anyone except you guys. plus, you have a one up if some of your friends are looking for a certain product and cant find it. you have the upper hand and could profit from having the sr knowledge.

				The most unfortunate thing about you is not your ignorance, but your recklessness.<br /><br />I would advise you to discontinue connecting to the Silk Road for the time being. You need to learn a bit first. Not much, but a bit.<br /><br />Just so you know, there are certain things you need to configure in the TOR browser before you go ahead.<br />The default browser bundle leaves referals and geolocation in.

				Duckduckgo is pretty good, but I don&#039;t know how good.<br /><br />To answer an earlier question, it&#039;s not so much technical details as it is simple human errors. You can set up the most secure browser in the world, but still give away information by making some mistake. I was going to post some more detailed problems I had with the browser, but I&#039;m not confident enough to risk telling somebody else something that might not be 100% correct. I&#039;m learning too, I think it&#039;s best to take a policy that the less you know about something, the more careful you should be.

				DuckDuck go seems pretty good to me, Google it aint, just adjust your expectations, plus you&#039;ll get some decent rudimentary clearnet privacy tips from them, though you&#039;re never private there. I&#039;ve been using them for about six months.<br /><br />Do persevere and keep safe OP, by learning to keep safe , you find all manner of unexpected treats. Hone them skills boy/girl!

				Hah! I was in the same boat, except that I dreamed I&#039;d be receiving packages the day after I figured bitcoins out. Patience is a virtue, I guess, and the whole system works to keep the flakiest of the drug culture over in some other universe. It has been fun learning each step of the process, and I trust that before too long, I&#039;ll be a happy, experienced, veteren SR-camper. With red eyes.

				Yeah, this is a great thread, so much knowledge and truth. Been around on another acct in the house and started my own finally. Figuring it all out is good because as someone said earlier it keeps some out. But the smart ones get in and some of them aren&#039;t so good either. Be careful with what you say. If it is in anyway informative, PM someone don&#039;t post it here.<br />MtGox is good, so is BitInstant but it took my monies almost 12 hours to get in there though. I was very worried. SR is not a speedy set up, or it would be gone. For MTGox, you do have to reveal your info to get verified, or I did. I have MS so SR is a God Send. It reminds me or going to the coffee shops in Amsterdam. It really is so much safer then any other fashion, both for buyer and seller.
