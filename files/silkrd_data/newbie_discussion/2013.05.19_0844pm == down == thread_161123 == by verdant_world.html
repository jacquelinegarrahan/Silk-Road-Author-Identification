				Isn&#039;t there a simple clearnet site that you can just copy/paste the pgp info and then get information to copy/paste into another page on the same website where you can type in your sensitive info for the vendor? Does anyone know what this site is called and if its safe to use

				Yeah a friend used the road once I was watching him and he found a tutorial on clear net and one of the steps simplified PGP by allowing you to copy/paste the PGP info and then take the important characters to another page where you can then type in your information and re-encrypt it, it was so easy I couldn&#039;t understand why people thought pgp was hard but thinking back its probably not near as secure to do it this way.

				http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-3-making-an-order/ This site makes PGP all too easy but I wanted to ask some experienced or tech savvy members if this is an unsecure way to use PGP. this guide also says you don&#039;t need to use Tor for this part but wouldn&#039;t it make it safer to use tor anyways for this part if using this websites encyptor?

When browsing on an onion website, traffic is encrypted end-to-end so nobody can eavesdrop on your communications. Using PGP to encrypt your address is good in case SR&#039;s servers are compromised, which is why it&#039;s recommended, and it&#039;s pretty easy to use anyways. When you use a third party website, that website knows who you&#039;re communicating with and your address, which is NOT GOOD. <br />For example, the website would see the key belongs to &quot;Marcel Ketman - ketman@tormail.org&quot;, and linked with your address, they pretty much know what you&#039;re up to, and have your real identity thanks to your address.<br /><br />A good easy to use PGP software is gpg4usb.
