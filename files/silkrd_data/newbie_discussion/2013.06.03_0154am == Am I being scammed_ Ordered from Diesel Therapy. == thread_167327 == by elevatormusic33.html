				I placed an order last Tuesday with Diesel Therapy for some stamp bags. I paid for priority which nearly always is 2 days from all over the country, I think I had one package take 3.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve sent a few messages to him to see if he can track it. He then asks for my name, I tell him...then nothing. I ask again, he asks for my name and again nothing. Is he bullshitting me? First problem I&#039;ve had like this. I know these vendors are busy, but this is just bizarre.

				The only time I ordered from him, it took awhile to receive. Like a week and a half. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re being scammed, it just takes awhile for him to get to orders.
