				Just looking for reputable vendors with the best prices on ounces of the AAA, simple. Any that are known to include free samples of hash with that size order would be awesome.&nbsp; ;)

				For single ounces being on the maximum side of what he sells I&#039;d recommend Fast Forward 100% of the time.&nbsp; He has some of the dankest dro and indoor bud around and runs his whole business himself.&nbsp; He has great customer service and some amazing waxes, and bubble hashes from time to time.&nbsp; He also carries many other goodies if your into anything else.&nbsp; <br /><br />My second recommendation is RetinaBlast who sells everything from ounces to lbs and always has some great quality indoor and amazing AAA Greenhouse bud from the northwest<br /><br />Both of these vendors provide excellent stealth shipping but Fast Forward goes above and beyond for every client and his shipping methods are far better than anyone else I have seen on the road period.&nbsp; If I were you I&#039;d at least give them a look on SR and see what you think for yourself; I hope this helped!<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; also I am in the process of ordering from Hydroponics and will update how that goes afterwords!

				Check out La Fuente If your looking for the cheapest prices.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t ordered from him yet but he seems to have fairly mixed reviews (more good then bad) and the most amazing prices I have ever seen
