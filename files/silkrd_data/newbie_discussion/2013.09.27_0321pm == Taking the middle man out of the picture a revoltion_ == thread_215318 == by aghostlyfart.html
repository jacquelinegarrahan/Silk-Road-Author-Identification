				Hey again everyone, I&#039;m brand new to the SR and i must say i am AMAZED and that&#039;s to put it lightly. Instead of introducing all your friends and ignorant people to the SR and potentially harming the community and drawing un wanted attention to the SR i was thinking of cutting the middle man off the street and taking advantage of the loopholes in the mailing system. I wanted to know your opinions on this because i&#039;m working on my 50 posts, and I&#039;m really passionate about the war on drugs. I&#039;m a former H addict (clean for 3 months now :) ) and i just hate all these greedy people on the streets out here who will pinch you at every corner with everything from cut product, to over pricing shit down to the penny. I understand everyone needs some bread but why not share that bread? Too much bread makes one fat ;) So what I&#039;ve been considering lately, is all my friends in real life instead of blindly introducing them here I&#039;ve been explaining my system with as minimal details as possible. I want to give good vendors great business, and ultimately cut out the street middle man taking gross advantage of SR prices. By this i mean the people i know who want bulk product and who want to distribute themselves, i collect their cash get my own bitcoins and have the product sent to their house with an encrypted address. That keeps stupid people off the SR; the greedy; unethical street dealer out of business, and I&#039;m only making a small amount of profit to continue my endeavors. I consider myself a revolutionist and i was just curious as to what you experienced SRers thought.

				Such wise words yoda lol. Yeah those are some really good points and things to think about, although I&#039;m still not sure about how it could be traced back to me since the vendor would be the ones shipping the product, i never touch the package at any given point you know? I just accept the money and take the whole process of researching this new found discovery, selling my wisdom more or less. You&#039;re right though i can see how it can be a very bad idea, but maybe theres a way to go about it and make it beneficial for the whole community? There&#039;s alot of noobies out there that have easily found this place through google, and it concerns me that all these ignorant people are ordering without even doing research or learning how to simply encrypt addresses. I understand your concerns but is there ANYWAY to make this process legit? I mean i would be dealing with the bitcoins so i know how to make it pretty hard to trace, I&#039;m the one encrypting shit so in a sense its protecting the vendor from noobies. I think it could almost add another layer of anonymity in a way you know? By stopping this massive flood of people being introduced here. In order to trace it back to me, in the case of a CD they would have to go off of someones word and hunt me down. This would be an excruciating process for them seeming how i never touch the package? IDK just some things to think about you know? This is like willy wonka&#039;s gold ticket to me and i want to share the love, just not in a stupid fashion like most people do. It sucks paying full price on the street and IMO it&#039;s actually more dangerous buying shit off the street. I think youre way less likely to receive a CD than getting busted in real life as you have to drive to meet the people who are potentially being watched, and theres physical evidence of the transaction you know? They don&#039;t really have to get a warrant to bust someone on a street deal but i&#039;m sure its a long process to set up a CD with such small orders but who knows i&#039;m just a noobie to the kamel. Thanks for your comment by the way :) I love how friendly people are on the SR i feel a new sense of &quot;family&quot;.

				Perhaps this topic is best discussed elsewhere. I would really love some feedback though you guys, i literally can&#039;t think of anything wrong with the process. Most people go down because of bad karma you know? If you only wish to help the world, the world helps you but that&#039;s just my outlook on things.

				Maybe I misunderstood you a bit.<br /><br />So you want to purchase for your friends, if I understand correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp;And just have it delivered to them, right?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think that makes you untouchable LE wise... a conspiracy charge is pretty vast in it&#039;s reach.&nbsp; You still have to exchange cash and talk to them about what they want.&nbsp; And in your case, to make it worth while, you&#039;d have to be making non personal amount/bulk purchases... cause obviously personal amounts on SR aren&#039;t really too cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets say one of your customers gets CD&#039;d... they really haven&#039;t read all the stuff you have, and don&#039;t really understand their constitutional rights... or they just get scared when they see all the badges... they fold.&nbsp; They&#039;re going to have to tell LE how they gave you money, which you then had the drugs sent to them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this scenario protects you.&nbsp; I personally would just send everything to myself/my drops, then distribute accordingly.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Either way, you can be busted.<br /><br />I still think the less these people know about what you&#039;re doing, the better.&nbsp; And from another angle... if you send shit direct to these people, it&#039;s only a matter of time until they use google and cut you out of the equation all together.<br /><br />Just my two cents... you do what works for you though.&nbsp; Stay safe.<br /><br />

				What if some delivery never happen? They will come after you and you&#039;re gonna be responsible for the lost money.. What if its a CD? You are gonna be a snitch? <br /><br />Cutting the middle man by being the middle man? I think you should think of it twice and if the risk worth the hassle..

				Brilliant input. To answer your question yes yoda, and i wouldn&#039;t have to ever really even receive cash per say. These people i trust and i explain to them to NEVER sign for a package or go into the PO for a delivery. I would have them purchase money pak cards, and wire the codes to me and then i would place the order for them so they never truly interact with the vendor or me. I agree with what you said C, in a way i would be a middle man, but I&#039;m not out to fuck people over really not the greedy type. Again you&#039;re right yoda, it wouldn&#039;t be worth it for personal gain but really a couple of dollars here and there to help my friends out, and keep them off the street would be well worth it to me. I&#039;m just curious as how they could pin anything on me you know? I have the right to deny what anyone says about me and what kind of actual evidence could they place on me when people are just sending me money pak codes and then &quot;mysteriously&quot; receiving these awesome packages in the mail having no idea where they came from, not traced back to me.

				I don&#039;t mean anything bad for your friends but when shit goes wrong many people crack and say things that shouldn&#039;t be said.. Freedom is a big deal when threatened.&nbsp; You are the one who knows where the shit came from and its the worst position to be on a bust. A confiscated computer could tell a lot to LE and its very difficult to keep it clean, especially if you are not savvy enough.. <br /><br />I&#039;m not criticizing or anything, I&#039;m just expressing my thoughts that&#039;s all.

				No offense taken :) I welcome criticism it&#039;s the only way we can learn through others opinions. This isn&#039;t something I&#039;m doing, it&#039;s just something i REALLY want to do you know? You&#039;re right though alot more research has to be done, and hence why i started the topic. Very good point about conspiracy to distribution, that&#039;s probably one of the many things i didn&#039;t consider. <br /><br />C, you&#039;re also right about the &quot;missing&quot; package thing but that&#039;s the least of my concerns. The people i would do this for are my friends and know I&#039;m only trying to help them out.<br /><br />When i explain things i tend to REALLY explain things, so people would be putting their trust in me and not so much the other way around. I have been scammed far too many times, to fall for someones pathetic attempt at using me. <br /><br />At any rate i truly believe that if this topic is researched enough it COULD be used for the greater good of SR, I welcome the people that i would work with to eventually find out about it just not through me you know? Because that shows initiative those people would have to research what the hell i&#039;ve been doing which is great so we don&#039;t have these stupid people who make youtube videos about our community and don&#039;t explain things thoroughly IE not explaining to one how to encrypt an address which is EXTREMELY dangerous to the community buyers and vendors all around. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s wrong for me to want to share such a great thing with people &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility&quot; but can one be ashamed for having such optimistic views on the war on drugs, or wanting to get rid of these greedy people on SR pinching the fuck out of people on the streets? <br /><br />I have been making some small sales, but it almost feels more comfortable not ever seeing these customers face to face, or driving anywhere. I would much rather just have the product delivered to my customers, which isn&#039;t being sent from me you know? I want to make sales but i don&#039;t want to ever touch my product if that makes sense, and i&#039;m sure theres SOME way to do it Some sort of loophole out there.&nbsp;

				You&#039;re right i would be one of them, but I don&#039;t want to grossly take advantage of it you know? Again this isn&#039;t something I&#039;ve done yet just considering it because i move around alot, have friends all over the states. My cat received his first order, let&#039;s just say for safety&#039;s sake that this order only cost my cat around 55$, and my cat can make 1,000$ off of it on the streets if he sold it to other cats. That makes my cat feel really greedy wanting so much gross over pay taking advantage of the people i know. Also the people he know&#039;s and trusts are scattered around the states, and my cat doesn&#039;t really know too many people in his current state. My cat isn&#039;t comfortable meeting the people in person, and feels it would be MUCH safer to take advantage of the mailing system. My cat also would feel ten folds cheaper if the mail was never touched by his self persay (taking as many steps as he can to sever the ties between the SR and the other cats my cat knows and himself).

				GREAT idea yoda, seriously something i didn&#039;t consider will definitely do this. C, that&#039;s really wise of you and i understand you not wanting to be part of it you know? But if power is in the numbers, if we could safely teach people how to do this shit then we don&#039;t have to worry about SR having any problems you feel me? I can see where you get the feeling of not wanting to be part of peoples mistakes, but really in this sense my cat would just be forwarding orders. IMO it&#039;s alot less risky, slowly introducing a friend to it this method especially if you teach them to encrypt shit and the laws and what not, rather than just showing them this place and letting them roam as they please. What happens if LE catches him and he cracks, revealing you KNOW something he didn&#039;t. Also my cat&#039;s method would take SR out of the picture, there&#039;s new sites like SR popping up everyday and i cant help but feel like many of them are scams or LE&#039;s honey pot to catch people looking for places like SR. If they ever caught my cat, i just feel like it would take ALOT of work to fuck him over you know? No plan is full proof, not even SR is completely safe.
