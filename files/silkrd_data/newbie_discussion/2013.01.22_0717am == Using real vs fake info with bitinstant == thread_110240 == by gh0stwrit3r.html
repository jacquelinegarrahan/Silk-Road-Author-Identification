				Sorry I guess this is the only forum I can post in.&nbsp; I know there have been many threads on bitinstant.. but it seems that the rules keep changing.&nbsp; I&#039;m finally ready to make my first purchase, but I want to make it as anonymous as possible.&nbsp; Bitinstant asks for your real name and DOB.&nbsp; Then I hear that walmart asks for even more info like address, etc.&nbsp; Is it possible to use fake info?&nbsp; Do they verify any of the info?&nbsp; I was thinking of either walmart or CVS.&nbsp; Is one better than the other with the amount of info they ask for? I&#039;ve heard they don&#039;t ID at least.&nbsp; I was planning on using a tumbler like blockchain.&nbsp; But does that really anonymize you?&nbsp; Is there a better bitcoin source that bitinstant where they don&#039;t ask for as much info?&nbsp; I&#039;m located in the US if that matters.<br /><br />Also, how important is it to send to a different address?&nbsp; If all of these steps are made, they shouldn&#039;t be able to track the purchase to you anyway, right?&nbsp; I have a friend that has made 6 or 8 purchases, all shipped to his home and he&#039;s never had a problem.&nbsp; but I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s just been lucky.&nbsp; I can send it to a friends house, but I&#039;d rather not place him at risk if sending it to myself doesn&#039;t really add much of a chance of getting caught.

				Today the lady at walmart was like whats your address and I cant remember what I just wrote so I said its right there lmao. Then she says whats your phone number I said its right there... When you hand them the paper they look at it for a couple mins most of the time call someone cuz they don&#039;t know what the fuck they are doing. Then hand you a slip. Has name, address, phone number, city, state and lastly a signature. Then you hand back the slip a couple mins later they ask for cash. Then you must sign the receipt. All then after all of that they hand you everything back even the paper you first showed them. By this time the line is long and everyone is pissed that&#039;s standing behind you. This is my personal experience. Pretty much the same every time. No id is asked.

				I use fake info cause it&#039;s nobody&#039;s business but my own, but if you feel comfortable and don&#039;t give a fuck, go on and give &#039;em your real info. <br />&nbsp;Oh yeah, and I use fake info at Walmart, just as long as it matches the info you give to bitinstant, you are fine.

				I never use my own info, and I always use a dump e-mail. You can pick any name and address you wan to, I just went to the white pages and memorized a couple names/phones/ and addresses so that I can answer if they can&#039;t read my shitty hand writing.<br /><br />I also make sure and connect from a normal local IP address as a Tor address would look more suspicious.<br /><br />At the end of the day though your not doing anything illegal so fucke em&#039; but I like to be a little careful.

				Any thoughts on how well tumblers work?&nbsp; Supposedly it anonymizes your coins.. because coins are normally trackable.&nbsp; So if it does indeed anonymize, I&#039;d be less worried about using real info.

				I don&#039;t plan on ever using fake information. If you trip up and it is somehow discovered that you&#039;re using fake information (asked to show ID for cigarettes purchased at the same time), then it sure looks like you&#039;re doing something you&#039;re not supposed to be doing. I believe SR &quot;tumbles&quot; your bitcoins anyhow.

				if you are that paranoid just do it through the walmart moneygram way. they dont ask for your id, so you can use all fake info.

For example, if you were to go the Bitinstant-&gt;Walmart/Moneygram route and have your coins sent to a fresh instawallet address that was only accessed through tor, then I would say you can safely send your coins directly to SR. Even more so if you used fake info on the BTC purchase. The easiest way to make sure the coins you send to SR aren&#039;t tied to you in any way is to make sure you purchase your coins anonymously.

				At all the walmarts around me they simply have a blue moneygram express payment sheet to fill out which is so easy. If you just write a real persons name then you can actually remember the address and phone number because your account gets stored in their computer by the phone number. people working at walmart are trained not to give a fuck i&#039;m pretty sure, just make small talk and spice up their boring ass day :D

				Don&#039;t you need to register to send a normal moneygram?&nbsp; If so then my confusion of how this all works is warranted.&nbsp; But it does work!

				I&#039;ve always used my real info.&nbsp; As it&#039;s said above, buying bitcoins is not illegal, and unless you&#039;re buying a high volume of BTC, you&#039;re not gonna attract any attention buying a few here and there.
