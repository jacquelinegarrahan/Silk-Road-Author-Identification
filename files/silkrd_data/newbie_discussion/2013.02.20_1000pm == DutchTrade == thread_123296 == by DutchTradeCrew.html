Same as one of the big vendors that has been missing for a month... not to start any rumors or speculations.. just letting you experienced buyers know what to expect in the mail....<br /><br />i do not feel like taking pictures,feeling lazy, but if anyone wants to see the product, please reply and i will post a link for you..<br /><br />peace and love...<br /><br />

				DutchTrade is a new vendor but has proven to me to be a great one!<br />every message i sent he has replied within 24 hours (most of the time within 5 or 6 hours honestly)<br />The shipping time is excelent and descreate.<br />The product is nice, definatly quality stuff.<br />I have not a single complaint i could make against this vendor so far.<br /><br />If you are sketchy because of the number of transactions don&#039;t be!<br />He might have a new account but he knows what he is doing and is not a compleatly new vendor.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />@ Daydreamer and Martian313: The second package was sent approximately 5-7 days after the first package was sent. So you should receive the second package (with the right amount) by the end of this week or beginning of next week (considering that packages won&#039;t be processed by the post order company in weekends)<br /><br />Justashoutaway; thanks for the positive review! We appreciate it and are looking forward to do further business with you!<br /><br />Remember guys; our welcoming offer is still available, so order now and take advantage of the 10% extra!

				Been lurking this forum for a while now. Was about to buy from Interways last week until I heard about the product. Such a shame. Really excited about those prices. But now that DutchTrade is here things have gotten easier. <br />Just made an order with him for 10 grams. We&#039;ll see how it goes, I&#039;ll update when moved to In Transit and I&#039;ll test for quality.<br /><br />Hope DT is as good as its sounding to be.

				Another update here...<br /><br />My order has been marked shipped and DutchTrade asked for my public key to issue me the tracking number, it&#039;s the middle of the night over there so I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll reply promptly during normal hours.<br /><br />I resolved my resolution with HollyMolly and got a refund on my order (Ouch, ~1% refund rate --&gt; 34% refund rate), and decided to bet everything on DT (I&#039;m in a serious time crunch), so I have another order for 200 grams pending.<br /><br />So far, very happy!

Some said there was little euphoria and that clean molly feeling just wasn&#039;t there. I read someone said that there friend ate over 700mg&#039;s and barely felt as if he was rolling at all. They also described the prodct as damp with chunks of black/brown sandy like balls . <br />Here is interways review page you can check out peoples reviews on the batch he currently has : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120068.msg816424#msg816424<br />and here is a picture of what someone posted of the batch: http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8oj.jpg<br /><br />and lastly a direct quote from someone on that review page says --: as a side note to the quality, i gave a 1g sample to a friend, who does drugs almost every weekend (Keta, Coke and MDMA),<br />He took 0,7g (Yes 700mg) all at once, and he didn’t really feel any strong effects from it.<br />So i really hope, that interways, find a way to make this up to all the disappointing customers.

				Yes, the product does look exactly the same as the picture. The smaller bits that are gathered at the bottom of the baggie.<br />Waiting on a reship (due to weighing scale issues ).<br />I guess i will have to do an acetone wash on this batch....

In that picture, Interways product looks fire. This photo is probably a more worrisome picture of Interways batch: http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8og.jpg<br /><br />although DayDreamer in truth if you had a high quality camera (or any camera at all) to take a picture of it, or a molly-poppin&#039; friend to test it, that&#039;d be a lot better than rushing to an acetone test..Seems a bit extreme with no foundation for necessitating such a process.

				Received the second package from DutchTrade. Came in at 4.9gm, so it seems the scale might still have an issue..&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The product loooks very different than the 1st package. It is more like DA&#039;s product from a few months ago. Off white, smells strongly of liquorice, and is powdered with a few&nbsp; .1 - .2 crystals.<br /><br />I have taken a picture, but dunno where to upload it.

				I&#039;m just going to leave this here-it&#039;s my review on MDMA vendors thread about my latest transaction on SR from DutchTrade<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just received my 10G from DUTCHTRADE.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my review.<br /><br />VENDOR: DutchTrade<br /><br />PRODUCT: 10G MDMA Actual weight-12.23g<br /><br />COMMUNICATION 5/5 Very polite, fast responses-easy to understand and straight to the point. <br /><br />SHIPPING: 4/5 Ordered 2/15, shipped 2/18?, received 2/27 to upper midwest.&nbsp; However, I am giving a 4/5 due to the single layer food grade vacuum seal and the fact that before opened, I could hear the product rattling within the stealth.&nbsp; Once opened, I could smell the odor of the product through the sealed bag which means that a dog could easily pick up the scent within the package. <br /><br />STEALTH: 5/5 On point with Dutchaanbod and Interways, which has still provided me with a 100% success rate for orders coming out of Germany (I have now used PF, Dutchaanbod, Afterhour, Interways and Dutchtrade)<br /><br />PRODUCT ?/5&nbsp; HOLY SHIT!&nbsp; This shit looks and smells on point with Dutchaanbod, which if you had the opportunity to taste, you already know it&#039;s fire.&nbsp; I rolled on Monday, after 3 months of not doing so, on Interways mediocre shit but I know I&#039;ll be testing this product out within the next couple days.&nbsp; Bunch of chunks with crystal powder.<br /><br />Overall, he is a stand up vendor.&nbsp; I still have another 20g on the way from interways &#039;new batch&#039; so I&#039;ll post a review on here about that product when it comes, which will probably be next week.&nbsp; Either way, I think I have found my new bulk vendor with DutchTrade and am very pleased with the service that I received from him.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post a picture when I get around to it.&nbsp; Order from Dutch with confidence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On a personal note-I know for a fact we have a very high quality vendor here and so far since I&#039;ve been on the road (which will be a year in a couple weeks) I&#039;ve seen several vendors who WERE good quality vendors get fucked in the ass by scammers getting their shit and still getting refunds.&nbsp; I swear to god, I will be LIVID if this happens to DutchTrade.&nbsp; So PLEASE, DO NOT FUCK THIS GUY OVER!!!!!!!&nbsp; DON&#039;T RUIN A GOOD THING&nbsp; FOR ALL OF US AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FINALIZE YOUR ORDERS WHEN YOU RECEIVE THEM!<br /><br />Summer is coming up, which is festival season, and I was caught in a shit frenzy last year with Pf and really don&#039;t want this to happen again!<br /><br />I&#039;ll post a full trip report as soon as I can.

				Since the second batch does look better, i will not be getting the brown stuff tested.<br />In stead, i will do an acetone wash on it.

				I for one am excited, once my refund from OA comes in I will try and place an order. I would love to read more reviews on the product as well, but so far everyone that has it seems to be saying good things on the look/smell.

				@ DynamiteDrugs; Please advertise and promote your product on your own page and stop spamming ours!<br /><br />We would like to let you all know that we only sell light colored, top quality&nbsp; mdma! the darker one Daydreamer is talking about was a human mistake, unfortunately and won&#039;t happen again. <br />So please don&#039;t hesitate to order due to being unsure which product you will receive as we only have one top quality type of mdma to offer.<br />For all the customers who have placed an order up to now; thanks for your orders and please leave your reviews here.<br />We are looking forward to do business with you all!<br /><br />The DutchTrade Crew

				Hey Dutchtrade, can you comment on the guy in a feedback who said he had to sign for a package at the post office?<br /><br />Does selecting the track and trace option for international packages mean a signature is required?<br /><br />Looking to order but want to get that issue cleared up first.<br /><br />If anyone else that ordered to USA with track/trace or regular international shipping could comment on if you had to sign, that would help out as well. <br /><br />Also looking for some comments on STEALTH.

				@Deadra7 Thanks for the (more than) positive feedback, we really appreciate it!<br /><br />@ Ballstripped; as far as we know track&amp;trace doesn&#039;t need to be signed for upon arrival, as &quot;sign for receiving&quot; normally is another additional (more expensive) option.<br />We have sent many track&amp;trace packages so far and haven&#039;t heard anyone about signing upon arrival. The package is also small enough to fit into the mailbox. <br />

				Hi,<br /><br />i just received my sample of 500mg (i was expecting ~200).&nbsp; <br />I did not have to sign. Stealth is absolutely gorgeous (i thought hey, the stealth might be worth more than the actual product :D). The vacuum package it came in was very nice aswell. Not a single trace of smell. The product itself is a little bit crushed but looking at it with a loupe makes me comfortable its not impure.i guess its in that state due to increase stealth. It has some very clear, white little stones and some tan - just like u imagine it.<br />It was sent out at Monday and arrived Wednesday (today).<br /><br />Ill come back for a review on the quality after the weekend. <br />So far, im highly impressed by these guys. If they can keep up the work they provided me with there is no doubt they will be the next mdma superstars here on sr (if quality of the product fits the quality of the service - which i have no doubt it will)<br /><br />Thanks for picking me as a reviewer. At the time i asked him i had not even 20 posts and no purchases at all. Personally i wouldnt take a chance of such a newbe &#039;hit and run&#039; without leaving a feedback behind. But he did. Things like that separates the good from the very good sellers in my opinion.<br /><br />Have a wonderful day everyone

Seriously though, the question that you pose has a fair degree of validity to it, but consider the amount of time that would have to go into obtaining a list of addresses and names and somehow keeping tabs on all of them. LE has much bigger and readily fish to fry in a lot of cases. Sure they can keep watch on people going for personal use amounts or they could be going after that obvious meth-lab that has been watched for a couple months.For all LE may know also, these aren&#039;t reflective of the actual individuals who are ordering illicit product of any kind. Maybe some of us &quot;accidentally&quot; give an address that is the slightest bit off and drop by our neighbors&#039; homes when we see that tracking has shown our packages are delivered. Maybe all of us had no idea what was in that package and that we must be on some sick idea of a prank-themed television program.

				Received package for 10g today. Ordered on Saturday which means it took 3/4 working days from Germany to UK. I usually order molly from UK vendors but if DT keeps up the same standard of service he will have a loyal new customer. The delivery time was faster than some UK-to-UK vendors i&#039;ve tried. <br />The package had roughly 10% extra as promised (nice touch!) and had probably the best stealth i&#039;ve come across so far. Obviously it had to be seeing as it had to go through customs etc. but i was very impressed nonetheless. The product is light brown and smells great, there are still some rocks<br />intact but the majority of them have been crushed. Overall I would put DT up there with some of my favourite vendors already in terms of service. Hopefully hes here to stay!

				After all the positive feedback I&#039;ve been seeing about Dutch I&#039;ve decided to order 10g with the tracking option. I plan on updating when the package arrives. Does anyone know if tracking involves signing? When I messaged Dutch he mentioned there was no signing involved but there&#039;s some feedback that mentioned signing for a package.

				Who in the US has been using the Tracking option? I read earlier that somebody had to sign for a package from DutchTrade when using his Tracking and I really hope that is not the case. <br /><br />I involuntarily received the Tracking option and now I&#039;m a bit nervous/pissed that I might have to contemplate leaving it at the post office in that situation.

But this has me curious as well. Are you guys tracking through USPS?

				Track&amp;Trace = you have to sign for it<br />orders over 50g are getting track&amp;trace compulsory = scammers prevention <br />if you order 100g = it&#039;s split between 2 parcels and both parcels are send same day, from a same place, to your address( I would wait a week between parcels)

I ordered a small enough size that it will fit in my mailbox. I also have track and trace. I was under the assumption the mail main would just leave it in the box? I think signing is only for the larger orders that won&#039;t fit or just specific mailmen. I mean they all do it different to an extent from what I have read.

Track and Trace is REGISTERED MAIL and by USPS policy, requires a signature upon delivery/signing the slip they leave if you are not there. Few and far between you get postal workers who don&#039;t want to walk to your door or whatever so they leave it in the mailbox. This is the *exception*, not the rule. There really isn&#039;t much further discussion regarding that topic.<br /><br />Regardless, if you are getting 100+ grams of MDMA to your door, and they find out, pretty sure you are gonna get nailed whether you scribble your name or not. The BEST way to prevent a conviction is to: 1. Do NOT have drugs in your house when waiting for a delivery. A little bud is one thing, but seriously..No drugs. This is way more important than any signature you could ever sign. 2. Encrypt your electronic footprint.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know where the idea comes from that the police need a signature to secure any sort of conviction. That&#039;s just silly to even think about. I don&#039;t know specifics but considering how often people&#039;s doors get busted down incorrectly, I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be too hard to talk a judge into serving a warrant upon discovery of a quarter-pound of marijuana coming to your home. Let me reiterate..A single signature is NOT your last defense in preventing arrest, nor is it ANY defense.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=123296.msg898791#msg898791">Quote from: vektor the pirate on March 14, 2013, 02:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">phew!!!&nbsp; Looks like it will be delivered today.&nbsp; Tracking just updated to &quot;Arrival at unit&quot; This usually precedes the product being placed for delivery.

				Ordered 10g on 2/27, marked in transit 2/27.&nbsp; Communication with DT has been superb but the package hasn&#039;t arrived yet.<br /><br />I had a sample from another vendor in Germany that was sent out several days after DT&#039;s order and I have received it 3 days ago.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure it will turn out.&nbsp; I was just really surprised to see all the short shipping times from the reviews but it seems like my package got stock somewhere in the postal system.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update when it turns out. I asked DT to extend my due date in resolution but he hasn&#039;t responded yet...

If an exit node is comprised and LE see you&#039;re tracking something, they&#039;re going to look a little further into as WHY you&#039;re using something like TOR which is known for having drug mailing markets on it&#039;s network. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s different in your country; but for America, it is a BAD idea to track your shit with TOR. If you don&#039;t believe, really I don&#039;t care. Anyone else that&#039;s questioning this I suggest you go read the shipping forum in regards to this.<br /><br /><br />Stay safe everyone!

				After 8 days in transit, my 100 order from DT arrived. I had selected the track and trace shipping option, but never received my tracking code, but also didn&#039;t have to sign for it which leads me to believe that DT might have messed up the shipping option on my order, no big deal really if that is case. An extra 9.7 grams was included which was extremely nice of them. Product tested great on reagents and looks to be the same fantastic quality a lot of the other German vendors have been sending out. DT has earned my trust and seal of approval. Hopefully they put up 50 gram listings soon so I can order 150 on the next round.

				I understand the idea of taking as many precautions as possible, but I haven&#039;t seen a single bit of evidence from any source that using Tor to track your package will get it &quot;flagged.&quot;&nbsp; This is urban legend.<br /><br />USPS has tens of thousands of tracking numbers going into their system every day and MILLIONS of people tracking their packages at the same time.&nbsp; If you think they&#039;ve set up an entire system to weed out and identify specific tracking numbers based on Tor usage, you&#039;re fucking high.&nbsp; USPS barely has the resources to just maintain their basic services, and there&#039;s no fucking way they&#039;re wasting them on trying to differentiate contraband based on how the tracking is being accessed.&nbsp; It would require a massive manpower effort with huge numbers of false positives and plucking individual packages out of the system based on a very low percentage of success.&nbsp; They simply don&#039;t have the time or resources to even consider it, and that should be obvious if you think about it for half a second.<br /><br />Believe all the paranoid fantasies you want, but unless you can point to some actual proof, then you need to identify your advice as &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; rather than something based on reality.<br /><br />The only way your use of tracking could be used against you would be after the fact when you&#039;ve been already been caught via a different means of identification.&nbsp; And if that&#039;s the case, you&#039;re more than likely already fucked and the tracking would by no means be significant evidence one way or the other.

				what i can say is, it wouldnt be a problem for the gov to setup a program that flags certain ips. and i dont think many people check their tracking numbers through tor. The longer i think about the more i think it would be a very smart thing to do for them to go after those packages. It would certainly narrow down the search. I wouldnt wanna take a chance. If there is a small chance they could, why risk it?<br /><br />If u want to know it and look it up save - get a vpn + vic socks and ur all set. I would advice u guys to use that always. It can also make ur route to the tor network much better so u can surf much faster.

				My 10g order arrived to the west coast in 12 days. I must have been one of the first 100 because it came in heavy. A 12 day delivery bad at all. The stealth of the package is amazing. WAYYYYY better, 100 times better than any other package I&#039;ve received before. My testing kit ran out of juice not too long ago so I can&#039;t test it but just from visual, feel, and smell alone, I&#039;d have to say it has to be somewhat fire. My girl is planning on doing it sometime next week. Maybe my&nbsp; new test kit will come in then and I&#039;d definitely update you guys with a trip report.

				My tracking was stuck on &quot;Origin post is preparing for shipment&quot; for the first 10 days.&nbsp; On the 11th day it updated and showed US entry, and then on the 12th day was delivered.<br /><br />Dutch definitely needs to update his vendor and product pages to clarify that Track/Trace requires signature in the US.&nbsp; Not a big deal for me, but some people freak out about it.

				Put in my order for a few days ago with DutchTrade.<br /><br />I notice he posts on this review thread more then most vendors.&nbsp; Maybe it is just because he is new, but it is nice to see a vendor paying attention <br /><br />The only problem is the German post which is not his fault. Plus customs can hold onto things for a while.&nbsp; I have waited over 30 days including weekends for supplies from Europe to USA.&nbsp; But it sounds like DutchTrade is quicker then that.<br /><br /><br />

And the price is nothing to complain about either!!<br /><br />I just wonted to post a quick update about the quality of Dutchtrades Mdma, Im not posting a whole trip report because im lazy, but i do have experience with alot of different SR mdma vendors over the years .......<br /><br />&nbsp;The batch that I received looked brown/tan while sealed in the vacuum bag but after opening it and dosing out alot of capsules i notices its mostly white with a tan hue.. That being said it is still darker in color than any other mdma iv received off SR...&nbsp; I tested the mdma when it first arrived and it passed marquis nicely (only test i had available at the moment)... After giving out some average dosed (150mg) to close friends that have SR mdma experience i was a little worried that the quality wouldn&#039;t compare to previous vendors...<br /><br />SO this weekend i taste tested some myself...I only had one does of 150mg with 1000mg magnesium which is a good test point for me, and i will say that this is good strong mdma...&nbsp; <br />-Started feeling first effects in average time (20-30min)..<br />-The come-up was very strong, (had me laying down in front of my home stereo speaker while my eyes were shuttering all over), but the come-up didnt seem to last very long (sry i cant be&nbsp; &nbsp;more precise)...<br />-After the come-up i remember plateauing for a hour or so which was real nice but this is when i noticed a pretty strong jaw lock...It wasnt the worst iv had but it was pretty strong for only one dose...I also was having a hard time reading my phone or watching tv because my eyes were outta focus/shuttering..<br />-The ride down was smooth but had a small speedy/tweaky feeling to it...After a xanxa sleep was no issue..<br />- The next day i felt fine but i contribute that to only taking one dose and not redosing my serotonin away like iv been know to do...<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is mdma and is very good mdma for the price..I felt it lacked in the empathy department and was a little speedier than iv grown accustom to lately, but would be good in a concert/club setting... I will be placing another order as soon as these kids get off spring break...lol...<br /><br />2TheHaters:<br />It may sound like im trying to down grade DT&#039;s molly and this is not the case...

				Hey guys. So I put in order in for 10g on March 7th. Got marked in transit March 8th with Track and Confirm. My tracking has updated to show that it has gone through a sorting facility in Germany (3/14). I&#039;m going to assume that because of the insane shipping times my package will be arriving this week or early next week! Going to keep my fingers crossed.

In comparison, orders from germany would earlier take over 20 days.<br /><br />Quality : I have tasted a tiny crystal, to confirm the bitter taste of molly. very Faint smell of safrole.. Lot of big rocks.. One weighed in at 0.57 gm alone!<br />Others ranged from 450mg to 240 mg.<br /><br />Lots of rocks, some powder and gravel.some of the bigger rocks have a greyish tone to them. <br />I will try to put pictures of the rocks in a few hours, situation permitting.<br /><br />All in all, dealing with this vendor has been nothing but a pleasurable experience.<br />highly(no pun intended) recommended..<br />

				With much disappointment, I find myself finally joining the forums to post about a less than good experience.<br /><br />My delivery strategy relies on not having to sign for a package. DT&#039;s profile explicitly stated that with the quantity I was ordering, no signature would be required. I&#039;m also EU, so the problems that the Americans posting in this thread have had about signing for being added on shouldn&#039;t apply. The parcel eventually came, and the delivery man was not the regular one, and he was asking for a signature in the name sent to. This set off alarm bells, and I said that the recipient didn&#039;t live there any more. However, reading the thread, I&#039;m now thinking that maybe this wasn&#039;t a controlled delivery, and that DT actually did send via registered postage. So I have now potentially rejected a normal delivery, on the basis of DT&#039;s shipping not being as advertised.<br /><br />What should I do? I feel a little hard done-by taking a hit on this, I would expect a vendor to follow their advertised policy. In addition I have tried to contact them, the message has been read for quite a while but there hasn&#039;t been any reply. I feel it&#039;s unfair that I might have to choose between the two bad options of either finalising payment and receiving nothing, to protect my buyer statistics, or possibly accepting a 50% refund, which also doesn&#039;t look too great for me.<br /><br />I&#039;m posting to ask for advice on how to proceed, maybe prompt DT to respond to me (I&#039;ve since filed a request to extend auto-finalization in the hope that they resend the package to me), but also just to make other buyers aware that DT don&#039;t seem to be following their advertised policy, and to take that into account when considering purchasing.<br /><br />Until now I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with other vendors on Silk Road, it&#039;s quite disheartening to be coming to the forums for the first time with this!

				Everyone chill out on the skepticism.<br /><br />A) The tracking never worked for me, even after I picked my package up from the post office. So don&#039;t get paranoid about the tracking.<br />B) Shipping from this location can take some time. His stealth is pretty damn good, so these packages aren&#039;t likely to get discovered at all.<br /><br />Just give it some time like we all end up doing anyways.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------UPDATE---------<br /><br />A friend of mine has some of the mdma with him at a party and the people there are reporting nothing but great things about the quality. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if any of these people have experience with SR mdma, but I definitely do so I&#039;ll be back with a roll report within a week.

				I sold a gram to a friend yesterday. He and several other friends divided the bag into either 5 or 6 piles and ingested it. (So assuming equal divisions, we&#039;re talking either 166mg or 200 mg).<br />Maybe an hour later I get a text saying something along the lines of &quot;Holy shit this stuff is amazing.&quot;<br /><br />This friend has had stuff that I tested to be very potent before so he knows what he&#039;s talking about.

				Got my order today and all I can say is WOW!&nbsp; 33.75 grams, almost all rocks, most of which are in the .3-.8 range, up to about 1.5g.&nbsp; Straight to black with the Mecke test, plus a little fizzle and a wisp of smoke!&nbsp; Stealth is sufficient.&nbsp; Double vac sealed and concealed in a manner similar to that of vendors who had impeccable success rates for delivery.&nbsp; And I think the slight difference might actual add a little to this tested method.&nbsp; Just under two weeks from hitting the order button until delivery to the western US.&nbsp; From a quick glance it looks like shipping times might be slowing down a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to have read through the last few pages of forums just to see what the status of all that really is.&nbsp; If the posts are as I expect them to be (anxious customers biting their nails together for 23.75 between deliveries, which I TOTALLY understand), I&#039;ll be placing another order tomorrow.<br /><br />I personally can&#039;t test it for at least a couple of weeks.&nbsp; But I should have taste tests from trustworthy friends no later than the weekend and will report back with results.&nbsp; THANK YOU DUTCHTRADE.&nbsp;

Me and the roommate couldn&#039;t wait for the others so here&#039;s my mid-trip report!<br />My only time frame is thanks to the stopwatch app on my phone I started when I dosed.<br /><br />My friend, we&#039;ll call him Tricky Dick, and I each took similar doses. Me, 120mg, and&nbsp; he 100mg. I mixed mine in with about 8oz (America haha) water and Tricky Dick lined it up and snorted it. The reason he dosed nasally was because in our previous experience snorting would just things rolling faster. So when I took my water I expected to be lagging behind my friend for at least 30 minutes. That was hardly the case, where I could tell he was getting effect within 10 minutes, he claims 15 minutes was when it legitimately commenced. After smoking a bowl I arose to grab something and once I moved, on 15 minutes, I noticed that..glow in the back of your throat/near the spinal cord. I&#039;ve never tried to articulate the sensation but it was only up from there. From there, Tricky Dick and I have been on the same pace 2 hours into it. The first wave of roll was so, so, so sweet. Reality intruded a bit when we made a trip to the store for a vicks vapo-stick and when we returned I noticed a distinct sense of increased, lucidity, my shutter vision had chilled THE FUCK OUT, and I consciously made another mark at 1 hour 10 minutes, but fuck five minutes later I got goin again! Here we are 2 hours 22 min into the roll and I&#039;m still floating above clouds. We&#039;ll probably re-dose relatively soon buut so far, fucking magnificent. I&#039;m only sad that SR is still down for maintenance so I can&#039;t finalize soon enough! <br /><br />Dutch, I love you man, woman, you fucking guys!<br /><br />And to the rest of you:<br />ORDER! ORDER! ORDER!<br />But most of all, though I may be new to the SR, I&#039;ve heard about how good vendors get fucked and scammed, thus making them themselves shady selective scammers, and in the end no one gets fucked but us. So please, respect, cherish, and nurture DutchTrade.<br />Now that&#039;s the molly talking..

				Order shipped early Friday (10 days ago) and I have a feeling it will be here tomorrow or the next day. Usually German post takes this long to get to where I am anyways (or a little longer). On another note...<br /><br />I am really psyched about this vendor. Prices were unreal upon launch, 212 for 10gs which I pulled the trigger on 3 times at once. Looks like he bumped up his prices but there still about 50 less than anyone else. <br /><br />It looks like if this order comes through ill be ordering a lot more until someone can even start to compare to this vendors supposed quality and price. <br /><br />Looking forward to having a lot of extra income this summer, and a lot of happy friends.

I am super stoked to hear this! I love when vendors really have their customer service together. A lot of times their actual vending is so good that when something does go wrong they don&#039;t pay much attention to it since everything else is going great... Not the case here though!<br /><br />Also, if you don&#039;t get it by your birthday keep in mind MollyExpress can get a G to you in two days domestic but its pricier. Not trying to steal DT business but mollyexpress has the domestic shit down!

				Hey all. Just a quick update on our dealings so far w/ dutch. we&#039;ll make a proper write-up in a couple days. Placed a test order for 10 grams in the A.M., was shipped same day. Arrived 6 days later in wonderful stealth, and overweight as promised. Reaction to the three wise-men was absolutely beautiful, with great reports from testers. Ordered 100 grams with track and trace, received tracking number 16! hours later. <br /><br />TL;DR Stealth, communication, speed, and most importantly, product, are all the best experience we&#039;ve had to date. We will update when the 100 pack arrives.

				Just wanted to chime in with my experience so far with DT.&nbsp; I received my 10g order in roughly 2 weeks, packaging is on point with a few other vendors I&#039;ve used on the Road.&nbsp; No doubts that your packages will come.&nbsp; Once I cut into the package I instantly got a whiff of that nice molly smell.&nbsp; Product came with about 50/50 powder and crystal chunks.&nbsp; The only test I have right now is a small (probably 50mg) bump mixed with some Charlie, but that had me feeling great for about 3 hours.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure everyone is going to love this stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just put in another order for 10g, hoping it gets here for Coachella!&nbsp; <br /><br />Recommend DT 100%

				Order shipped Friday march 15. Looks like it would be morning in Amsterdam when shipped.&nbsp; So let&#039;s assume nothing happened until that Monday the 18th. As of April 2 still waiting on package to USA.&nbsp; But looks like I am still in the shipping time frame.<br /><br />Vendor looks legit, and it has taken 3-4 weeks in the past when I used a vendor from this part of the world. <br /><br />Can anyone comment on signatures?&nbsp; I did not select track and trace option but my order is for 30g.&nbsp; Will it be left at my door?&nbsp; I have a small mail box, maybe a bit smaller then the average US box.<br /><br />It will scare the shit out of me to have to sign for it.&nbsp; Could be a controlled delivery.

If the mdma is tripple vaccuum sealed it should be good for weeks. I will say though that when I tested the MBB literally the dog never smelled even two months later.<br />I used the 3m 2700 bag for that.<br />I will say if your order has been in transit for 2 weeks or more get that tin foil hat on.

				Re-posting as a follow-up to my pack being received.<br /><br />COMMUNICATION:<br />Not much needed, but vendor answered my questions in a timely manner.<br /><br />TIME:<br />Took total of 17 days to the Land of Liberty, vendor marked in-transit on the correct day, according to the postage on the package. Did NOT require a signature with the &quot;Worldwide&quot; option. I believe the &quot;Track &amp; Trace&quot; method requires a signature.<br /><br />WEIGHT:<br />Ordered 20g + 10%, received 21.91g, which is a great fucking deal for how much I paid! <br /><br />PRODUCT:<br />Product is about 60% chunks/rocks, 40% powder, with a few large rocks here and there. Has a clear/white consistency with a few darker patches and random off-color chunks. <br /><br />TEST:<br />Don&#039;t have a Marquis/Mecke, but taste tested a little bit and its very bitter! Delightfully disgusting, just how good MDMA should be&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />I&#039;m going to be THAT guy who bitches about the packaging. I really think this method is over-used, it is nearly identical to Dutchaanbod&#039;s and ST&#039;s method, and could be improved by using MBB/Mylar bags and adding more layers. Nevertheless, it made it through and I can&#039;t claim it was seized for lack of protection.<br /><br />COMMENTS:<br />DT is a great vendor, he actually ships when marked in-transit, and the product looks fire. Shipping was a little slow, but it made it! My only advice would be to personalize/add to the packaging a little bit. One of the best vendor&#039;s I&#039;ve ever dealt with, highly recommend!<br />

				So i picked up my order from the post office yesterday after receiving a note saying that the postman missed me and to pick it up the following day. Don&#039;t pick track and trace if shipping to usa. You WILL have to sign for it and it doesn&#039;t even work. The status of my order never updated from when it was leaving germany to when it was at my door step. It was 3 weeks to the date from when i put in my order to the day i picked it up(shipped to west coast usa). I ordered 10g and it weighed in at 10.85 and it smells on point! Product is light tan color and turns a grey/white color when crushed to powder. It was about 60% rocks/small crystals with the heaviest at .5. The packaging was okay and it made it over just fine but like people have been saying it is not in a mbb or anything like that. Just plain old vacuum seal. Its not just thrown in a box though but it could be upgraded a little. Not trying to put DT down at all though cause it did make it over just fine and would not be worried to order again. I haven&#039;t had the chance to test the product yet but i have no doubt that this is fire.

				Received order from DT :<br /><br />TIME: It&#039;s not good to be specific but I&#039;d say it was good (aprox 1 week to EU). Just order well in advance if anything. Tracks don&#039;t really work, expected better service from such a country but w/e.<br /><br />WEIGHT: overweight by 10%. For a first order I can only applause.<br /><br />PRODUCT: mmm that good smell of fresh md... some big crystals, some smaller ones and some powder. Pretty standard. By the looks and smell I don&#039;t even have to try it to know it is bomb. Clear/white crystals is what you should be looking for. Will be back for trip report.<br /><br />PACKAGING: good, very pro. Ok for EU and small orders. But PLEASE USE MBB DT!<br /><br />COMMENTS: Awesome vendor. Will be extremely successful if continues like this. No FE for 1st order on SR. This is real business. Only thing would be use of MBB.<br /><br />PEACE and thanks DT

				Just received my second order from Dutch and I have to say that he&#039;s a great vendor. The only concern I have is the packaging. Upon inspection, I could hear the rocks rattling around inside the package. It was only vacuum sealed a single time and the bag actually had some holes in it due to the friction created from the crystals. In fact, due to this, some of the powder had leaked out inside the packaging. I could actually smell it upon tearing open the package. I really like using this vendor a lot but if a sniffer dog took a whiff of this package, I believe it would have easily been discovered.<br /><br />Dutch, could you please at the very least double or triple seal your bags so there is no leaking. Or in lieu of this, please use the MBBs in addition to a single vacuum seal... I really think this would be the best option and if you did it I think hands down you would be the best Dutch vendor here on the road.<br /><br />Thanks though for an otherwise perfect transaction.

				No, you will not have to sign for the package if you didn&#039;t choose track and trace. My previous purchase with DT came in a package small enough to fit in any letterbox. The mailman should just drop it off.&nbsp; Just like slirp mentioned, don&#039;t sign for any out-of-the-ordinary package unless you know it&#039;s safe to do so, such as a package from Amazon that you know you placed an order for.

				Everyone can take this for what its worth. I was not even going to post this soon but I have MUCH respect for SR and the community. Obviously this is a burner account, I didn&#039;t feel comfortable posting this under my s/n despite tor and all.&nbsp; I have been with the community for a good while and I can say this is my first intercept. Now, you might say I&#039;m coming on here to support or down a certain vendor. No thank you. I would have much rather had my goods than post this. This is all I can give you for now. I ordered a decent bit. Not as crazy as some and not as little as most. Other packs have already arrived while waiting on this from Dutch. This is what I&#039;m 99% sure of. The pack has been intercepted but thanks to the wise words of the community I&#039;m fine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are very tricky and will try whatever to get you to admit to anything that might give them a direction to go. Don&#039;t give them that. <br />And to a word on stealth. In my time here, I&#039;ve seen some things get through customs that truly shouldn&#039;t. I truly believe &quot;the powers that be&quot; are getting a bit better. There are vendors on here that provide a level of stealth that truly couldn&#039;t be topped. If you have been around enough you know. This is the level that all vendors should strive for. I feel for now I have milked the road a fair bit&nbsp; and it&#039;s time to lay back a bit and enjoy my drugs. Stay safe my friends.

				Very few of these packages with &quot;awesome stealth&quot; have a chance through xray and customs is going to xray before they open a package.&nbsp; It is also easy to set a MDMA trained dog off with MDMA.&nbsp; This plastic crap that vendors use (often with residue on the outside at that) is worthless.

				Someone decided to give a burner account a neg....funny.<br /><br />And yes xrays can see &quot;through&quot; things but can only tell differences. Take ten sheets of paper put together in a&nbsp; manilla shipping folder. If the pack is xrayed laying flat it will show only the sheet of paper providing they are all even and planced on top of one another.<br />Cut out a star now, place it in the pack. It gets xrayed and you will see the original papers, plus the new star you cut out. Now take a flat sheet of lsd....place between said papers. Providing its the same size and relative thickness, it will not be picked up.&nbsp; Another way of looking at this. Say you&#039;re shiping balls of any size, if you throw rocks of mdma in there, the xray will see the outline of the ball plus the rocks. Now, if you grind the shit out of the product, pack tightly in the ball, then ship. When scanned it looks like a solid object with no variences. I know these arent the best examples but you hopefully get the point. <br />Neg away!

				This was my second purchase from DT for 10g&#039;s. <br /><br />Shipping: 15 days from when it was shipped to the West Coast. I placed the order before they took off to make their stealth better so no MBB. The packaging it came in is top notch though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Product: As they promised, it did arrive heavy at bout .8 grams. In rock form, the crystals looked a lot darker than the first package I recieved from 1 month ago. So, I&#039;m guessing this was a new batch. As for quality, this blew me and my people away. A point had some of the experienced users rolling face all night. I personally took .2 myself and had a wonderful time.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I came on today to place another order but SR was down. I will definitely be getting my MDMA from DT from now on. His product is worth it. I highly recommend it.

				Id just like to add that DT has always answered my questions within a day and he hasn&#039;t given just single line responses.&nbsp; He responds with full sentences and genuinely tries to answer your questions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in contact with him since before I placed my order and his communication level has not decreased AT ALL since I&#039;ve queried him concerning this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a few other vendors who would completely ignore my questions once I&#039;d ordered and I&#039;m glad to see that DT is a better and more professional vendor than that. :)

None of his orders were getting through.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if DT will offer a reship even if this is figured out.&nbsp; Especially with the bitcoin crash they may have lost allot of money and they have plenty of satisfied customers without us 15th people. <br /><br />DT is a good vendor, he still got a 5/5 from me.

				Well obviously other orders are getting through, so his packaging isn&#039;t compromised, as you put it.&nbsp; However, SuperTrips sent out packs the same for over a year without them &#039;catching on to his packaging&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the feds have ordered from DutchTrade to see how he packs.&nbsp; So that&#039;s kind of a moot point..<br /><br />If they don&#039;t show up, it&#039;s obviously a problem on his end.&nbsp; Why WOULDN&#039;T he be obligated to fix the problem on his end?&nbsp; I know he&#039;s got a TON of happy customers, but a shrewd business person doesn&#039;t disregard a couple slighted customers because it&#039;s easy.&nbsp; Especially since it&#039;s only a couple people(and my order wasn&#039;t very big) it would be easy to reship to satisfy them and ensure a return customer.&nbsp; This will be my first order that hasn&#039;t shown up on the first ship and if he doesn&#039;t make it right I&#039;ll be very upset and make a large sized deal about it.<br /><br />What exactly qualifies him to be a good vendor from my perspective? If he fixes it I&#039;d say he&#039;s a good vendor, having done his job, and will receive a 5/5.&nbsp; If people give him a 5/5 based on SOMEONE ELSE&#039;s experience, what value does the rating system have?

				I received my package to the eastern US 14 days after I placed the order. Like others have mentioned before, stealth could have been a little better, but overall it was ok and it got here. That&#039;s the most important part. I had to laugh when I opened it too. Weight was 1.2 g over what I ordered, and it came with another little bonus as well ;)<br /><br />No communication was required during the process. Everything went smoothly.<br /><br />Product looks like meth/gravel, but has that terrible terrible mdma taste which means it&#039;s great. I will be sampling it Saturday night so I will pop back in here and leave a more detailed product review on Sunday. <br /><br />Will def order from DT again, especially considering he is improving his stealth.

				1 of 5 &quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Package didn&#039;t arrive after 30 days, got 50% refund for it. Hard to tell if it was sent or not because my country supposedly has tough border security. However more likely the vendor just didn&#039;t send it and used that as an excuse to scam an easy 50% from such a large order.&quot;<br /><br />Who left this? Can you elaborate why do you think you have been scammed? Country of origin etc.<br /><br />Sound bullshitty to me that DT would compromise his feedback for a relatively small order (5 grams).<br />You are fucking mail ordering drugs from outside your country.

				Ordered march 15th no pack still and no forum presence from vendor. Due to the stats on my buying account it is likely that the resolution staff would have rules in his favor anyways but I finalized because I thougt a package slip was from him. I feel like vendor skirted like 5 noob buyers so he could satisfy all the others and knew about bit pin crash so the refunds wouldn&#039;t even hurt him...

Is he the market oracle I should be consulting on when to buy and sell bitcoins;)<br />Either way, price of btc doesn&#039;t matter to DT in this case because DT had all his orders hedged, so whatever dollar amount he had assigned to his items is what he was getting out.

				His SR page says he will refund directly in bitcions. At $250 dollars a bitcoin a crash is fucking obvious. It does not take a fucking crystal ball, OK?<br /><br />Also yes I have communicated with DT. He does not seem to understand my particular situation. He is pushing me to the resolution center, although I long ago finalized. <br /><br />Ultimately I sent my money to a stranger without a pack in my hand, yes its my fault, yes I deserve to loose 600 dollars on top of my mounting real life debt, HOWEVER, why are all the packs from march 15th gone? why has he not addressed this in the forums? And why has No1 said a pack from the 15th HAS arrived?<br /><br />Friday the 15th was the day they went on vacation due to spring break. Right, a bunch of druggies going on spring break and the last day they have to send drugs doesn&#039;t it seem possible they skirt there responsibilities? Imagine.... they would get SO MUCH out of that one day. I alone ordered 33gs. 50% refunds on 10 people ordering 33gs = 150Gs for the seller and enough REAL reviews to force SR to rule in there favor. Also, right before going on vacation. Spring break vacation. Like molly week vacation.<br /><br />1st message to DT was responded to with an all too vague and impersonal and uncaring manner, ignoring details of my (short) message and requiring me to send him further long elaboration which he will look at and think wall of text im sure.<br /><br />Anyways, im extremely sad and in debt. Good day.

				jizzmaggot: I&#039;m sorry to hear about your unfortunate circumstances.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally had at least 3 extensions, if not 4 so far.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that the SR staff gave you a refund if that&#039;s not what you wanted.&nbsp; Personally, I made another resolution shortly before it expired stating that I would VERY MUCH like an extension and that since the pack is still within it&#039;s &#039;delivery window&#039; that I&#039;d wait to see if it arrived.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t so far and at this point I don&#039;t think it will.<br /><br />thelovedragon:&nbsp; No actually, even if the hedged, if the price is going down when he settles and he gets less money, he still loses some in cashing out because cashing out isn&#039;t instant and who knows what relationship or agreement he&#039;s worked out with the people who cash him out?<br /><br />KaleidescopeVision:&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen you around for quite a while, and honestly I&#039;ve always kind of thought you had good, well-thought-out points and posts and a good level head on your shoulders. I still think that&#039;s the case, but I think you&#039;re getting a little excited or worked up about the situation, thus leading you to impulsive actions or keystrokes.<br /><br />Yeah, DT might not understand your position, but I&#039;m guessing English isn&#039;t his first language.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think all the packs from the 15th are gone, just a dozen or two.&nbsp; I know a bunch of people came forward on the forums, but not NEARLY everyone on the site has a forum account. <br /><br />His communication with me has always been professional and proportionate to my message to him in terms of tone, length, and detail.&nbsp; The only reason I can think it wouldn&#039;t be the same for you is if you were rash, incessant, rude or accusatory.&nbsp; Is this really true?&nbsp; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ordered march 15th no pack still and no forum presence from vendor.

				I finally received my order, 21 days after being marked in transit.&nbsp; Stealth was good again, but you could hear some rocks moving around.&nbsp; I had a bit of a panic attack after it didn&#039;t show up in two weeks like last time, but rest assured it will come!&nbsp; I honestly think the March 15th packs were some sort of error, because everyone else is receiving, whether it be in 6 or 21 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />In terms of quality, I don&#039;t know what to expect from this batch, because this one looks more white/grey, when my first order was more tan/brownish.&nbsp; However, if it is anything like the first batch I received, then this shit is FIRE!! Don&#039;t hesitate based on quality, because it is truly great.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />First of all; we&#039;re sorry about the delay in our response but we have been offline for a while. <br />Also it&#039;s very unfortunate to hear that some of you, ordered on the 15th, never received their package. Please know that all orders are only confirmed AFTER the order is packed and sent out for shipping. But counting the customers who didn&#039;t receive on this date is less than 10. All we can think of is that a part of this shipment was intercepted, as we checked some tracked orders from the 15th and they did arrive. <br />We offer all these customers a 50% refund, as stated on our profile. <br /><br />GOOD NEWS:<br />- Our listings will be back up on Tuesday April 23th<br />- We have improved our stealth and will be using MBB (Moisture Barrier Bags)<br />- As SR can&#039;t do anything in terms of refund after an order is already finalized, we won&#039;t request FE anymore (not for track&amp;trace either)<br />- Track &amp; Trace doesn&#039;t necessarily mean you have to sign for your package, however this depends on the country/region and your local mailman.<br />&nbsp; Therefore a signature MAY BE REQUIRED for a track&amp;trace package<br />- We&#039;ll be fully operating again starting from Tuesday, which means messages will be answered within 48 hours and orders will be packed/shipped and&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; confirmed within 24 hours. <br />- Tracking info will be provided immediately and together with the confirmation of your order. Please note that it will take 3-7 days before the tracking code will <br />&nbsp; be activated by the post office<br />- Post order companies are CLOSED during the weekend, which means sent out orders will not be put in transit during this time nor will tracking info be<br />&nbsp; activated or updated<br /><br />Thank you all for the good reviews and your patience during our vacation! We are looking forward to doing business with you all again on TUESDAY!!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />The DutchTrade Crew

				Just wanted to leave a review of DutchTrade&#039;s product. I had the pleasure of trying it on Saturday and was blown away.<br /><br />Background: 220 lbs, experienced with mdma. Last mdma experience was approx. 3 months prior. Wife partook in this experience as well.<br /><br />00:00 Parachuted about 160 mg. It was nice not to have to deal with powder--just too 2 decent sized rocks, weighed em up on my cheap scale and wrapped em in tp.<br /><br />00:20 Can start to feel initial effects. A little discomfort (kinda felt like I had to shit) but that quickly passed. We were watching a zombie movie and were making jokes and laughing at the extreme gore.<br /><br />00:45 Getting a bit more talkative and decided to turn the movie off as we weren&#039;t paying much attention to it anymore. Put on some Lemon Jelly and the milkdrop visualizer on the big screen. Heart rate increasing.<br /><br />1:00 I had set my alarm for an hour after ingestion for our booster doses. I was feeling really good and honestly felt like I didn&#039;t need a booster, but I wanted to prolong the level I was on. I parachuted about 70 mg more.<br /><br />1:00-4:00 These 3 hours were great. Very talkative and moving felt great. Danced with the wife for a bit. I don&#039;t know if the quality was just that good, or if my 70 mg booster was a bit too much, but I have never had the eye wiggles as much as I did with this. I couldn&#039;t focus on anything close to my face. I went through a lot of gum as well.<br /><br />4:00 Definitely feeling a slight comedown, but not bad at all. It felt like I was gently descending from the clouds. Wife and I started making out and I immediately got a boner. I have tried having sex on mdma before but it didn&#039;t work out too well, but this stuff I shot right up. We had all kinds of sex for about 45 minutes (she got sore) and I found it difficult to cum. Finally I was able to cum and boy did I ever. I had a very long/full orgasm that was pretty outstanding. Not as good as sex on lsd, but pretty fucking good.<br /><br />4:45 I needed a beer after that one, so we spent the rest of the night watching the visualizer and drinking beer/smoking pot. I was able to easily fall asleep about 7 hours after ingestion. The next morning I was a little groggy, but felt ok. Kinda had a burned out mdma feeling, but that really only lasted half the day. I also had a sore on the side of my tongue, no doubt from chewing my face off. Around 2:00 pm Sunday I had a large meal and that seemed to cure the hangover-like symptoms.<br /><br />All in all, DutchTrade has some of the best, if not the best mdma on the road. And for the price, it can&#039;t be beat. Now that Dutch is going to be using MBB, I will definitely be getting more from them later this summer.<br />

At least let the buyer have a choice if they want to take the risk or not, and only allow very large, untracked orders from very established and vetted customers. <br /><br />When I received the orange slip in my mailbox saying my 50g pack from you had arrived in only five days to the USA and was requiring a signature I grew a little wary. I had no idea my order would have required a sig as I chose the no sig option. Of course, once I picked it up, all was well and the packaging was stealthy enough to not arouse suspicion, plus I often pick up random packs through my unicorn dealing business, so the postal employees are familiar with me and very friendly :)<br /><br />However, I will not be ordering from you again until there is some compromise found in this policy! Your product, customer service, and overall operations are great! Especially now that you&#039;re adding MBB&#039;s....let me continue to be your customer!

Id rather lose the money from 100g and not sign for it then have to sign for it every time and possibly spend a good bit of time in the pen getting anally raped. Id rather not be someones bitch (:<br /><br />Would be quite awesome if you did this DT, and thanks for addressing the public<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>To get tracking to the states he needs to send registered mail which requires a signature.&nbsp; I don&#039;t blame you for not wanting to sign but in that case it really makes sense to buy maybe 25g instead of 100g.&nbsp; Yes the cost per gram is a little more but so are the losses if the pack doesn&#039;t show up.&nbsp; Just my opinion.<br /><br />PS I agree with your sig<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I was talking more about us trusting each other and not having to do tracking. But its completely understandable that he doesnt offer this. It would be a lot of work to decide whether or not people were trustworthy.<br /><br />Im curious to whether or not there are mom/pop mail places that will sign the packages for you when they are delivered. I&#039;m gonna look into this, and ill report back with my findings.<br />In the USA btw<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />UPS Stores will sign for you (and they are independently owned....the modern version of the mom/pop store in a way).

				Forgot to update back on it, but I got my order after about 16 days. Weight was 10% over and I had rocks up to 2.5g+. And man, this shit is STRONG. So far like 5 people I sold it to threw up from it being too strong and then rolling balls, mostly girls haha. I&#039;m glad he got better bags and I will be ordering another 50g for sure and after that I&#039;ll start using him for 100g orders.<br /><br />Also to those interested, I told him I wouldn&#039;t sign for anything and to not use a track&amp;trace on my order and he didn&#039;t.

				So, I am SUPER impressed with Dutch.&nbsp; <br /><br />While this is the first package I&#039;ve not received and I&#039;m not happy about that, I&#039;ve literally never worked with a vendor that had this level of communication, professionalism, or consideration for his customers.<br /><br />Dutch, while strictly sticking to his policy(which makes him a shrewd businessman) still went WAY out of his way to make sure to be fair to me.<br /><br />He deserves mad props.

				Trying to get my order sorted out with DT. Was super excited for my stuff, but it&#039;s been over a month and it hasn&#039;t come in. Either USPS messed up or they gave me the wrong tracking info. I think the former is more plausible.<br /><br />Edit: I should add that this is not the same name as my buyer account. My buyer stats are phenomenal as well.. The tracking information gives some wacky shit, says my package was in halfway across the country and then sent back to Germany.

				I had my very first order go through a similar process of bouncing around the US then ending up back in Europe.&nbsp; I was checking the tracking in ToR, might you have done the same?&nbsp; Thankfully the vendor (Albion) was more than helpful and reshipped even though it was admittedly my fault.&nbsp; Generally I think it&#039;s best not to check tracking at all if you can avoid it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s hoping you two can can work something out.

				Here&#039;s my take on it.&nbsp; DutchTrade is legit.&nbsp; My last order I asked them to help out because of the bitcoin crash and he much obliged!!&nbsp; He was even on vacation at the time and still took time out to respond to me. Not only did they respond but they also took time out of their off time to get me a package out!&nbsp; This is a world class crew!&nbsp; They have been nothing but professional, which leads me to believe that the people that are not being satisfied are possibly not satisfiable!!&nbsp; They are the same people that, after 5 days, send a message daily asking where their package is, if it was sent, when it was sent, what time of day it was sent. etc, etc.......!&nbsp; More or less unpleasable.&nbsp; I sent him a large chunk of change and just chilled for a few weeks, this shit is coming from halfway around the world!!!&nbsp; Then....walah!&nbsp; It arrived without any issues at all.&nbsp; Keep in mind I did NOT contact DutchTrade one time except to say thank you for helping me out in tough times!&nbsp; Someone actually came through for me when I was down!&nbsp; So I would say to all of the haters out there........take your complaining somewhere else!!<br />I received the grey/purple molly and was unable to test and verify the light purple on the test, however product was sampled last night and its decent.&nbsp; Smells of strong sassafras and is a nice contrast to the brown from the last order!&nbsp; <br />overall I give DutchTrade an easy 5/5 they surely earned it!!

				Whoa guys, chill the fuck out!&nbsp; Don&#039;t be climbing down Kaleidoscope&#039;s throat.&nbsp; He has a valid reason to be PISSED.&nbsp; As do I.&nbsp; In just about 2 years I haven&#039;t missed a SINGLE order with the exception of this one VERY small order of 5 grams from DutchTrade.&nbsp; He admits that they never left his country, and no other packs have been missing.&nbsp; That means the problem is on HIS end.&nbsp; If it&#039;s 50/50 risk, how come 50% of his packages don&#039;t go missing?&nbsp; Alright, that last question was a bit overkill, but you get the point.&nbsp; <br /><br />I HAVE NOT FE.&nbsp; Am I in the wrong too?&nbsp; Am I NOT supposed to be pissed because I don&#039;t have my drugs and this person has held up my money for EVER, AND IS RUINING MY BUYER&#039;S STATS?<br /><br />Grow up.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;ve received your packs, and I DO understand you being cynical of someone saying they didn&#039;t receive their shit when everyone else is and it&#039;s fire!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in your shoes.&nbsp; Honestly though, having received a note from the post office to come pick up and sign for your overseas package, usually indicates it&#039;s arrived.&nbsp; He finalized TO DO DT A FAVOR!&nbsp; I KNOW it&#039;s generally not a good thing to finalize before checking the product, but you yourself said you FE for him without an issue.&nbsp; You can bet your ass you&#039;d be upset if your shit didn&#039;t arrive, and he waited to Finalize till(as far as he knew) it was here.<br /><br />Honestly, it&#039;s a shitty situation for everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to say that DutchTrade has been SUPER polite, but unyielding on only giving 50%.&nbsp; That would be fair had it been an individual pack that went missing, or if it got caught in US customs, but he said they never left his country and it was nearly a dozen packs.&nbsp; That DOES mean the problem was on his end.&nbsp; That means I DID NOT share 50% of the risk.&nbsp; I&#039;ve NEVER lost a pack. EVER.&nbsp; Till now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m really livid.&nbsp; I&#039;m not being rude to anyone or cussing AT anyone.&nbsp; I AM saying that Kaleidoscope has a valid reason to be SUPER pissed.&nbsp; DutchTrade is a good vendor and everyone else is getting their stuff.&nbsp; He DID however, miss out on an opportunity to rise above the rest and become one of the truly great vendors by fixing a problem for a few established members, who had issues THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.&nbsp; He missed that boat, and that&#039;s ok.&nbsp; All of you are STILL getting great deals, just understand, that if something goes wrong, there&#039;s NO support for you.&nbsp; You take the loss of cash, or buyer stats, or both.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go slandering him, but I CERTAINLY won&#039;t order from him again.

				Dogs have a ridiculously good sense of smell, perhaps thousands of times better than humans.&nbsp; Somebody on the board actually got a drug dog and did tests with things like MDMA in 1x, 2x and 3x vacuum seals.&nbsp; The dog went crazy for the MDMA.<br /><br />MBBs cost like $0.20/ea.&nbsp; Night and day compared to plastic.&nbsp; There are some good threads on this board about them.

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />I think I&#039;d just stick with 10g anyway.&nbsp; You&#039;d think that would enough to last years but girlfriend+friends+redosing when you&#039;re high means it won&#039;t last forever.&nbsp; Still, I figure 10g is less of a loss if the package gets lost and less of a risk if the package gets caught.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit uneasy about shipments from Germany now ... sounds like some packs are now getting stopped although if they are getting stopped on the German side then maybe that at least means no controlled delivery.<br /><br />I may also just pay a premium and go with CloudSufer.&nbsp; He has treated me very well in the past, his stealth is top notch and his prices have come down.

My last pack of 20 was amazing, and i will be returning for a 50 pack coming Monday or Tuesday.<br /><br />Also, it was greatly appreciated that you gave 10% for free. And even more appreciated that you are still doing the 10% for free. <br /><br />You are currently on a climb that will soon be over.<br /><br />ATTENTION!!! DTC is gonna be at the TOP coming soon.

				Just got another nice pack from DTC. This one was about 2 weeks to east coast Usa.&nbsp; This stuff looks lighter than the stuff I got a couple months ago, which was amazing quality. No doubt this is too. This is not a complaint , but simply a fact: I have not received %10 extra yet. It&#039;s been 6% or 7% each time. No worries though, fucking shit is top quality for cheap. Free stuff is, well, free. But I wouldn&#039;t want anyone to actually count on or depend on the extra 10% as their profit or anything, cuz I haven&#039;t seen it yet. I am happy with DTC as always. Great vender. Keep it up son.

				DTC are true business men (or women).&nbsp; Quality product and great communication.<br /><br />I placed my first order with them not too long ago and they delivered on everything.&nbsp; Some of the nicest MDMA crystals i&#039;ve ever seen.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Things are going very good on the road for us. Thanks to all of you!<br />For our safety as well as for all our customers, we&#039;re taking a short break of 1.5/2 weeks. Hopefully by then our mbb supplier has new stock so we can provide the promised packing/stealth and service. All confirmed orders are packed and will be sent out this weekend. <br />We&#039;re looking forward to receiving your orders and doing business with all of you again within 2 weeks. <br />Please note that our new key must be used by then, to be able to decrypt and deliver your order!<br /><br />Your messages will be answered within the regular 48 hours. <br /><br />-DTC<br /><br />

				After a mini mental debate on whether to choose DT or Interways for my first 100 pack, I decided on DT and it&#039;s a decision that I&#039;m incredibly Grateful for making.&nbsp; I placed the order shortly before the DDOS fiasco, so naturally I was biting my nails for a few days.&nbsp; But behold, in 9 days a letter from grand ol&#039; Deutschland shows up :)&nbsp; I chose the Track&amp;Trace option, so I was expecting to have to sign and be at a greater risk for a CD.&nbsp; I was greatly relieved when I went down to the RLO office and simply had to flash my card in order to get the package (I live at my college).&nbsp; Our resident assistant, always eager to nab us potsmokers, unwittingly handed me enough MDMA to get our entire dorm rolling!<br />Ran up the stairs, down the hall, slammed the door, locked it twice, tore it open, weighed the rocks, and became overwhelmed with happiness.&nbsp; I swear I haven&#039;t felt like that since I was six years old on christmas.<br />DTC I love you all!&nbsp; Got a chunk weighing in at 64 grams! Also got a 25, a 16, and a 5.(approx. weights)&nbsp; I had no idea that the extra 10% was still going on, thanks to your unexpected generosity I&#039;ll be paying it forward. There&#039;s gonna be at least a hundred people rolling for free this weekend ;)<br />Packaging: 5/5 didn&#039;t receive the new packs with mylar, but quadruple sealed if the stealth counts as a layer.<br />Shipping: 5/5 9 days, didn&#039;t have to sign for package even though I got a tracking number<br />Stealth: 5/5 I&#039;ve familiar with this particular method, and it&#039;s never failed IME<br />Communication: 5/5 Always quick responses, and never irked by my admittedly bothersome inquiries.&nbsp; Fluent english.<br />Product: 5/5 Biggest rocks I&#039;ve ever laid eyes on, and IMO the quality is better than Interways.&nbsp; Had a close friend compare it to his first time. Damn that feels good :)&nbsp; I was taught how to wash, and may post my results later.<br />Price: 6/5 I love doing the thizzle dance and knowing that it only cost me $1.75 :) Selling $5 rolls will make it a snap paying back those pesky college loans for this semester. Can&#039;t thank you enough for that, debt sucks.<br />Overall: 6/5 I&#039;m not using any other mdma vendor, ever again. Ever. Was about to hit post and literally just saw the update that they&#039;re gonna be gone for a few weeks, guess I&#039;ll just have to wait :)<br />The only complaint I can make is that I was asked to FE, but the tracking number was a big reassurance for that aspect.

				Received my package today! I&#039;m so happy! It was my first international order and am glad I chose DT.&nbsp; <br /><br />Packaging: 5/5 - As stated above pretty it&#039;s much quadruple sealed.<br />Shipping: 4/5 - 15 days to US best coast. I guess mine just took a little longer then most but it arrived safe and sound.<br />Stealth: 5/5 - I might end up using this later lol. freakin awesome.<br />Communication: 5/5 - Quick responses even when SR was going down all the time for a few days. And even though I was a newb to SR they treated me with respect.<br />Product: 5/5 - Straight rocks and crystals son! smells and tastes like fire! I will be testing for real Sat night&nbsp; :D<br />Price: 8/5 - Hands down best price/quality ratio for MDMA on SR.<br />Overall: 6/5 - So glad I took a chance on DutchTrade! They really came through and will be my only MDMA supplier for 5g or more. I&#039;m kicking myself for not ordering more.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this vendor don&#039;t be. When the new listing come up in 2 weeks order with confidence.&nbsp; 8)

				Text convo with person I sold to:<br /><br />Buyer: Fantastic.<br />Me: Really? Hell yeah!<br />Buyer: Yeah man. Amazing.<br />Me: That&#039;s what&#039;s up.<br /><br />This is from a hippie that goes to all sorts of raves, concerts, and festivals (like bonaroo and electric forest). He&#039;s tried all sorts of stuff and even does reagent tests. When I sold it to him, I didn&#039;t think he&#039;d like it so much because of how much experience he has. I was pleasantly surprised to receive these texts. Can&#039;t wait to try it myself but it&#039;s much too soon. I like to wait at least 1-3 months.

				Alright so I&#039;ve been seeing nothing but stellar reviews on DutchTrade, but I don&#039;t know what to think after my most recent dealings with him. **For the record I have ordered from him before and it took 1 week exactly.. this was maybe a month ago** My most recent pack was marked &quot;in transit&quot; on April 25th. I am currently on day 16, and auto finalize is in 22 hours. I haven&#039;t received anything yet, and I have sent 3 messages to DT over the last 20 days and have received NO RESPONSE. <br /><br />What the fuck? Is anybody else having this kind of issue with him? My last transaction went so smoothly, he was responsive, quick, and very professional. I don&#039;t know what to think of this or what to do in the resolution center. Do I ask for a refund or extend? This is only the 2nd time I&#039;ve had to go to resolution :(

				Dutch Trade is legit. Received his product in about 2 weeks to North America. Tested it last night with some of my friends and it was amazing. Solid clean roll, top quality like the gear I got from PF last year. This vendor deserves your business.

				Ive also ordered a few packs from DTC, they arrived in about 8-9 business days for me (east coast USA).&nbsp; No problem with the stealth whatsoever, and yes, they had to be signed for.&nbsp; one of them had 9% extra, the other had 11%, banging product for the price.&nbsp; it was a smokey-grey crystal, pretty light in color. smells like a safrole base though.&nbsp; overall, I was very pleased, as this was my first transaction with him.&nbsp; I will definitely be back, as soon as hes done with his vacation.

I told him not to give me the tracking number unless it becomes a long time...and in 6 days he hasnt said any thing back to me? im confused I just sent him another message saying &quot;hey can you let me know were all good and what not&quot; Cuz some vendors have thee rules that may be over looked, It was just odd that I had seen he had seen my message bt didnt respond.<br /><br />I dont feel too worried yet i guess since he has such good reviews but can anyone else shed light on this?

I&#039;m in the US, and once it hits the US it gets handed over to USPS I guess. You will likely need to sign for it. If anyone is in the US and does not want to sign for it, you may need to ask for it not to have tracking.<br /><br />Time to ship to where I am has been better than past vendors. I&#039;ve ordered from 6 different international vendors for MDMA, and DutchTrade&#039;s shipping was faster and communication seemed to be much better than most of them.<br /><br />Product looks like the image above (large rocks mostly) - tested with Marquis/Mecke/Simon and all the colors came out right, solid colors. My friends who tested it personally enjoyed it.

				Communication - 5/5 - Dutch was very friendly and accomdating through the whole order, very surprised and pleased with his team.<br /><br />Shipping - 5/5 - Took 10 business days to reach both of my destinations which is very reasonable in my eyes. US.<br /><br />Stealth - 5/5 - I&#039;ve seen this stealth before but in different variations, definitely gets the job done but MBB is always an extra step that could be taken. He has already addressed this.<br /><br />Product - 5/5 - Very crystal clean, smells beautiful (not too strong), and weight was definitely over by 10% which is always a plus.<br /><br />Overall - 7/5 - Would definitely order again from Dutch, especially if he steps his stealth up another notch I can see him taking the top spot! Keep it up.

				Most of the MDMA on SR is very strong and very good but almost none of it is completely pure and without at least some sort of color.&nbsp; If your friend is used to seeing beautiful clear/white crystals then he&#039;s likely seeing methylone being sold of MDMA.<br /><br />Many people on the street look for the MDMA to be brown because if it is brown then it is probably legit MDMA.&nbsp; The brown is probably often from leftover saffrole (a precursor) ... just a small amount of saffrole can probably make the MDMA pretty brown.&nbsp; There&#039;s also been gray MDMA on SR that has been good.<br /><br />Get an ecstasy ez-test (marquis) and test the other stuff your friend can get vs the stuff from SR/DutchTrade.&nbsp; I would be surprised if you don&#039;t see a stronger reaction from the stuff from SR.&nbsp; Using the marquis reagent on MDMA will result in purple/black.&nbsp; you can probably reactions on youtube.&nbsp; methylone will turn it yellow.<br /><br />http://dancesafe.org/health-and-safety/adulterant-screening-kit-instructions

The colored rocks may look like white powder though when grounded down. Nowadays I usually perform a acetone wash and IPA recrystallization simply because I want to minimize the possible effects of heavy metal residues. While the washing and recrystallization does not remove the residues completely, it sure helps and you get these beautiful almost glass like crystals.<br /><br />As you said, you cannot distress enough the importance of getting an eztest kit. I know of a case where a guy I know almost died when he was sold a strong stimulant as MDMA. Good thing that he was accompanied with experienced friends who knew something was horribly wrong when he lost consciousness.<br /><br />What people should know is that you can&#039;t trust a vendor for your life. There have been some incidents when a vendor has sold either knowingly or unknowingly something completely different than MDMA. The eztest is a small investment for the safety of you and your friends. People should also know that getting an eztest is not prosecutable in the US neither in EU. Test everything you put inside of you.

				Has anyone else been having problems with DT replying to your msgs? I received a msg from them the day after i placed my order like a week ago saying they were unable to decrypt my address, even though it was marked in transit . Since then I have resent it a few times with a msg to let me know if it went through ok and confirm my order was on the way. I have not heard back from them and am getting kind of worried.&nbsp; :-\

				Has anyone ordered from DT since he came back and received it yet to the US?<br /><br />Also, has anyone had issues buying 50g and having to sign for it even when no track/sign was requested? There was at least one guy that complained about having to sign but who knows if he even read that no sign had to be specifically requested.<br /><br />Lastly, do his 50g orders come in the same package type as his smaller order? Is it splt in two? One of my previous orders with DT had a pretty big bulge in the packaging and it was only 20g.

				I have to say DT is a great vendor. My first order was perfect. The only thing I wish was that they had a little better communication with the buyers. I&#039;m not a vendor but I imagine they receive hundreds of pms a day. Replying to all those would be daunting to anyone. Having a dedicated Customer Service Manager to answer everyones concerns should be a must in this big of operation. There are other vendors that have this like nawlins and it works great.<br />Just a little feedback from a satisfied customer&nbsp; ;)

VERY well washed almost no smell... (smell is a impuirty) some of the rocks where so pretty i didnt even wanna break them up they just looked so awesome!&nbsp; I just placed another small order... ill see how this one looks... if anyone recieves recently please post pics or atleast give us some details.... im assuming these guys move so much that the batches change a lot and theres prolly more then one cook... which means different precursers.... which surrent precursers leave certain colors behind from what ive been read..... horrible spelling now my appoligies .... too many dabs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Subtickel... havent ordered from him personally... but ive herd that in the past it was some clumpy brown crap so i really dont know.... his pic now looks nice , maybe just play it say and get a small sample..... <br /><br />DT LOVE ALL DAY!&nbsp;

I placed 2 orders and he couldnt open the pgp... so i switched to the othe gpg or whatever the fuc it is that also does the same thing, resent him all my info and a few messages... and ALL of my messages have been unread <br /><br />my last order was flawless / amazing / and FIRE PRODUCT..... but these 2 have me worried...... and anyone confirm in transit / tracking numbers within the last few days?&nbsp; my two orders are STILL processing....<br /><br />Whats the rules on canceling a order?&nbsp; Is it a certain time period before you can clic the cancel button or do they have to cancel it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Dutch Trade PLEASE comment in here or reply to my messages............<br /><br />Strange how he pulled all his orders down.... the limit on how many you could buy when you select that part was VERY high.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />many vendors put something like 999 to the &quot;available listings&quot; tab<br /><br />1. Many people who order more than one listing at a time leave identical feedback. Or very similar. - No fucking vendor would be stupid enough to try to fake his feedback score by leaving 10x the same feedback with 5/5 rating.<br />2. If you&#039;d wanna buy shit from yourself, why&#039;d you really need to lower the price? - The SR fee isn&#039;t that high.<br />3. The listings aren&#039;t in stealth - They are completely unlisted at the moment<br />4. GPG4USB works just fine with his public key :)<br />5. Don&#039;t spam the review thread for unread messages<br />6. Stay calm - Vendors don&#039;t have infinite product 24/7/365<br />7. I just got an answer from DT concerning a few things - Told him to check out PlutoPete for MBBs<br />

				Alright, check it out my fellow worry warts. I placed a 10 gram order from DT about a week ago. The order stayed in &quot;processing&quot; for about three days. I messaged DT about it, they messaged back a day later telling me that it would be sent out that night. The next day, I checked, and my 10 gram order was indeed marked &quot;In Transit&quot;. I quickly went ahead to place another order, but this time for 50 grams. This was two days ago on the 6th, ( today is June 08). My 50 gram pack is still processing, and DT has taken down his listings. I don&#039;t blame anyone for worrying about this. However, with my experience with DT, and silkroad I am guessing that DT took his listings down because they are getting flooded with orders. I guess that because it&#039;s taking them three or four days to process these orders which probably means that they&#039;re backed up. I am confident that my 50 gram order will be marked &quot;In Transit&quot; within the next two days. I am also confident that DT will have their listings back up soon enough. Once they catch up. That&#039;s just my thoughts on the situation. :)

The bag was see through so I assume no MBB.

				hi Guys,<br /><br />Just an update from our side:<br /><br />Business is going very well. We are happy to have welcomed many new customers the past few weeks, which also means that messages and orders kept coming in like crazy. This is also the reason why it took us a little longer to confirm some orders and unfortunately had to cancel a few too. Sorry about this. Also because of the many orders, the post offices in our area ran out of tracking codes. <br />We are currently offline and plan to be back online after next weekend. <br /><br />We see some of you posting questions about having enough in stock on our vendor page but still taking down our listings. <br />We have a bulk in stock, unfortunately we can&#039;t split it in &quot;amount available per listing&quot; on our page, because if we do split it, SR staff can automatically take down a listings once it seems out of stock and we want to be able to control this ourselves. Therefore it might happen that we take down our listings even though it seems a certain listings still has enough in stock. <br /><br />we would like to reply to some of you guys posting on our forum topic:<br />- As most of you know: we&#039;re a professional, legit and honest vendor on the road so just to reply to &quot;Mindblower&quot; post: There&#039;s no reason for us to lower prices and add fake feedback! We would never do such thing. Feedback, customer rating and success rates are given by our customers, there&#039;s no way for us to control this or we would have to become a customer and buy from ourselves. <br />&nbsp;<br />- Toomanydabs: As we told you in the messages: It is stated on our Vendor Page that messages will be answered within 48 hours. So if you send us like 7-8 messages in one day, (sending multiple messages is one of the reason it took us such a long time to answer/confirm last week), you can&#039;t expect us to reply in a few minutes/hours after you sent a messages. <br />Besides that; Please consider the 6-7 hours time difference!<br /><br />- MrMdma: Many thanks for your advice in mbb suppliers and also for your reply on the forum, it&#039;s good to see that some of our customers understand certain things/delays. <br /><br />Hope this reply answers your questions and we are happy to receive your orders again after next weekend!<br /><br />-DTC<br /><br />

				I wonder how hard it would be to convert the freebase to crystal.... from my understanding pure mdma is in freebase form and is oil... wouldnt be smart to just ship a bunch of wine bottles full of it to someone that could turn it from freebase to hcl?&nbsp; Im sure its been done before but that would be super stealth!&nbsp; IMO..... Think about it customs gets a case of wine or even a gift basket with random items and a bottle of wine... i highly doubt they would open the wine.&nbsp;

				what i think is happening is when his listings are down him or his team probably package up 100s of packs so when they put there listings up all they have to do is slap a address label on it and drop in the box. as they run out of premade packs it takes longer to package em up and stay ahead of the 35-40 orders they are getting per day so as time goes on theyre shipping times get longer and longer until they pull there listings again and get caught up. hes had his listings down for over a week and at least 20 people are still finalizing there orders per day which just goes to show the insane volume hes going thru which also makes me a lil jealous that they are probably becoming so filthy rich in such a short amount of time. anyways thats my theory on shipping times and why the orders at the end of this last run are taking so long.<br /><br />now i have one question hopefully someone can answer. now say i order 30 grams i already know it will come in one delivery but will it come in 3 10g packs or 1 30g pack? just trying to figure out if i will need to break it down once i get it into smaller increments of 10 or will it already be done. thanks

				@ CORSAIR: Please take your scam and complaints elsewhere. Thank you<br /><br />Sorry guys, we&#039;ve heard that delivery time takes longer than usual from more customers. <br />we&#039;re guessing the German Post has been a bit slow the past 2 weeks, this could be due to the flooding in central Europe which &quot;hit&quot; Germany in the same week that the (now delayed) shipment was sent out.

Include a trusted friends phone number for more credibility. If they decide to call him, have that friend ready on phone and ask him to tell that fake name when answering.<br /><br />Usually the postal workers don&#039;t go that deep checking the backgrounds. They only need the letter as proof if someone&#039;s post get&#039;s stolen etc. <br /><br />Your number 1. option will work just fine. If you can, write the warrant letter with a computer and print it, then sign it and then photocopy it again so it looks like your &quot;friend&quot; has sent it to you from overseas.

Otherwise I&#039;ll be going somewhere else for the smaller size orders. <br /><br />Nothing has still arrived as of 2nd of July. Order marked in transit 5th of June. I am located within EU.<br />Will file a refund on Friday if it&#039;s not here by then.

				Subbing.<br /><br />I ordered from DT when they first opened shop and they were very generous in regards to my order being overweight. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to most likely place an order for 50g soon and may go with them if things start to go smoothly again.

				Well I came here to see about the recent feedback, wonder what&#039;s going on? It would really be a shock to me if this vendor was scamming. I&#039;ve used them for large amounts, 100gram orders, and thought DTC was a great vendor. The one thing was it took a couple days to respond to some of my msg&#039;s, but always did. If you choose the tracking option you will have to sign for the pkg, at least in my experience. I&#039;m watching this thread like a hawk because I want to make an order soon. The quality i received was grand. I believe it was the previous batch though, beautiful crystalline amber shards. I hope all is well w DTC and good luck to those waiting on orders. Mine took about 15 days. <br />

				<br />@Infowar: Please take your spam elsewhere!<br /><br />@TooManuDabbs: We understand the inconvenience of not receiving your package, especially since we &quot;misplaced&quot; the tracking. However, we were the ones offering you the 75% refund with the explanation that we offer you an extra 25% because of this missing tracking, so it wasn&#039;t SR Staff fixing that for you. Also yes the forum is the place to communicate with other customers and share experiences, but it&#039;s really not necessary to send multiple messages a day talking shit about us. Same as it was unnecessary to send 7 messages to us in one day, asking every hour why we didn&#039;t respond yet, when our vendor page states we respond within 48 hours. Hereby we kindly ask you to stop &quot;spamming&quot; our forum topic with all your messages. You received your refund, if you don&#039;t like our service/professionalism, we suggest you go to another vendor. --Thank you. <br />

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Here is a quick update from us.<br /><br />Our friend FASTWAYS is new to the road, so let&#039;s give him a warm welcome!<br />FASTWAYS is your specialist in Speed. <br />If your looking for an honest and solid vendor with top quality speed and the best price on the road.... Visit his vendor page and take a look at his Speed listings. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our listings have been back up since last week, please note that summer has arrived and we&#039;re also going on holiday. <br />Due to our summer vacation we will be offline from July 17th until August 5th. <br />So if you&#039;re planning to place a new order soon, please make sure you place your order before July 17th! <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So a few customers didn&#039;t receive their package yet, this is very unfortunate for them as well as for us. Please don&#039;t make this stop you from placing an order with us. The German Post has had some delay with delivery, due to the water flooding in Germany. we&#039;re happy to tell you this is over now, the German Post is back to its normal delivery/shipment time. Also most customers from that shipment have confirmed that they&#039;ve received their package by now. <br /><br />Please note that we&#039;re an honest and trustworthy vendor and DO NOT scam anyone! Ordering from the road is always a 50/50 risk and therefore we always give a 50% refund after a certain shipping time. Our overall success rate is still &gt;97% <br /><br />-DTC<br />

The problem with that stealth is that the Nordic customs are too well aware of it these days.<br />&nbsp;<br />You should consider creating a new second option shipping method to choose from, which would be a plain small business letter envelope, with that transparent plastic window for address info. This method could fit up to 10 grams of grounded up MDMA to make it flat. If you&#039;d also get your hands on MBBs finally (mylar or foil laminated mylar) you could improve your shipping to Sweden, Finland and Norway a lot. Almost all interceptions to these countries are only because they use highly trained drug sniffer dogs. <br /><br /><br />Also before someone starts to whine about me posting about shipping methods. This is nothing new for customs, it&#039;s known all around the world. However it is still one of the most successful shipping methods around for small orders simply because it blends in so well. This method equipped with MBBs is one of the best out there, for orders up to 10G.

				I really don&#039;t think he is scamming anyone. He is making good money and reputation is &quot;EVERYTHING&quot; for an SilkRoad vendor. I do however believe that the stealth could be changed to a more subtle and basic one for the orders up to 10G. I asked another customer and he told me how it had been packaged which confirmed my guess. What I know for sure is that, that method which they are currently using is well known by the customs around the world by now.<br />&nbsp;<br />The delivery rate could radically improve if the up to 10 Gram orders were shipped sealed in Mylar/mbb and packaged into ordinary looking business envelopes with paperwork or something inside. The MDMA would have to be powdered/grounded up well though. This might be a deal breaker for some of the funny people who cry if they don&#039;t get rocks, which I don&#039;t really get because the recrystallization process is so easy a 13 year old could do it.<br /><br />The recent refund feedback on his vendor page could be because a bunch of shipments were already caught when leaving Germany. The used stealth method is relatively easy to profile I guess, if they know what they are looking for. However, this is only speculation and should not be taken as fact.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				@MrMdma, if you have a tracking code, you can follow your package at any time. <br />Also we do respond to your messages, but you expect us to respond immediately, when our agreements on our vendor page state: we reply to messages WITHIN 48 HOURS. And about your package that hasn&#039;t arrived yet; it was marked in transit only 7 days ago. How fat do you expect a package to be delivered overseas?!<br /><br />For all of you customers: The fact that we offer a tracking option for all orders and even provide free tracking codes for larger orders should be enough prove that we are an honest vendor!<br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br />-DTC<br />

				I put an order in on last Friday, had the tracking # on Saturday, and it went active on Wednesday. Generally takes about 8-9 days after that point so I expect to see my 100 gram package to USA by next Thursday or Friday. DutchTrade has been impeccably perfect every time thus far.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about extensions and resolution process, we don&#039;t go anywhere without our computer so even on vacation your messages and resolution requests will be responded to (2 or 3 times a week). And of course when checking our messages and resolution requests, we will also check the forum. <br /><br />We were planning to go offline tomorrow, but because of our message about our vacation here on the forum and on our vendor page, orders have been coming in like crazy! Therefore we have pulled down our listings. The already placed orders will be processed tonight and tomorrow and will be shipped out tomorrow night.

It can take a bit longer because the post office is closed during the weekend.&nbsp; <br />So we hope your orders will get an update on the tracking codes and will arrive soon!<br />We try to answer your messages within 2-3 days.<br /><br />We will be back online in the first week of August!<br /><br />-DTC

				Go to another country and get the MBBs then.<br /><br />I do appreciate that you&#039;re delaying your return due to safety though.&nbsp; The old stealth/drops are no longer sufficient.<br /><br />Many vendors in the UK have figured out that it is best to send drugs as flat business mail.&nbsp; You can flatten and ship 100g in an A4 business envelope.&nbsp; The MDMA will need to be crushed but many customers would prefer crushed MDMA over a lost pack or a controlled delivery.&nbsp; Not all customers of course.

				@Slirp: Trust me, we&#039;re trying the best we can to get a hold on mbb, but obviously some of you think to know how shipping and customs work in our country better than we do, without ever been or worked here&nbsp; ;) It&#039;s not for no reason we choose to ship from another country. <br />As we believe in solid and long term business relationships, we chose to give our &quot;mbb&quot;vendor another 2 weeks to come through, meanwhile we&#039;re already looking into other options. <br /><br />As stated on our page: When our listings are up, messages will be replied to within 48 hours. Orders will be confirmed within 24 hours after placing your order. (Please keep in mind the 5-7 hrs time difference). So to be honest we don&#039;t understand what the comment &quot;you need to get your customer service together&quot; is all about, as we always do the best we can to live up to these terms. <br /><br />All orders placed on saturday/sunday were processed Sunday night, but when trying to confirm the orders we were thrown off SR and unable to access it for the rest of the night. Therefore all these orders were not confirmed yet, until today. They are all packed and ready to send out today though. <br /><br />We&#039;re looking forward to keep the business going with you all. <br /><br />-DTC<br /><br />

				Hello everyone and welcome back DutchTrade!<br /><br />I&#039; m getting ready to put in a bulk order with Dutch and am excited to see the new stealth! After two non deliveries in the past from DT I am nervous about this order as it will be my biggest yet; however, if DT is being truthful about his packaging being revamped and in addition to MBBs I am very hopeful it will arrive without problem. Obviously I will leave a detailed review of the whole transaction for those you are wary of ordering again with DT after his little hiatus.<br /><br />I have been one of the very first customers of DT&#039;s and every transaction has been excellent with the majority of my orders delivering amazing quality in quick transit times as well.

				Had some issues with another vendor while DTs absence. BTCs were stuck for 3 weeks in escrow. Was really happy when i saw, that I&#039;d be able to order the next package from legendary DutchTrade (never did so but big rep). Now order is&nbsp; processing for the third day and I noticed that there is no new feedback since they returned... And I just read that claim to be sending from somewhere else now.<br />Hopefully the long processing time is only due to packaging issues with too many orders(since they took out 2 listings)... But I&#039;m getting a bit scared again...

				Hi again,<br /><br />Sorry it took a while to confirm your orders, but we have experienced some problems with accessing SR the past days. More than likely so have you. This doesn&#039;t mean your order wasn&#039;t processed yet, it just wasn&#039;t confirmed <br /><br />You guys shouldn&#039;t believe everything that&#039;s been written on the forum, as some people put things here they assume but don&#039;t know for sure. As long as we didn&#039;t state to send it from somewhere else than Germany on our vendor page or forum, we obviously didn&#039;t change that! we are still shipping from Germany, have never shipped from anywhere else and won&#039;t. <br /><br />In the last batch before our vacation there were a few orders that didn&#039;t arrive. <br />The customers were leaving comments about their missing packages on this forum topic&nbsp; of course and this lead to a conversation between those customers, which made it seem like a lot of packages went missing, when really it were the same customers leaving comments about this to each other all the time. Nothing wrong with those conversations of course, because that&#039;s what this forum is here for but please know that our WORLDWIDE SUCCESS RATE IS STILL OVER 96% <br /><br />Our mbb supplier finally received his order and is able to deliver it to us after this weekend. So we are happy to inform you that we will be using MBB after this weekend!<br /><br />Our listings are currently down, this is only because our first batch is sold out completely. We will restock the quantity of all listings again tomorrow (Monday). Please look at the quantity on each listing, this will tell you how much there is left to order. <br />Thanks for all your orders guys, the fact that we ran out of stock within a week is good thing lol!<br /><br />When placing your order, make sure you leave your full address in the order. Addresses without postal code or country won&#039;t be shipped out!<br />We always send every customer a message and 2nd reminder to resend the address, please note that after not replying to this 2nd reminder, your order will be cancelled. <br /><br />-DTC

				Yo, DTC!<br />Now that you guys are confirming MBBs for shipment I can&#039;t wait for your to post the revised listings - It&#039;s after the weekend everywhere in the world by now.

				DTC,<br /><br />The next thing you should consider is that you would send the 5-10g MDMA orders as ground up crystal powder. Some people prefer safety over rocks and recrystallization is really easy to pull off at the customer&#039;s end. Vac seal it once for flatness, wipe with Isopropyl alcohol and then seal in MBB. Fold some paper around it and just make it look like regular business mail. This method also looks less noticeable in x-ray images.<br /><br />The bulky method I think you are still using is known by customs worldwide and some countries specially screen for stuff that get&#039;s sent inside those &quot;things&quot;.<br /><br />
