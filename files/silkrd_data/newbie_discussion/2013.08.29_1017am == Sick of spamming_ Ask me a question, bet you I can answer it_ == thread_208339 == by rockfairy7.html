				either buy a recipe from SR and rob your local high school for the lab equipment or a better idea is to watch &quot;breaking bad&quot; and take note of the master chef WW. he ends up with a whole pallet of money. please don&#039;t tell me how series 5 ends thou, have not seen the last couple of episodes. hope this insightful information is a valuable commodity to you. by the sounds of it you are a real go getter, didn&#039;t expect such a hard question right of the bat, so when you are successfully cooking yourself to success just remember where it all started and be grateful (and by grateful I mean free samples).<br />rockfairy - COW (conveyor of wisdom)

				well math is just a branch of science and as you can probably tell from my last post I am all over that science shit. enough fucking around thou: 2 + 2 needs a context to change it from meaningless data into valuable information. as a fully qualified conveyor of wisdom you can count on me to add the context.&nbsp; 2 points of meth (good quality) plus 2 good pills = one excellent night<br />your welcome

				Kevin Keegan, Ray Clemence and Ian Botham all captained England and played for Scunthorp United. Well done on the success of the English at the moment, beating the Aussies in almost every domain of sport, must be a strange feeling?

				Now I was only spamming to reach 50 posts but it must be a crime for me to keep such a wealth of knowledge to myself, plus technically since it is such insightful information with a context it is no longer spam. So I shall continue to unravel all your quandaries (rapturous applause)....<br /><br />Well were I come from a fairy is usually slang for a man who prefers the company of other men over women, and no offense is needed to be taken as I believe in equality for all. If one chose to dance on the head of a pin (god knows why) then on would want to dance on the worlds largest pin. Personally I like to dance on XTC and meth but each to there own. The area supplied by the worlds largest pin (I have calculated the surface area of this pin and there quiet clearly is a head on it, 2 x 1.5) is 3m squared. factoring in that each of these getleman would need .5m to dance effectively to their uplifting trance the answer = 6.<br />Just to prove I am not making this up: http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMCNPJ_The_Worlds_Largest_Pin_Beatenberg_BE_Switzerland

				Ah bong construction, my special subject. First of all you should be smoking buckets (that&#039;s what we call them in Australia) or maybe gravity bongs. Post again if you need further explaination but back to the original question: a material that is easy for you to cut the bong open for example and disposable juice or softdrink bottle that you are not attached to. Why? Because when you run out of bud and the desperation sinks in you can cut it open and scrape the &quot;poorman&#039;s Hash&quot; and cough like shit as you try to force it down to quell those desires. Oh to the good old days, unfortunately for me I have have a strong female in my life who doesn&#039;t like me hanging out with that friend anymore. Sometimes I get access visits on special weekends but the things we do for girls.... right boys?

				No snarkery intended. You must have a good farrier, spirit level and I all ways found it easier to make friends then enemies. Now to contradict myself: Neon Lights I hope the brake fluid leaks out of your car as you are navigating mountainous terrain (this prick ripped me off0.
