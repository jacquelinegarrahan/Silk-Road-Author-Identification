				This probably sounds stupid but everyone has to start somewhere.<br />I was wondering if someone can recommend a good place to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; I am still new to tor and am very paranoid (if you couldn&#039;t tell by my name) after reading about the scams out there and would like some advice from someone who has done this before.<br />Thank you

				www.bitinstant.com<br /><br />Great if you want bitcoins now, otherwise set up a bank transfer to some exchange sites like MTGox.com. It&#039;s not as quick but you can avoid some of the extra fees.

				Hey,<br /><br />There is this localbitcoins.com (not sure if .com) where you could find individuals selling btc to you in person, locally! I do not want to recommend this with warmth because I have been stood up so far (my location has only one registered local btc trader, somewhere in EU) but I believe there are many established legitimate sellers in countries like the US and what not. There is a feedback system and everything, I have no idea if this is 100 % reliable. <br /><br />I love the idea of this website because it really brings fees down to a minimum. If anyone asks, you are using your btc to buy coffe online and/or currency trade!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Entity

				Can anyone here vouch for CanadianBitcoin? Also, apparently they deposit direct to your wallet on your computer. Is this true. I&#039;ve asked someone on here already, but I too am paranoid and just want to make sure I do this right since I hope to make my first purchase soon...*giggidygiggidy*

				But what about large amounts of deposits like upwards of a thousand dollars. I like bitinstant, but there has to be a better way. too much fee&#039;s.

				Just wanted to report an update, I successfully transferred my money into bitcoins using CanadianBitcoin with my Bitcoin-Qt wallet. It was ridiculously easy.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m going to see about transferring it to my online account.<br /><br />Cheers!
