				Bought a some kush from MarijuanaIsMyMuse, After smoking a joint i began to feel very cold!&nbsp; pins and needles from head to toe. never thought much off it till after a sesh. was lying it bed feeling like shit! Getting pains all over my body.&nbsp; as any fellow weed smoker knows getting into a bed after a sesh it like winning the loto! there nothing better! I was left in a state of a weird paranoia... witch i never suffer from! EVER!<br />But anyway. After having my doubts of the product quality i stuck in under the microscope. and to my FUCKING HORROR i came across what look like synthetic cannabinoids mixed in with it.&nbsp; they where deferentially NOT trichomes!!&nbsp; &nbsp;THIS VENDOR IS TAMPERING WITH THE BUD!&nbsp; &nbsp;ether for weight or to make it &quot;stronger&quot; probably both! Look how he is manipulate his feedback removing.<br /><br /><br />Anybody else bought from him recently? <br /><br />

				Good shit for you KOF, sorry news for you OP. <br /><br />@OP, im sorry for you and your loss of funds on illegitimate product. Esp since its just bud, sadly, its no ones fault but your own. MIMM has been known to be a SS (selective scammer) for quite some time now. How he does it im not sure, how ever it is he picks and chooses who to fuck and who not to fuck.<br /><br />Another shit point of MIMM and his fuckery, is that he has not and most likely will not, be banned for being a scammer. In some light, you kind of have to give credit to him and others like him for being able to continuously get over on people like you. Read the forums man, you should have been a member from the moment you joined the market place. Never FE, for any reason. To be extra secure in your buys, dont even FE when you get it with out testing it in some way or another first. Many of the excellent vendors in fact encourage this. That does not mean, let it AF. Just as soon as you get the chance (in a timely fashion, of coarse) try it out, or run a test or two on it.<br /><br />@KOF, your one of the luckier ones man. Though, when he does send legit product to whom ever may be trying to buy some, ive always heard that is was quality gear.<br /><br />
