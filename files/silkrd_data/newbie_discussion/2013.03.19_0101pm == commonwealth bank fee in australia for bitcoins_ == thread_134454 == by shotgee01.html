				hey everyoneeee :)<br /><br />so im new to SR, making my first purchase today with bitcoins and on SR..<br />just wondering, im from australia and i deposited $60 at commonwealth bank but only had $51 of it go into my bitcoin wallet on blockchain.<br />is it normal to not get the full amount? did commonwealth take out that $9 for a fee of depositing bitcoins or did something go wrong in the process?<br /><br />either way its fine ive made my purchase and all is good but just wondering if this was a one time thing or if i have to always put extra into my wallet..<br /><br />thanks :)

				No, sorry. I too am an Aussie SR user and i&#039;ll have to inform you that the bitcoin vendor/company you bought the bitcoins from charged a commission&nbsp; which is the fee you speak of, and which is what they usually tend to do.<br /><br />Happy travels.

				Yeah man i have had 6 successful orders some domestic some overseas... so far i have only had 1 order that didnt make it but it is coming from overseas so it is possible it will still arrive but overall if you cant obtain certain drugs AFK then SR is the place to be!

				i was using spendbitcoins for a while but found that bitinnovate processes the coins quicker,better rate and only 7.9% fee compared to 10% i think it is with spendbitcoins.

				If you order domestic its almost 100% that you will get your products i think you will be suprised at the stealth many vendors use and after you receive a few items it makes you feel a lot more at ease with ordering not to mention the awesome feeling of opening your mailbox and seeing envelopes that you know are filled with amazing goodies! Good luck on your purchases bro out of curiosity what part of australia are you in im in brisbane.

				haha yeah i cant wait until i get what ive ordered if it gets through customs. first order was international so i hope i get it but it was only small so if not its not a huge loss. just sucks that the cost for things here is almost triple the cost of what it is to get from other countries. good luck to you to bro. im from newcastle. north of syd.

				Yeah im not really sure why australian vendors seem to have much higher prices than overseas it is kind of frustrating but if you look hard enough you will find some aussies giving good deals depending on what substances you are into.
