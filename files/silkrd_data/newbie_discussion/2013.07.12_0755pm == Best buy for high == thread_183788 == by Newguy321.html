				<br />So what is the best buy for a good high. I am really looking at scripts. I take 120mg Oxycontin + 75mg of Oxycodone daily. I am in tons of pain from being shot in Iraq and need something to help. I have some extra Oxycontin&#039;s that I will take 1 extra of and that seems to help.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m anti opioid.. The drop off is HIGH and it is horrible for long-term pain.. <br />Duragesic / fentanyl patch are good for pain as an alternative.<br /><br />Other than that I&#039;d recommend the following marijuana strains<br />Hindu Kush (indica)<br />Cali Gold (indica)<br />Purple Urkle (hybrid, mostly indica)<br />Grand Daddy Purple(hybrid, mostly indica)<br />White Berry (indica)<br />Northern Lights (indica)<br />Sensi Star (indica)<br /><br />and occasional MDMA usage will be amazing for you.

The Opiods will only lead to more opiods until you&#039;re trapped in a vicious cycle.&nbsp; Fentaynl patches can be extremely dangerous too.&nbsp; Look into THC edibles as well as some good medical indicas.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been shot so I don&#039;t know that pain, but it helps with the chronic pain I deal with.

				The only problem with THC stuff is I have random drug test from my PM doctor. I guess I just need to buy some extra of the same stuff I take. You are right about the cycle though. I am stuck in it now.

Drop oxy before it consumes your life and money. Besides, medical strains meant for pain relief work better, trust me, I was shot in my lower back and have horrible back pain from a damaged disc. Regarding MDMA, it&#039;s bad too and it can only be used a few times a year to keep the effects from dwindling, or you could use it in low doses, but on my worst days I mite take a little for that extra relief. I occasionally experiment with other drugs for pain relief too, but avoid regular dosing so I don&#039;t get addicted. Ketamine is good for pain. Few RC&#039;s, etc.

				PM=pain management. I was a a 100mcg fentynal patch for a while but now I have a little one running around and I am scared that it might fall off(mine did) and get into his hands.

I thought it perhaps was a doctor required by a job position or something similar. Up to you on what you want to do, but if it&#039;s a similar situation to me where the pain will be there forever, then drop opioids and start self medicating, medical marijuana edibles, etc.

				Best buy for the high I think is pure powdered benzodiazepines. Offered regularly on the road. A gram will last for weeks.
