				Hi!<br /><br />Is this the same guy? It sure seems like it. Fuente fucked me on much money. He is not seller anymore. Doesnt answer my messages.<br />WhiteDreams is a seller for two months. Funny he starts to sell when La Fuente stops.. <br /><br />Does WhiteDreams send from Mexico like La Fuente did?

				From what I understand, there coke is similar in quality, but the price white dreams is offering at beats everyone else, including what la fuente, had by a mile.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting for a good amount of people to say they have received the coke they FE&#039;d for. I really want to make an order. <br /><br />

				no WhiteDreams does not send from Mexico. he doesn&#039;t state where he ships from so that particular country&#039;s mail doesn&#039;t get scrutinized, but i know for a fact it&#039;s NOT Mexico<br /><br />and for the record - La Fuente was a good vendor, he was selling awesome coke for dirt cheap and all of my packages came through. i think he was actually a victim of his own success and authorities of various countries bought from him so they could profile his mail, rather than turned scammer

				I&#039;m not an expert on coke but I&#039;m of the understanding that 1 gram of pure cocaine can easily fetch £100-150. So his 250g listing is £25k-37k worth of coke for like £4.5k... LOL! I can&#039;t see LE not picking up on this but I hope I&#039;m wrong of course!
