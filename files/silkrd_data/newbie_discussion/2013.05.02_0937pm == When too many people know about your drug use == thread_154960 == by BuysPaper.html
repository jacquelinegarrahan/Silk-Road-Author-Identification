				I have some friends that I&#039;ve known for a long time. I made the mistake of thinking they were the type of people I could tell anything to in confidence and now pretty much everybody who knows me knows that I&#039;m a drug user.<br /><br /><br />Has anybody else experienced this before?<br />Is there anything I can do to get people to forget about it?<br /><br />Basically, what should I do for damage control?

				First of all, if you can&#039;t trust your friends to not gossip about what you do in your own private time, it sounds like its time to find new friends.<br /><br />Second of all, why is it so bad to be a drug user? It&#039;s likely 90+% of people in America are drug users in one form or another, and what you do in private is none of anyone&#039;s business but if someone does find out and they judge you, they can go fuck themselves imo. Who needs more ignorant judgmental people in their life?<br /><br />I approach it with a quiet confidence. I don&#039;t talk about what i do, but not because i&#039;m ashamed, its for these two reasons only: <br /><br />1. It&#039;s no ones fuckin&#039; business what i do in my private time that affects no one but me<br />2. It&#039;s currently illegal in my state and the way you get away with illegal shit is to keep it to yourself.<br /><br />There are people i know that know i use drugs, but they are usually drug users as well. There are very few, maybe 1 or 2, that are not illegal drug users that know my business and that is usually because they are unavoidably close to me.<br /><br />Never be ashamed of who you are, never feel guilt about bucking the status quo and making up your own mind about what goes in your body.<br /><br />Those who are judging you should be ashamed they don&#039;t have the fortitude and confidence to branch out and try something new, explore new regions of consciousness and reality so don&#039;t fear them, don&#039;t worry about their perception, pity them for they&#039;ll likely never know what you and I know.<br /><br />&lt;/high rant&gt;<br /><br />

				100% true what you say about finding new friends, this has been a wake-up call for me.<br /><br />The main problem with people knowing about this is that word might spread to my family(I have a wealthy father who is extremely anti-drug, I don&#039;t want to get cut out of the inheritance, that sounds bad, I know, but he&#039;s a wife-beater so don&#039;t feel too sorry for him). The other problem is that I&#039;m in college and I don&#039;t want problems to occur.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been a little weird so rumours have always been spread about me, and they always find their way around fast. It makes me get a little insecure sometimes.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to &quot;quit&quot; drugs for the people who don&#039;t need to know about my drug use. I hate lying but it seems like the best option to me.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s time for an &quot;I have a problem but I&#039;m recovering from it now&quot; bullshit speech.<br />

				Ah, see, i didn&#039;t start doing drugs until i was in my early 20&#039;s so i didn&#039;t have to depend on anyone to live (or to get a phat check ;) <br />In that case i&#039;d go super stealth mode, my buddy who&#039;s still in college smokes and he has to exhale into an empty plastic coke bottle with dryer sheets in it and holes cut out from the bottom to hide the smell lol.<br /><br />At the end of the day you have to do what you have to do to maintain your lifestyle. I don&#039;t envy you, good luck sir.
