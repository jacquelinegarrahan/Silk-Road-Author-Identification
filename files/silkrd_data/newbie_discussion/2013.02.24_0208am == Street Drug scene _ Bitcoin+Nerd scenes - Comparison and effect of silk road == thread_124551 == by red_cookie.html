				I would like to get some input from you on an issue that has been intriguing me for a long time. I am somebody you could call a computer nerd (or at least somebody who knows some computer nerds). I am interested in technology and through some people from the Bitcoin scene I heard about Silkroad. Obviously these guys had been too timid to try it out themselves. I was not and now I can order, test and try pretty much any illegal drug I want to. A real candystore.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; <br /><br />However I do not have any other people I can share this experience with. Sure, I told my best friends about it and we had a line of coke together. But there is no group dynamic developing which is in a sense a very good thing. Being rather&quot;brainy&quot; I also do not expect to lose myself like &quot;normal&quot; drug users do.<br /><br />Now my question: How many of you are similar to me in the sense that they are lonely seekers coming from the bitcoin or similar communities? People who approach drugs from a &quot;controlled risk&quot; angle? <br />And who of you knows both worlds, the street drug scene, i.e. the normal drug scene and the bitcoin-silkroad-computer-nerd drug scene? And how do they compare?<br /><br />I am wondering. One of the reasons drugs and drug users have such a bad reputation is the fact that normally drug users are associated to the crime scene and are on average pretty shitty people, who cannot control themselves, have serious psychological problems and traumas, come from underprivilged social strata, ... Plus you have gangs, peer pressure, .... (these are at least the stereotypes)<br />On the other hand most silkroad users are probably very nerdy guys, cutting-edge technology fans, libertarians. out-of-the-box thinkers, ... People who would have never even had an opportunity to buy marihuana, because they look too white-bread, too well-behaved ... (again just my guess)<br /><br />I am not really quite sure myself about the point I want to make. Probably that silk road has opened up drugs to new consumer groups and that this will also have an effect on consumption patterns, and so on.<br />What is your opinion?

				I&#039;m an example of someone who wouldn&#039;t be able to smoke weed without the Silk Road. I&#039;ve got a friend that is deeply ingrained in the whole drug scene in my city, and I used to get my weed through him. I could only get it on his terms, and would often be sat around for 4 or 5 hours and end up with some contaminated, sub-par product. Now Silk Road gives me the freedom to get weed anywhere, whether I&#039;m at university, on holiday, or wherever. It certainly does mean that drugs are accessible to a whole new social group. <br /><br />As someone whose education and expertise is in Computer Science, I&#039;m not exactly cut out for going around night clubs and asking for weed, or going into drug dens and asking for a dealer&#039;s number. So the Silk Road is a unique opportunity for me, and I expect thousands of others in the world.

				I actually progressed from the street to the nerd.&nbsp; When i was younger ....wayyyyy.... younger i would sell anything I could get my hands on, so coming across product was easy.&nbsp; a decade later i got kids, a business, and have broken ties with most of those people that were my hookups.&nbsp; so now this is the onyl source I can get my hands on, cant risk anything now I have a family. but ive always been the nerd, just more legally challenged as a youth.
