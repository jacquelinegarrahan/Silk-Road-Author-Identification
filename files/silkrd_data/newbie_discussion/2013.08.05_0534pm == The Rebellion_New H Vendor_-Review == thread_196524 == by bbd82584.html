				Ok, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So I had the good fortune/luck of catching The Rebellion&#039;s round of $1 samples of #4/East Coast Style.&nbsp; There was a small hiccup in shipping though I attribute that to the vendor just getting used to the system and ultimately, the time it took to ship was certainly competitive vs other domestic H vendors on SR.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect the order to arrive today, so when I popped open my mailbox and saw that I had priority mail, I had to fight the urge to tap-dance at the mailbox area in front of my neighbors at my apt complex.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Without any details, I&#039;ll say that the stealth method was something I&#039;d never seen before but it&#039;s genius.&nbsp; Always puts a smile on my face to see that the vendor has really put thought, and therefore care/love/effort into my order.&nbsp; Everything was appropriately sealed and I&#039;m confident it would pass a &quot;nosey roommate&quot; test easily.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect as far as the amount-after all, it only cost $1.&nbsp; Again, The Rebellion put a smile on my face when I found what was easily over a 1/4G.&nbsp; The whole sample easily dissolved in 1/2cc of cool water with no heat necessary.&nbsp; The resulting color was Pepsi-ish with a grey-ish tint.&nbsp; It tasted more bitter than I&#039;m used to, maybe it was cut with something I&#039;m unfamiliar with, who knows.&nbsp; The rush (I only IV) was very pleasant and there was no sign of the pins &amp; needles which in the past has indicated a presence of morphine in street-level product I have obtained locally.&nbsp; The high was what I had hoped for, and as far as I can tell so far-the legs are what they should be from H.&nbsp; (Disclamer/Full Disclosure: I&#039;m on 45mg methadone daily-so my tolerance def exists&nbsp; :P)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all, The Rebellion made my day today! Can&#039;t say enough that I really do believe that his product stands up to anything else I have tried on the Road, and aside from the odd growing pain, The Rebellion&#039;s service is friendly, and I have confidence that he/she/they will grow to become a respected #4 Vendor in our community.&nbsp; I certainly recommend that you give The Rebellion a shot and see for yourself how he stacks up against your favorite vendor!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE: Recently, I have tried IV opiate products from Hatter26(now gone), SuperSun(BTH), MarloStanfield(#4), UndergroundSyndicate(&quot;synthetic&quot; H), and Seneca(BTH).&nbsp; I honestly felt that The Rebellion&#039;s product ranks among the best I&#039;ve had from the Road.
