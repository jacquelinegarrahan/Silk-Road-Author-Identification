				I appreciate your posts here in purgatory.<br />While I have kept modest security for many years, my activities here are an entirely new level of security that I only have small knowledge and experience at. so I am still learning.<br />This account here isn&#039;t even tied into my SR account I setup. I am that paranoid.<br />All my docus and keys are in a locker and I haven&#039;t even done anything yet. Just getting ready and reading.&nbsp; :)<br />And joking around and getting bad karma for it apparently but fuck them.

				If something sounds to good to be true it usually is?&nbsp; Seems like an okay one.<br /><br />Misinformation is a BIG one.&nbsp; I like to use it by spreading misinformation about myself so when LEO goes to look for me they&#039;re looking for a half-snake con man named Gemini.<br /><br />But honestly, you should thank all those retard fuckers getting popped as it wastes LEO&#039;s time, and that is time well wasted.
