				I have only owned bitcoins since mid-January and have seen the value of my leftover bitcoins jump from $18 to $24 per ea.&nbsp; That&#039;s 33% increase in just a couple weeks.&nbsp; I&#039;m really wishing I had invested more.&nbsp; BUT... looking through some historical charts of bitcoin value I see that this is really unprecedented and may be a sign of a failure of the currency, IMO.&nbsp; I am not an economist and am interested in the opinions of others.&nbsp; This seems like the time to trade all my coins away and definitely not buy coins.&nbsp; I mean, it has to crash right?&nbsp; What do you think???

				I&#039;m curious why btc doesn&#039;t inflate the coins by sending out the active accounts with BTC in them say 30% increase to stock. That would then also drop the prices back down to around $20 while not screwing with peoples invested money. Inflation is good economic policy, I know it&#039;s what kept me away from SR for a couple of years, and I&#039;ve been kicking myself for years for not grabbing btc when they were around $1/per (man I&#039;d be much richer now, but that was also when they were holding steady between .8 and 1.2 per coin and everyone thought it would fail). That is why I&#039;m glad SR added static pricing in USD so no matter the fluctuation in btc I am still paying a reasonable price per item.

				Mr. High<br />Ok, that helps.&nbsp; I was looking only at the last year, but extending it back shows the big jump to and fall from 30 around June &#039;11.&nbsp; Fell all the way down to ~$2.5 per ea by Nov. 11.&nbsp; I sure would have hated to be the guy who bought in at 30 and didn&#039;t sell it all immediately.&nbsp; This seems to be a very volatile currency.

				I too have thought of investing in BTC in the past, but I&#039;ve always been scared that this whole thing might collapse.&nbsp; I think governments are going to &quot;nip&quot; this decentralized currency in the bud.&nbsp; It is way too un-controllable for a governments liking I would believe.&nbsp;
