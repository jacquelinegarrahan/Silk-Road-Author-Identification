				First let me say, thanks for taking the time to read. I have been trying to figure this thing out for days, and am now almost ready to give up, so I&#039;m hoping one of you fellow silkroaders can help me. I have a mac, and I have downloaded GPG, I have also been on their website and gone through the tutorials. I followed their instructions to send an encrypted email to myself, and I did receive it, However I could not open it. Every time I tried to open it, it would give me a code 0 or something like that, and say I failed. What am I doing wrong?! Secondly, how do I get my entire long PGP code, so that I can post it in a forum like this one for instance, and receive stuff from people? If someone could help me out, I would really appreciate it! Also if someone could work with me and let me send them a message and them send me one back that would also be a huge help. Thank you

				well, Im not sure how the mac gpg program works but in the tutorial it should say somewhere about how to access your public key. this is the one you use to give to everyone else.

				I just got this working on my macbook recently.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how computer proficient you are, but I only know how to do this via the command line, so get ready for it.<br />Start by installing gpgtools (I think you did this already) from https://gpgtools.org/<br /><br />Then quit the program and docs they open in safari.&nbsp; <br />Make a folder in your home directory, call it &quot;gp&quot;.&nbsp; In that folder save text files with the gpg keys you would like to import, such as &quot;import1.txt&quot;<br />Verify that the folder is called &quot;gp&quot; and the files are there with the proper GPG text.<br />Now in that folder, make a text file, message.txt, with your message.<br /><br />Next, open &quot;Terminal&quot; (in Applications/Utilities).&nbsp; <br /><br />Copy and paste the commands as follows:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">cd /User/&quot;YOUR USERNAME HERE&quot;/gp<br />ls -lh</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you should see the text files - good<br /><br />now run this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">gpg --import import1.txt<br />gpg --import import2.txt<br />gpg --import import3.txt<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>...etc for each key to import.<br /><br />Now we will make sure they imported<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">gpg --list-key</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You should see the keys listed, and most importantly, NOTE THE EMAIL, it has to be EXACT (case sensitive etc)<br /><br />Now, we are ready to encrypt a message for one of our imported keys.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">gpg --recipient THEEXACTEMAIL@TORMAIL.ORG -a --encrypt message.txt <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />After a second or two, you should see a new file in that folder, message.txt.asc, that contains your encrypted message.&nbsp; Great!<br /><br />Paste that text, send your message now let&#039;s clean everything up.<br /><br />make SURE you&#039;re still in /Users/&quot;YOUR USERNAME&quot;/gd<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">pwd</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if this command does not list that directory, DO NOT CONTINUE - you could break your operating system<br /><br />as long as you are still there (you should be), do the following:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">rm -Rf *<br />cd ..<br />rm -Rf gd</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this will remove all the files we created.&nbsp; now lets get those identities out of gpg<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">gpg --delete-key THEIRADDRES@EXACTLY.COM</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Done!<br /><br />Best of luck<br /><br /><br />Hopefully this helps.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				oh, and i don&#039;t think you want to mess with gpg in your email, and tying silk road etc to your email - stick to it the way I mentioned and there should be no trace left after you send your messages

				Do you specifically want to use GPG with e-mail or is it more for SR use? <br /><br />To get your public key, right click in textedit/whatever and &#039;insert my public key&#039;. <br /><br />Before you do this you&#039;ll need to go system preferences&gt;keyboard. Click services in the menu on the left and scroll down to the PGP options, enable the things you think you&#039;d need. <br /><br />How did you encrypt your message if you cant get your public key?<br /><br />Message me if you want more help, there&#039;s also the newbie pgp thread for people looking to encrypt and decrypt messages.

				@ twofish, I appreciate it, but I am not good working out of the terminal. That was just confusing me more, I do appreciate you taking the time to type all of that out though! @tiger Just for silkraod purposes, I don&#039;t really send sensitive emails so for that I do not really have the need to encrypt. I encrypted the message using an 8 digit short id they gave me, but I would like to figure out how to see the whole code, as well as everything else, I wish a developer could make a more user friendly program, because the ones on the market now suck IMO

				Cool, you don&#039;t need to use terminal in that case. <br /><br />Do as I said in my last post to get your full public key. Of course, if it&#039;s just for encrypting your address you don&#039;t need to see your public key.

				I&#039;ll try man, thanks a lot. I did all the keyboard preferences, is textedit for this specific program? I didn&#039;t see it as an option. Probably should just message you lol

				download GPG Keychain Access. <br />Install.<br />Open.<br /><br />Whenever you find a vendor you want to use, copy their Public Key.<br />Create a text document ( I use TextEdit, but any word processor will work)<br />Paste their public key into the word processor.<br />Save.<br />Go to GPG Key Chain Access.<br />Select &quot;Import&quot;<br />Choose the file you just saved with the vendors public key.<br /><br />Now the vendors public key is in your keychain access.<br /><br />Now, whenever you want to send them an encrypted message, open you email client on your mac, select the compose button. (you will not be sending an email, bare with me.)<br /><br />Type your address, or whatever message into the compose email window.<br />Highlight the text and double finger click or right click (whatever your configuration)<br />At the bottom you will see &quot;services&quot;&nbsp; click &quot;OpenPGP: Encrypt selection to new window&quot;<br />Next, you will see a window pop up and you should see the vendor you selected in the window, check the box next to their name.&nbsp; At the bottom you will see a drop down box that says &quot;secret Key&quot; select your account. (If you dont have one you can create one by selecting &quot;New&quot;&nbsp; from GPG KeyChain access and create a new key)<br />&nbsp;then click ok, and then, boom!! Encrypted message. Copy and paste into the vendors address box when you order your product.<br /><br />Thats how i do it. Very easy once you do it once correctly.<br />
