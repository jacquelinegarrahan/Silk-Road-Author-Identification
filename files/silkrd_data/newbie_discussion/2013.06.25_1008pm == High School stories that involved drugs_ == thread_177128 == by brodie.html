				I was a junior and decided it was a good idea to take shrooms for the first time in my life during school. I took them with a friend in the AM around like 9, and started to feel them in my stomach within 30 minutes (we took about 2.5 grams each). We happened to be in the same class when our trip really started to kick in, and then I noticed he had a blank stare (as if he saw a ghost). Instead of saying anything I just looked away, and by the time i looked back he had (literally in complete silence) puked all over his desk and into his backpack on the side of him. This made me feel it in my stomach more and more, so I got up and walked really fast out of the room.<br /><br />About 30 mins later when I came out of the bathroom ( I never puked I was just really sketched out and trippin) they&nbsp; called me into the office and asked why I ran out of the room and I told them that when people puke it makes me want to puke. They (principle/intern) looked at me like they were confused and called up to the room to talk to the teacher. They asked if anybody had puked and she said no, which completely blew my mind to the point of standing up in the middle of the office and apparently &#039;yelling&#039;&nbsp; &quot;There&#039;s no way&quot; a bunch of times.<br /><br />They then concluded that I was on a drug (they were insinuating that I had smoked weed earlier) and searched through all my shit and found nothing but some j papers which was enough to get sent home for the day.<br /><br />I find out the next day (from someone who sat near me in that class) that my friend who puked ended up scooping it all into his back pack using his binder. And I guess he cleaned up the rest with some napkins and the teacher never found out.<br /><br />To this day my friend has never confirmed that that is what truly happened.<br /><br />anybody else have any stories?

				Best I have ever seen was when I was year ten and it was the last day of school for year elevens before college etc. One guy who was a notorious pill head had double dropped on two Mitsubishi Turbo pills which at the time (eight years ago) were the nuttiest pills we had access too. <br /><br />I remember walking past him in his English lesson and seeing his jaw chattering like mad, eyes stretched wide open, standard foam at the corner of his mouth just staring at me out the window, I could not stop laughing for ages, found out he had only been able to take thirty minutes of the lesson before running as fast as possible out the door.<br /><br />

				When I was a freshman I took a gram (or less) of this crystaly dank bud from this scumbag drug dealer cause he just left it in his pants pocket in the gym locker room. I ended up saving for a party the following weekend that the drug dealer was at, smoked him up (along with a few others) on a blunt of his own shit, and later that week he ended up giving me a free gram for smoking him up.<br /><br />A free gram to a freshman is like hitting the lotto btw.<br /><br />

				My friend brought a big ass bag of vodka to school my junior year. (dont know how it stayed in the bag without leaking.) we walked to the bathroom and drank the whole bag. was in the bathroom a good ten or fifteen minutes before i had to take a dump. Sat down and passed out. Didnt wake up until the janitor came about an hour after school was over to clean the bathrooms. Was to drunk to drive home so had to call my friend to come get me. Lets just say i stick to weed and 25i now in my college years.
