				Title: <strong>Question</strong><br />

				I have a customer who received a parcel and could not find the product at first because of the stealth.&nbsp; Since he thought he was scammed he reported me. He has since found the product and left a 5/5 feedback. My question is does reporting a vendor affect negatively affect the vendor account in any way? Even it was just a mix up?

				I would have a word with the customer and since this deal has ended on good terms you could ask him to message SR Support and ask if any negative flags on your account can be removed as it was just a misunderstanding.<br /><br />Oh, and well done for hiding the product so well. :)

				I am really curious how they get to this level of stealth...can&#039;t imagine :o<br />Or does the buyer just rip it open and throw everything in the air and happen to live in a hoarder-type residence?

				@nibbler2029 Imagine if you bought a couple of LSD blotters. They are just small squares of paper, smaller than a centimetre squared, right? They could have been easily slipped between the outer surface and the bubble wrap of a jiffy bag if someone had applied a small razor slit to the bag.<br /><br />I&#039;m only speculating here, but I imagine it&#039;s easy to hide stuff like that very well.

				no answer for you but congrats on your super-stealth, which is what we all want (except for dumbasses who can&#039;t find the stash!)

				Yeah, personally if I&#039;d ordered something and it appeared to be an empty packet I&#039;d strip that packet down to the nth degree to be sure before making a complaint.

				Tell the customer to message SR staff if you really want to however, only one is not going to have a negative effect on your account especially if you have a lot of good reviews.

				Still, if the dude has found his product hidden in the package and things ended amicably there should be no reason for you to have bad feedback. In fact you should have good feedback for good stealth.<br /><br />I&#039;d mention it to SR Support and maybe they can cancel the original negative feedback now that you are both happy with the deal.

				Hey thanks for all of the advice! I just messaged SR support so hopefully they can fix any problems that may occur. It wouldn&#039;t be too big of a deal but I am a brand new vendor and this was just my 2nd transaction so I would like all the good feedback I can get :) <br /><br />And the stealth is def good, but no reason to think a scam has occurred.Customer just had to be a little more thorough&nbsp; with his package search
