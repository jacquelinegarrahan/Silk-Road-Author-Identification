				I&#039;m wondering where I should ship to. My house has other people there that wouldn&#039;t appreciate suspicious packages showing up and would likely look inside to see the contents. Is getting a USPS PO box a good idea or should I try something like USPS? Should I get the box myself or have someone else get it under their name and if they do so will I be able to use it?

				Hmm I think USPS is the way to go over a box in the UPS store or fedex store only because USPS is federal and they have to go through so many federal channels to get packages and or their contents.&nbsp; But with a box at UPS or FedEx location, these are private not federal and can be subpoenaed&nbsp; quickly for packages.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is coming from 2+ years at an independent postal shop and after dealing with an order using fedex to get some stuff from cali, long story short the packages sent showed up at our safe drop with a police escort asking them to open it, they refused and are fine but still that was scary and never happened with usps.&nbsp; If you have a mom and pop postal shop around you and they have USPS boxes then use them!&nbsp; They are the best over actual post offices.<br /><br />Alternatively if you have a tiny little post office near you, this is also preferable to a large one with many many employees sorting mail (mail tends to get lost at these locations more frequently, I wonder why).&nbsp; At my post office the same 2 people sort mail every day, I&#039;ve never had a package lost in 3 years.&nbsp; Try to be as legit as possible with your po box, using your real name to open it is good as you can always add other receivers too it. Of course if you have a friend doesn&#039;t do substances that are considered illegal and willing to open it for you that is always great.

				I&#039;d never walk into a commercial location to pick up a package with a controlled substance in it. You might as well be walking into the police department.

				Why would anyone open your mail at home?&nbsp; You know that is illegal, right?&nbsp; Also, they would open because it is suspicious?&nbsp; I am amazed by the stealth the vendors implement here, it should not be suspicious at all.&nbsp; They open all your Amazon, ebay, thinkgeek, etc that shows up at your house?<br /><br />The only reason I can see this happening if you are 14 years old and all of a sudden getting a crap ton of mail.&nbsp; Then yes, that is suspicious and like any responsible parent, they would open it.
