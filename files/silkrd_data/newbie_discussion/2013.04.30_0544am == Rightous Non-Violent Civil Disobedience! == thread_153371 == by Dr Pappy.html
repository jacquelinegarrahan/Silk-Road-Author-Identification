				We, collectively, all of us, ARE UNDER ATTACK! Being hit head-on is our Captain and Leader, The Dreaded Pirate Roberts! Fighting along with him are his brilliant and hard-working colleagues! Behind them we&nbsp; all stand , the Travelers of the SR! <br />My Mates! Hoy! Hoy! Pick your spirits up off the deck! Hard as it is WE will come out on top! Why? Because Light, Truth, Justice, and Love always Prevails over darkness, deceit, injustice, and hate! Is there money involved? Absolutely Yes! Yes, but this is about a whole lot more than money, this is about Doing the Right Thing! This demonstration is about shining light on a twisted, deranged system that has remained veiled in darkness and secrecy at the expense of millions of good human beings for far too long! The insane drug laws and the political, social, and economic systems they create in the U.S. and most of the world,&nbsp; have wrongfully existed for going on 100 years. This insane system has done far more harm socially and individually than they could ever do good in a million years! We are all casualties of the War on Drugs! We must correct this bizarre system that eats up our resources, both economic and human. We show what is right by&nbsp; claiming and owning our right to fair trade, as we mature adults see fit; and this demonstration is invaluable! We must not give in! We must not bow down! We must do what is right by disobeying laws that are wrong! Righteous Non-Violent Civil Disobedience worked for Dr. Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi as they literally changed the world for the better! Welcome to the final Civil Rights Rebellion! <br />If these attacks are found to be from a competitor seeking to establish themselves in this market, obviously motivated by nothing other than the desire to make money; they are not with us, they are against us! ANY ATTACKERS ON THE SR SHOULD BE TREATED AS PERSONAL ENEMIES&nbsp; OF US ALL- ATTEMPTING TO STRIP AWAY OUR HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; DIGNITY AND ENSLAVE US FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL GAIN!! I DO NOT WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE SUCH AS THAT, AND I WILL BE NO ONE&#039;S SLAVE!&nbsp; I believe we will all be pulled tighter together rather than splintering apart by adversity! These are the times that try people&#039;s&nbsp; souls!
