				You are perfectly right, as different countries have different ways.<br /><br />Im in the US.. I used to use sites like bitfloor and blockchain, but of course theyr down and Ive been spending so much time reading the forums and checking out sites, but I just cant figure them out.&nbsp; Now im getting paranoid because I probably made accounts to about 7 diff bitcoin sites people have suggested but i cant figure them out for my life... Like localbitcoins...

				Yeah, I tried using localbitcoins. Unfortunately there is nobody close enough for me to meet up with, id have to drive like 2 hours. Forget that. Bitinstant is a good site but they are down temporarily. I emailed them about it and they said it should be back up in a couple days. So im just gonna be patient and wait.

				I wish I could be patient and wait, but I cant wait!&nbsp; Not when camp bisco is a month away and i need to stock up...&nbsp; I wanted shrooms, and because of this whole crash thing, I missed a few vendors listings.&nbsp; Its so frustrating, but what can we do?<br /><br />I usually use blockchain, which is sooo easy, but of course all these sites are down... Good luck man, and hopefully soon enough well all have our sites back

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
