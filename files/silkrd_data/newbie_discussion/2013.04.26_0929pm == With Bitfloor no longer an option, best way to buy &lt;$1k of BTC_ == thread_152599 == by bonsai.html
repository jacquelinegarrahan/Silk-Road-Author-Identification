				I used Bitfloor for my large purchases, but they went down earlier this week. Has anyone found a good way to exchange cash—wire transfer would be okay—for large amounts of BTC?<br /><br />Thanks for any tips ...

				I would use CampBX or bitstamp now that bitfloor is down. There are several ways to buy bitcoins with CampBX and you can do wires to bitstamp.. They&#039;re pretty reliable but I wouldn&#039;t leave my coins in CampBX, only use temporarily to get coins cuz they seem to cooperate with the feds, bitstamp is the opposite.

				Localbitcoins would be a good way if there is a seller in&nbsp; your area.

				Three words - Blue Sky Traders<br /><br />Their support has its own thread on the forum, and you can process amounts up to $8500. They have cash deposits at Bank of America or a wire service.

				Localbitcoins all day long, best deals if you find a cool coin dealer :)<br />as always, be careful though, strangers and cash transactions can be dicey!<br />Just make sure you meet at a place with lots of people and wifi<br />Good luck<br />~PB2k

				Since I&#039;m trying to get to 50 as soon as I can (my former account alias had 150 posts so when I had to make a change, I never thought a Newbie board would one day happen), can anyone familiar with Bitstamp tell me the fee. Bitfloor ranged from 1-3% and Bitinstant is 4% plus $4, both of which are acceptable.<br /><br />Regarding the recommendation of using Localbitcoins, I think I&#039;m too paranoid for face to face. ;)

				We sell BTC for moneypaks.&nbsp; Definitely risky business on the buyers part, as it&#039;s based solely on trust. However, it&#039;s a fast and effective way of getting btc without the long wait.&nbsp; Once you find a btc vendor you trust, you should stick with them.&nbsp; We also encourage our new customers to start out with small amounts until you build a trusting business relationship.&nbsp; Look up JumboMonkeyBiscuit when SR comes back up.&nbsp; We aim to stand apart from the rest with our top notch customer service, fast response times, excellent communication, and quick btc transfers.&nbsp; So far we have 100% customer satisfaction rate.&nbsp; We appreciate all those that have placed their trust in us.

				I can vouch for blue sky traders.&nbsp; Bitinstant is good for amounts &lt;$500,&nbsp; just because of the time frame, and it takes a less amount of confirmations on the transaction.&nbsp; Usually get the coin within 20 min.&nbsp; And JumboMonkeyBiscuit does have great rep on the forums... on my way to spam up 50!

Good for small orders, but I&#039;m looking for a big order method so I can just stock up and not go through the buying BTC process which gets me nervous.
