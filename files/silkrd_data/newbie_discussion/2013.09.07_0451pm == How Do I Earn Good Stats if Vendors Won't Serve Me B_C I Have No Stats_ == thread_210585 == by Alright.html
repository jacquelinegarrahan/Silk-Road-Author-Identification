				I have had the most frustrating 2 weeks. First, I find out I must wait a week to receive the bitcoins I bought and paid for. Then, after my coin is loaded onto my SR account and I &quot;start out small&quot; as the Dread Pirate Robert suggests, I&#039;m told that I will not be served because I have no stats and cannot FE. How do I get stats if I cannot get served?! In the meantime, the vendors that won&#039;t serve me also won&#039;t cancel my orders; causing me to have to wait another week to free up my coin and try again.<br /><br />I thought it might be a good idea to contact vendor before ordering to determine if they will serve me, but some vendor state that they don&#039;t want messages not pertaining to lost packages.<br /><br />Does anyone have advice on this?

				-Contact another vendor, some are happy to take new customers. note: do thorough research <br />-If the vendor you choose has exceptional feedback, consider offering to FE for your first couple of transactions. some will argue against this, but it gets the ball rolling<br />-also, if you&#039;re not already, i hope you are using kind words when dealing with vendors, as they manage tens of hundreds of orders daily and the last thing they need is getting bombarded with messages or negative energy :/<br /><br />hopefully this helps...<br />

				Research the vendors a lot.<br />If you have trouble finding someone that will sell you what you are looking for with low stats, maybe look for another product that you wouldn&#039;t mind having with a vendor that will deal with you.<br />In no time, you will have a few transactions built up, and will be good to go.

				Vendors will. My friend just joined 2 weeks ago and already made 3 purchases. He would have made 4 but 1 wanted him to FE and he said no.

				If you aren&#039;t worried about losing too much money, you can always FE. The problem with that is how easily a vendor can &quot;selective scam&quot; you if you FE. <br /><br />There is a &#039;digital download&#039; section that has $10 movies and what have you. If you need 5 transactions for a favorite vendor, it&#039;s not too horrible to download some extra stuff.

				There are a lot of vendors willing to work with newbies. Read the vendors profile before placing an order and message them about your status and if they are okay with you ordering from them.

Not wanting to make assumptions about where you bought your BTC; I will say that the big exchanges seem more secure as a newbie, but aside from being slow as fuck they require verification which compromises your anonymity, no matter what they say. Which is the worst thing possible on SR. Try localbitcoins. You can have your coins in under an hour, securely and totally anonymously, as the site has an escrow system like SR and requires no verification of information that can link you to purchases.

I knew there had to be a better way. I&#039;ve purchased from the same vendor 3 times. I couldn&#039;t understand why it took a week AFTER the money was already paid. According to them, only the 1st time takes a week, after that you&#039;re established and it takes a couple of days. Well, each time it took a week. When I planning to buy on SR, I 1st have to calculate the time required to get coin in my account. I&#039;m going to try your suggestion. Thanks again.

				Aside from &quot;because they can&quot; why do some sellers want you to FE?&nbsp; What danger are they in from a new user who won&#039;t FE?&nbsp; Do they worry that the first time buyer will never finalize at all and somehow that will ding their perfect rating?
