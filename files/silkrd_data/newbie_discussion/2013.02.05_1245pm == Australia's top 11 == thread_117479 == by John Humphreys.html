				For the test side in India... Warner, Cowen, Hughes, Khawaja, Clarke, Maxwell, Wade, Starc, Siddle, Pattinson, Lyon<br /><br />For the one day side... Warner, Watson, Hughes, Clarke, Bailey, Maxwell, Wade, O&#039;Keefe, Starc, Pattinson, McKay

				I know Maxwell is a controversial choice, but his first class stats are better than his list-A stats and it&#039;s always handy to have an extra spinner in India. I&#039;m also not convinced that Watson deserves to walk straight back into the side if he&#039;s not bowling. Also, I think Watson works better at the top of the order, so I would have him around as a potential back-up for Cowen or Khawaja if they crash and burn. <br /><br />I could understand if the selectors went with Johnson ahead of Starc... though in my opinion Johnson should only be picked if Watson is there to bowl, so that Johnson is covered if he has one of his off days.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see O&#039;Keefe given a go at the test level, but at the same time I don&#039;t want to see the test spinner being rotated every month so I think it&#039;s fair to give Lyon a bit longer to see if he can assert his dominance.
