				I think I can answer this Question myself but I&#039;d like to know whats true on this myth.<br /><br />Is it possible to pour acid on weed and than smoke it b having the same effects??<br /><br />my answer would be its not possible because burned lsd inhaled doesnt affect 1 at all, but i have heard those stories about trip weed so i want to know whats up with this.<br /><br />thanks

				If I&#039;m not correct, smoking it would destroy much of it... yet you may still get some into your body.<br /><br />It would be a big waste<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide#Reactivity_and_degradation<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25°C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37°C and up to a 40% at 45°C were observed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Clearly as the temp rises, more LSD is destroyed.

				I know that you definitely can&#039;t burn shrooms or the psilocybin/psilocyn starts to break down a few hundred Fahrenheit. I assume the same would happen for LSD.<br /><br />Myths get started all the time by dumb people who just spread misinformation.

				LSD is a very fragile molecule which breaks down very rapidly at temperatures much lower than is required for combustion, so it almost certainly wouldn&#039;t work at all; you would just destroy the LSD.<br /><br />I think myths like this pop up because unknowledgeable people have an odd feeling one day when they&#039;re smoking, and it reminded them of LSD and they would like a way to explain it away. But, well, our minds are strange with placebo effects and nostalgia and completely unphysical LSD associated flashbacks, so a different feeling can&#039;t always be explained away by what strain it is or whatever. Somehow it reminds of people who believe in ghosts.<br /><br />Could also be related to anti-drug propaganda trying to get people to believe that untrustworthy dealers spike their weed for mysterious unknowable reasons.

				What about vaporizing the LSD cannabis mixture. maybe on a low setting?<br /><br />either way, you could just drop the acid normally and smoke a bowl. I can&#039;t think of any good reason to combine the two physically&nbsp;

I mean, it degrades even at room temperature and raising the temp would probably have something like an exponentially increasing rate of degradation... What would be promising would be to try it in a very low pressure environment because that would change the boiling point relative to the temperature, though that might pose more issues as to how to consume it. It would be interesting to see if it would affect the duration etc as there would most certainly be a shorter come up.<br /><br />But yeah, for practical purposes just smoke the weed and eat the LSD!
