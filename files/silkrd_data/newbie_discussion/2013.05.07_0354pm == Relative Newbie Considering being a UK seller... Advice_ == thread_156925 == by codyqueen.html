				So I&#039;m fortunate / unfortunate enough to be a regular visitor to my doctor for various health issues.<br />Many of the meds I&#039;m given I end up not using and I have quite a surplus! Have been using SR under another alias for a while now and considering becoming a seller. A lot of the things I have are available here so I know there&#039;s demand.<br /><br />I have read the Seller FAQ but want to know if there&#039;s anything I should be aware of. Mainly the penalties (however minute) in being discovered to be supplying prescription meds. I doubt I&#039;d ever withdraw - just use the bitcoin to purchase.<br /><br />Also can anyone recommend the best way of getting the bond onto SR? Have used localbitcoin and bitbargain in the past. Is this the way to go?<br /><br />Sorry for stupid questions. Genuinely would like to learn!<br /><br />C

				I have an almost unlimited supply of 30/500 codeine / paracetamol, mirtazapine and sertrazine. I also have short dated tramadol as well as a metric tonne of dovobet (expensive psoriasis ointment - not sure how well that one will do?!) I get temazie&#039;s too but perfer vals. Vals are pretty much what I buy on here with a few others. Do you think that&#039;s worth opening a seller account for? I&#039;d never be a big trader but have a stash that I&#039;d like to exchange for things I actually need. I have others too but nothing I think anyone would want unless they were in the US and facing huge copay&#039;s / buying them without insurance. A lot of the meds I take are only available in their branded name form, hence why they cost so much to buy without insurance.<br /><br />Anyone know how the bond works? is it hedged so that if bitcoin crashes again there is no big loss? I think that&#039;s my biggest worry as 4btc at the current exchange rate is a lot for me to lose.<br /><br />
