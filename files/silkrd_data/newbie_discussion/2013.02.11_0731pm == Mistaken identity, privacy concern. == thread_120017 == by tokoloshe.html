				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;ve had order canceled on me.<br />This is of course their prerogative but the reason worries me.<br /><br />They say they think I&#039;m a competitor trying to find out their shipping method.<br />They say they themselves ordered from all domestic vendors to do just that.<br />And apparently they have kept track of the used return addresses. (Doesn&#039;t everyone use fakes?)<br />They say my address is so close to one of their competitors that it&#039;s &quot;quiet obvious&quot; to them that it must be me.<br /><br />What worries me is that they might be right in that there is someone near me selling on SR.<br />Revealing my personal information to a local vendor could have some very undesirable effects for me.<br />I would very much like to avoid this but unfortunately they are not willing to disclose the alias to me.<br /><br />In a way this might be honorable but I can&#039;t think of a scenario in which it could harm anyone by disclosing it to me privately.<br /><br />Not sure what I&#039;m trying to achieve with this form post.<br /><br />Maybe someone who understand my concern can validate it and possibly convince the vendor to do the right thing.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m overreacting?
