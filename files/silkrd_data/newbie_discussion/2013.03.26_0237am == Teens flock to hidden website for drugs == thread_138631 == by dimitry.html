				Interesting article, at this URL (http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1375568/teens-flock-to-hidden-website-for-drugs/), which i have copied here, in total.<br /><br />Teenagers as young as 16 are using the underground drug sales website Silk Road, the Fairfax Media Global Drug Survey reveals.<br /><br />The survey, which was the first to interview Australian users of Silk Road, found their ages varied from 16 to 89 and most were using it to buy more &#039;&#039;traditional&#039;&#039; drugs such as ecstasy and cannabis.<br /><br />About 6.5 per cent of users were age 16 and 17, which was the youngest age allowed to participate in the survey, said Monica Barratt, a research fellow at the National Drug Research Institute who analysed the results.<br /><br />Dr Barratt said she was surprised that the majority of people were avoiding the proliferation of new and untested drugs available.<br /><br />The most common drug people said they had bought was MDMA (ecstasy), followed by cannabis (pictured), LSD and cocaine.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;We are not seeing a lot of people who are choosing really weird drugs,&#039;&#039; Dr Barratt said.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;They are choosing the drugs they know.&#039;&#039;<br /><br />Dr Barratt will present the findings at the Australasian Drug and Alcohol Strategy Conference in Sydney on Wednesday.<br /><br />She said the survey raised the question of whether people were choosing to buy so-called &#039;&#039;legal highs&#039;&#039; - newly invented drug compounds that are often sold in adult stores and tobacconists - because other drugs were illegal.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;Maybe we can see the Silk Road as a kind of microcosm of what might happen if we lived in a world where all drugs were regulated,&#039;&#039; she said.<br /><br />Of the more than 2500 people who said they usually bought their own drugs, more than half had heard of Silk Road, the majority learning about it from media reports. However, even though many had looked at the site, only 184 had bought drugs.<br /><br />Dr Barratt said Silk Road, which operates through the so-called &#039;&#039;dark internet&#039;&#039; and uses an alternative currency, may not be that easy for people to use.<br /><br />More than 6600 Australians responded to the Global Drug Survey, making it the largest, most up-to-date survey of current drug users conducted in Australia. Its results are not representative of the broader population, as participants were more likely to be male, older and well off.<br /><br />Nearly two-thirds of people who had heard of Silk Road but chose not to buy drugs there said they already had adequate access to illicit drugs and about half said that they were worried about police or customs.<br /><br />Dr Barratt said dealers tended to promise the drugs would not be detectable because they are vacuum packed and sealed in &#039;&#039;stealth packaging&#039;&#039; but, anecdotally, it appears Australians have more trouble importing drugs than people in Britain and Europe, where boarders are more porous.<br /><br />About a quarter said they were concerned about being ripped off.<br /><br />The Australasian Drug and Alcohol Strategy conference at Luna Park begins on Wednesday and will be attended by police commissioners from every state and territory and New Zealand.<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s pretty obvious that people only use RC&#039;s because they either can&#039;t get the real thing or the real thing is too expensive. If I had a choice between meat and soya I&#039;d chose meat.<br /><br />Also makes sense that ecstasy is so popular on here. I take both (that and cannabis) but ecstasy can be a lot more harder to buy on the streets whereas everyone sells weed.

				The best aspect of the silkroad is the difficulty one must go through to actually access it. Verses a site such as craigslist, sr keeps people out that dont have the patience or the trust to even transfer usd to bitcoins. Minors will find drugs no matter if its locally or thru the net, where theres a will theres a way.

				If I recall correctly, NPR covered a story about a year ago. That&#039;s when I started using SR. I wasn&#039;t even old enough to drive when I conducted first purchase. I trust SR vendors compared to producers in the states (MDMA). On here verifying and ingredients are more dependable and safe!

				It&#039;s funny, but it was an article like this that first alerted me to SR. I ignored it for a while, but these articles kept on appearing in the news and radio. Just this morning there was an article about customs intercepting drugs that have been mailed. It was a brief grab on ABC radio. The constant talk in the media is what got it to the forefront of my mind to the point where i started looking for the SR, and the rest is history.<br /><br />Dimitry.

				I first heard about SR a couple of months ago when i did a google search &quot;how to buy drugs online&quot; (lol)... but couldn&#039;t find it and didn&#039;t know whether it was legit or not. It was just the other day i came across an article about that australian guy and i saw the name of the site again.. this time i persued&nbsp; and finally found the gold heh heh..&nbsp;

				I dont think SR needs teens flocking to it. Its more unwanted attention and trouble to those of us sensible enough to use this resource. <br />SR needs older people who have brains to keep this quiet but enough of us to keep it sustainable. Id keep this secret from anyone who is not like minded. Less attention and drama the better for the rest of us.

				All the lazy and stupid parents of those teens need to flock to monitor what their kids are doing on the computer and what they are getting in the mail. For fuck&#039;s sake I was in school when the mail came when I was a teenager. No way I could get a package without my nosey ass dad knowing about it.<br /><br />You can stand in the middle of your street and scream at drivers to slow down but that&#039;s no substitute for teaching you kid to watch out for cars. Too many idiots have kids.

				These types of articles are unavoidable so I don&#039;t sweat them too much.<br /><br />But the general idea of a bunch of kids buying on SR is definitely bad news.&nbsp; There is a lot of neuroscience evidence making it clear that your brain is much less capable of making appropriate decisions until it is fully developed at 18-20.&nbsp; The probability of these kids fucking up and compromising a vendor is significant.<br /><br />BTW if any newbies don&#039;t already know, supremesmoke is the best H #4 vendor in USA.

				Sorry I&#039;m a couple of weeks late, but I wanted to note that I disagree with the title of this article - but think it was ok after the title and first three lines. Unfortunately that&#039;s the only bit most people read.<br /><br />We only had a very small number of &#039;teens&#039; complete our survey who reported using Silk Road. Australian SR users in our sample were median age of 26 and a quarter were over 35. But those findings aren&#039;t as exciting for the newspapers it seems.<br /><br />Onlookers in my field (of Australian drugs researchers) were a bit surprised that people were buying cannabis through SR, when it is bulky and stinky, and is easy to get through traditional means. My response to these people was that I think Australians buying cannabis on SR are (1) interested in speciality products, e.g. different strains or qualities, that aren&#039;t easily available elsewhere, (2) want to avoid face-to-face marketplaces. Wondered if you guys had any thoughts on this?

				Ever since I learned about SR in November of last year...<br />I dropped almost all my available money into bitcoin, (mostly at 20$ a pop!) and, as a result am worth more than 7 times what I had. my bank is a hidden volume on an encrypted USB, and it feels fucking goooood.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **THANK YOU BASED ROAD**<br />But kids on here worry me. I studied web security, VPNs, browser lock-down, proxy config, GPG and AES/Twofish/Serpent encryption, and the ins and outs of tor and bitcoin safety/anonymity from every angle for months before I even considered participating in tor. I&#039;m worried the kidz are going to get too fucked up or get busted because of stupid mistakes...and seriously... if my friends and i had something like this in high school it would&#039;ve been BAD...lolol. but you know... in the end, SR represents true market freedom which is beautiful. and high schoolers deserve to be a part of it too, and Im sure will eventually make up vital components of the community. Just be safe out there kids. don&#039;t wander too far down the rabbit hole :)

				I agree with the sentiment of being nervous about teen users. Personally I don&#039;t think one should do drugs until 18 or even 20, your minds gotta be the right place. You&#039;ve gotta be mature too, so you don&#039;t get caught by LE or anything. What I&#039;m worried about isn&#039;t even just &quot;teens&quot; because of their age, it&#039;s this younger generation, these Millenials, because they don&#039;t seem to give a fuck about privacy or secrets and have the complusive need to always be showing off through shit like Facebook and youtube. Plus, after years of telling people it&#039;s coming, techno and raves are finally becoming the music of the future and with that comes the popularization of drugs. I love drugs, but I hate when some 19 punk is like &quot;WHERE IS DA MOLLYZZZ!?!?! XD GUISE I CANT FIND MOLLYZ!!!&quot; bringing attention and association drugs will make raves and techno look bad. I mean it was the same thing we had for rock and roll, but it&#039;s different with the internet, word spreads quicker and LE and concern parents find out sooner -- ultimately causing a guilt by association affect and making it harder to cover our asses. <br /><br />Kids need to learn Rules #1 and #2 and keep their fucking mouth shut. There was a thread around somewhere talking about how non-users were blabbling about the road. You should only talk about or tell people if they are drug users and/or would be interested in using SR themselves. We don&#039;t need dumbass 16 year olds in here, these millennial ruin everything.
