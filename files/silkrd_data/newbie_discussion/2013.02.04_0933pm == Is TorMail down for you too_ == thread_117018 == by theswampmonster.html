				I&#039;m having a heck of a time getting onto my TorMail account right now.&nbsp; I cannot access it via SquirrelMail, RoundCube and get some odd error message when I click signup for a new account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone else having issues at this point?<br /><br />I e-mailed their admin and awaiting a reply.&nbsp;

				Yup.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe they&#039;re running some server maintenance... or who knows what?

				Thanks for checking, NickNack.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s too bad they don&#039;t put out any information on their site as I see the last update was last year.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve got some BTC&#039;s sitting in my e-mail so I&#039;m hoping this doesn&#039;t take too long.&nbsp; It&#039;s already been a couple of hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone else confirm issues logging into their TorMail?&nbsp; I can get to the site OK but nothing seems to be working as it should.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Yeah that&#039;s the error I get too when I try to use Roundcube to login.&nbsp; <br /><br />When using SquirrelMail it says:<br /><br />ERROR:<br />ERROR: Connection dropped by IMAP server.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just keep sitting tight and hoping they get this fixed up soon.&nbsp; Will update with any e-mail I get from their admin.&nbsp;

				I just signed up for an account, but one thing that struck me was, why is TorMail any more trustworthy than Gmail, Hotmail, AOL or any clearnet mail site?&nbsp; I sent a message to the TorMail administrators, asking them how they pay for their server or rackspace, electricity and bandwidth.&nbsp; I never got an answer, and this was over 3 months ago.&nbsp; I understand why we can trust SRM messaging (even though you should PGP encrypt your address, in case the SR server is confiscated by law enforcement), because DPR is motivated to evade law enforcement for fear of arrest, but does anyone know who all is behind TorMail or how they pay for the purported service they are providing us?
