				I just want to vent that some people on these forums or SR think they are better than others because the are &quot;so established&quot; and deny me samples and stuff. Well I been in the drug game since 1992 selling REAL RAW dope. SO be mindful never to judge people just by their status. I can be a great loyal customer but it works two ways.<br />Thanks

				&nbsp;I&#039;ve been in the scene since 89 myself. You got to realize the new generation isn&#039;t like we had it before cell phones/computers. It was all door to door back then and if someone ripped you off you retaliated... So it just did&#039;nt happen too often. You have to consider there point of view. There&#039;s guy&#039;s online full time suckering these guys out of free samples with no intentions of ever buying anything.<br />&nbsp; It works both ways. People get shiestier every year.

				I don&#039;t understand your thinking. You are a big player yet you won&#039;t throw out $10-15 or 20 for a sample of something you might buy in quantity? From a vendor&#039;s point of view how serious is someone who wants something for nothing? Either you get a review whore who will do anything for a freebie or competitor who will rip whatever you have to muddy the water. Personally I throw out X amount for a small amount first to see what it is really like dealing with that vendor. Do I want to be part of the free sample group? Absolutely not! As a buyer you want to purchase when the vendor is not on his toes and best behavior for that week when he is sending out free samples.
