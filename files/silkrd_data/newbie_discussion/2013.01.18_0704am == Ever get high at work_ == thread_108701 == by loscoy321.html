				While working in remote areas of this beautiful world doing exploration, I have been known to smoke a bit of weed to make the physical labour more enjoyable. <br /><br />I once was fired from a mountain for smoking and drinking a bit(bit being very relative, small for me, too much for most :P)

				I used to deliver pizza. Plenty of nights I would bring some pot to work to smoke on the longer deliveries. I sorta started going through my stuff a lot faster than I&#039;d like, so I made it a rule to leave my shit at home and only smoke if I had a delivery going right past my house. I worked construction for a while, rough carpentry mostly. We got high all day at work there. I&#039;m pretty sure the boss didn&#039;t know about it, but it was the kind of mom and pop company that probably wouldn&#039;t have cared that much. When I was a welder that was the best because the castings we welded smelled so fucking bad that you could be smoking a joint right behind someone and not notice. Now I manage a restaurant and if its a shitty day and I want to burn I&#039;ll just take a delivery and make up some excuse about needing to run out and get soap for the bathroom or some bs.&nbsp; &nbsp;So to answer your question, yeah, I sometimes get high at work.

				i&#039;ve had a number of different jobs in the past, all of which i would grow to hate eventually.&nbsp; so when the apathy kicks in and the hate starts to fume, i found that a whole variety of chemicals would follow me to the workplace on my commute.&nbsp; in addition to the daily caffeine and nicotine would be the following:&nbsp; alcohol, coke, weed, acid, meth, molly, and my favorite, ketamine.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been at the workplace under the influence of all of these, in various combinations, and get paid for very shoddy work.&nbsp; sometimes it&#039;s amazing how long it takes for people to notice.&nbsp; from my experience, they usually don&#039;t pay too much attention b/c they&#039;re busy with their own things.&nbsp; remember, it&#039;s better to get fired than quitting ;)

				long time ago I smoked every morning on the way to work a joint in the car. I think in this time I smoked the whole day. But I have taken also speed, coke, codein (was a try, not my world). Nowadays only from time to time some coke. The horror was one event at the court, the night before I snorted coke till in the morning, I think 14 h - the visist at court was a horrortrip.

				I was a pizza delivery guy for several years. Smoking weed got me through a lot of days. I smoked weed while driving on delivery, pretty much everyday. Most of my managers smoked too and I smoked weed with them a lot as well. I also gave/sold some of them mushrooms haha, make some extra cash doing that.<br /><br />I also went to work one time on acid. That was interesting. I was paranoid I was going to get robbed on every delivery (i worked in the hood) even though I was getting tipped. I could also see the aura around my manager, there was like a bright white light around him. Good times!!

				One time...I ended up sitting down, ready to do my job. When out of nowhere one of my coworkers came up to me and said, &quot;Hey, how do you like it?&quot; I was so confused, then the thought that he knew I was high, and he was asking about my drug use, popped up in my head. I ended up staring at him, with my mouth gaping open like a fish...(My mind was fried.) Then another coworker came up to us, and pointed at the new air conditioner that was placed right by my desk. The key word is new. It turns out we got a new air conditioner that day. I&#039;m pretty sure the second guy knew I was up in the clouds. My eyes were blown wide, it would be impossible to miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;::) Whoops. If it&#039;s any consolation, I wasn&#039;t supposed to work that day.

				Never at work, but I would get high (weed) at lunch then go to work (construction). <br /><br />About 10 years ago I got high at school and that was one of the worst ideas my friends and I had. We didn&#039;t dress during P.E. and had to sit way out in the field where there were no people. So, we decided to smoke a bowl and unfortunately that day everyone had to run 2 miles and sure enough as we&#039;re smoking the teachers and class came up behind us from an alley by the stadium and everyone saw and smelled what we were doing, lol.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Luckily none of us were expelled, but boy were we in a lot of trouble.&nbsp; :-[

				At a grocery store I used to work at, I would often smoke weed on the way to work, and occasionally go for a quick drive on break/lunch to toke up. Made the long shitty nights better. Also, 1.5 tabs of LSD showed me that work is not the place for such an experience. It was almost like a mental breakdown, and it was stressful remembering a customer&#039;s order(worked in the deli with slicers etc.). When washing my hands in between customers, it was like I would fall out of reality and forget what I was doing then go back and keep working on the order(tangent-thought). A bump of heroin in the cooler one day made me enjoy talking and working with coworkers too:D

				Used to work with a total stoner. he kept weed in his desk drawer which I found once looking for paperclips. we had a basement in our building. the basement used to be the safe for a bank in NY from 1850 or something like that. the 10,000 lbs doors were still there...to be continued I need the 50 posts...

				so we go into the safe close the safe door and hotbox that place with a fatty for lunch. I only did it once with my buddy. obviously he did it all the time. I&#039;m pretty sure he smoked out with everyone who worked there and was cool with smoking. Matt was a cool kid. I wish I had stayed in touch with him. <br /><br />At another job, a guy passed out right at his desk. everyone knew what was up, OD on coke. that&#039;s the life you lead. <br />&nbsp;<br />Have worked with loads of guys telling me stories from the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s. Professional people, who would do the craziest shit. hookers in the office for a manager&#039;s birthday, go out for a 3 hour business lunch and either come back drunk as fuck or all coked up. I&#039;m telling you, the older guys were way crazier then we are...and we have easy access to SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />And no I didn&#039;t work in a drug house. All these stories are from professional offices where I wore a suit to work everyday. Those white flakes on your dad&#039;s suit wasn&#039;t dandruff.

				Doing contract work for large firm, had to run some errands at lunch which took me past a friends house. I popped in to say hello and ended up sharing a few bong hits. I thought..... old dudes at work... probably they&#039;ll have no idea. WRONG.... Quite a few were ex-stoners when I came back they took one look at me and started taking the piss, HEY LOOK EVERYONE, BRUCE IS STONED... HA HA... HOW YOU FEELING BRUCE?&nbsp; PARANOID?.... HAHAHA. There was no trouble but I never did that again.

				Smoking before and during work is awesome.&nbsp; To me it distracts me and fascinates me more so my days go by quicker.&nbsp; Cant smoke and go to class tho, thats just disaster for me.

				ha just remembered another story.<br /><br />So this is an after work story, but it was with colleagues. We&#039;re all at the bar for after work drinks, think some guy was in town from another office and we were showing him a good time or some shit. Anyways, my MANAGER, a well respected older guy wife kids suburbs, the whole deal, asks me &quot;hey XXXXX, let&#039;s go get some drugs.&quot; I&#039;m like, shit how should I play this? I never talk to him about drugs before, he&#039;s my manager, he could be setting me up. Instead my dumbass says &quot;yea, let me make a call.&quot; An hour later my friend is at the bar. I get all kinds of shit from him, weed, coke, X, whatever. I think I actually had a moment of clarity when I only bought an 1/8 of bud from him and went back to hanging with my manager. I go to the bathroom, roll a J and then at the end of the night, we smoke the J around the corner of the bar, before he takes his train back home to the suburbs. Laughs were had by all. I&#039;m thinking it was a smart move on my part that I didn&#039;t introduce this over the hill geezer some some harsher stuff. Or maybe not. Maybe he would&#039;ve been hooked on shrooms and then I would&#039;ve taken his job from him.

				I don&#039;t think I went to work WITHOUT being on some kind of drug for quite a stretch. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend it, unless it&#039;s a fairly harmless drug and you&#039;re not working with heavy machinery. Shooting speedballs in the executive bathroom when you work in an office setting? Not a bright idea. Lesson learned, although it took a while&nbsp; ;)

				Used to crush up OC&#039;s and cut up lines on my desk.&nbsp; Luckily I have an office which can be locked.&nbsp; &nbsp;A long time before that I used to share an office with someone else so I used to bring the crushed up OC to work in one of those round blue pill crushers that you can get from Walgreens along with a short little straw and keep them in my pocket.&nbsp; Throughout the day I would go to the bathroom, go in a stall, unscrew the top of the pill crusher and take a little bump of the powder.&nbsp;
