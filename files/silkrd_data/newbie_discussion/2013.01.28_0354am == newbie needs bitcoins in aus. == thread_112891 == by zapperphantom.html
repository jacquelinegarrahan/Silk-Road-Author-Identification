				I&#039;ve used spendbitcoins a number of times without any problem.<br /><br />Follow the instructions on the website, deposit cash over the counter at a bank of your choice then wait for the bitcoins to arrive in your wallet. Pretty simple and as Wadozo said, it&#039;s completely legal.<br />

				On the order form from Spendbitcoins, you need to add the Bitcoin Address found under the ACCOUNTS tab on SR&#039;s Homepage. That is the Bitcoin address, not the Wallet address. Please note - After every transaction you make, clock on the &quot;GET NEW ADDRESS&quot; tab to receive a new address from SR. Use them once only. If you have coins left over in your account, they will still be there after acquiring a new Bitcoin address. The correct way of getting your coins and where to keep them is this - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; You should never transfer coins directly to your Silk Road E-Wallet just in case the site is ever taken down by LE or Hackers. If that happens, there would be a good chance your coins would disappear forever. You need to download a Bitcoin Client, either a Web based one or a Desktop one, and transfer your coins from where you buy them to this wallet. A good one to use is Electrum - http://electrum.org/ <br />Once you have this downloaded and installed, transfer your coins to one of the generated Bitcoin addresses. Then when your ready to make a purchase on SR, transfer the required amount of coins from your Client to your SR wallet containing your Bitcoin address. Always send a little more coin over in case of a price rise so you don&#039;t end up short when your ready to order. After every purchase you make on SR, request a new Bitcoin address. Using the same address more than once could potentially link you to more than one transaction should something ever happen to you. It&#039;s all about minimizing your risks, just in case something does go wrong.<br />Here is a link to a Bitcoin Exchange in Australia that has a detailed explanation on the different Bitcoin Clients available to be used. It outlines the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of each one so you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />This is a clearnet link -&nbsp; https://bitinnovate.com/need-a-wallet/&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
