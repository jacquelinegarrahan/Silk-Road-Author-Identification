				Hi<br /><br />I managed to buy a couple of things and they were delivered and all is well. I then came back on to the Road to finalize and leave feedback but I find my orders have disappeared and my bitcoin account is 0 (there was very little in it). <br /><br />Is this correct? My understanding was I had to finalize in order to complete the deal. I am now worried my vendors have not been paid.

				OK dude, so on Silk Road, click on &quot;account&quot; then on the right of your screen you&#039;ll have &quot;account links&quot; go to &quot;account history&quot;. There it should say whether recent orders have been finalised and, crucially whether your BTC has been withdrawn to a wallet that&#039;s not yours. Sounds like you may have been pished and like someone&#039;s finalized your orders and then withdrawn your bitcoin. So whilst your sellers will have had their coin, hopefully, you may have had your money withdrawn. That may not have happened but if you scroll through account history and also &quot;recent orders&quot; links then you should have a better idea of WTF is going on.<br /><br />Then change your password and pin code. Immediately.<br /><br />In future DO Not go on any silk road link that isn&#039;t the &quot;very big 5 inch Pizza&quot; as I call it, this one http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br /><br />Make sure you only ever log in to that one, memorize it - I keep mine bookmarked and go in via that.<br /><br />Don&#039;t create accounts at other online markets with the same credentials as you use on Silk Road.<br /><br />Good luck and let us know what happens.<br /><br />Reme x<br /><br />

				Thanks<br /><br />yes I did all that. Checked account history and recent orders and there is nothing there at all! No record of what I have done.<br /><br />I changed my password as soon as I saw this and I will now change the pin but ..........<br /><br />

				What about under &quot;Purchasing Stats&quot;?&nbsp; Anything?&nbsp; Are the buys there?<br /><br />Do you have multiple SR accounts?&nbsp; Maybe you&#039;re really high and logged onto the wrong one?

				No. I am not high and there is nothing under purchasing history. I am assuming all login names are unique. I only have one.

				So you have:&nbsp; (these are all separate tabs in your account page) <br /><br />0 &quot;purchasing stats&quot;<br />0 &quot;recent orders&quot;<br />0 &quot;Account History&quot;<br /><br />?<br /><br />

				How the fuck is this even possible? Weird. I&#039;d try talking to customer support in the main forum topics. Also wow, I didn&#039;t think about not using the same credentials on other sites as you use here. I just signed up to Atlantis with the same info. Ah well, I don&#039;t even use the account anyway... hopefully it won&#039;t be a big deal.<br /><br />Also I just recently learned that anything ending with &quot;.to&quot; is bad news. I accidentally clicked a .to link out of Google when I was searching for the URL. Now I just keep it bookmarked as well. Stay safe and I hope you figure out the problem! Keep us updated, I&#039;m really curious what&#039;s going on there....
