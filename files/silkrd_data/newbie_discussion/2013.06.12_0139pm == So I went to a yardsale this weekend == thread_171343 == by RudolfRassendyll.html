				[story unrelated to SR/drugs] And I was looking at all these books, a huge box full. Dude comes up and says &quot;Hey, I&#039;ll give you all of them for a dollar.&quot; I hadn&#039;t looked closely at them but I pretty much love books as much as drugs so readily agreed. I brought them home and they sat for a couple of weeks. I got to looking at them the other day and I found some interesting stuff.<br /><br />Mixed in with a bunch of religious nonsense are several (30+) first edition broadway script type things. Some of them quite well-known, like West Side Story, My Fair Lady, and The Diary of Anne Frank. Then there&#039;s a ton of Tennessee Williams, who I hadn&#039;t known about but found out he was a pretty cool beat-generation playwright. All of this shit is first edition. Upon consulting Ebay, it appears they could be quite valuable. To the toon of 50-100 dollars each.<br /><br />So I was pretty excited to sell them right away but I haven&#039;t yet. I can&#039;t decide if I really want to. I like the idea of the Tennessee Williams books staying in my personal library. And then again, I&#039;m not much of a theater-buff and I thought maybe I should take them to a playhouse and donate them. I mean, if they are really historical and valuable, they would certainly appreciate it better than I would. Also, just because they are listed by other people on Ebay for lots of money doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they are really worth that much. I have no idea how to sell them for the premium it seems they should be worth.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought I&#039;d share a story. It&#039;s basically a spam to 50 post but I thought I&#039;d put a bit more substance into it.

				Check the completed listings for the items you are searching for. It will show you which ones have sold, not sold and for how much. This option for search parameters is in the left sidebar under more refinements, and appears after you search.
