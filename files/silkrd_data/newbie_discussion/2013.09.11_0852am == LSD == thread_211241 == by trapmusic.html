				Hi,<br />I was wondering if the strength of an LSD trip only depended on the mcg. I&#039;ve taken acid several times and one time also from tesselated (it was intense, but just what im looking for) and now I wanted to get more so I went through the avengers thread and all the star vendors only offer 100-150mcg LSD except tesselated had 200mcg(maybe somebody with 350mcg but totally overpriced since i want to buy a sheet).<br />Because everyone is always saying &#039;clean&#039; acid so what else does it depend on? And i wouldnt think that somebody who only offers 100mcg is a star vendor since that is such a low dosage. <br />So can you suggest any vendor whose acid makes me trip as hard as tesselated even though the mcg are not as high?<br /><br />Sorry for the bad english but I hope you can read it.<br />Thanks

				that wasn&#039;t my question... like i said, i tried the ones from tesselated with 200mcg and thats exactly what im looking for but maybe there&#039;s some other acid with less mcg and so also a cheaper price which will make me trip just as hard. Or does it only depend on the mcg?

You would need a very good lab to find it out for you. <br /><br />Alaska says in his profile that some people believe that the LSD get&#039;s weaker or bad when it goes through the wrong hands, hands of people with the wrong intentions. I would say we live in a physical universe. ;)

				You can&#039;t really know how much is on a tab unless they&#039;re tested which is rare or you laid them yourself, but yes 150ug is a solid trip.

				I agree with TSX. You really never know how much you&#039;ll be getting when it comes to blotters. &amp; yeah, the mcg&#039;s are what gives it the effect......
