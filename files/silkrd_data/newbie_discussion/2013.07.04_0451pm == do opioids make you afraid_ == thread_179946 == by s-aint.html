				I&#039;ve noticed when using H/oxy/codeine/etc. I feel I&#039;m likely to develop this strange deep fear. If I&#039;m all alone, I have to avoid certain things like unfamiliar music, horror movies, anything connected to the supernatural, thinking about the &#039;shadow people&#039;, even just a picture of an alien from a movie or something. <br /><br />I swear it&#039;s like being a seven-year-old kid in the dark. I have to keep all my thoughts in check, keep my mind busy with light stuff like cartoons or whatever or I&#039;ll terrify myself. When I&#039;m not high, or if there&#039;s people around, I&#039;m not scared of any of that stuff like wtf

				That&#039;s really weird.. The only less common side effects I get sometimes are stimulation and edginess/irritability. I&#039;ve never heard of paranoia from opiates before, it&#039;s quite the opposite for me :P

				Tree: I&#039;ve experienced the same thing. I took upwards of 500mg (thankfully not anymore) of Vicodin a day for well over a year and it gave me a serious rush of adrenaline. Very odd. It&#039;s been almost a year since I&#039;ve been on that kind of dose, now if I take it ... it knocks my ass out. <br /><br />Paranoia... interesting, I&#039;ve never experienced that. However, our bodies are incredibly different so reactions, of course, will be very different. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s wise to assume you will ever have the same response/reaction to a drug as someone else. Regardless of how many people who have the same type of experience. <br /><br />Make sense???

				It&#039;s not really like drug-induced paranoia though; like when I get paranoid from uppers or weed, it&#039;s mostly &quot;oh crap other people can tell I&#039;m on drugs. am I acting weird? I should leave.&quot; it&#039;s very internalized, feels more like worrying and being anxious, but not actually scared.

				&nbsp;Not in my experience, but anxiety is definitely one of the withdrawal symptoms.
