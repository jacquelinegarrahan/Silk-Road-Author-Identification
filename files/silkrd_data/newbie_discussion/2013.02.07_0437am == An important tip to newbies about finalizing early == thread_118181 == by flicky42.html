				****This isn&#039;t a discussion of whether you should FE or not****<br /><br />IF you do decide to finalize early PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE wait before you leave your feedback. It may seem like you are required to rate the seller after finalizing early but you aren&#039;t. The rating and comment will sit in your &quot;orders&quot; tab until you are able to provide feedback.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the really popular sellers have pages and pages of reviews only saying &quot;FE for trusted seller&quot; &quot;FE will update&quot; blah blah blah. This destroys our review system since we can&#039;t immediately find out if a seller is still reputable or not. Waiting to provide feedback when you actually have feedback to give is the best way to solve this. Sometimes sellers go shitty and no longer ship out product even the best ones (e.g. tony76). The only way we can know is by seeing it clearly defined on the seller page and not covered in pages of bullshit feedback.<br /><br />-Flicky

				Maybe I&#039;m wrong but don&#039;t you have to submit feedback to FE? That&#039;s why so many feedbacks say &quot;Leave feedback here&quot; because it&#039;s the default. I don&#039;t think you can finalize otherwise...? I don&#039;t prefer to FE so would love if someone could clarify.

				@onetwothreee, I second your question..<br />Do finalizing early and leaving a comment go hand and hand? <br /><br />It&#039;s my understanding that if you finalize early and DO leave an immediate feedback.. you are able to go back into the feedback and modify it.. <br />Is there a limit on how many times it can be updated? you could keep potential buyers updated in process.. with your updated information<br /><br />I know vendors are freaked out with the finalizing early system but tracked packages for example sent in escrow should be safe for them...?<br /><br />I guess theres bad people on both side of the table though =(

				You don&#039;t have to leave feedback. I&quot;m not sure how to make this clear through text because people always seem to get confused when I explain it. You see &quot;leave feedback here&quot; because people are all confused.<br /><br />Next time you place an order FE and then just click a different tab and browse the road. The option to leave feedback will sit in your &quot;orders&quot; tab until you fill it out. <br /><br />It is NOT required to be done immediately.
