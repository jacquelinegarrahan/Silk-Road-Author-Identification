				Hello, My name is BioPyramid Health!<br /><br />I intend to start selling on here sometime soon.&nbsp; But only starting with 2 things first than progressing to my formulas I made myself to service the community of those in need.&nbsp; I test each product to verify quality.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am thinking charging .05 bitcoins for 290-300 capsules with Free shipping.&nbsp; But the listings each month will be limited.&nbsp; This is to serve those most in need, I thought about 1 bitcoin each but this way I can work for donations to those who are able to grow the Doctors business.&nbsp; The more donations the more listings ect......but will start slow probably for many months to wait for demand and ratings to build up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know what I am doing, I just need some advice for what container to ship the capsules, any ideas of something from walmart?&nbsp; Of course I might just use plastic baggies to start, but thought something with a Biopyramid Health label with the directions might be savy in the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am interested to know what you are selling, that would be a good starting point for everyone...<br />Are you an MD? How much trauma care experience do you have? What is your specialization?<br /><br />I have some questions ranging from bullet wound trauma care to biomechanics of the human body for martial arts.

				Herbs are only one tool to correct Biological imbalances within the human spirit.&nbsp; In Chinese Philosophy they teach humans used to have diseases of the spirit when we lived within nature.&nbsp; Correcting the spirit was all that was needed when humans were one with nature.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now Humans need to intake nature as well as heal the spirit.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be offering Hydrangea Root capsules, and Samambaia capsules to start.<br /><br />I calculated that I cannot serve everyones diseases just focus on the most prevalent.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I cannot give advice on trauma care, however I know martial arts philosophy and some biomechanics of the mind and body.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend the Samambaia for martial arts.&nbsp; Later I will offer a mental energy + longevity capsule.&nbsp; Gynostemma + Samambaia.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I will always offer Samambaia seperate for its Sunscreen ability.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you plan on growing lots of marijuana outdoors this summer think of Samambaia.&nbsp; It is a natural sunscreen that works and you need not wipe any chemicals on you.&nbsp; Just take it internally.<br /><br />

				I will be offering a a Cancer and fever/flu capsule.&nbsp; Using Anamu/Samambaia/Astragalus.&nbsp; Changing the ratios for the different cancer, weather skin or internal.&nbsp; Probably to be used in conjuction with a real doctor, just don&#039;t say hey doc I got Silkroad herbs ect.<br /><br />My experience is limited to infectous diseases, but a lot of the effective Rainforest herbs will not be as available soon.&nbsp; So I will be focusing on a few main areas that I will list below and being creative.

				Ok up and running.&nbsp; Account is ready to serve those in need.&nbsp; Listings should be up within the hour!&nbsp; Make me a fan please! <br /><br />For interested parties Hydrangea root is bar none one of the best Liver cleansers available.&nbsp; Samambaia is very calming and mentally active.&nbsp; Protects skin cells and brain cells.&nbsp; Natural suncreen as well if you live in the desert or in the sun a lot.<br /><br />

				Ok I was going to bite my tonge but this BioPyramid is a nut. First of all don&#039;t go around calling yourself a Doctor trying to practice medicine when you don&#039;t have a medical degree, your no md. 2nd go try to sell your snake oil somewhere else. You should be ashamed of yourself trying to tell people they can treat life threatening liver disease and cancer with bullshit herbs. There&#039;s a reason that shit you mentioned doesn&#039;t pass double blind medical trials, IT DOESN&#039;T WORK! It&#039;s modern day snake oil and your a modern day snake oil salesman/conman. Makes me sick.<br />
