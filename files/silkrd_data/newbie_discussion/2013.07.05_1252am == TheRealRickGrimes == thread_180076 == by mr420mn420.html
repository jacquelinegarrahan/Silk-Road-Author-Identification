				Has anyone heard about TRRG asking customers to FE because he was going on vacation? Around 50 people are all wondering where their packages are.&nbsp; Has anyone ever heard of a successful vendor with an established customer base, most of them were happy to Fe for him.&nbsp; Its just seems like throwing away a great thing for a couple grand? It seems odd...

				It was all customers, people would vouge (SP?) for him- I have had dealings with him and he was 100% legit, package was shipped same day. He has over 300 successful transactions, I just dont understand why you would throw away a successful business for a few grand, from looking at his orders he should make that in a day or 2.&nbsp; But I am sure that 50 people giving him a 1/5 should be enough to keep others from falling for this. I honestly hope that its all a great big misunderstanding and all the orders are filled. He was the first person I did business with, and a few after that, I just dont want to believe that he would&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone hears anything about him or the &quot;situation&quot; with the over 50 FE&#039;s please let me know.&nbsp;
