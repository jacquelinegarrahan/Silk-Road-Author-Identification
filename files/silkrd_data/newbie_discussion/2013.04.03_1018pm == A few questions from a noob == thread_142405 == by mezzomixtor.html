				Hello everybody!<br /><br />I am totally new to TOR and therefore I am still a bit insecure. Could somebody help me out with some questions? <br />I have my TOR Browser Bundle on an portable USB-Drive and encrypted it with TrueCrypt. Additionally I made a new account on my computer with Windows and only use this account when connecting with TOR. After every session I clean my system with CCleaner. Is this a half-decent way to surf anonymus on the deep web? Or do you have any other tips for me? (I guess this question has been asked hundreds of times before, so it would be great if you would just give me some keywords/hints, i would do research by myself of course) <br /><br />And is it safe if I safe my bookmarks right in the TOR-Browser? As the folder is on my encrypted portable USB-Drive, i would assume it is? Or are there still some &quot;1kb-files&quot; hidden in Windows when I safe them right in the browser? Thanks for the help in advance, and sry for my broken english!<br />

				Sounds like your super paranoid.&nbsp; With TOR my understanding is you just need to delete it to get rid of everything to do with it, so whether it&#039;s on an encrypted hard drive, which could probably be broken into by LE or not is a bit irrelevant.&nbsp; If your only buying personal use amounts I&#039;d relax and just enjoy the experience of SR.

				Thanks for your answer, and yes, i am really super paranoid :D but i think its better to be super paranoid than super naive :) i just want to buy small amounts for personal use, and my thoughts are that my ordered package will get seized and suddenly cops are in front of my door and start searching my house. Does btw anybody know how safe it is to order a package within the EU? Are there drug-dogs in usage or just random samples being taken? My biggest thoughts are that the parcel will get seized, because the biggest weakness is that i have to reveal my real address

				As far as leaving bookmarks within the browser, it MAY not be an issue. But, if it were I, just make a wordpad on your encrypted flash drive and put URL&#039;s there. However I WOULD NOT save passwords or usernames. Chances are if LE was to break into your flash drive, having the URL to certain places wouldn&#039;t really be too incriminating (considering they will be seeing that tor is installed there and w/e else). Having the registration information for those sites, just might be and could possibly lead into getting others into hot water. I also like the thought of using micro sd&#039;s. If need be, pop it in your mouth and crunch that fucker into 20 pieces lol. You sound like you at least are trying to be safe and doing a decent job of it. ALWAYS check the forums though for recent LE activity or new ways to keep yourself safe.

				I would suggest you contact your vendor of choice and ask what kind of packaging they use.&nbsp; they won&#039;t tell you what the stealth is I suspect but they should be able to tell you how many times they bag it and what types of bags they use.&nbsp; You could even ask them about their failure rate for delivery through europe.<br /><br />I&#039;d also suggest you go for a look through the forums, particularly the security one.&nbsp; you&#039;ll get an idea of the ideas bandied around and why packaging is done a certain way.&nbsp; It will make you much more comfortable when you go to ask the vendor (if they haven&#039;t already posted in one of the threads there about upgrading their packaging).&nbsp; You could even go check out their review thread if they have one as there may be some information there.<br /><br />I doubt many vendors these days are sloppy enough to just to chuck it in a bag but it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry.

				ok guys thanks for the help :) and haha thanks for the good tip with the micro sd :D but i just bought a new usb flash drive only for using tor, at least its very small so if LE is at my place i could easily get rid of it! ^^ i think i&#039;ll just read through the forum a little bit more and then place my first order!

				You&#039;ll be alright dude. <br /><br />Welcome to the Road. Read up on the security section really.<br /><br />Been making purchases for over a year now and I haven&#039;t had problems. Just stick to personal amounts :)

				linux/windoof/mac, OS doesn&#039;t really matter at all really, everything to do with SR is at browser level.<br /><br />I would advise against keeping bookmarks for any URLs to do with SR though, it&#039;s not hard to memorise really once you&#039;ve typed it in from memory really.<br /><br />Best thing you can do is communicate with your vendors and generally order from vendors who are closer to you, that way your package crosses fewer borders.

				Also, when you do find someone you trust and has done you well, stick with them. It is tempting to vendor shop for cheap prices or a promise of good quality. But, trust is the name of this game. I am actually quite surprised at how legit people seem to be. There are however bad apples on every tree.&nbsp; :P

				ill take a look at virtual machines (yet i dont know anything about it, i hope its not too hard to learn) and what do you mean with socks and proxy?&nbsp; additionally to tor? isnt tor safe enough to surf in the deep web? thank you!<br /><br />and one last question: <br /><br />I just read through the silk road wiki to gain more information about bitcoins, but some things are still unclear. I guess every bitcoin-address looks the same (even the ones from legal websites) and therefore its not possible to see where my bitcoin-address leads to when i give it to a bitcoin trader. so the bitcoin-trader does not know that he is sending my bought bitcoins to silkroad. and the only way to find out that my bitcoin-address is the one from silkroad is to look into my silkroad account, am i right?<br /><br />i just made an account on localbitcoins.com and found a trader close to my location, so i guess im going to buy bitcoins from him cash to bitcoin as it seems to be the safest way (no name or banking account number)
