				American and western women have been demanding equality. Well, why don&#039;t they demand that MEN should get custody of the children 50 percent of the time? As it stands, women get custody of the children after divorce 90 percent of the time.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t women DEMAND that 50 percent of alimony and child support payers should be WOMEN? As it stands, 99 percent of alimony and child support is men paying it to women. Why shouldn&#039;t 50 percent of WOMEN pay alimony/CS to men, especially now that women on average are making more money than their husbands? Do you women really not see the massive hypocrisy here?<br /><br />Or what about the draft, selective service? Why aren&#039;t women demanding that WOMEN should also be forced to register for the military draft?<br /><br />Frankly, until women become 50 percent, EQUAL, of the following six categories, all their claims for equality is nothing but bullshit:<br /><br />War dead - 98% men<br />Workplace dead - 93% men<br />Incarcerated - 90% men<br />Homeless - 90% men<br />Alimony payers - 99% men<br />Child support payers - 99% men<br /><br />Is anyone else here sick and tired of the constant bullshit, lies, and hypocrisy of American and western women?<br /><br />As for myself, I don&#039;t even bother with them anymore. I only date Asian women now. And I can tell you, Asian women are a 100 times better than American/western women. Asian women are still feminine, submissive, humble, affectionate, chaste, loyal, etc.<br /><br />American and western women can&#039;t compete with Asian women, which is why they are trying to ban or limit western men from marrying them. Look at Sweden. The most feminist country on earth. It also has the highest number of Thai wives than any other country. One Swedish feminist politician was saying that Sweden needs to make a law limiting the number of women from Thailand that Swedish men can marry.<br /><br />LOL! You white women are so big strong and independent, and you feel threatened by a bunch of Asian women? No, you women are NOT &quot;big strong and independent and liberated&quot;. You are a bunch of cowardly little girls with very low self esteem.

				I&#039;m done with selfish, angry and greedy American women who do not appreciate men who are average looking, hard working, kind individuals just trying to share a happy and healthy life with a woman they want to treat well.

There are a lot of issues with American women, but that&#039;s just a typical stereotype. I prefer having an opinionated and critical thinking partner, not a daughter to take care of, pamper, etc.

				American women, get used to living alone, or else become a lesbian. If you hate men so much, you might as well just come out of the closet and become a lesbian whore.<br /><br />Have you American women ever heard of the word &quot;misandry&quot;? It is the exact opposite of misoginy. It means hatred of men. And feminism and misandry are the same thing.<br /><br />Anyway, American women are either too stupid or too arrogant to admit to themselves and to the world that they have been brainwashed by the feminist western culture. So, good luck finding a husband, because most western men no longer want women like the typical American sluts. Your arrogance is the BIGGEST TURN OFF.<br /><br />So, get used to living alone with your 10 cats, or else become a lesbian. Those are your two options, American women!

				Why is it up to a disadvantaged section of society to take up the rights fights for the most privileged?<br /><br />Men, being the overwhelming bulk of politicians, judicial system, media, and big money ownership, are perfectly positioned to fight for themselves.<br /><br /><br />BLACK PEOPLE - WHY DON&#039;T THEY FIGHT FOR MY RIGHT TO BE &quot;WHITE AND PROUD&quot; WITHOUT BEING RACIST?

				Marrying an American woman is the dumbest thing a man could ever do. Save your money and marry an asian woman or a eastern European woman. You won&#039;t be disappointed. At least a foreign woman isn&#039;t going to divorce you as quickly and easily as an American woman, and most of them make great moms. Hell, most of them will cook for you and enjoy it, too. American women are pathetic. American women are easy to hate, they are stupid, ignorant, and arrogant and now they&#039;re even going broke. What&#039;s there to like about them?

				And American women are losing the cream of the crop - good and caring men - who would rather take their generosity elsewhere. My dating profile looks something like this:<br /><br />Fun, well educated, adventurous family man with a keen sense of humor seeks warm, fun, and adventurous lady for dating, romance, travel, and if we click, marriage. American women please do not respond. I have no desire to lose my hard earned assets, family and children to an entitled America woman who can and most likely will (see national divorce rates) take it all away at her slightest whim (see www.nomarriage.com ).<br /><br />However, I will enjoy giving my romance, fun, adventure, kindness, warmth, support, and generosity to a kind hearted, warm spirited, fun, adventurous foreign lady with a sense of humor who understands that building a family and a great life is hard work for both of us, and at the same time the most rewarding thing we’ll ever do together! Seeking warm, kind, adventurous foreign lady who enjoys family, romance, travel, and children to join me in adventure and to help create a warm and happy family for the best years of our lives!

				I don&#039;t agree with the OP&#039;s rationale, but I have indeed found foreign women to be much more approachable and less arrogant than American women. Sure, all people and cultures have their problems, but there is something about growing up in the first world that warps people&#039;s heads. I have to laugh at my feminist friends. I, too, support women&#039;s rights and the fall of patriarchy, but good lord, you know who really needs feminism? Saudi Arabia. East Africa. South America, where machismo still reigns in many parts. Looking at the big picture, women have it made in America. I&#039;ve always said that women should not aim to be equal to men; that&#039;s a pretty low standard if you ask me.

				lawl, JohnRambo thinks top quality men can save themselves money and time by dating SE Asian women. If someone is so bitter and rejected that they have to go to developing countries and pay women who don&#039;t speak English to fuck them and cook them dinner that says it all. Dude, have fun with that.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Feminists do not want you to lose custody of your children. The assumption that women are naturally better caregivers is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want you to have to make alimony payments. Alimony is set up to combat the fact that women have been historically expected to prioritize domestic duties over professional goals, thus minimizing their earning potential if their &quot;traditional&quot; marriages end. The assumption that wives should make babies instead of money is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want you to be lonely and we do not hate &quot;nice guys.&quot; The idea that certain people are inherently more valuable than other people because of superficial physical attributes is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want you to have to pay for dinner. We want the opportunity to achieve financial success on par with men in any field we choose (and are qualified for), and the fact that we currently don&#039;t is part of patriarchy. The idea that men should coddle and provide for women, and/or purchase their affections in romantic contexts, is condescending and damaging and part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want you to be maimed or killed in industrial accidents, or toil in coal mines while we do cushy secretarial work and various yarn-themed activities. The fact that women have long been shut out of dangerous industrial jobs (by men, by the way) is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want you to be drafted and then die in a war while we stay home and iron stuff. The idea that women are too weak to fight or too delicate to function in a military setting is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists do not want women to escape prosecution on legitimate domestic violence charges, nor do we want men to be ridiculed for being raped or abused. The idea that women are naturally gentle and compliant and that victimhood is inherently feminine is part of patriarchy.<br /><br />Feminists hate patriarchy. We do not hate you.<br /><br />If you really care about those issues as passionately as you say you do, you should be thanking feminists, because feminism is a social movement actively dedicated to dismantling every single one of them. The fact that you blame feminists—your allies—for problems against which they have been struggling for decades suggests that supporting men isn&#039;t nearly as important to you as resenting women. We care about your problems a lot. Could you try caring about ours?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Source (worth reading in its entirety): http://jezebel.com/5992479/if-i-admit-that-hating-men-is-a-thing-will-you-stop-turning-it-into-a-self+fulfilling-prophecy
