				Depends on the definition of &quot;worst,&quot; but in my opinion, morphine, because even though it made everything feel sooo good, it&#039;s just not what I&#039;m about.&nbsp; I can see the appeal for opiate users, but I&#039;d much rather take a walk through the woods on acid or shrooms and let my imagination take me to another world, than to sit on a couch for a few hours doing nothing, even if it does feel absolutely blissful.<br /><br />User below me: Tell us the story of the experience that got you into your DoC

				I&#039;ve never taken MDMA, but I&#039;d probably prefer a private setting with friends (especially the first time).<br /><br />Would you rather have pizza with french fries on it or have chips flavored like pizza?

				As far as I can tell, this life is not a computer simulation, but something sort of like it.
