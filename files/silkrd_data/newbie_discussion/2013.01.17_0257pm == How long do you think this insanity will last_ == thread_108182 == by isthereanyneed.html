It&#039;s gonna take some more effort though. <br /><br />I can&#039;t see any other use for this either, I&#039;ve seen people with loads of post writing about nonsense or asking questions that have been asked many times before and I&#039;ve seen very helpfull people (who only pos lab results every now and then, for example) who have only ten or twenty posts.
