				ordered: July 29, 2013, x:xx pm UTC<br /><br />2 days later have not heard a thing from vendor and order is still &#039;Processing&#039; despite the fact that QPD has &#039;last been seen:today&#039;<br /><br />Feedback shows he has done some good deals in the past, but latest (July 30-ish) seems flakey and un responsive.

				update: he msg&#039;d me a day before the &#039;Cancel&#039; function would have been available telling me reasons for the delay.<br /><br />He then put my order in transit, apologized, and said he was planning to toss in some extras for the problems.<br /><br />Should receive order in a day or two and will update thisi thread if I remember.<br /><br />Very courteous message sent by QPD, let&#039;s see if actions back it up.

				Well, it has now been 2 weeks and the &#039;Resolve&#039; button is available for me to tag my order as not delivered. This is the automated message I received from SR admin:<br />&quot;One or more of your shipments have not been confirmed in over 10 days . Please finalize any shipments that have arrived, or click &quot;resolve&quot; next to the ones that have not arrived. If you do nothing, your payment will be released to your vendor 17 days after your order was shipped.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff&quot;<br /><br />So, I&#039;ll wait until later today, after the mail has arrived, to &#039;Resolve&#039;.<br /><br />If I look at his vendor page, I see that 11 people DID receive their order (mostly the same product as I ordered) so I&#039;m a bit bummed about not receiving it and don&#039;t understand why.<br /><br />It was sent via Priority according to the Order ticket, so if he has DCN, he will have to provide it to SR during resolution. I have asked QPD for DCN 3 times with no response.<br /><br />hexdef

				I put my order (about $90 USD) in for &#039;resolution&#039; yesterday. I&#039;ve never had to do this before so I will report on the outcome.<br /><br />So far, after clicking &#039;Resolve&#039; on the order summary page, one gets teh following options:<br />1. release payment = send the vendor all of the money in escrow<br />2. submit a &#039;refund % of item price&#039; = I put 100% since I have received no product but you could put (say) 50% if half your order was missing/lost etc...<br />3. -OR- as an alternative to #2 above, you can &#039;extend due date by xx days&#039; = in case you want to give the vendor more time to send shipment. In my case, it has been over 2 weeks and promises that the order was sent.<br /><br />The interface also notes that in 5 days:<br />&quot;The time before a Silk Road admin steps in and declares a final resolution. Please come to an agreement before this deadline. &quot;<br /><br />

				UPDATE: QualityPharmDelivery provided a full 100% refund less than 1 day after put in resolution.<br /><br />My verdict is that the order may have gotten lost in transit as he had about 10 other successful transactions around the same time as mine. So, sucks to be me....<br /><br />I think that other buyers could order with 100% confidence from QPD, he has a good track record for a reason.<br /><br />And, in my case, he made it right after a little prodding.<br /><br />Thanks QPD and thanks for reading folks!<br /><br /><br /><br />
