				I see one of SR&#039;s biggest seller is Weed....whats the reason behind it? I feel like that its easily available (at least to me). Is it just too expensive in your city or town? Or is it hard to find?

				Weed is easy to get and cheap enough where I am, but it&#039;s total garbage. Can&#039;t choose what strain, just hand over £50 and get what you&#039;re given. <br /><br />The stuff on SR is generally of much better quality, and the sheer amount of choice is very alluring.

				My wife smokes weed, I don&#039;t (allergic to it believe it or not).&nbsp; For her it&#039;s mainly selection for her. The local dealers we know sell quality stuff, but sometimes they are out when she is looking for it, so we just started shopping here now. Some of the prices are better too on SR (esp. for weight) but for the most part, under an ounce is about the same price or a little lower than what we get locally. As long as we order when she gets starts low, it benefits us to just order from SR.

				because the dealers in my town suck. the price per gram increased ridiculously over the past few years and the quality remained the same. not to mention that there are still assholes selling sprayed weed. meanwhile you have to pay like 12€/g for average quality, 14€ or more for strains like amnesia haze etc. which is unacceptable to me. i remember that 6 years ago, 10€ or more was a total rip off. 7-9€ was standard. i really miss those days...

				Because I am lazy and sometimes just have to much money I think. And I dont want the people that sell drugs in my house and I def. do not go to their so called home (again). If you know what I mean.<br /><br />The few friends that grow them self are glad I manage to get the same strain they grow to compare and such. But the main reason is still I dont want to deal with dealers in real life nor do I want to be one.

				Short story. I use SR on the subject at hand because I moved from a location in Texas to a undisclosed location on the east coast. I deal with hoods. The prices on the streets are alright as far as regs go, but still nothing like Texas. As far as dank goes the only way your gettin a good deal and hooked up str8 is if you know the man, and finding the right man in an inner city is very difficult, not to mention the treacherous narrow streets that police are steady rollin up on the corner. It just is so much worth is to say screw it, mail me some weed , sorta long but i&#039;m sure you could see why I do this.

				I can occasionally find it where I live, but it&#039;s actually way more inconvenient for me to pick it up in person around here than it is to buy BTC and wait a few days for it to ship to my place.&nbsp; The older you get, the harder it is to score from people in bars/clubs/etc. (at least that&#039;s been my experience).<br /><br />As it turns out, SR offers cheaper prices and exotic strains that I&#039;m not likely to find anywhere else.&nbsp; Plus I truly believe in what this site is doing, so I feel good that I&#039;m playing a small role in supporting it.

				Here, there&#039;s lots of competition among sellers, a review system that keeps sellers honest, and sterling products going around too. If I bought local I wouldn&#039;t get to pick the strain, buy something wild like hashish, BHO or high-strength sativa, or even be guaranteed that the weed is of a very good quality as premium weed goes.<br /><br />In our market, on another note, quarters cost around $100. For stuff that might be sold as high-mids on SR. Yet, we&#039;re actually blessed. In small towns and such, anything better than rather dirty commercial is often rare.<br /><br />TL;DR - not everyone has a dispensary card. Not everyone lives in Amsterdam. Gasp! Some people might even live in small town North Dakota.

				I personally have never bought weed online but have always wanted to. There&#039;s plenty to go around in this area but just not my cup of tea. I really claim it to be dirty. It just does not have the enjoyable essence to it. It often feels like cheap poorly managed garbage but I&#039;m too afraid to buy it online

				i used todo it over another platform which was less protected (some may remember the dgc), i bought lots of weed in my area, even on holland visits (its not that far of me) but this system here beats anything i have ever encountered, and iam just a member for merely two weeks now. (5 transactions) <br /><br />1. review system<br />- you dont even get this in coffeeshops, yes there are good strains to get their, but to find them out is pretty hard ... often the batches are limited (i guess when this platform/specific vendors becomes more popular then it could get worse here, too)<br />- its pretty hard to fake over longer terms as the review system forwards somewhat into the forums, ontop of that the 500$ vendor buyin draws away scammers alot i guess, furthermore nobody of the resellers would be stupid enough to buy large amounts from a new vendor :D (guess even most personal users would try out with smaller amounts first)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; lazyness factor<br />- i dunno about you, but standing 2hours in some weird big city ghetto with the car waiting to look at some average sprayed weed is worse then having to reload the marketpages two or three times<br />- i visited ten vendor sites of shops today ... this would not be possible in my area todo with local dealers<br /><br />3. quality<br />- the offers you can decide inbetween here is fascinating, and iam just ordering domestic at the moment, with roughly 10 street dealers i know i dont have this variety from to choose off (and told let us talk about that you need a microscope in your pocket nowadays to check it)<br />- the quality ranges from awesomexx to good allday weed, you often can read about the highness in the threads of the users before you even smoked/ordered <br />- lots of vendors allow to order smaller amounts for testing and then bigger amounts so you can stock up abit on it or take it for reselling (i guess even from a reseller perspective this platform must be awesome)<br /><br />4. security<br />- most vendors i encountered here want to keep it save for both sides (encrypted transmission of address and most likely fast destroying of those to erase evidence of trades, i mean nothing worse for a vendor that could happen that beside the drugs they find hundreds of old customer addresses which then could be used in court against him)<br />- aslong as you keep on domestic ordering in your area i dont see a reason customs should have a look at your package/mail<br />- through varierty of vendors you dont have the same sources of sending addresses ... if they really wanna stop this platform they have to look into every sorting facility which seems impossible<br />- i can finally keep my driving license while testing weed! (i allways had todo localtests and often drive back with the car stoned which kept me in danger of loosing the driving license)<br /><br />5. though not for me ... reselling<br />- you could buy weed which is most likely just as good/even better as the shitty weed the local dealers sell for 10€/g in my area for roughly 1,4€/g from mexico and resell it easly on local dealers <br />- you could buy weed which outscales all the local shit for roughly 5-9€/g online and resell it in my area for probably 12-18€/g without problems
