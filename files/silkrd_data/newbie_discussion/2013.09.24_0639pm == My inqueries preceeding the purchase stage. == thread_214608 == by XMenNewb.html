				Hello, I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m looking to buy as soon as I feel safe and secure about proceeding. I am playing it safe as I don&#039;t want to make any mistakes. Which is why I am here with a few questions.<br /><br />1) Is my SR account considered a wallet to store my bitcoins?<br /><br />2) Is the address I find in my account where it says &quot;Click here to make a deposit&quot; the same as the &quot;receiving address&quot; that I will need to provide when making a bitcoin purchase?<br /><br />3) Do bitcoin exchangers create a wallet (or some account) to hold your bitcoins after purchase? What would you recommend when it comes to maintaining your personal bitcoins?<br /><br />3) How exactly do I use the escrow system?&nbsp; I only see the options &quot;withdraw bitcoins&quot; and &quot;send bitcoins to another member.&quot; How can I make sure my funds are in escrow before the funds transfer to a vendor?<br /><br />4) Lastly. As of this moment I am only interested in purchases. What are the potential benefits to learning PGP?<br /><br />I&#039;ve had read the FAQs and spent a decent amount of hours on the forums. I just want to extinguish all the doubt and inquiry that I have before I proceed in these transactions. Safety is something I don&#039;t want to take lightly.<br /><br />Thank you in advanced,<br /><br />-Newb

				1) Yes it is<br /><br />2) The address you need to send them to is found on http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account<br /><br />3) Most do, you can have dollars, bitcoins or other currencies there and trade or transfer when you want<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you inted to keep lots of coins, you should probably download and install your own wallet with the bitcoin client rather than trust any online service<br /><br />3.5) You just make the purchase and the funds go into escrow automatically<br /><br />4) Most vendors require all communication be encrypted. Learning to use PGP takes a short while but it&#039;s a big plus for security.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Without it you&#039;re posting your name and address in cleartext and there is a possibility that someone unwanted might read it.
