				I started using the road to deliver quality for me and my friends. In my area everything is of low quality and overpriced, and sometimes bunk. So i got on here to be able to give me and my close friends the Goods. I realized i was sitting on something pretty damn amazing. I began to make bigger orders and sell to my friends friends. I started noticing extra cash which was very nice. I have never wanted to get too big. i just like delivering quality items to the people i know at a fair price. However looking through all the items lately i have noticed how much everything has gone up. I mean i am the one taking alot of time out of my day researching vendors, looking up ways to get btc and taking all the risk, but lately with these prices the profit doesn&#039;t quite seem to cancel out the risk.

				probably stating the obvious... but just need a couple of posts to hit 50!&nbsp; so heres my opinion.... prices go up and down depending on the btc value, which has not been stable lately. it went all the way up to 100€ per Btc, and then down to about 56€ per Btc, so alot of money was made/lost... it now seems to be staying at the 70€ mark, so prices may go down again.<br />Also you can try contacting vendors and negotiate for bulk purchases and they might be willing to setup custom orders... if you want to make profit from reselling it&#039;s gonna have to be about purchasing in large quantities to get a good a deal, or being able to flow with the Btc value and buying cheap and then using them when they are high.

				You gotta go bulk. The time and effort for vendors to package and ship is definitely costly to them. Find a vendor you like and see what they will do for you. Good luck!

				Around my way, the prices are inflated compared to where I grew up.&nbsp; Just the fact of moving from an urban area to BFE.&nbsp; &nbsp;Best advice would be to spend ALL your money buying the most of your single best selling product and repeat until you can buy in bulk for your next best seller and continue that way until your satisfied.&nbsp; May seem like less sales but more profit per sale...your going to have to start analyzing it like a business if you want to make it a business.

				Buy from overseas by the kilogram (a kilogram is 1000 grams, which is 1000 milligrams).<br /><br />Buy by the kilogram, if not by 100kilograms at a time. Sometimes, a kilogram is called a &quot;key.&quot;<br /><br />100 kg of a drug is a LOT cheaper than buying it 200 mg at a time.<br /><br />Buying bulk like this, then reselling domestically or even IRL at music festivals and conventions and such can make nursing a habit a LOT more affordable.<br /><br />SR sorely needs reliable domestic resellers to sell single dose or small amounts, and it is expected that you mark it up a lot.<br /><br />For example, it&#039;s not only acceptable but expected to sell MDMA for $20 a capsule, with 125 mg a capsule.<br /><br />Of course, if you care enough, you can put 125 mg of MDMA, 200 mg of meth, 300 mg of methylone, for that extra WHAM, if you are selling IRL.<br /><br />Kiddos at festivals do not care what&#039;s in it, they just want to make sure it works. That kind of dosage will give them a weekend they couldn&#039;t forget if they wanted to.<br /><br />Buyers on SR tend to be a lot more demanding, wanting a single compound as pure as it can obtained.<br /><br />Selling IRL is more risky, sure, but more lucerative and fun. They don&#039;t really ask what&#039;s in it.<br /><br />Most of them will trust you. It&#039;s good money, and fun.

				I think a cap with that much in it would create a very forgettable weekend, you would be so fucked you wouldnt know which way was up.<br /><br />Why would you want to sell such a strong cap to people you will never see again, people at music festivals you sell standard drug at standard prices and sell the strong stuff to an audience that have a chance of being repeat customers<br />But thats just me

I love chemistry, and I love providing new experiences to those that have not had them, yet.<br /><br />I have too much pride to feel comfortable offering mediocre caps to people.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m being silly.<br /><br />Most friends and people I associate with are ridiculously ADHD, and I seriously doubt they would even feel anything less than 100mg of meth.<br /><br />Though I suppose 125mg of MDMA should be pretty intense, the stimulating part will be nonexistant for an ADHD person. The meth makes up for that, and the methylone helps fill it out even more.<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were to seriously consider this, I&#039;d probably adjust the dosages to be less lethal. :P

Get a fake ID, build a giant zeppelin that makes the Hindenburg look ghetto and halfassed, and use your giant airship to act as a waypoint for space travel.<br /><br />Decent airships (dirigibles) are capable of extended flights in upper atmosphere for a virtually unlimited period.<br /><br />The most expensive part of space flight is breaking free of the Earth&#039;s gravitational pull. Getting off the ground and into orbit is the most expensive part.<br /><br />Instead of ridiculous things like space fountains or space elevators, why not stick with a tried-and-true technology... lighter-than-air aircraft!<br /><br />Just build a giant dirigible, and use that as a refueling and rest stop, and have a lower dirigible so that airliners and jumbo jets can tow spacecraft to the lower dirigible space station, then after fueling up there, being thoroughly tested and vetted, then makes the leg from middle atmosphere to upper atmosphere, refuels against at the larger, higher dirigible spacestation, then from there, it&#039;s rather trivial (relatively speaking) to climb into geosynchronous orbit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why no one else has thought of this.<br /><br />We can finally have our flying city, our fortress in the sky. Also, steampunk and anime conventions in a hotel in the Earth&#039;s upper atmosphere, bordering on low Earth orbit.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t get much more awesome than that, wouldn&#039;t you agree?

				I don&#039;t think the prices here are that bad at all especially considering the quality you are paying for that more than likely they don&#039;t have locally so you&#039;ll always have the&nbsp; best shit in town.&nbsp; I make a killing flipping stuff off SR.&nbsp; You can cop a 50grams of methylone on here for under 500 sell it for 80 gram and you making 4000 by only investing under 500.&nbsp; Or sell it as weight 625 a half oz and you making over two grand you can&#039;t go wrong.&nbsp; A good hustler can sell anything especially with SR at your fingertips you have the best connect around.

				Others have said it...<br /><br /><br />Quantity, product and demand.<br /><br />I&#039;m just starting off, with only 2 deals finalized.... but I have 8 more &quot;processing&quot;<br /><br />buy weed (domestically in Canada) by the pound, and look for good growers... You should be able to double your money easily selling by the ounce.&nbsp; If you can get killer product domestically at great prices do it.&nbsp; Generally domestic shipments like this have a 99% success rate, and 100% reship or refund options are out there on domestic orders.<br /><br />buy hash by the KG... From reliable oversea vendors with a track record of success.&nbsp; If you can buy good hash for what amounts to 3 to 4 dollars a gram, You can triple that money easily.&nbsp; Or again sell to a few individuals that do all the grunt work. In that scenario you can double your money and your dealers can nearly double there&#039;s too, so they work harder for you. :)<br /><br />Wise Product selection... I agree M1 seems to fit that bill, since you can buy a gram of pure crystal for as little as 15 bucks.... 1 gram = 6 good doses, that could retail for 20 without much argument.&nbsp; But again I would sell prefer to just double or almost triple my profit here and allow dealers that work for me to also have room for significant profit.. Happy happy.<br /><br />Nbome 25i - also holds room for vast profits.&nbsp; You can purchase a sheet of 900 strong hits of 1000 mcg each for about 35 cents a hit.... You can resale all 900 hits for triple the money to the right guy with the right connections instantly for a profit of 1200 bucks.. Just need to know the right guy.<br /><br />I personally would never work street level...&nbsp; It&#039;s always a trip to the slammer in the end.&nbsp; Buy big, have other people do the hard work, allow everyone to make money.<br /><br />At leasts that&#039;s my thoughts on it. lol<br /><br />P.s. I&#039;m new to SR..&nbsp; But I was heavily involved with Importing and manufacturing steroids for wholesale.. So I know what I&#039;m talking about... (except profits in that line of work were about 8 to 10 times... lol I regret quiting. lol)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Don&#039;t you think that there is a certain premium added because of the risk?<br />as more attention gets paid to &quot;the road&quot; doesn&#039;t it become more risky to exist here?<br />Meaning less transactions = bigger amounts per transaction = somewhat lower risk?<br />I&#039;m asking not making the statement.
