				i have brought from halfbaked a couple of times (speed) it has been acceptable product. i would say 5 out of 10<br />but my last order was for 9grams and it was completely different stuff. got alot of complaints from it and rating of about 4 out of 10.<br />besides the quality, the postage and packaging has been flawless.

				I took a chance and ordered from Halfbaked again. My previous order did eventually arrive after 2+ weeks. His rating has been going back up since resolving whatever issues he was having before so I thought it was a pretty good bet. Unfortunately it&#039;s been 5 business days since I order an oz via express post and still no arrival. Extremely disappointed. He will not be getting another 5/5 from me this time.&nbsp;

				Hi fellow SR&#039;iance ;D<br />Ohh man, im a total newbie here and my first order has been place with HalfBaked on Tuesday last week which was 26&#039;th of March. In his description he says next day dispatch. Still havent received it. But ok, let me be unlucky because of the Easter shiat.. <br /><br />Interesting though - he has not been online for the past 3 days and suddenly - all of his listings have gone just today.. while SR says he hasnt been online? I am either following the standard newbie trade and thinking too much or he has done the runner.. <br />In my order description i have &quot;shipped&quot; as &quot;processing&quot; still till today.. Though the &quot;cancel&quot; button has become available just today as well.. <br /><br />Anyone can pat me on a shoulder here? Is this (sometimes) normal for Vendors? =(( Should I cancel or wait till the end of Easter break the piece of shit? hahaha<br /><br />Thank you before hand &lt;3

				Vendor listings disappear when all the product is sold ...<br /><br />Half baked was one of the few OZ weed vendors recently and has probably been inundated with orders!<br /><br />Buyers should be patient and understand that vendors cannot just dump 50 orders in the same postbox ... Sometimes it takes a few days to catch up on a backlog<br /><br />And yes even vendors like to enjoy the easter break !
