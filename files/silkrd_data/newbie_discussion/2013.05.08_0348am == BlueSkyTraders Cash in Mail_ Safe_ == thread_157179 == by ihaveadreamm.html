				Hey guys,<br /><br />So I&#039;m considering using BlueSkyTraders, but I can&#039;t access a bank of America.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m considering their cash in mail option, however...<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t you have to provide a return address for this option? Also, they say you need to mail the money 12 hours after they contact you. Does this imply that they require tracking?<br /><br />One more thing. Where should I have the bitcoins transferred to from them? Directly into my SR, or should I have them send it to a bitcoin wallet?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Cash in the mail seems like a fine option for small amounts but I would be sketched out sending 3+ figures. Your tolerance for risk may vary.<br /><br />Why can&#039;t you access a BofA?

				It will be a pretty small amount. If it gets lost, I&#039;ll be at no real loss.<br /><br />There are no BofAs close enough. there are ATMs, although I&#039;m not sure if BlueSkyTraders allows deposits via ATM.

				I just gave BST a try.&nbsp; Hard to believe but we don&#039;t have a single BofA in our city so had to do the cash in mail (CIM) option.&nbsp; You just email them and let them know how much you want to buy along with the wallet address you want it sent to, and they will email you back with confirmation and mailing instructions.&nbsp; They lock the price/transfer rate in at the time of the email, so you have 12 hours to send the cash, which is checked via time stamp on the envelope.&nbsp; I sent the cash along with the email address I used to place the order to the address they gave me.&nbsp; I used USPS with tracking/delivery confirmation and made up a return address.&nbsp; I sent it Wed and it should be delivered this afternoon.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post an update on how this works out later today.<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t personally used BST, but I know people who do, and they have a good reputation, for whatever it&#039;s worth.

				Just a quick update.&nbsp; Delivery via USPS is taking a day longer than originally promised, but is showing out for delivery as I type this.&nbsp; 3 days to go several hundred mile via priority mail.&nbsp; Really makes me wish I had a BofA near me, it would make things a lot easier.&nbsp;

				Just a quick update.&nbsp; Received a short email today that my BTC&#039;s were on the way.&nbsp; Checked my wallet and my bitcoins had been verified and deposited.&nbsp; After reading all the good comments on the forum I didn&#039;t expect any problems, and the whole thing went smooth.&nbsp; I plan on using them again.

				I tend to not like cash in the mail period, its a pretty precious substance :P Its one of the reasons I tend to shy away from things like BST. I&#039;ve gotten so used to using BitInstant though that I haven&#039;t really looked around anymore to see if anything has changed or how reputable they are. Glad to see that it worked out... definitely brings it in as another option.

				I&#039;ve had success with them with orders in excess of $1,200. Highly recommended.

				I have used BlueSkyTraders several times now and they are completely professional.&nbsp; <br />I would trust sending them cash...just have tracking to be sure it arrives safely.&nbsp; <br />You will have your coin as promised per their instructions.<br />Coin can be sent to your SR account.<br />There is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin or having a Silk Road account.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)
