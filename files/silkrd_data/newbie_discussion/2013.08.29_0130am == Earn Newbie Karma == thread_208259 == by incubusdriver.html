				OK Newbies, so you want to enter the Big Wide World of the Silk Road Forums? $10 says you don&#039;t want to enter with +0/-250, right?<br /><br />So here&#039;s the deal. Stop spamming and start earning - in this thread, you may post freely. I will check from time to time to see what&#039;s happening... if you post something witty/insightful/helpful, you get +1. If you post something trollish/spammy/dumb, you get -1.<br /><br />*Note* Other full members may join the reward/punishment patrol freely. I just thought it would be nice to have a place on the newbie forum that was interesting to read for once, and that served the purpose of helping newbies make a great start :-)<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Your Incubus

				I&#039;m going to quote some quotes I found quite interesting from a show called Quite Interesting.<br /><br />&quot;The founder of match.com, Gary Kremen, lost his girlfriend to a man she met on match.com&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just like humans, British cows moo in regional accents.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The shortest war ever fought was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after 38 minutes.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The French mathematician Descartes had a theory that monkeys and apes were able to talk – but kept quiet in case they were asked to do any work.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ants can survive in a microwave: they are small enough to dodge the rays.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The first man to survive going over Niagra Falls in a barrel later died from slipping on an orange peel.<br /><br />&quot;One of the most searched terms on bing.com is &quot;google&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The words written on Twitter every day would fill a 10-million-page book.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;One of the common early uses of Heroin, which was marketed as non-addictive, was to help treat people who were addicted to morphine, even though Heroin ultimately proved to be more addictive.&nbsp; When morphine was first isolated from opium in 1805, one of its early uses was a “non-addictive” drug to treat people who were addicted to the less addictive opium.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />(on an unrelated note, does anyone know any tricks to speeding up browsing on these forums? page load times are relatively slow, maybe it&#039;s Tor, I&#039;m kind of new to this)

				Stephen Fry fan? Cool quotes - particularly the Match.Com one.<br /><br />Re. page load times, Tor is slower in general than you regular clearnet browsing, as data is being pinged all over the muthafuckin globe. Depends how slow yours is going though I guess, as to whether it&#039;s abnormal.

				I like this thread.<br /><br />In regards to the load times. Depending on your mobile (I use android), I downloaded the mobile Tor app (orbot), and for whatever reason, I find browsing SR and the forums to be much faster. Couldn&#039;t tell you why, just my personal experience. <br />

				Ok this is for Frank wanting to know first experiences on here.<br /><br /><br />Ok first thing first about 3 months ago I started hearing about Tor mostly seemed to be about nonces on it so as I&#039;m not a nonce I wasn&#039;t interested in it.<br /><br />But then I heard about other services on it mostly interested in drugs but did think about buying a stun gun as they are pretty cheap - but decided it was not worth the hassle of getting caught with it , only wanted it for burglars but I bought a&nbsp; baseball bat instead I can legally bash someones brains in with that but if I stunned them I&#039;d prob go away for a stretch. (But I&#039;m waffling on) blame the stimulant&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />Ok so I found this Silk Road&nbsp; and made an account but could never get in to see any wares kept saying wrong password so in the end I gave up and went off to the other site I had heard off BMR learnt pgp there and buying bitcoins and started buying some stuff there - lot of the stuff there is from Netherlands and I was not ready to go through customs especially in such a flagged country.<br />So anyway I think the dos attack had stopped and read something on reddit that the owner had stopped it tbh I did not know it was under attack thought it was my browser , anyhow had lost account info and decided to make a new one and this time I was in.<br />I could not believe how much bigger it was than BMR and loads of UK vendors , so someone had told me to start small I was like a kid in a sweet shop , I think my first purchase was 2 oxys probably 10mg I think never seen one before , so as the vendor had free postage if you bought more than one I bought two did not want to buy anymore as he might think I was trying to take him.<br />Anyway things started arriving the next day I could not believe it and how fast it was to get here as I used to buy stuff from Western Union from a bloke in Panama.But in the end the heat was on him and he dissapeared but that fella never ripped me off once it used to be a nightmare phoning Western Union and telling them I was giving him money because I owed it to him and he was a dear friend ...bitcoin is a piece off piss to that lot and the rip off fees.<br />Anyway that is my tale I have hardly been back to BMR made no more purchases there as this place is choc a block anyway my account says I have been here for 6 weeks and I have done at least $1200 here ...theres only one purchase i regret 10 oxys from listonishere for 3 bitcoins even the bloke who has just made me wait 2 weeks for an order sent some good gear that I have abused today hence my rambling on.<br />One thing I always try to do is be fair never let a vendor wait I even released straight away as he wasn&#039;t a scammer as I started to think he was .<br />I think I have released escrow on the same day to all the vendors there might have been one who waited a day , anyway no one asks me to FE so my stats must be ok.<br /><br />Anyway sorry for my load of bollocks and rambling , hope it makes a bit of sense&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Peace.

				So we&#039;re here for your amusement now you pompous bastards? I&#039;m not an SR newbie, but just got to 50 the hard way, giving people advice they don&#039;t want to hear. Already at +1 -3, oh well. I think negative karma is better than no karma. At least that means your comments have enough substance for someone to fucking take notice. Anyone with overwhelmingly positive karma probably either doesn&#039;t have much to say or the conviction to say what they do.

				Here&#039;s my experience so far with SR: Had to attempt to unlock my pin twice even though I&#039;m 99% sure I had the correct one, written down and everything. Whatever, maybe I made the same mistake twice somehow when I created it. First time I tried to unlock my pin it got interrupted due to maintenance with the feedback system. Second time was tonight: success. In my six days of waiting I spent a decent amount of time on the forums and learning PGP. I guess I didn&#039;t spend enough time on the forums though because after just now placing my first order, I realize the vendor is probably going to cancel on me first thing in the morning. Reliable vendors don&#039;t seem to want to sell to newbs. All this and the hassle it took for me to even get BTC in the first place...well, I guess I&#039;ve had to learn that SR, while being as close as I&#039;ve ever come to the holy grail, is like any other good thing: it takes patience and sacrifice. All this is a learning experience...but damn do I just want some H already. <br />-For your noob entertainment

				My experience...Well, I first read about Tor in my everyday newspaper extra - reportage magazine. At first, it seemed much more dangerous that it is really. I haven&#039;t registered on SR at once. Also, the article didn&#039;t mention the SR itself. Then I just reminded myself of this article I read when I needed a certain drug that is hard to find. When got here at first I was just astonished and nearly convinced that it has no weak sides. But stupid people are everywhere as I learned later. I am here for 4 months and had 7 really smooth transactions. I just realized I have completely neglected the forums. The more integrated the society is, the better for this lovely site. Apart from a bunch of less wise people who also got here, it is a wonderful idea in a freedom matter. I love it and I am very happy to be here. I want to serve this community with my own wisdom, it is the people who build this place. I can&#039;t stand the system, I am guerrillashaman and hello everyone ;D <br />PEACE :)
