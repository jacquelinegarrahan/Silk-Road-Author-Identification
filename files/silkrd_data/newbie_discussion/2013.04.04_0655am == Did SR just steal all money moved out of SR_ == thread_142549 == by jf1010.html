				See the post in the Customer support section for details.<br /><br />Take money out - it just disappears??&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t keep extra money here, support doesn&#039;t seem to work.&nbsp; BMR looking better every day.<br /><br />Maybe I need to make some website about that - every article written about SR - add enough that the right kind of people find BMR instead.

				Yet notice is only posted online AFTER you take your money out.<br /><br />Support gets a msg.<br /><br />Either everyone must read every msg on this board before doing anything on SR,<br /><br />OR RISK SR just CLAIMING EVERY ACCOUNT?<br /><br />You can&#039;t prove this isn&#039;t what happened.&nbsp; Is this really what is expected, to read everything?<br /><br />You didn&#039;t respond to why Support page has a notice but not the transaction.<br /><br />Lazy or Theft?<br /><br /><br />And my dealings with support have been bad - they have never responded.&nbsp; So what should I believe?

				My friends dont panic i had problem cpl of weeks ago i withdrew a large amount and after a few hours the site went down. OMG then i really started to panic it took nearly 24hrs for my coins to arrive in my wallet, after id been running around like a headless chicken i felt a bit silly. So last night i withdraw a cpl of coins after two hours nothing, so i go to bed wake up this morning and hey the coins are in my wallet. What i&#039;m trying to say is this is a complex thing we are doing and dealing with and to expect sometimes for things to go slow now and then, and id like to point out its not just SR that have these problems but many of the big firms dealing with BTC also have this now and then. So relax and your coins will appear my friend<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0319a1315a

				Well I dunno about 100% on vendors or sellers.<br /><br />Never had any trouble moving money in or out of SR.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes a while. 100% so far.
