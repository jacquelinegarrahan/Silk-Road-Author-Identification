				I ordered 3 products from the same seller, two of them arrived but one has not,<br />&nbsp;even though they were marked in transit at the same time. I have no knowledge as to how the postal services operate, is this normal that one delivery somehow separated?<br />&nbsp;It could be that the seller intentionally decided to send one later to avoid suspicion. <br /><br />It&#039;s 100mg of DMT, also there&#039;s 14gr of weed coming from a different vendor.<br /><br />What if authorities seize any of the of the packages? Would they immediately get the other one to inspect?<br />If such unfortunate event occurs would I get my house searched? DMT being a class A substance and the amount of weed I suppose is enough to convince them of an intent to sell, they might not just let it go as it would be 1gr of weed. <br /><br />What am I risking with? Can I go to jail? What are the potential consequences?<br /><br />Geez, I hope the mobile onion browser is up to par in terms with privacy/anonymity. I have said some incriminating stuff. <br /><br />Well, so far I have no reason to think it will go this way but I just want to know what would happen in the worst case scenario. If everything goes well I&#039;ll slow down a bit that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Any feedback much appreciated!<br />

				Don&#039;t stress over 100mg of DMT, if they in the unlikely case find it, they&#039;re just going to throw it out.<br /><br />your fine bro, just make sure the weed gets there a - okay.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the laws in your area but a half oz is not that much.<br /><br />No they cannot flag multiple batch packages coming to your address unless all your orders at the same time were international, then it would be possible, and that includes an investigation.

				The DMT didn&#039;t even arrive the next day after the other two came which like I said were dispatched at the same time.<br />And weed from the other seller usually gets delivered if not the next day then the day after.<br />It doesn&#039;t necessary mean that shit has hit the fan but it is a little worrying.

				I wouldn&#039;t read too much into it until a few days have passed. <br /><br />Its more than likely postal, just cos all were sent together doesn&#039;t mean they travel in a batch all the way through to your door.<br /><br />Too early to panic, fer sure.
