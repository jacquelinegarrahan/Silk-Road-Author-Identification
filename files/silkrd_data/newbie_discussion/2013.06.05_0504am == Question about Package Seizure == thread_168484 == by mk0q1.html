				I recently had my package seized by customs. Heres my OP about it : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168041.0<br /><br />I was wondering if they require a federal warrant in order to open my package to begin with, or if they could have just opened it up on the spot. The package arrived in the US on the 23rd and the letter that came with the package states that it was opened on the 27th. Would that have been enough time to get a warrant or did they just go for it? I&#039;m still trying to figure all this out.<br />Thanks

				Clean house and get clean (if you have not, And are not) If questioned about it just simply say that you have not ordered anything. If it was not a large amount then this might just be considered a &quot;Love Letter&quot; saying hey dont do this again. with not enough to persue charges against you. There are a ton of posts related to this on S/Reddit for SR and also on this forum detailing Very informative advice on this subject. Do your research and stay clean imo. Best of luck to you.<br />Jamin

				The address it was headed to is probably burned.&nbsp; I would set up shop elsewhere.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t take it for granted that they&#039;re not watching either.&nbsp; le is fuckin sneaky.
