				You can&#039;t trip two or three days in a row on the same substance because your body develops a tolerance which lasts for weeks. I&#039;m interested to know if certain psychedelics have their own separate tolerances. If this were the case, you might be able to take LSD one day, then mushrooms the next, without having weaker effects. If you had 7 distinct substances each with their own tolerances, you could effectively trip for a week straight. However, I doubt this is the case, as there must be SOME overlap.<br /><br />So does anybody know if a tolerance for one psychedelic means tolerance for all psychedelics, or if each substance is distinct and does not interfere with trips using different substances? I&#039;m not sure we know enough about our brains to answer definitively, but I&#039;d like to hear if you guys have had any experiences that might shed light on the topic.

				Different substances have different tolerances and there is not a cross tolerance for all hallucinogens.&nbsp; I have tripped two days in a row.&nbsp; I have tripped two days apart.&nbsp; I have also snorted 40mg 2c-e without getting any visuals right after tripping on 60mg for two days in a row.

				Mushrooms, LSD, and mescaline are cross-tolerant.<br /><br />You can certainly trip several days in a row, you have have to double the dosage each day. E.g., 200ug of LSD one day, 400 the next day, 800 the next, and so on.

On another occasion, the same patients received psilocybin in doses increasing to 150 mcg/kg over the course of 6–7 days (Experiment I) or 210 mcg/kg over the course of 13 days (Experiment II).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The development of cross tolerance to psilocybin in patients directly tolerant to LSD was measured by challenging the patients, after they had received LSD chronically, with 150 mcg/kg (Experiment I) or 210 mcg/kg (Experiment II) of psilocybin. Cross tolerance to LSD was evaluated by challenging the patients, after they had received psilocybin chronically, with 1.5 meg/kg of LSD.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A high degree of direct tolerance to LSD developed in both experiments, as manifested by statistically significant reductions in six of the seven parameters of response. Patients directly tolerant to LSD were also cross tolerant to psilocybin on five (Experiment I) or four (Experiment II) parameters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Definite direct tolerance also developed after chronic administration of psilocybin in both experiments, but statistically significant reductions occurred in fewer parameters of response (four in Experiment I and three in Experiment II) than was the case with LSD. Patients chronically treated with psilocybin were also cross tolerant to LSD on four (Experiment I) or three (Experiment II) measurements. The degree of direct tolerance to psilocybin was less than the degree of direct tolerance to LSD.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The development of cross tolerance between LSD and psilocybin reinforces the idea that these two drugs cause psychic disturbances by acting on some common mechanism, or on mechanisms acting through a common final pathway.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />[quotforesworne999]If so, is there a place where I can see what drugs are cross-tolerant with each other (ex: DMT, Salvia, NBOMe)?[/quote]<br />I haven&#039;t been able to find one.

				Forgive me for not looking this up but I&#039;m sure someone can answer, all of these psychedelics also drain your serotonin reserves, yes? Or is this a misconception?

				psychedelics do not drain serotonin. Other drugs do, but psychedelics is structurally similar to serotonin<br /><br />Many drugs, like methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin will drain your pineal gland of serotonin (this is an actual forced release of serotonin). Psilocybin does not do this and instead temporarily replaces the receptors with it&#039;s own serotonin like chemical, psilocybin, so that you&#039;re not actually draining your own brain of serotonin, because after a mushroom trip, your serotonin is still there<br /><br />the pineal gland is also known as the third eye<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland<br /><br />the replacement of serotonin with psilocybin during a trip affects the 5-HT receptors. This is been researched many times, but never fully explained on how psilocybin actually does this, so it remains a bit of a mystery. This is very different from many other drugs like meth, coke and pills which simply force release of serotonin, and this is why so many other chemicals have this long term side effects and hangovers, while mushrooms do not. True psychedelics, DMT, LSD and psilocybin are structurally related to chemicals that are already in your own brain. This is why psychedelics do very little physical harm over a long period of time and is also why you&#039;ll find older people doing shrooms as well as younger people<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin<br /><br /><br />Psilocybin is a tryptamine compound with a chemical structure containing an indole ring linked to an ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin is a member of the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans.[51] Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.[52] Biosynthetically, the biochemical transformation from tryptophan to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions: decarboxylation, methylation at the N9 position, 4-hydroxylation, and O-phosphorylation. Isotopic labeling experiments suggest that tryptophan decarboxylation is the initial biosynthetic step and that O-phosphorylation is the final step.[53][54] The precise sequence of the intermediate enzymatic steps is not known with certainty, and the biosynthetic pathway may differ between species.[55]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152222.msg1055165#msg1055165">Quote from: microcosm on April 26, 2013, 04:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Forgive me for not looking this up but I&#039;m sure someone can answer, all of these psychedelics also drain your serotonin reserves, yes?

				I recently bought my first few hits of acid - 150ug blotter. The first hit was great and took me back to my youth.

				In my personal experience, taking mushrooms two days in a row severely reduces the intensity of the second trip, and what is worse, it is more likely to result in a an uncomfortable or even bad trip.<br /><br />Personally, I find that I can take one day LSD and the next day mushrooms without little decrease in effects. But I haven&#039;t tried them 3 days in a row (yet).<br /><br />I would recommend to take it easy, since one also needs to integrate what psychedelics teach us!

I mean you can definitely get tolerance for dissociatives. MXE develops notoriously quick. I was (irresponsibly) doing MXE two to three times a week. Then I stopped for about a week and did 800 mg of Ketamine. Did almost nothing. And yeah, just doing the MXE and some RCs, dissociatives develop tolerance QUICK. Now, the cross-tolerance with dissociatives and more classical hallucinogens and entactogens, I don&#039;t know much about. I just don&#039;t have the kind of experience to say anything about it. As dissociatives are (unusual) depressants, I&#039;d be kind of interested in how using K would affect the use of oxycontin.

				OP here. This is pretty old, but I wanted to mention that I took 2.2mg 25i-NBOMe and 0.5g of mushrooms on Saturday (after having also indulged on Wednesday). I had an awesome trip, much better than weds. Open eye fractals, strong CEVs, and things got really animated and rainbow-colored. Also had some great short moments of spacing out and contemplating existence, disconnecting with reality etc. Violently threw my guts up an hour or so in, but after the nausea passed, everything was great (God I hate that metal taste :-\). Loved the experience, though. I plan on experimenting with more psychedelics to see if I can get different insight and also eliminate the nausea. Thanks again everyone.
