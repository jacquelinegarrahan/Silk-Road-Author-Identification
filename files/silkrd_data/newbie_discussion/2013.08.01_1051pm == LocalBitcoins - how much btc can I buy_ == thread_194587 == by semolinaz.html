				What&#039;s the deal, after logging in it tells me I can only buy 0.5 btc as I am a newb. How long does it take before I can buy more ? No proper info on this as far as I can see anywhere. Unless the seller is allowed to bend the rules, I dont know. Also haven&#039;t been able to open a new trade request all day as the site says there&#039;s some kind of server update or something. <br /><br />Can anyone shed any light?

				I think your confusing .5 for some other number, maybe 5??? I&#039;ve used localbitcoins probably 5-10 times and I&#039;ve never bought .5 or less.

				Might want to look again. I made my first purchase there last week and it was over .5 BTC. I was thinking it was 5 BTC that was the limit.

				Ahh, my bad, I was just looking at one particular seller who set his limits to max 0.5btc for any newbs like me.

				Now that sounds right. Just find a vendor who will work with you and use them. A WARNING though. Localbitcoins.com comes highly recommended on this site. That does not mean that there are no spammers there.<br /><br />I would only work with someone that has been there for a bit and has some feedback. The guy I bought from had 30+ transactions and 100% feedback. The sale went of with no trouble.<br /><br />I was able to use western union and the sale went off without a hitch.
