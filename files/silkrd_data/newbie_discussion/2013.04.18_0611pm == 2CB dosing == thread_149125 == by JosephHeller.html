				Just bought 250mg of 2CB, however I don&#039;t have scales accurate enough to measure out 20-25mg doses. So if I were to dissolve 250mg in say 250ml of water, would it then work out that 1ml of the solution would contain 1mg of 2CB? And is this a good way of measuring doses?

				what kinda dose you tryina take?? lol not condoning this or whatever but If it was me I would just chop it up as fine and mixed as possibly then split as perfectly in half eyeballed as possible and then split those two piles in half and then split each roughly same sized pile into 3 as equal piles as possible, then you can take 1 pile as good dose and 2 or 3 piles as super duper strongg, lol but I do not know your experience and regular dosages of psychadelics thats just mee&nbsp; :o

				oh yeah i forgot i would probably take like a mg worth, or the tiniest amount you could seperate from the pile and still be able to see like a dots worth and use as tester for allergy or just incase it didnt get mixed with an nbome somewhere or some 2c-b-fly! lols

				I wanna take about a 20mg dose. But I think I will try doing it by water volume. Anyone got any ideas on how long I can store the 2CB will last in water, as I wont use it all at once.

				If you don&#039;t have 0.001g scales....... buy some! If you&#039;re working with RC&#039;s on an anywhere-near regular basis, it&#039;s only a matter of time before a mis-eyeballed dose fucks you up. Or you get some bromo-dragonfly or something by mistake and snort a massive line.<br /><br />Like Not_a_sheep says, start with 1mg or so just to check that you&#039;ve got the right compound. Work your way up dose-wise.<br /><br />Until you get some scales, the liquid measurement method is fine. 250mg in 250ml water or alcohol should work fine (1ml = 1mg).<br /><br />Tripz

				If you keep your liquid in the fridge, it&#039;s gonna last longer. If you keep it in the freezer, it&#039;s gonna last longer still. Probably years.<br /><br />Or you could make your 250mg 2cb : 250ml solution, measure a portion of it out (say, 50ml). Then turn the remaining unused 200ml back to powder by evaporating the water off. Powder will keep a long, long time if dry and stored well. I&#039;ve had RC&#039;s in the past that were still fine after 3 years.<br /><br />Or buy some scales :)

				Yeah solution is much more accurate, oh yeah and if you like 2c phen&#039;s, with me i get sick off of just about everyone except 2c-p which i&#039;ve found to be able to take MASSIVE amounts of with no ill effects whatsover and just a crazy almost meth frenzied feeling straight acid ( and i think possibly mescaline even though i&#039;ve never tried) trip hardcore mixed together. 2c-p is high up in my book as one of the best psychedelics for me.

				I love 2cp as well. Long duration, low dose. 10mg does me fine. Very visual and no body load. <br /><br />Shulgin is a genius.
