				I still can&#039;t wrap my head around that. How can i calmly place my name and/or signature on a package of drugs?<br /><br />It only makes the case against me stronger. And this isn&#039;t the US, where post is sacred :\

				I have no issue with it for small little bits than can be classed as personal. <br /><br />If/when I get something in greater bulk that&#039;s when the doubts will creep in.

				Someone could easily just send you a package with your name on it<br /><br />In Canada, what the police do, is put malachite green in the package. It is inconspicuous, until you wash your hands. It does nto come off with water. The police will then come in, and evidence of not calling the cops combined with the malachite green on your fingers = enough evidence to prosecute. A package with your name on it would be enough for suspicion, but it leaves a lot of room for doubt.

				Receiving something in the post is never a crime, no matter what it is! It could be a gun or uranium, but if they can&#039;t prove you ordered it. it isn&#039;t a crime and not your fault. They&#039;d just confiscate at worst!

				Sign for it, finalize with your vendor, then let it sit in your closet for a week. If someone comes busting down your door, they&#039;ll see the unopened package and all your lawyer has to say is that you had no idea what was in it, and just didn&#039;t get around to dropping it off for return to sender.

				The best part of SR is the vendor puts your name on the package of drugs!<br /><br />And yeah, it&#039;s not risk free, but probably better than getting into a car with some sketchball who is likely packing heat...

				Hahaha, I love how worried people are about buying from here. Compared to buying on the street this is all good. God I remember copping dope in the Cabrini Green projects in the winter of 1997. Going up into the tower projects all boarded up with Muhammed Ali Foundation painted on all of the plywood covering the windows. <br /><br />Have you ever had any of your other packages inspected? I have been notified when car parts break through their packaging and they deliver everything in tubs. I have had thousands of packages come in over the last ten years. A couple have had contraband, but for the most part they have been legit.<br /><br />Really, with as many problems as the post office has with budgets there is barely enough time to deliver the mail let alone worry about the contents.<br /><br />Unless you are an asshole and have really pissed some people off in your local law enforcement. But if you are an ass then you probably will deserve what you have coming. <br /><br />Don&#039;t broadcast that you have contraband coming in the mail and you should be fine.

				Had a nice meeting with police 2 weeks ago because my vendor was wired, I could read the transcript of one of our discussion, felt strange. Anyway it was just for testimony but now I&#039;m more fearing talking to any vendor with a phone that my name being writ on a drug package. All is about the quantity: I can&#039;t imagine a bulk order here

				I&#039;ve no issue with having my name on the package.. though, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d go to a post office and sign to collect it.&nbsp; I would probably sign at the door as you&#039;d still be able to plead ignorance of the package&#039;s contents pretty easily.<br /><br />It&#039;s a hell of a lot less risky than doing deals around town.&nbsp; My cannabis dealers usually disappear or stop dealing after a couple of months and switching makes me extremely uneasy.&nbsp; My last guy had nice product but always bullshit me and said he had product when he didn&#039;t and had to go pick it up from a friend.&nbsp; He said he was getting out of the game and wanted to pass me off to his cousin for business.&nbsp; I was hesitant (as he was being super sketch) but also wanted some goods.&nbsp; I called to meet the new guy over some drinks and turns out the guy was wired.&nbsp; I was careful and avoided any direct conversation and managed to walk away laughing.<br /><br />..now, I am here.&nbsp; Fuck that mess.

				Buying drugs IRL scares me at least 10x more than ordering on SR with proper security (BTC hygiene, PGP).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also never underestimate the value of your time.&nbsp; It is immense.&nbsp; SR is much more efficient than copping IRL.<br /><br />Just stay smart about it.

				Also, a fun fact:<br />In my country signing for some package is enough to prove in court that you knew what that package contains.<br /><br />Looks like i&#039;ll have to limit myself to tiny packages and alot of shipping costs.

				Your decision, there are other ways of getting a letter without your name on it. If you live somewhere where a small amount of drugs could land you in serious trouble maybe it just not worth it. There is plenty of information on the forums we can&#039;t think for you.
