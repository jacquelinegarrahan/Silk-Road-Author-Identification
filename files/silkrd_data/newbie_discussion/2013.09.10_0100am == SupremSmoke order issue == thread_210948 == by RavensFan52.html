				So I ordered from SupremeSmoke for the first time on Friday around 2:45 est hoping that he would make an exception to his 12:am cutoff for same day delivery. The order did not ship Friday which is understandable because his profile clearly states the cutoff is 12:00 am. It is now Monday 9:00 PM and the order is still marked as processing which is concerning because I ordered express and was relying on the order arriving by Tuesday at the latest. I have the option to cancel the order in about 7 hours and I&#039;m not sure what i should do. I have sent him several messages over the past few days and he has not responded to any of them or even read them which really has me confused and somewhat upset. He has great reviews and I am not really sure why this is happening, has anyone else had a similar problem with this vendor and if so what advice do you have for me. P.S if the vendor reads this do not take this as me hating or as me recommending other users to avoid this vendor, I am just looking for advice on what I should do...
