				www.btcquick.com seems to be working pretty good and u can pay with credit card. Do all the sites listed above require a bank account as I don&#039;t have one and don&#039;t plan on it either. What sites can I get btc from without bank account other than LocalBitcoins.com? Whish Bitinstant would hurry and reopen!

				None should require a bank account unless you are looking to turn BTC to cash (cash out). Localbitcoin uses the most methods to convert cash to BTC. Not heard of a bank account being required for use on localbitcoins.

				Once you get everything set up Virwox is super easy and super fast. I can usually go from cash in my bank account to bitcoins in my silkroad wallet within 2 hours. The only drawback I have found is they have limits on how much you can deposit in a 24 hour period.

				What is the Cheapest way to get bitcoins out of all these? How much does it cost to wire money to japan with mtgox, I was reading it could cost alot? I was thinking about buying off someone from localbitcoins, it seems like 90% sell their bitcoins for more than the current price to make money. Also what is the cheapest way to send money to someone on localbitcoin? I see alot of sellers use okpay and it says it costs .5% to transfer so say you want to send someone $100, so it would cost only $5 to send it?<br /><br />Sorry about a million questions. Thanks

I was a bit nervous considering that I was risking my $400 (plus her commission of 12% or $48). Especially in light of the many recent reports of bitcoin scams, including some scams from previously trusted vendors.<br /><br />Happily, the bitcoins were in my SR account within a day, at the prevailing exchange rate.

				Attention SILK ROAD:<br /><br />If you are going to allow BTC vendors and/or venders selling bitcoins to utilize your Silk Road start an escrow for those transactions ASAP. I am sure you have the data, how many BTC listings are ordered then canceled? Out of those canceled, how many souls reported the vendor? <br /><br />Why can local bit coins do it and not SR? DPR make this a priority! <br /><br />You see that angry mom on CBS 2 last night?&nbsp; Her son was smart enough to stay high on house arrest but then goes on camera to talk about it, cool story bro! I sure that was GGATZ!<br /><br />Anyway, if SILK ROAD lets the robberies continue, the victims will become the next thieves because they have no other choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all get high and watch this happen. SILK ROAD lets stop this now. It will never end and only get worse. <br /><br />THIS NEEDS TO STOP BEFORE IT STOPS SILK ROAD! <br /><br />WE NEED A EASY RELIABLE WAY TO GET BTC AND THE BAD GUYS ARE MAKING IT HARDER GET BTC OUTSIDE OF SILK ROAD.<br /><br />YOU ARE FACILITATING THIS BY ALLOWING BTC SALES WITHOUT AN ESCROW SYSTEM! <br /><br />

				An escrow system for BTC would require the seller of BTC to deposit the bitcoins into SR&#039;s BTC receive addy, then tumble it on the way out to the buyer. <br /><br />Seems easy enough. Except anonymity issues that might crop up.&nbsp; Plus I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a hidden pitfall somewhere in there that I can&#039;t think of right now.&nbsp; Maybe Astor would know of hand what it is and the problem of implementing something like this on SR.

				I am here to recommend LOCAL bitcoin all the way!&nbsp; &nbsp;I was nervous about using a new service, due to Bitinstant being down, but even if and when they come back up, I will be using local.&nbsp; I requested my bitcoin from someone with excellent feedback, I met my guy at Starbucks, and the&nbsp; transaction was done on his phone, and I could see my bitcoin instantly appear.&nbsp; It was just so easy and completely painless.&nbsp; I switched to him from another who was charging a bit more, but I believe I also got a decent deal from this person.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to meet, you can also do it online, but I felt safer meeting and not worrying about&nbsp; moneypaks or similar type ways to fund.&nbsp; <br /><br />

They have all your info, should you just limit yourself to small quantities or not even go that route.<br /><br />I have another question, whats the best way to to get say 300+ give or take, bitcoins in one day.. hypothetically. Not that I will need to but say you did.. Would most of you still go through localbitcoin?

				I like CampBX. If you use dwolla you have to wait 30 days to send bitcoins out, but if you do a money order deposit you can send bitcoins as soon as you buy them. What I like about them is their btc are always cheaper than the competition. At this very moment the mtgox weighted avg is $104.46, SR has them valued at $101.97, and you can get them for $96.78 instantly on CampBX. If you can stand the 3 or 4 days to wait for your money order to get there then CampBX is a good value.

				I&#039;ve used bitcoin-brokers.org a few times and received my BTC within a few hours of making a cash deposit at the bank. My go to source for now.<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to try CampBx. Their exchange rate for buying BTC is usually lower than the price here on SR but I don&#039;t want to hassle with mailing in a money order and waiting 4-5 days to buy the BTC. However, if you have the time, it looks like one of the best exchanges at the moment.

				Yes, it leaves a paper trail. But buying bitcoins is not illegal. The risk of using paypal is with the seller since you could potential chargeback the transaction. <br /><br />So you might want to tumble those coins before sending to SR

				BitBargain is a UK market for buying and selling bitcoins - https://www.bitbargain.co.uk<br /><br />Prices vary according to which sellers are online; typically they run from approx the same as Mt.Gox prices to well above them. Most sellers accept payment by bank transfer, but other methods specified include Pingit, OkPay, Ukash, and Natwest PYC. I&#039;ve used them a couple of times without a problem.

				What&#039;s this talk about Thamiddleman? <br /><br />And no we&#039;re not related. Who came up with that nonsense? And no I don&#039;t work for emo-whatever bitcoin scamming outfit. The forum auto-filters out the URL of these scammers who post hundreds of spam threads every couple of days. <br /><br />What idiot would think I work for a scamming bitcoin site when I list them as scammers all the while providing the community with a list of places to acquire BTC? <br /><br />What&#039;s wrong with some of you people? Thamiddleman in particular. I do you a solid of adding you to the list and you turn around and accuse me of working for some BS bitcoin scamming site that relentlessly spams the forum? WTF?<br /><br />Say bye-bye from the list. <br /><br />Matter of fact, you should probably be added to the SCAMMER section of the list. How&#039;s that for making baseless assumptions?

C O M (given that it is listed as a scam site and the vendor Cimicon doesn&#039;t deal with Bitcoins yet provided this community with a valuable resource any), one must conclude:<br /><br />ThaMiddleMan is setting up a scam and run operation.&nbsp; He&#039;s trying to generate as many orders for BTC as possible in the shortest amount of time by spamming the forum to attract victims. What will happen next is that he&#039;ll cash out all the MoneyPaKs he receives and perhaps put up an excuse on his page for the inevitable delay in processing orders. Then he&#039;ll fold up shop taking listings down and last seen will report days and weeks. <br /><br />But since all it takes to become a vendor is a $500 bond, he&#039;ll simply start up again under a new account and repeat the scam using a small portion of the money he stole from unsuspecting victims. <br /><br />All would be advised to steer clear of this person and instead use the established businesses and vendors on the list. <br /><br />You have been warned.

				Well, I would disagree with localbitcoins. I got fukt by a dude with 30+positive feedbacks. Initially responded quick, said all the right things and based on the feedback and reviews I felt pretty comfortable. Well, once I sent the MP # he disappeared and won&#039;t even return my emails. So I tried to call the number on the add and holy shit it put my phone number on some dialer. I have my number blocked so I don&#039;t know how the hell that happened.&nbsp; I was getting calls from all over the globe every 10 minutes. Had to change my number. <br /><br />Anyway, this guy is a scammer,<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/28719/buy-bitcoins-with-cash-detroit-mi-usa<br /><br />Now how do I get back at him?

				I&#039;ve always found someone on SR to get coins from.&nbsp; Fortunately I haven&#039;t been ripped off.&nbsp; &nbsp;That has been a matter of luck because when I was new I could have fairly easily gotten scammed.&nbsp; My last SR source for bitcoins has been MoneyPakJack and he has been great.&nbsp; When I found he was no longer working I was alarmed and explored many alternatives but hadn&#039;t found any which I was happy with.&nbsp; LocalBitcoins is undoubtedly good, but I found it difficult to learn how to use it.&nbsp; I could have figured it out eventually, and I might yet have to learn it, but it is a lot more difficult than buying a MoneyPak card and sending the number to someone on SR.&nbsp; Now that MoneyPakJack is back in business, even if only occasionally, I won&#039;t have to learn to use LocalBitcoins.&nbsp; I recommend MoneyPakJack above all other sources for bitcoins.&nbsp; Only 5% commission and the bitcoins are in your SR wallet in 10 minutes.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp;

				MoneyPak Trader appears to be solid. Saw his post here and decided to just use the website. I&#039;ve got the MoneyPak ready to go, but I decided to wait a day or two since the BTC rate has been dropping in my favor. However I read his reviews very thoroughly because I wound up doing some graphic design work for him through BTChat, wanted to learn more about the site. He promised $25 worth BTC to the design he liked best. I had it just a few hours after posting my design, I think he even threw in a little extra. Apparently he has some rivalry with someone on BTChat who posts lots of negative feedback, but it seems to be from the same person. I plan to use his service as soon as I like the BTC rate. Seems way easier than going through all the BitInstant shit anyway, good riddins to that I guess.

				There are a lot of exchanges out there (I wouldn&#039;t use them though).<br /><br />I would take a look into localbitcoins. Very easy to use and anonymous. You can either do cash meet up or buy online by depositing cash into the Bitcoin Vendor&#039;s account. Like Cimicon-Rep said, they have escrow as well. That helps protects buyer and seller.

				SO <br /><br />I was in escrow for near 4 days with CryptoKeeper.. with no response and he went awol. I had sent previous messages and communication was non existent pertaining to inquiries of orders worth thousands of dollars.. The order was canceled. <br /><br />I only placed an order with CK as I was waiting for 7 days total for BTCpal. BTCpal communicated throughout their multi day absences a couple times.. but after a week I couldn&#039;t wait any longer. The order was canceled. <br /><br />BLONDIEBITCOINBANKER<br />Decided to try them out and risk it with a new vendor. THIS VENDOR IS THE BEST! As long as I&#039;m here and without one of BTCKING&#039;S banks nearby..

				Also with coinbase you can loan up to 10 BTC from them and pay them back later :) just verify your account and you can buy up to 10 bitcoins instantly, Just dont have enough money in your bank to cover it and the payment will bounce. then your coinbase account goes negative and you just pay them back as u can
