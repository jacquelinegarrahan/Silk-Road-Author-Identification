				You would think the first post would do the trick. Spamming your bitcoin scam just screams obvious. They might get more suckers if they did it just one time.

				You&#039;d be surprised, if only .01% of everyone who viewed the spam fell for the con, the spammer would have already made profit.&nbsp; The spammer just sits back and collects, it&#039;s all profit, from an automated program.<br /><br />But yeah, in an effort to fight the spammer, we should institute a policy of 500 posts before you can post on the main site!&nbsp; That&#039;ll show the spammer.

				dngdwn - thanks for the big up!&nbsp; Yeah man, get some on the cheap while they last.&nbsp; Got a few orders today, and only doing the sale till friday!&nbsp; But may keep prices a bit lower in general after the sale has finished (maybe have my normal prices 25% less than i had them before)&nbsp; Looking to give everyone a chance to give them a try, especially now BTC are so expensive, thought I would put a sale on, so people could make an order with some BTC change they may have!
