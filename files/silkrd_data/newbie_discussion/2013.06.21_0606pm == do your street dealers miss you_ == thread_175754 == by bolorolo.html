				anyone have their dealers wonder where they went? what do you tell them?<br /><br />i pay over $400 for bud where i live, and thats actually pretty cheap for here<br /><br />seeing as on the road i can get similar strains for between 260-360, im hoping this will replace my current situation<br /><br />pretty sure my guy will be missing me

				To be honest, it would be really cool to have IRL connects for drugs that are as pure and uncut as the ones you can get on SR. I would love to be able to drive over the house of a respectable human being and pick up a professionally packaged 10-strip or a bag of powdered GHB. Or MDMA ecstasy pressies. But the truth is that SR is really the only reliable place you can find these things. And I&#039;m not about to go looking around town trying to get connects. I actually kind of like it that most people don&#039;t know I even do drugs. That&#039;s how you know you&#039;re a responsible user, in my opinion. When your use doesn&#039;t affect relationships, work, living situation, etc. If I had a dealer, that&#039;s someone that could say that I use drugs. And I don&#039;t want that going around to be honest. I&#039;m not an addict, or a &quot;druggie&quot; or any of those stereotypical people. I&#039;m a person living out his life, and sometimes I choose to enjoy a chemical that alters my brain chemistry for one reason or another. I don&#039;t see anything wrong with that. Anyways, if I did have a street dealer, he probably would miss me...but I haven&#039;t had a street dealer in years haha. I&#039;ve usually been the dealer.

				They seem to be pretty hit and miss sometimes, especially when you don&#039;t buy from them often. At least SR has reviews from other users!<br /><br />I would be happy to pay a small premium for someone else to order stuff off here and onsell it to me. Less hassle with BTC, postage, deciding what to buy, etc. Call me lazy meh.<br /><br />Still keen to get into this community though.

				Not at all, considering I never actually bought street. I&#039;ve bought weed one time as a birthday present for a friend, but I&#039;ve never really got involved in the physical drug market. I&#039;m a fan of the accountability SR provides with review threads.

They have a video showing you how to do everything and how it works! I personally like that link because it means there is a lab and people that are sending their shit out to get professionally tested! That&#039;s wussup.

				my street dealers still come to me from time to time asking why I ain&#039;t visiting them that often no more. Much like that scene from workaholics if you lot did not catch it. <br /><br />I still buy from them once in awhile for old times sake, or rather being paranoid that they find out I order from SR and nick my post.&nbsp; :-\

				My old dealers and I were colleagues.&nbsp; I found out about SR and they kept wondering why I had the upper hand (my goal was never to get too big, but when I&#039;ve started offering better products at half the price, they start to wonder).&nbsp; I never said a word about SR, but they were clever enough to figure it out on their own.<br /><br />The kicker is, they&#039;re too afraid to actually start buying even though I&#039;ve offered to teach them PGP after the fact.&nbsp; So they place orders through me XD<br /><br />
