				I consider vendor communication to be one the most important parts of the vendor/buyer relationship. Its right up there with shipping time and quality of product. Many vendors seem to blow off messages from buyers. Say they are &quot;too busy&quot; and behind on messages. UNACCEPTABLE. If your too busy to communicate then you are too busy. Step back, slow down, even shut down. I don&#039;t care if you think the questions buyers have are stupid, repetitive, or whatever. Just answer them. I&#039;m no longer doing business with vendors who refuse to answer my question in a reasonable amount of time. If I walk into a store and ask a vendor a question and get blown off, do I still buy there? No, nobody would. The same should apply here.

				yeah, there&#039;s a huge gap between customer service in the real world and here. I&#039;ve had some experiences with some good sellers, but some...wow...<br /><br />For instance, I had a run in with a vendor who posted their listing with &quot;Free Shipping&quot; in the product description and then refused to honor it because they posted something on the message board (which as a newbie, I hadn&#039;t gotten into yet). <br /><br />In real life they would have been an honest, good businessperson and would have honored their listing and changed it.<br /><br />The response I got was basically too bad for me and he&#039;ll change it next week...NEXT WEEK?!?!<br /><br />So yeah, I agree with you.
