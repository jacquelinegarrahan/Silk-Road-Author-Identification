				So, this is my first go at SR and I wanna make sure I&#039;ve done everything correctly. <br /><br />I used bitinstant to transfer my cash into bitcoin through the moneygram phone at my local cvs. The cash showed up in my mtgox account almost instantly, so I bought some bitcoins. Now, here&#039;s the part that I&#039;m unsure about... I got my wallet address for my sr account, and entered that in the &quot;withdraw&quot; form in mtgox. It&#039;s been a few hours, and my funds still haven&#039;t gotten into my silk road wallet and I&#039;m starting to worry. Do I just need to wait, or did I just throw away my money? Thanks in advance for any help, and let&#039;s hope that my membership here on sr is a long and fruitful one!

				Hi brother, nice to meet a fellow SR newbie. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a few (small) transfers into my account in the last week or so, and all these times it has taken a few hours. Sometimes SR just moves slowly and these things can take a little longer. I shouldn&#039;t sweat it, if it&#039;s well into 24 hours or something then you might want to start poking around for answers, but for now just take it easy and do some window shopping to take your mind off it! ;)<br /><br />tda

				Hey, it does take a while to confirm the transaction at which point it will show up in your account.&nbsp; Using the following website, you can see your transaction and whether it is confirmed or not:<br /><br />clearnet warning - https://blockchain.info<br /><br />Paste the bitcoin address you sent the coins to in the Search box and click Search.&nbsp; You should see your transaction and its status there if MtGox initiated the transfer.&nbsp; I would suggest you use an anonymizing tumbler to put some obsfucation between your MtGox account and your SR account though.&nbsp; Here is a link, check this out, you may wish to use it next time:<br /><br />clearnet warning - https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-anonymously<br /><br />blahblah1234

				Hey astroman, the transactions you see withdrawing BTC from the deposit address is the built in BTC tumbler on SR.&nbsp; It is nothing to be worried about.&nbsp; The BTC should show up after the first transaction (initial deposit) gets 6 confirmations.&nbsp; Some users have been reporting errors where their accounts arent being credited.&nbsp; If you have 6 confirmations, and no BTC in your account you can shoot support a message and they will take care of it for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thumbprint, the people at CVS probably wont know to much about BTC.&nbsp; There is much more info and better info here on the forums.

				&#039; I got my wallet address for my sr account, and entered that in the &quot;withdraw&quot; form in mtgox&#039; I think is where you broke the link in the equation. It clearly states on mtg that if they found out it was going into a tor account they would close the account. I think I messed up too. But not in the manor you have. I did not tumblr. I went bitinstant, store, then it went mtg, from there I stored into my offline wallet. from tehre I put them in blockchain and then to sr. <br /><br />I did not know that blockchain was something to not access through liberte or torbrowser until now. So yeah, I think I will have to make my next deposit different as far as blockchain part goes. That being said. I am open to anyone telling me I fucked up terribly, or even minor.

				I&#039;ve held off moving any coins in or out of my SR account since last week when all the dramas started unfolding with accounting errors, withdrawal and deposit issues etc. <br /><br />I decided to try and move some in today and guess what... I&#039;m now waiting too.<br /><br />Seems like there are delays still, if you were still waiting today then you did the right thing to contact support, they will be able to push the coins through but you might wait a bit longer for a response.<br /><br />

				I really do believe your error was going mtgox to sr. Especially if you are using that browser. I guess SR as a tumblr if you do that way. Every single guide/advice I received previous to doing my first btc transaction. In not one of them does it advise on doing such a method. If mtgox got a whiff if you did that. They take your stuff. And they state they will if they find out you are depositing them through tor. <br /><br />Use several wallets. That&#039;s all I know to do. I used 3 wallets before I upped it to SR account. I had zero issues. Perhaps you deposited way more than I. And mtgox just ganked your shit. I do not know, What I do know I said.

I still haven&#039;t even decided how exactly to turn my cash into Coin. But I can&#039;t believe they would just take your money if you are sending it to a TOR browser. Delete your account? Maybe, but that&#039;s kind of a dick move in my opinion. Forget PGP and all that stuff, getting BitCoin is far and away the most difficult aspect to the process so far IMO. Just yesterday you were trying to help me get through the FIRST PART and at this point I don&#039;t even want to use BitInstant because I think it might be on the decline, or having problems at the very least. I would like to know of alternatives to BitInstant if anybody has them.

				I was worried about how I used blockchain. I no longer am. Not after seeing people post that they deposited directly from mtgox to SR. And if those people accessed mtgox from torbrowser, You need not worry why your shit has not shown up. <br /><br />I was mearly worried about the trail I may have possibly left behind. I now feel confident I have taken the proper steps. I strongly advise that anyone that is thinking about going mtgox to sr, to not do that. It is fine to use mtgox for your deposit from bitinstant. Just move it to a couple wallets after that before putting onto SR is all I recommend.

				Could you possibly explain to me the importance of having multiple wallets? Where do I even acquire them anyway (for offline purposes) -- there&#039;s so many different websites to remember, Mt.Gox, BlockChain, BitInstant, blah blah blah<br /><br />If there is a comprehensive, and correct BitCoin tutorial -- I would be very interested in reading that. If there isn&#039;t one, I think it would be an awesome thing for the Newbie forums if somebody would make one and then it could even get stickied maybe? I have heard many people say getting BitCoins is the hardest part of the whole deal. It&#039;s really kind of overwhelming, especially considering some people have had money get lost OR scammed from them or whatever.

				The offline wallet is a wallet that is software that I got from Clearnet warning*** bitcoin.org I believe it was, you can google it if you like. So I installed that wallet and when I open it(I have it installed on an encrypted file system on my main drive)You follow the instructions and make a id/name, it will get you a id to use where you can deposit coins to it. #!@!@!#Note!!@#@#@ You must sync all the blocks within the program before you deposit or you will be here asking why it is taking so long.@#!@#$!@$ Once it is synced. I go to mtgox and put in the code where I want to send those coins too. You will have a code and see a button for receive within that software. <br /><br />They refer too it as offline, (this is what I assume) because you do not access this wallet through your tor regardless if you&#039;re using torbrowser, tailz, or liberte. It is just software, Think of it as a safe in your home. You put it in there and take out what you want into SR, whichever means after you use. Me and blockchain, for me that is my walk around wallet. I deposit a couple coins in there depending on what I want to buy. Similar to your wallet in your pocket. You do not take all your money when you&#039;re going to get bread. But, you may want to get something else right? So, once it is synced up and you go to receive, for me was about 30 seconds for them to send it into it. From there I put them into blockchain, and then on there I deposited onto SR.
