				I&#039;m seeing a lot of dutch sellers increasing the list of countries they won&#039;t ship to due to intercepts. That combined with the fact that the Netherlands is already quite well known for producing drugs, makes me wonder if you&#039;re risking an intercept more by ordering from that country? If it matters at all, I live in the UK.

				I live in a European country (not UK) and I have had many packages delivered from the Netherlands. I believe the problematic destinations from the Netherlands are the US, Australia and Scandinavia. Why don&#039;t you start with a small order, just to see how things go?

				NL to US is a huge red flag. Always has been. With that being said NL is a known flagged country. Alot of MDMA comes out of there, But tons of packages (drugs) still get delivered regardless. Its a crap shoot but like the above person said, start with a small order. My hopes is that youll be fine. I have order from NL and never recieved my package, but i am also from the US and im not 100% he even sent it.

				i&#039;ve had plenty of nl&gt;uk orders come through fine. weed usually too. just ask them to stealth it in a hollowed out wheel of edam. best way. keep that method quiet, 100% success rate.
