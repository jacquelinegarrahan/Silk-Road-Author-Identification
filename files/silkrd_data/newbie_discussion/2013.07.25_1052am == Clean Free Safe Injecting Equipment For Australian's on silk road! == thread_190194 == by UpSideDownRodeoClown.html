				Long story short.&nbsp; A handfull of people are clearly cashing in on providing Free to community, safe injecting equipment.<br /><br />This is what I want to do, to help play a part in IV harm minimisation on SR.<br /><br />Buy my free listing, and in the address info box tell me what Equipment you need. No restrictions! However, keep in mind: micron filters, butterflies and tornequets, cannulas are charged for per unit(ill find out prices and have them listed).<br /><br />If you want the extra chargeable item&#039;s, you will pay the price that the NSP does!<br /><br />Once we know your requirements, ill skip on down to the exchange/community health etc. Pick up your free safe clean injecting equipment, take it to auspost inside a auspost satchel, get the quote for postage.<br /><br />Then i will create a custom listing for $0 and just have the quoted postage to sort out(exact same as quoted), fill in address field with your preferred delivery location, and ill get it to you as quick as it can!<br /><br />ALL YOU&#039;LL PAY FOR IS POSTAGE AND ANY EXTRA UTENSILS YOU CHOOSE which are not provided free of charge.<br /><br />It makes me sick to see people charging $1/p syringe in boxes of 100, and then making you pay for postage?!?<br /><br />Studies have been conducted In Australia as to cost vs return of programs such as NSPs.&nbsp; For every 1 clean needle they in effect save $75(maybe it was $25? Either way its really significant) tax payers dollars which would be chewed up treating complications which arrived from either using your own dirty, blunt puss filled syringes.. or even worse someone else&#039;s.<br /><br />INFECTIONS<br />AMPUTATIONS<br />NERVE DAMAGE<br />BLOOD POISIONING <br />BLOOD DISEASE(hiv, aids, hep ance etc )<br />NASTY SCARING <br />LOSS OF SELF RESPECT<br /><br />All can and do occur if clean injecting equipment is not readily available.<br />And I do understand how uncomfortable, nerve racking, embarrassing feelings, paranoia, or even risk of judgement can and will make it hard to access these services in their communities.&nbsp; I WAS ONE OF THOSE.<br />Now I want to take on all that for anyone who can&#039;t/won&#039;t/doesn&#039;t want to, so in my way I can give back to the community, well the SR community.<br /><br />I might open a donation fund to help ease postage costs for you all. I&#039;d love to be able to pay for your post, but I am mearly a man.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Let me know what you all think, and hit me up on SR if you need my help in providing you with what you deserve!

				Perhaps a moderator could post this to the product offers and drug safety sections of the forums as I don&#039;t have a high enough post count to do so.&nbsp; I hope they will, as it is a serious and essential harm minimization strategy in regards to IV/IM drug users.&nbsp; Vendors should not be allowed to be profiting as they are.

				Shame on the filthy scum buckets who are charging people a premium.<br />As I have said, I will make no money. I will do all the leg/car work, ill put up with the judgemental volunteer/nurse/chemist, ill be the one getting seen in public accessing these services(which is why some choose not to).<br /><br />Maybe I am just delusional, I&#039;m not sure how many people have inflated the egos of scumbags and actually purchased them.<br />I think its a pretty solid concept though.

				Damn you this was one thing i was going to offer from my vendor account im opening was just going to charge for shipping had it all worked out with NUAA and RUSH too <br />I thought the same thing $85 for something you can get for free or max $4 from a vending machine but the weirdest thing is they all have BD syringes (which i hate) whereas I have terumo
