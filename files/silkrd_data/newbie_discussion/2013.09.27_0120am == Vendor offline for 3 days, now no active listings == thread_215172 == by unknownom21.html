				I placed an order with a vendor a few days ago, along with a message confirming some info. The messages haven&#039;t been read and the vendor&#039;s page indicates that he/she hasn&#039;t been online in nearly 4 days. Now there are no active listings... How could they de-activate their listings if they haven&#039;t been online? Do listings disappear automatically if a vendor hasn&#039;t been on? Should I go ahead and cancel my order since it is still &quot;processing&quot;?

				Vendors are automatically put in vacation mode if they do not log on for 2 days. Their listings are also taken down when they are in vacation mode. I&#039;d go ahead and cancel that order, it doesnt seem like the vendor is interested in selling on SR

				Okay, great. Thanks for the responses.&nbsp; The vendor is actually back up and running, he/she sent me an email about order overload (was a pretty new vendor) and the order is now in transit.. Phewww!

				I&#039;ve had the same problem with Kqueen, kinda worried about my order. Had to FE because it was shipped internationally, guess i can only hope for the best and learn from my mistakes right? Do understand that alot of these good people are SWAMPED with orders, and some of them are either paranoid or are ACTUALLY drawing unwanted attention so they go off the grid for a little bit. I&#039;d recommend researching here on the forums about a particular vendor before you order, because i&#039;ve seen a couple of &quot;trusted&quot; vendors go rogue and become scammers now.
