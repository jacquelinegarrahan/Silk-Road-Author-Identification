				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re suffering from chronic insomnia I&#039;d strongly recommend you research cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. There is some pretty strong evidence that medications for insomnia, at best, barely provide better sleeping patterns than insomniacs undergoing no treatment, while having a varying range of shitty side-effects. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Cbt-i is a proven treatment for sustained, long-term relief of insomnia, but it&#039;s definitely not a quick fix. It takes quite a lot of effort and perseverance during your brain training. The payoff is healthy, natural, drug free sleeping patterns.

				Just a caution, I&#039;ve seen Trazodone clinically prescribed for insomnia. It&#039;s a very YMMV drug. Everyone seems to respond uniquely. Hell, I&#039;ve experienced it differently often.<br /><br />First time tried, came on suddenly, felt heavy, and eyes want to close. It&#039;s not necessarily pleasurable. I slept, but kept waking up every 90min or so (roughly a full sleep cycle) and had nightmares (actually a real side effect). I never have nightmares. I could not recall the details though. Felt unrested in the morning.<br /><br />Second time, felt heavy suddenly, heart racing, tried to sleep, heart kept racing, and it had to opposite effect for treating insomina.<br /><br />Third time, slept quickly yet woke up earlyish and a bit unrested.<br /><br />etc.

				True insomnia, if not stimulant induced, can be awful :/<br /><br />What I found works for me is 9 mg melatonin, 3 mg pills x 3 (this also has tremendous anti cancer help, and strong anti oxidant properties)<br />I also take this with .5 mg -.7 mg on a bad night of Xanax. <br /><br />I have been a daily user of &quot; G &quot; Since 1999 ...&nbsp; <br /><br />The actual GHB powder, made with NAOH, or, the stronger form, pure GBL 1.4 g per ML of solution if pure,&nbsp; has a far far stronger &quot;Rebound&quot; effect than say, 1,4 butanediol. <br /><br />butanediol, from what I have read, can possibly be more liver or kidney toxic.. but I&#039;ve never drank, and my liver and kidney values have been in the healthy ranges, and that&#039;s after perhaps 12 gallons of the above mentioned liquids fired down the hatch.<br /><br />Meth, Pentedrone, MDPV (horrific..) and many other stimulants, if taken say 6 hours before bed, will NOT allow me to sleep on the combo I mentioned..<br /><br />typically if ones binges like hell on stimulants, then the sleep just won&#039;t happen, although we all know it should lol..<br /><br />I wish you well my friend, I hope things improve. Please let me know how ya make out :) <br /><br />WizzBang<br />

				Like others have said weed is probably your best and safest bet.&nbsp; It&#039;s something you can continue to use without fear of side effects, rebounds or withdrawals.&nbsp; Xanax, Valium and the benzos and then ambien and hypnotics all work great but they&#039;re not something you&#039;ll probably want to continue doing long term.&nbsp; You&#039;ll become dependent on those drugs and then you&#039;ll have to have them.&nbsp; Try the indica based weed like OG Kush a couple hours before bed.&nbsp; That should get you pretty sleepy.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not working, smoke more.&nbsp; Weed&#039;s the one drug where I feel safe telling a stranger on the net that.&nbsp; You can never have enough weed.&nbsp; You can&#039;t overdose.&nbsp; So if you&#039;ve never tried it, get to it and get to sleep!

				cannabis! phenibut would work as a temporary solution as would a fair few benzos and opiates. basically most stuff prescribed for sleep, anxiety or pain will help you sleep but that&#039;s a rough road of dependence to go down. no idea what pills you&#039;ve tried already but stick to cannabis if possible. you can get cbd tinctures or capsules which do not contain the trippy compound that is thc. gotta say i found ghb terrible for trying to sleep and i tried pretty damn hard.

				Honestly, the best cure for insomnia is to workout, meditate (can be from 3-25 mins), and to eat right. I&#039;ve been having insomnia for about 2 years now, imagine your ankle having a deep dull pain 24/7, you&#039;re completely depressed because you can&#039;t do anything physical without pain and you develop horrible SA, and the only thing your doctor and therapist will prescribe you is 10 0.5mg Lorzapam every month, Zoloft, and this bullshit Trazadone that doesn&#039;t work. <br /><br />Honestly, the only thing that actually worked to make me fall asleep was working out and taking a shower right before bed, but my ankle is so fucked up lately that the pain just makes me uncomfortable in every position. Try running 1-3 miles every day or every other day, getting on a 3 meal plan, and then get on some kind of meds, you&#039;d be amazed how much it helps. Plus, running keeps you in shape and you&#039;ll live longer, which means the longer you&#039;ll get to do drugs :P

				I have been dealing with insomnia for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Complicated solution:<br />Wake up early (8am), exercise, shower, meditate. Biggest meal of the day is breakfast. Have a long productive day, spend at least 2 hours in direct sunlight. At the end of the day (around 6pm to 9pm) take a one hour walk or run. In the evening time: First, smoke your weed, second, have sex or fap then: eat a small healthy dinner. Lower the backlight on all your screens, install f.lux for computers. Don&#039;t listen to loud music or anything loud. Go to your bed and within one hour you should maybe drift off to sleep. (This is the perfect schedule for me to 75% chance go to sleep that night for at least 5 hours of sleep.)<br /><br />Easy solution:<br />Zolpidem (Ambiem) Use it no more than once a week. Try to completely stop using it eventually, to be only used for sleep emergencies ideally. (100% chance to go to sleep that night with at least 7 hours of sleep)<br /><br />Obviously the complicated solution is also a guide to living a healthy productive life while the easy solution will probably lower your life span by 10 or 15 years. <br /><br />If you are desperate begin with easy solution and start slowly adjusting to a complicated solution. <br /><br />Sleep is THE MOST important thing. Do not let anything, anyone, get in the way of you sleeping at least 7 hours a night. And turn off the fucking screens for a second!<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; :)

				&lt;&lt;&lt;Insomniac here. There&#039;s some good advise in this thread and I&#039;d like to add to not eat too late and try turning the A/C down a few more degrees if you live in a hot climate.<br /><br />Also, modafanil is prescribed for this. The theory is that it wears your mind out during the day and you sleep better at night. I&#039;ve been through several sleep studies and tried this. It works but kept me too wired up during the day and gave me headaches.

				Meditation worked/works wonders for me. <br /><br />If you know what&#039;s keeping you awake you can go from there. Apparently the most common cause of insomnia is racing thoughts/worrying/inability to switch off etc...Meditation will help with this.

				Same boat, and I agree with the longer posts in here. Fact is, without determining the real cause of your insomnia just throwing random hypnotics at it might even make it worse. Most benzos prescribed for temporary relieve end up giving you rebound insomnia that&#039;s worse than the baseline. You might have a messed up circadian rhythm due to a melatonin imbalance, or simply not enough physical strain on you during the day, could be a plethora of different things. Maybe you have mold in the walls in your bedroom, or sleep apnea.<br /><br />Read up on sleep hygiene (no, it got nothing to do with showering :P).<br /><br />Try to follow the guidelines found on the big reputable sites like WebMD, work out, add a little weed.<br /><br />When I was worst off my sleep deprivation really fucked with me so I started self-medicating with benzos. Worst mistake I could have made. After 4 weeks I started craving them in the evening which prompted me to taper off, by the time I had halfed the dosage my insomnia got worse than it was to begin with.&nbsp; &nbsp;
