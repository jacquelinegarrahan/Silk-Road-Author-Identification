				Doing 25mg of #3 brown H for the first time seemed very difficult for a first timer.<br /><br />At first there was just little wisps of smoke and spent 20 minutes before getting most of done.<br /><br />It did get more smokey with time but used cut coke bottle top to catch smoke and at one point using the cylinder for the foil as a large pipe. <br /><br />Even when getting a good lungful noticed a lot of smoke escaping.<br /><br />Mind you when 20 minutes was over nearly fell of my chair then rolled around on the floor moaning for a bit before feeling like wanting to be really sick. Then that went and&nbsp; was laying there kind of vibrating for 2 hours.<br /><br />Is there some art and skill to the perfect chase?<br /><br />Edit: vaguely remember reading about using a pipe. What specific type?<br /><br />And I have to say that the first E and in particular the mind blowing peak was a better experience.

				Hey.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been smoking black tar heroin for a couple years.&nbsp; When smoking H, DON&#039;T use a toilet paper tube!!&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine that doing that alone would totally screw u up.&nbsp; DO use a bic pen, pull out writing end, then pull the plastic &quot;stopper&quot; off of the other end.&nbsp; &nbsp;DON&#039;T use the bottom of a can (although I must say I&#039;ve never attempted to do so).&nbsp; DO use aluminum foil, heavy duty is the best.&nbsp; I always smoked on the flat side...But, people all have diff opinions on that.&nbsp; DO use a lighter with an adjustable flame, I found that using bic lighters SUCKS.&nbsp; The flame is WAY to high &amp; too hot...Makes all the drugs burn up, into the air..&nbsp; A small flame (half the size of a bic flame) works great when you&#039;re having issues.&nbsp; This will give you more control.&nbsp; Load small amounts until you feel like you&#039;ve got the hang of it.&nbsp; Please, don&#039;t be stupid, know your limits, and PLEASE don&#039;t ingest benzos &amp; H together- Unless you are knowledgeable about both<br />&nbsp;&amp; what the effects of them together are (death- this is how MOST OD&#039;s happen!!).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much Luv-&nbsp; FairiesWearBoots666

				Thanks. I think I was using crap foil as my hand got hot even when the flame was far away. I got more success once I turned the flame down to low setting. I started with the pen thing but it seemed like I was only catching a small amount of the smoke while lots of it went into the air.<br /><br />I&#039;m not intending on doing this again for a long time as I tend to keep my distance from things I know have a high addictive nature. Just wanted to experience it once I was sure my mind was made up it was a one time only.<br /><br />Now maybe I a once a year only. But I&#039;m in no hurry to do it again.<br /><br />Also it was tainted slightly by earlier use of stimulant of unknown branded RC. It had been a good few hours but I can&#039;t say for certain the duration of the stim. I found I couldn&#039;t relax all that much and was on high alert constantly checking my mood.<br /><br />also stopped taking prozac completely but only a few days ago. I have benzos if things get heavy. Just want it out of my system. I don&#039;t need it. And my most loved MDMA is useless until it&#039;s completely out of my system.
