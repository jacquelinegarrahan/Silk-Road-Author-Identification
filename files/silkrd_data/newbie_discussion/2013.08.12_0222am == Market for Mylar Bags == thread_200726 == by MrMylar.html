				I currently run a clearnet mylar website and was curious to know if there was a decent enough market here to &quot;set up shop&quot; so to speak.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Mr. Mylar

				This guy doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about, not everyone wants to link a credit card and address to go along with it to mylar bags.<br /><br />It&#039;s not super sketch but I always buy my MBB&#039;s here on SR, and frankly I don&#039;t believe there are enough vendors for it!

				there is no need for everything to be bought &quot;completely anonymously&quot; on SR. the bags have plenty of legitimate uses and everything you do is not getting you in trouble. there is no way to trace one bag from another, so although you may not think I know what I&#039;m talking about there is no need to not buy them for 75 cents a piece.

				I got a bomb ass deal on mine. Not .75cents per that&#039;s for damn sure.<br /><br />&amp; as a matter of fact most MBB&#039;s come with a barcode or serial # on them. <br /><br />You won&#039;t be able to tell for sure in most cases until after the purchase, not to mention if your a vendor and ever caught having something like that on a credit or debit card statement isn&#039;t cool...<br />

Say you ordered a disposable cell phone off a public clearnet site, big deal, right? Say you also ordered 2000 mylar bags, a miligram scale, a disposable cell phone, and some envelopes with your real identity on a clearnet site. Who would look better in the event of a court case?
