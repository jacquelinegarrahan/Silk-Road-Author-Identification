				Have you tried www.virwox.com ?<br /><br />They accept PayPal, Skrill, Credit Cards, Neteller and they do accept uKash as well.&nbsp; If you are going to deposit via uKash however, I would recommend depositing your uKash vouchers into a Neteller account (www.neteller.com) first, and then from Neteller, deposit into VirWox.&nbsp; The fee is lower this way, and VirWox has no deposit limit for Neteller.

				Hi rayzzz !<br /><br />Fellow french buyer here :)<br /><br />I personnally used &quot;bitcoin-central.net&quot; and i was pretty satisfied. You WILL need to make a &quot;money transfer&quot; to Paymium (the company owning bitcoint-central) bank account in order to get BTC. It usually takes me 24H to transfer money to bitcoin-central.net and convert it into Bitcoins.<br /><br />I also think it&#039;s worth mentioning that bitcoin-central.net offers double-authentication (just like in Gmail) so it looks really secure to keep your Bitcoins safe.<br /><br />As far as i know, you can&#039;t really buy Bitcoins fully anonymously in France yet. Got to rely on SR&#039;s Bitcoins tumbler :)

(and the money workaround to protect against LE)...but frankly u loose lots of money , i&#039;ve tested it.<br />I would say this method profits both Neteller &amp; Virwox (which IMAO doesnt have a lots of uses when u&#039;re french , so far only Virwox allows u to but some Lindens, then some bitcoins with it)<br />Theres a 40 euros limit with PayPal...so just leave it.<br />I am now considering having a verified account on MtGox , which seems to be the most straight-up method to buy it.But they will verify your identity prior to that...<br />Anyway , you&#039;re gonna buy some bitcoins to play online games, don&#039;t you ???? ;)
