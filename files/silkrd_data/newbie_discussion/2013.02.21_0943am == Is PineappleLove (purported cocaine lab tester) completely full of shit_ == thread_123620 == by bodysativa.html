If I had the disposable income to buy the primo coke here and give it away, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Am I going to ask for donations?... or samples?&nbsp; If I&#039;m buying Earth&#039;s most primo shit, and giving it away... do you think I&#039;m hurting for cash?&nbsp; Do you think money is an issue in my life?<br /><br />And if I&#039;m not wealthy... do you really think I&#039;d be giving away what precious coke I did buy? <br /><br />If I wanted to scam people into giving me free drugs here, how would I go about it?&nbsp; Lie, right?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chemistry:<br /><br />I&#039;m not the all knowing coke chemistry wizard... but I did take a shit-ton of chemistry way back in the day.&nbsp; I worked in a lab/manufacturer for many years... and if a lab ever told me that Cocaine HCL has a maximum possible purity level of 89% I&#039;d laugh in their fucking face and want to beat &amp; mug them right there.&nbsp; No legit chemist anywhere in the world would state such an inaccuracy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t believe me... it took me a whole 20 seconds to google cocaine hcl (CAS: 53-21-4)... look for yourselves, look at the purity levels.&nbsp; &gt;99%<br /><br />http://www.weiku.com/General-Assay-Diagnostic-Apparatus/buy-Cocaine.html<br />http://www.tocris.com/dispprod.php?ItemId=5327#.USRlXcjLejB<br /><br />So either we believe anonymous random people on the forum saying that 89% is the max purity cocaine HCL can be/achieve... or I believe chemical suppliers, labs, articles etc.&nbsp; Hmm. <br /><br />My best guess is that those originally claiming 89% is the max... don&#039;t understand the difference between quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis, and are mixing the two. <br /><br />Yes... if you convert 100% C-HCL into C-base, you will lose the weight of the HCL (~11%).&nbsp; So that means if you started out with 1 gram C-HCL, basified it then weighed it... it now weighs 0.89 grams.&nbsp; Which you can now re-acidify back to 100% C-HCL@ 1 gram. (what you were looking for was an extra 11%+ loss of weight to identify presence of impurity... thinking it wont rock-out w/ the coke)&nbsp; But this acid/base conversion is a very bad measure of purity... since other adulterants also have/may have similar acid/base properties... such as the other Caines and levamisole.&nbsp; Just like coke will &quot;rock out&quot;(precipitate), these things are in there (I suspect) because they too will rock out with the coke.&nbsp; That and numbness.<br /><br />A legit lab would use a combination of instruments such as GC/MS, NMR, HPLC... maybe a couple of them, maybe just the GC/MS since it is already two in one.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; But no way would they rely on just rocking the coke out and weighing it... misunderstanding mols and the weight loss.&nbsp; They would understand mols.&nbsp; Not to mention, this lab is supposed to specialize in testing illicit substances. <br /><br />What&#039;s being shoveled, doesn&#039;t add up.&nbsp; And for me... a link to a testing facility web site doesn&#039;t prove squat.&nbsp; I need to see some instrument readouts etc. <br /><br />TL;DR <br /><br />89% is not the max purity level of Cocaine HCL, or it&#039;s base form... and anyone claiming that a lab is telling them this, is straight out lying.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d love to say maybe someone is hustling them, but there is the matter of disposable income, donations etc..&nbsp; And you people are praising him, giving this guy free money and samples, hanging on his every word.&nbsp; smh<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.msg845794#msg845794
