				If you agree this is a scam post scam. It&#039;ll get attention of mods and SR crew. Happy spamming!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2de8ff1f55<br /><br />#PRICES ARE AS FOLLOWING:<br /><br />$5.000 = 30% (for $1.500 in BTC)<br />$10.000 = 25% (for $2.500 in BTC)<br />$15.000 = 20% (for $3.000 in BTC)<br />$20.000 = 17.5% (for $3.500 in BTC)<br />$20.000+ = 10% | *BUSINESS ACCOUNT REQUIRED*<br /><br />they can work with legit suppliers and take 60% of all accounts. Why would they do this? And the crap about the SRM-Cipher encrypted computers.<br /><br />Even the price list is flawed. They would sell a 40k account for $4000. They could easily split that up into two 20k trans and make 17.5%.<br /><br />If this is so anonymous and the loots theRE for the taking, why limit to only x spaces.<br /><br />Complete joke! Can&#039;t believe it&#039;s still active.

				Description<br /><br />UPDATE 24/08/2013 - 11 places left.<br />UPDATE 27/08/2013 - 9 places left.<br />UPDATE 28/08/2013 - 5 places left<br /><br />**********************************************<br />LOOKING TWELVE (12) LONG TERM BUSINESS-PARTNERS (in U.S./EU only). SO FIRST COME FIRST SERVE.<br /><br />We are looking for people that are able to accept bank transfers in the UNITED STATES and EUROPE in exchange for Bitcoins.<br />LIMITED TIME ONLY.<br /><br />We will provide more specific info to those that are serious contenders and are interested in long-term exchanges. However, to provide a synopsis of what is being offered...<br />Funds are deducted from multiple bank/merchant accounts, it all happens from SRM-Cipher encrypted computers and in rather small amounts. This enhances the non-flagging of source accounts (i.e. avoid sending red flags to intermediaries). Anonymous bank accounts are therefore not required.<br /><br />Though it is unnecessary to use anonymous bank accounts, they may be used as long as they do not carry low withdrawal restrictions that will restrict your ability to withdraw funds in the amounts transferred by wire.<br /><br />If accounts are held in your name, it would be suggested that you don&#039;t repeat the process too often on same account number (e.g. more than twice a month). But should be more than safe to carry for infrequent terms.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been doing these kind of bank transactions for some time (approximately 2 years 4 months); but can no longer handle all the transfers ourselves any longer. This plan allows us to engage business partners that will benefit from this sort of money-making process; while we continue to benefit in buck transactions.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you to determine how often you want to engage in the incoming wire transfers, in the denomination of choice (based on the schedule below).<br /><br />Again, to answer the all-time repeated question from previous inquirers; low-balance anonymous bank accounts are not worth the trouble due to the low-limits allowed for withdrawals, otherwise we could just order a bunch of Anon cards ourselves. It&#039;s safe to use on a regular bank account as long as you understand we cannot exceed a certain denomination of deposits (&gt;$20,000); and do not procure transactions on the same account too often in a short period of time.<br />This is why, for us, it&#039;s not possible to continue making transfers to ourselves and not catch the attention of banking authorities.<br /><br />#PRICES ARE AS FOLLOWING:<br /><br />$5.000 = 30% (for $1.500 in BTC)<br />$10.000 = 25% (for $2.500 in BTC)<br />$15.000 = 20% (for $3.000 in BTC)<br />$20.000 = 17.5% (for $3.500 in BTC)<br />$20.000+ = 10% | *BUSINESS ACCOUNT REQUIRED*<br /><br />Once you have chosen your terms, and submitted your depository information, the funds will be in your account within 48-72 hours after the process has commenced. The only information required to be submitted is<br />1. Account Surname (last name)<br />2. Account#<br />3. SWIFT Code<br />4. Routing# (please ensure it is for wire transfers)<br />5. IBAN (if applicable)<br /><br />**** We do not offer escrow for this service anymore, we have not been scammed, however we wish to ensure this remains the case. So, if you so choose to enter into this agreement, you will be required to pay the first transaction fee upfront. When we see that we can trust you, we will offer escrow as an option. Sorry, but those are the requirements. We are vets on SR, with this being our second vendor endeavor.<br /><br />Our feedback, longevity, and time on SR speaks as a public record of our endeavor to always deliver a satisfactory (if not exceptional) product w/customer service in mind. This offer is no different. We are not adept at terminating our reputation here for what would be a one-time short monetary gain. Our capabilities are unsurpassed. Our reputation is our earmark.<br /><br />Some additional time-saving FAQ...<br />#1. We do not accept paypal, ukash, paysafecards.<br /><br />#2. We do not change the price because that&#039;s all you got.<br /><br />#3. We do not send you anything for free / do not PM with Q&#039;s like: &quot;What can I get for $100?&quot;<br /><br />#4. Yes, no-limit anonymous cards can be used.<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt;WE MAKE BANK TRANSFERS IN EXCHANGE FOR BITCOINS&lt;<br /><br />#PRICES ARE AS FOLLOWING:<br /><br />LIMITED:<br /><br />$5.000 = 30% (for $1.500 in BTC)<br />$10.000 = 25% (for $2.500 in BTC)<br />$15.000 = 20% (for $3.000 in BTC)<br />$20.000 = 17.5% (for $3.500 in BTC)<br />$20.000+ = 10% | BUSINESS ACCOUNTS REQUIRED! **<br /><br /><br />For any question please feel free to contact us!
