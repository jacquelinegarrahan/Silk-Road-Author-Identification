				I have no idea what I am posting but sometimes I wake up in the middle of a heated conversation between me and my subconscious mind. It&#039;s as if though it&#039;s telling me to do something but I am arguing against it, or the other way around.<br />Not anything bad, per-se, but just silly things like what color to paint my wall. (I rescently had to re-paint my walls)<br />No, actually, this whole post is a lie, and I&#039;m not quite sure what&#039;s going on at the moment- I feel as if though I am limited in my existence specifically only to bad dreams and my entire like ongoing, thus far, and to come, has been simply a bad dream in the mind of a psychotic man sitting in a padded cell.<br /><br />I think I may be intoxicated again.<br />I&#039;m not sure.<br />I should stop licking things I find in unmarked vials.<br />I think SexyWax is pretty cool.<br /><br />There used to be this girl I used to know who was obsessed with watching the movie Inception.<br />I&#039;m not sure where to buy flowers from in the winter.

				I put the telephone chord on the wall.<br />You guys should stop taking it off the wall because it is really annoying- it gives me an intensie urge to talk and type about telephone chords.<br />What the fuck is going on because inception and deep sleep<br />much like freezing a bug in cryogenic liquid and then reanimating it later with clay
