				Hi! <br />I&#039;m pretty new on silkroad. So far everything worked out fine, but right now I&#039;m having issues with a vendor. First he announced some problems and delays, then I asked about my order after about 10 days (EU to EU). He now finally offered me a reship and I accepted it, but the letter wasn&#039;t sent out so far and my order will auto finalize in 3 days. I don&#039;t want it to auto finalize because I have perfect stats so far. <br />What is the best move now? finalize it myself, saying &quot;I wait for reship&quot; or &quot;resolve&quot; the order? What exactly happens if I use the resolve button?<br /><br />thanks for your help,<br />hr

				resolve takes the decision to sr support. resolve will allow you to extend the time for auto finalize so you can wait and see if the order arrives.

				I&#039;m in the same spot as you.<br /><br />Resolve.<br /><br />Pick the Extend option, and choose a reasonable extension time 10 day extension.... (sounds good to me)<br /><br />Then what will happen is.... Your vendor will have 5 days to accept you extension, This will show as Due in 5 days.&nbsp; I believe the Vendor can also counter with suggesting a short extension etc...<br /><br />Regardless, if the vendor doesn&#039;t accept (like my vendor hasn&#039;t accepted yet), when the due in ____ days gets to 0, it will automatically go to SR staff to determine if your request will be granted... In this case your asking for an extension so it&#039;s very likely you will receive it... Specially since in this senario, your vendor didn&#039;t even bother to accept your request for a resolution.<br /><br />Now none of this will probably matter if you didn&#039;t choose a tracked method of delivery... Cause all any vendor would have to do is simply say he shipped it, and SR staff would have no choice to believe him unless of course there was a obvious issue where he dropped off the planet for a few weeks and most clients started complaining of being ripped off. etc...<br /><br />Anyway no big deal with resolving and asking for an extension.
