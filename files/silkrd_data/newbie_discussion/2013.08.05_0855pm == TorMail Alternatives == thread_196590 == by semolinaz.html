				The answer is that you shouldn&#039;t trust any email service. So make sure nothing sensitive goes through your email account, unless it&#039;s PGP encrypted.

				Yeah PGP is a no brainer but an alternative email provider is needed now that allows you to sign up when your using tor for a start, gmail &amp; the like won&#039;t do that as far as I know + im sure there&#039;s loads of other potential flaws with these too, I dont&#039; know for sure. <br /><br />we&#039;re gonna need someone in the know to suggest some alternatives

				Whatever you use, make sure you make a new account and only log into it with TOR. Each and every time.&nbsp; One time you forget and use your regular internet connection, and they will link you to that account and you have to start over.<br />

				so, what are the alternatives to tor mail? need something semi-anonymous like tor mail... something that allows you to create an account when your connected to it through tor. Hopefully someone can suggest something soon.

				Try looking into this:&nbsp; &nbsp; https://silentcircle.com<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have not yet personally used the service but it seems like the next most anonymous email client aside from tormail when it comes to server locations and the turn over of data. Many articles on the company all over the clear net feel free to do some research as I still am myself.<br />

				So I looked into the suggestions &amp; as far as I can tell they all need some kind of payment, so not so good for anonyminity.<br /><br />This is stressing me out a bit now, thought I had it all ready to go &amp; then the tor mail thing happens yesterday.<br /><br />What is everyone else doing? Do I even need an email account ? <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;d be doing:<br /><br />Bank cash deposit on localbitcoins &gt; coins into my localbitcoins wallet &gt; transfer coins to blockchain &gt; transfer coins to SR &gt; talk to vendor on SR with PGP through SR (no need for email??) &gt; all communication with vendor is done on SR right?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been researching all the stuff I can now for months &amp; now, finaly at the last hurdle, when Im ready to dive in, this email thing is fucking me over!<br /><br />Please help, my brain hurts.

				ok, sorry.. looks like safe-mail.net is free. Am concerned though that in the terms &amp; conditions it says this:<br /><br />&#039;Disguising the origin of transmitted content is prohibited&#039;<br /><br />Does this mean if they check up &amp; find out your using tor for &#039;disguising&#039; things they can just wipe your account?<br /><br />I dont get it, why aren&#039;t there more people on here talking about this situation with setting up a new email right now? Everyones bridges are burned with TorMail now, so what the fk is everyone using??????<br /><br />thanks!

				Just a quick update in case anyone is reading this. https://www.vmail.me/en has been suggested as one to use for registering with localbitcoins, blockchain etc. but the site requires java to be enabled! <br /><br />Oh god, this is all seriously doing me in now. Is it now the case that we&#039;re going to have to wait for someone to set up a new .onion email provider before we can move on??<br /><br />what to do???

				The problem with most clearnet email services is that they either straight up block Tor IPs or ask for some kind of personal information like a phone number to &quot;verify&quot; your account. I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be long before another onion based email provider will pop up now that there is a demand for one.<br /><br />Either way, whatever email provider you use, you should ALWAYS assume that it&#039;s run by LE. Take the proper steps such as using PGP for every message and you should be fine.

				I think the only way now is to go to an internet cafe or something with my laptop and register a new email account there, that way I can run java without the possibility of my ip being detected.

				If PGP is still secure then technically it doesn&#039;t matter what email you use as long as you encrypt everything important/incriminating, In theory you could even use an fbi.gov email and be perfectly safe provided everything is PGP encrypted.<br /><br />That and of course provided you can use the email website without using any scripts or applets.

				Hide My Ass email service looks good for buyers, I&#039;m not so sure for sellers.&nbsp; You set when your e-mail account expires then it is completely wiped (1 year max.).&nbsp; You can sign up anonymously.&nbsp; I&#039;ll always encrypt though

				No clearnet email provider can be trusted. Look at what happened with Hushmail. There were two famous cases, one involving a steroid dealer and the other one involving Farmer&#039;s Market. People believed their emails were encrypted and Hushmail didn&#039;t have the ability to decrypt them. They were wrong. Don&#039;t trust any email provider that tells you the same thing.<br /><br />If you need an email account for registering on sites or getting bitcoins, use disposable addresses, and create a new one for each new thing you do so there isn&#039;t a history of your activities in one place, like there was on Tormail.<br />

				The service I mentioned is as you describe tanamon, only problem I can think is if you use localbitcoins, the max you can buy is 0.5BTC for your first 3 transactions or something like that
