				onetwothree I&#039;m glad you pointed that out because i can find bad spelling and grammer unnaturally infuriating. So i&#039;ve taken your advice onboard. Thanks<br /><br />Sardinesinacan chill out if you can<br />it was more of a joke than a masterplan<br />just trying to keep things fresh, man<br />I can tell of rhyming you aint a fan<br />so from now on I&#039;ll give it a ban.<br /><br />Your advice has also been taken onboard and i&#039;ll quit the rhyming was just trying to make some people laugh by turning scrounging into a song. Did not think i would actually piss anybody off so sorry dude<br />Rondo

				Rondo420, I don&#039;t have any bitcoin either, other than less than .01 btc which I can&#039;t seem to spend since it&#039;s anywhere from .005 to .009 btc but it was rounded up.&nbsp; If you get any donations, could you kick me a small donation of .005 btc?&nbsp; I&#039;m also california on SRM.

WaNT TO CLEAR THIS UP THAT I&#039;M NOT LOOKING FOR COIN AND I&#039;M ALSO NOT BOTHERED ABOUT FREE SAMPLES I PURELY DID THIS TO BRING A SMILE TO PPLS FACES AND IF ITS A VENDOR WHO WAS GIVING OUT FREE SAMPLES ANYWAY MAY BE MORE INCLINED TO BECAUSE I&#039;VE MADE A BIT MORE EFFORT THAN STANDARD BEGGING. SO PLEASE STOP WITH THE ANIMOSITY EVERYONE. i&#039;M HER TO TRY TO MAKEE FRIENDS NOT OFFEND PEOPLE<br />Many Thanks<br />Rondo
