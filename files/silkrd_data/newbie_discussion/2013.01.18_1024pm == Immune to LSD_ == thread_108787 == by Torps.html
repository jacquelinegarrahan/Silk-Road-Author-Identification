				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried psychedelics before and decided to buy some LSD and have a little to pass on to friends.<br />I bout various samples from vendors and got them today.<br /><br />So 2hrs ago I took my first 150ug dose two hours ago, nothing! Thought it was bunk so tried a different 150ug blotter from another very trusted vendor - again no effect. And so I had a third dose of 150ug from a different blotter batch and bang! No effects!<br />Obviously these three separate vendors aren&#039;t selling bunk and reviews attest to that, they provide legit shit but all literature reports that I should be seeing a tree growing out of my TV right now but if anything I&#039;m just sleepy :(<br /><br />So is immunity possible? I&#039;m not on any other medications bar aspirin and whatever.<br /><br />Any ideas?

				No I&#039;m pretty sure no one is immune to LSD. What was the setting you were in? Were you alone in your room just waiting for it to kick in or something?<br /><br />I have been around people in my life who were clearly tripping on LSD and just acting weird. They refused to believe(for a minute) that they were tripping until you actually would point out to them that they were acting so weird. Then they would understand that it kicked in and just let the trip take them. Maybe that is the instance in your case.<br /><br />Or maybe your LSD just has yet to kick in. Which isn&#039;t normal at all, it should kick in at the lastest, 60-90 minutes after consumption. Not really sure what else to say. Maybe your idea of it working is literally seeing a tree growing out of your TV, which doesn&#039;t happen. Chances are it probably kicked in and you don&#039;t even notice and just think everything is normal right now in your weird world of a mind. Which also makes for a cool trip.

				Awesome! Since you took 2 hits, you should be having a pretty fun trip, just relax :)<br /><br />Everything comes in waves, for example, for the first few hours of my trip I was just like you. Laughing and smiling at everything. I was completely childlike!<br /><br />And then for the rest I was very introspective and my mind was super creative. I also saw visuals for the second half of my trip.<br /><br />Look at a pattern, stare for 20 seconds and see if it moves :)<br /><br />Each trip is different though so you never know what you will get, but you can definitely expect an AMAZING time no matter what trip you get.<br /><br />Have fun.

				Well it was three hits!<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping for something unusual!! We shall see! <br />I usually do my chems alone, enjoy them better in solitude and I&#039;m in a safe place so no worries of a bad one, my mood is great :)

				Oh didn&#039;t notice you took a third hit! Well this will be an awesome trip for you, what a way to start out with psychedelics.<br /><br />That&#039;s good that you&#039;re in a safe place. I like to enjoy my LSD in solitude myself. <br /><br />I love listening to music throughout my trip, and especially during the come up. :)<br /><br />Try:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjKcmZGhUrQ<br /><br />and<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e26L6iUQA4c<br /><br />and<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhPH1QJGHwQ<br /><br />or even<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNWv5YtogyI<br /><br /><br />The first two are my absolute favorite to listen to while tripping. You took so much so I would definitely expect to see visuals soon. Just remember that you&#039;re on a drug and everything is okay. <br /><br />If you need anything, feel free to ask&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Thanks for the advice!<br />Tripping pretty hard but still more than in touch with reality. It&#039;s a good feeling but I still want to go to sleep - should I fight the urge or just give in?

				I would fight it and try to find something else to do but that&#039;s just me. <br /><br />You can go to sleep if you&#039;re really exhausted though, it&#039;s always nice waking up a few hours later still tripping, even if it is more mild.<br /><br />LSD is a drug that even at medium to higher doses you&#039;re still in touch with reality. You can be seeing bright colors and spinning patterns and maybe seeing random shadows/having hallucinations at the same time, but you are still in touch with reality and can function. You sound pretty functioning right now. It could also be fun to write down your thoughts and what you feel in a notebook and stuff to look back and see how different everything was.<br /><br />So yeah basically you can sleep if you wan&#039;t. Usually when I fall asleep it&#039;s only for an hour though :)

				I think there may actually be a fraction of a percentage of the population who are immune to LSD, they don&#039;t metabolize it properly or something like that, vaguely remember coming across it before. But I suppose it&#039;s irrelevant to the OP now, hope you enjoy yourself! :)

				I used to like to take a nip size bottle of bacardi(another high proof will work too)and drop 4-5 hits of paper in there and shake it up and let it sit for 10 min, then shake again and get the paper out with tweezers, then slowly sip on the bottle throughout the evening.&nbsp; Oh yeah.&nbsp; I found I developed a high tolerance to doses when I did it every day.&nbsp; It was like tripping was normal and when I didn&#039;t trip it felt like I was tripping. lol

				I believe I have read accounts of people being immune to LSD, I&#039;m not exactly certain of where I came across this information, but I believe it was in the research section of Erowid&#039;s LSD vault which I consider to be a pretty trustworthy source of drug related information.&nbsp;

				While every body reacts slightly differently to things like chemicals, LSD is damn potent as far as these things go. I&#039;ve never heard of someone being immune to a chemical, just highly resistant. I did meet a guy once while hunting for shrooms and we got chatting, him telling me how he&#039;d never been affected much by drugs. I don&#039;t know if he meant they didn&#039;t impact his life and thinking or if they didn&#039;t seem to work, but maybe some people are just unlucky. I suppose bigger folks need more booze to get drunk and fatter people retain THC in their system for longer.<br /><br />The other thing is storage - any idea how the tabs or whatever were kept? Could be the guy had them in the warm or light. I once bought a few tabs from a dodgy fella, so the first two were fine, but the next week when I got to the other two, they did nothing - all degraded by then.

				Yeah, like Psychedelic Oatmeal said, you don&#039;t hear that so much about &quot;losing the magic&quot; from the long-time trippers. You get clubbers who&#039;ve had too much MDMA too regularly over years and it loses its effect, or the heavy smokers who need primo bud or loads more weed than normal to even get high, but LSD tolerance is super quick, in the sense that if you took another dose in an hour, you couldn&#039;t bump it up like with weed or what have you. Besides the new outlook on existence, acid puts you back to normal for the next week. :)

				For me, there is some degree of lost magic if I trip too frequently.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like losing the magic with MDMA, it&#039;s more like I stop feeling like I&#039;m tripping because I get used to being in that plane of existence.&nbsp; It&#039;s no longer a shock to be in that headspace.&nbsp; I find myself with too clear of a prediction of how the experience is going to go and it sort of loses its luster.&nbsp; The longer I wait between dosing, the better each experience is.

				A little info about LSD(maybe some of you have said it already) But i have to get to 50posts again.. So here it goes:<br /><br />1. Dont touch it with your finger(they are wet and absorb much of the lsd from the blotters) And keep them in a dry enviroment and best if it is in the same temp all the time.. Room temp. is fine..<br /><br />2. If you already have taken LSD the other hit is very weak(same goes for taking it to-three days in a row, or many times in a month.. You dont get immune, you get used to it.. Or the brain does at least..<br /><br />3. LSD should never been consumed alone, always mix with ketamine(Or mushrooms) But ketamine gives a very smooth bodyload, and very nice trip! And the shrooms gives quite nice visuals at just 150mcg LSD and 1-3g&#039;s shrooms(depend which kind of shrooms though)<br /><br />4. If it dont work, always wait at least 2hours before hitting one more if its more than 200mcg each blotter! Or you end up getting a very bad vibe suddenly.. because suddenly the first one start working, and then the food maybe that made it start slow have been digisted(spelling problem) and the other hit come almost at the same time as the first, and then it could be 400 or even 500mcg(if the blotters are 250mcg) And that is not too good for everyone :)<br /><br />Just a few hint/tips or what i mean ;)

				Not so sure I agree with all of that info...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Touching blotter with your hands does not degrade the potency of blotter to any discernible degree.&nbsp; If my hands are dripping with water or sweat, obviously I&#039;m not about to touch a sheet of acid.&nbsp; But with normal hands, the small amount of oil we constantly have on our fingertips is not enough to degrade the potency of blotter by any noticeable amount.&nbsp; It is true that room temperature is perfectly adequate for storing LSD.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand what &quot;if you already have taken LSD the other hit is very weak&quot; statement.&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; A week?&nbsp; A month?&nbsp; Forever?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; LSD is fantastic on its own.&nbsp; Absolutely one of the cleanest highs that exists from any drug!&nbsp; Though it is quite nice with ketamine, there is no reason why LSD should not be consumed alone.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; LSD is best dosed all at once.&nbsp; Subsequent redoses rarely increase the intensity of the trip.&nbsp; Typically, they only extend the duration.&nbsp; Obviously, if enough LSD is consumed, the user will notice a definite increase in effects.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to spread out your doses, it&#039;s best to take them all within an hour of each other.&nbsp; The near-instant tolerance associated with LSD use makes redosing virtually a waste in my opinion, unless a longer trip is what you&#039;re going for.<br /><br />No disrespect intended staynice, just putting my views on the subject out there as well!
