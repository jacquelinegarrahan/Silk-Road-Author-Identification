				Well, I could finally FE and i did 23 hours ago. But my package did not arrive today. Is it time to realize that i will never see my bitcoins/product again? I bought from a vendor with nearly 100% positive reviews and an own review thread with great replies in it. It was domestic order and all my other products I ordered&nbsp; had arrived in one day. Shall I wait a few more days? And after the vendor knows my address and name shall I be worried that he&#039;ll come to me threaten me and my family if I complain? Don&#039;t won&#039;t to mess with any of the vendors here so maybe i should just just leave my 5/5 review on his page and pretend that nothing&nbsp; has ever happened and I that I received the product without any problems?<br /><br />(Sry for bad english)

				Give it a day or two. <br />Since you can&#039;t fe before its marked in transit, it obviously wasn&#039;t shipped prior to tthat.&nbsp; You just fe and the next time vendor logs in will see that and (hopefully) ship your shit. So there is going to be another few days in transit. <br /><br />IF you HAVE to finalize early, always write FE Contigent Upon Delivery, then when you get it you can edit your feedback. <br /><br />Try and find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require fe.I don&#039;t have many transactions but have never had to fe. If you do choose one that you must fe, always assume you may get ripped off and don&#039;t risk more than you can afford to lose.

				My experience was that FM used the in Transit just when this actually happened. Not right After the Order.<br />My Problems with that FE is Not really the fact of FE as there are just few i would do so and in Case something gets wrong i assume it was Not the vendors fault. <br />But i hate to read the Reviews as they mean nothing with that FE. <br />Ok you can Look in the Forum but i would prefere a first Real Impression on the listingsite. <br />

				Search the forums for &quot;finalize early&quot;. It&#039;s almost always, always, a bad idea.<br /><br />When you FE, you are prepaying for your product, BEFORE it has arrived.<br /><br />By doing FE, you effectively waive your right to properly resolving any issue that arises down the road. Such as, your product never arriving. <br /><br />This is why &quot;NEVER FE&quot; is written countless times in this forum.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MW

				I know its a Bad idea in generally. Even Face to Face you would<br />Not give your Money to someone saying he Takes the gear around the Block. <br />But. It got commong that some vendors simply Not ship without to New Users or in General. <br />And in H with Not that much Good stuff around and the Good ones dont ship to your area you may have to give it a try After checking Forum etc about the Reputation and try a First small Amount. I guess the Point why H vendors arrived to that point is by the fact of Way to much negative experience. <br />And me Personally. And may sound retard but i Risk the lost of a small Amount of money before iv me a Bad gear. <br />Nevertheless the rule Not to FE i agree fully. But its Not a rule unless it has exeptions. <br />

				Forgot to mention its Not an advice to FE. Its just my own Personally opinion what i am willing and can effort to Risk. Even with a always legit vendor you Never be safe that AT One Point Happens something or just before he decide to quit he will Cash Out once. So as i Said i agree in General with Not FE.

				I am now just one order in (&nbsp; :) ) and aim to keep my initial purchases to minimal amounts so I can build a track record as a responsible customer.&nbsp; If someone beats me, while I will lose initially, the vendor will lose my business forever.&nbsp; I will point that out to them and then finalize to stay out of the possible trouble column.<br /><br />I am very keen though not to do any business that requires FE.&nbsp; I would find another vendor, show you are a good customer and the first vendor will be glad to get your business back.&nbsp; Its a little hard for me not to give the benefit of the doubt but ...<br /><br />Great Site, I am so glad to have found it!<br /><br />Happy Hunting to You All

				Well when I look around my domestic vendors you can be sure that most of them require fe for new customers, that doesn&#039;t leave me much choice when i want to buy at domestics... well atleast i had fe before and the vendor deliveres.

But if you approach them, 99% of them will NOT require FE on you for a very small quantity, because it&#039;s less for them to lose if you flake out. Do this until you build up your stats. Once you have a solid history of buying, and you&#039;ve been on the site for more than a few days, vendors won&#039;t require FE. They&#039;ll realize you have more to lose by scamming them than by being decent; you&#039;ll lose your good stats and have to start all over.

				Thank you for the advice Medicine Woman, Luckily my product arrived today but I will keep this in mind for future transactions. You know it&quot;s kind of difficult for me when someone wants min. 1500$ SR transactions when doing business with him without FE, when you just want to spend a few hundred bucks. Good thing is, my domestic vendors seem to be very trustworthy and all my FE products have all been delivered. <br /><br />Thanks for help and sry for bad English again!
