				I&#039;ve been looking for a way to obtain them through a money order or something of that nature to not much avail, could any of the more experienced folks point me in the right direction to a solid, secure, anonymous vendor? <br /><br />As of right now it&#039;s seeming that my best option is coinbase, however I&#039;m not so sure about directly linking it to my bank account. Seems a bit sketchy. Any and all information is much appreciated. :)

				i met a guy on here from another individual from these forums put me on! he also advertises on localbitcoins which is ok. but this is the quickest iv ever gotten my coins! One of the ways he trades is BofA deposit like BST...difference is this dude is fast he made a joke about me getting btc before getting to my car. i thought he was just screwwing with me,well i had them before i left the parking lot! he has a clearnet website he uses! Let him know a &quot;guy ina forum&quot; told you about him please(he throws me some coin here and there for sending him business)<br /><br /><br />bitman.biz<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;REMEMBER IT CLEARNET AND LEGAL, if you mention SR or drugs or &quot;hey can you help me get these coins to my sr wallet?&quot; <br />if you do anything like that this guy WILL NOT do business with you! So keep it business and so will he! be safe bro<br /><br />OH, his site says no CC yet, thats bullshit he just dont take it from newbs, if you do some trades with him and he knows your not going to try and chargeback he will give you BTC on you credit card no prob.

				Thank you everyone for the great information :). Of course I&#039;d never speak a word about the SR to anyone!<br /><br />What are the pros / cons to buying from either someone in this thread, vs someone locally? Other than accepted methods of payment and $ to BTC rates? <br />

				Campbx is very reliable. I transfer money from Dwolla to my Campbx, as the transfers are instant<br /><br />However, your first transfer will take 30 days to clear. Once this period passes, then you have free instant transfers
