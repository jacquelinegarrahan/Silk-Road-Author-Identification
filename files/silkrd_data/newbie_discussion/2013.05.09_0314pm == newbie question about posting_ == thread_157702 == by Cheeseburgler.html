				Hi guys, newbie question here. I want to post some reviews on some vendors. Is it required that I post here first? I dont see any &quot;reply&quot; or &quot;start new thread&quot; options when I go to the Rumor Mill. Thanks guys!

				You can always post mini-reviews in this newbie section to try to get your post count up to 50. I know that many new guys like me would appreciate it.

				There are a few reasons for 50 posts. To prevent duplicate accounts, to keep LE from mucking about in other parts of the forum without putting in work, and to educate noobs. It&#039;s better than having a bunch of people who have no clue what they&#039;re doing flooding the rest of the forums with silly shit. What sucks is that people spam to 50. I took it as a challenge to get to know the community better and maybe learn a thing or two I don&#039;t know along the way. It&#039;s basically a crash course on being a hard ass G mofuker knowutimsayin dawg?

The same goes for people who are the exact opposites to my first example. They&#039;ll always know when to shout, and when to be humble, regardless of their post count.
