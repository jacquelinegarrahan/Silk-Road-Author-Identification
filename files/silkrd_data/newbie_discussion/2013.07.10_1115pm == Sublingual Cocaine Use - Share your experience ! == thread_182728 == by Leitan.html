				Cocaine is probably my favorite drug.&nbsp; I have never acquired it on SL but can imagine the quality is much higher then my current dealer.<br /><br />Some things to note if you are doing it for the first time.<br />* It&#039;s amazing, there is a strong feeling of euphoria that comes on almost instantly.<br />* It will keep you awake for a little while<br />* It&#039;s hard to stop doing more - what I mean is you may do a little, one or two lines, as you come down you will want to re-up. This is contrary to a drug like LSD where after I start to come down I am just done.<br />* Be careful if you are drinking.&nbsp; You will not feel drunk, nor will you throw up from being WAY too drunk.&nbsp; Most people I know who got sick while doing cocaine got sick from drinking not from the coke.<br />* You don&#039;t feel &quot;fucked up&quot;.&nbsp; The beauty of coke to me is that it is a totally functional drug.&nbsp; Unlike cannabis, MDMA, or alcohol, you will feel almost normal with a lot more energy and ready to take on the world.<br /><br />I recommend splitting a gram with a friend or two on the first night, take it slow. Draw out lines about 2.5 inches long and as thick as an earth worm.&nbsp; Another option is to use a key, just get a small pile on the end of a key and snort that.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little more present but not as much of a rush. Lastly to me one of the best parts of coke is the ceremony around cutting a few lines and drawing them out.<br /><br />Have fun

That&#039;s why I&#039;m asking about experience regarding sub-lingual use of cocaine :)

				I find it to be similar to snorting, but with a slower onset and slightly longer less intense high. Try using an amount similar to what you would rail.

				You can always try to IV it for a different experience? I dont like needles and could never do that but have seen people do it and they swear by it.
