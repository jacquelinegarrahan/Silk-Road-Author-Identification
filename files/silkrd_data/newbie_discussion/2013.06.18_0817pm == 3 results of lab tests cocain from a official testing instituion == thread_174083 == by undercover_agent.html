				further Information: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21439157<br /><br />Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone)-related deaths.<br />Maskell PD, De Paoli G, Seneviratne C, Pounder DJ.<br />Source<br /><br />Centre for Forensic and Legal Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 4HN Scotland, United Kingdom. p.d.maskell@dundee.ac.uk<br />Abstract<br /><br />Four deaths related to the drug 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone) are reported. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of mephedrone was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. Of the four deaths, one was attributed to the adverse effects of mephedrone, with cardiac fibrosis and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease as a contributing factor. A 49-year-old female insufflated mephedrone; analysis disclosed mephedrone in femoral venous blood (0.98 mg/L). The second death was attributed solely to mephedrone. A 19-year-old male took mephedrone as well as alcohol and &quot;ecstasy&quot;; analysis disclosed mephedrone (2.24 mg/L femoral venous blood) and 3-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (3-TFMPP). In the third fatality, a 55-year-old female was found dead in bed; the death was attributed to the combined effects of mephedrone and methadone. Analysis of femoral venous blood revealed the prescribed drugs diazepam, nordiazepam, olazepine, and chlorpromazine metabolites together with methadone (0.3 mg/L) and mephedrone (0.13 mg/L). In the fourth case, a 17-year-old male car driver was involved in a vehicular collision and died of multiple blunt force injuries. Analysis revealed mephedrone in femoral venous blood (0.24 mg/L).

				If you&#039;re not prepared to name the vendors, or state how your analysis compares with Pineapple&#039;s for the same vendor, or even detail your testing methodology/name the &quot;official testing institution&quot; used (both of which Pineapple has done)... and you have very little reputation in these forums...<br /><br />1. why on Earth should anyone listen to you?<br /><br />2. having determined that they should listen to you, what on Earth are people supposed to do with this information?<br /><br />I, for one, conduct my own tests rather than rely on the claims of vendors, Pineapple or anyone else.&nbsp; However, I do use the body of opinion on the forums and in vendor feedback to inform my decisions over which samples to test in the first place.&nbsp; I suspect I&#039;m not alone in this regard.
