				Hello- I would like to share with you about &quot;free&quot; or extremely low cost Bitcoin. I am not a salesperson, I do not represent any of the places I am going to discuss, I am however a fledgling affiliate, but any reward I would get would be etremely meager, I am truly trying to help the community. I fooled around and did a lot of research before I ever got into this stuff, I do not spend a lot and try to find deals where I can. I am not going to make you a million, but you can have some spendable BTC if you follow this simple set of instructions, if you use my affiliate names/links I would be grateful.<br /><br />boozehoundpoker.com is a place where you can complete offers, surveys, games etc for points which you can turn instantly into BTC or Seals With Clubs chips, which can be deposited to your wallet as BTC. You can also get other items, but this is about BTC. If you go to that site, please say you were referred by BDP. I will get&nbsp; a bonus as well as you. If you are willing to do trial offers and perhaps buy things through their site, you can amass a couple of full BTC, even more. I received .5 BTC last night and spent $3.09. I have not yet began to tap the potential, a lot of it is free, I just don&#039;t have the time right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another good way is to go to sealswithclubs.eu with your chips from boozehoundpoker.com and roll them over, if you have any poker skills. I have won as much as 70-80$ worth of coin in a single night and I am a novice player. If you are good then you could take your free chips from boozehoundpoker.com and turn them into real money. There are players there that play at all levels and some tables got into serious money. If you do not already have an account there at seals, I would appreciate it if you used BDP as a reference.<br /><br />That is all I have, compared to the faucets and the other sites for coin, this is a hell of a hustle and fun too. You also will get a chance to meet some cool people from around the world as well.&nbsp;
