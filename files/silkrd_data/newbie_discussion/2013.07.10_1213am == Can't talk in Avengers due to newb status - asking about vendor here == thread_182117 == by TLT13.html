				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to order from HollandOnline soon for my first Lucy trip. I&#039;ve already ordered some testing reagent as well. I have a few questions though:<br /><br />1) How sure can I be I&#039;m taking LSD after using a reagent? I&#039;ve read that sometimes the test is pretty weak even if it is LSD (barely any pink for example).<br /><br />2) Any experience with HollandOnline. Can someone confirm it&#039;s the real deal? He seems to be getting a few positive trip reports, but there is also speculation on reddit it&#039;s Nbome. I have no experience with psychedelics so I won&#039;t be able to tell by using it. I&#039;d really like legit LSD, no bunk shit. No offense to HollandOnline of course, but I hope my concern is understood as I&#039;m new to SR and new to psychedelics.<br /><br />3) I see on several topics he says he&#039;s been approved as an OKAY vendor by the Avengers. But if I look in the avengers OP, I don&#039;t see him in there, at all, not under okay or bad or star vendors? Any explanation to this?<br /><br />Thanks for answering! Looking forward to my trip.

				Thank you so much for the personal reply =) <br /><br />I already also messaged another person in the Avengers thread who I saw mentioning labtests and he indeed confirmed for 113ug. I was going to order from your store today at 1600, but I see you need a bit more time =) Just a bit cautious since it&#039;ll be my first SR order and my first trip, so that&#039;s why I ask so many questions, sorry!<br /><br />You can expect an order from me for 5 tabs as soon as you are up tomorrow! Looking forward to it!
