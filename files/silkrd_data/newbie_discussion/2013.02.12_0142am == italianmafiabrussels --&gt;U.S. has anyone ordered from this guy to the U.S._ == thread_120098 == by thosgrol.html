				I ordered the day before you posted this, and it was sent out the day after. I should have a review up for the molly (in bulk) in about a week if all goes well&nbsp; 8)

				Received 10g in exactly a week. I&#039;m seriously impressed at the stealth. There wasn&#039;t a DCN, but it&#039;s hard to imagine the goods not arriving. The man is a professional. Some chunks appear a little darker like his profile pictures show and there&#039;s a lot of light light brown, tan, crystally, powdery consistency when it&#039;s broken up. Have heard great things from a friend or two who have taken it, one saying that 150mg is giving at least a few hours of STRONG and therapeutic properties, and was tied to his bed for a while haha.<br /><br />This same friend who generally requires much more than I was even going as far as to say that 130mg would be a little more recommended but that he did want it to be much longer (and thus had the urge to redose). I don&#039;t have any idea how that would turn out yet, but I will update when someone goes on a binge lmao. The quality is Definitely there, I have not done a reagent test like several others on here (who said it passed with flying colors!) but the taste is enough to let me know it is definitively MDMA. The smell is nice. This vendor is legit. <br /><br />Edit: I&#039;m not a fan of the new FE requirement for non-EU, but he says it is temporary -- I hope that&#039;s true because I really want to place more orders!! That factor drove me to buy in the first place&nbsp; :P
