				Title: <strong>Buying Pills on SR...</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hey! <br /><br />So I&#039;m really new here and a friend online showed me this place because I&#039;m having trouble getting my doctor to prescribe pain medication. I am in chronic pain and it sux majorly.<br /><br />Anyway, I want to order something with oxycodone in it and possibly so diaudid tabs for major breakthrough pain. I&#039;m wondering if its better to do 1 order that will last me 3months or order monthly? What is going to reduce my chances of getting a CD the most?<br /><br />Also the location where the delivery would go - my friend is living there so if she picks up the package I don&#039;t want her arrested for it. So how can I avoid that completely?<br /><br />Help is much appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />PS: I&#039;ve also been reading these forums so - I&#039;ve got a bit of knowledge on all this.

				I&#039;m not a huge veteran here but it seems to me that if you order from a well established and highly reputable vendor and you provide them with a PGP encrypted, properly formatted, correct address with matching name, your chances of invoking legal troubles are pretty miniscule. And if that vendor is domestic, I think you&#039;re even safer. A lot of these vendor accounts have hundreds of transactions and they don&#039;t get there by using shitty packaging or other shoddy security. Also I would assume based on what I&#039;ve read that controlled deliveries are pretty fucking rare. Maybe some knowledgeable folks can back me up here?

				It&#039;s SR and ordering smaller packages is probly safer but some vendors have incredible stealth for large packages.

				i guess it depends if the offer lettermail or package as shipping. Message the vendor about there shipping techniques although they wont divulge too much and look at their feedback and see what customers say about their stealth.

				most domestic vendors dont have prerequisites for their customers. They might just have a pill limit for first-timers that will go away after an order or 2

				So, I just wanted to update you all and let you know I was able to find a domestic vendor to send me what I needed without requiring me to FE. The transaction was smooth and wonderful and I have been pain free for a few days now because of what I got and THAT is a blessing.
