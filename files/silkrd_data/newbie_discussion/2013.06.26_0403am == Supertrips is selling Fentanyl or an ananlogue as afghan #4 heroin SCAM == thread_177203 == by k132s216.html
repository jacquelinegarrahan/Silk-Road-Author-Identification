				I&#039;m sure many of you are familiar with the vendor supertrips. A few months ago my friend ordered a gram of &quot;supertrips #4 heroin&quot; from UGS a domestic reseller of supertrips products. We split that gram and after a couple of days of using it we were both thoroughly convinced we had not been sold heroin but fentanyl. Over the next two months I began to see reports on the SR forums and in supertrips feedback that he was selling fentanyl as h. I assumed supertrips just picked up a couple bad batches and decided to order another gram of supertrips &quot;afghan #4 heroin&quot; hoping i&#039;d actually get heroin at his great price (little wonder how he sells a gram for so cheap). Well a couple days ago I received it and immediately marquis reagent tested the product. To my dismay the test was negative for heroin, MAM, or morphine. That&#039;s right there wasn&#039;t a single molecule of actual heroin in the gram of powder I was sold. Selling fentanyl as heroin is extremely dangerous. I contacted him asking for a full refund and sr support asking them to make him take down his listings for &quot;afghan #4 heroin&quot; he still has up.

				some of the stuff on the street that people called china white was heroin cut with fentanyl.<br />if you know your dope then its easy to tell,fentanyl is a very short strong high(2 hours) with none of the euphoria <br />that heroin has and h is 6-8 hour high.<br />its a super douche bag thing to do, to sell fent as heroin because you can kill people.

				I already read about this in this vendors&#039; feedback. Go back several pages when you research vendors, people. I did read about someone overdosing. I also heard this person is very upset when he gets any negative messages or messages inquiring about his product being fent. Please note, this is just what I have heard and read, no personal experience. However, the feedback I read has already prevented me from ordering from this person.&nbsp; I do love fent, but not in this form.&nbsp; And fent should definitely not be sold as H.

				Yeah he get&#039;s really defensive if you send him a message about this. I really just wish the mods gave a shit but they don&#039;t because he moves such volume and they get a percentage of that. He&#039;s dropped from 97 when I made this thread to 95 now so atleast some people are catching on

				Regent test negative for heroin here also , I feel like a fool I was warned read etc , I gave the vender the benefit of his history , messaged him told him I had a very bad reaction to prescribed fentanly I have patches here from the doctor that I can not use , another member told me he had just received a really decent batch from supertrips and I should not worry that he just had a bad batch it was not the same ,<br />I ordered and here I sit with 5.5 grams of shit I can&#039;t use , I had a feeling when Frank M was not responding I should just wait and not send my $ or just stick with Tar well now I am SOL .<br /><br />I have not released my funds I have asked for 100% refund and to just send this crap back I will post here all replies from ST or SR .<br />GF
