On Wednesday july 3rd on there seller page they write &quot;orders this week took some time to go out all have been shipped sorry for inconvenience.&quot; Being 4th of july i didnt have time to email him so i email him on this friday july 5th no response as through the whole weekend. <br /><br />What should I do? the resolve button wont be open for few more days<br /><br />Please help me I am very nervous

				Don&#039;t sweat it man. It&#039;s still the foutrth of July weekend, most vendors are out having a life right now too; I actually had to cancel a order on a (100) vendor due to them being away. <br /><br />If your package has been marked in transit, it is on it&#039;s way, don&#039;t sweat it, especially if its from GOD. ;)<br />You also have to remember that mail doesn&#039;t move AT ALL during the 4th of July. <br /><br />Hope I eased some your worriess.<br />DD

				sounds like you ordered from a reputable, trusted vendor.&nbsp; I would just hold for now.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t received a response by the time your resolve option is open, then you should allow SR to take appropriate action.&nbsp;
