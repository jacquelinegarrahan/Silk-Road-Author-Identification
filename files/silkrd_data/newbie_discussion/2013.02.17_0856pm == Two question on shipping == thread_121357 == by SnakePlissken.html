				Hi all, soon to be first time buyer, cant wait to use this. Two questions if anyone can help. Number one, I&#039;ve recently moved into my house and receive mail all the time from past residents who used to live in my house. Would it be safe to use any of these persons name instead of mine when giving my address? I have no connection to them whatsoever so I figure it will be safe but wondered if anyone has done this. <br /><br />Also I have a problem with my mail man, after 3 different attempts with ordering from ebay/amazon/etc, when it comes to large packages. He will not deliver them to my house but rather be lazy and bring it back to the post office. Doesn&#039;t even leave the tag that tells me he attempted delivery and here&#039;s when he&#039;ll try again or bring this tracking # to post office blah blah blah. Every time I&#039;ve been smart enough to track those packages as they are in transit and saw &quot;attempted delivery&quot; or whatever the message was so I would know to go pick them up. So second question is, do sellers usually ship in something that can fit in a mailbox, or do they use boxes? I&#039;m just worried a box being shipped here would cause a few problems, it wouldn&#039;t get delivered, it would spend more time then needed with the mail man and post office, and I will eventually need to go to the post office to pick it up. <br /><br />Thanks for the help guys, really can&#039;t wait to use this site.

				Make sure you have an official standard post office box and if your mailman doesn&#039;t deliver standard usps packages that fit the box then complain to the postmaster general (or you local post office).

				You say that every time you order a package, the mailman wont deliver it and makes you go to the post office?... <br /><br />So what happens if you order something: <br />- and even though it&#039;s a very small package, the lazy mail worker doesn&#039;t want to carry it around and makes you go to the post office.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have an ID saying you are that person.<br />- and the shipper doesn&#039;t put it in a very small package.&nbsp; Once again, you don&#039;t have the proper ID to obtain that package.<br />- your package is intercepted by a postal inspector, and a controlled delivery is made. (From what I&#039;ve read, not all CD&#039;s make you sign... they may just leave it there)&nbsp; You just accepted a package in someone else&#039;s name (maybe it was just left there), and probably opened it.&nbsp; You now look much more guilty than if you just opened a package in your own name.&nbsp; For one, you committed a federal offense opening up someone else&#039;s mail... two, you opening it strengthens the state&#039;s case that you had prior knowledge to what was in that package. (since you took the risk of committing a federal offense opening it)&nbsp; &nbsp;Google people getting busted for mailing drugs etc., read their stories.<br /><br />I too can get stuff mailed in the previous occupant&#039;s name... but I decided against that route.&nbsp; Maybe in other countries this is the way to go, but Imo not here in the US.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve read in news stories that they have devices that they will put in the boxes to alert them when it is opened... so I&#039;m not so sure letting it just sit there for a couple days will save you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately it&#039;s up to you, it&#039;s your butt on the line...&nbsp; &nbsp;

It&#039;s one thing to get junk mail or regular mail addressed to previous occupants, but it would be strange for them to start receiving packages. It will also become apparent quite quickly from your regular mail that you are the actual person who lives there, especially if you have Netflix or GameFly or something like that. If you are getting packages from eBay / Amazon / whatever in your actual name, that makes the packages addressed to the previous tenant even more conspicuous. Lastly, if you just moved there, you get to create your own parcel history, by which I mean that if you start ordering packages right from the start, it won&#039;t seem unusual since that&#039;s all the postman has ever known. That will be far less suspicious than someone who has lived somewhere for a while without many parcels but then suddenly starts getting 29 boxes a day from California and The Netherlands. <br /><br />There&#039;s no one sure-fire answer for anything, but I&#039;d recommend not using a previous tenant. And as you mentioned, if they ever decide to get proper forwarding, you&#039;ll have no way of knowing, and at best you&#039;ll just not receive your package. <br /><br />However, if you do decide to use the previous tenant, I&#039;d also advise against sending yourself fake letters to test. If you&#039;re receiving previous mail, then the test has already been done for you. That also means a longer window of time where you&#039;re risking that they set up proper forwarding.<br /><br />Regarding the size, all of my experiences have been with a Priority Flat Rate Box or smaller. That fits in most boxes I would think. It also fits in my mine, but my mailman leaves my packages by my door for some reason anyway.... but it sounds like your mailman may not even do that...<br /><br />Good luck. Stay Safe.
