				Im completely new to SR and last week I decided to give the road a shot due to the increase of danger in my area of the us from drug violence/ fake drugs containing dangerous chemicals. I wont give out details of where Im from but im in the heart of America rural area. I decided to try three different susbstances small orders at first. MDMA, LSD, and Special K. I already wrote a review on my experience with KharmaPharma which was the shit! I looked around SR for a while in order to find a vendor who was selling 1 hit of lsd and quickly found norcalking he was selling them individually for really cheap and advertising 175-200ug. Alot of bang for the buck as advertised! I checked out his profile and i believe he was moe of a cannabis vendor if anything and probably just came across a good batch of lsd. The price was .23 bitcoins before the inflation hit and i had exactly .23 so i thought hell no problen and i began to try and order it. Well i guess because of something with the rounding of bitcoins you always gotta have .01 more then what the price is in your account. Discouraged I decided to write Norcalking and ask if i could just transfer the .23 in his account and give him my details on the side. He wrote back within 5 minutes and said no problem we exchanged info and then out of nowhere a buddy I was discussing this to earlier transferred .01 in my account without telling me so I had exactly what I needed. I wrote back norcal and explained to him the situation and apologized and i can only imagine he was getting annoyed with me at this point but still remained very polite. I ordered through sr on sunday and by thursday it was here! Perfectly packaged almost too much stealth if thats possible! Now to the good part so yesterday at 11am I decided i wanted to go for a hike by myself and try this new acid. The tab was perfect size with perforatted edges and had a partial part of a design but couldnt make it out and orange in color. I got to the park and laid it under my tounge and began to go for a nice stroll within 30 minutes my life fucking changed!!! Thats the only i can describe this monumental life changing event. This tiny little tab was so fucking jam packed ive never ever seen anything like this!!! The visuals were so intense and this was the most uplifting spiritual and cheerful lsd i thing man has ever seen. Im not blowing smoke up your ass either ive done quite a bit of lsd and this was just extremely top notch quality. It was like taking a handful of x and throwing some visuals in there. Very relaxing and peaceful and just full of love i tripped for 8 hours straight and the comedown was not bad at all couldnt sleep for another 6 hours after but hands down best lsd ive ever had

				I am trying my first overseas order for LSD from HollandOnline. I got some from a Canadian vendor that went AWOL and it was amazing. I am hopeful this stuff will be also.
