				Any advice? I&#039;ve read reviews on here and reddit that call this vendor a selective scammer, so I basically want it over with as soon as possible. I heard he&#039;ll draw it out, but I&#039;d rather not. All of his other orders arrive to eu under five days. It&#039;s been 11 for me. I&#039;m sure they aren&#039;t coming and I haven&#039;t gotten a letter from customs.<br /><br />What should I do? I didn&#039;t finalize early. But I4d really like my money back. On the page it says 25% refund to EU. So I assume that&#039;s the most I can get?<br /><br />Annoyed, I didn&#039;t even choose this vendor. My friend did and then I fronted the money. Argh.

				aaaww buddy I feel bad for you. All I can say is check the feedback so well and if you have the slightest bad feeling about a seller don not order. Also in life, and buying drugs, I have always found that if it looks too good to be true then it probably is. we have all been ripped off on the street and sadly we wil all probably be ripped off here eventually you just have to take it on the chin.<br />

Had a guy tell me once, after letting me test some &#039;coke&#039;, that it usually takes &quot;at least fifteen minutes to kick in.&quot;<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll just be sure to leave scathing feedback so everyone knows what a dishonest thief he is.&nbsp; :(

				I have a somewhat similar problem, the vendor i bought from has very good stats, and last time i bought something i had no problem, I can see in the feedback that several others have not recieved their order, but they seem content with a 25-50% refund. <br />But I am not happy with that, since i have a feeling that is what they was their plan in the first place.... <br />

				It&#039;s a crapshoot for newbies, don&#039;t be afraid to ask them questions, if they don&#039;t want to work with you, move on. Everyone gets scammed sometime so don&#039;t feel like the Lone Ranger.<br /><br />Hope you find some solid vendors. Good luck..

				Recent events with one of my orders is shaping up to be in doubt of being successfully completed.<br />I sure hope this is not the case but nothing has arrived yet.<br /><br />I do not recommend using any vendor who does not provide tracking information to their customer, or must only send the tracking number to the customer if it is PGP-encrypted and sent through the secure SR messaging system set up for vendor pms. <br /><br />Be wary of any vendor who claims delivery was completed without also providing the tracking number so you can independently check it out, or says anything that does not agree with what you are seeing in your mailbox every day, such as the need for &quot;pickup&quot; slips, when other orders are being delivered successfully into the same mailbox.<br /><br />Recommendation - Many vendors provide tracking numbers while in transit, so you can keep an eye on when it will hit your box. Those vendors I think are more customer oriented, and you should give them repeat business.<br /><br />Caution! Newbies should stick to domestic vendors to avoid possible problems with international deliveries. Ignore this at your peril, and also -- never FE.<br /><br />I will update this situation as conditions warrant. I sure hope this is not a dud deal.<br />

				by &#039;domestic&#039; do we mean within EU for EU? Because if we mean in the country, that&#039;s not even an option for me.<br /><br />and good luck! I&#039;m definitely going to start shelling out more for tracking and things.

				You don&#039;t say who the vendor was. As a fellow newb, I would like to know. While I don&#039;t live in EU and only order from domestic, I only want the &quot;selective scammer&quot; to be publicly named so others can avoid it. (BTW I do not understand selective scammer, if they scam they are scum, period)<br />If I&#039;ve somehow missed the name (and item), sorry. Information is power. As we all know newbs are all but powerless. Admins side with vendors in most cases when it&#039;s newb vs. vendor. Perhaps justifiably but since this is not a public service we all know we use SR at our own risk.<br />Do your research, talk to people, make first orders from new vendors (new to you) small, and NEVER NEVER NEVER FE. haven&#039;t been ripped off (yet) but have had to cancel some orders and had some orders cancelled. Live and learn. It&#039;s just like gambling, never risk more than you can afford to lose and all ways check the deck!<br /><br />Good luck titoprince. Do not hold one bad experience against everyone.<br />kahn&nbsp;

				I have 10 more days so I&#039;m waiting to see what happens.&nbsp; Will keep checking my box.<br /><br />To clarify - Don&#039;t place an order with a vendor outside your country especially a newbie.

				Here is how it works:<br /><br />A package is sent requiring a signature, to an incorrect address in your zip code. You receive the tracking number and when you look it up it has arrived at your local post office. You will then see something with your zip code is being held at the PO. It says the delivery is not secure and you have a locked box for mail with lots of room for large pkgs. It says a notice was left and you but you never receive a pickup notice. When you go down to the PO they can&#039;t find it. They take your name, phone no, and address along with the tracking number and leave it for the carrier. Then you check the tracking again and it was returned to the sender a few hours after your visit to the post office.<br /><br />
