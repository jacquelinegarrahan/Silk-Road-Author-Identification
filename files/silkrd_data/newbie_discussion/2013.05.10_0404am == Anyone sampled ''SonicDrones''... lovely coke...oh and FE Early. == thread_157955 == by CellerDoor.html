				Well i ordered from mr sonicdrone.....without reading up on him......why??? when im an experienced user of sr (over 40 transactions) i ant answer....but hell here goes...<br /><br />placed an order with said vendor on tuesday...waited a couple of days and nothing had happened...order still in processing, so messaged him saying is it possible to post it as i wanted something for saturday...responded politely and quickly saying yes would be posted thurs morning. I checked at noon and hadnt been posted so messaged again, eventually he said to me if i sent £10 (GBP) worth of btc he would guarantee it was with me for sat....stupidly i sent him 0.05 btc as i had some spare. When fri came and it still hadnt been posted (around 5pm) sent him a message asking to cancel the order...funny thing happend an 3=4 afrer i sent the message order was changed to &#039;&#039;in transit&#039;....suspicioous?? u bet i was. Anyways saturday post came and went and nothing arrived, and i dont hold up hope of something coming.<br /><br />i can prove i sent the message asking to cancel before he changed the order to &#039;in transit&#039; and know for certain i dont have a hope in hell of getting that extra i sent him, just hope something arrives as hes now ignoring messages etc etc

				Stick to reputable vendors that don&#039;t require FE.<br /><br />On a side note, saying &quot;FE early&quot; doesnt make any sense... it&#039;s redundant. You&#039;re saying you finalized early early :P

				Yeah, I ordered the same stuff. Didn&#039;t arrive. I wanted to extend to see if it turned up but he wanted me to either take a 25% refund or 50% reship. I took the reship (on his condition of finalizing), and needless to say it didn&#039;t arrive. If it&#039;s as shit as some people say, that may be a good thing&nbsp; :-\
