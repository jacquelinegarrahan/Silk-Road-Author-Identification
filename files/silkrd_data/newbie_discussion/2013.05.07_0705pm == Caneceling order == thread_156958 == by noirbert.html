				I have a order that is still processing- the Cancel option just came up and I am thinking I would like to abort this order. I had messaged the vendor last night but have yet to hear from him. The vendor is a good vendor I guess by review alone at least, but still this isn&#039;t cool especially with the decline of bitcoin. <br /><br /><br />The order is in a hedge fund though, will I get all of the money I put into the order when I cancel it, or will I be effected by the decline? <br /><br />If someone could quickly let me know I would really appreciate it.&nbsp; This has been preventing me from making another order for sometime now. <br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;m in the same boat. Is it TopNotch? If it&#039;s hedged then you&#039;ll get the same amount in dollars back. It could be more or less BTC than from when you bought them, but it will amount to what you paid for them

				Thanks. <br /><br />Yeah I am pretty sure its hedge, so I should get the usd amount back I take it, that would be put me at in a bit of relief. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;The vendor isn&#039;t Topnotch, though it is a well reputed cannabis vendor that&nbsp; I wanted to try out but. At least he didn&#039;t put the order through right away so I couldn&#039;t cancel it, I hope to hear from him soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the quick reply - Hope all goes well with your order&#039;s and time here on the road. <br /><br />Cheeers everyone <br />
