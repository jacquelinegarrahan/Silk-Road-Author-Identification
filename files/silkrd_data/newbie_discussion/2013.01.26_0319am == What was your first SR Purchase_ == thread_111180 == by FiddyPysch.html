				Its a memorable thing, both the insane excitement and fear packaged together. I just put in my first orders for An Eighth of Weed and 100mg of 2C-B. Just getting my feet wet. <br /><br />(I guess technically my first purchases were the 7 E-books I bought to get past FE status with vendors. But whatever)<br /><br /><br /><br />What about you guys?

				I ordered a ball from ST right before the shit storm that occurred in september. I was one of the lucky ones to receive my order though :D<br /><br />In the meantime I called bullshit on the process, but just to make sure, I ordered a quarter from two different vendors and didn&#039;t think it was for real, but hey, what was 50 bucks? 5 days later I get mail and god damn, it&#039;s there. Then I went ballistic on everything knowing I had found a gold mine. Haven&#039;t left since :D

				I ordered a couple stamp bags from deluxedelivery yesterday around noon... still waiting for it to change from processing to in transit (pressing refresh every half hour at minimum)<br /><br />Right now im on suboxone, so the really annoying thing is that I&#039;m going to have to be off these for around 72 hours. I&#039;m literally watching for it to change to &#039;in transit&#039; so I can stop taking these things... but to be safe I&#039;m waiting until like 10PM to even take it so if it arrives two days later I can sample immediately... smh.... what a life.<br /><br />I had some change left over and I wasn&#039;t able to find any super cheap single dose xanax so I ordered a norco as well. Can&#039;t wait!

				I got a hash edible, enough shrooms and LSD for two trips each, and some Xanax because I was told it can be handy coming down from the psychedelics.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably going to take me several months to go through all of it, but I&#039;m looking forward!&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try the hash first thing, since I can do it without having TONS of time set aside.<br /><br />Also, it was my first set of purchases, all from separate vendors, and I wasn&#039;t asked to FE by anyone except for a vendor who said I wouldn&#039;t have to after a PM exchange. So far SR has been a great experience.

				My first orders were MDMA from several vendors, and 2CB... Received all of them quickly. I&#039;ve ordered a few more times and so far successfully, except for one order where I received underweight, but I am waiting to resolve with the seller.
