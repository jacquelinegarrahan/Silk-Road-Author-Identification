				I had placed an order with a vendor a few weeks back, and haven&#039;t received it yet. I messaged him about this, and he&#039;s asking me to message him back with my address so that he can reship. Is this safe for me to do? I haven&#039;t&nbsp; been using SR for very long, but I always thought that your address was safe because when you&#039;re placing an order, the information gets erased after finalizing... but that doesn&#039;t happen with messages.

				NO!&nbsp; this is what LE would do if they busted someone and got access to their account.&nbsp; Just cancel the order and re-order with a new vendor.<br />

				It could be valid, seller might just be wanting to make sure it gets sent to the right person. At the minimum the vendor would need the tx#, then I guess he could unencrypt your address from the order if it is still there. Check the vendor&#039;s recent feedback to see how things are coming in. If it hasn&#039;t been marked in-transit you can cancel the order. But I&#039;m guessing it has been. Your other option would be to say no thanks on the reship, just refund my money please, and then force it to the resolution center if necessary.
