				I just want to start a discussion on whether a buyer feedback system would be plausible, so as to protect vendors from possible scammer&#039;s. I understand that there are buyer stats but numbers often do not paint an entire picture. <br /><br />Please just serious responses.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This already has been implemented on Atlantis and to my knowledge it is working well.

				This is definitely an awesome feature about ATL.&nbsp; However, buyer stats are difficult in that it is quite easy to ditch a buyer account after a bad review.&nbsp; Plus, we want to encourage people to retain the same buyer account to at least some extent.&nbsp; A single bad review on a buyer profile is likely to scare a hell of a lot more vendors away when compared to say a 5% refund rate.&nbsp; Buyers feel safe keeping the same accounts here because their buyer stats aren&#039;t revealed unless they initiate a transaction.&nbsp; And even more so, it&#039;s numeric and impersonal data.<br /><br />Anyway... I think SR&#039;s lack of buyer feedback works well.&nbsp; It makes it much more of a market place and less of an ebay.&nbsp; Atlantis is a lot more like ebay then a marketplace at the moment, but that may change as it continues to grow and age (and the vendor buy-ins increase).

				I can&#039;t say this would make it very easy for first time buyers though (as if they&#039;re not paranoid enough)
