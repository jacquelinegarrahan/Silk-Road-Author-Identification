				I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because they are using escrow hedging ... which has a fee.&nbsp; In the future, if you&#039;re worried about it, you can use a vendor that doesn&#039;t use escrow hedging (it will tell you when you add an item to your cart).

				Yes it&#039;s the hedging fees which are about 4% if I am not mistaken.

				If they&#039;re using escrow hedging, then you get the same amount back in USD as you initially paid ... which could be less BTC if the BTC price has risen.

				sure it is recommended, but with the price of BTC going up and up and up and it is almost a rarity to see anyone hedged.&nbsp; &nbsp;would you?&nbsp; &nbsp; having said that, when btc where 10 bucks almost everyone was hedged.&nbsp; &nbsp;some folks have quadrupled their earnings on here simply by NOT cashing out.&nbsp; think about that for a minute.
