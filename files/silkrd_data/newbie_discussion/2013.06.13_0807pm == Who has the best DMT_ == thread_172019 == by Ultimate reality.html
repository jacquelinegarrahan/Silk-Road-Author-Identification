				I do!&nbsp; Seriously though, I stand behind that statement.&nbsp; Best prices too.&nbsp; I&#039;m a new vendor.&nbsp; However I already have an order, and by next week I should have some reviews for you to better judge me by.

				@ Fractalbliss and Ringo..... I&#039;ll tell you what, I will be ordering from both of you! I will check your pages and see what else you both have to offer as well. Im not really the type that would jump from vendor to vendor especially if you have everything I need. I appreciate you both!

				US I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />For EU I tried almost all of the DMT vendors and for now IMO the best is Multi-Exciter as for quality vs. price. Still have to try some though (as Vatican, ChemDog and a new one, JeffBob I think he is called).<br /><br />Anyway as RogerPete said the difference on the top ones (all the good vendors mentioned in the Deemster thread are top) is very small and they have all good products. It then also depends on if you want to buy bulk or not and if you prefer white or yellow (I much prefer N-N-DMT than DMT-N-Oxide for example).<br /><br />I would like to try all of them (even those of the US) and make a sort of personal chart on differences etc. and post a thread about it but many of them don&#039;t ship internationally (and I can understand it).<br /><br />Well... what can I say? DMT is my passion. I have always been interested in psychedelics and their link with occultism from a young age and since I discovered DMT it was love at first sight. You can do really EVERYTHING with the help of DMT concerning OBEs/NDEs and things related with a power that you cannot have normally, neither after years of experience on those things as I have.

I sell a whole g for the price he is selling .5.&nbsp; Plus I would do the Pepsi challenge against his stuff any day of the week.&nbsp; Seriously,&nbsp; I wish we could have a contest on the Deemster thread or something.&nbsp; Put an end to it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I set the prices to reflect demand.&nbsp; When I first started my prices were as low or lower than yours as well.&nbsp; As demand went up I had to raise the prices because I work a full time job and this is a one man show here.&nbsp; I have a life and I like to keep it that way.<br /><br />As for as quality goes, you want to do a Pepsi challenge?&nbsp; So what your saying is your product has a higher purity than mine?&nbsp; Alright, let&#039;s say your product is 99% pure, while mine is 97.6% pure (which I test regularly on HPLC to ensure batch to batch consistency).&nbsp; That is a difference of 1.4%.&nbsp; That means if someone tokes 50mgs of my product, they would ONLY need to toke 49.3mgs of your product to give the same effect.&nbsp; Think about it...negligible difference.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you have a great product and all, and I&#039;m not going to sit here and make baseless claims about the purity of your product.<br /><br />We all provide a service here for the people, we all do it our own way.&nbsp; I wish you well in your new vendor journey.<br /><br />--RP--<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey man,&nbsp; I respect and hear what your saying.&nbsp; However, I have a life as well and I have as much on my plate as the next man.&nbsp; I am a one man show as well,&nbsp; and trust me I can understand the stress it takes to do this.&nbsp; I have a code I like to live by though,&nbsp; and I feel that price gouging the customer is not gonna get me anywhere.&nbsp; I only sell quality DMT,&nbsp; the kind of quality that I would give to my best friend.&nbsp; Anything else is unacceptable.&nbsp; I just believe that it shouldn&#039;t all be about the profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are right,&nbsp; we ALL do a provide a service, and your service is no less than mine.&nbsp; Thank you, and same sentiments to you and your journey as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for understanding.&nbsp; I too don&#039;t believe in price gouging, but I do believe in providing a great product to the people.&nbsp; At one point I was getting too many orders to fill and thus staying up until 4am regularly to accomplish this.&nbsp; I was not getting much done at my M-F 9-5 job because I was too tired to think.&nbsp; I had 3 options at that point:&nbsp; Raise prices to buffer incoming orders, hire people to help me (completely out of the question), quit my day job (completely out of the question), or only sell a limited amount each week so I had enough time to deal with it.&nbsp; The only option that makes much sense is to price the product to meet the demand I can deal with, with the amount of extra time I have available.&nbsp; <br /><br />The associated risks involved with what we do as vendors are pretty extreme.&nbsp; The amount of money I make will never justify the risks I take.&nbsp; How does one set a &quot;fair&quot; price for a product such as DMT?&nbsp; What is a fair price?&nbsp; In my opinion, the market sets it&#039;s own price based on what the people will pay.&nbsp; As long as there are multiple vendors, there will always be a balance between the vendors with setting price so as to not get either overwhelmed with orders or no orders at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />You talk about selling &quot;only quality DMT, the kind I would give to my best friend.&quot;&nbsp; I still don&#039;t know if you understand about purity/potency.&nbsp; I would gamble that the all of the top DMT vendors here have a product which is well over 90% pure.&nbsp; At that point, the differences become negligible.&nbsp; Sure, one may be white, one may be yellow, or various shades in between.&nbsp; One may contain traces of various related alkaloids, while another may contain only 1 impurity, depending on the route taken to create this material.&nbsp; The point I&#039;m getting at is the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; you brought up:&nbsp; You think your product would win against mine &quot;any day of the week&quot;?&nbsp; There is no winning once you have a high purity product, it&#039;s more or less the same.&nbsp;

Besides reputation (assuming we all have great ones!), price is the main factor for deciding who to purchase from.&nbsp; Of course we all have our regulars, but the amount of orders from customers with little to no buying history is quite large relative to the regulars or seasoned ones...<br /><br />I don&#039;t consider this price gouging.&nbsp; I consider this letting the market set it&#039;s price (which is directly related to the amount of time I&#039;m willing to spend each day doing this)&nbsp; I don&#039;t think your analogy with Six Flags charging $3.00 for a water has anything to do with this.&nbsp; That is a situation where the park goers have no choice but to buy water for $3.00.&nbsp; Water is a necessity of life and people are basically forced to buy it (assuming the water fountains have barely drinkable water...)&nbsp; There is no competition in this sense.&nbsp; They could charge $8.00 and people would still have to buy it.&nbsp; I cannot just charge $400/g and expect to have any customers.&nbsp; If I had a monopoly vender-ship (just like Six Flags supplying water to it&#039;s customers) and no one had a choice but to buy from me and I had the price at $400, then I would agree, that would definitely, with out a question, be price gouging (excluding the why&#039;s of there not being any other competitors).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Yes you are probably right about all the top DMT vendor&#039;s purity being above 90%,&nbsp; but your idea of anything beyond that being negligible could not be further from the truth.&nbsp; Any student of chemistry will know that the the purity beyond the 90% mark matters the most.&nbsp; That is where the magic really takes place, especially for DMT.&nbsp; Even 1 or 2% is a huge leap in experiences imho.&nbsp; When I say quality I would give my best friend I mean beyond the 90% standard.&nbsp; Other vendors may be satisfied with that, but I&#039;m not.&nbsp; I believe there is a fine line between good, and exceptional.&nbsp; I like to hover around exceptional.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suppose we somewhat agree here.&nbsp; But then not much.&nbsp; A student of chemistry?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing chemistry for 10 years in a professional setting and I can tell you that nobody can tell between 2 batches of the same drug with a 1% potency difference.&nbsp; Alright, 10%, yes.&nbsp; People can tell between DMT which is 90% pure and 99.99% pure.&nbsp; Probably true with most drugs (depending on the persons awareness).&nbsp; I suppose we are back to this potency thing.&nbsp; If I weighed out 50 mgs of my DMT and you smoked a hit, do you think you could tell the difference between doing a 48 mg hit? In terms of translation to a purity thing:&nbsp; assume your stuff is 100% pure and mine is 96% pure.&nbsp; That means that 50mg of mine=48mgs of yours, ie yours is 4% more potent.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anyone who can tell the difference between a 48mg hit and a 50mg hit.&nbsp; If you can then more power to you, I&#039;m would bet someone out there is in tune enough to be able to distinguish this. I just don&#039;t understand how 1-2% could be a &quot;huge leap&quot; in experiences...lets bump the bar down and look at a different angle.&nbsp; Suppose my material is 72% pure and yours is 73% pure.&nbsp; Could you tell the difference?&nbsp; What about 85% and 86%?&nbsp; 90 and 91?&nbsp; Do you see where I am going with this?&nbsp; Just because the product is getting closer to 100% pure doesn&#039;t mean it has some sort of exponential blast curve towards DMT world, the experience more depends on how much DMT is going into your system (and other possible contaminants), not how pure that DMT is.&nbsp; What if you loaded up 150mgs of 85% (purity) DMT?&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be a much wilder ride then hitting 80mgs of 99.999999%.&nbsp; I suppose I&#039;m just asking for you to help me better understand what you are saying.<br /><br />I as well agree that quality product has got to be &gt;90%, and I will go ahead and bump that to &gt;95%.&nbsp; If it&#039;s &gt;99% then that&#039;s top notch stuff. I like to provide an exceptional product as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious as to why you believe your product could knock mine out of the water &quot;any day of the week&quot; (just had to quote that one more time, sorry :)&nbsp; Have you tried mine?&nbsp; Have you ran it on HPLC to check the purity?&nbsp; Did you just judge the book by it&#039;s cover?&nbsp; Curiosity is killing me here.<br /><br />Anyway, I have enjoyed our conversation and you are a very courteous converser!&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope I have been too!&nbsp; <br /><br />Have a great night,<br /><br />RP<br />
