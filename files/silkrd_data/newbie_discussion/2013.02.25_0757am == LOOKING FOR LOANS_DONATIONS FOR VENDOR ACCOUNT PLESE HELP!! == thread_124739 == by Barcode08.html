				Hi SR!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a poor man trying to make a buck. I know ALOT about counterfeit coupons, barcodes, and photoshop. I have been making and using counterfeit coupons for about 18 months now. So I decided to write an ebook on how to make your OWN coupons for whatever it is you want! You will never have to buy anymore counterfeit coupons. You will be able to make them yourself with my step-by-step ebook, for ANYTHING YOU WANT! All software including a free updatable photoshop cs5 is included. I currently dont have the funds for a SR seller account so im asking the nice SR community for help. All loans will be paid back immediately! Loans that are 4 or more BTC will&nbsp; get my eBook for free! I currently need 16 BTC. I will update amount needed as loans come. I hope to become a top notch vendor in the SR community. Hopefully you all provide me with the opportunity. Thanks for your time.<br /><br />Loans/Donations send to my SR name: barcode08<br />Provide your email address for eBook download.<br /><br />-Barcode08
