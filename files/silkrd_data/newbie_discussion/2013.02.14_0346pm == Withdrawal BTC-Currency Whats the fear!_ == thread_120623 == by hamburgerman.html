				The problem is not covering your illegal activity, but proving that the money came from legal business. If you are a school teacher and suddenly come up with a million dollars like you said, you ll have to provide some convincing evidence that you legally got the money. That&#039;s what money laundry is about. Not that I am familiar with it, some big vendors here can be much more specific, although I doubt they will.<br />For the first part, MtGox sucks because it&#039;s a pain in the ass to get verified and they can freeze your money if you use tor, or if the money is too much or whatever they think seems suspicious, which is unacceptable to deal with for a service that I pay.

If they decided to start questioning you about it, they are going to want to go in to every detail.<br /><br />How did you acquire bitcoins? What date? How much did you pay? blah..blah.. Then you could slip up, they&#039;ll know you are lieing and they&#039;ll do everything in their power to prove it. <br /><br />I mean, it&#039;s probably not as big a deal as people say, but its better to be safe than sorry. If I was a vendor I know I would rather nobody knew about me having BTC and such and just launder my money through a business perceived legitimate.

				I believe the whole point of using bitcoin is to keep the governments out of your pocket. Why would you want to open that can of worms? Its the TAX and the scrutiny you&#039;ll be put under. I would think that 98% of bitcoin transactions are illegal drug purchases. I read that bitcoin is supported by SR and the 22 million it did. The govt. don&#039;t like you messing with their money so its better to fly under the radar!
