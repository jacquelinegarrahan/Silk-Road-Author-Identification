			<dd class="postbody">
				So I placed my first order today from what seemed to be a well respected vendor (top 7%).&nbsp; However, in the item posting they had mentioned that any Newbies with less than 10 postings would need to release escrow before anything was shipped.&nbsp; Since I placed a small order, I have no problem doing that, but I have no idea how to release it.&nbsp; The money is sitting in my escrow and the order status says &quot;processing,&quot; but I don&#039;t see how I&#039;m supposed to release anything.&nbsp; I&#039;m really hoping for my order to be shipped asap and want to make sure that I&#039;m not holding up the process by not releasing the escrow..<br /><br />Can anyone out there please advise?&nbsp; Help is greatly appreciated?

				You will have to wait until the vendor has the order from processing to &quot;In Transit&quot;.

				If my order still says &quot;processing&quot; in 4 day&#039;s, does that more than likely mean that the vendor has no intention of selling to me?&nbsp; &nbsp;How long does it usually take for vendors to process orders?&nbsp; It&#039;s only been about 10hrs, so maybe I&#039;m bugging over nothing and the vendor just hasn&#039;t gotten around to it yet.....&nbsp; <br /><br />However, if it turns out that my order doesn&#039;t get processed in the 4 days, can anyone recommend how to find a vendor that will sell to first time buyers?&nbsp;

If they still haven&#039;t by then, you&#039;re entitled to cancel and get a refund.<br /><br />10 hours isn&#039;t very long, give it a day or two before you start freaking out. <br /><br />To find a vendor that doesn&#039;t ask for FE, you&#039;ll have to just search SR and read the vendor&#039;s pages. They all have some info about their FE policy.
