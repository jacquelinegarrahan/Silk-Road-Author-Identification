				Hi All, I placed an order with a domestic seller for 2cb. he asked me to FE which I have declined to do for obvious reasons. I even gave him the name of another vendor who can vouch for me (I am placing my first few orders this week) and said if that wasn&#039;t good enough then he should cancel the order no hard feelings and I can go elsewhere. Now he is not really communicating very well with me. had a good old rant at me yest about people not finalising (nothing to do with me!) then said today I had to FE.<br />advise on what I should do?? obviously my btc are now tied up and I cant do anything for 10 days (Ithink)

				screw them. Unless they made it very obvious before you ordered that it would be FE only then screw them, wait for your bit coins back, order from a reputable seller

				Thats where i made my mistake not checking the profile page properly. Everything I have read on here says not to FE and from what I can gather it is against the rules for them to insist on it. But how can you build up your stats as a serious purchaser if everybody insists on FE and you dont agree with it?&nbsp; ??? <br /><br />I have been ripped off once too often in &quot;the real world&quot; so was hoping for a better trading platform!

				As a newbie with less than 5 and sometimes 10 transactions you will get this a lot. You may have to FE (finalize early) but check the vendors feedback on SR and on this forum.<br />&nbsp;ALWAYS do research before placing an order, read all the terms and conditions on the vendors profile.<br />If you are not happy with their terms then try and look for someone else. Use the SR search box, that is what it is there for. May take more time but it will be worth it. Hope this helps and Good LUck.

				ok the vendor has msged me and said i dont have to FE which is good, but I am now quite skeptical that the goods are going to come at all and if they do are they going to be the quality and quantity they should be (i&#039;m suspicious by nature :-/ ) just going to have to have some faith that they will I guess!

Not sure what makes one new account suspicious and not another, but I have a feeling having address in an area that a known escrow scammer orders from has something to do with it.&nbsp; In any case, until you get some feedback just make smaller purchases, and pay (possibly) slightly higher prices to use vendors who don&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; Also vendors who offer package tracking are probably less likely to ask for FE because in the event of a dispute, they have proof as to whether the package was actually delivered or not.<br /><br />I think the reason we read so much about never agreeing to FE is less about one new user getting ripped off once or twice and more about the community as a whole.&nbsp; If more users (especially new ones) stop agreeing to FE under any circumstances, it makes the prospect of starting a vendor account, sending some real shit to accrue positive feedback and then running off with the mony from 20 buyers who all FE&#039;d in the last 5 or 6 days a lot less profitable. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177966.msg1284674#msg1284674">Quote from: makerbob on June 28, 2013, 06:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ok the vendor has msged me and said i dont have to FE which is good, but I am now quite skeptical that the goods are going to come at all and if they do are they going to be the quality and quantity they should be (i&#039;m suspicious by nature :-/ ) just going to have to have some faith that they will I guess!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep, but that&#039;s the price we pay to use this service.&nbsp; Along with (possibly) higher quality products than are available locally and (also possibly) a higher degree of safety, we run the risk of shit randomly not showing up and vendors purposely scamming buyers.&nbsp; The USPS doesn&#039;t loose packages very often, and if you do your homework and choose your first few vendors wisely you shouldn&#039;t have to worry too much about being scammed.

				As a vendor it&#039;s discouraged to ask for FE. And you require a certain amount of good transactions before they&#039;ll even allow you to request it (otherwise you get banned, and lose the (at current 5BTC) deposit to become a vendor).<br /><br />I really dislike it but I *completely* understand why people would do it. I have about 15-25 transactions in-progress, of which at least 10 I&#039;m 100% certain have arrived but the people just haven&#039;t bothered to finalize.<br /><br />I&#039;m very very particular about sending 1st class same day.<br /><br />It absolutely sucks as a vendor, but I have enough of a backdrop of cash that I don&#039;t need the money *right now* which I guess a lot of the FE vendors don&#039;t - or they see the BTC price going down slightly and don&#039;t want to lose money on their sale.

				Even though I&#039;d prefer to work with people who can handle their cash better (no paycheck to paycheck bullshit, that kindof person is one stupid mistake away from getting ruined), I don&#039;t understand how people could just forget to finalize. Honestly, auto-finalizing should get people kicked from the road if they do it too often, vendors need to actually get paid for their services! I feel ya sk0rt.

				UPDATE--------------seller finally dispatched on monday and I received it today (wed). I must of caught them on an off day as communication improved greatly. The product was spot on weight and looks good. It tested well and I am looking forward to trying it at the weekend.<br /><br />It must be frustrating as a seller when people dont finalise but its no good lumping everyone in the same basket. Sometimes you gotta have faith in people!
