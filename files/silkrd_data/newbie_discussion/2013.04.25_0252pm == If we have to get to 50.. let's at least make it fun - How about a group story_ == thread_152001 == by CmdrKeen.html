				If we have to get to 50, lets at least make it fun. How about a group story?<br /><br />You are a class A fucking asshole too if you do shit like &quot;and he dided. bwwawaahaha&quot; or &quot;and his mother fucked him in the ass with a broom stick until he died&quot;. So piss off. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />It was cold night in January, when John discovered Tor, and Silk Road... &quot;Holy shit!&quot; he thought, &quot;An online marketplace to buy drugs and other illegal shit? No fucking way! It&#039;s gotta be a scam..&quot; He knew about the &quot;dark net&quot;, and bitcoins, having been in the IT industry - in hosting operations for the last 15 years of his career, but he&#039;d never run into anyone who actually knew what they were doing with it, and thought it was mostly comprised of pimply faced little skript kiddies on power trips &quot;Your Windows XP box has been P0wned!&quot; kind of thing....<br /><br />

				Allright fine..<br /><br />After awhile, he tried an heroin order.. and found that he liked H quite a bit. A few months went by, and he was good and hooked. Lost his job, and had to move back in with his bparents..<br /><br />One day, his mother walked in on him IVing, and she bent him over the bed (his mother was a weight lifter, Ms universe) and ass-raped him with a broomstick until he died. All the while, screaming, tears rolling down her face, &quot;My baby will not be an addict! No! Shhh! this is better for you, You&#039;ll enjoy this death.. shhh!&quot;<br /><br />When the coroner showed up, he discovered that John&#039;s ass hole had been reamed to about 8 inches wide, and it was pretty much a straight shot open cavity from his ass, into his brain, with the insides looking like a milkshake.<br /><br />His mother plead insanity, but the courts rejected it after an evaluation. She was found to be fully in control of her faculty and was put on death row. John&#039;s father&nbsp; shot himself one night with a 32 caliber pistol during the trial.<br /><br />While John&#039;s mother was in prison, awaiting her chance to ride the lightning, she met Cindi, a 6 foot tall amazonian bitch who taught her the joys of licking snatch, and having fingers shoved three knuckles deep into her asshole. Cindi&#039;s and hers was a whirlwhind romance, both were strong women, and they would frequently get into knock down, drag out fights in the commons areas over who would be &quot;on top&quot; next time. The guards would usually have to come in and break it up. A few days in solitary away from eachother would usually soften their hearts and as soon as they could, they&#039;d be back together. <br /><br />They were smart too, and during this time, developed a language of knotted strings, much like the ancient Mayans did. Since string was rare, they&#039;d do it with their pubes. And while they were in solitary after a fight, they&#039;d have inmates pass their knotted pubes back and forth, with messages like, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;ll take the top tonight..&quot; and &quot;No, I&#039;m sorry.. I love you..&quot;.<br /><br />A few years passed, and John&#039;s mother finally was called down to death row. For her final meal, she requested steak, with potatoes, and a few slices of sushi. <br /><br />As she was being strapped into the chair, she thought she could see through the mirrored glass to a room that was mostly empty, but there in the back sat the scepter of John, needle marks up his arm, tears running down his face and she thought she could hear him saying, &quot;I&#039;m sorry momma.. I&#039;m sorry..&quot;<br /><br />The water was cold as they placed the wet sponge on her shaved head.. you don&#039;t get that in the movies, how cold the water is as it trickles down your neck.. <br />
