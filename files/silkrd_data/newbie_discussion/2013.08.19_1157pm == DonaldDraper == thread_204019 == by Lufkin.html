				I&#039;ve been buying from SR long enough to know that one of the &quot;unbreakable&quot; rules is NEVER FE. I ordered from DonaldDraper the other day, and FE because I liked his stats, and I like his prices, and once in awhile I like to gamble. <br /><br />I got the product today, packaging and stealth was superb. Product is legitimate. the package got here so quickly that I know he couldn&#039;t have wasted a second between getting my FE and shipping the goods. His communication was outstanding and reassuring, and acknowledged the trust that is required to FE. I still felt a little trepidation, but was willing to take the chance. And my trust in this supplier was well founded.<br /><br />Timing was perfect on my end. While I do enjoy the product recreationally, I also use it for pain relief when I over do it on the farm. Today was such a day, and I&#039;m icing my muscles and letting the meds kick in.<br />DonaldDraper is the real deal, and will be a regular go-to supplier for me. <br /><br />That being said, don&#039;t anybody spam my inbox with offers of cheap bridges for sale if I agree to FE.&nbsp; :)
