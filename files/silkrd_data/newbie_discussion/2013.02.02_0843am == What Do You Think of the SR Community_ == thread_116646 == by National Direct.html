				Well here is where we hear from our new members on their first impression of our community. I think SR is incredible, with a majority of buyers and sellers who respect each other. Despite the low-life scamming, SR has brought a group of people together where responsible discussions and actions can take place to change the very fabric of our centralized, capitalist world. <br /><br />Although I didn&#039;t list it, to me the SR Community is like alcohol: Anyone can access it, it can calm u down, it can fuck you up, it can ruin your day (wtf is my mail?!), we&#039;re friendly, but some of us are assholes. Prohibition didn&#039;t work on alcohol, and won&#039;t for drugs. Most importantly, alcohol can be made in almost every part of the world&#039;s land. All you need is sugar. Like a bar&#039;s social scene is lubricated with booze, the SR community comes together to help each other make the right choices. SR brings opportunity. Psychedelics can humble your soul and open your mind, and narcotics can be a fun vacation from the stresses of life. We should always realize the consequences of our actions on ourselves and those close to us. <br /><br />I hope all you new users can find common ground on opinions, have some meaningful trips, and make some friends along the way. Always be safe and do your research!<br /><br />

				Weed, but then IMO the same is true in the legit world too - you can get burned on eBay (I have), you can get burned in shops, you can get burned by friends and family. Trusting and loving people is your good karma, people breaking that trust is their bad karma, you just gotta be ready for occasionally getting other people&#039;s bad karma smack in the face! Then, roll with the punches, pick yourself up, and find some people deserving of your love and trust again!&nbsp; ;) :D ;D

				Loving it so far. Great range of products and the forum seems friendly enough. <br /><br />The vendors I&#039;ve spoken to have been very helpful, and the advice re: buying practices posted in the forums has been invaluable. <br /><br />Fuckwits everywhere in life though, and here is no exception. Easy to spot and avoid though.<br /><br />So far, good times. Long may it continue!<br />

				It took me a while to get here, as I am not a real a computer guy.....just getting my feet wet.....I am a potential new vender....been growing medical cannibas for quite a few years.<br />looking for new patients who appreciate quality medicine, without all the synthetics, sprays, and harmful products used by many growers.....I grow &quot;clean green&quot; and am certified<br />all products are OMRI.<br /><br />Have used other websites and about 80% of the patients on those site&#039;s are scammers, jackers or rippers........Just looking for honest (real) people who want quality medicine on a consistent basis in a time manner&nbsp; <br /><br />So.....right now I am reading all the threads.....checking out products.....and learning the ropes.<br /><br />thanks

				I have to confess that when I first started here I was amazed at how friendly the community was. Lots of folks jumped in to help me learn the ropes of vending here on SR. The buyers were, and have remained very nice, and what few vendors I&#039;ve met have been really nice as well. Busy and terse sometimes, perhaps, but that&#039;s to be expected.<br /><br />And yeah, there are the assholes. Ever been in a community where there wasn&#039;t at least ONE sour apple? Me neither. They&#039;re around; they&#039;ve successfully scammed me a few times. But they&#039;re the exception, not the rule. <br /><br />SR remains a testament to what a real free market looks like, and how well it can function when left alone by corporatists and government bureaucrats who want to regulate everything to death and beyond. (As an aside: I wonder how many vendors there are here on SR who pulled themselves up out of the Great Recession&#039;s poverty because it was the only thing they could afford to do?)

Overall, I&#039;m pretty happy with the community. At least as of right now, there are way more careful, seemingly intelligent and polite people on here than idiots, assholes, and such. I&#039;m pretty happy with it, but you always gotta watch you&#039;re back man.

				Thanks for all the honest replies. Weed (the selection heading for the most rational view of SR for the new user). I&#039;m happy to hear that most of you feel positive about SR as a whole. Just imagine if we didn&#039;t have it. It&#039;s changed my life and those around me who use drugs for the better. Although I am now a vendor, I had a forum account with quite a few posts but I haven&#039;t remembered the recovery details for a while now.<br /><br />Over the past year I&#039;ve spent $10K+ on SR with ~80 transactions (probably about 25-30 different vendors) and I haven&#039;t been scammed once. I FE for my regular suppliers and I have in many other cases (I don&#039;t encourage this behaviour, I was just lucky to have correct judgement when I did FE).<br /><br />I think everyone will eventually see SR as a revolutionary concept that has truly made a permanent mark in this crazy world.<br /><br /><br />Have Fun and Be Safe!&nbsp; ;D
