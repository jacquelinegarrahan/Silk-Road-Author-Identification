				Since I can&#039;t post anything in his review thread..<br /><br />I ordered around 5 weeks ago and was quite worried as I had expected it within a couple weeks max. That&#039;s mostly my own paranoia that got the best of me. <br /><br />Product: Looks incredible. Biggest rock I&#039;ve seen with a bunch of smaller ones and some crystals. <br /><br />Packaging: Looks good. Not the best but good enough.<br /><br />Overall? If the product is as good as it looks.. I&#039;ll definitely be a repeat customer. <br /><br />5/5

				I&#039;ve ordered 2 times from OldAmsterdam.<br /><br />The first time the package arrived 4 days later.<br />I&#039;ve got some crystals, the quality was satisfying.<br /><br />The second package arrived 12 days after it was marked as sent.<br />In this time OA already offered me a reship, but it finally arrived.<br />The quality improved in comparison with the first package.<br />I&#039;ve got 3 incredible fat rocks of clean MDMA.<br /><br />I can&#039;t complain about the packaging.<br /><br />5/5

				I can&#039;t stress on new buyers to OldAmsterdamit! He selectively scams people. And even if you don&#039;t FE you are no longer protected by Silk Road with vendors who - even though OA screws people, turns a pretty profit for the Silk Road crew who once had entegrity but not any more. Even if you give extensions and are told by this bastard that he will refund your coins - doesn&#039;t mean he will - he didn&#039;t and it also doesn&#039;t mean he will be forced by Silk Road to pay you back! <br /><br />Silk Road used to be a good place - I don&#039;t know what happened, ..... greed I&#039;m guessing. Long time friends here - going on 1 year! - told me that that &#039;Pirate&#039; was really a PIRATE and I told them, &quot;Nah!&quot; Not Robert! Sorry folks - from what we&#039;ve learned from Silk Road Vendor support - that is no true!<br /><br />Unless you&#039;re willing to at the very least - tie up your coins - probably loose them! - and expect ZERO help from Silk Road Support in the Resolution center - they sold that area to big vendors!

				OldAmsterdam is no scammer.... He was simply having restocking issues a couple months back. I recently ordered 10g MDMA to the US and recieved my package in about 8 days<br />with no problems whatsoever, and he has excellent communication. I had to FE since Im new to SR and he couldve EASILY just ran with my money yet he didnt, and my <br />product was actually almost a gram over what i paid for, not to mention he has excellent product.....&nbsp; 2 thumbs up for OA!!

				I agree I don&#039;t think OA is a scammer...<br />I ordered from him once and it never arrived ( I live in a high risk countrie for customs) but he accepted to resend half of it just based on trust and I was a new buyer on the road at this this time, and I finally got the reship. The packaging was maybe not the best ever but good enough&nbsp; and vacuumed very well and as flat as possible and the MDMA is really very good .<br />He always had a good communication so far <br />Cheers OA

				Seems like there are too many reports of selective scamming. Maybe better to stay with smaller vendors for starting out. I did place a 100g order of M1 from Googleyed for my 1st order....so I&#039;ll see how that turns out

				For anyone who thinks he is a scammer just open a dispute in the resolution center.&nbsp; My first order came but the second did not.&nbsp; I got a 100% refund from SR after I gave him two 10 day extensions.&nbsp; If you demand a refund right away SR may side with the vendor.<br /><br />What I think happens is he marks orders send when they are not.&nbsp; He is likely dealing with 100&#039;s of orders a day and just accepts a bunch at a time.&nbsp; Drug dealers are not the most organized people, probably just gets high and misses a few here and there.

				Pretty decent seller ..Ive dealt with Dutchandbod and OA with large orders and so far Dutch&#039;s shipping is faster and more discreet than OA. However OA has a better product and huge chunks. Just be patient when ordering from OA. Good guy
