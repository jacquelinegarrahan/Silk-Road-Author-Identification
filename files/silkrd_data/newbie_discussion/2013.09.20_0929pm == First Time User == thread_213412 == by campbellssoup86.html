				So, I am about to pull the trigger and order some bud from SR. I have set up an account, got myself some bitcoins, but am EXTREMELY paranoid (who isn&#039;t these days?) about actually ordering. I&#039;m hoping someone can walk me through this a little and help calm my nerves before my product arrives.<br /><br />When I got my bitcoins, I was forced to use my actual name and information. The transaction went fine and I received my bitcoins and easily transferred them to my silkroad account, however, I&#039;m a little paranoid that my actual name and information is connected to these bitcoins. Perhaps I don&#039;t quite understand that bitcoin process or maybe I&#039;m just super paranoid but should I make a few SR accounts and transfer the bitcoins between them before purchasing?<br /><br />I need to order this bud because my mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer and neither one of us have the means to locate bud the traditional way. I&#039;d hate to go to jail for trying to comfort my mom but we&#039;re both trying to be as discrete as possible. What are you best safety tips for shipping? <br /><br />Sorry for being such a noob, but I have to ask. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!<br />

				You seem way too paranoid;<br />Your bitcoins can&#039;t/won&#039;t be linked to your Silk Road account. Sending bitcoins to your SR account is legal and completely fine, as long as you make sure the actual use of SR is kept to tor and no information is given you should have no problem.<br /><br />As for your worries about mailing, there&#039;s no need to worry. Unless you are ordering QP&#039;s of weed or thousands of pills at a time, there is an absolutely miniscule chance that you will even be bothered by anyone. If you are unlucky enough to get your package siezed, you may or may not receive a seizure notice in the post. This does NOT mean that you need to worry, as if you do get one they send you a notice and leave it at that.<br />Good luck, it&#039;s an amazing feeling getting drugs in the post :)<br />-DmT

				Thank you for your advice. Something about ordering drugs to the suburbs just screams &quot;arrest me&quot; but the more I read, the more I learn this isn&#039;t the case.

				Moving bitcoins to SR is not illegal, there are legitimate products on here too.&nbsp; I would never get to cocky, but really LE is not to concerned about end users anymore, and with the road being difficult to track I would say you are generally safe as far as LE goes.&nbsp; Just use some precautions such as using only an encrypted USB based OS so as not to leave a trail on your actual computer (I suppose not mandatory, but should at least put your browser etc. on it), it would be extremely difficult for them to prove you actually ordered the stuff if they were to try and follow up (hey I was swatted), they are obviously more interested in vendors, of which can not be back tracked through you so you are of no value to them anyway. I would imagine they would just confiscate a package if they were to discover the contents (probably for their own personal consumption).&nbsp; Also with USPS mail a federal warrant is required and as fast as mail moves, would make it difficult.&nbsp; So you are fine buying bitcoins the way you did and moving them to SR.&nbsp; Now just make sure you read reviews very carefully before ordering and do not FE (finalize early), I have ran across many cool vendors here that do not require it, so try and stick with them.&nbsp; For shipping you are fine using your real name and your home address, (again, you didn&#039;t know what was in the package).&nbsp; Good luck, and don&#039;t sweat it

				Thanks for the advice! <br /><br />I&#039;ve also read that I should write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on the package and leave it alone for a few days prior to using it. Any truth to this advice?<br /><br />Also, I had it sent to an apartment. Is this any more or less risky than sending it to a house? (not that it matters now, the order has already been placed...)

				Remember, you can create dozens of bitcoin accounts and send them to yourself. There are also bitcoin &quot;washers&quot; out there that you can send to, and they send back to you. But honestly, I think you are being too paranoid as well.<br /><br />But that&#039;s right, and if it reduces the stress in your life, go for it.

				Apartment, house, it doesn&#039;t matter, the package will look like the thousands of others the mail man delivered that day.&nbsp; I suppose if I ordered a QP or something I may consider waiting to open (probably still would not make a difference in court), but for a little weed, or little whatever I do not think LE will wait outside a few hours then raid your place hoping you opened the mail.&nbsp; You just would not get the package at all if they were on to it.

				Aside from giving up your name when buying the bitcoins, there is really nothing you have done wrong. And I think for a small purchase of weed then you should be fine. The great Dread Pirate Roberts has made Silkroad one of the most secure places on the internet. Despite it being the target of just about every government agency, it persists today :D
