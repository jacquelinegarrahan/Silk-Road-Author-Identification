				http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2013/07/undercover-police-informant-busted-planting-drugs-in-legal-smoke-shop-by-in-store-surveillance-cameras-2721422.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The owner of a smoke shop in New York busted an undercover police informant planting crack in his store thanks to multiple in-store surveillance cameras.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is hardly an isolated incident. The New York City Police Department, for example, has fabricated numerous drug charges, according to a former narcotics detective, and one officer was even thrown in a psych ward for revealing systemic corruption in the department.<br /><br />The practice can also be seen outside of New York.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Columbia, South Carolina, a police captain stated in a sworn affidavit that he was approached by then-Deputy Police Chief Ruben Santiago about planting cocaine and a stolen gun in a city official’s car.<br /><br />Also earlier this month, in England, a detective admitted that he was involved in a deal to plant a shotgun and drugs in someone’s car.<br /><br />Clearly, this is a problem across jurisdictions.<br /><br />In this particular case, Donald Andrews, Jr. was targeted by Scotia and Schenectady County police who believed that he was involved in illegal activities of one kind or another.<br /><br />The police sent an undercover informant to his store, which sells legal smoking paraphernalia which local station WNYT notes “might also be re-purposed for other illicit activities,” twice in March.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Basically if you are not aware of how cops conduct themselves in this country then you could be in a lot of trouble because it&#039;s like this:<br /><br />If the police want to get you on something -they will invent it. This guy owned a headshop; it was perfectly legal but some cop didn&#039;t like it -so he got his paid informant to go plant evidence.<br /><br />Lucky for this guy he had the informant on video.&nbsp; He probably (and smartly) had the video uploaded to a remote website because oftentimes during a search warrant -cops will destroy evidence like this.<br /><br />The cops want to make it into a story about a police informant gone wrong -but quite frankly; these guys don&#039;t shit without a policeman telling them to sit down. <br /><br />

				Not only should this not be news to anyone, people browsing this site are more than likely to actually be carrying drugs on them. Let&#039;s be honest, there is no need for the police to plant anything on us if we are stopped and searched.<br /><br />But I like this thread, because people should be aware of how the police operate. People like to spout about how your car cannot be searched without probable cause, but the police do whatever they please. If you are stopped for no reason in the middle of the night, you should expect to be treated like a criminal and the police will do anything they can to search your vehicle. Refusal to search you say? Let&#039;s call in the canine unit and have them scratch your car (whether or not the dog actually smells anything). That gives the police probable cause without you doing anything other than driving around in the middle of the night. <br /><br />I just wanted to raise a little awareness. Sometimes the police won&#039;t give a shit if you have a dime bag of weed in your car. Other times that is exactly what they are looking for. Just know that if you are traveling with drugs in your vehicle keep them well hidden!

				&nbsp; &nbsp;This sort of misconduct by the police is nothing new, although interesting and informative to the public, in terms of law and justice it&#039;s always been there and will continue to happen. However fear not, although these sort of accusations can make your life hell for a certain amount of time, most of the time these allegations/charges go out the window as a lot more then just the planted evidence is needed to get a conviction. If circumstances are such where one way or another you can be related to any of the planted items, only a lawyer who knows his shit can help you, for example, your a mid size pot dealer, and LE plants kilo of crack, a jury would find it more believe you were weed slinger then crack dealer. Anyway, guys if you cant be good, be careful!<br /><br />Meerkovo
