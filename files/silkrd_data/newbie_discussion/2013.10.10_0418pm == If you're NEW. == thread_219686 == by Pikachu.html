				Look, I&#039;m new so I wont completely bash everyone else that&#039;s new here too, But listen. . . <br />There&#039;s isn&#039;t a fucking &quot;New Silk Road&quot; even if the .onion takes you to the log-in screen, it doesn&#039;t mean shit. It doesn&#039;t function without JAVA, which is a big no-no from my earlier reading of the Forums before actually joining. IMO Deep Bay is sketchy as fuck because some rando person keeps trying to promote it. I&#039;ve been there. It&#039;s ghetto and has no structure. Sheep&#039;s interface look refreshing and modern, but I don&#039;t know too much about it. BMR is what everyone seems to be using, so if you&#039;re looking to make purchases go there, BUT DO YOUR RESEARCH! My first buy was from a reputable vendor but my package never came giving me a bad taste in my mouth from SR, but hope was restored by AIDONEOUS my personal favorite for mdma. I only found him because I read about him on the forums and looked up his ratings. Also, PGP is a must. I&#039;m learning as we speak and will always use it. Don&#039;t know what it is? search it. There&#039;s a thread on the BMR/SR forums that explains it. I&#039;d also recommend keeping tor and other sensitive items on a thumb drive.
