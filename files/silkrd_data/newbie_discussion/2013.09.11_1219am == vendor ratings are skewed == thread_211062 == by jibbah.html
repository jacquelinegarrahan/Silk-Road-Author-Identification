				i really dont get the vendor rating section. lots (most? all?) require your to either give them a 5/5 or go fuck yourself. meaning anything less than 5/5&nbsp; will get you banned from ordering from them ever again. this seems to make the vendor feedback essentially useless as vendors who have feedback tend to only have 5/5 feedback. god forbid someone give something less than that. <br /><br />i understand that vendors want high feedback. and they are correct in saying that if the customer is going to leave less than 5/5 then they should contact the vendor first in order to give them a chance to make it right and make it a 5/5 transaction. but really? as i see it, vendors are holding a customer&#039;s future business hostage and saying &quot;unless you leave the best, you can forget ordering again.&quot;<br /><br />seems that a better indicator would be how many customers actually leave feedback. i&#039;m not sure if a customer can determine that from the stats that are supplied? customers that are very happy will almost always leave feedback. customers&nbsp; that aren&#039;t happy wont bother leaving feedback. customers that are very unhappy will leave feedback that is less than 5/5.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				But, if your vendor delivered a less than 5* performance, why would you want to buy from them again?<br /><br />As far as I&#039;m aware, there&#039;s nothing that&#039;s offered by only one vendor.<br /><br />If you need to leave &lt;5 feedback, as long as your reasons are genuine, and you&#039;ve spoken to the vendor first, then that&#039;s the feedback you should leave. Then find a new vendor (you will).<br /><br />Especially good reason to find a new vendor if they say that unless you leave 5 feedback then they won&#039;t do business with you again. In my opinion, if a vendor says that to me, they&#039;re getting very poor feedback, and no return custom as a direct consequence of that demand.

				I haven&#039;t had a bad vendor experience yet.<br /><br />Maybe I don&#039;t understand the rating system then? This is how I interpret the ratings:<br /><br />1,2/5 - don&#039;t bother. shit show, don&#039;t waste your time. the only thing that could be said for them is that they didn&#039;t scam you.<br /><br />&nbsp;3/5 - adequate and would use them in the future assuming my usual go-tos are unavailable. <br /><br />&nbsp;4/5 - would use this vendor on a regular basis. maybe the only reason I don&#039;t use them regularly is pricing or they don&#039;t regularly carry products I want.<br /><br />&nbsp;5/5 - great all around. go-to vendor.<br /><br />5/5, to me, denotes best possible everything. product can&#039;t be better. shipping couldn&#039;t be faster, communication is great - responsive, helpful, friendly. stealth might as well be some sort of cloaking device. This vendor makes your feel like your the only customer in the world - thats how well they take care of you. 5/5 would essentially be reserved for 1 or 2 of your vendors your go to.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe I&#039;m looking at this wrong. But when I see a vendor have some super high rating near 100%, it makes me think they&#039;ve manipulated their feedback by a rating hostage situation. <br /><br />Having said that, 1 vendor I use in particular does really deserve the near 100% rating :)

				If something goes wrong and the vendor fixes it then its a 5/5 if they dont then it less.. <br />If no one FE then they wouldnt ask its the pussy ass buyers fault <br />Try and not only look at the /5 rating but the feedback too alot of times I see 5/5 vendor doesnt answer msg product was bunk etc they leave a 5/5 and acurate feedback so maybe read
