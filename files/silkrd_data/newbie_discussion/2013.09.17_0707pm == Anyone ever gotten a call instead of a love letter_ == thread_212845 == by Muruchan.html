				A little over a year or so ago I decided to give SR a shot, a few packages came without a hitch, and then a dipshit vendor sent me an eighth of loose weed in a sketchy, hand written box. <br /><br />But here&#039;s what&#039;s weird. I never got a &quot;love letter&quot; like everyone here talks about. I got a call from John the &quot;Postal Investigator,&quot; informing me he had my package, could smell the weed in it, and asked if I wanted him to put it back in the mail. I said I wasn&#039;t expecting anything besides a few books and someone must have been fucking with me or done something without my knowledge. All was good and he said my package will be searched and if it contains what he thinks, destroyed. <br /><br />Skip ahead about a month later, I order 5 blotters. seized, got a call from John again. This time he seemed really fed up and I used the same &quot;someone is trying to get me into trouble,&quot; but instead of asking to put the package in the mail again or to destroy he told me that this was my second strike and if it happens again he would turn it over to the local authorities, didn&#039;t say what would come of the package. Fearing my address is flagged and his claims true, I&#039;ve kept clean ever since.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the things though, I still have 18 btc that i purchased back in the day for about $15 each, and I&#039;d really like to spend some of my unexpected small fortune. Would it be safe to make a few small (spread apart, personal use) orders from reputable vendors? Do you really think I&#039;m on my &quot;second strike&quot; or it was just scaremongering because they didn&#039;t want to spend money on further investigation for such small amounts of contraband?&nbsp; <br /><br />But most importantly, has anyone else had a similar experience? I&#039;ve been lurking the board for about five hours now and can&#039;t find a damn thing about something even remotely similar happening..&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; I&#039;d REALLY appreciate any type of insight.

Your average drug dog cannot smell that so it would be reasonable to assume they are just opening your mail and seeing the trippy blotter. You&#039;ve dodged a bullet twice, don&#039;t try for three times. Find a friend.

I was also ordering legal RC&#039;s from an open web vendor that shipped from the Netherlands, so there was a semi-steady flow of packages coming from the same suspicious country. I would only be ordering domestic from here on out. <br /><br />I simply don&#039;t have it in me to put the risk on a friend, all of which have a lot more to lose than me. I could use the btc to get a fake I.D, but wouldn&#039;t I be worse off if that got caught than a gram or two of hash/molly?<br /><br />I&#039;ll just order a few packs of smokes first and see what happens.

				I dunno if your ordering from USA or UK but if i were you (I live in the UK) i would bet Â£100 they now have that address on some computer database of addresses.<br /><br />Get another address, move on. It&#039;s money down the drain and possible v$n time if you order anything Class A.
