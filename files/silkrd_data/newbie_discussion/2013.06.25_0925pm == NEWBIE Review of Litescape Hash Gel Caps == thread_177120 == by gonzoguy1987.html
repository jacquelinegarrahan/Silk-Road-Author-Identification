				Very satisfied with Litescape, definitely a legitimate, reliable vendor on the SR.&nbsp; I place my first transaction on the SR on Friday night and the sample 3 gel caps were sent out Saturday and no kidding they fucking arrived on Monday; I don&#039;t know how Litescape is that fast but hell yeah.&nbsp; I now feel more comfortable about putting in a more expensive order in the future here on the SR.&nbsp; Just do your research and test vendors with small orders and check their feedback, but shit I was always getting bullshitted on the street by douchebags that think they can keep shitting on the little guy cause he aint gonna do anything so SR is no more risky and at least I get to see reviews from others on a vendor.&nbsp; I doubt a vendor could remain a good rep here by ripping people off.&nbsp; About the product, the quality was great too; I was a little disappointed at first because I was expecting to be stoned after an hour, but I did not feel anything and I took it on an empty stomach, but I then went ahead and had a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee and was watching Baron Vaughn on The Half Hour on Comedy Central and it had been about two hours since I took the 3 gel caps and I was like holy shit, I am actually stoned.&nbsp; It was not really anything special, but it was legit.&nbsp; I think I need to get some medical grade Sativa/Indica hybrid, but it was still&nbsp; pleasant and the shipping was fast;&nbsp; you can&#039;t beat a speedy delivery right to your door and a legit product.&nbsp; The seller also seems to be professional and responsive.&nbsp;
