				Anyone know of any good sites that talk about free energy technology?<br /><br />This is the most important issues facing humanity today. Until we switch from coal/oil to free energy technology, clean energy technology, the human race cannot advance or evolve.<br /><br />This really is the number one priority for those of us who want to help the human race make advancement.<br /><br />So if you know of any good sites about free energy technology, please post them here. Thanks

				Not specifically related to your question, but the documentary Zeitgeist: Addendum focuses extensively on creating a sustainable future using technology, as well as extracting exorbitant amounts of energy from geothermal sources: http://www.zeitgeistaddendum.com/

				Hey man if you might want to check out John Hutchinson,Dr Judy Wood and theres Nikola Tesla who you may have already heard of. Its might not be what your looking for but its very interesting, There are many video on youtube, you can let me know if its of interest.<br /><br />Dr Judy Wood <br />John Hutchinson ( The Hutchinson Effect )<br />Nikola Tesla <br /><br /><br />Some info i found, Full link here ----&nbsp; http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070516124051AAQkrvQ<br /><br />According to Hutchison, while trying to duplicate experiments done by Nikola Tesla, he discovered a number of strange phenomena, including:<br /><br />levitation of heavy objects.<br />fusion of dissimilar materials such as metal and wood, while lacking any displacement.<br />the anomalous heating of metals without burning adjacent material.<br />the spontaneous fracturing of metals.<br />changes in the crystalline structure and physical properties of metals.<br />disappearance of metal samples.<br />All these phenomena are jointly grouped under the name Hutchison Effect (HE). Supporters like Mark Solis, his former webmaster, maintain that none can be the result of known physical phenomena, such as electromagnetism.<br /><br />Hutchison and his supporters surmise that these phenomena arise from zero-point energy or the Casimir effect. Hutchison also says that he invented a form of batteries, which he &quot;calls Q Cells&quot; or &quot;Hiroshima cells&quot;, which he describes as obtaining energy from the quantum vacuum using the Casimir effect. These batteries have been labeled by some as over-unity devices, however according to the claims made Hutchison&#039;s this would be incorrect.<br /><br /><br />Interesting eh<br /><br />

				The dirty truth of it all is, nothing will change until we NEED it to. You can argue otherwise, but take anything that&#039;s ever been done before that&#039;s considered revolutionary, and you&#039;ll see it didn&#039;t happen because it was government mandated. Anytime something is government mandated, government sponsored, government funded, it becomes a giant, overspent boondoggle. In other words, we&#039;ll get cheaper energy when we run out of the other stuff first.
