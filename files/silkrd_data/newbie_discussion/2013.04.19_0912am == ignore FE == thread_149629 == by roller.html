				I don&#039;t know! Tell us what happens! I&#039;ve heard about more and more people havin opinions about how the escrow system should be honoured. Yet some vendors do tend to expect FE.

				Don&#039;t FE! Find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require it because you can easily get scammed that way... If he cancels your order you get your money back.. If it&#039;s hedged you get the dollar value minus 4%, but it&#039;s better to lose 4% than to lose 100% by getting scammed...

				Can you cancel the order?&nbsp; He should cancel it if you don&#039;t.&nbsp; I suggest purchasing things from vendors that don&#039;t require FE to build up your buyer stats for vendors that require that.

				Never, ever EVER, ever FE under any circumstances from unfamiliar vendors, when starting out. Even with top-ranked sellers. Never do it.<br /><br />If it is a top-ranked seller with great specks but says &quot;requires FE for anyone with &lt;X amount of transactions&quot;, there will always be the option of MESSAGING them on SR to explain you are new and would like to buy small orders from them (presuming you are starting with small orders, like a smart person), and majority of the time they will understand you are just starting out, and you had the courtesy to message them explaining yourself, and will help you out with building up your transaction stats. But if they just blankly state &quot;requires FE, no exceptions&quot;, close the bar and move on.<br /><br />When I first started on SR, I fucked up and ordered from Enter the Matrix, he ran off with $200 of my money, apparently he went rogue the day after I purchased and raked up about 15-20k worth of buyer&#039;s money who FE&#039;d, believing he was trustworthy, but he requested FE for any order from anyone. Fucking maggot. <br /><br />When you are seasoned with a good amount of transactions and you know which vendors you can trust, by all means FE. They will appreciate it and will generally reward you (but dont expect free shit, earn your free shit). But only trusted vendors that you frequent.

				You will be able to cancel the order yourself if it is still processing after 4 days.

				i hate FE too, but as long as you buy from people with very good reputations, you&#039;ll usually be OK. and these sorts of people usually only ask that you FE the first time you buy from them anyway.
