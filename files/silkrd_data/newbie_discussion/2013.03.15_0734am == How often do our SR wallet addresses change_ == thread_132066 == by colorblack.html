				So I&#039;m curious. My SR wallet had a different address last week. I know this because Bitfloor gives an overview of transaction history (which is actually annoying now that I think about it.. ) but in any case, I noticed how last week my wallet had a different address then it does now. Do these change automatically randomly? Or a certain schedule? Or what? I know theres an option to GET a new addresss.. but I&#039;m curious how mine changed without me specifically changing it..<br /><br />Donate some insight to a newbie?

				I believe you have to manually generate a new address -- I don&#039;t think it changes them without you initiating that change.

				Are you absolutely certain you haven&#039;t been phished?<br /><br />Have you ever been asked for your PIN at the login screen?<br /><br />Have you ever attempted to login from a non-legit URL?&nbsp; (the correct one should be silkroadvb5piz3r.onion

				Scout - absolutely positive. Have the SR page bookmarked in my Tor browser.. and have never had to enter my pin (other then 3 times.. for each of my 3 transactions so far). The only thing I&#039;m thinking of, is, at some point while on my account page if I accidentally clicked on the &quot;Get New Address&quot; link? Although that&#039;s also very, very unlikely. <br />You think I should change my password just for peace of mind?

				Did you lose any coins?&nbsp; I mean, I really don&#039;t think it was any kind of compromise of your account based on what you&#039;ve said .... sounds more like an accident or some confusion.&nbsp; If you&#039;re concerned, definitely change your password.

				Just changed my password for added peace of mind. But no.. didn&#039;t lose any coins. But then again, I don&#039;t keep them for a long period on my SR account either. I just transfer in, conduct my transaction, and usually have about a few dollars left. And those have remained untouched. Yeah.. must have been accidental I guess.&nbsp; :-\

				Well, sounds like you&#039;ve done what you need to for peace of mind -- also, none of your bitcoins were missing, so that&#039;s good.&nbsp;

				They change as much as you tell them to. There is a button for it under account settings believe. Or somewhere in that general area. Just explore the interface and you&#039;ll find it

				Not that often, anyway try to stay sharp and take a look before deposit/withdrawal, either SR or wallet. As other said, u can always change by yourself on your account
