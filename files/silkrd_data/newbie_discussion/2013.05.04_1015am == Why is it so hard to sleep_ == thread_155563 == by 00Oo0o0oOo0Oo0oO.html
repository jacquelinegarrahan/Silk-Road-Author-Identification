				Here&#039;s my advice: give up on sleep. It&#039;s impossible to make yourself sleep if you&#039;re not tired, so you might as well just stay up and chill. Play some videogames, browse the internet, write some poetry, whatever.

				If you&#039;re trying to sleep after being up all day, one thing that works well for me is melatonin.&nbsp; It&#039;s a hormone already naturally in your brain. It&#039;s the brain&#039;s &quot;time to go to sleep&quot; signal, it regulates your circadian rhythm. <br /><br />You can buy it at just about any health store, drug store, or grocery store in the health supplement section. It&#039;s pretty safe to take, as in not a toxic chemical (the ld50 is ridiculously high, 3250 mg/kg in rats, which is up there with table salt).<br /><br />I take it to help me flip my schedule back and forth between awake all night at work and awake during the day on my non working days when I&#039;m home with my family

				Yeah it sucks when you cant sleep.<br />Few things that people try are...<br />1. Doing exercise during the day. Helps tire you out<br />2. Have a bedtime routine. I.e. at a specific time each night wind down, get into bed, read a book or magazine.<br />3. Don&#039;t take your stress with you to bed. Meditate if necessary to clear you mind.<br />4. Nightcap a shot of alcohol.<br />Good luck with it.

				I think it&#039;s psychological. The more you try to sleep the harder it is, then when you try to stay awake, you just fall asleep. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Got nothing to add that hasn&#039;t been said before (healthy lifestyle, healthy mindset, etc.), though for future drug reference: If you find yourself partaking in things that&#039;ll keep you up (acid, amphetamines, etc), may I recommend GHB as a fantastic parachute down to lala-land. But yeah, enjoy your first package, this is a fantastic place.

				Most probably because your some kind of addict, of some substance, that you dont currently have in your blood. Thus keeping your mind and body from resting?<br /><br />Usually why i cant sleep, either weed, or opiates..some times just stress of bills, but if i have enough pot that goes away for a few hours.

				personally i would recommend ambien (stilnox in UK) to get to sleep. Anxiety related insomnia is pretty common and i have such. Either drug related or life related the anxiety stops me sleeping. <br />For future reference if you work, you would want to get sedative and hypnotics with a short half life so you dont wake up with a &quot;haze&quot;.<br />Anyways all of the above helps but if it&#039;s too bad i would say dont go through it. Either get up and do something or pop some sleep aids if you need you sleep for something.<br />Cannabis is definitely not the answer because habituation is so easy and is detrimental to your overall ability to sleep. Do not use any sleep aid for more than 2 consecutive weeks and avoid using unless you really need to.<br />Peace <br />Astron
