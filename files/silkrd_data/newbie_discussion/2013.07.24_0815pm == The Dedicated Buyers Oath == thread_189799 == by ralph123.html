				Hello people so there&#039;s a couple of issues that are always being talked about. One is FE and the other is PGP. So who is ready to take an oath and stick to it? Will someone be willing to write out a proper oath and stick to it? Maybe it would go something like this:<br /><br />As an honorable member of Silk Road it is my prime directive to show respect and faith in the Silk Road team as well as for mine and everyone&#039;s protection by always using the escrow system and never finalizing early. It is also my number one goal to always use PGP when sending any sensitive data no matter what and I will always have more respect and faith for those vendors who require PGP because they have real concerns for my protection. I will never use a vendor who does not give me the option to use pgp. I intend to only use vendors who use pgp no matter if another vendor who doesn&#039;t use pgp has what I want. <br /><br />Let me say that again: &quot;The vendors who use pgp have a real concern and respect for the buyers protection&quot; It is not hard to use pgp and if you can&#039;t take the time to learn it then you should not be buying or vending here. Everyone needs to put aside their squabbles at one another and band together on this important issue<br /><br />Another issue I have is tracking numbers. I find it to be a fine line on the reasons why a vendor can&#039;t give somebody their track number if that&#039;s what they paid for. I do see the problem in that when somebody gets their track number then they act stupid by checking their DCN several times a day. I think that when FE is required then it should be negotiable with the DCN like I&#039;ll place the order then you give me the DCN 2 days later then I&#039;ll FE and release those funds to you. It&#039;s a little shady if I have to give you my money up front so you can go buy my stuff from the guy down the road. I&#039;m looking for highly professional vendors who wants to do business with an honest trust worthy individual who has immaculate stats. <br /><br />I can see the issues with vending to a brand new buyer with no stats because after all i agree that they need to prove to everyone that they are not out to scam just like with new vendors who end up sending out free samples.<br /><br />all comments and perspectives are invited so please let&#039;s talk about it.<br />

				DCNs get abused by buyers more often than not. If a vendor has a policy which states when to expect a shipment, a DCN should not be required by a buyer until after that time has elapsed.<br /><br />However, some buyers use certain kinds of drops where know when the order will arrive is beneficial to them. <br /><br />So it&#039;s should be a case by case evaluation as to when a buyer is entitled a DCN. I wouldn&#039;t say that a buyer is paying for a DCN as it is that the buyer is paying for a certain shipping time frame.&nbsp;
