				Hey guys. I was looking at the buyers guide and some stuff im just not sure about. I know your suppost to have it sent to a different address but what if im not able too? Then its saying when you put your name and address when ordering do you use pgp or does it already do something when it gets sent to them? do i have to use pgp to give address when ordering? last but not least is it ok to have one order sent to regular address, if so should i use real name or how should i do it? please PM me with answers or here. thanks . i want peoples real experience not what they think. im trying to do this as safe as possible. thanks

				I can help. Definitely don&#039;t have it shipped to your address addressed to someone who actually liives and receives mail there, or to a friend or relative&#039;s house addressed to them. Be sure they are cool or at least not nosey so they don&#039;t open it. The misinformation about vacant house drops or fake names are huge red flags to the Postal Service. Nothing wrong with someone receiving mail to their house, although I would research heavily using the forums and vendor feedback to make sure they pack adequately. Just don&#039;t order to often or you mailman might get suspicious. You receive average mail everyday and all of a sudden you are receiving multiple small packages and Priority mail. Might trigger a nosey mailperson.<br /><br />Fake names are the worst. What if the parcel was too big to fit in you mailbox or slot. The Postal delivery person might leave a slip for you to come to the post office to pick it up. Not a reason to panic, but they may ask you for ID. See where I&#039;m going with this?<br /><br />I am a vendor, but currently am out completely, not for long hopefully. If you would like to let me know what you are looking for I can make some recommendations on good vendors for what you are looking for.<br /><br />If you have any more questions, just ask or shoot me a PM under &quot;My Messages&quot; on the forum page.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Benzy

				sounds like you are trying to rush things. to be honest with you, i researched for like two weeks before i ever made an order so i wouldnt have to ask questions like that. though &quot;no question is stupid&quot;, i always like to know for myself. i read several posts and make my own judgement. to answer your questions though...<br />i would def use pgp. i have ordered before without using it but its better safe than sorry.<br />i also always have it shipped to my own home with a real name. the post man knows who lives at each address as he delivers mail every day. a false name might draw attention. <br />when you get your package, you should wait to open it. i do anyways. a couple hours to make sure that your package wasnt intercepted and they are waiting for you to open it. mark your package return to sender and keep it with your mail for a few hours before you open it.<br /><br />besides the point, i would put tor and all your sr related info on a flash drive and encrypt it with truecrypt just to be safe. also tails isnt a bad idea to run when you are silkroading. just put it on a disk or fd and restart computer and run tails. hope this helps.<br /><br />oh yeah, sometimes i order little cheap stuff from ebay that way sr mail isnt the only mail coming from random addresses.
