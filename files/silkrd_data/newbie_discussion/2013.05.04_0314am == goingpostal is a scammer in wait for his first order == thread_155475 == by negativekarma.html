				I think they are the same person, or goingpostal is a guy who works for mimm.<br /><br />I say this because of a recent order I recieved from mimm. Not sure if I can go into more details until I hear back from mimm.

I hope it&#039;s all a mistake of some sort, otherwise I&#039;m out money and have to somehow find another vendor who&#039;ll ship international without scamming me :(

				Sorry, I should have prefaced that by mentioning that it was just my opinion that they&#039;re either the same person or somehow working together anyway.

If he was going to up shop and start scamming, why would he send me shitty drugs when he could send me nothing at all.<br /><br />Plus I dont see his meth listings anymore, I&#039;m hoping other people complained too.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m not touching goinpostal or mimm again till I get some answers

				While on average 30% of our orders are shipped to Oz the few that don&#039;t get them wanna cry and bitch and say we targeted them .. U make me laugh if u think that your 0.5 ggram is what i was really after the whole time! .. With hUndreds of thousands in Escrow thats what I was really worried about. We are business men and damn good at it! love us or hate us we deliver More than u will ever know. Cheers!

				I have ordered from MiMM a few times now and have had no problems! I have tried the Armani Exchange and Calvin Klein E pills and the hi heat coke and the quality has been top notch! Best blow I&#039;ve had in years, in fact! My last order came with a GoingPostal sticker as well so I have no question that they are one and the same and am going to continue ordering with confidence. They seem to be one of the better vendors on SR that&#039;s for sure, (Sam G. anyone? yeah, me too, unfortunately). If you live in Canada I would definately order from MiMM/GoingPostal. Keep up the good work guys! Love ya!!!
