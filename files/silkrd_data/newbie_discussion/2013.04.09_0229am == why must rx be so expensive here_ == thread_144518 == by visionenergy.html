				Prices are about half on the streets where I&#039;m from.&nbsp; Sucks.&nbsp; Good prices on somethings though.

				People on the street are usually desperate for cash, you run the risk of a bust, no reviews, etc. Pills may be stolen and unreliably sourced, or even more desperate people paid pennies on the dollar.<br /><br />You pay for premium service &amp; discretion I guess.

				everything&#039;s more expensive on the Road.&nbsp; But rx are also more expensive then other drugs in general.&nbsp; Probably because a lot of the time they are expensive to get through the pharmacy in the first place.

				I guess the way I look at it is I pay a premium for not having to hit up a dealer, arrange times to meet, where to meet, do the meet, etc. etc. Groceries delivered are more expensive than at the grocery store.

				they are expensive, but its mostly bc they can! i mean, people will pay that, especially when its for an addictive drug, such as oxy. shitttttt, they&#039;d prob seel a body part for a fix if it was that bad.

				Yeah I was so mad when I saw the Adderall prices.<br />Then again, SR isn&#039;t for discount drugs. It&#039;s so you know what you&#039;re getting instead of from sketchy street dealers. Not the site to buy Rx&#039;s imo.

				i used to be able to find REAL OC80s for sometimes 20 a pop. now people laugh when i ask for .50ct/mg try $1/mg and in the mid/south ive seen people pay $1.5/mg for oxy... shit is crazy. heroin is better imo.

				ya, I have heard that down south is where the prices are really high.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard people selling norc 10&#039;s for 8, 9 and even 10 dollars a piece.&nbsp; 4 dollars a piece is average where I&#039;m from.&nbsp; But I guess if there is some redneck rebel from the south willing to pay 10 bucks for one, you really can&#039;t blame the vendors for gladly putting the money in their pockets.
