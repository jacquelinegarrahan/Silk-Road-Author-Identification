				I&#039;m looking into portable vaporizers and am curious what folks are finding is the best for weed (regular, plant matter, that is) and also what&#039;s best for hash?<br /><br />For weed, I&#039;m seeing the Ploom Pax mentioned a lot. It&#039;s expensive, but... perhaps worth it?<br /><br />For hash, I&#039;m not sure what everyone has, but at concerts I see people with pen-type vaporizers that have some kind of glass globe on it. What&#039;s that?

				I can personally vouch for the magic flight; this little piece of genius comes from the days before vape-pens.<br />&nbsp;I was walking around, holding this thing in my hand (w/o the glass straw, in a manner so no one can see what I&#039;m holding, think a cop using his little radio mic, it just looks like I&#039;m covering my mouth when I take a hit) and taking small ghost hits in public while no one was the wiser.<br />&nbsp;Can you say movie theater? because a big smelly tub of popcorn (vape smell? nope) and a relatively empty movie theater (plus some ghosting) and NO ONE SEES ME GET HIGH BUT OPTIMUS PRIME. Seriously. <br />Not to mention its a pretty simple/durable little design.<br />As for hashish, I couldn&#039;t personally say, but for hash oil I recommend the Micro G pen. They come in packs of 2 so get a friend and start vaping.

				I love using my magic flight in public. For oil you could just put a drop on some ground weed too.

				Thanks for the advice on the magic flight.<br /><br />One question I&#039;m having as I continue t research: is a vaporizer right for me? The reason I ask is because when I smoke out of a pipe, I rarely want more than a hit or two per &quot;session.&quot; I find most weed these days pretty strong, and it affects me with just one hit. Am I going to be burning through more than. Need with a vaporizer?

				Thanks for the replies. I guess I&#039;m still trying to decide if a vape is right. I like the idea of not inhaling smoke, but is it possible to do only one hit per session from a vape and not burn/waste weed?

				I can also personally vouch for the MFLB. I got mine off of amazon for about $80 and its treated me fantastically. Great vapor quatlity/amount when you learn to hit it, especially for the price! My friend has a volcano, and I would strongly suggest you invest in one of those, especially if you get lifted often.

				www.fuckcombustion.com<br /><br />ploom is a pain in the ass as it requires constant cleaning to work properly.&nbsp; plus, the chamber is large (.3g) and requires filling for it to work properly which wouldn&#039;t be suitable for what you&#039;re asking.<br /><br />i think if money is not a limiter, go with the thermovape cera LL.&nbsp; it has a small bowl that you don&#039;t have to fill, and if done right, you can add hash as well.<br /><br />you can also try their older model, the thermovape t1 which you should be able to find for about ~$140.&nbsp; that has a small bowl too.<br /><br />the t1 and cera, however, will combust when not used properly but that&#039;s because it&#039;s nearly pure convection.<br /><br />never tried solo but people love it but bowl size might be too big for what you&#039;re asking.

				Don&#039;t get a Plume vape.&nbsp; They are cheap pieces of shit that suck to clean.

				What is the proper method for hash? It&#039;s my only domestic purchasing option right now, apparently there will be more weed towards winder (makes little sense to me)
