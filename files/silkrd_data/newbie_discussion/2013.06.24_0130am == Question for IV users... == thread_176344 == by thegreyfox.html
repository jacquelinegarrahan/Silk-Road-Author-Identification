				Hey y&#039;all,<br /><br />This is for the bangers out there... How many staph infections have you had from shooting. I&#039;ve been getting one almost monthly since I got triple stuck with the same needle by a frustrated nurse in the psych ward. It was also when I started Remeron. I recently read Remeron can cause increased risk of infection. So, how often have y&#039;all had staph?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				Thing is, staph is largely found in hospitals and jails.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using a needle on and off for about 6 months now, maybe a little more, and though it isn&#039;t my favorite route, and I&#039;m not hooked to anything, I can tell you it&#039;s not really the needle but the conditions.&nbsp; Most hospitals give way too many unnecessary shots anyway.<br /><br />When I first started out, if my buddies who banged Dilaudids didn&#039;t do it for me, I&#039;d screw up (sometimes really badly and, out of frustration, screw up more).&nbsp; So many misses, so many unclean environments...&nbsp; It&#039;s a wonder a lived through the first month!<br /><br />But the worst that happened were abscesses, scarring, and bruising.&nbsp; Never any infections or poisoning.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s more common in H users (I doubt it, but I&#039;ve mostly only shot MDxx and MXE) but the needle itself can be fairly safe.&nbsp; Not the safest method, but not as horrific as people make it out to be.<br /><br />This is NOT an endorsement for trying the needle.&nbsp; But if you ever find yourself there, don&#039;t panic, be safe, and use a clean rig every time.<br /><br />Also, this is just one member of ST talking here.&nbsp; The others don&#039;t like needles and would probably never touch them.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a bit of a freak in my own rights lol<br /><br />Be safe, and&nbsp; keep clean ^.^<br /><br />~ST

				plan on getting off the Ritty and back on Dextroamphetamine (not Addy, ugh) once i get my &quot;Fireball&quot; shot in... i will taper off the IV OxyM to just plugging it. i&#039;m also going to stop the Remeron. i just added Anafril (a TCA) to my meds, so i can stop the Remeron and see what happens. the sporadic nature of the infections and the lack of other IV users experiencing them make me feel there is something else at play...<br /><br />need a bell-ringer of Coke ASAP though... really, anyone have a vendor who sells smaller amounts (like i want 3 ringers at least, but am not rich)?<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

I got a 1/4g.... The only other &quot;ringer&quot; I&#039;ve ever achieved was off a tiny $20 rock of Crack (baking soda reacted off with vinegar to make pure Coke for shooting)...<br /><br />I did the shot and felt like I had been plunged under water. I decided my headphones would be better music... I unplugged the speakers, then groped in vein silence for the headphone jack (regret that sooooo much). I almost yelled to my roomies that they needed to come up and make sure I didn&#039;t die. I explained a &quot;ringer&quot;: to my friend yesterday as.... &quot;You get as close to an OD as possible without OD&#039;ing....&quot; Haha.<br /><br />I will weigh what I got out (check to see if it&#039;s over), then dissolve it in water (1/10mL per 100mg). If it dissolves completely, I will use 50 milligrams along with 5mg OxyMorphone and 10mg Methylphenidate to try out the actual strength. Then, if I think I can, I will split the remainder (hopefully each shot being a &quot;ringer&quot;) between a &quot;Fireball&quot; (75mg of &quot;subsrgood&quot; #4 Heroin, 15mg OxyM, 30mg Methylphenidate, and 100mg of &quot;kirbynose&quot; Cocaine) and a plain Speedball (H&amp;C, boy&amp;girl, going old school!). Or, if I am worried about the ability of 100mg to produce a ringer, I will bump the &quot;Fireball&quot; Cocaine dose to 150mg or 200mg (and either weaken or eliminate the Speedball). I will measure everything with my milligram scale... That way IV users now what to expect from &quot;kirbynose&quot; Cocaine. A good &quot;ringer&quot; is hard to find. If you have shitty Coke, it doesn&#039;t matter how much you do, you won&#039;t achieve it. I&#039;m hoping to get this shot on my first try.... And to keep the Cocaine all together (you want a tiny amount of water when IV&#039;ing Cocaine... 100mg in 0.2mL of water is much different rush than 100mg in 1mL of water). If I can figure out a way to shot up using two different needles at once, I&#039;ll shoot the Cocaine and H using 0.4mL of water and the Rx stuff in 1mL to combat this.<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

You have to use an acid (I use vinegar) to react off the baking soda. I prefer street Crack over street Coke as the process of creating Crack doesn&#039;t allow for cut to be carried over. So, once the baking soda is reacted off, you have pure Cocaine. But, if the &#039;cook&#039; uses a 1:4 Cocaine to BS ratio, then it doesn&#039;t matter... the shot will suck. The last time I got Crack, it was crumbly and still bubbling (baking soda reacting) when I had it in the rig. I didn&#039;t get high. But, off a&nbsp; &quot;size-12 font O&quot; piece of Crack that was hard as a rock I got from the Bluff in ATL, I got my only bell-ringer in my career of shooting/doing drugs. My dumb ass wasted it because I decided music would be better from headphones, unplugged my speakers, and couldn&#039;t find the headphone jack in the dark. It hasn&#039;t &quot;snowed&quot; around here in forever... So, I&#039;ve come to the SR. I read that if you have shitty Coke, you can&#039;t get a ringer.... the cut fucks it up for you.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				Yes, I used Vit C to react with the crack and dissolve it, but it still gave me an abscess! <br />As I said, the body cannot seem to break it down, every one I know that has used crack (with Vit C or Citric acid) always had either a lump that took months to disappear or they got an abscess too.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
