				Some of the conspiracy dudes are right and this is all about bitcoin manipulation. Say its some dudes fucking with it to make money? How low do you predict BTC would have to go in order for these guys to buy back in to BTC open up SR and allow it to rise again.<br /><br />BTC has certainly dropped since this started so I&#039;m thinking like $80 if somehow this were the motive

				I seriously think that BTC is headed for a big fall before it recovers and takes out its all-time highs in the 260&#039;s. What will actually cause that to happen? I doubt it&#039;ll be SR, or anything on Tor for that matter. It&#039;ll probably be the obvious: Mt. Gox.<br /><br />Why the fuck is it that a cryptocurrency with a completely distributed architecture has over 80% of its trades conducted on one exchange in Japan?!? That single point of failure is gonna be a nightmare for Bitcoin until other exchanges, preferably in offshore jurisdictions, pick up a lot of that slack.

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the DDoS is coordinated by any one of the global anti-drug government organizations. <br /><br />Also, possibly some sort of extortion attempt. I know that was talked about before.
