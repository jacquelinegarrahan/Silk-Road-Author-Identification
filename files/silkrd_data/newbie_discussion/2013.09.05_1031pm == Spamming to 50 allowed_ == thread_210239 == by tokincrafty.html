				I&#039;ve been seeing a crapload of these and I was wonder if it&#039;s even allowed. Most forums I&#039;ve been to that require a post limit strictly prohibit

				It is not kindly seen by full members to just avoid getting to know mechanisms ruling this community and instead of this just writing 50 meaningless posts, become jr. member and still doesn&#039;t know anything. It is better when you write in normal topics, question things, learn something. The number 50 is to encourage you for doing that. Nothing will happen when you write something funny and meaningless from time to time, just don&#039;t avoid education and coeducation with others, don&#039;t make spam the most of your posts.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I guessed. I figured that the members who finally break the 50 post limit legitimately will have a higher understanding of silk road &quot;ways&quot; and so on

				I think the 50 post requirement for newbies is also meant to weed out ACTUAL spammers from those who actually want to use the forums. So ironically, putting in the effort to spam 50 posts probably shows you&#039;re determined to become an actual contributor. <br /><br />However, you may, like me, prefer to take a more relaxed approach to gaining full membership. smoke a J and join in the community in your spare time, it pays off in the amount of extra information and knowledge of SR you get in return for trawling through. Look up newbie review threads for your sellers and find out about their reputation and policies through feedback, I know I could have avoided some anxiety over slow post by researching my sellers here and making a more informed choice. <br /><br />Plus I get to practice my writing :P

				The spam in the newbie board has been tolerated since the 50 post rule came into being even though spam is not accepted on the main forums. Given most people have come to accept the change to the post rule now there is going to be a gradual cleaning up of the newbie board to reduce the number of spam threads. Those who spammed their way out of the newbie board need not worry about seeing their post count suddenly drop as none of the old spam threads will be deleted, just locked and allowed to slip to the bottom out of site. New spam threads however will be deleted.
