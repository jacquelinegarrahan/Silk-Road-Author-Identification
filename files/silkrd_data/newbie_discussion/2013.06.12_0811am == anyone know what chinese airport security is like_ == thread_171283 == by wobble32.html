				I haven&#039;t been for a while but the security is about the same as everywhere. I wouldn&#039;t tempt fate though, when they execute someone they send the bill for teh bullet to the family. So they are serious fuckers!

That says it all... <br /><br /><br />Honestly every time I think of Asian Ariports, I think of the movie &quot;Brokendown Palace&quot; starring Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale.

				duno if that bullet comment is exaggerating but brrrr i getting shivers.<br /><br />yeah that movie is intense. thats also a great dead song. Ok so what is my best option? I feel like ordering that even if it is LEGAL is going to result in some sort of flag.. that is if customs doesn&#039;t stop it.<br />

				I would imagine China somewhere up the chain would have something to gain from say... a large purchase of PMK....<br /><br />But, the United States would most CERTAINLY give THAT box MAJOR scrutiny... lol &quot;What? You gook dissed our GMO Corn! Dag nabit! WELL STOP THERR MAIL!&quot;<br /><br />I donno. I imagine China just being one of those countries that the regular joe mail man does NOT see too many packs from either...

				I heard that underground chemists prefer MD-P2P ;D <br /><br />What do you mean too many packs from either?<br /><br />Also, major scrutiny of packages was my reasoning for wanting to go to china in person. Maybe I&#039;ve been lucky but I&#039;ve only gotten smiles from TSA agents NEVER a hassle over years of flying. I&#039;ve even come into us from s. American countries, from what i could tell they were more concerned with foreigners (they were doing retinal pictures to anyone not a us citizen)<br /><br />&nbsp;I believe a lot is about attitude and confidence in those situations. Jedi Mind tricks. Also useful for getting into concerts for free.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I&#039;m with the band&quot;
