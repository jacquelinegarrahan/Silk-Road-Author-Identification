				I had a vendor mark my package as &quot;shipped&quot; USPS Priority last Wednesday evening, 26 hours after I placed my order.&nbsp; <br />It is now 10 days later and still nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />She said by SR law vendors have 17 days to reach me, <br />even though her info page says packages can be expected to be delivered in US within 6-8 business days.&nbsp; <br /><br />My question is: is this normal practice?&nbsp; <br />I have only been on here 2 years and made about 15 orders, but I have NEVER dealt with such.<br /><br />Can someone maybe elaborate?&nbsp; <br />Is this person just milking the time they have before repercussions come about?<br /><br />Baffled, because I ordered Tuesday, <br />marked as shipped Wednesday USPS priority meaning it should have been here no later than Saturday--LAST WEEK.&nbsp; <br /><br />Six days later now and still waiting.&nbsp; WTF?<br />Not frustrated as much as concerned.<br /><br />Regards friends-<br />dapperdude<br />I appreciate any and all input.<br /><br />Regards-<br />dd

				Maybe it has been intercepted.<br />I had a package arrive one day before resolution center from Netherlands and I am in UK!<br />He marked it in transit but I knew it wasn&#039;t. I think he was probably waiting for supplies<br /><br />Was worth the wait as it was some of the best coke I have had here<br />

				Definitely not intercepted, not by USPS priority.&nbsp; no smell, super stealth.&nbsp; that&#039;s the last of my worries.&nbsp; I just believe that the vendor thinks that they have 17 days to get it to me and haven&#039;t shipped quite yet, as was seemed to be the circumstance in this email to my question about how priority mail should have arrived already:<br /><br />&nbsp; Tax season is prolonging everything my dear . I am trying to make everyone happy but at the same time<br />&nbsp; we have also been closed down for maintenance as well.. Vendors have 17 days to reach you . In U.S that<br />&nbsp; is usually more than enough time. Just not lately.. my apologies . But this part is out of my hands. Read up<br />&nbsp; on Vendors and buyers handbook so you do have some worries eased. Many of vendors are all dealing<br />&nbsp; with issues lately.. But doing best we can. <br /><br />Made me think it hasn&#039;t been shipped.&nbsp; Your thoughts?<br />
