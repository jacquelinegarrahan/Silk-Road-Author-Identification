				1st time- Bought oxys from Caligirl, FE&#039;d for brand new buyer and had a 100% satisfying transaction. Was nervous for the time in transit to the time it reached me but everything was fine...<br /><br />2nd time- FE&#039;d again but did not receive anything. Terrible experience. After I left 1/5 feedback, vendor looked up my name and address on google and tried blackmailing me. He said if I didn&#039;t return my feedback to 5/5, his &quot;defense team&quot; would have to take care of me. I don&#039;t know what information he had but I wasn&#039;t going to fuck with it on the basis that he knew more about me than I knew about him, right? After that, I changed my feedback and he apologized for getting fucking crazy basically and offered me a 100% refund... Days went by and I would check periodically. Nothing... Then one day a few hundred dollars popped into my account and so I would say although not at all an ideal transaction, ended up not losing anything.<br /><br />3rd time- PLANET EXPRESS..... Need I say more!?<br /><br />And the last time was just fucking awesome. No FE and the best part is when you get your package and you have to SEARCH for your product because you don&#039;t think it&#039;s in there. That is great fucking stealth.<br /><br />The best advice I could give you is look for reputable vendors. Like so many have said before and it doesn&#039;t apply just on here, if it seems too good to be true, it probably was. This was the case with planet express. 14 dollar 30mg oxys? Should&#039;ve known... Always check HERE first!!!! Search the vendors name in the search box or check out the rumor mill. Sometimes the vendor will even put up their own review thread on the forum for added feedback

				I was very nervous when I bought my first thing from there as well. I think its a normal feeling. I&#039;ve bought quite a few things there now and all transactions have been 100% fine. Sometimes shipping took a while because the vendor took a while to ship out but other than that no problems. I&#039;ve also never bought from a vendor that requests FE. Even my first transaction, the vendor didn&#039;t require it. I also go through and read a lot of the feedback. That is what makes my best decision. Even if there is something I want and that is the only vendor with it at that time and the reviews are iffy. Nope. Won&#039;t do it. And even with how secure it is, there is still an amount of risk involved that you just have to accept if this is something you are willing to do. But to answer your question. Yes, I am pretty comfortable with purchasing from there. But then again I&#039;m also not buying in bulk or anything of the sort. Strictly for personal use. I would feel much more uncomfortable buying large quantities in fear of for one, losing a large amount of money and two, getting a controlled delivery.

				As long as you use TOR safely, use PGP to encrypt any sensitive info, and browse the forums to research a vendor before you use them than you should be fine. I&#039;ve had a shit ton(scientific term) of orders go through and I&#039;ve never ONCE had a problem. Well, never once had a problem that me and a vendor couldn&#039;t work out ourselves. It may seem a little scary at first to order things through the mail, but as long as the vendor knows how to package the product right no one will ever know there are drugs in there. Be safe, and enjoy your drugs in the mail ;D

				As the most people here, my first transaction made me also nervous but just after waiting two days I was suprised by a well-stealthed letter in my letterbox. After this succesful transaction I was sure, I have found my new favourite drug (and of course some other great products) dealer: Silk Road!<br /><br />I began to read so much in this forum and analyzes every vendor, whom I was interested to buy from. This is an VERY important point if you want to get the REAL GREAT stuff on the road, cause it&#039;s just a small quantity of vendors that are selling there products as described (esp. with my favourite drug Cocaine). After reading so many hours, I was sure to know which vendors are really trustworthy. <br />I know mistakes can happen but I also know these trustworthy vendors aren&#039;t amateurs and don&#039;t wanna fuck you up, because that&#039;s not the way to go through this business.<br /><br />I guess there is a great handful of vendors, who will fuck you up by sending a lower quality as promoted on their item-site but you can avoid a bad experience if you carefully inform yourself. Every of (up to now) 25 transactions arrived - no matter which country&nbsp; it was sent from&nbsp; (also &quot;flagged&quot; countries as USA, Netherlands and so on).<br /><br />The 3 most important things if you want to be sure your order arrives to you (there ALWAYS can be an exception) are:<br />1. Inform yourself extremely careful about the vendors (and of course their products!) you are going to buy from.<br />2. Don&#039;t search for the lowest price, because great quality (and trust me, thats what you want if you&#039;re consument) will always be an indicator for high prices.<br />3. Be polite! Every single time you contact a vendor (for whatever reason) be as polite as you can! Mistakes (maybe even caused by you?!) can happen and it&#039;s not necessary to get into an argument because of misunderstanding. You wanna do a deal and not start a fight..<br /><br />Well: First post a bit longer than expected but I guess it&#039;s useful.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />P.S.: I hope my english grammar isn&#039;t too bad. Maybe a small feedback? :)

				It is wayyyyyy safer than the streets. Legally speaking and in general terms. Here in the U.S., you need a federal warrant to open any mail..even if they were to find out what I had...All I gotta say is...I have no clue what you&#039;re talking about. Anyone can send you mail. It took me 2 full days to place my first order after hearing about SR on the clearnet. I have not once been disappointed by a vendor. I do not have to act as if I am a friend with a dealer around where I live(when they&#039;re not). I don&#039;t have to drive by a cop or a police station or, a traffic light camera. And the deals for the products you can get on here. People are always tossing you shit that&#039;s heavy or that come with samples of other products they are coming out with. <br /><br />In short..just an amazing thing to be a part of.

				Depends on what your definition of comfortable is.<br /><br />If you mean comfort as in wanting to have a chilled out weekend and deciding to order some high quality bud on Thursday, without moving nothing more can a couple of fingers (literally)? Pretty comfortable.<br />If you mean comfort as in waking up on a saturday morning in my PJ&#039;s, only to find an envelope with some top grade weed to smoke right away? Still, pretty comfortable.<br />If you mean comfort as in being pretty much 100% certain (if you&#039;ve done your research right) that the drug that is contained in the package will be top grade and safe? Damn right comfortable! :P<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve just placed my first order and am waiting in (not too) nervous anticipation. I have spent a month reading in the forums and researching vendors and am feeling pretty comfortable about the whole thing. I am visualizing myself receiving the package and altering my consciousness and being very happy. It&#039;s just like being a kid again at Xmas! I love the internet! No, seriously, as long as you&#039;ve taken your time to do your research, you should be ok.

				No skimming through the lame dealers to find the good ones. Not having to leave my home to get drugs that I desire which is how it should be, hell you can order everything else online if it weren&#039;t for laws this would have existed a long time ago anyways sooo. I&#039;d say I&#039;m pretty comfortable.

				I feel safe in assuming that if most of us weren&#039;t comfortable with this arrangement, we wouldn&#039;t have anything to do with it. I certainly wouldn&#039;t do it if I felt the risk was nearly as high as buying irl. Despite the slight risk and the slightly higher prices, I could not be happier.

				I&#039;ve been here about a month, I&#039;ve ordered 6 times (4 international, 2 domestic). All got here really fast, except for 1 shipment which took a couple of weeks longer than it should (but when I got it I was compensated with an extra bonus). This place is great, but I have made a rule about only ordering certain things domestic and using international only for drugs I feel are safe to send in the mail. A couple of times I FE&#039;d, though it worked out I won&#039;t do it again. I was a bit nervous though. It&#039;s a relief to have all my stash safely hidden, and no more letters in the mail for a while.<br /><br />Only problem now is getting the time to consume these drugs and deciding which order to take them in, plus I&#039;m a bit distracted at work because while I&#039;m working I&#039;m always planning future purchases, thinking about different trying different combos etc. But these are luxury problems, ha ha.

				I&#039;m pretty comfortable, a few rules of thumb that I always go by:<br />1. Always look for sellers with great reputations. Not only just a good rating, but sellers who have many transactions and good feedback regarding their customer service and communication. You want sellers who will put you and your safety first.<br />2. Make your first orders domestic. Without customs, the chances that your product does not arrive to you are next to none. Also keep international orders to a minimum, the DEA won&#039;t come bust your door down for a few pills, they will just shake there finger and say &quot;tsk-tsk&quot;. <br />3. Do not put yourself in a place where you have to FE, and look for sellers who offer refunds.<br />4. A certain seller might offer a given product cheaper than another, but the extra money may well be worth it to buy from a better seller. <br />5. Don&#039;t accuse the seller of doing something wrong, it will piss them off.

				I agree to these posts,...but,,, the FE thing,if its with a half decent seller,and they request it due to your stats,then you have to really.<br />If their feedback is good,it shouldnt be a problem.<br /><br />If the vendor,has good feedback,etc,then the FE thing,shouldnt be a problem really.,for the buyer, ive only bought from here about 5 times,and out of that 4 ive had to FE early,.i did my home work first,and really didnt have a problem in doing so.<br />(saying that,im still waiting on an order!!)<br />If i was a vendor,i could imagine someone with 0 or very few buying stats,doing a rip off,depending on the size of the order as well thinking about it,.....only being devils advocate here,i know i wouldnt rip anyone off,its a two way thing,(the trust).<br />Would you send out a load of drugs to someone who had just joined,without paying first?<br />Ive seen a few that say they will only sell the smallest amount to a first timer,which is fair.<br /><br />I must admit,i think this SR is really a good way of getting half decent drugs,and such variety too.<br />Good job im skint otherwise id be right ole fuck up!!!<br />

				Moved nearly $1000 through SR now. Buying small amounts doesn&#039;t phase me at all these days.

Every of (up to now) 25 transactions arrived - no matter which country&nbsp; it was sent from&nbsp; (also &quot;flagged&quot; countries as USA, Netherlands and so on).<br /><br />The 3 most important things if you want to be sure your order arrives to you (there ALWAYS can be an exception) are:<br />1. Inform yourself extremely careful about the vendors (and of course their products!) you are going to buy from.<br />2. Don&#039;t search for the lowest price, because great quality (and trust me, thats what you want if you&#039;re consument) will always be an indicator for high prices.<br />3. Be polite! Every single time you contact a vendor (for whatever reason) be as polite as you can! Mistakes (maybe even caused by you?!) can happen and it&#039;s not necessary to get into an argument because of misunderstanding. You wanna do a deal and not start a fight..<br /><br />Well: First post a bit longer than expected but I guess it&#039;s useful.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />P.S.: I hope my english grammar isn&#039;t too bad. Maybe a small feedback? :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You&#039;re English is good! I&#039;m just worried of being caught by postal service. I live in the US and they don&#039;t fuck around when it comes to drugs. I&#039;m not worried about being polite enough and I think I&#039;ll be able to find reputable vedors. I just don&#039;t want the mail or other people to bust me.

It took me 2 full days to place my first order after hearing about SR on the clearnet. I have not once been disappointed by a vendor. I do not have to act as if I am a friend with a dealer around where I live(when they&#039;re not). I don&#039;t have to drive by a cop or a police station or, a traffic light camera.

I&#039;m not really sure about that because it seems no matter how you pay you pay and P.O. Box is going to be tied to your home address anyway. Why not just get it delivered to your home address. Also, I&#039;m only talking small stuff. Some opiate pills, maybe a little coke or mdma. All personal use.

It&#039;s such an amazing feeling. It&#039;s almost as good as the product. Having said all this...whatever you are going to buy from whatever vendor...read, read, READ! I have always had flawless transactions..never sign for anything! It takes a hell of a lot of work for the government to open your mail. As stated before...even if they do, play dumb..say you did not order anything, then keep your mouth shut. They can&#039;t ask you anymore than that, unless you willing allow them too. Know your rights as a citizen of whatever country you&#039;re in..buy from seasoned vendors and don&#039;t go crazy with ordering. Best advice I can offer. Best of luck and stay safe. =)

There are noob guides that suggest sending it to someone else&#039;s address, but nowhere that would raise suspicious like an abandoned building. <br />Beware of Controlled Delivery. Basically if a (mailman) asks you to sign for something that you aren&#039;t expecting to have to sign for, don&#039;t. It&#039;s the feds or the DEA pretending to be Mr. Mailman. They&#039;ve already opened your package and know the contents and have resealed it. They now want you to claim its yours by signing for it. Let them leave it at your doorstep. <br /><br /><br />Besides that, I also have yet to make a purchase. Does anyone know how I can get bitcoins with prepaid debit cards? Thanks in advance. :-)
