				So without much thought about getting caught i bought myself some bitcoins, and bought 5g of mdma.<br /><br />I bought these bitcoins via bank transfer with an online bitcoin exchange, and used my real email address. I think the only thing I did manage to do properly was the pgp encryption thing..<br /><br />After making the purchase Ive spent a lot of time on here reading about, and realized i have been rather careless and am now a little worried! :(<br /><br />If it matters, I live in the UK and purchased from the UK.<br /><br />Am I right to be worried?! And is there anything I should/can do?&nbsp; :-\

				Im fairly new but from what Ive been learning, you want to stay as anonymous as possible (obviously).&nbsp; So, you shouldn&#039;t be using your bank account to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; Although bitcoins are legal, using them sends up a red flag or could be used against you later.&nbsp; Its doubtful your local law enforcement has the resources to hunt you down over 5g, but you never know. USPS money orders seems to be the best choice because you can make up a name and address (although the address has to be real) and they are much cheaper than money grams.<br /><br />When purchasing, make sure you will not have to sign for the package, because the only way you can get in trouble with Johnny Law is if you sign for and accept the package.&nbsp; So, if you order and you&#039;re sure you wont have to sign for it and there&#039;s a mailman trying to get you to sign, refuse the package and eat the money.&nbsp; Otherwise, you should be good.<br /><br />Im sure there are some veterans who might say Im wrong on some of this but this is what Ive picked up so far. Enjoy you&#039;re package.

				get a tormail email account or some anonymous email site like mailinator.com<br />when u buy bitcoins have them sent to a &quot;bit coin wallet&quot; or have them cleaned on a site like bitcoinfog before sending them to your SR address. (optional, but if you are paranoid, than this process is recommended)<br /><br />Learn PGP( its really easy after you figure it out.) Your home address is the most important thing that you need to protect(again, learn PGP).<br /><br />If you place an order from a vendor outside of the UK and it gets nicked by customs, they will probably just send you a letter letting you know it was siezed. It happens to the Aussies all the time.<br /><br />WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS!!! They are fuckin everywhere.. Always search a vendor name in the search bar on the forums before buying. Stats mean shit, they are all padded....You are gonna have less options than us Yanks...but if you research all the excellent info that is in the forums than you can see the bullshit from a mile away (or kilometer or whatever you measure distances with).<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna go do another line so...if you have more questions, feel free to ask, and congrats on popping your SR cherry mate!!!<br /><br /><br />

				Best to err a bit more on the side of caution in the future.&nbsp; But don&#039;t worry... chances are everything with your transaction will go fine.&nbsp; Nobody is likely to be watching you, and nothing you did would stand out as overly unusual.&nbsp; So, no need to be paranoid ;) - don&#039;t read tooo much into the overly paranoid opinions on here.

				I use my bank account to purchase bitcoins from a trading site. I also actually trade... I buy and sell shares all the time. I am still new and have made 3 successful transactions so far. Nobody beating down my door yet. I wouldnt worry about it too much. Im pretty sure I read that SR launders the coins before they are actually deposited on the site.

				you can buy bitcoins anonymously from a local source through localbitcoins.com, then open a bitcoin fog account and transfer them there, then from there pay to SR, guaranteed safety<br /><br />never never buy bitcoins from your bank account...

				IMO there&#039;s too much fear about this. Bitcoins are perfectly legitimate. It is safe to buy them openly. It will raise no &quot;red flags.&quot; The only thing you have to be careful about is WHERE YOU SEND THEM. Don&#039;t send them directly to Silk Road. Move them around first.<br /><br />I am MUCH more worried about buying Bitcoins on Silk Road with e.g. MoneyPaks.
