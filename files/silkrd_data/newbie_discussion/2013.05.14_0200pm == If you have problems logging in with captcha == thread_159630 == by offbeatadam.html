				TOR updated today, and some changes were made to the protocol with the update. This will very easily cause issues for logging into SR.<br /><br />I highly suggest redownloading and installing the newer version of TOR.<br /><br />You can check/download it from the little onion that is next to your URL bar. In addition, you can know something is &quot;wrong&quot; or that TOR is trying to tell you something, by this icon. It&#039;ll flash with a little yellow caution sign.

				<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if it has anything to do with it or not, but I didn&#039;t have the problem logging in with captcha until after I updated tor browser. I was actually on the site looking over orders I made and boom! Kicked out to the login screen with the three digit captcha. At any rate, it seems fine now.

I believe this is actually the autologout... but just misbehaving in a small way. The people that have been unable to login specifically, are those that didn&#039;t have a session beforehand like myself. I had a lot of issues logging in this morning until I fixed TOR.

				I&#039;m not sure if you simply aren&#039;t distinguishing between Tor and the Tor Browser Bundle or what, but the latest Tor version available for download that I see is 2.3.25 (latest stable one, anyway).&nbsp; That&#039;s the same as it was a week or two ago.<br /><br />As for the Tor Browser (which is really Firefox ESR setup in a specific way), that did update.&nbsp; To be frank, I find it awfully unlikely that the basic HTTP &quot;protocol&quot; would have changed in a minor release of the browser -- 17.0.5 went to 17.0.6 -- but it&#039;s not like I&#039;m a Tor developer or something.&nbsp; Still... that&#039;s mighty fucking odd, mate.&nbsp; Are you sure that&#039;s actually the problem...?

However, the TOR browser bundle does include a firefox addon that handles, amongst other things, communication between the firefox and the TOR/Vidalia client. You&#039;re right, that ultimately I can&#039;t say whether or not its actually the problem - but I can attest to firefox addons becoming enemies of themselves when they aren&#039;t the most recent version. When I was on the old version, I was having all kinds of cookie session errors, not just with the captcha on the login page. The only resolution to that, was updating the tor browser bundle, and more specifically the tor firefox addon that ships with it. <br /><br />I will admit, that the changelogs for the bundle aren&#039;t exactly detailed (or all that existant), and I can&#039;t speak to whether or not this truly fixed the issue. However, to the very least, after 30+ refreshes this morning I never got a good captcha - updating the bundle fixed that, when replacing the old version with the same version did not. So, I based it entirely on this discovery, and the fact that the bundle did in fact have a new version. I was also eating breakfast and not really thinking too much about the content of the message, only that... updating fixed the problem that more than one person had.

				I don&#039;t think that&#039;s it either, really because I upgraded my tor browser bundle software this morning.&nbsp; I was already logged in with the latest version and got kicked out. Going forward from there, I was having the same problem as everybody else. My credentials did not work and the screen displayed a three-digit captcha. I could not log in and my software was current. But then I tried ten minutes later and everything was fine, so whatever it was, I don&#039;t think it had anything to do with the tor bundle update. <br /><br />Still, I think it&#039;s important&nbsp; to upgrade your tor bundle or tails version whenever there&#039;s a new release.&nbsp;

				The three character captcha issue arose as a result of site hardening changes; it is nothing to worry about - simply keep refreshing you get a full length captcha.<br /><br />Libertas
