				Hello all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing SR for a while, and I just need a bit of advice on my first purchase.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been watching the comings and goings, browsing what is on the market just out of curiosity. Now I have a &#039;test&#039; coming up that will require my utmost attention, quite a bit of studying, and ensuring that I can follow procedures to the T.<br /><br />I would just like some advice on what I would purchase to help me prepare for a test like this. I&#039;ve heard of things like &#039;Concerta&#039; or &#039;Adderall&#039; but not too sure what you SR users would recommend something that I would only use a couple of times, that I could receive within 1-2 weeks of purchase.<br /><br />Any advice is greatly appreciated.

				For me I do well on tests on my own if its a subject im not good at a cigarette or two to calm the nerves, but if you want to test silk road out I suggest some adderall or weed :P order domestic and you should get it within your timeframe. Just be sure to read the feedback to make sure the vendor isnt on vacation, or a little behind on orders or anyother possible speedbumps.

				10 mg Dexadrine extended release will do the trick too. I haven&#039;t tried myself, but apparently modafinil 200mg is a great study enhancer. Boosts focus and comcentration, is a cognative enhancer and also has the energy boost similar to dex and adderall.<br /><br />I&#039;d stay away from meth. It can be fun, and in small enough doses might work, but easy to get hooked. It can keep you awake for days though if you keep redosing. If you go this route, try finding some &quot;ICE&quot; speed pills, which have some meth in them and are easy to dose.

				Adderall is a great choice. If you&#039;ve never taken it before, I would start off with a small dose, 10mg. The instant release last about 4-5 hours and extended release around 10-12. YMMV. Take one for studying, and one during the test.<br /><br />I have many different doses of Adderall available on my listings. There&#039;s no minimum order so its a great way to try it out. Orders ship from USA within 24 hours so you&#039;ll receive in just 2-3 days. Feel free to send me a message.&nbsp; :D

				Buy many, many sheets of LSD, and take 1-9 hits twice a day for two weeks as directed by your doctor, slightly increasing the dosage as you progress.&nbsp; This probably won&#039;t help with your test, but it&#039;s probably what I would do if I had a test coming up.

You won&#039;t be able to eat much on adderall which isn&#039;t very good if you need to focus and it&#039;s also way more expensive. Modafinil is only around $1 a pill which is 1-2 doses, piracetam is around $1 a dose too on SR, but if you buy it as a powder on the clearnet it&#039;s way cheaper.<br /><br />Dexedrine is better than adderall because it has less side effects but some people find adderall helps more for focus. If you want amphetamines, vyvanse is the smoothest.

				Apparently 2C-I in low doses is a nootropic... loool, seems like anything that makes you think harder/keeps you awake does the trick... but somehow I think it&#039;d be a little distracting...<br /><br />There are great legal nootropics out there like piracetam/oxiracetam.&nbsp; Combine those with&nbsp; a small amount of cheap amphetamines and kaboom, studying&#039;s never been easier.&nbsp;

				Nootropics<br />+<br />Amphetamine<br /><br />Best study/focus ever.<br /><br />10mg Adderall and a Modafinal would just kill it; taking one or the other would be a pretty big boost.
