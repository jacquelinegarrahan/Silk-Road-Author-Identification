				Hello, I am just wondering the dangers of taking 25-i-nbome, i have read that some people have taken 30 mg doses and been fine but others have taken 500 mcg and been hospitlized. any help would be great<br />What are the chances of OD?<br />How fast does the tolerance go away?<br />What would be a good first dose? (I was planning 1.2 mg)<br />Any other health issues it could cause?

				i&#039;ve done lots of reaserch on 25-i and i&#039;ve never read of people hospitalized on Microdoses, most likley that was due to a combonation of factors, alchohol energy drinks weight etc 25i is a nice drug to try a few times but wouldn&#039;t recommend you switch for mushrooms, If your ordering in Australia I definitely recommendv TheEmpror&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Tolerance takes about two weeks to go away, and pretty much prevents you from using other psychedelics of the same class (LSD, shrooms) for at least the first week.<br /><br />No-one can give you solid answers on its safety, since there has been very little research done on it. Regular use is not something I&#039;d advise, though, for this reason. However, anecdotally speaking, many people have tried it a few times and been fine. I&#039;d say there&#039;s no real chance of OD on 1200ug, but I wouldn&#039;t dose over that myself. Having dosed 1200ug, I see no real need to, either. If you want to go further than that, switch to another psychedelic that can be dosed much higher safely.

				I dont find the above true...<br /><br />I get tabs that are dosed at 1 mg a tab ( 1000 ug ) .... For a hard trip i will take 4 which is 4mg. I have little nausea doing that but definately from the taste it can come...<br /><br />Ive never had any symptoms of OD and ive even taken up to 6 RC tabs for shows and yes I do not recommend it, it couldnt be good for you, but I tripped nuts.<br />

				Personally after hearing a few stories I will be giving this a miss and sticking to the 2-C family until further research has been done into reactions with other drugs and dosages. Does like a great substance though.

				taken up to 3.6mg without any overdose issues. but you&#039;ll be tripping hard. tolerance is comparable to acid and it&#039;s cross tolerant.

				Hi! <br /><br />Well, it is NEVER a bad idea to do an allergy test before attempting a serious experiment. Like you said, people have been hospitalized/died for small doses. Everyone reacts differently. I would start really small (200mcg), and if no negative effects are experienced go a little higher. I actually haven&#039;t tried it myself yet, but I personally know someone who insufflated approx 20mcg and survived/no hospital. GL

				i have used one tab under the tongue for an hour and had an amazing trip i also used another tab soaked in water and then IV it was the day after the first trip and it worked almost instantly but was much much milder due to the tolerance issue... anyway my main point is in my opinion it is safe some people freak out on weed some people just dont handle shit well but i have had only good experiences with it.<br /><br />***<br />live forever die today<br />die today live forever

Having tried (relatively low doses of) shrooms and LSD, I can certainly say 25i gave the most impressive visuals.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard some horror stories about people developing permanent tolerance to psychedelics after (ab)using 25i, or it otherwise affecting their trips (ie. from then on other trips are &#039;like&#039; 25i or something). I just hope there&#039;s no real weight to them as I&#039;d hate to have that happen to me.
