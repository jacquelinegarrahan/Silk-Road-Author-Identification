				I&#039;ve been keeping an eye out but haven&#039;t seen any free samples, just your usual menu with charges beside each product.<br />Am I missing something?

				Not personal, but I would never order from a new vendor based on sample giveaways. It&#039;s the best way to receive addresses of silkroad users by the police.

				yeah im not a new vendor by any means, me and my close real life friend RR both opened our accounts at the same time but we focused on his account anrd i had very little time to list my own items but RR is off taking a break so i can now really start to get things going, there is more weed, coke and a few other bits still to be listed <br /><br />oh and i put 12 free samples out and they where gone in seconds there are no more free samples left now, all free samples where dispached yesterday at 2pm so they will all be delivered today and you will start to see reviews and feedback on the account because the 40 i had have vanished because i did not sell for a long time <br /><br />all orders are dispached 1st class the same day so you will see how next day really should work <br /><br />thanks for looking and i hope to see some of you as customers in the near future :)
