				<br />I had a friend once take me in my car to meet a dealer at a known and busy intersection near a college known for drug activity.... Also, this intersection is usually lit up with cops because of the accidents.&nbsp; <br /><br />The dealer comes out, looking about as fucked up on what he was selling as we wanted to be, and hands me the shit in a baggie in broad fucking daylight during rush hour..............<br /><br />What do you think has the most chance of getting caught/sketchy?&nbsp;

				I&#039;d rather get if from here and not have to deal with sketchy dealers, weird and akward meeting locations, and driving around with that dirt! Both ways have pros and cons!

				I have mostly done deals with people I know or a mutual friend and it has always worked out for me.<br /><br />Plus I always keep my 40cal with me... I&#039;m not some gangster, just an average joe exercising his right to bear arms. <br /><br />But I feel very safe ordering from here, I will probably never order pot, because of the smell, and because I get it cheaper locally.

				I haven&#039;t ordered from here so I can&#039;t comment on how I feel about how safe it is.&nbsp; However when I got my stuff in person it was through people I knew so I didn&#039;t feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; The downside is that you have to have face to face interaction obviously.&nbsp; I think as long as your packages don&#039;t get intercepted SR would probably be safer however there is always that unknown factor between the time your package gets shipped and the time it arrives at your place.
