				Hey all. Instead of spamming my way to 50, I thought I would make sure I have things figured out on here for when I make a purchase down the road.<br /><br />So since I am already here, I assume the next step would be to buy some bitcoins. It seems like Localbitcoins are a good choice, and I have seen that there are a couple sellers in my area which is cool to do a face to face exchange and avoid the bank.<br /><br />Then, it looks like I send it over to my wallet on SR - then I can shop!<br /><br />So here&#039;s my question - Let&#039;s say I find a product I like. I add it to my shopping cart. And under the total it says enter your name and address. If I wanna use PGP, do I just post the encrypted message in there? How would the seller know my public key - do I message them, or just post it on the forums and trust that they will find it?<br /><br />Then I sit and wait patiently, finalize once the order arrives, and leave feedback - I guess my main confusion is getting the vendor the address.<br /><br />Thanks

				I believe you send them your encrypted message + your PGP key<br /><br />They respond with their encrypted message + their PGP key

				In order to send an encrypted message to a vendor you need to import the vendors public key into your PGP program and then encrypt your address using the vendors public key.&nbsp; The vendors public key will be found on the vendors profile page, that is the public key that you will need to copy and paste into your PGP program.<br /><br />Good luck

				Also if your using local bitcoin&#039;s wallet, make sure you wash those coins or at least make an anonymous middleman wallet before you transfer the coins to SR. IMPORTANT

				i just use coinbase linked to my bank account. As far as i understand there hasn&#039;t been any problems with using the built in &#039;fogging&#039; thing silkroad uses when you deposit coins to your account. Please correct me if i&#039;m wrong but has anybody heard anything about any problems with this?

				I believe Forbes just put out an article wherethey had an IT guy track their coins back to them. Check the Security thread. IdI&#039;d do it but I&#039;m pretty burnt right now. Need to crash.

Especially when using a VPN or proxy for extra security when using the site. Get a new SR wallet address every time as well.
