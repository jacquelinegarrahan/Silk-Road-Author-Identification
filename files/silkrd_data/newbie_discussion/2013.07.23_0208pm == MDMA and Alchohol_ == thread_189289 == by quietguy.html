				I have always been told that the two don&#039;t really mix, fancy trying MDMA but when I go out and socialise there&#039;s usually quite large amounts of alcohol involved..<br />So, not recommended then?

				I have taken MDMA after drinking some beers multiple times now, never had any problems.<br />However, MDMA will most likely make you feel great and not even want any alcohol, so you could drink some beers (I guess you shouldn&#039;t be totally wasted), then take it and stop drinking alcohol (start drinking water instead!).<br /><br />My best practice: drink 2-4 beers with mates, talk and wait for everyone to get into the right mood. Then take MDMA and from then on, no more alcohol but lots of water. You will really dry out if you don&#039;t drink enough water on MDMA, so I&#039;d say that drinking alcohol while on MDMA might indeed be a risky idea, as alcohol dehydrates your body as well. But as I said - after taking MDMA, you probably won&#039;t feel any need for alcohol. Play it safe and stick to water from then on. :)<br /><br />Based on my own experience of course.

				Hi Quietguy,<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve done both together quite a bit. Its definitely not something that will kill you, like say xannies and alcohol might.&nbsp; <br />Having said that taking any two or more substances in conjunction with one another is almost always going to put more stress on your liver, kidneys or other vital organs. It&#039;s really up to you. The only drugs you really shouldn&#039;t take with MDMA are any sort of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs; antidepressants) and for two reasons;<br />1. you probably won&#039;t feel the affects<br />2. you may develop Serotonin syndrome... which can lead to death<br /><br />MD is great becuase it&#039;s pretty forgiving i.e. it is almost physically impossible to die from overdose because the dosage needed is so high. People do however fall off the bandwagon when it comes to water, often to much or too little. Don&#039;t go crazy, if you&#039;re dancing and sweating and drinking whilst on MD, it&#039;s advised to drink 1-1.5 bottles of water each hour. <br /><br />Hope this helps, holla if you need more info.<br /><br />

				Does alcohol not nullify the effects of the MDMA?<br /><br />From what I remember, when the rave scene was big, all those places seemed to sell was bottled water.

				i think mdma makes you hold your pee whereas alcohol makes you go to the toilet often, and i think those two don&#039;t mix, a couple beers wouldn&#039;t be a problem though i guess<br />if you decide to drink though do it with some restraint, little sips is better

				Ive done both before--taking Molly after being pretty fucked up(drunk,about 8 drinks)and it is still a great time, but I felt like I didnt remember as much when rolling, I didnt feel the coming up as much, and I felt worse afterwards.&nbsp; I always feel like i feel the MDMA more when I just take it completely sober or only after a few beers.&nbsp; You feel the come up, which i love, you get that buddy buzz/tingly feeling more and remember the experience a lot more.&nbsp; Make sure you drink water after taking the molly but you dont need to drown yourself in it.&nbsp; A cup of water every hour should be fine.&nbsp; Ive had less then that an hour and drank before and still was fine afterwards.

				1.&nbsp; Don&#039;t drive.&nbsp; Mixing ETOH with stimulants is great fun but you wind up drunker than you think you are.<br />2.&nbsp; You&#039;re kinda screwing up a glorious (and expensive) MDMA experience, wtf?<br />3.&nbsp; Both ETOH and MDMA make you dehydrated, if you have to drink, consider alternating ETOH with water.<br />4.&nbsp; Too much ETOH plus too much MDMA = amnesia.&nbsp; Kind of a weird feeling.&nbsp; &quot;Did I have fun last night?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Oh yeah, you were great.&nbsp; You were talking to this really hot chick.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Was she into me?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Oh yeah, she was all over you.&quot;&nbsp; (This, after waking up in a hotel room with a bunch of nasty, smelly guys, and no chick.)<br />5.&nbsp; Plan the flight, fly the plan.&nbsp; Whatever you intend to do with MDMA, make a plan, write it down, put it in your wallet.&nbsp; You won&#039;t be able to read it of course, but the fact of making this plan is helpful.&nbsp; This can be VERY helpful for keeping you out of trouble with ETOH.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a sample plan I used one night:<br /><br />a) Drop at 10.<br />b) Re-dose with half pill at 11.<br />c) No more MDMA.<br />d) Exactly three drinks, no more.<br />e) Exactly 500ml of water per hour.<br />f) Don&#039;t give bathroom attendant more than $10, no matter what a lovely human being he is.<br />g) Don&#039;t lose the girls.&nbsp; (Long story)

				A small amount of alcohol is fine, but if you drink to much I think it dampens the effects a little, I really find it takes a way from the whole experience. <br /><br />That being said, if you take 200mg of MDMA and have like 6 beers you&#039;re still going to be out of your brains!
