				forgot to answer your second question. you can try localbitcoins.com to find someone local to trade cash for bitcoins with. i&#039;ve done it once with good luck. although they had an 8% markup so don&#039;t think i&#039;ll be doing it again.

				If you use the BitInstant method, do you send the Bitcoins directly to your SR wallet address?&nbsp; Or are you supposed to send them somewhere else first, and then transfer them to SR?&nbsp; I am so confused about how to buy Bitcoins and get them into SR.<br /><br />Also, I have a Bank of America within walking distance to me, so if anyone can explain the &quot;BofA&quot; method I would appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I have found Bitinstant to be both fast and reliable.<br /><br />I prefer to use their service where I deposit (i.e., pay) cash at a local Walmart or CVS and send it to my SR bitcoin address (i.e., wallet). This only takes a couple hours from start to finish. Bitinstant charges 3.99 percent plus a flat $3.95 charge.<br /><br />It may be more secure to use other, intermediate services, such as Dwolla, Virwox, or Mt. Gox. However those services often require you to have a verified account, and they take an additional commission.<br /><br />I note that Silk Road allows you to change your bitcoin wallet address at any time.<br /><br />JeanRob

				I bought some coin with cash in the mail:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/155<br /><br />You pay a bit more for it, 10% in my case, but the coin turns up right in your SR account real easy and I got the bc in 30 hours from posting. And it is about as anonymous as you can get.<br /><br />Just make sure you check the vendor out properly - and then hope s/he is not to stoned to sort shit out&nbsp; ;)

				Others have already mentioned localbitcoins.com; I&#039;ve had success there using Bauhaus (via citibank cash deposit). I&#039;ve also used btcquick.com and been pretty happy. It is not at all anonymous, so you might want to use a mixer to remove any taint before transferring your coin to an SR wallet.

				Ya, I saw Bauhuas as a local bitcoin vendor myself... Was considering working with him...&nbsp; seeing as bitinstant is down as of yesterday I believe, for what seems like a complete overhaul... not sure if this is good or bad... they&#039;re not really giving any information out at this time.<br /><br />Anyone have any experience with bitstamp or any other legit exchange services. NOT really wanting to use Mtgox, considering their validation of everything personable.
