This is their second maint of the day, first one took about 15 mins. Having said this. I have never once had a problem getting my coins on the road, placing an order or, getting what I order. However, I deal in peanuts and am only here for top shelf marijuana at personal amounts. <br /><br />Did I mention that if you are here for fine cannabis. LionswareTrading has the best flowers I have ever seen. Manicured beautifully, I shed a tear every time I put a cola in the grinder. Their edibles and hash&#039;s are top shelf also. You will pay top shelf price. However, it always ways heavy, and that is not counting the extra samples they toss out from time too time. =)

They are not illegal, think of it as buying any other commodity. You also cannot buy them with a credit/debit card. It has too be a wire transaction. I will go through my entire process. Now, mind you it took me 3 days to place my first order. I have not looked back since. My way may not be the correct way too others, but. Isn&#039;t what this thing is all about, the individual? So, here goes.<br /><br />1). I go too ***(clearnet warning)*** www.bitinstant.com I fill out the required fields (unless someone knows you well at a location, you can use any name you like /address/phone etx). It will then give me a list of stores in the area that will accept money grams/red phones from bitinstant (gives you a listing of the closest spot too you via mapquest). They send me an email with a voucher where I have 120 hours to cash it in (I use mtgox because the site has not failed me. They are expensive, though).<br /><br />2). I take my happy ass to the location (walmart/usps is my drug trafficer) fill out the money gram (I normally snag a couple money grams while there so I can do it at home and make the process quicker) No I.D. required, you do have to sign a receipt, though. I never use my real name and just scribble some shit down,...ha. ***~!If use an offline wallet! If you do too (and you should) make sure you sync it up!~*** The entire process takes me about 35 mins. It&#039;s upping to SR (tumblrs) that takes the longest.<br /><br />3). I get home, go too mtgox buy my coins, send them through my wallets, couple more wallets..then too SR. <br /><br />4). Place order, sit back and relax.<br /><br />5). I have FE early from my 1st purchase and have every&nbsp; one since. I advise against it, as will a lot of vendors. However if you be patient, read the forums, read feedback, read the vendors pages, communicate with them...be respectful and not some punk kid, (goes both ways, buyers and vendors) your bags will all be heavy no matter what you plan on purchasing, and your smiles will be wide.<br /><br />Best of luck, Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the SRoad. =)

				I also have used bitinstant with no problems or worries. You do not have to disclose what you are spending your money #1 and #2 buying bitcoins is not illegal.<br />It took me a few days to figure it out and work up to doing it, but now that I have, it&#039;s pretty easy I would sayk<br /><br />I am running into an issue though...and Qthello, maybe you can help me?...<br />I am trying to place an order (and as you can see by my post #&#039;s, I&#039;m brand new) and I am having real trouble with this pgp thing. I know it&#039;s some kind of encryption but I do not know how to unscramble it, nor do I know how to write my own. To make matters even more difficult, I saw a post on how to download gpg4win but I am using a second anatomizer and that runs on a Linux program. <br /><br />So, I don&#039;t know what I can do to get past the pgp issue.&nbsp; It Qthello, or anyone else has any advice on what I can do and how to do it, I would really appreciate any tips!<br />Thanks
