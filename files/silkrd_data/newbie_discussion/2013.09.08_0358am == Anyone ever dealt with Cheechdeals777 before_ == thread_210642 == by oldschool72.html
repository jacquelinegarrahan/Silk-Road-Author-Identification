				With Bitinstant out of the picture, I was looking for a way to buy bitcoins and came across the SR vendor Cheechdeals777.&nbsp; His feedback was good, so I decided to give him a try.&nbsp; He advertises 12 hour turnaround, and his feedback included testimonials of 2 or 3 hour service.&nbsp; His instructions were to simply buy a Moneypak, then buy one of his $0.00 SR listings and include the MP code and amount in the space usually reserved for the address.&nbsp; I started with $400--that was four days ago.<br /><br />I know SR experienced a slowdown for a couple days, but not four days.&nbsp; And he&#039;s neither responding to or even reading my messages, in spite of having logged on every day.&nbsp; He&#039;s already cashed the MP code, so it looks like I have zero recourse.<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering if other people have had good or bad experiences with him.<br />

				I&#039;m in the same boat. He cashed my $545 MP then stopped replying and now his page is gone. I feel as if there is nothing we can do at this point.

				I wish there was a way to get this asshole back. All that money was to buy my girl friend mood stabilizers that she needs.

				He stole $250 from me as well. There&#039;s nothing we can do laties and gents. I&#039;m taking this experience as a learned lesson. I knew this could happen, yet still proceeded all willie nillie. And here I am. No bitcoins, no moneypak, and no drugs. I&#039;m just going to be patient for now on. coinbase is now my hero, even though it takes forever. you guys that lost $500+, thanks for making me feel better about my situation.<br /><br />Edit: according to SR support staff, there is nothing they can do. I knew this was going to be the response, I just figured I&#039;d ask. I feel as if they should figure out some sort of system to middle man moneypak, vanilla, reloadit trades. <br />There&#039;s no way making a middle man system is that hard.

				I went with localbitcoins.com and had an excellent experience.&nbsp; The rate was just under Mt.Gox, but the btc were in my wallet by the time I got back from the bank, and the transfer over to my SR wallet was 15 minutes.&nbsp; The person I bought them from responded to my messages immediately and was nice to deal with.&nbsp; The downside is that they&#039;re still more expensive than the SR rate

				The piece of shit got me for $480 on a moneypak.&nbsp; He deleted his vendor page.&nbsp; Do I just cancel the order under my order section. It just says processing.&nbsp; If I cancel it, will it hurt my buyer stats at all?
