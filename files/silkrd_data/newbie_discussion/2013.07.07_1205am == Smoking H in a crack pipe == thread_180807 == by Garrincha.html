				Never used a crack pipe for H (don&#039;t know where to buy one, and even if I did, I wouldn&#039;t want to keep such a thing in my house), but freebasing it has always been my preferred way to use it.&nbsp; It hits you SO hard that way.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best H high you&#039;ll get without injecting it.

				There may be other ways to do it, but this is how I was taught.&nbsp; You will need aluminum foil, a pen or a drinking straw, and (ideally) a piece of Scotch tape.&nbsp; Oh, and a cigarette lighter.<br /><br />First, cut a smallish square of foil (about 4 in. x 4 in.).&nbsp; Roll this piece of foil around the pen, not too tight, so it makes a tube around the pen.&nbsp; Tape the tube together with the tape (otherwise it gets loose and unrolls).&nbsp; Then gently pull the pen out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once you&#039;ve got the pen out, you are left with an aluminum foil tube, about the size of a drinking straw.<br /><br />Rip off another piece of aluminum foil, and put a bit of H on it.&nbsp; Position the aluminum foil straw over the H, and light the cigarette lighter underneath the H.&nbsp; As the H burns, smoke will rise from it, and you inhale the smoke with the aluminum foil straw.<br /><br />You have to inhale the smoke gently.&nbsp; If you suck too hard, you&#039;ll end up sucking up the chunks of burning H into the straw, where they get stuck.&nbsp; This is not such a bad thing if it happens, though.&nbsp; You just make a new aluminum foil straw, and use it to smoke the stuff off the old straw.<br /><br />You CAN use a plastic straw, instead of making an aluminum foil one, but there&#039;s always the chance it&#039;ll melt.&nbsp; Also, the more H you do with the straw, the more the inside of it gets coated with a layer of melted H.&nbsp; If you use an aluminum foil straw, at the end you can unroll it and get one last hit off that coating of melted H.

				Yeah, I have chased the dragon before, attempting a similar method to that described, but it is so fiddly and wasteful, and I never really got the hang of it. <br />With the crack pipe (which is just a small glass pipe bought in headshops) method, all you need is to put some wire wool in the pipe, put the H on top, then hold the flame at a distance so that the H doesn&#039;t burn but rather gives off the vapor that you inhale.
