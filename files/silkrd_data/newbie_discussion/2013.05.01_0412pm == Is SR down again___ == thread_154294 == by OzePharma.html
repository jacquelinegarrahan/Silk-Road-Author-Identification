				Chill out mate, its all good. Nothing to worry about. Ye the site is down again. It will come back whenever DPR sorts it out. Have faith Im sure he is working constantly to sort it out. And in terms of sending your coin to the wrong address. If you have send it to a completly wrong address then there is nothing you can do. The coin will be gone forever. If you have just send it to your own account but not the one your meant to then there is nothing to worry about. As soon as SR is back up it will be sitting there waiting for you, and you can move the coin freely. Nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Just take time and check back later or tomorrow and SR hopefully will be operational

				Just relax man. One thing you could try is requesting a new identity in your tor client and trying again.

				I can&#039;t get on right now either. I&#039;ve had two orders from SweetLeafLondon processing since Saturday now and have been trying to check on their status all day, and it seems that refreshing my Tor identity a few times will get me a few minutes of access, but it&#039;ll fail after a while. This is very annoying.

				SR is- intermittent for now.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t complete something, have a beer or a smoke or what have you and try again in a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had timeout errors about 5 times this morning, but it&#039;s come back eventually each time
