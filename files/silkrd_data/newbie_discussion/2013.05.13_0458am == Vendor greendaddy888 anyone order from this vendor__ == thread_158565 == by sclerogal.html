				Hi,<br /><br />1. I would like to know if anyone ordered from this vendor, and if they asked you not to PGP/GPA your response (address information) since they are having issues opening it.&nbsp; They also suggest emailing through this forum and getting address information.<br />2. This vendor states his Percocet 10mg and 5mg are a counterfeit copy made in india, but they are genuine percocet, but they ay not be as strong as other brand name opiates.<br /><br />Anyone with experience on this?

				I have an order scheduled to be delivered tomorrow from him. I sent via privnote and that was okay. I would rather use GPG but I am okay with that for now.<br /><br />I will update this thread on potency and see if they are actually worth the time and money. Some reviews on his page suggest he is also not using any stealth. I will also comment on that and make sure to let you know. I am not as concerned with pills and stealth but we will see what happens.<br /><br />Cheers

				I have never done business with them but I can say that they don&#039;t produce oxycodone in India.&nbsp; It&#039;s not going to be oxycodone.&nbsp; Possibly codiene or hydrocodone at best.&nbsp; I have seen homemade codiene pills from India being sold as hydros and percs.

				I attempted to contact Greendaddy888 vendor to cancel my order since it&#039;s been in processing status all day.&nbsp; I advised him since he was unable to tell me what the actual potency of the percocet was and I&nbsp; need assurance that it contains oxycodone, I wanted to cancel.&nbsp; He/she reply&#039;s they have already been mailed out.&nbsp; I said to vendor, ok as long as it&#039;s authentic oxycodone, but may not be full potency, I&#039;ll pay you.&nbsp; I will take a home drug test which tests for opiates (I have a specific one).&nbsp; I am a pain management patient and get tested for certain metabolites.&nbsp; I will make sure prior to taking any of greendaddy&#039;s pills I am opiate free.&nbsp; AFter the drug test, if I am positive, I will release funds, and clear the two questionable feed backs from early this eve (prior to me submitting/cancelling order).

				If anyone has tried Greendaddys 30 mg roxis please let me know. I currently have cancer and its very likely I am going to die within 2 years. I am trying to cut costs on pain meds because the amount i am spending is around 1k a month alone for the pain medications and stability meds etc. <br /><br />I know 33 is cheap and I am willing to loose 40 dollars if need be, however that is 40 dollars towards a real script. Dont get me wrong, I have access to pain meds and more than enough, its just very expensive and if these are even at 50 percent than it would be worth it. Can someone please post a for certain, clear statement as to what amount, if any these pills have? Any help before I order would be great. Thank you!

				I ordered the Roxy sample from Greendaddy888 also. They were all junk. I ate a few of the Roxy&#039;s, felt nothing, and I broke one of the other pills in half and gave it a lick and it was very sweet, pretty much just a sugar pill. So my advice to anyone is just stay away. There are plenty of solid vendors, prices are a little steep in most cases, but the products are good.

				So, there was no oxycodone or hydrocodone.&nbsp; What are you going to do with this purchase?&nbsp; Dispute it by going into resolution?&nbsp; Just curious what people are doing once they realized these were fakes.&nbsp; To me there is a huge difference between saying &quot;I&#039;m not sure how much oxycodone/hydrocode is in the pills, but for there to be none is a scam.

				It is definitely a scam.&nbsp; I sent him a msg stating that it was obvious that there was no oxy or hydro in my order and I want him to cancel on his end and reimburse me.&nbsp; He gave me a song and dance about how we can&#039;t expect full strength pills for a fraction of the price and he doesn&#039;t see why everyone is complaining.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to reply to him again and reiterate that I would have been more than satisfied with a weaker product, but I cannot release funds to him for a product that is completely false.<br /><br />If he still refuses a refund (which I assume he will), I will take my order into resolution, but I&#039;ve never had to do that before on any of my orders.&nbsp; Does it work?&nbsp; I hope I&#039;m not the only one refusing to finalize and we&#039;ll have some chance of a refund.&nbsp; Is there any other action to take?

				I really wanted to order his 100 suboxone for ~2.8 btc. It&#039;s a crazy good deal, and it sort of was somewhat reasonable to think your paying for bulk.<br /><br />I added it to my cart to see how many he had available so I could run out and buy some more btc before he ran out and he had 100 orders available. That would be 10,000 suboxone pills... which is... a little unbelievable? I didn&#039;t want to come right out and accuse a vendor of anything just based on me thinking something sounded wrong, but now I&#039;m glad as hell I didn&#039;t order. I thought about pointing out how crazy it sounded on the forums... I probably should have. <br /><br />Hope things work out for you all who got scammed.

				I seem to have had the same experience with greendaddy888 that most everyone else has had. I ordered the 10 x 30mg oxycodone sampler pack, and the 15 pill benzo sampler pack from this vendor on Saturday May 11th, and it was placed in transit that day. <br /><br />Before I ordered I messaged greendaddy888 several times. It seemed like English was his second language, but he did seem straightforward, and earnest. Based on the couple of messages we exchanged, and a few positive reviews were enough to convince me to try his sampler packs. I paid for Priority shipping, and asked him to message me with an expected delivery date, based on the tracking. He stated that he &quot;was not the postman&quot; and didn&#039;t know when it would be delivered, despite the fact that there should have been tracking with Priority shipping. I did not want the tracking number, just an expected delivery date. <br /><br />When the item hadn&#039;t arrived by Wednesday, which I thought was a reasonable amount of time for a domestic Priority shipped package, he failed to respond. It appears that he has not even read my message despite the fact that he has been online everyday. On Friday the 17th my package arrived, and without going into any specifics that could be detrimental to anyone else that has ordered, the packaging was IMO very poor, and unsafe. Greendaddy888 used a private courier, not USPS, which would allow the package to be searched with out a warrant. The product itself was not hidden, or sealed in any kind of protective packaging that would have prevented its viewing or smell if there had been any.<br /><br />As for the product itself, the oxycodone sampler included the 10 x 30mg pills that were ordered, as well as 2 5/325 &quot;Endocets&quot; and 2 x 8mg Bupernorphine (orange suboxone), which was not in the description. The oxy sampler consisted of 6 of the pills with a k 9 imprint, and 4 V 48 12 imprints, and none of the a 218s. As for the benzo sampler it contained all &quot;Xanax&quot; while the description had said it would contain xanax, kolonpins, and valium. In fairness in one of my messages I did ask about the product and stated that I preferred Xanax, so I don&#039;t know if it was intentional or not that was the only &quot;benzo&quot; I received. None of the products seem to contain any active ingredients. <br /><br />I have reported this vendor to SR, and am currently waiting for a response from greendaddy888 and the SR admins. I have not finalized the transaction as I am waiting for instructions on how to proceed. I know that people have different feelings on this, but as I see it, while I was not expecting the product to be as strong as the licensed version, the vendor stated that they would contain an unknown quantity of active ingredient. I am currently also trying to find a way to chemically test these products, which I would appreciate any suggestions on how to do so. One idea was to go to my local drug store, and purchase an over the counter home drug test, dissolve a pill of each in water, and use the urinalysis test to see if they register any positives. I did try the pills by oral administration, insuffelation, and I did give two to others to try IVing. There was absolutely no high felt from any ROA!<br /><br />The only potential use I can see for this product is to scam others, which is not something I am willing to do.<br /><br />TL;DR: BUNK PRODUCT, ONLY GOOD FOR SCAMMING, DO NOT BUY AND SPREAD THE WORD

				&nbsp;The guide lines on the wiki described a no harm to others policy. I don&#039;t think SR really wants to be in business of scamming, defrauding, and stealing from others.&nbsp; I doubt they would allow customers to knowing buy fraudulent pills to turn around and sell to defraud others.&nbsp; Also the wiki states &quot;You must describe your listings accurately and truthfully. If you do not, it will be reflected in your feedback ratings and you will lose business. We have zero tolerance for any kind of scamming or cheating and have taken many precautions to guard against it&quot;<br /><br />Does this sound like SR is in support of any of the tactics greedaddy888 MAYBE using? Don&#039;t&nbsp; think so...

				One more thing...I requested a refund from greendaddy888, and he said that I new what I was buying and he was not responsible for knowing what was in the pills.&nbsp; I explained to him as a Seller your completely responsible for knowing what&#039;s in what you are selling.

				I took my order into resolution.&nbsp; At first this really angered him (judging by his long rant of insults), but then he agreed to give me a full refund as long as I sent back all of his product that I had left.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what caused this sudden turnaround, but he should receive it today, so maybe I&#039;ll actually get my money back!

				I know why... I just saw an advertisement for free &quot;fake&quot; pills from Greendaddy888. He maybe recouping his costs in shipping?&nbsp; Not sure about that.&nbsp; This can cause a VERY bad reputation for SR.&nbsp; I think Admin really needs to get involved here since this goes against the guidelines on the WIKI, &quot;no harm to others&quot;&nbsp; I think this should apply to ALL people, whether on SR or the rest of the community

				Not exactly what I wanted to start out with here on the forums but this just makes me so mad! I don&#039;t understand why he is being allowed&nbsp; to continue on SR...why doesn&#039;t&nbsp; he get kicked off for being a scammer when it is obvious that he has scammed many people. As a new vendor, I watch what other vendors are selling &amp; their prices to stay competitive &amp; learn. His listings for these didn&#039;t even start out labeling them as fake or counterfeit, just from India! That is scamming. It&#039;s vendors like this that make it hard for people to try to vendors..of course they should be! This is their money &amp; personal information they are trusting to someone &amp; you can&#039;t get all of that back. I know the world has bad people in it &amp; that&#039;s life but that doesn&#039;t mean I have to like it...anyway that&#039;s my rant...
