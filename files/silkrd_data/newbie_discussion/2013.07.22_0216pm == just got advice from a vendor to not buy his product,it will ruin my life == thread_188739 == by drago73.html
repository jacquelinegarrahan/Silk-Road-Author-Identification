				I gotta admit, at first i was a little offended at reply to my question. But i have quickly got over it and see that i should have asked this question on these forums rather than in a pm to vendor. Am impressed with the response from them actually. Nice to see a human being in their response as opposed to just a drug dispensary. The question was sort of a noobie question, so i can understand his/her response. I&#039;m an experienced opiate user, however it&#039;s been a few years since i was a daily user with a high tolerance.<br /><br />Anyway, my question was/is this: if i do a little h one day, can i take some methadone the next day and still get a buzz, or will the methadone not give me a buzz because i still have an opiate in my system. Or more importantly, can i take methadone one day, and the following day do h and get a buzz from the h. In other words, i know that methadone is primarily used as a substitute for h, but will it block my system and not allow me to get a buzz from h or any other opiates? Please help if you have answer. Thanks

				Yes you can still get a buzz from methadone after doing H, and vice versa.<br /><br />Methadone only &#039;blocks&#039; you from getting a buzz if you are doing so much of it that your brain&#039;s opiate receptors are used to being jam packed full of opiates from taking methadone all the time.&nbsp; Methadone lasts a really long time, and if you did it every day your opiate receptors would be pretty full and other opiates wouldn&#039;t have as much effect because you would be used to having that methadone in your system, so you would need to do much more H to get past the methadone.

				To limit or reverse opiate or opioid tolerance, keeping naltraxone, bupropion and methadone handy is something I&#039;d highly suggest.<br /><br />Methadone is commonly used to avoid severe opioid withdrawal symptoms by replacing something like herion.<br /><br />It&#039;s used to &quot;step down&quot; serum levels of opiates so that your u-opioid neural receptors have a chance to get used to not being glutted with heroin or whatever. u-opioid receptors do eventually bounce back from a heavy tolerance, but you have to give them a chance to do so. Methadone provides a temporary opioid to gradually reduce in dosage until you return to having a low tolerance to opiates.<br /><br />Naltraxone is a u-opioid antagonist, also known as an opioid blocker. It stuffs u-opioid neural receptors without actually activating it, taking up the space opiates usually key into to activate opioid neurons which provide the orgasmic pleasure and pain eradication effects associated with drugs like heroin and other opiates.<br /><br />Bupropion is a dopaminergic antidepressant that is also commonly used to help cigarette addicts to stop having uncontrollable cravings for nicotine and other addictive substances.<br /><br />Bupropion, by activating the same dopamine pleasure circuits at a lower level&nbsp; stimulation to reduce the utter lack of stimulation that causes intense cravings.<br /><br />Combining methadone, naltraxone and buproprion can help to give your body a chance to recover a low tolerance so you get more out of the same amount of herion, saving money in the long run.<br /><br />With smart usage of methadone, naltraxone and bupropion, it is possible, at least in theory, to have the same level of orgasmic transcendental experience as your very first time using heroin, &quot;catching up with the dragon&quot; so to speak.

				I take 175 mgs of methadone daily, i rarely get a buzz off my dose anymore, but if i do some h or get a buzz on an opiate in the morning, when i take my mdone a few hours later, it has much more of an effect. H the day before should have no effect at all on the done, unless you have that morning after glow and you dose the mdone, then it might kick your ass a little more, just thought id throw in some input, im on the program and ive run into just about every scenario with the mdone. It seems like in my experience most opiates before or after methadone just act like extra methadone, sometimes adds a little euphorio/nodding to the done, as long as you dont feel any effect from the h anymore, it shouldnt effect the mdone whatsoever~
