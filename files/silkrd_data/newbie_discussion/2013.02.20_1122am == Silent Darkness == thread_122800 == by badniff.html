				It&#039;s like the hard mode of tripping. Every sense distracts from the complete tranformation of mind that psychedelics can induce. Everything you see has associations, your home contains emotional energy and the music you listen to is the expression of feelings and thoughts. These things shape an experience, not necessarily in a bad way, but in a sometimes predictable way.<br /><br />When you are in the dark, without sound, everything changes. You will&nbsp; meet fears, past experiences and people you didn&#039;t know you valued. I hope everyone tries this at least once, for the amount of personal development one undergoes in the sensory deprived state is monumental.

				Even if you didn&#039;t feel scared at first, that would come. If you have a sitter than you could start of with music, ease you into the trip, and then tell him to turn it off. Should make it a bit easier to let go of fear.

In a sensory deprived state, you mind gets creative and changes, your ego gets disassembled, reassembled. &quot;Fun&quot; does not begin to describe the meaning and beauty one can find in nothing. Being in silent darkness can make your drug express itself stronger, giving you more for less dosage.<br /><br />Drugs aren&#039;t just for fun. They have so many uses :)

Being among people, at events and whatnot, can induce a vertigo-like state in me. Yes a harder trip perhaps, but even less pleasant. I remember going through a bar when shroomed, shocked at how rude people where to each others. Every joke was at the expense of somebody else. The general lack of creativity and dignity was mind-numbing and made me realise the extent of the ordinary-guy-psychosis. Horrible experience, but very rewarding in the long run.<br /><br />But my experience is that tripping is a skill that can be refined like any other. SD gives the drugs a vast expanse to fill, and teaches one a lot about how the drugs work and how ones mind works. I do not agree that it is different each time, I have had many similar shroom experiences on high doses, and today I had a 2C-B trip that reminded me a lot about shrooms. But that it is different depending on person, I have no way of knowing ;)

I ate 1.5 grams of some super potent penis envy shrooms and laid down with the lights off and no music or anything for a couple hours...it was very pleasant for the most part. I think I have controlled the fear with accepting it at the start and it goes away. Then it gets fun... Good stuff!&nbsp; ;)

(OMG that sounds like Harry Potter lol) I accepted my loss of life during an altered state of mind. I thought I will die and sometimes I was sure I just died and this must be some state of afterlife. <br /><br />Now I just smoke some pot if I want to or take some happy_whatever_drug to be, well happy (or have more fun having sex) I know for some years now that I am polytox and hey I love my addictions every single of them.<br /><br />Tripping on the other hand is much more to me. I really dont think LSD is for everyone. No I firmly believe it is NOT for everyone. You have to die once on a psychedelic trip to fully understand what (can) happen. <br />I love to trip but only for fun or maybe to make my brain able to sort things out. But I am no longer in the high doses. It is just not what I want from it.<br /><br />Hard to explain, hehe.<br /><br />./pew! pew!

				I&#039;ve tried this and I like it. In fact, I&#039;ve wanted to try a true sensory deprivation tank (even without tripping) since it has similar effects on the mind. The mind does not like being without feedback and in absence of any feedback it will generate its own.
