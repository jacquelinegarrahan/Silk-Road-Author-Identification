				Greetings guys and girls....<br /><br />Ok, I&#039;m thinking of buying one of these pre-made Darknet USB sticks that a few vendors have for sale and I&#039;m wondering how do I make sure that its clean and safe once I get it? I&#039;m not a total newbie...just think someone with more experience might do a better job on these than I would...but at the same time I&#039;m a little paranoid and fairly new to Linux..i have worked on a server or 2 and used Knoppix to fix my windows machine once. Any feedback or suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I would not buy anything like that on SR.. <br />Could have anything on the USB..<br /><br />Make your own Live Tails USB or similar with the USB installer from Linux. Think its called Pendrive from Linux or something.<br /><br />Its basic.

				I have only seen these available from UglySurfer and while you could make your own for less I think it&#039;s worthwhile purchase.&nbsp; The drives used are the highest quality available and really do account for the majority of the expense.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to linux, i2p, gpg, true crypt, etc...&nbsp; so it&#039;s been helpful to have tech support available.&nbsp; Messages could be answered faster and it can take longer than I&#039;d like to get answers to my questions but at least I am able to get the answers from someone who clearly has the experience and knowledge to provide me the right answer.

				It is never a good idea to buy one of these prebuilt USBs from SR.&nbsp; You can just as easily create your own and know exactly what is on it because you installed it yourself.

				I would never use one of these. The main source of botnets are from pirated software especially Windows. I own all my software now, I&#039;m no ones bot.
