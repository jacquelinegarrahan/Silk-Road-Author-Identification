				Mt. Gox is having issues broadcasting transactions, which is why your deposit hasn&#039;t showed up yet. There was a thread on bitcointalk about how withdrawal/deposit is failing.<br /><br />You can force an update using these instructions which were posted on reddit (warning, clearnet!): http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c79a5/mtgox_has_closed_bitcoin_withdrawal/c9dphz6

				I can&#039;t even access the site atm. I&#039;m glad I never decided to do business through them. For anything about bitinstant/mtgox/bitfloor etc etc I&#039;d head over to bitcointalk they&#039;re pretty active over there. I know bitinstant even has an active customer service rep on the newbie forum.

				We were informed some weeks ago by a reliable source that mt.gox would be adding LTC as a trading currency and doing so involves some major work to the already shitty infrastructure.<br />Systems will be down regularly for some time until support is added- don&#039;t know when but we were told &quot;soon&quot;.<br />This is badly affecting BTC prices and investors trust in crypto-currency stability which is why prices have crashed- dont cash out now, wait until the price rises once again. If you must cash out, buy LTC at an exchange.
