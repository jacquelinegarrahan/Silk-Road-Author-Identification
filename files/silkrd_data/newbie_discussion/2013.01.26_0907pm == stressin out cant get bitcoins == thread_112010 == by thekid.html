				Mtgox.com is a good way to purchase bitcoins. <br />But since you already have a moneygram, I would suggest messaging a vendor on the main site that deals with&nbsp; Â£$ to BTC( that would be the money section, I would find the link for you but TOR is going slow for me )<br />Tell them your dilemma. Try to choose a vendor who has been there for a long time with lots of transactions. and do research on the vendor in the forums if you decide on doing business with them.

				not sure how money gram works. Im a newbie also and took the easy way out,,&nbsp; I used sugar mama (highly recommended in the forum) for my bitcoins. you buy a moneypack, send sugarmama the total amount,&quot; be patient&quot; and the coins will be deposited in your SR account. it took 3 days to get in my account but i wasn&#039;t in a hurry. read sugar mama&#039;s profile and go from there .hope that helps.

				At first, getting bitcoins can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Follow these instructions:<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.

				Isn&#039;t Mt Gox demanding ID to set up an account now? I don&#039;t know why anyone would do that if that is the case.

Gox account would be if you&#039;re trading big money. With an unverified throwaway account, you can withdraw up to 200 BTC or $1,000.00 per 24 hours, limited to $10,000.00 per 30 days. I doubt that most SR buyers are spending that kind of money on drugs; and even vendors, suppliers, and dealers--who probably DO spend more than $1,000 per day--can just open as many throwaway accounts as they need.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay

Gox is still anonymous as long as you&#039;re not trading large amounts of cash.<br /><br />If you want to avoid BitInstant for whatever reason, here are some alternatives:<br /><br />--&nbsp; http://tradebitcoin.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />--&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />--&nbsp; https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Link your bank account and buy bitcoins online. Instant transfers after verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://www.nanaimogold.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Similar to BitInstant. Use MoneyGram &amp; Western Union to fund account.<br /><br />No matter what you do, you lose some or all of your anonymity when buying coins; therefore, you should &quot;launder&quot; them.<br /><br />Here are some sites to route your coins through before depositing them at Silk Road:<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://mtgox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet.<br />--&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet.<br />--&nbsp; https://easywallet.org/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet.<br />--&nbsp; http://ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion/&nbsp; --&nbsp; OnionWallet. Anonymous eWallet, also launders bitcoins.<br />--&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinfog.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Launders bitcoins.<br /><br />After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, I suggest sending them through BlockChain, EasyWallet, and then OnionWallet. From there, send them to Silk Road. Also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address for every transaction. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance? Recently, an SR vendor was busted and had his coins confiscated because authorities were able to trace his transactions.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay

				localbitcoins.com is the way to go. From the time I created an account to when I actually got my BTC&#039;s was about 12 minutes. It takes minutes with that site not days like mtgox

				CampBX works pretty well.&nbsp; They accept USPS money orders so you dont have to deal with money gram/moey order fees.

This would work in a pinch--but only if it was the only method available to me. It&#039;s simply too slow. When I decide to purchase bitcoins, I run down the street and it&#039;s a done deal. A couple of hours later, my funds are with SR and I&#039;m ready to order. Using CampBX, a person would have to plan a week or two ahead just to get high. It&#039;s bad enough that we have to wait for the mailman to get our dope.

				*** IMPORTANT UPDATE ***<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Do not use OnionWallet (http://ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion/)--it is a SCAM. I transferred a small amount of money in there and it was immediately stolen. The entire website, as legit as it looks, is bogus. After the theft occurred, I did some research and found out that this has happened to a lot of people.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;*** OnionWallet is a SCAM ***

Basically, I&#039;ve been experimenting for the last two days with different sites, services, exchanges, and methods of obtaining bitcoins. I should have been more careful and done my homework on OnionWallet. Since I was only tinkering, the amount I lost was insignificant. What can I say? I&#039;ve never been scammed before. I was careless.

				biggest concern with getting bitcoins is all the exchangers started using KYC (know your customer). You&#039;d have to find a single trustable exchanger who operates privately. I offer private anonymous bitcoin excahnge, at relatively low costs if anyone is interested shoot me a pm.

				My only problem with localbitcoins, is that everyone on that site may or may not&nbsp; be a SR Vendor or Buyer.&nbsp; I feel safer giving my open info to bitinstant. CampBX - a lot can happen in btc value in a few days, or does the site hedge the mo?<br /><br />I loss a few hundred bucks overnight once.

				the site doesn&#039;t hedge which makes localbitcoins a bit bullshit, but if you&#039;re using it to conduct transactions on SR it doesn&#039;t really matter since SR sellers are pegged to regular currencies anyway. Most good exchangers on localbitcoins will deal outside of localbitcoins in real time.

				Currently using Dwolla/CampBX/BitcoinFog although it does require patience.<br /><br />To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
