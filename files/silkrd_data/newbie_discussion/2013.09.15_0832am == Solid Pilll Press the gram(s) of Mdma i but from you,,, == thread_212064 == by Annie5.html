				you know what would be the shit if these guys with the mdma by the gram , you could just but that and then have them pill press thos fuckers for you into anything you like,<br />that would be the damned shit!<br /><br />cause prices for candy have been so high i can t afford it, and if you could just but a gram with someone that knows how to use a pill press that would be TOTALLY LEGIT lol<br /><br />get at me if you have any info:))

				Not going to happen.<br /><br />The shape and imprints, designs etc... are made from punches &amp; dies in the press.&nbsp; They are made so that when the powder is pressed into it, it gets that shape and design.&nbsp; So you would need new engraved punches &amp; dies for each design or shape.&nbsp; And you mentioning that candy is too expensive for you now, this would only add to the cost.<br /><br />If you can afford grams, why not just use it that form?... why must they be pressed for you to use???
