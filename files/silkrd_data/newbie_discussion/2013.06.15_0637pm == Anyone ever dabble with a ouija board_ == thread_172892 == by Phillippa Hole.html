				I&#039;m going to a friends housewarming soon and been told that a ouija board will be getting pulled out. <br /><br />In 2 minds as to whether I should partake or just sit in the corner with a beer and joint and watch the others get messed up.<br /><br />Anyone have any experience with this stuff?

				Mmmmmm. You could have some fun here methinks.<br /><br />Why not spike the players with acid just before they commence? Leave it 10 minutes and tell them you feel a strange energy in the room.

				I agree SuperBeanFart, really think its just a load of bullshit. However, Dr Q, that might just be a good idea. In my head the whole episode will turn out like an episode of Family Guy, with hilarious results.<br /><br />Gonna look up a few good LSD vendors and prepare a housewarming that I for one, won&#039;t forget. Is this evil? Or just funny as?

				Trust me my friend I could write a book about ouija boards. And its totally your choice whether you do one or not.<br /><br />Years ago they were produced by Waddington games as a game for two people who were in love and wanted to contact the dead/ spirits. Anyway they eventually got banned as they caused a lot of trouble. The church was one of the main objectors<br /><br />Firstly these things do work and I have had many good and bad experiences with them. It all depends on which spirits you may get ( sounds corny I know but its true )<br /><br />I too was very sceptical about the whole thing at first and thought someone must be pushing the pointer around. Believe me it wasnt!!<br /><br />Anyway, too much to say here but my friend had to have his house exorcised after one eventfull evening.<br /><br />If you need to know more let me know. Cheers

				I only used it once and it&#039;s really about how much trust you have in the other person. When I used it I was freaked out, but it was years ago. The adrenaline of believing it was working, at that time, has worn off and now I second guess&nbsp; my boy who swore up and down he wasn&#039;t moving it. That night and a long time after I did believe though, but it&#039;s no longer fresh in my mind so I don&#039;t know

				Ouija boards are an interesting exercise in what our subconscious mind can do to screw with us.&nbsp; Years ago I saw a documentary about some scientists experimenting with one and their conclusion was that your subconscious can cause you to move the thing even though your conscious mind doesn&#039;t realize it.&nbsp; Pretty cool.<br /><br />Of course if spirits actually do exist and can communicate with it, it&#039;s the creepiest thing ever!&nbsp; Who knows?

				I&#039;m in two minds about them myself. I&#039;m Agnostic pretty much but believe in multiverses and consciousness etc, if you open up you mind to stuff things can happen, what that is exactly I cant quantify. When I was a teen I partook in it once and I didn&#039;t really like it I don&#039;t see the point in it. Fear is also a strong negative emotion that can be fed on by negative forces ( or our subconsciousness creates positive or negative outcomes?) . I wouldn&#039;t bother with it, I reckon you&#039;ll only find negative shit with those things. Meditation is where you can find more metaphysical insights IMHO. Yep, I believe them to be bad news fuck Ouija boards, who needs them! <br /><br /><br />Have fun and do as thoust will,<br /><br />M

I too use meditation and can vouch for its enlightening insights. As a physicist, my work takes me to the very edge of the physical world. (What lies beyond the strings of String Theory). This can have implications as at this physical level there is a tendency to bleed over into the non-physical. Herein lies the true mysteries of the Universe. A realm where it is indeed possible that the consciousness of the departed melt back into the grand universal consciousness from which all, including our own, consciousness derives.<br /><br />Of course, that is at present theoretical. It is controversial amongst not just physicists but across science. Many of us do think that there is something in the grand universal consciousness. This is what the lay person would call the spiritual world. Can energy or concentrated consciousness actually reveal itself as people in our physical universe? When a person dies, the body is dead. The brain has ceased to function. What of the consciousness that person had all their life? Does that die?<br /><br />I think not. The consciousness we have has intelligent beings never really belongs to us, it is lent to us from the grand consciousness for you to gather experiences to give back to the universal consciousness. There is no doubt that paranormal and supernatural phenomenon does exist. 95% is explainable, but the 5% we cannot apply logic to, that may well be the responsibility of &quot;something&quot; within the universal consciousness. <br /><br />I could be completely wrong about all of this. But it is fascinating to speculate using what we already know about the behaviour of sub atomic particles and waves.

				Yes I have used one, often with great success. <br />Once the glass shook for a while. Then later that night, while I was asleep, a spirit lady came to me, she gave me a massage- an ethical one that is all- then I suddenly popped out of my body and I saw her. She was young and died of a drug overdose. She got scared and went away. <br />I was buzzing with energy for about 3 days after wards. IT was a very intense experience. <br />Having said that, I at the time, had had 20 years experience in Ceremonial magick. I was at the time an adept and had only recently achieved illumination. I have had many such experiences. <br /><br />Yes sure go ahead, have a go at it. Don&#039;t be scared of the unkown. Nothing scared people more than the occult- except maybe aliens. It may very well be the real test.<br /><br />
