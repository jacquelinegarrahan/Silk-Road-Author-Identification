				I can answer your first question - Yes, he can still see the message, you only deleted it from your own sent folder, you can not delete a message from someone else&#039;s message box.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what happened with your pgp question, I am kind of confused by your question. please be more clear. but if he wrote a message to you using a pgp public key to which you dont have the matching private key, you wont be able to decrypt his message.<br /><br />QM<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=198505.msg1425601#msg1425601">Quote from: fredfirestone on August 08, 2013, 05:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1.<br />I send an massage to an vendor, after a view days it was unread marked i deleted it in my SENT folder<br />can he see the massage today or is the massage compl. deleted?

				LOL, let&#039;s be nice... although I would love if SR had a massage system, it would probably break a few laws of phyics, if not, all of them.
