				Have lined up some sample stock - do you guys feel .1 or .2 is best...but I have a limit of the total.<br /><br />Obviously I can do double the number of the .1 so can send to more potential clients...?<br /><br />Any thoughts on best strategy?<br /><br />Thank you kindly<br /><br />BB<br />x

				If it&#039;s a giveaway, then obviously people would prefer the bigger amount.<br /><br />You want people to be able to have enough to where they can actually sample the product, not just kinda sample.&nbsp; idk.<br /><br />Just make sure you pick people that will give you reviews, that will post it in the cocaine review threat etc.

				Yes i agree with above posts .2 so can properly sample its less reviews but only select people that have done reviews or have over 150 post&#039;s as seen venders say some sample receivers with low stats/posts don&#039;t even post anything,&amp; better doing sample by a link from SR so you get feedback Etc &amp; reviews<br />hope this helps

				I&#039;d choose to send out the 0.2 samples to half as many reviewers, but make your offer clear on the forums first and choose your own reliable reviewers. Putting up sample listings on a first come, first serve basis is a good way to lose money and get very little back. At least with reliable reviewers your product gets an honest review and is talked about on the forum. Good luck!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Everytime I get something to review, I prefer a smaller quantity. Do .1 samples, that way it stays a sample and not a free product. Those who want to review it wont care about the weight. They just want to try it out.<br />And by giving away .1 instead of .2 you can give out double the amount of samples to reviewers.<br /><br />Also by giving out a small amount of something you give the impression that its a good product and not random dirt which you shovel out in large amounts to people.

I, myself review by experience, look, taste and so on. And even if someone decides to test it before reviewing then they wouldnt need very much. 0.1 is fine I think. But then again Ive never done DMT so maybe testing with eztest or something is more spread out in the DMT community. But even I know that 0.1g DMT is much more what you need for testing and a single good dose.

				If it were DMT, I&#039;d say 0.1 would be fine... but coke, 0.2<br /><br />Imo... be selective either way you do it; you don&#039;t want just some crazy unintelligible junked out people writing reviews.&nbsp; Like fiend reviews are useless imo. <br /><br />Everyone likes getting free shit.&nbsp; Whether you&#039;re at a bar and get a free shot, or where ever.&nbsp; Makes them feel special etc., and shows people you&#039;re really not some cheap skate... to where in the future you&#039;d cut your shit down etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ya know what I mean?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen vendors just charge postage...

				Oh sorry I thought we were talking about DMT for reasons unknown.<br /><br />Ok for coke maybe around 0.2g sounds better. I agree with .2&nbsp; &lt;&lt;&lt; Ask for a lengthy review from each buyer of this.<br /><br />10 dollars is more than fair for such a sample + postage.<br /><br />Maybe 3 free samples for a contest. Thats always a great part of any good marketing strategy. &lt;&lt;&lt; this one isnt for reviews since you cant really expect any good review from someone who just wants free stuff.

				I agree with what deathowl is saying.&nbsp; .2 is definitely a fair sample size. In terms of price, $10 for .2 very fair, scaled up that&#039;d be $50/g.<br /><br />As much as I like free stuff, sending free stuff out for review is risky because the person gets their free stuff. Making them pay for it would hopefully make them more likely to post a review. Although with cola I&#039;m not sure why you wouldn&#039;t just look at it while at your computer, snort it, then write the review. <br /><br /><br />I think the contest would garner attention and possibly find people who would buy the product regardless of winning. It&#039;s all about advertising.<br /><br />Good luck with this. I&#039;d like to see how reviews go. I&#039;ve been planning to buy some cola from the road.

				can&#039;t say i&#039;ve ever had to pay for a sample in return for a review for a new seller. its the seller that is getting the real advantage as my review will generate interest and sales for them. most sellers see it as an investment really because its near impossible to sell as a new seller without any kind of feedback on the quality of the product, when there is so many other options from sellers with a long history and great feedback scores. that&#039;s what you are competing with on here i&#039;m afraid. i&#039;ve done about 5 or 6 reviews now for crack, weed, acid and smack, and not once was i ever charged for more than postage, if that.

				just thought i&#039;d point out, the only time you ever see a sample being charged for is by established sellers that just want to give new buyers a chance to sample their product before buying a larger amount. most restrict these to one per person and there is no review required. most also post that refunds are only available for bad quality product on samples. this enables them to prevent people buying larger amounts and trying to extort the money back by claiming the product was bad.

				for sure, i&#039;d probably send out about 5 if it was me and then set up my own review thread for them all to put the reviews in and so i could link potential customers to it on my vendor page.<br /><br />i&#039;d also avoid users with new forum accounts because if people notice them they will think you might have set up puppet accounts to review your own product, which then looks like the work of a scammer.

				to be honest if you sent a sample to me i would wash it up. that way i could tell for absolute certainty if the gear was good or not. so if you&#039;re not so confident then you&#039;d probably be best to send samples to someone else. i will only give an honest review of samples, otherwise i look a cunt when people buy it based on my review and it turns out to be crap. then my reviews aren&#039;t worth shit.
