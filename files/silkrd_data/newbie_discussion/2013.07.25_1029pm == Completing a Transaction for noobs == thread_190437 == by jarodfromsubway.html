				Can somebody explain the process of steps you go through when making a transaction on SR?<br />I think i got the jist of it except for a few things. When you want to buy an item it asks you for your address, so this is where you would encrypt a message to this person with their public key with your name and address with gpg4usb and include your public key in the message as well? Or do sellers prefer you email it to them instead? Also what is the best way to use escrow? I was gonna use btcrow but im not sure how to fill out the form. Example.. Does the buyer take responsibility for the escrow fee or do you split this 50/50 with the seller? It also asks for maximum shipping time and inspection period.. what do you put here. Is escrow truely necessary or can you just wait to finalize when you recieve your item?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow, OK, yes that is where you put your address either encrypted or not but better to do it. You can also put your key there as well. It&#039;s best to stay&nbsp; in escrow and finalizing after your receive your package. There is a commission for the sellers, but I don&#039;t think there is for buyers. The buyers can pay the fee or charge more for the product and pass it on the the buyer.

				Jarod,&nbsp; Sending your public encryption key to the vendor isn&#039;t necessary.&nbsp; The only time i would send it at all is if there was a dispute and you wanted the DCN(tracking) number from the vendor. <br /><br />Silkroad has a built in escrow service.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you can use an outside source for escrow.

				Silk road automatically escrows for you. After you place your order it will say &quot;In Process&quot; and when the seller ships it he changes the status to &quot;In Transit&quot; and you will also see a selection that says&nbsp; &quot;finalize and resolve&quot; when you receive your package you will log on to SR and press finalize. If you don&#039;t receive it,and you can&#039;t get any response from the seller you can have the resolution center get involved by pressing resolve.
