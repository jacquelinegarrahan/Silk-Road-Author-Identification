				I still don&#039;t understand why in the world people try to buy coins on here with MP. There&#039;s ten new threads a day crying, &quot;I got scammed!&quot;&nbsp; There are many other ways to buy BTC, and if you&#039;re worried about anonymity, you can run them through a mixer. You can also check for the &quot;taint&quot; of the original address that sent you coins on blockchain.info. You&#039;ll pay a premium anywhere, usually at least 7%, but it looks like you paid 100% this time. <br /><br />Anyway, be safe, and good luck.
