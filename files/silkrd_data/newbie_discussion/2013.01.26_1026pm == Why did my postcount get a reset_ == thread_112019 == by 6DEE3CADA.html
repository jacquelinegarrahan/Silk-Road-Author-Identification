As you are aware, recent spammers have posted in the forum and some were deleted today. Your retracted post count can possibly be attributed to this.

				I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />There are active thread in our newbie forum that are to increase post count.. I think its weak.<br /><br />I&#039;m dieing to get my count to 50, so I can post in the main thread so I&#039;m going to make a legitimate run at getting them.<br /><br />Perhaps your a culprit of the aforementioned thread?<br /><br />(I mean, I love the idea of a thread like that but.. ugh. Are posts counting?)

				Having threads just to spam to 50 seems pretty counter intuitive. The newbies who make it to the main boards will just be really good at spamming bullshit. Then again there are some pretty stupid and pointless threads in other sections of the boards too.

				Thanks guys, probably a thread got deleted which resulted in a reduced postcount. This new decisionmaking from the SR-forums crew is just ridiculous. Yesterday I received some testing results back from the lab so I just wanted to share them. Since I am only able to post in the newbie section I cannot post these results in the appropriate thread. This is really not a good collaboration motivator, so I will just read this forum and withhold any contribution. This is apparently what they want. Best regards.

				You guys making spam threads to reach 50pots are retards. Thinking you can spam your way to 50 posts to leave in a subforum directly activated to reduce spam is like pissing on a cops bike while he is arresting a man that you just watched piss on his bike.<br />Personally you are lucky in my opinion you didnt get banned and this just proves you have a lot to learn. The reason you got post deleted is you guys are pissing off the entire rest of the forum because they go to read the recent topic replied to and it&#039;s all you retards pointless spam so obviously admin/mods are gonna take care of the majority of the community not causing problems. You deserve to be here so you learn how to act proper in the forum and you might as well get the basics down now because you will be i a world of self inflicted flames for doing basic common sense problems in the rest of the forum.<br />I&#039;m sorry long time lurkers are stuck here as well but there is a easy way that wont gt your post deleted and out of here faster and posting int hose e threads is a cue to start your exit plan.<br />In the mean time anyone wanna perfect their PGP encryption a proactive way to gain several post in a productive thread?<br /><br />Anyone need a personal tutor because I know exactly how this place works.

				Post count doesn&#039;t mean anything. It isn&#039;t a measure for well behaving, knowledge, reputation, correctness, opinion, thrust or any other means of measurement which collaborates to the success of Silkroad-Forums. It simply is a measurement for how many posts a member has. People who correlate post count to any real life importance factor are the same people who measure manhood by dick size. It is a suboptimal solution for the spamming problem, since it affects the good people more than the bad. Goodbye.

Using suboptimal and most effective in one sentence. Accusing of being trivial while the real solution to the problem is the trivial one and the currently implemented one is the most crude one imaginable. Turning members into spammers.&nbsp; The world in its reverse. You would make up a great admin. By the way, I can see the forum and also many worthless posts by users who already have reached the 50 post threshold. Even if I had 50 posts and this 50 posts idiocy is still implemented, I would not bother contributing.
