				Hello. I&#039;m a noob and a technological luddite. <br />I remember reading somewhere that once you&#039;ve got your usb stick operating system you should not (?) access silk road with your same old account, or use the same ISP or something. And get a different wallet, right? I&#039;m going to install electrum bitcoin on the stick, which will involve making a new wallet anyhow, right? (not like i have any btc yet).<br />I&#039;m trying hard here to figure out how to do this...<br />What I understand so far:<br />I should only do anything on silk road on my tails stick...probably on a different computer than my usual one ?<br />I need to add extra encryption stuff...?<br />I got GPGtools, but I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t quite understand what pgp is and what it does, how to use it.<br />I have a vpn but I won&#039;t be using it anyhow, right? <br />btw, I don&#039;t pay for my ISP and my name is not attached to it in anyway, that&#039;s a plus.<br />Should I visit these forums on the same computer after I boot up from my usb? <br />This post is a mess of uneducated vomit.<br />help me!

				i just got tails running from usb. is all that stuff true? i should get a new wallet? i was going to send them from my other wallet which is encrypted in truecrypt hidden volume to a dummy blockchain wallet that i only use from a vpn or random ip address, and from there blockchain mixed send to SR on tails. not good enough? and should i set up a bridge to connect to tor to keep my ISP from knowing im connecting to tor entries?<br />&nbsp;i heard tails automatically leaves no trace of its use behind once youre finished. im using my tails usb on secondary laptop with a fresh harddrive, fully encrypted windows OS ...<br />as for pgp, i found the open pgp included works great. its a little more complicated than gpg4win, but i learned how to use it pretty quickly : copy a public key into a text doc, use openpgp to import the key (itll be in [other keys]), write a message in a text doc, file--&gt; encrypt --&gt; sign the imported key with your own (if you have made your own key pair yet) and youll be able to encrypt messages using whatever vendors public key. hope that helps...and sorry to add more questions to your post. im a tails n00b too!

				pertinent info for anyone trying to do this with a MBP:<br />intel-based Macbook pro&#039;s will NOT be able to boot from live usb stick.<br />I went as far as to boot from a dvd with rEFIt burned on it (with the tails stick plugged in). rEFIt recognized and displayed the usb stick as linux (I jumped up and gave the air a fist of success), I tried to boot from it and strangely my computer booted up my windows7 partition....(really killed my party)<br />HOWEVER, you can boot from tails dvd, and make a usbstick that way.<br />Macbook airs, on the other hand, and maybe chromebooks(although I don&#039;t know anything about built in security problems) may be able to boot from a usb stick.<br />Will test and post results in this thread eventually.
