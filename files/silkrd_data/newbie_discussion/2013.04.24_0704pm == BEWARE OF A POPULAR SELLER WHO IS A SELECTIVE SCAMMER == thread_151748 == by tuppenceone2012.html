				Right, now before any of you try and shoot me down in flames bear this in mind, i have had so many parcels of this guy it is uncanny, and never had one go wrong or missing, the seller CHIQUITA, one of the cheapest for pills on the road has scammed the cunt out me, used him many times constant orders great comm, as per usual with big orders he tells you to FE, and what happened to me this time round? all 4 parcels went walkies, sorry let me rephrase that he didn&#039;t even send them, how do i know this? Obviously i don&#039;t 100% know but put it this way i put another order in with a seller a week or so ago and it came in two days also from the same country so nothing has been stopped that&#039;s for sure, wonder if he will have the decency to return the 50% like he says or will he just happily bump me out of a nice amount of cash?! anyway guys please beware! also please try and avoid him because as low as his prices are it&#039;ll be your turn one day, maybe a couple of us should report him when the sites back up? i&#039;&#039;m not doing this to sabotage the seller either i did really like him until he made off with my hard earned :) anyway guys whats your experiences with this seller? pissed off 3 weeks today and Â£1300+ down fantastic lol back to the drawing board it is, ah well his packing was pretty jail bate anyway so guys, friends and fellow underground resistance lovers BEWARE CHIQUITA IS A SELECTIVE SCAMMING DICK HEAD.<br /><br />Also is he on the forums much? probably not because i&#039;ve seen he gets slandered a lot but there&#039;s a few people naive enough to big him up lol. so who&#039;s the next best price for 500+ disco biscuits????? around 200mg+ ??? Get back to me :)

				This is the thing with cheap vendors, they will make a fortune selling these drugs at a low price, realise they feel trusted with a lot of people, get them to make bulk orders, FE early and leave it at that. This is unfortunate, every thought about making a little less money but being able to guarantee your products will come?

				Man, this really sucks to see! Their page seems incredibly legitimate and their prices / quality are so extremely tempting. Definitely was getting my hopes up until I started poking around here on the forum. There is so many mixed reviews. I see quite a bit of them are from about a year ago...maybe a little less. However, this was in April...only 3 months ago. I am a USA customer and based on this it doesn&#039;t seem like it may be worth the risk. Has anyone bought from him recently and if so could you post about the experience? <br />SUCKS THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY MAKING A SHIT LOAD HAVE TO BE SO SHADY..... WTF IS UP WITH THAT!!! They should be happy being honest and making customers happy.... Much more rewarding. <br /><br />Looks like I may have to keep looking around... does anyone have any good suggestions?<br />PEACE&amp;LOVE<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;W.L.K&gt;&gt;&gt;

				I&#039;m sorry to hear bout you&#039;re loss.<br />i&#039;ve always liked the road because it removes the whole shady dealer aspect.<br />i know a couple of people who i would call big.it seems there either the nicest friendliest face,<br />or reclusive and&nbsp; cold.<br />even with the escrow system the bullshit still slips through.<br />bulk shouldn&#039;t request fe.if they do there should be a tracking number involved. <br />even then i think fe is bull shit.specially when someone&#039;s account&#039;s get to a year old or more.<br />

				Thanks for the heads up. That is a good thing about the forums. Folks can give you warnings about shady guys.<br /><br />I think it might be best to pay a little extra and use solid vendors. But there are some temping prices out there!

				I wouldn&#039;t take this thread at face value.<br />I have used Chiquita multiple times and a few of my friends have (We are all in the united states) and we never had a problem.<br />Not only that, but in the last month or so he has really stepped up his game so you should not fear a purchase from Chiquita.

				You wouldn&#039;t have anything to fear if you didn&#039;t FE. Especially on bigger orders...you&#039;re just taking a bigger risk, no matter how many times he&#039;s shipped stuff to you.

				Never FE. If you had ordered enough times from him there should be enough of a connection for him not to ask.
