				When you&#039;re scamming, you don&#039;t need a high response rate for it to be profitable.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my suggestion. It at least makes it a little more of a pain in the butt for the person to operate:<br /><br />Every time you see the spam, go to the site, and enter some bogus info to try to make a purchase. Then when it gets to the PayPal checkout, it will show the e-mail address of the person you are sending it to. Like bbbfunding at live dot com for example.<br /><br />Then safely make up an e-mail account somewhere and send a complaint to PayPal.<br /><br />With PayPal, you can&#039;t use it for &#039;currency exchanges or check cashing businesses&#039;. So send an email to PayPal at aupviolations at paypal dot com with the site URL and the e-mail address receiving the payments.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if it is working, but within a few days PayPal may cancel or block the person&#039;s paypal account. It might not set them back much but then they do have to create a new account, and possibly a verified account in order to get their money out fast enough.<br /><br />Somehow if the spammer gets the message that this type of thing is going to happen every time a spam message shows up here, maybe it will thwart the spamming.

				Spammers are the lowest of the low. Even if Bitswing offered a decent service, I wouldn&#039;t use them out of principle.

				Don&#039;t worry Paypal will be cancelling the account the new spam site is using to receive payments and likely blacklisting the domain so that it can&#039;t receive paypal payments at all. Yes he will simply move to a new domain but this makes it more of a pita for him. It&#039;s going to happen every damn time I see this spam in the forums.
