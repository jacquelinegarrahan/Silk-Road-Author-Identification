				Just wondering how many people have any of the RC&#039;s in their areas, specifically 25i and if so what is the street value there?

				The street price of 25-x depends on how ethical you are, and how savvy the buyer is. If you sell it honestly as what it is, and the buyer is hip to the fact that it costs less in bulk than toxic waste, then a couple bucks a blotter, maximum. Which is still very profitable, in volume. By asking this question you must be aware that 25-x are being sold as acid on the street at $10 a hit or more. Hard for many to resist a 2000%+ profit. I&#039;m not saying you would, and it&#039;s your deal how you conduct your business but for anyone considering this I would be careful. A lot of kids might not know the difference, and even those who do might have a great time anyway, but a lot of folks are now familiar with nbomes and hate the shit out of them. And will really resent the dishonesty. I&#039;m not knocking the N-bombs myself, I find them fun as hell, just wouldn&#039;t pay more than what&#039;s on SR.

If I had no access to psychs or was at a show and looking for something at the last minute I wouldn&#039;t resent paying 5 a hit. After all, 25i does get you fucked beyond belief, and still way cheaper than anything else at that price. <br /><br />Doubtwater: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe. Tons and tons of posts about nbomes on SR. People have very strong and divided opinions on the stuff, its very powerful and has strange, unexpected properties. For anyone wanting to try it, order a 5-10 strip and start small, like 1/2 tab first time, even if you&#039;ve done other hallucinogens. Since it is a relative of 2cb/mdma type RCs, it has some similarities to those effects, with the addition of visual and mental effects somewhat like tryptamines, just not as deep or profound. A major downside of 25-x drugs is the aftereffects can last for days, and even one decent trip can build a huge tolerance to other RCs/psychedelics that can last a week or more. I&#039;ve heard reports of SR users not being able to trip on legit LSD or DMT for a while after doing this stuff. I rarely hear of anyone having a &quot;bad&quot; trip, but lots of people seem to hate the stuff even when it is not terrifying. I guess LSD lovers find it shallow or something, if you like death trips this is not for you.

				Ok, thanks for the info. Need to do some research but I dont think itll be what im lookin for. I like good, solid, deep, trancendental cid adventures. Meditation n shit... sounds like it could be fun but not exactly the ride i want. What about all the commentary that it has a much higher acute toxicity and ld50 as compared to LSD-25, any thoughts? Thanks again!
