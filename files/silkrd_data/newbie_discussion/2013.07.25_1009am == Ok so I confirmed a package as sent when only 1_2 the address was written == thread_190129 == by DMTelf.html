				I stupidly confirmed an order that I thought was ready but when I arrived at the PO I realized that all I had written for the last line was &#039;columbria hall bloomsburg&#039; and nothing else, no state, no country (I presume USA or Canada?)<br /><br />Is there any conceivable way I can contact this person now? All I have is his real name from the letter, not his username on SR.

				Yes the order was done on SR, I have his SR username in the confirmed list somewhere ... just I don&#039;t know which one it is. I only know his real name from the envelope. I sent out 20 identical ones on the same day so I couldn&#039;t possibly guess which one it was either ...

				That&#039;s probably all you can do, just be honest and say you made a mistake and ask them to confirm their addys

				Consider your order lost. You need to refund the customer or ask for the complete address so you can reship. Its completely your fault and its wrong to charge the customer in anyway. In fact you should add some extra in the package because now the customer has to wait even longer for thier product.
