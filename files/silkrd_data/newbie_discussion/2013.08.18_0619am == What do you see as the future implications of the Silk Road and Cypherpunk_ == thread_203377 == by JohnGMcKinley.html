				When I first heard of the website, I sort of dismissed it.&nbsp; &quot;Well, ok, people are selling drugs on the internet, whatever.&quot;<br /><br />Then I read about the Dread Pirate and realized how big of a thing this is.&nbsp; This is amazing, I daresay revolutionary.<br /><br />The bulwark against a new age of informational panopticon of statist tyranny.&nbsp; <br /><br />This idea gives me hope, for the first time in a long time, real tangible hope about the development of a free society out from under the greedy eyes of those who would seek to compartmentalize our lives in order for us as good obedient tax cows on the hamster wheel of the fascist corporate state.<br /><br />Agorism, I kept hearing the idea talked about but never having a method to go about doing so.&nbsp; This is brilliant.<br /><br />The methods by which I had assume they would electronically enslave us in a few decades is the very method of their perpetual subversion!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know what you think.

				What&#039;s so funny about this is I really love weed but the whole having to find a dealer business really turned me away from it.<br /><br />The idea that you can have it delivered to your mailbox, is, quite simply, magnificent.<br /><br />Unimaginable.

				Who knows bud, hopefully the technology we base this community on will keep advancing (it surely will as tech is extremely rapid at evolving) and provide more freedoms and spawn great ideas. We are free here, we will stay here

				There&#039;s some hope, sure, but right now, unless things change, it&#039;s a quiet, shadowed hope. Hope for closets, anonymous back rooms, maybe dark apartments after everyone&#039;s removed their cell phone batteries and tossed everything in the refrigerator. Silk Road and its attendant technologies are absolutely positive developments, but I wonder for how long they&#039;ll continue to work (strong cryptography will get stronger and likely be around for a while, naturally---but side channel attacks are always a risk). There will be more monitoring: across the United States there will be a marked increase in public CCTV surveillance. New York&#039;s the laboratory, London (and elsewhere) the example. And something like the Chinese internet may be in our not-too-distant futures, who knows. I&#039;m rambling, headached, stringing together a fistful of half-formed thoughts. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to reside in East Germany, perpetually living out the dissident playwright&#039;s life in The Lives of Others, speaking honestly to a select few and even then not knowing whom to trust.

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s ever cause for total rejoicing or complete despair.&nbsp; <br /><br />Existence is such a beautifully messy business, which is why we like it so much.<br /><br />Technology being the double edged sword that it is, the only ones who get to win are the ones standing on the frontiers of it.<br /><br />

				7 billion of them scurrying around on the planet, I don&#039;t doubt it.&nbsp; In some form.<br /><br />We&#039;re too smart to be *completely* eradicated, except maybe by a &quot;planet cracking event&quot;, but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Even the worst magnitude of the larger asteroids would leave pockets of humanity in underground bunkers around the world, so I don&#039;t believe we need to worry about the extinction of the species just yet.<br /><br />I think we&#039;re just more disappointed than anything else.

				We might eradicate each other. One big nuclear suicide party is never out of the question, unfortunately. Unless things change. But who knows. I&#039;m interested enough in hanging back for however many years I&#039;ve got and keeping an eye on things to be too worried about all of this. Fascinating drama, life. (And maybe it&#039;s only when all drama is removed that we can evolve past violence.)
