				I wanted to give a excellent review for a new/up and coming vendor. SirThomasMore<br />sells FIRE #4 DOPE, XTC, PHARMS, I can&#039;t speak to products other than the Pharma&#039;s.<br />I came across his profile while looking for some hydromorphone, (diluadid) and did a bit<br />of digging to see what his rep was. After looking around a bit, and looking at his higher<br />than average buyer requirements, figured I&#039;d give him a try...<br /><br />I have to say after a few transactions, I have been more than satisfied with the products<br />and more importantly to me, the service. For me, I can&#039;t stand dealing with vendors that<br />don&#039;t reply, or take 3-4 days just to reply with a 2 word answer! For the prices products are<br />going for these days, I don&#039;t personally think its too much to reply in a timely manner, especially<br />when your new and trying to establish yourself in the SR community. The vendors I deal with <br />all take the extra time to process an order to my satisfaction. STM, took the time and effort to<br />answer a few questions, and gave a good comfort level. <br /><br />The products have been great, and the packaging were above par! He even went out of his way<br />to come up with some more product I was interested in that he sold out of earlier in the day!<br />Pricing is good, and larger orders even better!<br /><br />I hope he will expand his pharma offerings, and he&#039;ll be a one stop shop for what Im interested<br />in! <br /><br />I know I posted this in the noob section, but I have to get my post count a bit higher to post<br />with the big boys!!! LOL! If your looking for what he has, you will not be disappointed, with <br />him now shipping Priority, you can&#039;t go wrong! Communication is key, and for a vendor to keep you<br />in the loop as to whats going on, that&#039;s gold right there!!!<br /><br /><br />Keep up the great service STM!!!<br /><br /><br />Peace-
