				You know where it says &quot;orders&quot;....it was at &quot;1&quot; and when you clicked on it it showed my order.&nbsp; I did early finalization earlier today and when I came back not too long ago it says &quot;0&quot; orders and I click on it and there&#039;s nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is the order suppose to disappear from it?&nbsp; My money&#039;s still gone so I&#039;m pretty sure he didn&#039;t cancel my order or anything.&nbsp; But how am I suppose to edit the feedback once I receive the item now?<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem like this would be normal, I hope it is though.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Yes that&#039;s normal, its just confusing because the system is designed for you not to finalize until you receive your order. If you want to edit your feedback just click the green link on your home page that says something like profile then theres another green link that says edit feedback. If you just click around you will find it. Sorry SR isint loading atm so I can&#039;t tell you the exact buttons to click.

				This guy Lucydrop requires FE.&nbsp; He has like 99.7% feedback so I&#039;m taking my chances.&nbsp; It was the best deal by far I could find for what I was looking for for acid so I had to do it.<br /><br />But thanks guys I&#039;m glad this is normal, I thought my order got lost or something, I&#039;m a little paranoid I guess. Thanks.<br /><br />SR isn&#039;t loading for me still though but I&#039;ll figure it out :\

				Its strange for vendors with reship/refund policies to ask for fe because if something goes wrong and they get a resend/refund, that resend/refund doesnt go on their stats. As a whole I woukd have thought that wouldbe of concern to vendors knowing who exactly had a suspiciously high &quot;problem&quot; rate<br />I recently fe&#039;d for a vendor and the package didnt show. I asked for a reship which never arrived either. Im pretty sure he thought I was scamming him so he didnt post the second time but for $230 its not worth crying about after all iv no proof he didnt send it and at at least my stats are intact
