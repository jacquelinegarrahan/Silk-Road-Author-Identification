				Who doesn&#039;t feel comfortable getting things from states, specifically WA, since they&#039;re in the process of legalizing giggle twig?

				It depends where you are.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re from Canada and if so I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about it. Obviously security will be tighter than domestic but there are probably a million US-Canada packages going across the border every day. If you&#039;re in Europe or Asia then it gets a little more suspicious because the lower number of legit packages from the USA.<br /><br />Look at it this way, The Netherlands is the most famous place in the world for drugs and people get stuff delivered from there all the time even though they&#039;ll probably be scrutinised more than any package from where weed is legal.

				obviously i&#039;m brand new here so take with grain of salt, however my interest is in domestic only.&nbsp; i&#039;d never order anything requiring customs (too much risk).&nbsp; keep in mind, opinion based solely on an occassional customs / seizure in years past (none from here).&nbsp; nonetheless, whether losing money or worse, there has to be domestic sources for most wants...at least i hope!

Not only does it make prices higher, the market is also really limited and monopolized in certain drugs (For example, there are only 2-3 LSD sellers in OZ).

				I doubt it, I get mail from Seattle all time.&nbsp; I order stuff from amazon and 90% of the time it comes from California and they&#039;ve had medical mj for years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t think it matters because there is too much legit stuff going around.&nbsp; Besides everyone on here uses usps and for good reason, opening us mail is a federal crime so PO employees won&#039;t go snooping and reporting you, but they may &quot;loose&quot; your package.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even if an international item gets seized its not like they come after you, you get a letter saying you can come pick up your parcel and incriminate yourself or we&#039;ll just destroy it for you.

				I&#039;ve ordered from overseas a couple o times. I&#039;d rather stay domestic but once in&nbsp; while a product is available that is reportedly so superior that I have to chance it and give it a try. Smile Awhile&#039;s H for instance, and right now I&#039;m waiting on Bungee&#039;s lab tested crazily pure C. I&#039;ve always received my overseas orders.

				I had initial doubts about how safe it would be to get something in the mail, either by USPS or any of the other carriers. But, do you have any idea how many packages they process a day. It is impossible for them to search every package, they don&#039;t have the time for that. And as long as there is nothing that points you to the package they can scare you but can they get you? I mean, anyone could send a package to say Gil Kerlikowske, and if the package looked legit and he accepted it still does not mean that he ordered it. They would have to find something on your computer or something you use that links you. If you use the TOR package you are hidden, and if you store the directory for TOR on say a USB drive, and you use software to encrypt that drive...that information is safe.

				i feel very safe ordering from the US. i only order small personal amounts in letter mail. i think its as safe as domestic if the vendor is good and packs things properly. i think our countries are so close and friendly they arnt super strict like if it were coming from holland or columbia and other drug known countries. i never order from them, even from holland and they seem to have great products/prices. i&#039;m not worried of legal action, i just dont want my address getting flagged because i have nowhere else to order too. <br />but i think if the vendor is packing properly there is very little risk to canada from the states. i always ask international sellers there success rate to my country and most Americans say they have never lost a package

				I always order domestic when possible, but sometimes i just cant resist that deal from Netherlands and i go for it.<br />Theres a ton of other security precautions we all take so that we can afford to order from foreign places once and a while.<br />I do not think a specific state matters too much, a foreign country is a foreign country.<br /><br />lol @ &quot;giggle twig&quot; been smoking for years and never heard that one
