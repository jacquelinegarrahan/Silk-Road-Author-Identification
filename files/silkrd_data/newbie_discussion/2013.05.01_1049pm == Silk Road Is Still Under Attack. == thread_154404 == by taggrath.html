				I don&#039;t care who says what or who got on, I just tried to access the site with about probably at least 40 attempts to get in and still no luck. The site is NOT working.&nbsp; I hope DPR finds a permanent solution to this because it can&#039;t be reasonably used in this condition.

				I&#039;ve been in most of the day doing bits and pieces - So not a problem for me.<br />Seems to be running reasonably well, got kicked out a couple of times but got back in fairly easily.<br /><br />Hope you manage to get in yourself sometime soon.

				I wish I had your guys internet connection, but I know it&#039;s not my connection because I can access every deep web site out there, but silk road is always timing out for about alittle over two hours now. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s the login screen that isn&#039;t working because people who seem to have gotten on today are having no issues, but if you try to get on now, it won&#039;t work.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update if this changes. Hope I&#039;m not alone...

				I&#039;ve been using it for the past 18 hours or so 100% perfectly,&nbsp; but it looks like it just went down again in the past 15 minutes. hopefully it&#039;s just a normal hiccup.

				I have been in and out since yesterday with a few little hiccups but that&#039;s usual. Now I just have to wait for the vendour to pull his fuckin finger out and send my shit or else I&#039;m going to be held up another week and order elsewhere when I can cancel the order. It&#039;s like playing the waiting game in real life

				The site has been working for me throughout the day.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure its running well right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;re still having trouble you might be on a bad node somewhere along the line.&nbsp; Just hit &quot;New Identity&quot; in the control panel and it will generate a new connection.&nbsp; This will not appear as a new connection for stealth reasons, just a changed IP as I understand.
