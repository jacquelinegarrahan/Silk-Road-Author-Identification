				So I&#039;ve had an order in transit for a good seven days with empathy. Logged on today to see if other people were getting packages and lo and behold his vendor account is gone...I&#039;ve placed a ton of orders on the road and this is definitely a first. If the vendor account is gone I am guessing it&#039;s not just going to come back. Should I just email SR staff or wait the five days for resolve? <br /><br />Any one else order with him or know what the deal is? Sort of confused.<br />

				It appears he pulled a disappearing act. Even LuckyLucianno, his supplier, doesn&#039;t know where he went. I guess all anyone could do that has a pending order with him would cross their fingers for the order to arrive or go into resolution if it doesn&#039;t.

So I would give it some more time and try sending her/him a message, which you should be able to do still. I was able to click on seller from my transaction history and the message screen came up to send a message to empathy101. I think this is empathy&#039;s forum and she/he has current postings.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102596.15<br /><br />&nbsp;Hope your order arrives soon.

				No one should be worried about being ripped off.<br /><br />The slow and methodical method which with he got into vending would not be repaid with a small scam. I think he spent almost an entire 2 months just planning how he was gonna sell/sending out samples.<br /><br />Not sure where the feedback went though ... didnt know you could remove your feedback. Or does that happen in stealth mode ?<br />

				Thanks for the explanation.&nbsp; The steps you took sound reasonable to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I mentioned earlier my shipment arrived on-time as described, much appreciated. Also I was still able to finalize even though your account is in limbo.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />notcrazy1234<br /><br />
