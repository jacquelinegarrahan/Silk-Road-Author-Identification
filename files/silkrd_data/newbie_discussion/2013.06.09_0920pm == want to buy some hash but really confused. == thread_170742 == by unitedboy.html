				Hello, I&#039;m also in Ireland and I use mtgox to get coins. All you need is a bank account with online banking. Set up an account at mtgox, get it verified and transfer your desired amount to your mtgox account. Simples. You don&#039;t need to worry about it being anonymous as many say, buying bitcoins is perfectly legal.<br />Feel free to pm me if you have any questions

				There&#039;s a new company set up called Eircoin that I&#039;ve used twice to get Bitcoins from. All you have to do is lodge money into their account, either AIB or Ulsterbank and they&#039;ll transfer the coins to you Only took about an hour or two to get mine

				Here is the US, I use campbx.com. They accept USPS money orders which cost $1 and you can easily put down a fake name and address. Contrary to some, I think buying bitcoins should be done anonymously, especially when those coins are going to end up in your SR wallet. Even if you tumble the coins through a few random wallets, the coins USD to BTC creation can still be traced to your SR Wallet, so don&#039;t use legit address info when purchasing BTC for the SR, unless you use an online tumbiling services, such as bitcoin fog: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/, before moving BTC into your SR wallet.

				use Virwox, you add a credit card to your paypal, and then trade your &quot;USD&quot; or whatever currency you have and change it into &quot;lindens&quot; which is the VirWoX currency and then it will give you an option to change your Lindens into &quot;BTC&quot; AKA bitcoins, thats how i&#039;ve always done it and it works for me every time, theres a max 70$ per order limit so if your item is like 90$ you have to buy 70$ and then make another 20$ payment, good luck<br /><br /><br />link to VirWoX, watch out for VIRWEX! virWEX is a scam site, VIRWOX is legit <br /><br />https://www.virwox.com/?drgn=1

				bitcoins should be bought anonymously to prevent LE from tracing those coins back to you.<br /><br />localbitcoins.com<br /><br />i think they have european vendors
