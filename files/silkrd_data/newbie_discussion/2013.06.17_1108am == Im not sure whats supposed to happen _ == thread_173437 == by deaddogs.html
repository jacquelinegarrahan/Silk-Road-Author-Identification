				hmm, but i thought he wanted new people to FE , but wouldn&#039;t that be before he ships ? else whats the point in FE. If someone was going to try and rip him off they would just order , he would ship and then expect the buyer to finalize but to late by then ?

				think you missed the point of my question.<br /><br />I can&#039;t FE yet, but i was asking how FE protects the vendor from getting ripped off if he has to ship first before the buyer can FE

				Putting a check mark in &quot;yes I have sent this item&quot; is easy for a vendor, noone can verify that it is actually on its way. So the vendor just marks the item as &quot;sent&quot;, but will only send it for real if you finalize.

				hmm, odd<br /><br />Obviously they can do that but a whole load of the vendors ask new people and/or large quantities to FE or they wont deal and these are reputable vendors. If they are just &quot;saying&quot; they have dispatched when they have not and doing it quite openly what does SR have to say about this ?<br /><br />I mean they are in good standing with good feedback coming in every hour almost , 50% of whom have FE&#039;ed but SR is quite happy with them clicking dispatched when they haven&#039;t <br /><br />Not really that worried , just curious

				I think until the vendor marks it in transit, you cannot FE. Partially that is probably because the vendor may decide not to accept the order at all. If it&#039;s a decent vendor, good reputation, etc., I wouldn&#039;t hestitate to FE if asked to do so, but granted, yes it is more risk for the buyer that way.
