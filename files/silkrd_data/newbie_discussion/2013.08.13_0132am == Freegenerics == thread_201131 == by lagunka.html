				<br />So I ordered what was supposed to be 100 x generic Indian produced 30mg oxycodone hcl. I received a fake/incorrect tracking number from him after which he stopped responding to my messages. I received the package with the product still in blister packs. On them it said they were manufactured in New Jersey and distributed out of Michigan and were labeled Oxycodone hcl 30mg. When i removed them from the pack they were white oval pills with a dash and no other markings. I broke some off and it tasted like oxycodone but only slightly and the pill was rather large. I am by no means a regular opiate user and I only felt slightly buzzed and then totally sober about 3 hours after ingesting 1 pill. I usually only take 15 mg of percocet at a time so a full 30 mg should really get me buzzed. Are they fake? If so how were they in a US made blister pack with a bar code and legitimate pharmaceutical company names and why were they not marked? Or are generics just considerably less strong then name brands? The whole situation is bugging me and I&#039;m not sure what to make of it.<br />

				I seen these when he first listed them they were only like 2 bitcoins at first, a few days later he raised the price to 5 bitcoins.. Very suspect. I messaged him asking for more information about these pills, i cannot find them anywhere on the internet for the life of me. My gut definitely tells me its a scam. And there no reason the pills should be that fucking big.<br /><br />Edit- I forgot to mention when i messaged the vender questioning these he gave me a complete nonsense answer and said everything i need to know about them is in the description.. the description doesnt say anything of value.

				yeah i asked if they were extended release before I ordered and he just ignored the question and said &quot;from good indian company don&#039;t worry.&quot; I figured fuck it it was only $100 and I guess the pharmacy on the blister packs was shutdown for inconsistent products for a while and even though it&#039;s in a legit blister pack nothing comes up when I search it.

				Sorry to bring this old topic back up, just wanted to let you know the same thing happened to me. I ordered 200 30mg oxys and got what appears to be chalk. I did feel a very slight buzz so there may be just a little oxy in there, who knows. I intend on purchasing a reagent test and testing one of the pills to be sure.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update or make a thread when I do so.
