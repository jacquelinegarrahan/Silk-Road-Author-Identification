				I don&#039;t see how using a PO Box would be worth the trouble.&nbsp; In some guides here, i see recommendations to use one to minimize risk, then qualifications that seem to take all of the value out of the effort.<br /><br />The main thing is, somebody has to be associated with the PO Box.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t want to expose myself to the risk of that association, I surely don&#039;t want to ask a friend or associate and make them a potential fall-guy.&nbsp; I&#039;d be ok with enemies taking that risk, but I just don&#039;t think they would cooperate.&nbsp; Look what Tom, a PO Box biz owner, says at http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101117201356AAQ1B72 (clearnet):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if law enforcement or a governing body requests the information on the boxholder with a subpoena then we are required by law to hand over that info. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that illicit packages are less likely to be snooped when they are in a mail box on (or within a few feet of) my property rather than in a post office or a Mailbox Plus (perhaps staffed by bored teenagers).<br /><br />Third party services like https://www.privatebox.co.nz/ just increase exposure for physical packages.&nbsp; Besides raising suspicion due to extra forwarding, you are increasing the amount of time in the transportation system and maybe doubling the number of hands that will touch it... never mind adding days to your delivery time.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m missing something.&nbsp; Can anybody support the benefit of getting a PO box for SR usage?

				I think using a fake ID that is actually linked to someone that actually exists, with your picture on it will keep you in the clear. Maybe use a tormail address to check on your UPS delivery and someone not in the know-how picking up said package. Maybe put box in a business name too. Think about it and weigh the facts. NEVER SIGN FOR ANYTHING! And I mean NOTHING!!!!!!

				I use a PO box. I only use it because I still live with my parents and I don&#039;t want them snooping around my letters and getting mixed up in this SR business. I&#039;ve followed the rules of not signing for anything and don&#039;t open any packages until you&#039;re somewhere safe, and it&#039;s been going well.

				It&#039;s dangerous no matter how you look at it. By setting up a box you can add a level of security if you do it right, don&#039;t use your real ID, don&#039;t park in front or near surveillance,&nbsp; know the area, where all cameras are at, there are so many factors.

				I myself am considering setting up an PO box and have many of the same concerns. I don&#039;t know how it works where you live but here (Ireland) you have to show two photo id&#039;s and a utility bill or bank statement with your name and address on it to set one up, so fake id&#039;s not really an option..

				I don&#039;t recommend a PO box. Like others said, it&#039;s just more hands to go through, and it&#039;s weird to get mail in a PO box when you have a permanent address. A PO box is probably better for someone running a home business who doesn&#039;t want to give out their address to customers. That&#039;s just my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to BE WARNED about: Using a fake ID to get a PO box is a federal crime.

				I agree that a PO box is not a good idea...but one option I have used in the past is &quot;virtual offices&quot;...just find one in your area....the one I used did not require an ID (fake name) and it had 24 hour access so I could pick up my mail anytime......there are virtual offices located all over the world....thank me later

				Ordering drugs through the postal system/international drug trafficking is a crime too unfortunately. I still think PO boxes are much safer with fake docs is the best way to go for me as I receive a large amount of orders on a weekly basis. In my case, I&#039;m fortunate enough to have some guys I pay to open the boxes for me using false docs. <br /><br />I doubt more scrutiny is placed on PMB&#039;s than residential addresses, they are looking for suspicious packages not addresses. If you are afraid of using false documentation, just open it in your name, and start receiving mail there in your name such as catalogs, and other junk. That&#039;s my opinion. I used to order packages to my house, or friends/family but I started becoming a lot more careful.

				What about this:<br /><br />Many of us get letters posted for the previous tenants who lived at the address. <br />Why not take their real name, and your current address where they were living and where you now live and when buying on SR, just put their name and your current address? <br /><br />If the vendor posts a letter/package that needs no signing, the postman drops it off into your mail box, you pick it up, do the RTS, leave for a few days and that is all. <br /><br />If LE has any problems, &quot;fuck thats not even for me officer&quot;. <br /><br />If it goes go to the post office then this becomes complicated as you have to physically sign for that package &quot;on behalf of them&quot; because you share the same address according to your driver&#039;s licence etc.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				The idea of using the previous tenants name is a good one, only I&#039;d be worried about the post office forwarding the mail. There is a certain time frame which they are supposed to forwad mail for I believe it&#039;s 3 months or something, and then they are supposed to stop. Well, I&#039;ve found that&#039;s not always the case. It depends on the mail carrier, every post office has different staff. I&#039;ve had packages that were legitimately sent to me forwarded to the previous tenant because the mail carrier was a retard.
