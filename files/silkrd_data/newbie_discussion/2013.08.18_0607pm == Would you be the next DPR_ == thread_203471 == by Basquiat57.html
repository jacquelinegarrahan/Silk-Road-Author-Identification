				Talk about being a leader.<br />DPR is an amazing character and probably one of the most capable persons behind a computer. He is knowledgable and understanding, this guy was meant to run this place. He knows the power he has and great ways to use it!<br /><br />It would be a great honor to have such an oppertunity, but the responsibility would be too great. You need an extensive knowledge of computers and networking

				I&#039;d say it&#039;s hard to be caught when you&#039;re always in motion...Given the network available of underground criminal-minded folks, and the resources available to someone of that magnitude of importance(Welcome to the age of digital ganstas! It&#039;s good to be the queen...)&nbsp; then someone with no family who has successfully switched her identity numerous times could maintain a global network of &quot;those who the rest of the world wish non-existent.&quot;&nbsp; Paranoia is only a beneficial evolutionary response for those who have something to lose...<br /><br />So I&#039;d take the job in a heartbeat.

				I couldn&#039;t handle it. I&#039;d be too paranoid to leave the house or do anything. Imagine having one of, if not, the biggest drug distribution operation in the world? Your decisions would affect millions of people!

When SR becomes a world phenomenon, I think DPR will get so much more fulfillment out of it, and much money to blow of course LOL!
