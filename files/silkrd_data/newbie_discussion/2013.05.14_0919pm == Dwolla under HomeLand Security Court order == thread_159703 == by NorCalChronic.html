				I got this email this morning:<br /><br /><br />As of 12:13 PM on 5/14/2013: <br /><br />You’re receiving this notice because our systems have indicated that you’ve processed and completed a real-time Dwolla-to-Dwolla payment to Mutum Sigillum LLC (“Mt. Gox”) within the last 24 hours. <br /><br />Due to recent court orders received from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Dwolla is no longer legally able to service Mutum Sigillum LLC’s account. <br /><br />This is a courtesy email encouraging you to follow up on any uncompleted orders with Mutum Sigillum LLC as Dwolla is now unable to move money to and from Mutum Sigillum LLC’s Dwolla account. <br /><br />Dwolla is not party to this matter nor does it have any information or further insight into the situation. We strongly encourages those with questions to contact Mutum Sigillum LLC <br /><br />Note: Dwolla requires a court order before honoring requests such as seizing funds or revoking access to an account. <br /><br />On behalf of Dwolla, we apologize for this inconvenience.<br /><br />Does anybody have any insight to what this may lead to??

Expect dollar-based transactions in bitcoin to get increasingly difficult with each new round of government intervention.

				BTC has been getting an awful lot of media attention lately.&nbsp; I am surprised the Feds haven&#039;t intervened in this manner before if this is true (under the guise of homeland security breach, money laundering, tax evasion, etc.).&nbsp; It is going to get more and more difficult to buy btc.
