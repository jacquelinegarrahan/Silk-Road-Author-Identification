				I consider myself pretty web savvy but only recently started to discover this particular &quot;corner&quot; of the web.<br /><br />I have quite a bit of experience using LSD in my youth, and it was always my absolute favorite substance to indulge in. As the years passed and I got a little older, lost contacts, it became nearly impossible to find. A few years back I managed to find a guy on a message board that actually sent me some after I sent him the cash. I knew I was taking a risk but he came through and I was certainly thankful and enjoyed every hit I received.<br /><br />Then I lost his email address and have not had any since.<br /><br />Recently I discovered Silk Road and am amazed at how simple it is to get whatever you need with very little risk.<br /><br />I now have some lucy on her way to see me and I am like a giddy little school girl just&nbsp; anticipating her arrival.

				I felt the exact fucking same as you when I discovered this websites. No longer have to rely on sketchy yobs in hoodies to sell me a totally unreliable product.

				Yup, its ace! Plenty of ways to get drugs on the surface net but its much more reliable from SR, just be prepared for the unbearable anticipation peaking daily when the postman comes, and the crushing disappointment when he doesnt bring your package..until that one fateful morning when all your dreams come true :), its like being a kid at christmas
