				Hello all,<br />So I have some questions for anyone who&#039;d like to contribute.&nbsp; I am most definitely interested in what everyone who likes pain killers thinks and also would appreciate anyone that is able to answer my questions and give some good feedback.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, I have a couple of questions regarding Norco&#039;s and Oxycontin.&nbsp; Obviously Oxycontin is the strongest or one of the strongest pain killers and I&#039;m curious to find out more about them from anyone that has experience taking both.<br /><br />The whole reason I spent a month figuring out how to get on SR and use it was to obtain Oxycontin. <br />I have been taking 10mg Norcos for quite a while. I have major anxiety and was prescribed Valium for it, but that was not enough.&nbsp; But...once I discovered Vicodin, that did the trick.&nbsp; At first, I just enjoyed the great effects you get by taking it, but it has actually proven to cure my anxiety.&nbsp; When I take it, it completely focuses me, I do better at work, I have tons of energy and I sleep great. I take it more for those reasons than I do just to get high.&nbsp; I have been taking 30mg of Valium and 130-150mg of Norcos, it&#039;s the perfect amount to fix my extreme anxiety.&nbsp; I have lately though been noticing that my tolerance has obviously been going up and I can feel some of my anxieties creep back.&nbsp; So, rather than up the amount of Norcos, I thought I would try something different, stronger-which brings me to Oxycontin.&nbsp; I was curious if it would give me that same great feeling I got when I first took Norcos and also stop my anxiety, plus I would get to take less pills.<br /><br />So, my questions are, what is the biggest differences between the two? What is a comparable amount of the 80mg Oxycontin in relation to the 130-150mg Norcos? Or, how much stronger is 1 80mg oxy compared to 1 10mg norco?<br /><br />This morning I took Oxy for the first time.&nbsp; I ate a small breakfast (just like I do before I take Norcos) then took 1 80mg Oxycontin with my Valium and I felt nothing at all after 45 minutes, so I took one more-and then I felt a little of the effects that I&#039;m use to when I take Norcos, but only very little. So, did I not take enough Oxy?...Or did I not take it the proper way? I always let the Norcos just time release but I&#039;ve heard you can crush some Oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; I know that you supposedly cannot crush these 80mg Oxy&#039;s, but if you could, would that be better?...<br />I expected to feel amazing and it was a big let down, were my expectations of taking Oxycontin blown out of proportion?&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing that really happened was this afternoon when I started to get tired and had a cup of coffee, then I felt some effects, but nothing like the euphoric feeling, focus and loss of anxiety I get with taking Norcos.<br /><br />So, with all the being said, does anyone have any thoughts? Suggestions on what I should do differently?<br />I really thought that taking the Oxy&#039;s would be amazing and like 10 time better than the Norcos, but I didn&#039;t experience that at all. So...<br />Anyone who has any advice, tips and info of any kind would be very much appreciated!<br />Thank you

				If you&#039;re taking 3 or 4 Norco&#039;s at a time I imagine&nbsp; the rush you feel when 40 mg of hydro finally hits you is going to come on a lot stronger than whatever the time released dose of oxy you get in the same time period.<br />Perhaps a different form of Oxycodone, besides the time released OC&#039;s will get you were you need to be. Though in my experience, you&#039;re going to have the same tolerance issues in no time at all.<br />A potentiator (like Tagamet or grapefruit juice) and taking the meds on an empty stomach may also help you get the most out of your dosage, without actually taking more pills. <br /><br />Personally I&#039;d be concerned with the large amount of Acetaminophen I was consuming with all those Norco&#039;s and find a cleaner version (or new drug) on that basis alone.

				You can chew the time release OC&#039;s. Cut it in half and then in quarter with a pill cutter then chew. The consistency is something like a hard marshmallow (and is kinda bitter). It wont be perfect immediate release but it will be close. <br /><br />As for finding out how much you should take Google &quot;opiate conversion calculator&quot;. They can be useful tools in getting a rough estimate on how much you should take.<br /><br />Also careful with the mixing of opiate and benzo. It will suppress your breathing when you sleep and can cause problems. Especially when you drink.

				Yes listen to Stembolt. The OP oxycodone pills really do suck my friend.&nbsp; i do not believe the dosages are correct when compared to taking the old formulation.&nbsp; I used to eat the old 80&#039;s and was higher and more blown away from longer.&nbsp; The OP formulation is pure garbage if you ask me.&nbsp; Try Roxies, they are a great way to still get the IR hit that oxy gives you when you snort it.&nbsp; i believe Oxycodone when compared to morphine is 1.5 times stronger.&nbsp; Hydrocodone is 1 or equal strength

				Whatever you do, DO NOT buy the Vicodin or Hydrocodones on SR. It&#039;s a fucking waste of money. An oxycodone/roxicodone of the same price as MG lasted me all day, and these fucking Vike&#039;s lasted 1 hour and I barely even felt anything after around 30 minutes. It&#039;s a waste of money.<br /><br />So buy either Oxycodone, Roxicodone, or Oxycontin like you said. Stay away from the Hydro&#039;s/Vicodin&#039;s they are a waste of money.<br /><br />x3 Vicodin ($27) = 1 hour high with a peak of like 15 minutes<br /><br />x1 Oxycodone/Roxi ($28) = 8+ hour high with a peak lasting 3+ hours<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m so fucking pissed right now.

				Oxycontin is nowhere near being one of the strongest painrelievers.<br /><br />It is the controlled release formulation as oxycodone, which is only slightly stronger than Norco&#039;s (which ar hydrocodone).<br /><br />Oxycontin is only much stronger than Norco&#039;s because it&#039;s a higher dosage of oxycodone.<br /><br />And if your debating Roxy&#039;s over OP Oxycontin, go with the Roxy&#039;s (assuming that both are 30 mg). It&#039;s lest hassle since Roxy&#039;s are instant release. Don&#039;t go for OP&#039;s unless they&#039; at least 40&#039;s. It&#039;s really hard to break the time release with the OP formulation of oxycontin, so you need it to be a high dose for the same effect.<br /><br /><br />And whoever charged you $27 for 3 Vicodin raped you
