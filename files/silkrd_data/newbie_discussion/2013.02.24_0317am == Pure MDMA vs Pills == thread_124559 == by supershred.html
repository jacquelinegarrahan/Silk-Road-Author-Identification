				Sorry if this is the wrong forum but figured it&#039;d be the best for others to give feedback :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever tried ecstasy in pill form (was the goods, after reading reviews of the same one others figured it contained 100-120mg MDMA per pill) and I slept beautifully afterwards unlike 1 I&#039;d tried previously which kept me up. All in all my question is what would be the difference between taking a capsule you&#039;ve measured yourself containing 100mg MDMA (pure, ~%85) and taking&nbsp; a tablet containing a proven ~100mg per pill? Would the MDMA capsule always be the better option?<br /><br />Thanks! :D

				Mdma crystals or powder is so much better than pressed pills imo. <br />You can measure out a light dose and go from there with small boosters. You just need a $20-30 digital scale, If it is from a trusted source, then you atleast know what is in it as well. Pressed pills have god knows what in them.&nbsp; There are so many good mdma vendors on here. <br />Good luck!!

				Ah, I&#039;ve always experienced MDMA the other way round. I&#039;ve only ever had bombs of pure crystals ground to powder. I&#039;ve always felt slightly distrustful of pills that get sold at festivals/raves, just because of the mystery of what they&#039;ll be cut with. Saying that, I&#039;ve had friends purchase pills before and have a great time. <br /><br />As a matter of personal preference, MDMA crystals/powder is a fantastic high and I don&#039;t see the need to go with anything else. I would be more inclined, however, to give pills a go now that I&#039;m on SR, as I feel I can trust what I&#039;m getting (or at least more so than on the street). The &#039;Candy King&#039; capsules I&#039;ve seen about look quite tempting - MDMA and K combination that sounds like a great roll.

				Thanks for the replies guys! I was thinking the same thing - plus I&#039;ll be capping myself from a trusted seller on SR so can&#039;t go wrong if I&#039;m measuring them right :) <br /><br />@nacho - It isn&#039;t the same, the pills may contain ~100mg of MDMA but they also contain fillers and there is no way of knowing what exact fillers are used. There could be fillers to try and prolong a high like amphetamine but I&#039;d much rather pop another capsule of crystal MDMA than taking in amphs.

				For XTC always visit (clearwebalert) pillreports.com there&#039;s so much useful information there. If you really want to ensure your mandy is on point, get some marquis reagent to test it, it&#039;s quick and easy to do, and works for XTC and crystal. Taking a few pre-roll seconds to conduct a simple test can make all the difference to your night (or day!). Happy and safe rolling everyone :)

				I used to have a problem finding pressed pills with MDMA as the only active ingredient locally, and seemed to have better luck with the crystal. SR has opened my eyes to lots of these tablets, but it seems more expensive per dose than crystal so I just stick with that. I did have a great experience on only half a pill from emonkey.

				Just a couple thoughts, interested if I am off base here:<br /><br />Crystallized MDMA (Moon Rocks, Shards etc) contain 15-16% of something to get it into crystal form.&nbsp; You commonly see 84% pure MDMA as the norm advertised.&nbsp; This means that 100mg of crystals will get you 84mg of active MDMA.&nbsp; My understanding is that pills tested in the lab will report back with the amount of active MDMA.&nbsp; So if ecstasydata dot org says it has 100mg of MDMA, this is 100mg of active MDMA, a decent amount more than the 84 from the crystal.<br /><br />Also, my understanding of presses is that it helps space out the release of the MDMA into your system, so the new Partyflocks at 200mg MDMA and tested to contain nothing but MDMA, will be like taking 238mg of crystal over a couple hour period depending on the density of the press.<br /><br />In any event if you buy yourself a good pack of a particular press, you can send one in to ecstasydata dot org and get it tested for a pretty cheap price, around $20 last time I checked.&nbsp; Not bad....&nbsp; <br /><br />blahblah1234

				About 4-5 years ago I was doing pills every weekend or two for about 12 months. I found that pills gave me more of a rush than pure MDMA crystal that I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that a lot of ecstasy pills are pressed with speed and/or caffeine. I have a music festival coming up and will be testing 75mg mdma/25mg speed caps -- looking very forward to it!<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t forget that a lot of people (including myself) drink alcohol at the same time as doing pills so that can effect the results. I know when I&#039;ve done pure MDMA, I didn&#039;t drink (anywhere near as much) alcohol, but when doing pills I would be going out to get drunk/fucked up.<br /><br />What do I prefer? Well, I can&#039;t tell you until I try the speed/mdma combo this coming weekend!

				My clientele find the pressed pills to be more enjoyable. As a seller of MDMA products, this frustrates me because MDMA is far more easier to ship than pressed pills. Also there are better deals to be had on the mandy itself, if I&#039;m not mistaken. My thoughts on the pills being better amount to the fact that the hard pills metabolize slower, therefore last longer and take longer to absorb. Rather than, a capsule of molly which possibly gets absorbed in a shorter overall time.<br /><br />What I cannot explain though, is that even the pressed pills on SR that have been labratory tested to contain only MDMA, somehow cause my friends to have a more energized roll, compared to the molly in capsules.<br /><br />Again this frustrates me because honestly I enjoy both, but one sells better than the other.

				I am also interested in this topic. I did pills some years ago for some time.&nbsp; Crystal molly only once during holidays (combined with charlie) so I am not that experienced.<br /><br />What I can say for sure is the pills effect shows up in &quot;rushes&quot; or &quot;waves&quot;. The crystal was more smooth and I did not experience these &quot;waves&quot;. However this might also be related on being with Charlie at the same time but from what I read in this thread others seem to share the same experience.<br /><br />So when substance is the same but effects are different this surely has something to do with the form (pressed vs. loose). Can also imaging that the pressed form delivers substance over longer period of time since stomach has to break it down first before coming to bloodstream.<br /><br />However should the loose form of crystal not lead into one &quot;big rush&quot; since all substance is processed at once (stomach does not have to break it down first?)<br />

				Could the pills be preferred for the confidence factor as well?&nbsp; no muss no fuss just down the hatch and you&#039;re off. <br /><br /><br />Also have only ever done pills because that&#039;s what I had access to and quite frankly not sure what to do with the crystal?&nbsp; I know I could do the research but since this is a MDMA thread.&nbsp; How do you use the Crystal and what dose?

If anyone is considering capping their mandy for the first time, I recommend you get a small funnel (I find it a lot less fiddly), weigh the cap first, then zero the scale, add the mdma, and reweigh, you get a very accurate dose this way :)

				So will 200mg MDMA in a capsule always be much better than a 100-150mg pressed pill?

				If you know whats in the pill, then mdma is mdma. The issue that comes up is alot of time not knowing whats in the pill. I never saw powder for a long time and when I started using LA was in a golden era where most of the pills were bomb. But since then I&#039;ve had a few shitty pills. If your source is good and you know whats in the pill, there is no difference. Good luck with that though depending on where you are.

As a seller of MDMA products, this frustrates me because MDMA is far more easier to ship than pressed pills. Also there are better deals to be had on the mandy itself, if I&#039;m not mistaken. My thoughts on the pills being better amount to the fact that the hard pills metabolize slower, therefore last longer and take longer to absorb. Rather than, a capsule of molly which possibly gets absorbed in a shorter overall time.<br /><br />What I cannot explain though, is that even the pressed pills on SR that have been labratory tested to contain only MDMA, somehow cause my friends to have a more energized roll, compared to the molly in capsules.<br /><br />Again this frustrates me because honestly I enjoy both, but one sells better than the other.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Proper MDMA or MDA pills add some caffeine to boost the uptake. The MDxx (never mdma) pills I get these days are cut with Meth instead.so no sleep till the night of the next day for me.

				I&#039;m talking about ~85% pure MDMA crystals cut up, measured out to 200-250mg and taken via capsule as opposed to a tablet (Australian grade). Will the capsule with 200-250mg of MDMA only always trump a pressed pill?

				So if you get the big rocks and want to put them in a capsule, what&#039;s the best way to crush it down? Especially if you wanted to do it on a mass scale?

What do you guys think would be the best ratio? I know, it&#039;s more neurotoxic but I don&#039;t want to be smacked the fuck around by the amazing molly, I want a bit of energy so I&#039;m thinking 100mg MDMA and 20-25mg of speed? I&#039;m going to a music festival and will be dropping at around midday, and will drop again at around 3pm or 4pm I think. What happens after that really depends on how I&#039;m travelling! Any advice/feedback is appreciated :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That sounds sensible enough. A few of my friends have a similar routine and manage 8 hours through the night that way. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like feeling too amped up so thus far in my druggy routine I just stick with the mdma. I notice more of its amphetamine effects when I surpass 120mg. So if I want more intensity I go to about 140mg. This is what I like about getting pure instead of pills, I can really tailor my dosing to what I want. <br /><br />If you want to extend your peak of MDMA I would take *half* your initial dose 90 minutes after you&#039;ve taken your first. It intensifies it a little but definitely makes it last longer. I think it&#039;s better than starting to come down and having to take a full dose again.&nbsp; If I&#039;m out all night I take 120mg, 90 minutes later 60mg, 2-3 hours after that 100mg. Then I tend to switch to a sativa dominant weed, which brings back a lot of the high, particularly in body. Occasionally I&#039;ll drop another 100mg but I notice significant cognitive impairment if I do that. Maybe one day I&#039;ll go the speed bump route instead.
