				Make sure you send a message to SR support so that when they do fix the issue, they know whose accounts have been affected.

				geez scurry.. if you deposited legitamite bitcoins and they didnt show up just gather all the info like transaction number etc and send it to sr support. Its possible that if this has happened to others that they are flooded with messages and may take a while to respond to you! Just give it time if you sent sr a message and if they dont respond in a week send another. Ive had sr respond to my messages every time i send one but it takes time! Accidents happen and they will fix it if you really did send them btc.
