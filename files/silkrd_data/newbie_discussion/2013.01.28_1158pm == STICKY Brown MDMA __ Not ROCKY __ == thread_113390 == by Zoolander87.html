				Hey guys!<br /><br />Just a quick question for u MDMA experts! :) <br />I just bought some MDMA of my favorite vendor. Thing is that this batch is brown and REALLY sticky. <br />In the past i always had rocky MDMA. This one was already crushed when it arrived.<br /><br />The smell is really awfull also and like I said really sticky. Far from nothing i&#039;ve seen so far.<br />So what do u guys think. Should it be any good and do u guys ever had sticky mdma?<br />Maybe i&#039;d also buy some testers. Any advice on that ?<br /><br />Tnx again for the feedback guys!&nbsp; :)<br />

				Reagent test it. Marquis and Mecke are good first line reagents to detect the presence of MDxx substances. <br /><br />Also check out: http://bunkpolice.org/mdma-identification-guide/<br />

				a lot of people get concerned with the color of MDMA and from what I understand the color is most often associated with how many times it is washed after the synthesis process. The more times the product is washed the more white or clear it can become. As far as sticky goes sounds like something went wrong in the synthesis process so it did not crystallize properly. If it tests dark blue I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no real reason for alarm I feel. It may even be because there is too much MDMA in the product and not enough binding elements so you end up with something that did not crystallize correctly. However if it feels really processed and gummy kind of like the white powder you find on doughnuts it is most likely cut heavily and you just may not have the best time taking it.

				Captain, actually contacted the vendor about this issue since the product was indeed very very gummy. <br />He said that the results came in just after he shipped. The results where only 28% MDMA so I guess this shit is indeed heavily cut.<br /><br />Ofcourse the vendor apologized and offered me repackage. Guess what? Never heard of him since...<br />Too bad I FE&#039;d... :/ Such a shame. <br />

				Well hopefully he can work out some sort of resolution since he did find out his supplier messed with his product. If you are looking for a good quality vendor I would highly recommend Juergen2001 excellent vendor and his product has always been top notch

				Yo Rickard, no worries. He isn&#039;t! :) <br />I won&#039;t say his name because in the end he seems like a genuine guy, so hopefully we&#039;ll figure this out.<br /><br />Captain : Alright, i&#039;ll keep that in mind. I got some stuff from chemical brothers now. We&#039;ll see how that goes.<br /><br />Happy rolling!

I guess that highlights the limitations of reagent testing.<br />Do you remember if the colour change was instant?
