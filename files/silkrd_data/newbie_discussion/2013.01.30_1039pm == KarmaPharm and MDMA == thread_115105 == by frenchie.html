				It seems there is still some trouble having a stable and trustful source for MDMA on SR, same as a year ago. In the hope of getting the market going again I&#039;ve placed an order for KarmaPharm&#039;s 5g listing.<br />Now I realize I could simply limit myself to leaving a positive review if my experience is positive, but I&#039;m sure most SR members will agree that good U.S. MDMA at a &quot;reasonable&quot; price (which is relative of course) has been lacking and vendors have come and gone quite easily.<br />Hopefully, KarmaPharm will come through and a solid U.S. connect will be established. Also, before anyone points out that KarmaPharm has been on SR for a year and that he only has 5/5 reviews, please search for him on the forums and see how little feedback he has had. This is what I am trying to fix.

				I placed an order late last night with him and he messaged me right back and as of this morning, the order status had already changed to in transit.&nbsp; So far so good from my point of view.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update this thread when my package arrives.

				Empathy 101 has some of the best stuff on the market and at a really fair price. usa2usadutch is also a great vendor and he/she carries SuperTrips MDMA which is touted as some great shit.

				Just a quick update on my order.&nbsp; I placed it late on Tuesday night and low and behold, it arrived today(Friday) out on the west coast.&nbsp; Fast shipping.&nbsp; The packages were both vacuum sealed and the product looks quite good.&nbsp; Nice and crystally with some shard.&nbsp; Smells of black licorice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update this thread after I delve into some but as far as customer service and packaging goes, Karmapharm is 100% legit.&nbsp; I would order again for sure but it looks like he is currently out of product at the moment.

				I placed an order for 3.5 g with KarmaPharm just yesterday. I will update when I receive. Communication so far has been timely and agreeable. At $50/gram, is anyone doing cheaper domestically?

				I updated another thread, but not this one. KarmaPharm&#039;s MDMA was amazing. Great quality, 100 mg had me rolling nicely with a 60 mg booster (I&#039;m 5&#039;9&quot;, 145 lb). If I had the coin, I would buy more just to hold on to for this summer.

				I&#039;ve had KarmaPharm&#039;s MDMA in the past and found it very nice. Clean and pretty strong. Can&#039;t beat it for the price.

				I&#039;m still kinda on the fence about KP, and I have even bought and received from him. The product was really good, I must admit, and even his communication was really good, but his behavior is so erratic. Immediately after i ordered from him, he took all his listings down which sketched me out a bit, and I&#039;ve seen him suddenly take them down and put them back up a few other times. Maybe he&#039;s just really disorganized and is bad at keeping stock like he said on his page recently, but seems weird.<br /><br />As mentioned here earlier, there is STILL no feedback from anybody with high post counts. Someone tried to start a thread like this in the rumor mill section a while back and I was the only one that responded (before the 50 post rule), so of course the guy that started the thread was skeptical of my response. All those that seem to post about their experiences either don&#039;t have many posts or have a relatively large amount of posts in a short time. His feedbacks also seem to pop up in bunches I&#039;ve noticed.<br /><br />With all that said, it would also make sense why SR noobies would flock to KP, since he does have a good rating with a lot of feedback and only 50/g domestic, so I&#039;m def not accusing him of anything, just my thoughts on it. I just really wish someone that&#039;s trusted on the forums would post about an experience with him.

I actually took my listings down yesterday just to find a few ounces hiding in the back or my little prep area. The reason I have feedback in bunches, is because it takes forever to re-up. And I enjoy relaxing a lil bit in between =)<br /><br />Pretty sure that most people who are established on the forums, buy from overseas I&#039;d bet..<br /><br />Anywho,<br /><br />Much Love<br />Karma
