				Hi all, I&#039;m new and preparing to make my first buy on SR. Any tips for a first time buyer? Is there a &quot;best&quot; way to get bitcoins as far as security is involved? I plan on using Coinbase, but if that&#039;s not a good idea I&#039;m open to other suggestions.

				Just a small tip but certainly the most useful you can have : never FE = Finalize Early = Releasing funds to a vendor before receiving your order.

				Thanks for the tip, I had heard that before and don&#039;t plan on doing it. In the same realm, should I not trust a seller that requests n00bs to FE? Seems sketchy to me.

				Hey, lots of people have to FE early when you are a noob. Buy small amounts and look through all the feedback for the vendor you are interested to buy from. That way if you lose it is not a lot. I FE&#039;d 3 times before vendors stopped asking.

				Not really, in fact vendors ironically demand this so that they don&#039;t get scam.<br />See, it&#039;s easy to make a new account, order something, receive it but deny you did and get (part of) your money back.

				Well another tip : for your first purchase, buy small, and really try to find a &quot;noob accepting&quot; vendor. There are many that will let you order small quantities without demanding FE.

				hello<br />always check a vendors forum page as well if they have one. don&#039;t just go by the rating on SR. you will get a much better idea of their products, packaging and costumer service. <br /><br />

				Regarding finalizing early, it depends on what you&#039;re buying and the type of person who buys that thing. If you&#039;re buying a small bag of weed or some MDMA then you&#039;re unlikely to be asked to finalize early because most newbies buying weed or MDMA are real honest newbies. In this case, if you&#039;re being asked to finalize early then the vendor is likely scamming you.<br /><br />However, if, as a newbie, you&#039;re buying in bulk or buying opiates or cocaine then you&#039;re more likely to be an old scammer using a new account to get their goods cheaper by causing trouble for the vendor. In this case you can see why some people outright refuse to send to newbies until they&#039;ve received full payment.<br /><br />I&#039;ve finalized early in the past but only with trusted dealers who do top notch product and aren&#039;t known to be selective scammers, and only for small amounts.<br /><br />With FE you pays your money and takes your chances, never FE more than you mind losing and if you must do it, do it intelligently after a lot of research.

				Never FE.<br /><br />If you have your heart set on something that requires FE because you are new you really should pick something else. Failing that, message the vendor and explain your concerns BEFORE placing your order. It never hurts to ask.<br /><br />Never FE.

				hey all Im also brand new to the site...had heard of SR months ago but just thought it was another scam until i read into it and actually took the leap of faith and followed the tedious steps to remain anonymous! This site is sooooo legit, much better than risking a ton of money on a pakistan or indian online pharmacy. Still working out some kinks using PGP encryption software but set up my wallet and made my first bitcoin deposit and my local CVS&nbsp; ;D followed the steps and bam money on my SR account! I went with a benzo vendor for my first purchase I hope they allow first time buyers I would be skeptical to FE... well we shall see!<br /><br />good luck to you, make sure to change your pin and passphrase frequently and use encryption software or atleast privnote when sending sensitive information!
