				<br />Can someone walk me through a anonymous transaction at a bank?<br /><br />I mean do I go to X bank and just give them 1k&#039;s worth of funds and someone else&#039;s acct number and walk out? They will not ask for my name or anything?<br /><br />Will they give me trouble since it is not my acct that I am depositing money into?<br /><br />Finally is there any kind of safety net? I mean after I drop 1k into their acct and I get no BTC&#039;s or just get scammed am I SOL?

				Exactly what kind of BTC transaction are you talking about.&nbsp; It sounds like you found someone to buy BTC from and they want you to deposit money into their bank account, is that correct?<br /><br />

				Just like on SR, check the vendor reviews to decide who you will go with. <br /><br />It&#039;s easy once you do that to make a bank transfer. <br /><br />I use BOA. Just go in and get a deposit slip. FYI, if it&#039;s BOA, you will need a pink &quot;Out of State&quot; deposit slip if you&#039;re buying from someone out of state. <br /><br />Fill out the info that the seller gives you, which will probably just be a name, city and state, acct #. You do not need to give any of your info to the bank period. If by some crazy reason they did ask, just say that it&#039;s a relative or something you are sending money to. More than likely they won&#039;t ask and even if they do, it&#039;s none of their damn business anyways. I have a stack of deposit slips I picked up at BOA so all I have to do is go through the drivethru with the deposit slip filled out and cash, and BOOM. Done. Once you&#039;re done, message back the vendor with the info that they requested from the deposit receiept. Once they get that, they will release the bitcoins and they will show in your localbitcoin wallet and you can transfer from there to wherever you would like. <br /><br />First time I used localbitcoin I was amazed at the quickness and the communication from the seller.

				Just in general, If you are newer at buying BTC, do not buy from someone on craigslist or some random person you find online with a moneygram, bank deposit, cash in mail, ect.&nbsp; This method provides no safety net whatsoever.

				Yeah, Croskin is totally right.&nbsp; Make sure you only use localbitcoin for doing purchases like that.&nbsp; They have an escrow service if I&#039;m not mistaken.
