				I&#039;m a newbie here (duh!), and I&#039;ve noticed that the vendors I&#039;m mostly aware of seem to be low on supply at the moment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much of Cannabis is indoor vs outdoor, if it was outdoor, we should be seeing harvest time coming soon, in North America at least.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting a little low on my stash, should I buy now or wait a few weeks?<br /><br />For indoor, I imagine harvest times come every x number of weeks and growers have things planned out in such a way so that we aren&#039;t all completely dry and then suddenly up to our necks in cannabis.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t mind being up to my neck in cannabis, but also wouldn&#039;t like a 2 month dry spell either ;)

				Erm, if you go to the Cannabis tab, Weed, and then Sort By; highest Price, and go to Page 2... <br /><br />There are about 10-15 different vendors with lbs of greenhouse, outdoor, and indoor, mostly indoor, for 3000-3500.&nbsp; And a bunch more that just listed in the 25-29 range.&nbsp; Csheckit out meng&#039;

				thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in HPs or even QPs.&nbsp; I did a search based on newest listing.&nbsp; I&#039;m still considered relatively new on SR so there&#039;s that issue too.&nbsp; And I&#039;m looking for good Sativa as opposed to Indica.&nbsp; I have some leads I&#039;m doing research on.<br />
