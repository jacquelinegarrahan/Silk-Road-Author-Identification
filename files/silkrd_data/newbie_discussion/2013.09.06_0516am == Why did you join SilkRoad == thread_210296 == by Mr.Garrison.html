				I&#039;m sure pretty much everyones answer boils down to wanting to get drugs lol.<br /><br />But, more specifically, I was just looking for quality rolls that weren&#039;t taxed to shit like they are where I live. Not to mention the fact that you literally can not trust ANYTHING you get off the street nowadays. I work a full time job, pay rent, bill, taxes, like everyone else; and I find absolutely nothing wrong with responsibly using your drug of choice to take the edge off or have a good time here and there. I love SR, and every vendor I&#039;ve worked with so far has been nothing but a great experience. Truly an awesome thing they got goin on here, and I&#039;ll stand by it, despite these &quot;competitors&quot; popping up.

				I joined it for the access to the not so common drugs. Also, I wanted to see if I could get substances before they get &quot;stepped on&quot;(cut). When you live in a large metro area, you have access to pretty much all the drugs you need but I came to see what the road has to offer. I&#039;ll be honest, these prices suck! Could it be worth it? Is it uncut? Is it safer than meeting in the street? That&#039;s what I&#039;m here to find out.&nbsp; ;D

				I was just sick of paying high prices for something underweight and of poor quality. That and I had a very bad experience with pills that were sold to me as MDMA but turned out as what I suspect to be PMA. Bad times.

				That&#039;s funny you say that because I&#039;ve had a similar experience. A few years back I had blue smurfs and brown stars. I was young and stupid so I took them without testing them. I&#039;m not sure what was in either but I was tripped out for like 24 hours. It was a blast, don&#039;t get me wrong, but I have no idea what was in the pills. We possibly suspect some PMA in those blue smurfs. Not sure we&#039;ll ever know. I haven&#039;t seen good pills in a while. I&#039;m curious to check em out here on the road!!! Do you guys have any experience??

				I wanted to deal with respectable traders/venders, who take their work very seriously that and I&#039;m tired of people selling whatever research chemical they can find as acid, the local drug market just buys off here, and then sells nbome etc, as acid when people ask for it and don&#039;t tell them otherwise so they could take multiple hitting thinking they will be safe....this kills the man.

				It s my third international relocation in so many years. <br />I didn t see myself walking to the next derelict neighborhood and asking around for weed ... been there, done that too many times before ... I am a female, I don t look the part, so it s just too awkward<br /><br />Also, my partner knows nothing of my recreational habits, so I don t quite have the freedom to ask around in my social circle. <br /><br />SR has been a true savior. You type a few things on a keyboard, and wham, bam, in your mailbox. Discreet, safe, efficient. <br />Compared to the crappy hash I scored on the street in my previous city, it s like Christmas every time! <br /><br />And the community seems much nicer than I would have thought.

				I enjoy all types of substances from cannabis, to psychedelics, to mdma, to opioids; so I&#039;ve come to the road in search of higher purities and higher consistencies than could be found in the clubs, or on the street, especially when it comes to dope. I&#039;ve just placed my first two orders and hopefully it was worth it. One seller, seems to be living up to his rep and has immediately shipped my order. Another seller, though with a perfect 5.0 on over 100 transactions has not upheld his rep in my case. He hasn&#039;t responded to the one message I&#039;ve sent, nor has he marked the order as being in transit though he claims to ship same day and my order was placed well in advance of his cut-off time. I believe he&#039;ll come through, just would&#039;ve been nice if he had followed through on the details he&#039;s posted on his seller info page. Either way, I&#039;m glad the road exists. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll be a regular from here on out.

				Nice thread.<br /><br />I started experimenting with drugs pretty late (until a couple of years ago I only did weed, I am now almost 40) so I had no contacts IRL. I was going to a EDM festival and I decided I wanted to take some MDMA, thinking that taking just one pill to stay up all night would probably be much healthier than liters of Red Bull. As a lucky coincidence, SR got some media attention in a newspaper. Then I accessed SR for the first time. I was amazed. I remember thinking: &quot;The future is happening! NOW!&quot;<br /><br />Since then, I have tried mdma, 2c-b, methylone. Next step is LSD and maybe DMT after that. I am feeling very lucky that I have been given the possibility to experience all this, without any hassle and with low risk and high quality products. I have been reading a lot of DPR&#039;s comments and I realize how important SR is. It&#039;s not just about the drugs, it&#039;s about freedom.<br /><br />

				To incriminate myself, of course. ;) <br /><br />I&#039;m actually here to converse anonymously with like-minded individuals on topics that would raise some red flags elsewhere. We all have a common purpose. If you&#039;re on here, then you probably believe that the government has no business prohibiting the use and sale of drugs. Of course, I&#039;m also here to make purchases as well. People in person are pretty sketch, and it isn&#039;t like you can set up a review system for IRL dealers. Either you know somebody who has tried their stuff before or you don&#039;t. SR offers transparency about quality due to its review system. Despite the convenience, I&#039;ve also noted that prices are competitive to those that you would receive for similar product where I live, at least for cannabis. I don&#039;t really know enough about the other drugs to make a guess.

				Id have to say my reasons were probably 50/50. I had learnt about the silk road probably a year ago but never did too much research about it. The&nbsp; idea of being able to buy drugs without stress or hassle was very interesting i must say, but what really drove me over the line were the recent scandals over internet privacy and the actions that Goverments all over the world are taking against their citizens Worldwide. I guess my joining this community is my personal FUCK YOU to LE and the like.

				To get fucked up of course! I am just one of those people who happens to have an affinity for drugs....... And, more importantly, to say I was here, and participated in bringing the walls down. This is just a website facilitating trade in drugs, but the larger experiment with TOR and other anonymity networks is bringing about a type of collective sense of individual liberty that is more revolutionary than any of the political movements of the recent past. THIS is the kind of change in consciousness that political thinkers have been trying to impose from the top down. THIS is why governments, both &quot;free&quot; and authoritarian, are shitting themselves and rushing to outdo each other in removing their citizens&#039; rights and privacy. Think about the fact that many of us across the world, across every conceivable traditional divide trust &quot;people&quot; we know but have never seen more than our own governments, communicate in the same language, and have somewhat of a shared interest, even if it only constitutes claiming the right to doing what we want with our own bodies and minds. We are making each others&#039; sovereign governments break their own insane laws, and there isn&#039;t much they can do about it. It is only a beginning, but a momentous one. If SR or other sites like it become big enough, and the community of people developing the technologies which enable them stays ahead of the authorities, prohibition will eventually be broken. Either that, or search every piece of mail on the planet. Simple economics will win out. And it&#039;s not a stretch to see that a few decades more of rapid cultural and political development brought on by the online exchange of ideas and culture and whole ideas of national identity and hierarchical authority start to crumble. I know it sounds like a grandiose thesis, but as I said, think about what has already happened. Nothing of this sort has EVER been possible in human history.

				Obvious reason for myself too, easy access to drugs (primarily weed). <br /><br />More importantly I support the open market SR and bitcoins (and other crypto currency&#039;s and site&#039;s that are around) provide to the end user and vendor. Like most, scoring on the streets is tough and risky in most areas. Anonymously being able to purchase bitcoins and then anonymously order drugs or whatever your pleasure and then having them sent to the safety of your own home is to easy.

				Hi everyone,<br />I joined because a few months ago I wanted to try ecstasy.&nbsp; I figured I&#039;m the wrong side of 30 and it was time to see what everyone was raving about. I&#039;ve suffered from depression and severe social anxiety since I was a kid so not having a wide social circle and being to scared to go to clubs etc I couldn&#039;t get any. I did however eventualy manage to source some mdma from a friend of a friend and that is what brings me to the road. <br />&nbsp;I shared a gram with a close friend and it was the best weekend ever. For me personally one night with molly was more beneficial than the years of counciling and therapy. I say best weekend because the feeling of being completley at ease with the world lingered for day or so after taking it and I can&#039;t&nbsp; wait to do it again!<br />I had heard about the road previously but i have a regular guy for weed so didnt have any need for it until now. <br />So I&#039;ve spent the last month or so browsing the forums, learning about how it all works, how to stay safe and use PGP etc and I finally got brave enough to create a forum account and post something :)

				Why did I join?<br /><br />To buy drugs without fear of:<br /><br />1. Being stabbed or shot by some paranoid junkie dealer<br />2. Being ripped off. Well, I&#039;m not guaranteed 100% success rate for every order...Shit happens. Just saying that my chances of being ripped off is significantly less on here, especially if I just use some common sense myself and pay close attention to the forums for reviews and lists of scammers, than on the street where paranoid junkie dealers rule.<br />3. Constantly buying poor quality merchandise. Again, not 100% gauranteed that every product from every vendor will be AS ADVERTISED, but my success rate here is likely to be higher than on the street.<br />4. Having to hang out with drug dealers! THIS GOES FOR POT DEALERS, METH DEALERS, PILL DEALERS, ETC.<br /><br />ESPECIALLY THE METH DEALERS!!! Jesus christ. Don&#039;t get me wrong. I love me some meth now and again...but meth dealers I&#039;ve met personally are the CRAZIEST FUCKERS ON THE PLANET!<br /><br />I watched one of them one day shoot up with a dirty rig using beer in lieu of water. Dirty warm beer that likely had a cigarette butt floating around in the can, He then, promptly after taking the most horrendous shot fucking ever, took apart his cell phone and asked me if I knew anything about the DEA bugging his phone. <br /><br /><br />So yeah, in summation, I joined for all the reasons above....but mainly so I don&#039;t have to deal with with dudes like the one I just mentioned.<br /><br /><br />Oh, and I still haven&#039;t used SR just yet! Haha. I&#039;m currently weighting on some BTC to come in and am just lurking as much as I can here to learn as much as humanly possible before it arrives...even though I&#039;ve been visiting and studying the site for 4 months now. I like to be thorough.
