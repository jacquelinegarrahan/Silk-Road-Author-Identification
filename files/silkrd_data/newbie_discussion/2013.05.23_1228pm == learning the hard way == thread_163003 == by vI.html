				i have countless orders here and EVERY single one came through. In fact in between i had 2 legit packages do not come in from ebay (one of it i had to get from the toll and open it in front of them)! Crooks are everywhere. U just have to know what to look out for. I usually only buy from (100) vendors. Maybe (99) But (98) already makes me curious. Ill check for the comments and if there are 1-2 legit looking bad reviews i will most likely not buy from them.<br /><br />I never had to FE yet. I would pic vendors who dont require FE. For every product there are enough (100) vendors who dont require FE. U want to search for &#039;newest&#039; rather than &#039;bestselling&#039; sometimes (there are also a lot of cheap sample offers *hint hint*).<br /><br />If you dont take any risks here on the road you are almost 100% safe. Buy only small amounts, no vendor will risk his reputation/business and/or his pricey vendor account for a small amount of whatever. Big amounts only from the most trusted vendors and preferably domestic. <br /><br />If u follow some rules as a customer u can barely ever get scammed here. The most secure system there is. <br /><br />If a vendor has 35 positive transactions he can put what ever he wants in his TOS. U have to read it, u have to agree to it before buying. If u choose to do so u have to abide by it. U can always turn around and go for another vendor. If u choose to gamble and FE its your own decision. SR highly discourage it. Dont come here and blame SR for ur own faults. Take it as a lesson and grow from it.<br /><br />Have a nice day

				thanks for reply b0m, all makes sense<br /><br />what happened was: order placed with 100 vendor who is also in top 10 international and top 5 domestic, good feedback all over.<br /><br />my thinking is that things here move not very fast, and for business to have a repeat customer is a good thing.<br /><br />stuff came in very quick and skillfully packaged, but it was crap, hence 100 ranking did not work in my case, not sure what I could have done differently.<br /><br />so either the vendor decided to save a few bucks, or someone working for the vendor did it behind his back.<br /><br />the other vendor who seem to disappear could have made more money faster mugging a little old ladies, than going thru with &quot;losing&quot; my $50 order

				Yes it sucks to get a bad product. Glad i never experienced that. What u could have done better is to contact the seller to figure if he is willing to figure something out about ur problem rather than come to the forum and point the finger to SR and say its all bad :P because i cant see anything that could be improved to make it safer. Can u? That being said i am part of blackmarkets for more than 6 years and i have never experienced such a safe one. Specially technical wise. Not to mention the uber nice atmosphere prevails. <br /><br />This is paradise on earth at its best! The only thing i still miss is the Caribbean island DPR should provide all his Top Vendors AND me :D

It&#039;s important for other new and relatively new people like myself to know what can go wrong here. I&#039;m really sorry to hear that your first two experiences turned out so bad. It still might be worthwhile tho contacting the 1st vendor about the bunk product you got....perhaps he might be reasonable and replace it, altho I wouldn&#039;t hold out too much hope. It sounds as if he is a selective scammer.<br /><br />I hope you have much better luck with your future orders.

				1 out of 10 or 20 would equal (90) - (95). And his business would be almost over here. Thats not the case. 1 out of 100 is something a good vendor could do without hurting his reputation/stats too much. Tho i dont believe anyone who got that good of a customer base needs ur 50$. They might hit once in a while when a 500-???$ order gets FE&#039;d. Vendors like that their time is worth more than what they get cutting ur stuff... it just doesnt make any sense at all. They get more profit making u a happy,returning customer plus they save time not cutting ur stuff. It doesnt add up in my book.<br /><br />About the safety thing. Thats why smart people use PO boxes or a good fake-address. At the end of the day the Seller doesnt know if its your address, from your friend, or a entire fake-address.<br /><br />There is something that could be changed and it happens A LOT on here. That is talking with the vendor and let him try to make u satisfied. Either with somewhat of a refund, reship, bonus on ur next order or what ever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">so all new people out there, get a nice big jar of vaseline and get ready :))</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That one made my day.

				Never, EVER FE. It&#039;s as simple as that. If they require it for low-purchase-history buyers, find another vendor peddling the same (or similar product). Build your cred. Eventually the trust will come and you&#039;ll be free of your &quot;noob&quot; status.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re new if you&#039;re posting a question like that here. My apologies if you are not and are just new to the SR forums (like me).

Cops need a warrant or probable cause to come looking for drugs at your house. A drug dealer is not going to give his info to LE, because then you can let his local PD know about his trafficking.

				I&#039;ve made over 25 purchases from SR, all from top sellers. I was only disappointed with one or two of the products. Most vendors in the top 100 are great, but I choose to read each seller&#039;s reviews thoroughly before purchasing to get a really good idea of what kind of quality product they&#039;re selling. The 100% feedback doesn&#039;t mean much, as most buyers feel pressured to leave a 5/5 if the product gets to them discreetly and on time.
