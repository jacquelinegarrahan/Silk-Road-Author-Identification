				Im getting fed up with this. First a friend tells me that I should use bitinstant to just send the funds directly to my SR address. I try verifying with people on forums and am told its to risky. Then I hear about sending funds to MT GOX -&gt; blockchain -&gt; sr wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet now im hearing MT GOX is a no go since they are asking for I.D&#039;s and verification. <br /><br />Can someone please just tell me what to do..I swear Iv looked through the forums and online..I keep coming up empty handed..I just want an easy secure way to get some BTC so i can buy some damn drugs lol. Any help would be very much appreciated. <br /><br />Also trying to figure this out in the U.S. I know methods can vary depending on country. Im only planning on buying 1-2 BTC at a time, nothing crazy.

				I&#039;ve also had some questions when depositing cash for BTC. I ended up doing a cash deposit through bitinstant and then that takes me to a moneygram location. When depositing via moneygram, be sure to remember an alius to give them. They&#039;ll ask for your name and address and be sure those fake details that you told them match up with the name and phone number you used on bitinstant. I messed up the first time and ended up giving them the wrong name. I found someone&#039;s license in the parking lot the other day so I&#039;m just going to use that and a prepaid phone number. Also, when depositing, remember to say you&#039;re paying a bill - it goes easier that way and they won&#039;t ask for as much info compared to when you say you&#039;re sending money to someone.

				localbitcoins seems good. Where do they request payment..Its similar to bitinstand i assume? Print slip and pay at bank or wallmart? <br /><br />I checked out BST but it seemed confusing and a little sketchy...also they said they are booked until thur morning.

				Go to localbitcoins.com, find someone close to you willing to sell you bitcoins. You buy direct from someone who has bitcoins, no exchanges or paperwork. The best way is to meet them face to face, give them cash and get your coins.......OR....get them to enable the escrow on the purchase, deposit the cash into their bank account, and then when the money is available in their account, they release the coins to you. Its possible to have coins in minutes using localbitcoins with zero hassles if done right.

Forget this i think im going to just use bitinstant -&gt; blockchain -&gt; SR.&nbsp; I hear the only problem with them is they may capitalize on spread. But fuck it..meeting someone in person and dealing with Blue sky or what ever seems like too much trouble and risk. Thanks for the help though...much appreciated

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

And he said Mt Gox doesnt verify...but im pretty sure thats wrong..there is a topic in the &quot;security&quot; page of the forums called &quot;MT GOX is dead for roaders&quot; and numerous complaints about Mt Gox requiring verification...idk seems fishy to me.

				If you&#039;re curious about Mt Gox requiring verification, try it yourself.<br />Sign up using an anon email like hotmail.<br />Notice you are not asked for your name, dob, etc.<br />You an then use technique described in guide to fund the account.<br />Once funded, you buy BTC and move to the road.<br />Wherefore &quot;fishy&quot;?<br />Peace,<br />MW
