				Hi Newbies!!<br />Link to Porn Star&#039;s vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/698fb63183<br />No FE required.<br />I grow myself, but may also have strains from different growers, so if a particular strain isn&#039;t to your taste, it&#039;s fine for you to mention it, but I&#039;d appreciate if you also mention the qualitiy of our stealth, shipping, and communication. I&#039;m happy to answer any questions you might have.<br /><br />Low introductory prices!!!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D You know I had to pay $500 bond to sign up as a vendor, and I&#039;m not going to rip you off for a $30 1/8th. Go ahead and give us a try!<br />Happy Smokin&#039; People!!!!!<br /><br />EDIT: Woops, I had listed some QP,HP,LB listings if people wanted to FE. Didn&#039;t realize that would upset people. They are DELETED listings now. I didn&#039;t really expect to sell any larger weights anyway until a month or so when I&#039;ve got some feedback going. None of my listings require FE for anyone. I may cancel orders for people with really bad stats though. Limit 1/2 oz for 0/0 buyers.

				Um, you say you don&#039;t ask for FE, but on the larger, more riskier orders you ask to FE. It kinda doesn&#039;t make sense to ask FE for larger orders IMO. I understand you want your money soon, especially when its a large sum, but escrow is in place to protect BOTH buyer and seller.&nbsp; With that said, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re allowed to request FE until you have some good rep. <br /><br />I would be willing to try a sample and compare it to some of the other weed vendors I order from. I have several thousand spent on SR and no refund rate. I can also type up a nice detailed review or something.

				Hey Porn Star,<br /><br />Welcome to the Road! Competition is always welcome. <br /><br />Your eye candy is catchy. But to be even more mainstream you have to appeal to women as well as men. Soft porn does not impress the cannabis connoisseur as much a closeup of spread trichomes moist with dust.<br /><br />Seriously, large corporations always use a loss leader when introducing a new product. Samples will improve the viral qualities you seek to assume.<br /><br />Another principle, to be popular you gotta be people-friendly. Be different, study your competition and make yourself look fresh and interesting. That means making your customers into your devotees. Be an Apple instead of a Wintel. <br /><br />Spread a little love with samples and watch the popularity of your goods go up.<br /><br />Hey- For a sample of the ECSD I&#039;ll spread the gospel for you.&nbsp; We can help each other. Shoot me a pm&nbsp; &nbsp;8) <br /><br />Toke it ez&nbsp; ;)

				My bad people. I&#039;m heading over to delete the larger offerings I had up. Didn&#039;t realize it was a faux pas. I&#039;ll stick to 100% escrow until I&#039;ve proved myself to you all.

				There we go, all of those larger listings are deleted now. I only have listings from 1/8th to 1oz at the moment. Purchases from people with really bad stats will be cancelled. Also, 0/0 buyers please stick to 1/2 or smaller orders at first.<br /><br />Slowturtle, your point is made. I only have non-FE listings. But I will point out that escrow only protects buyers. I can&#039;t see how a seller would be protected by having money withheld from them. I happily admit that the escrow system is a wonderful and necessary part of the process giving buyers the confidence and protection they need to take a chance on a seller. Without escrow the system as a whole might fall apart or be impossible for new sellers to break into. So in terms of the big picture, sellers are certainly better off.<br /><br />Praetorian, no worries. No hard feelings. Unwanted listings have been removed.<br /><br />Thanks for the input. I&#039;m always looking to improve.

				Sativanist,<br />Thanks for the suggestions. The eye candy is something I&#039;ve thought about. I just wanted to get some listings online this weekend. I&#039;m a little paranoid about security and didn&#039;t really want photographic evidence lying around. Figured I&#039;d want a dedicated camera. I chose a tame avatar for the forum, and people concerned about NSFW stuff on the main site will likely have chosen &#039;incognito browsing&#039; in their account settings.<br /><br />My weed is quality and I&#039;m serious and very professional. I think people will be very happy with the results. I might consider a sample for a respected forum hero member, but I don&#039;t really mind if sales start out a little slow. The other problem with samples is that my strains change fairly frequently, so by the time I got a review, I might be out of that particular strain.<br /><br />Thanks again for making suggestions to improve the road experience!! Have a great day!

				I&#039;m not sure about shipping across borders. Love the UK! Love lots of countries, but I&#039;m just a little unsure about how to go through customs in a bulletproof fashion. Also, I&#039;m nervous about filling out customs forms. For now, I&#039;m going to keep everything inside USA borders. Sorry about that.<br />Cheers Mate!

				Praetorian,<br />I just noticed that you mentioned retracting your complaint. Cool! Thanks. I appreciate that you recognize the difference between a faux pas and a scam. <br />All orders will stay in escrow for the forseeable future. I&#039;ll open up QP,HP,LBs over time.

				This is very exciting! I&#039;ve got 5 small orders that will go out tomorrow (Monday). Anyone who orders before 9am Pacific/12 noon Eastern on Monday morning can expect their order to go out Monday. Most orders should arrive Wednesday, possibly Thursday. Tomorrow is going to be very fun. Packaging is done at the last minute so odors don&#039;t have time to try to escape.<br /><br />BIG thanks to the 5 of you who have decided to give me a chance!!!!!!
