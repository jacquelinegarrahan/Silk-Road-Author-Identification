				The Silk Road has a lot of press coverage. A LOT. Swarms of young people flock here to get scammed by rippers. I would rather purchase from a violent degenerate in person who does not know my real name or where I live than give a random junkie/middleman my home ady and hope for the best. <br /><br />If I cannot source an item from a thug or a yuppie with connections I will go without. I do not make money to piss it away in the wind or risk coming under investigation by the government agencies keeping tabs here.&nbsp;

				why even get on sr then. i understand what youre saying but idt you understand what you are saying or dont know enough ab it. i think you are more likely to get busted or ripped off on the street by your hippie/thug friends. and you always know what youre getting from sr vendors if you do your research and know the vendor is quality. i would say the most of the vendors on here are professional and not hippie/thugs. they are business ppl who dedicate their time to serve and please buyers. i picture most of the vendors on sr to be educated and honest. if they werent, they wouldnt make it as vendors. but, this is my opinion and you have yours. so i guess continue to shop around in the hood and ghettos for your drugs. or wherever these hippies and thugs are you speak of.

				Unlike your lame ass weekend warrior drug dealer at home, there is more money to be made being legit than ripping people off, so your logic fails. Bye.

				&nbsp;Maybe my post came of as abrasive. More to the point there are sites out there that do the same thing as Silk Road but without the horse or marching powder. These sites are on clearnet and are not exactly subtle but appear to have far less scamming going on. If a source is identified as a selective scammer or threatens to snitch on the client he should be rolled or banned. There is a code that you do not rip your associate and you do no threaten to go to the authorities. The posts that I have read here indicate that this is common. WTF? How are they still here? My cuzin lives by a code. Why doesn&#039;t the code exist here?<br /><br />But the hallucinogens man. I am here for the freaks stuff. Different personalities I hope.&nbsp;
