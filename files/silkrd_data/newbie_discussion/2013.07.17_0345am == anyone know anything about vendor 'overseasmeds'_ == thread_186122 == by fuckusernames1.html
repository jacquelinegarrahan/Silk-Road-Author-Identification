				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0c93ca49d2<br /><br /><br />that is a link to their page. they have been a vendor for 2 weeks or so and i placed an order for a sample listing they had up but is now down. Does this seem legit to you guys? for some reason i feel kinda sketched by the whole thing. i have many transactions on SR and stuff, but this just seemed off to me. I dont see anything on the forums. Ive been parnoid its LE trying to get address or something but this would be insane right? any one have input?

				I ordered a 3 x 30mg sample of were called &quot;Oxycodone Copies.&quot; I assumed this meant they would be pills that resembled a generic 30mg oxycodone pill, and contained oxycodone. The next day the listing was changed to &quot;Oxycodone Copies/Counterfeits/Fakes&quot; and a disclaimer on the page (not there when I made my order) said the pills would not contain any actual oxycodone, but rather &quot;the strongest pain medication overseasmeds can get there hands on.&quot; All of which is still up on the product page. <br /><br />I messaged him with my concern about what this &quot;medication&quot; was, and that I felt I had been mislead by his wording. After days of unprofessional messages, containing an incredible amount of spelling and grammatical errors and nonsensical rambling, he finally answered my question. According to overseasmeds, the &quot;Oxycodone Copies&quot; contain 15mg of Codeine and 15 mg of Tramadol. The order arrived, and to the vendor&#039;s credit the pills look nearly identical to an actual 30mg Oxy. Visually, they would pass to most people on the street as a pill containing 30mg of Oxycodone. You can look it up on something as simple as Google based on shape, color, imprints, and scoring. It will match. Chemically speaking, I think calling it a &quot;copy&quot; is a joke and incredibly misleading. The three chemicals mentioned are similar in that they are all pain killers, but the potency of one of these &quot;copies&quot; is not even remotely close to the real thing, as Oxycodone is roughly 20 times more potent than Codeine, mg for mg. Tramadol is nearly negligible to almost any opiate user, certainly when doses are generally no less than 50mg for mild-moderate pain. At the dosages overseasmeds gave to me, you would have ZERO doubt you were scammed no more than half an hour after ingesting the pill. <br /><br />For the record, I did finalize my order. I was sick of trudging through his messages to find any real information, and due to the codeine content and appearance, decided the pills could be called &quot;low quality counterfeits.&quot; I also felt the cost was worth the opportunity to reveal the pills&#039; contents on the product page.<br /><br />These pills are being sold (most likely) so that dealers on the street can rip people off by selling these Oxy look-a-likes as the real thing for a huge profit. I do NOT agree with this practice whatsoever (why would you want to buy a pill that looked like the real thing but had no actual effect? Or are you greedy enough to sell snake oil?). TSR is a truly free market; therefore, overseasmeds should be allowed to sell his/her/their wares. The market, through reviews like this, will decide his fate. <br /><br />UNLESS YOU WANT BUNK PILLS, DO NOT BUY FROM OVERSEASMEDS

				I&#039;m sorry to report that the &quot;Oxycodone Copies&quot; I received from overseasmeds do NOT contain any Codeine, Morphine, Tramadol, Oxycodone, or even Asprin whatsoever. I tested multiple samples using an entire crushed pill with Marquis, Mecke, Mandelin, and Simon reagents finding absolutely 0% of the substances he mentioned in a PM to me (which I assume was just in order to appease my questioning). <br /><br />These pills are chalk made to look like Oxy&#039;s and nothing more. I have to assume the same about his Suboxone and Xanax &quot;fakes&quot; as well.

				Why would anyone buy any of his counterfeit crap other than to rip someone else off or, maybe just out of lack of knowledge????<br /><br />overseasmeds is a thief and a scam artist. What he is selling could really hurt someone in real need of the &quot;real&quot; version of what he is selling &quot;copies&quot; of.<br /><br />People selling that kind of crap aught to be sent packing off of the road in my opinion.<br /><br />And get him some english language classes, please!!! lol<br /><br />H

Customs. Seizure. :( MODZIW has fresh oxy 30&#039;s. Ordered 5 that came in yesterday. A-215&#039;s. Also ordered some OC 40&#039;S from MDPRO a couple of weeks ago and they were the original OC&#039;s still in the blister pack. They were made by a German pharmaceutical company, but were definitely legit.
