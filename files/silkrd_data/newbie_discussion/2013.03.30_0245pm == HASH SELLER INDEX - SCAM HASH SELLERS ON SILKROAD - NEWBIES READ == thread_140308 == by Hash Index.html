				just curious.. what does mrouid send out??&nbsp; it looks like maroc to me in his pics (although not exactly &quot;premiuim&quot;).&nbsp; what else would you even send out??&nbsp; hash like that is fairly easy to source and dirt cheap, esp in canada, so it really almost seems like a waste of time to send out something that&#039;s just bunk..&nbsp; i was looking into buying his maroc just to flip it (this kind of hash can go for 30/g around here), but i don&#039;t wanna just buy some bullshit.&nbsp;

				I can vouch for MROiud.&nbsp; <br /><br />He is a good vendor to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;His hash is a bit weak, but it&#039;s legit.&nbsp; It&#039;s not marroc. Really , but it&#039;s reasonable and not cut or anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s just water hash from some grow op. I&#039;m sure of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s brown hash and mine was a bit moist still.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the price. $100. For 10 grams is awesome. Something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found that weed for the same price lasted about just as long smoking in pipes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I hate to see his name in here.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; His weed is killer.&nbsp; His coke is good.&nbsp; His speed pills are good. <br /><br />I&#039;ll admit his marrocan hash picture is very old .&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t bad any vendors unless you have proof please.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				If you kids are really into hash, yu should look into making yur own.&nbsp; &nbsp;You buy some cheap weed or some of the &#039;shake&#039; for sale on the road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then, you grind it up and dump it all into a bucket/container with very cold water and ice cubes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then, you mix the hell out of it with a cake mixer or drill with a mixer attachment on it.&nbsp; Mix mix mix .<br /><br />Then, you pour it through some ladies stockings as a filter.&nbsp; It will catch all the leafy crap and the resin will slip through the holes and Ito the bucket/container with the water.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now you have a bucket of water/ice and resin floating around in it.&nbsp; <br />Pour it through another filter, this time use a finer filter such as an old t shirt stretched over a container tightly.&nbsp; Pour slowly Ito the t shirt and it will catch all the resin and the water will slip through. <br /><br />Now you carefully scrape up the resin with a razor , scraping it off the wet t shirt.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now you have a pile of wet hash.&nbsp; You press it into a napkin several times to draw te water out. Keep pressing or use a rolling pin. All the water will leach out into the napkin. <br /><br />Now you have&nbsp; slightly wet hash.&nbsp; Dry it the rest of the way on a sheet of foil over a toaster and carefully watch it. Flip and flip and press and press until its totally dry<br /><br />---- now you have great hash!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Bubble bags are better , but this yields the same quality and amount.&nbsp; The hash ends up being light brown and hard.&nbsp; Very good hash<br /><br />Black hash = bacteria and oxidization .&nbsp; That&#039;s why it&#039;s black<br /><br />Brown hash = slightly degraded resin glands , mostly resin stalks <br /><br />Light brown hash =. Resin from the top of the resin glands, the little balls that sit on top of the glands/stalks -<br />&nbsp; The best hash possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, I get it near white in color. My hash is usually transparent.!!!!<br /><br />Finer filters = finer hash, but less of it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Looser filters = dark or black hash, and more of it.<br />Take your pick of what yu want.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope this helps someone. <br /><br />I can provide more &#039; ghetto &#039; concentrates ideas.&nbsp; I live in Heidelberg of nowhere so I have to invent my own equipment.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />I even make my own organic grow food from decayed fish and animal dung.&nbsp; &nbsp;Better than any grow store food. <br /><br />My last batch of butane honey oil was white, clear oil that was hard like plastic. It had to be melted to be able to move it or unstick it.&nbsp; It&#039;s like glue.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Whip that shit up with a mixer and a bit of heat and you got budder. I like whipping my honey oil into a soft solid that is like taffy <br />

				I have to come to the defense of Globalshipping.<br />His hash was my first order on SR and I have bought again from him.<br />The standard hash is a notch better than the Standard 3rd grade everywhere else.<br />Shipping may be faster with other vendors but I consider shipping times irrelevant. Safety comes first and his stealth is decent.

				Although I&#039;m just starting to post in the forums I have been on the road for 6 months so far and have found some great hash vendors.<br /><br />Emerald- good variety, fair prices and the hash that iv got from them is always bomb and a little over weight<br /><br />The scurvy crew- Great forum presence, good variety, offers sample packs and weekend kits that I have tried and been very happy with at 14 bucks a gram and 20 for the weekend kits. Iv tried three kinds of these hash and all were great for price, I suggest there Pakistani pollen<br /><br />Spanishfly- iv tried his double zero, Pakistani vanilla and&nbsp; &quot;ice cream&quot;. Prices are fair for quality. Always been fast service and delivery <br /><br />Those are my three favorite, I believe they are all based in Spain. I&#039;m if Canada and they take 6-10 days from order in most cases and the last two never ask for FE. Hope this helps

				I got a little hash and some weed off MMM but this was maybe 4 months ago. Seemed on the level at the time but I have since read in threads that he may be a selective scammer. <br />I&#039;m not saying I know ether way but can confirm he does get some people there stuff.<br />You could always try a small order with him and see how it goes, wait to finalize so you have some protection

				I&#039;ve enjoyed reading through this thread.<br /><br />As someone with fairly high level of education, I find the moral of the story here is do not finalize early.

				I&#039;ve ordered from 3 vendors in order<br /><br />Greenovendoor- CBD co2 oil in a shooter. Dabbed it out of a nail. Wasn&#039;t too harsh tasted good. Got me stoned af. I probably won&#039;t order again unless I get rich because the price was a little high for me. But then again it is co2 oil. I do order their bud on the regular though.<br /><br />Cannabinologist- I ordered 5 grams of bho. It was a budder consistency yellow color. Smells and tasted great. It vaped on the ti nail clean no residue no bad aftertaste. This was definitely properly purged. It was definitely the quality I&#039;d expect from a dispensary. Will order again.<br /><br />420connections- I already wrote an indepth review about his oil with pictures and close up macro shots check it out. I ordered a quarter because it was very cheap. I got a quarter of really dark unpurged oil full of bubbles. Sparkled and sizzled on the nail left a nasty residue with a nasty smell everytime the nail was cooling. It would catch on fire and spit out fire balls when lit. I wrote him about it. From what he said I interpreted that he has someone making the shit for him that has no idea what they&#039;re doing. I asked for a refund or at least a partial because I had to go buy purging equiptment. He said he would hook it up fat next time. And didn&#039;t reply after I said I wouldn&#039;t be ordering again, just give me a refund. He promised he would step up the quality.<br /><br />Looking at his page every few people give reviews about it being black and unpurged. He also dropped prices for an &quot;appreciation sale&quot;. I&quot;m not sure whether he&#039;s just trying to get rid of his oil and all the noobs are giving 5/5 and only a few people can tell its bad oil or he&#039;s giving some people good oil and some the black shit. Either way you&#039;ve been warned.<br /><br />

				I ordered xinhais sample pack. I was going to write a rave review after smoking some of the caviar. Until I found a rubber weight? or grommet or rubber something inside the 2nd biggest piece of caviar I got.<br /><br />WTF I almost smoked a piece of rubber. I need to fucking know if this was an accident or if he&#039;s skimping people with rubber weights wrapped in hash for some reason. Nobody else has mentioned this.<br />I inspected the other piece of caviar that I hadn&#039;t smoked yet and no rubber weight but I pulled it apart and it doesn&#039;t seem like its a bud that was dipped in oil. It seems like the whole thing is hash.<br /><br />I need a quality check on the caviar from someone else. I&#039;m pretty pissed right now. I don&#039;t think I smoked any rubber or I would have noticed it. <br />

I ordered a quarter because it was very cheap. I got a quarter of really dark unpurged oil full of bubbles. Sparkled and sizzled on the nail left a nasty residue with a nasty smell everytime the nail was cooling. It would catch on fire and spit out fire balls when lit. I wrote him about it. From what he said I interpreted that he has someone making the shit for him that has no idea what they&#039;re doing. I asked for a refund or at least a partial because I had to go buy purging equiptment. He said he would hook it up fat next time. And didn&#039;t reply after I said I wouldn&#039;t be ordering again, just give me a refund. He promised he would step up the quality.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wanted to chime in with the results of my order from 420connections. I got an 1/8 and it arrived promptly. I&#039;m not extremely experienced with oil, but I&#039;ve had no complaints and I made sure to check for the problems you noted. It is dark in color but not completely opaque looking at it on the dabber and when it&#039;s a bit stretched out. Not sure if that makes a difference, but the appearance is pretty much exactly what was pictured on the listing. I can&#039;t discern any noticeable crackling or sizzling on the nail. It does leave a slight residue, but again I&#039;m not entirely sure how normal/abnormal that is. As for the potency of it I have absolutely no complaints. I&#039;ve been enjoying the hell out of it frankly. Perhaps he&#039;s solved whatever problem he was having, so I wanted to vouch for him. A good transaction on all counts as far as I can tell, especially for the price.
