				my guess is that a shady seller will more likely rip you off if you don&#039;t use pgp than if you do.<br />using pgp tells the seller that at least you understand the bare minimum of the silk road......and that possibly you aren&#039;t a noob.

				If you don&#039;t want LE up your ass and around the corner learn how to use PGP.<br />If you don&#039;t want your balls scammed off learn how to use PGP.<br />YouTube. Look up a PGP tutorial on YouTube and head over to the PGP practice thread.<br />Also, the forum is your friend, look up vendors before you blindly make a transaction with them..

				I wouldn&#039;t jump to that conclusion. Just make sure you use PGP from now on. I made the mistake of FE&#039;ing early on, and learned my lesson. Sometimes making a mistake is what it takes to learn. Or you could read the forums.

				Posts like this make me worry about the future of this site.<br /><br />I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t want the kind of vendor who doesn&#039;t insist on using PGP for any sensitive communication to have any of my information in the first place.&nbsp; The answer to OP&#039;s question is probably yes...but it doesn&#039;t matter because there are a lot better reasons to always use PGP than to not get scammed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hana, it might be in your best interest if you did get scammed.&nbsp; Maybe that would prompt you to take your time, do your research, and understand what you&#039;re doing and the potential risks you face for not taking simple precautions.&nbsp; If you guys aren&#039;t even using PGP, I shudder to think of the other precautions you aren&#039;t taking to keep yourself (and ultimately, this whole site) safe.

				Hana, lets say that you place an order with a vendor without using PGP. Now, let&#039;s say for some reason the LE gets a hold of his account. Everyone else who has sent this vendor information using PGP is safe considering he&#039;s the only one with the password to decrypt the messages sent to him containing your sensitive information such as addresses and names. He&#039;s probably doesn&#039;t want to get any deeper in to shit than he already is so he&#039;s going to keep his mouth shut. But your message is out in the open because you said &#039;fuck learning PGP&#039;. You name, your address, right there. The LE now knows where to find you, and the vendor gets screwed over. Or lets say it&#039;s a hacker looking to exploit you, you&#039;re screwed. Things can get out of hand without PGP, it&#039;s possible. PGP is there for your safety as well as the vendor. So just look up a youtube tutorial or something and head over to the PGP thread on here for practice. These small steps go a long way.

				PGP is simple to set up and simple to use once you get used to it. There just is no good reason not to be using it. <br /><br />I have now added slightly more to the discussion than one of those posting random characters over at the &quot;get to 50&quot; threads.

				quote &quot;Me I don&#039;t know how to use it im a noob :( &quot;<br /><br /><br />quoted from my first decent post this morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;the following info below was taken from:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175158.0<br /><br /><br />**Encryption:<br />learn proper PGP and use nothing else including privnote or any other 3rd party bullshit. any encryption you use should absolutely be Open-source!! A great tool for beginners is Adele(automated account to test your PGP skills. Check it out) I&#039;ll edit with a CLEARNET link. <br />* Another very easy tip to remember is if you receive an encrypted message and have to get online to retrieve a key to decrypt it, that means it was done wrong. it was encrypted with the senders Private Key not your public key, same goes in reverse.&nbsp; *This is a SURE sign you are not doing it right, &quot;you&#039;re close but still not correct usage and not secure.<br />&nbsp;<br />* BUY THESE TWO BOOKS AND READ THEM!:&nbsp; Both are by Mike Lucas &quot;PGP &amp; GPG: Email for the Practical Paranoid&quot; The other MUST read book by M.Lucas is titled &quot;SSH Mastery: OpenSSH, PuTTY, Tunnels and Keys&quot;.<br />I bet Gen. Patreaus wished he&#039;d spent the $25 for &quot;PGP &amp; GPG ...&quot;? That&#039;s really is a good lesson, when the head of the fucking CIA doesn&#039;t even know how to keep his email private its worth taking the time to learn. Its pretty easy.<br /><br />* Like I said I&#039;m not an expert but I try to do my research... that being said, to browse the web w/out someone looking over your shoulder I guess stuff like &quot;tor2web&quot; is OK but I would never ever use it for SR. Please correct me if I am wrong, I will not be offended, I&#039;ll be grateful. I want to help people be safe for their sake and all of our protection. I DO NOT want to spread mis-information so don&#039;t be shy.<br />
