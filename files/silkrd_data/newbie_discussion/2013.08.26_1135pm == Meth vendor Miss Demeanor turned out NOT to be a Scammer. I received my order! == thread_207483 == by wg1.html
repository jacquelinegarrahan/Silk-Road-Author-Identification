				Hi all, I started this thread for myself and other noobs who do not have enough posts to use the &#039;real&#039; forums.<br />The official review thread for Miss Demeanor (meth vendor) is here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174662.0<br /><br />Miss Demeanor turned out not to be a scammer (like many had feared) so I wanted to jump on here and write a positive review of my experience to help build her reputation back up.<br /><br />I was amongst the group of people who had their orders cancelled after being marked in transit. Mine was in transit for 10 days then was cancelled for no apparent reason. I received a full refund but no message from the vendor to explain why it was cancelled. I jumped to conclusions as it seemed that nobody else had received their orders and sooooo many people had FE. All signs at this point were negative and I really did not expect the goods would come.<br /><br />Now I eat my words. Miss Demeanor came through with the goods. My package arrived safely yesterday, approximately 11 days after being marked in transit. Stealth was good and the product was appropriately sealed and hidden inside.<br /><br />It seemed so odd to me that a vendor would cancel all orders in Escrow and give a general reason to other people that it was &quot;too hard to keep track of the orders&quot; but obviously I, (and many others) were completely wrong.<br /><br />Miss Demeanour provided a good service. Almost immediate response to messages, fast packaging, fast shipping, good stealth. Product looks good and it on weight but I am yet to try it out. My order turns out to be a freebie too as the cancellation refunded what I had originally paid. Can&#039;t complain about that - everyone loves a freebie!!<br /><br />Miss Demeanour - I apologise for leaving a 1/5 rating after my order was cancelled. If I could update this now to 5/5, I would happily do it. I now have full faith in your service and will be back again for business soon :) ...I really do hope that you turn out to be one of the trustworthy vendors on SR and stick around for a long time.<br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s good news! glad to hear your order came thru and its a bonus u got it for free! She should be getting lots of apologizes now from some sheepish people I reckon.<br />I placed an order on the 8th &amp; it was shipped on the 9th apparently. It hasn&#039;t arrived yet but should be here &quot;any day now&quot;. I feel very confident its gonna arrive now that other orders are coming in. <br />Mine seems to be a little slow tho, 17 days today...what I was never gonna do was call her a scammer or LE when it hadn&#039;t arrived after 1 week. I have decided to be patient and try to be disciplined and refrain from losing the plot and make myself look like a dick by calling her out. <br />Those people that were spouting off at MD aren&#039;t gonna get to use her services now, too bad, but more for the rest of us!&nbsp; ;D

				I should have seen this coming but i placed an order with MD on the 1st of Sep. They said I could FE after they provided my tracking number, stupidly i only waited a half day and FE&#039;d without the number because I felt they were legit. I ordered GXG tracking (3 days guaranteed). 8 days later no tracking number, no package and no answer to any of my messages (all my messages remain unread).<br /><br />&nbsp;DO NOT ORDER FROM Miss Demeanor!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This is a warning to anybody whom is considering it.<br /><br />Maybe some orders do get sent but they are the bait. SCAMMER.<br /><br />(If it turns out MD is not a scammer I will remove this post and repost a full apology)
