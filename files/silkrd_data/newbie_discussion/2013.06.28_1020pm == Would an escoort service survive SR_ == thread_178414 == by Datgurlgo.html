				Well if you have a huge network of hookers in a major city you could just dispatch them to the address of the customer and you&#039;d still remain kinda anonymous if the hookers don&#039;t know who you are.

				LOL....thanks for the response just seeing what the pool would be like.&nbsp; I mean you come here to buy drugs and other&nbsp; illegal things.&nbsp; How could the oldest profession not survive?&nbsp; I mean most of the guys or sprawling redbook, backpacge and craigslist, trying to have some anonymity but end up with second hand, drug abused service.&nbsp; I mean seriously ( not in the mood for asshole) if there was a way for you to discreetly arrange your dates with an elite quality provider via SR would you.&nbsp; If its too much to post on the forum send me a private message.&nbsp; I am an entrepreneur and I saw a market that wasnt tapped into on SR just seeing if it had any viability.&nbsp; I mean we vendors are here to provide you with the services that you cant pick up the phone and order.&nbsp; Let me know

				The Silk Road isn&#039;t a localized service.&nbsp; Unless you had hookers in every city in America, you&#039;d either have a lot of disappointed users, or no traffic at all because barely anybody in your town will probably be looking for that kind of action here.

				IF I applied SR as the Stroll...then yes I would need a hooker in every city, but elite service girls never provide same day service.&nbsp; Same day service is for backpage, redbook and craigslist.&nbsp; Pre-booked quality service is what would be offered.&nbsp; And of course you FE upon the companions arrival.&nbsp; The typical scenarios Im envisioning is a client getting ready to take a trip and would like to have some fun while away.&nbsp; They send a private message about cities nearby there destination and inquire about services that can be provided.&nbsp; If they want to book they place an order.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sounds simple, but Im wondering why hasnt anyone tapped into this yet.&nbsp; If I dont ge any super negative opinions about it than I&#039;m going to give it a shot.&nbsp; I think its a great idea, personally.

				Bitch what happens when you run out of hookers to fill all the orders you get in a timely fashion, and end up tying up everybody&#039;s bitcoins because you only have 10 hoes trying to fill 20 new orders a day?

				There are one or two from Germany and a few other places. There was one person selling a list of hookers. Maybe if you instead sold listings your would be better off.

I would guess the same reasons that most folks dont use the services of escorts are.....lack of local supply/options, concerns of LE action IRL, need for privacy/discretion, etc..<br /><br />BUT-- i feel that, as with most typical growing and thriving industry, the competition in this online format has ultimately created a higher quality product, more &quot;professional&quot; suppliers, and in most cases a wholly &quot;better&quot; buying experience than IRL. All things that would make your offering very attractive.<br /><br />As noted by others, the area that would seem to immediately have issues, in this business model, is the supply side.<br />&nbsp;I cant imagine that you or any other vendor would have the network needed to &quot;satisfy&quot; all the potential orders from around the country..<br />&nbsp;A major difference between the escort&nbsp; business and the others on here, is that your &quot;product&quot; would have to be almost local to the buyers, otherwise the cost would be so high to make it unobtainable.<br /><br />BUT--if you could make it work, holy shit...instant money machine. <br />It was not long after i figured all this Tor, SR, bitcoin stuff out and could finally get on the site and find the &quot;candy-store&quot; things i always wanted, i smade more than one search for &quot;escorts&quot; &quot;prostitutes&quot; &quot;adult services&quot; etc...and was disappointed nothing was available. <br />There is certainly a market for what your selling.<br /><br />Oh, by the way--as most new vendors offer free samples to get their feedback and stats up, i suggest you might want to do the same---<br />Please feel free to send me a sample or two as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp;I humbly offer my services as an experienced, yet unbiased reviewer for your goods and services. Someone has to do it.<br />

It&#039;d be similar to vendors that only ship domestic, just on a smaller, sporadic scale. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;d like to add that an &quot;escoort&quot; service probably wouldn&#039;t survive, however, there&#039;s a chance that an &quot;escort&quot; service would.

				if you have escorts in multiple cities, it could work if buyers didn&#039;t care about having more anonymity. would be a small market if its just in one city

				I think it would be a novel idea, if you could get everything organized, with planned service and FE procedure, etc.<br /><br />However, correct me if I&#039;m wrong here, but couldn&#039;t LE buy your listings and systematically arrest all your hookers?<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m missing something here....

I would guess the same reasons that most folks dont use the services of escorts are.....lack of local supply/options, concerns of LE action IRL, need for privacy/discretion, etc..<br /><br />BUT-- i feel that, as with most typical growing and thriving industry, the competition in this online format has ultimately created a higher quality product, more &quot;professional&quot; suppliers, and in most cases a wholly &quot;better&quot; buying experience than IRL. All things that would make your offering very attractive.<br /><br />As noted by others, the area that would seem to immediately have issues, in this business model, is the supply side.<br />&nbsp;I cant imagine that you or any other vendor would have the network needed to &quot;satisfy&quot; all the potential orders from around the country..<br />&nbsp;A major difference between the escort&nbsp; business and the others on here, is that your &quot;product&quot; would have to be almost local to the buyers, otherwise the cost would be so high to make it unobtainable.<br /><br />BUT--if you could make it work, holy shit...instant money machine. <br />It was not long after i figured all this Tor, SR, bitcoin stuff out and could finally get on the site and find the &quot;candy-store&quot; things i always wanted, i smade more than one search for &quot;escorts&quot; &quot;prostitutes&quot; &quot;adult services&quot; etc...and was disappointed nothing was available. <br />There is certainly a market for what your selling.<br /><br />Oh, by the way--as most new vendors offer free samples to get their feedback and stats up, i suggest you might want to do the same---<br />Please feel free to send me a sample or two as soon as possible.<br />&nbsp;I humbly offer my services as an experienced, yet unbiased reviewer for your goods and services.

				Funny enough, there are forums structured for the escort world just like SR. Go to (clearnet) usasexguide.info. It&#039;s a nationwide forum that discusses reviews of all types of sex services (street walkers, backpages, massage parlors, etc.) and these guys review how they were and what type of service to expect. The stories they tell are pretty hilarious and it&#039;s fun to read just for kicks. But if you&#039;re interested and finding action in your town, they give quite detailed descriptions on where to go. Check it out and you would probably have better luck putting your services out on that site than here In my opinion. <br /><br />-peace
