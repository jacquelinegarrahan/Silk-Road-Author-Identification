				Most important thing here is to have a good sound system that will make you feel sound even when you&#039;re sober. It doesn&#039;t have to be too fancy I use my car which has only 1 12&quot; kicker L5 attached to a 500 watt rms sub d amp and with all aftermarket interior speakers recieving ~100 watts rms each from a 4-way amp.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t access to such a system, the second best option is a high quality set of cans. :D<br /><br />Instructions: It&#039;s probably a good idea to have tell a buddy what to do in the event that you are tripping too hard to remember what to do next. Take a heavy dose of lsd- 250 mics at least. I like 500 or more personally. But then I do enjoy going super deep. The more the merrier. Wait a few hours until you&#039;re peaking. Then smoke a bowl or two of quality herb (sativa or a sativa dominant strain works best). This is the point where a buddy might have to step in because you should be at that point where planning goes out the window and trying to find anything, especially a song on your device, or even the name of the song you&#039;re looking for should be almost impossible to do. Now, play the song called &quot;Relocation&quot; by Feed Me that you can find in their album aptly named &quot;Escape from Electric Mountain&quot; album.<br /><br />Observed results: I&#039;ve blasted through time and space and lost all sense of reality while I was simultaneously being ripped apart cell by cell, atom by atom, with each atom being enveloped in waves of euphoria. That&#039;s me though, but since my discovery, I have made all of my friends experience this song and I have seen them cry with happiness, squirm and jump with joy, and even the most atheist of them made remarks that would have made any passing stranger think that they were having a life-changing religious experience. Results may vary, but everyone that has done everything as described above has said things like &quot;oh my God,&quot; and &quot;holy shit.&quot; Afterwards, you will understand what Feed Me meant when he once stated, &quot;I don&#039;t even make music anymore.&quot; Trust me, It will be worth your time.<br /><br />Title: Relocation<br />Album: Escape from Electric Mountain<br />Artist: Feed Me

				First LSD trip i accidentally watched Squirel Nut Zippers: &quot;The Ghost of Stephen Foster&quot; video on youtube. I&nbsp; was so mesmerized and kept watching it again and again, thinking this video was *made* for this.

				I&#039;ve recently gotten into female vocal chillstep. Quite a big fan of Blackmill dubstep remix of &quot;Your song&quot; by Ellie Goulding. anything by Ellie Goulding in general is quite relaxing to listen to when high.

				The other day, i was quite fucked up on MXE and synthetic Cannabinoids at my friend&#039;s and i had musical orgasms during the second part of this song:<br />Song: House Of Balloons / Glass Table Girls<br />Artist: The Weeknd<br />Album: House of Balloons<br />Genre: RnB<br /><br />While on 25B-NBOME, i had a wonderful musical encounter, i listened to two of the mixes from Physical Therapy named: &#039;&#039;Hot Yoga Mix&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Therapy Sessions Vol. 1&#039;&#039;. He became one of my favorite artists instantly. I can&#039;t really describe the genre, just try it if you wish: http://sheneedstherapy.net/<br />Also, try his song &#039;&#039;Drone On (feat. Jamie Krasner)&#039;&#039;, it&#039;s pretty good imo.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t do MDMA in years, but i&#039;m a huge fan of Unicorn Kid since the early 8-bit tracks and the music he does now blows me away more than ever, it makes me euphoric and dancy even though i&#039;m really not the kind of person who dances. Anyway, all his latest stuff is on soundcloud and i would definitely listen to all of it if i was to do MDMA again. If you&#039;re into very cheesy trance, you should really listen to his mix for SUPERSUPER MAGAZINE called &#039;&#039;Tokyo 1999&#039;&#039;.
