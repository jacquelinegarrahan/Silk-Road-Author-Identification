				Are you sure what your sniffing is cocaine or at least only cocaine? We notice a lot of people getting turned off coke before they have even tried the real deal. All the cuts people are using is giving cocaine a bad name its the most fun drug in the world if you use the real stuff.

				No it was pretty decent, didn&#039;t get it off the road.&nbsp; I say its getting old because I almost developed a real bad problem when I was younger, luckily I was able to get it under control.&nbsp; I know how much fun it could be, I think I just need to stay away for a awhile.&nbsp; Truthfully if I had some side dishes to go with it, some alcohol and sleeping pills, it would not have been too bad a morning.&nbsp; Just me being unprepared!

				I have not had the pleasure of trying LSD, I have 25i on the way, but I may just sell it and go the LSD route.&nbsp; I was previously a little scared, but now I can&#039;t wait to get my hands on that lysergic acid!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				You should defiantly hold on to that 25i. Its a good drug, just keep it till the L comes in. Eat the L first and wait a week to take the 25. You should exp L 1st before any RC&#039;s.<br /><br />Last drug I took was some L. It was actually off SR, but a buddy of mine ordered it so IDK which vendor its from. I do suspect it had another chemical in it as well due to it being bitter. My friend told me he thought it was from the ink on the blotter.

				No problem. I&#039;ve had a really strong life changing experience on 25i before. I&#039;ve also had mehish exp&#039;s. It really depends on how pure the sample is.<br /><br />There&#039;s dirty acid out there and there&#039;s clean too. Same with all psychedelics. If its pure enough, and if its a good drug from the start its worth taking. Things like 5-meo-amt are not worth taking. My sample of that was clean i&#039;m sure. Its just a bad headache ridden chem!

				Hass, apparently it is best to subject yourself to extreme heat while on clen/tren/coke, for the best muscle fibra absorption.
