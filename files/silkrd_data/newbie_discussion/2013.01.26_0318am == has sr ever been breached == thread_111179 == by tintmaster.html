				Yes, there was an SQL injection attack not too long ago - the &quot;SR Quickbuy Scam.&quot; In addition, the site has fallen to DDOS-like attacks for days at a time on a couple of occasions now. There&#039;s no way of knowing if these attacks advanced any further though. Most worrying of all perhaps is the attacks/breaches we will never hear about - and it would be foolish to say that such an event is impossible.<br /><br />All of this should be of little worry to you, however, if you are encrypting your information! Excluding the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack, PGP encryption means SR won&#039;t be able to read or store your personal info. Moral of the story: join the PGP club if you haven&#039;t already done so!

				Just assume it is compromised/cracked. <br />Encrypt your personal info. <br />Don&#039;t reveal anything too personal. <br />Don&#039;t use ridiculous passwords.<br />Don&#039;t keep more BTC on SR (or any e-wallet) than you can afford to lose.<br />Then it won&#039;t really matter if it all disappears tomorrow.

				I understood that what appeared to be DOS attacks preventing users accessing SR was actually a large influx of new users and that the particular problem has now been solved ? One can only imagine what an attractive honeypot SR is to hackers however and that they will not stop trying to gain access..
