				One of SR&#039;s most popular Novelty card makers has appeared to have gone scammer. Removed all his listings, went hidden, and sent the last several people who ordered from him cards with a sticker on them of the actual card, or incomplete/problem cards.<br /><br />Maybe someone else can post this on the Rumor Mill board as I don&#039;t have enough posts, sad to see him go especially to go out this way.

				What do you mean what am I talking about do you have a hard time comprehending english. A vendor from SR who has been selling ID cards on here for almost 2 years APPEARS to have finally went scammer. <br /><br />Is that clear enough for you? If you don&#039;t know who he is why would you bother posting the topic.

I then read his main page and you can see that he stated he removed listings to catch up and will be back after the weekend. <br /><br />Don&#039;t post shit like this until your sure whats going on you fucking moron.
