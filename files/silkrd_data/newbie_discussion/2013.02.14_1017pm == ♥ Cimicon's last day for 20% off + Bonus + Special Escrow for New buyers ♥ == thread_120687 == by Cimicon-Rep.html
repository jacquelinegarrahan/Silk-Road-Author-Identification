We&#039;re doing things differently. We&#039;re aiming to improve our ratings.

				Undeniable and true. Our present rating and feedback is without question, atrocious. Things should never have come to what lead to our well deserved low rating. We were new to Silk Road. We didn&#039;t anticipate nor properly prepare for the volume of orders we would achieve in such a short period of time. Our staff was inexperienced and had difficulty navigating the daily operations demanded of a seller/vendor on the Silk Road. We inadvertently supplied some with inferior products which amounted to misrepresentation. We made promises we couldn&#039;t keep. We employed the services of some unreliable vendors to supply us with what we were told was quality product and we relied on a few of their promises which went unfulfilled.<br /><br />In a word, we really didn&#039;t know what we were doing and we weren&#039;t ready. But we&#039;ve brought on experienced staff members, restructured and reorganized our operations and obtained well regard suppliers of the high quality products we now sell and our customers deserve. We manage our inventory better. We improved our shipping methods. Our acquisitions team vets any potential new supplier and we test for quality. But most importantly and perhaps where we lacked the most experience in was in the area of vendor/client communications. Our communications with our customers left much to be desired. Very much to be desired. And this is the area where we are dedicating a significant portion of our time and energy towards improving.&nbsp; <br /><br />With such low ratings and poor feedback, we could have closed up shop and started a new vendor account. This is an anonymous marketplace after all. But we instead are taking ownership of our past mistakes and are working hard to regain trust and to meet the expectations that Silk Road buyers deserve. <br /><br />Give us a chance to prove ourselves. We are ready, willing, and able to serve this community to the best of our ability and are seeking to redress and correct past wrongs committed by us against former clients. We are... going to do the right thing. Because the right thing isn&#039;t just a moral imperative, it benefits us all as a people who&#039;ve come together to obtain what those in power would keep us from having and criminalizing us for wanting to take the edge off life or to medicate ourselves as we see fit.<br /><br />It is our right. And we will do our part to help you, the Silk Road community, maintain and exercise that right.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />If you would like to know more about is and read some of the things we&#039;ve done to turn ourselves around, see our Customer Service Thread found here: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119440.msg806843#msg806843

				Yet we don&#039;t deny our past mistakes. How can we? But know this, that every negative feedback you see in our profile will be and are being addressed and properly taken care of. Should you take a chance or wait until I feedback improves? That is your decision to make based on your tolerance for risk, your judgement of our current character, our effort devoted to doing what is right and our open honesty. <br /><br />I do not blame you for not wanting to take a chance. But I will say this, do be careful out there. Some vendor feedback isn&#039;t what it seems. Click the item link next to the feedback to see what was purchased. Plus if you&#039;re a new buyer with low stats, most of the well established sellers/vendors will not allow you use escrow but will require that you finalize early (FE). Plus some long time vendors may be looking to get out of the business - you can sometimes tell if you see that they require everyone (FE). The biggest scam in SR history was committed this way by a &quot;trusted&quot; vendor named Tony76. He had a super sale where he required everyone finalize early before shipping. <br /><br />He walked away with hundreds of thousands of dollars be some estimates.

But the good news is that it doesn;t affect participation on the Silk Road marketplace. There, you just have to worry about vendors requiring you to finalize early (pay up front) before they will ship your order if you have low buyer stats. Generally below 10-15 purchases and/or totaling less than $300 spent on SR. <br /><br />One hurdle after the other.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s hard to say which vendors accept new, low stat buyers. It depends on what you are looking for. There are a lot of vendors and the majority do not do escrow with new, low stat buyers. You have to read each vendor&#039;s profile page which lists their terms. <br /><br />Sometimes, if you PM a vendor beforehand and ask them to allow you to do an in escrow purchase, they may allow it. It depends on the amount. The lower the amount and the less busy they are, the more likely they might be in the mood. All depends on how you approach them.

The feedback concerning FE with no product, you will see changed soon. Why? What it is is that we made them FE for product that we did not have enough stock in and then had the nerve to try to make them wait while we get more stock&nbsp; in to fill their order. Doing that was as bad as having poor communication and inferior product. The failure on our part was a 100% complete failure that any vendor could ever commit.<br /><br />The fix, however, is reasonable when you think about it. Have a look at our store and our sale. It grants escrow to all new buyers with low stats. It only limits the order size. This ensures that we only sell them what is in stock and ensures that they will get the service and full protection that SR was meant to offer.&nbsp;

So they started demanding low stat, new buyers to <br />finalize early (FE) - which is to say, pay up front before shipping orders. Other sellers saw the risk reward ratio was in their favor and<br />started to do the same thing. Now, the majority of seller require FE from new buyers. <br /><br />You say that you never had to FE, then as a service to the community, you should list the sellers who do not demand FE from new buyers. <br />It would save buyers many hours of research considering how slow TOR can be. Just look into your SR account, click account link and down<br />on the right side, you can see a link to feedback. This will show all the feedback you left vendors and will show which vendors dealt with that<br />didn&#039;t require you to FE. You can even post direct links to their seller profile page. <br /><br />That would be tremendously helpful to the community. But also consider that your drug(s) of choice might not be another, so be sure to list what<br />the vendor sells. <br /><br />:)
