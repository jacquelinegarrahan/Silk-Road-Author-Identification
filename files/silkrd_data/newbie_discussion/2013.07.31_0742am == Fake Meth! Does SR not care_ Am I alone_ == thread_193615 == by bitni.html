				Is this allowed by SR? My short time here and I have received 6 shipments 4 of which appear to have no actual meth at all. 1 would keep me up if I smoked it every 5 min while the other had a nice euphoric feeling but would ware off after about an hour. I still have 9+ grams of this crap and will until I dispose of it. Is this just accepted behavior here? Do people think this is real? Why all the positive feedbacks. Why is the free market not working? Will the SR staff believe a new buyer that claims that top sellers are&nbsp; selling a fake product?

				Maybe it was weak meth? I wouldn&#039;t jump to conclusions with just speculation. I would somehow get it tested and if it comes out as something other than meth, then you can go and leave negative feedback. Anyway, good luck man. Hope it wasn&#039;t fake shit. That would be a real disappointment to see someone selling fake shit here.

				No, a lot of people including me, have noticed a lot of &quot;cut&quot; shit going around.<br />One made me so sick, I thought I was dying. <br /><br />Does SR care? No, I suspect not. &quot;IT&quot; is not really any one person, or group of people. I mean who really knows what&#039;s what? <br />They allow Cyanide to be sold.

I&#039;m no expert, but I believe it&#039;s used to make Barbiturates. <br />

				Yeah unfortunately it&#039;s not very helpful to accuse a random vendor of selling fake shit when you won&#039;t tell us which one. If you really believe that you&#039;ve been given fake shit, contact the vendor and see what they say about it and if they are willing to do anything for you. If not, make a post on here/leave shitty feedback on their page. One of the realities of the free market is that not everything available is good quality or even what vendors claim it to be, but it&#039;s our job as users of the market to spread that information and talk to the vendors about it.

				One vendor did go above and beyond to make it right including refunding my money and re-shipping the product which was the same quality and just sitting stashed next to the first one he sent. That was 2 of the received packages. I was happy with the outcome of my situation but I&#039;m sure others have not spoken up or don&#039;t know any better. That is why I am posting here, because I care. In order for the free market &quot;libertarian&quot; way to work then the buyer needs to be informed. The other top vendor, I am currently talking to about the problem. I&#039;ll say HT has lower quality meth right now, I don&#039;t plan on returning but left positive feedback and finalized because it did contain some meth and some of it was decent and didn&#039;t leave me hungry, tired, disoriented and with a headache. The Dope Spot is by far the best quality I have had on SR, even had a euphoric feeling and I would probably order from him again. UnlimitedLife has better quality than the 2 top vendors that sold this fake meth but so far seems very low quality. I can handle low quality meth, shit happens but shipping 100% ISO is disturbing to me and is a scam imo. I never asked what I can do about this I asked if I was alone or are there others and hopefully can raise some questions from potential buyers. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193615.msg1396700#msg1396700">Quote from: BenZoKingVendor on July 31, 2013, 09:54 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IF you ordered meth from the same vendor 6 times and you claim 4 were fake your either scamming or not very bright.

				It dont matter where you buy ya meth from anymore its much the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;You only have to read the forums here to see the amount of discussion on whats the best cutters to use and how to do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The more middle men that it go&#039;s through the more it becomes cutters.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway this is the game we play so either you like it or move onto something else or even give drugs up all together.&nbsp; lol

				Before June all I knew was msm as a cutting agent. Burn off and cool with a wet rag and repeat and you are left with a fat bowl. Maybe everywhere on SR its shit but there is biker dope here. Anhidrous and red fred is available frequently here.&nbsp; When I first ordered here I was thinking I found the answer to my problems. Waiting on a local dealer to show up and dealing with ppl I would rather not. That is no longer a problem for me after this experience. All this fake shit comes from the same coast it seems. If I had the funds I would make it my duty to bring it to the road but I&#039;m not willing to take the risk either. Does coke here have the same problem? What about MDMA? I am ready to pull btc and get out of this. Better odds in vegas. I don&#039;t understand why the vendors get away with this quality. Its a shame that I will just be written off as a scammer or a bad customer/SR noob when people are getting ripped off. I hope at least one person reads this and thinks before accepting it as quality. Right now almost every pic is n-iso. Clowdy white shit in these weird looking huge shards. If it wasn&#039;t for unlimited life&#039;s .5g I would not have made it through the day. The dope spot and unlimitedlife are the only 2 that dont have un-meth. Quality need improvement but it does the trick. Hammer time also is OK. I need to dip into that sack some more with a clean pipe b4 I can decide. I guess this post it brought to you under the influence of unlimitedlifes gear. Maybe I&#039;ll get to 50 and can start shaking things up the way they need to be.

				Ok.&nbsp; So here is my experience and my &quot;2 cents worth&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been getting some decent crystal up here in northern CA and then it seemed to dry up and then this &quot;looks like meth&quot;, &quot;smells like meth&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;kinda sorta burns like meth&quot;,&nbsp; stuff started to pop up.&nbsp; So after being disappointed several (more than several) times I decided to try the SR venue.&nbsp; I liked the fact that I could be discreet and not deal with going out and waiting for my guy (who was late 8 out of 10 times)...&nbsp; So I did my homework and checked all the forums to see who was getting the best feedback and happy buyers.&nbsp; I did the whole coin wallet thing and finally last week I ordered a 4 gram ball from The Dope Spot.&nbsp; I was going to go to Kush but he disappeared for a few days just when my bit coins were released.&nbsp; But TDS got good feedback so I felt good about trying out his wares.&nbsp; In the few days I waited I ate good, drank Gatorade, took vitamins,&nbsp; and got rested.&nbsp; I was ready when it arrived to begin my marathon.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now let me say this I grew up in Philly and was in my teens in the 1970&#039;s,&nbsp; I got greenish gray biker speed called crank from the Pagans MC.&nbsp; That shit was good.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t pretty, but you would see guys working on their cars at 3am and bikers tearing apart their motors in&nbsp; their living room!&nbsp; It was not unusual to decide the brand new vacuum cleaner needed to be rewired (coz you could do it better) and to do just that!!!&nbsp; It took a few days before you would even begin to think you were getting tired.&nbsp; Ok so fast forward and new processes are developed and the Crystal came into being.&nbsp; The original was ephedrine, iodine crystals, and Red.&nbsp; It took a bit of know how (and fucking guts) to not blow yourself up but if you had a good cook it was the bomb, and not as ugly as the crank was.&nbsp; Now they have shortened the process and it can be done in a damn 2 liter bottle with the &quot;shake and bake&quot; method.&nbsp; But these are not the problems because there was always a chance that a batch would be out there that wasn&#039;t as good as it should be due to many variables and so we knew it was part of the game.&nbsp; The real problem is this cut that they have begun to use.&nbsp; It is virtually impossible to remove it and unlike the old days it is sold in head shops right there at the same place you are buying your pizo!!&nbsp; The stuff I got from TDS has lots of really good meth in it, but it also has this cut.&nbsp; Even though it comes in one chunk it still has been cut with these new chemicals and then re-crystallized and it is a bit disappointing.&nbsp; I am in my late 40&#039;s and it makes me sad to think some guys never even got to experience the real &quot;rewire the vacuum&quot; high and think all the jittery, head spin stuff is what Meth is supposed to be!&nbsp; I got the 4grms and it was over weight, delivered fast, and yes it does the trick; however the first day after a prep of rest and food should be where you are cruising, not feeling jittery, or headaches, or beginning to see &quot;ninjas&quot;!&nbsp; That is like the 3rd-4th day shit.&nbsp; So I would really like to know is there anybody at SR that is going to sell the uncut meth?&nbsp; This 4 gram ball has real meth in it I can see just in the pipe what is real behavior and what is the cut.&nbsp; The cut leaves a thin splotchy film on the top of the pizo, and it runs from the heat.&nbsp; The meth stays clear unless you overheaqt it and it slowly makes a coating that has no splotchy look.&nbsp; But the thing that I don&#039;t understand is you got the buyers and the price is good why let your supplier give you this stuff that is 80% fucking bomb??&nbsp; I am a bit disappointed but perhaps this will just keep on happening until we show that we don&#039;t want it.&nbsp; Do I have to buy from Australia? Or Korea? I will pay the price.&nbsp; I just want the real uncut thing...period!&nbsp; &nbsp;As I said the TDS stuff got me there but it just is not as pure as I had anticipated and expected, he cannot do more to get us the product.&nbsp; The price, service, quantity, communication, and delivery were all spot on.&nbsp; It is the greedy middlemen who are using this cut who are to to blame.&nbsp; I thought it would not be an issue on SR.&nbsp; Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware) always.&nbsp; The stores selling the cut need to be boycotted, they are the most guilty in my eyes.&nbsp; The sellers are taking a great deal of risk and have to be perfect and flawless every time to stay free.&nbsp; They need to tell their supplier not to give them this shit because their reputation is valuable to them.&nbsp; It used to be back in the 1990-2000&#039;s that you just heat it and blow through the pizo and the cut would burn off and then you had the real shit left to enjoy, but now it is a bitch.&nbsp; I should not be seeing ninjas and feeling headache with jitters on the first day.&nbsp; I should be painting the god damn house ! LOL.....&nbsp; that&#039;s my 2 cents...thank you.

				Thank you changedlife, you echo my sentiments exactly and this view I believe is becoming more popular as I have heard others mention it on SR as well.&nbsp; We just want meth, real honest to god pure (or close to pure as you can get) meth.&nbsp; I and others have voiced that we would pay double to get a real quality product.&nbsp; I myself am quite new to meth but I have lots of experience with other drugs and I&#039;ve got a rough idea of what meth should be like based on reading and smoking SR crap.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had the headaches that 800mg of ibuprofen won&#039;t touch, I&#039;ve felt like my heart would beat out of my chest and I&#039;ve felt my heartbeat not change one bit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve smoked a bowl of 30+ monster hits and only gotten the slightest tingling buzz.&nbsp; I&#039;ve slept well at night, eaten full meals, been engulfed in so much sweat that you&#039;d think I just gotten out of the shower (then go on an hour later to soak the bed with sweat, then be dripping wet the next day at work having coworkers asking me what&#039;s wrong).&nbsp; I&#039;ve felt dizzy enough to fall down, sick enough that I thought I&#039;d die (and wished I would), confused enough that I could not focus, horny but could not get off, buzzes lasting 10min to an hour leading me to compulsively redose both snorting and smoking at the same time.&nbsp; It just goes on and on.&nbsp; I just want meth that is going to make me cry when I snort it, is so potent I need only a few pipe blasts to get off, lasts 6+ hours from a single dose (I&#039;ll even settle for 4+), doesn&#039;t leave brown residue in my pipe (I don&#039;t burn my shit either), tastes &quot;right&quot; when smoked or tasted/eaten, makes me forget the words hunger and sleep exists, makes me ridiculously euphoric, gives me a rush from a pipe blast, and gives me the sexual desire and performance of a 22 year old guy over and over again and gives me the concentration and focus of a schoolboy super dosed on Adderall or Ritalin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried two big name vendors (First Class Fix and Kush411) and they both fell short of this ideal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know maybe I&#039;m asking and expecting too much from meth.&nbsp; But, I thought meth was supposed to be the best, most addictive drug there is, and so far it don&#039;t seem that is so.&nbsp; I agree with you changed life, for me so far the dope spot has had the best.&nbsp; Not that it is the best but that it is closest to my ideal that I have found so far.&nbsp; As you mentioned, it does have it&#039;s shortcomings though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had two of his batches, my first on SR a 0.3 bag that was all shake and small crystals but it seemed very good to me but I was dizzy, had tachycardia, stomach cramps (but those are standard meth side effects aren&#039;t they?).&nbsp; However, it tasted good when smoked, was very salty when eaten/tasted, and left no residue when burned and did not require much smoking to get high.&nbsp; Also it gave a rush when smoked (head rush and sounded like thunder in my ears) or even snorted.&nbsp; The second batch, a 4 gram ball was quite different.&nbsp; In fact, I think the bag had 2 different things in it.&nbsp; First was the shake.&nbsp; Tasted super foul chemical when eaten/tasted.&nbsp; Smoke was chemically tasting.&nbsp; Left lots of brown residue.&nbsp; Cracked back and melted into a yellowish color.&nbsp; 30+ pipe blasts didn&#039;t do a whole lot.&nbsp; But, when I got to the crystal, it was different.&nbsp; It had the same bad chemical taste when eaten/tasted but it also had a salty component.&nbsp; It melted into an amber liquid, though at times, it &quot;ran from the lighter&quot;.&nbsp; It left a brown residue, but much much less than the shake.&nbsp; Also, the burn from snorting was only about half as bad as I&#039;ve usually experienced and I got no rush from snorting (fairly big lines for meth) or smoking.&nbsp; Nonetheless I kept at it for several days and I did eventually get quite high, at one point almost throbbing euphoric, but I also started seeing flashes of white light, purple and green circles rotating on my walls, hearing sirens, and developed a very nasty paranoia (which I guess points to the meth&#039;s potency, that it could cause psychosis, but I would also kind of expect that to happen after 3+ days and 2.5-3grams used with no sleep/food/breaks).&nbsp; By the way, I&#039;m fine now, the hallucinations and paranoia wore off after a couple of days, the hallucinations quickly and the paranoia lingering a couple days and slowly trailing off.&nbsp; What is my answer to this lower quality meth?&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting for a savior, someone who will come with a reincarnation of what meth should be taking SR by storm and raising the standards to the point that other vendors will have to start offering better gear if they hope to compete.&nbsp; So far, I hear panoramic is up a coming but isn&#039;t currently listing, tigerrush made a strong initial showing but has not since made any offers, and finally WarBeast.&nbsp; &nbsp;Currently I&#039;m putting all bets on the Beast and I hope he lives up to his name and rapidly rising reputation.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope so cause I&#039;ve got a trial of 2gs of the Beasts best (that is, batch #2) coming tomorrow.&nbsp; Good luck to all of you in finding your holy grail.

				hahaha just stick to speed it will keep you up and not do your head in as bad lol 8)<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Is the speed on the road good?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />It varies quite a lot, from all I&#039;ve experienced and read, but seemingly more consistent than the meth. I find that buying any stimulants on the road is way more of a crap shoot than most other drugs and the quality is damn near impossible to predict, even with repeat orders from the best sellers. I can however enthusiastically recommend these: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/48bdf1e493.&nbsp; Mrouid is possibly the best seller on SR (top 1% with perfect feedback) and these pills are one of the most popular speed products for good reason. Strong enough, consistent, very clean, and a damn good deal in bulk!&nbsp;

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I came up on the Scarfo crew&#039;s P2P crank of the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s. It was everywhere and really cheap. We only banged it (IV) and had stuff that was opaque white but very dense and solid - you wouldn&#039;t want to handle it allot your fingers would turn black from touching it (wtf were we pumping in our veins back then?)&nbsp; you would mix a rock&nbsp; with 20 units of water and it would come back 70. One shot would set you off for days..somewhere in this thread someone mentioned the all night body shop or mechanics/garage tweakers. Survivor right there man. <br />&nbsp; So after a 25 year absence and some late night&nbsp; checking out of all the drug porn I figure why not give this ice a try. With no works my new method has been snorting.Believe it or not my little quarter t purchase gave me 3 Fri-Sun weekends with little sleep.This was my first night back since 1987 and on two small lines I felt very rushy and the stuff gave me all those flash back feelings and a 48 hour ride on about .1&nbsp; I did sweat and have some jaw gurn and it was limp dickish and I was confused because maybe it was me but it did feel very MDMA like in a way or maybe those half g bombs in the 90&#039;s that have something to do with that&nbsp; Either way I found this new way of synthesizing to be stronger but some how colder. It felt more mechanical and had side effects I attribute to old age and other chem after effects. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I saw the Warbeast offering intro grams at class of 70&#039;s pricing I could not resist. Did a little line tester and now this was very close to the old school stuff from back in the day that when you banged a chick with it she would just gush cum. The old wanna be pimp turn out trick. I can remember my buddy back in the day saying this stuff is so good and had me so horny - me and the ol&#039; lady didn&#039;t use any porn at all last night.&nbsp; Maybe his new batch from the Beast is that kind of legend? I am still holding and reading some of the latest reports have me thinking I should stock pile.&nbsp; Seems to be a lot of hype in the forums- the 1st batch gave me that tingle in my balls and that old familiar I am a porn star&nbsp; hard on- That is the fucking dope I remember- out all night on the strange rotation then taking care of the regular at a moments notice no problem. There are some hidden gems on this road my friend , you just gotta keep an ear to the ground. I find this place almost too good to true!!Nothing fake here at all.

				Yes nosponser I am a Philly guy and we had the crank back in the day.&nbsp; one night after the Chez Pariz closed at 4AM in Atlantic city me and my home boy (now dead---fool decided to rob a bank!) we did a shot on the beach and waled from Atlantic City to Ventnor!!&nbsp; I know the process the Pagans MC used to make that dense green/gray/cream colored shit is long gone but you are correct....one night a girl I knew was all fucked up on Quaalude and I was spun...not a good match.&nbsp; I made her a shot and watched her go from groggy and stoned, to sucking my dick in 3 minutes flat!!&nbsp; Ahhh youth....&nbsp; &nbsp; I think the new process is capable of good highs coz when I was down in Riverside county (I. E. Inland Empire) the in the 2001-2004 time frame they had some fucking bomb gear and many nights I sat in the Indian Casino gambling on that gear.&nbsp; It was without all that jittery and headaches (hey turtle if you ate 3 squares, slept, and all that you definitely had some bunk)&nbsp; The gear I got from TDS was real meth in there for sure..if I had to guess I would say 25% cut....the problem is some middle man took some above decent shit and ruined it out of greed.&nbsp; But imo it just doesn&#039;t fit the professionalism I have experienced with my order and the many folks that put TDS in the top percent of righteous sellers.&nbsp; But we need to tell our vendors (I PM&#039;d TDS today and alerted him to my post coz I wanted him to know that I realize it is not him doing this to good fucking dope.)&nbsp; My advice is this, if you feel your vendor is a straight shooter just let them know your concerns...hopefully next time the sellers supplier tries to give him some gear that is cut he will tell them to sell that shit to the street vendors.&nbsp; Here on SR we pay the premium prices for many different reason, but the bottom line is I would rather pay more or get less if it is without this nasty cut.&nbsp; funny story, back in the day they ALWAYS cut coke with Italian Baby Laxative....to this day when ever I do a line of coke I got to shit right away LOL....&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Well TDS just PM&#039;d me and as I anticipated he is a true gentlemen.&nbsp; Explained that his last batch was not from his usual channel.&nbsp; Thanked me for being understanding, assured me that i will be taken care of next time and, as I surmised,&nbsp; he realized it too late that the gear was sub-par.&nbsp; I could tell he was shocked when he read the unusual unhappy comments for his store.&nbsp; I am so impressed how professional and courteous the communication has been so you can rest assured i will be going back to TDS.&nbsp; And in my opinion he is one of the best Meth sellers on SR.&nbsp; He cares about his reputation and his customers.&nbsp;

				the great thing about silk is there is a great variety of vendors i dont touch meth but if you think you&#039;ve been scammed resolve and if nothing is done u can leave bad feedback and look elsewhere until you find a reliable dealer with a good product i understand you feel conned but there are also alot of scam buyers out there and admin has to take this into consideration especially when dealing with experienced vendors and new customers<br />Best of luck mate <br />LONG LIVE SR

				My experience has been mostly good.&nbsp; Nowadays, with a new vendor I use Marquis reagent which at least can tell you whether the product contains something genuine, although it wont tell you purity.&nbsp; You can get a box of &#039;em from amazon pretty cheap.&nbsp; I generally IV, so I certainly want to make sure I didn&#039;t get anything completely bunk before sampling.&nbsp; Good shit via IV tends to leave a sweetish taste in the back of the throat and a muffled ear-popping/ringing sensation while it&#039;s coming up.&nbsp; Then later it&#039;s intense focus -- and a tendency to go on and on and on. See some of the above paragraphs, lol.<br /><br />Had great luck with CTM recently.&nbsp; HT and Kush have&nbsp; both been go-tos for a long time although they&#039;ve&nbsp; been scarce as of late. Several Months ago I had 2 orders with Chaletla; first was good, second was total horseshit.&nbsp; Never went back after that.

				Well I gave up meth completely after fighting with Kush about the same shit. He sent me 100% BS at first, apologized, said he knew what happened and resent. The resent pkg was mixed some of the same and some weak that would keep you up but had trouble making it past 24hrs. There is the same effect of no rush and the up feeling would last 1 -2 hrs but was not how meth makes you feel. Long story short, I no longer will order meth from SR. I have given up meth and just smoke weed now. SR has been great on the weed orders. <br /><br />TDS - Good (weak still) but the best on SR <br /><br />Kush411 - No good esp for the $$$$. He will send you shit if you are new or have any refunds. He used my&nbsp; previous refund with cheletla to not issue a refund and accused me of scamming. After back and fourth in resolution I got 50% btc back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheletla - Never order from this guy...His &quot;Fire&quot; is fake.<br /><br />UnlimitedLife - Garbage product do not waste time<br /><br />Hammertime - This was some weird tasting/smelling like fingernail polish and had no effects other than a Headache. <br /><br />

				you are not alone.&nbsp; I am posting quickly&nbsp; now after reading the first couple of posts that mirror my feelings.<br /><br />&nbsp;Changed life I believe is the posters screen name that cause me to stop and create this post so that it appears in my threads.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have very long post written . which I will post soon.. For now. I want to say/propose that I am going to somehow form a group and that group will work together to find and establish an exclusive pipeline to real quality meth. a consumer union if you will. I want to believe that&nbsp; Us old-timers working as a group can&nbsp; sweep this road clean of all the garbage being sold here. As a group working together we should be able to get the attention of vendors here who have contacts close or directly to the manufacturers. ( I am a bit surprised that I don&#039;t see hints of organized cartel or mafia groups other than European MDMA and Chinese M-1)<br /><br />I believe that an organized group here on the road can wield the power to make someone extremely successful in a very short period of time.<br /><br />I hope I can private message you guys in this thread. I don&#039;t have time to post more right now. But yeah!&nbsp; finally.. <br /><br />Its not me.. thank goodness. I have been slowly accepting that the glory days of mid to late seventies were long gone. my faith has been renewed.. I have found others who feel the same way I do. and not a minute too soon as I was just getting ready to reorder more coke ILO of what I really want and that is quality meth. thanks guys!!<br /><br />My head and thoughts are swirling on how to form this group, I know that I want this group to have membership criteria of a minimum age minimum years of use. I&#039;ll go out on a limb and say 40yr old minimum, 20years experience, multiple rehab stints, and or done time, married , kids , self employed&nbsp; ok ok getting a bit carried away here. Those that know what I am getting at should know what I am getting at here..&nbsp; Figuring out validation can be done a number of ways. ..... Keeping everyone anonymous is crucial in order to gain trust......&nbsp; think out loud...... errrrr thinking through a keyboard...&nbsp; hooray....&nbsp; i see light in this tunnel.!<br /><br />As I type this..... ah yep.... i am thinking that I&#039;ll put up a vendor account and message selected individuals to purchase thereby forming a select group. I can refund or actually send something.. d<br /><br />For now , I am out of time , and running late now but yeah!&nbsp; I;m stoked now!&nbsp; ! I&#039;ve got ideas and now that I have found others who know what I know....<br /><br />Ive got a fairly strong organic chemistry background, been cruising the precursor listings googling Phenyl-2-Propanones from Phenyl-2-Nitropropenesreduction of <br /><br />I am a newbie to the road but not really.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been placing orders here through others since winter 11/12&nbsp; During the interim while I find the time to dedicate to this venture .&nbsp; If I can be messaged please do.&nbsp; if there is a way to form a private group let me know...&nbsp; I am all in on this one.

Sure enough as evidenced by a post I made after my refill order.... my worry with CTM was that he would send out what ever he could get to fill the back orders. <br /><br />Spot on, smacked that nail square on the head.&nbsp; I got 3g of garbage still left from my refill.&nbsp; Did I slam his rating. no , mostly out of fear of blacklisting.&nbsp; I did however write in my review, the IV dose effects, which any experienced user should be able to interpret. Chaletia stuff is crap..&nbsp; I would like to try unlimited but looking at the pics... I got a franklin that says I can rail 1/2g and more , then eat a steak dinner and take a nap.

				Hey now if there&#039;s a group forming to rise against this wave of crap gear going around SR I&#039;d like to get in on the action! I found it almost impossible to sift thru the discussions/reviews to determine the quality of their gear, and then searching thru the forums helps but if it&#039;s not a recent discussion it might not be useful cause quality can vary greatly between batches. I pretty much gave up after local sources started selling this crap that was called meth and had some kinda upper in it, but came with excruciating headaches and the overall strung out feeling. Nothing euphoric about it, and that&#039;s what real meth is, period... seems like thats exactly whats going around here. <br /><br />Has anyone had any dealings with Xinhai? I have an order with him in transit and I am hoping it will be decent quality. I will post an update after i test it out.
