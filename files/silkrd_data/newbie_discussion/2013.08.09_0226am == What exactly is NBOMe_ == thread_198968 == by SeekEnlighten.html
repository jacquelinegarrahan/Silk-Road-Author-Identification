				I know its a research chemical and all....but does anyone actually know what the effects are by now? Does it have any physical effects on the brain or any harsh side effects? Also I read that you can overdose on it, unlike real LSD. Also any trip reports? Or things went wrong that one should be aware of before consuming?

				Wow that had alot of information thanks for the link! Would you guys consider this safe to use? I would probably only do 1 tab first time. Tabs dosed at 1000 micrograms.

				Oh man..NBOME&#039;s. Now, firstly, I&#039;d like to clarify that &quot;NBOME&quot; is a family of chemicals. My favorite is 25i-NBOME. There&#039;s also 25c, 25b, etc.<br /><br />Yes, they are safe to use, as long as you use them in moderation, like anything else. A 1000ug tab will give you quite a nice trip. Try smoking some herb after you begin to feel the initial effects to heighten the trip (visuals especially).<br /><br />Are you buying complexed blotters, or HCL? And I assume you&#039;re buying 25i-NBOME, am I right?

				Yea it&#039;s 25i. Haha its funny you say that, my friends are too sketched to try it until after I do haha...whatever.<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways, yea Nosajorolok it&#039;s 25i. Am i correct when I say 1000micrograms? I dont have the sign for that symbol that looks like 1000ug&lt;-----------that means micrograms right? Correct its HCL..to be honest though I dont know what that means could you please enlighten me? I definately will have some herb 8)

I definately will have some herb 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what a very trusted vendor told me when I asked him the same question, as I only have experience with complexed blotters. I just ordered 10 tabs of HCL.<br /><br />&quot;★★ HYDROCHLORIDE VS COMPLEXED ★★<br />25i that is in HCl form does NOT need to be complexed. Complexing is only required for freebase 25i, because freebase 25i would otherwise never work. Being that this is in HCl form, you can expect this 25i to last for months without it losing its potency. It&#039;s also very tolerant to heat. We tested out some tabs that were 6+ months old, and they still worked fine. It has a strong HCl taste- I know- but don&#039;t just swallow it. Let it absorb in your mouth for a bit. I&#039;ve added a slight fruit taste using natural ingredients to mask the taste. Unlike complexed freebase 25i, my blotter doesn&#039;t need to sit in your mouth for a long period of time to become active. Just 3 to 5 minutes with it under your tong is all you&#039;ll need. And you won&#039;t have to hold your saliva in your mouth either. You can swallow like normal.&quot;<br /><br />Now, I can&#039;t vouch for how accurate the part about your saliva is, because I have yet to try HCL blotters myself. But if that&#039;s true, you made a good choice in not getting the complexed. Holding your saliva in your mouth for 30mins-1hr is quite annoying.<br /><br />Tell your friends not to sketch, it&#039;s very safe. Just a few days ago I tripped 5x 800ug complexed blotters, and I am just fine. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend that high of a dose without prior 25i experience, and a solid knowledge that you can handle yourself tripping BALLS. <br /><br />And yes, &quot;ug&quot; is micrograms. I don&#039;t know how to do the symbol either, if someone could enlighten me there, that would be fantastic. xD

The two vendors I&#039;ve purchased from are dovecot2012, and Righteous. I can personally vouch for the quality of dovecot&#039;s 25i, (they are complexed), as that&#039;s what I took the other night. He sells them cheap, (I got x25 800ug tabs for about $20 after shipping), and one of those bitches will have you on a good trip. Unfortunately, they taste fucking HORRIBLE, and you have to keep your saliva in your mouth for the chemical to absorb correctly. Definitely a good 25i vendor, usually takes 6-8 working days to arrive to USA.<br /><br />As far as Righteous, I have yet to try his tabs. However, he has EXCELLENT vendor stats, and has been very helpful and responsive to all my questions. (Even stupid ones). His tabs run a little higher as far as price, but they are NOT complexed, and he is the one that adds the fruit flavor. <br /><br />Those are my 2 favorites, check em out! I know there&#039;s a few other vendors though, maybe you&#039;ll find a better deal!

				Yeaa Righteous is actually the vendor im lookin into purchasing from. Im getting the 10 tabs too lol. I dont believe ive ever tried 25i...I&#039;ve dropped a couple times but never really felt the effects. So would 1 tab be enough to get me on some good visuals/overall trip while still safe?

				Lucky bastard. I&#039;m dry until my DMT and 25i gets here. :/<br /><br />And as far as the trips....whew, that&#039;s a hard one to explain. As far as the actual hallucinations, it&#039;s VERY LSD-esque. Fractal patterns, kaleidoscope-like vision, music becomes insane, that kind of thing. It&#039;s UNLIKE LSD in the sense that it doesn&#039;t come with that psychedelic headspace that LSD gives you. 25i is a great party hallucinogen for this very reason, as it&#039;s much more of a clear-headed trip, you can act normal while tripping (at low doses, that is.) The first time I tripped (around 1200ug, 1 1/2 tabs), I had been smoking herbs beforehand and during, which might have effected how strong the visuals were. I remember sitting in a local park and watching a pine tree split into 4 different, individually moving parts, and then slide back and forth. My hose, some weeds, and any kind of pole/line always looked like it was slithering, kind of like a snake would, but converging into a single point, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />And oh yes, the 5 tabs...THAT was an experience. I started off taking 2 tabs, redosed another one about an hour later, and then 2 more sometime after that. (I was so fucked up by that point, I have no idea when I took the last 2.) Me and a few buddies of mine all tripped together. I remember tripping pretty hard on the way to the hookah bar we went to, but not hard enough where I wasn&#039;t making sense (well, mostly) and could still think straight. Then, one of my friends busted out some spice.......let me tell you, even coming from someone who doesn&#039;t like spice, the trip went from &quot;intense&quot; to &quot;a whole other level&quot; after hitting that spice. Edges were fringed with rainbow color, music wasn&#039;t heard, it was felt in the core of my body, and the urge to laugh was overpowering. I have no idea how much I must have laughed that night. After the spice I went to go pick up a dime bag with a couple homies, and after the first hit, I was incoherent. I was tripping so hard that I couldn&#039;t tell if the colors I saw were real or not. Wet tire tracks kaleidoscoped like crazy, making some of the most beautiful patterns I&#039;ve ever seen. The trails are worth mentioning as well, a car would drive by, and stay in my vision a good 3-4 seconds after it had actually passed.<br /><br />It&#039;s very difficult to describe the trip 25i gives you, and do it justice. It&#039;s one of those things you just gotta try for yourself, you know? I hope that when you do try it, you let me know how it went! I&#039;m very interested as to what you&#039;re in for ;)

				hahaha fuck that sounds amazing. Im so anxious to try it..I want a fuckin dope ass crazy experience. Probably gonna try it alone first time...just cuz I feel like ppl not frying as well would maybe lessen the intensity for me. This next week or so is going to be a loong wait. <br /><br />Ahh spice...I&#039;ve had some good times with spice. Some bad times too though. First time I ever tried spice was in my rehab I got sent to when I was younger...ironic haha. I personally would never combine spice with another substance that increases my heart rate because I&#039;ve had either a straight up heart attack, or anxiety attack on spice. It was scary shit like my fuckin legs cramped up my whole body like locked up...felt like a massive full body cramp. But yea Id be too pussy to mix anything but bud with the 25i.<br /><br />Btw im only high on weed hahah so its not even that great...I do appreciate every bit of ganja I smoke though..

				I&#039;m not sure how crazy it&#039;ll be with just a single tab, but you&#039;ll definitely trip, especially smoking weed. And ugh..the wait, the worst part.

I&#039;ve found the best way to combat this is not to keep in one position too long. Keep your body moving, blood flowing. I&#039;m a pretty small dude however, so this probably affected me more than it does larger people.<br /><br />And man, I&#039;m on UA&#039;s, I wish I could smoke a good bowl of buds :/ But hey, if I can&#039;t, might as well get some shit that they won&#039;t find out about ;)

				Righteous has a great product. <br /><br />21i-NBOMe is also my favorite of the family, subsequently, the one I have the most experience with. <br />I&#039;d certainly recommend it, but I&#039;d warn you about the nausea. It can be very common on the come up, but it is manageable. <br /><br />Have a great and fun trip.

				I definitely will, I&#039;m planning to write a full trip report. :D And best case scenario, it comes tomorrow/saturday, but if not, definitely by next Wednesday. I can be patient for the Spirit Molecule :)<br /><br />As far as your spice experience, that does sound like it could be VC, but I&#039;m not totally sure, it&#039;s kind of vague. In that case, I would definitely stay away from spice during your trip (as enhancing as it may be). <br /><br />Good ol&#039; Mary-Jane will do the job just as well, if not better ;)

				Well heres was pretty much happened. Happened like 2 years ago. Me and 2 friends went over our other friends&#039; house, and smoked some spice in the backyard. We all got insanely high and started freaking out about the helicopters in the sky. Wed flip them off and get paranoid and think they were comin back for us(was at night)<br /><br />Anyways then I went to my homies pad and slouched over on the couch coming down pretty harsh just laying there sinking into the couch and I feel like I probably forgot to breathe or someshit but I got a fat cramp like pain in my legs(both) and I thought it was a cramp at first but then my heart started beating really fuckin fast and I was out of breath..I could finish my sentences without gasping it was weird. Then the cramping went to my feet. By that time my friend brought over some water and it definately helped. Thats all that happened.

				Just remember that some select people have died from as little as 1mg, that is usually one tab.<br />People react very different to them, exceeding 4mg is a bad idea in general.<br />I&#039;d advise you to stay under 2mg, and try 500mg first time to see how your body reacts.<br /><br />Not trying to scare you away, with right precautions you should be just fine.

				I tried 25b first at 50ug (allergy test) and then at 400ug. <br />Felt trippy, color enhancement, and then about 3 hours in im smoking a cig, and my thumb<br />starts twitching out parkinson&#039;s style for about 30 seconds. It kept coming back every 5 min or so.<br /><br />The scary thing is that the thumb symptom persisted yet gradually lessened over 3 days.<br /><br />Maybe my physiology is not right, but I personally don&#039;t see myself using any nbome ever again.<br />Too bad I have read alot of good things...

				Try knowing the different kinds of nbomes. The popular ones are the 25C and 25i. I have only tried 25C. Being a fairly light person, 300ug tripped me balls out of this world. :D<br /><br />You will have a nice time with nbomes. Just remember that it wont last and everything will be alright in the end. :D
