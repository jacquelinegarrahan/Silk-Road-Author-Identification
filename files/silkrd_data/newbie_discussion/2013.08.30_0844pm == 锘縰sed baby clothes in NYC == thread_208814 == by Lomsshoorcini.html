				My baby was 6 lbs7oz and needed preemie clothes for a few weeks, then was in nb for about 6 weeks. I would get 1 preemie PJ just in case, and enough newborn to get through a week. That way if your baby is big,you wwon&#039;t have spent too much on clothes that they won&#039;t use, but ifthey are avg abercrombie and fitch outlet uk (http://www.abercrombieoutletes.co.uk/)<br />&nbsp;size, they will have clothes that fit :) if yyou&#039;re not having a shower, I wouldn&#039;t buy too much past size 3 months until you can see your baby&#039;s growth trend. Ex: my nephew is 6 mos younger than my dd, but they wear the same size. fyi, for future. a baby&#039;s growth tends to slow down at about 9 mos. Hope that helps!<br />I needed way more than 5-6 outfits per size. Babies can go through 3-4 outfits in a day easily. I found I got a lot of newborn, 0-3 month outfits http://www.borselouisvuittonoutletes.it/ (http://www.borselouisvuittonoutletes.it/)<br />&nbsp;as gifts but both of my boys outgrew this stage quick. They spent the longest amount of time in 6-9 month outfits. I buy most of my clothes for my babies at the goodwill. Since little babies do not go out and play in the mud you can find a lot abercrombie and fitch outlet (http://www.abercrombielondons.co.uk/)<br />&nbsp;of new or like new clothes second hand. I also found you can&#039;t have enough sleeper onsies. They can wear them at night or during the day, one piece http://www.poloralphlaurenoutletsuks.co.uk/ (http://www.poloralphlaurenoutletsuks.co.uk/)<br />&nbsp;only means one thing to wash and it is easier to change them into and out of then a multipiece outfit. I also like snap up shirts. The first time you have to decide to pull a poop covered shirt over the infants head (rather than just Abercrombiie and fitch outlet uk (http://www.abercrombiefitch1892.co.uk/)<br />&nbsp;unbuttoning off) you may be thinking the same thing. If you have any concerns about your own health or the health of your child, you should always consult with a physician or other healthcare abercrombie and fitch outlet uk (http://www.abercrombiefitchsoutletsale.co.uk/)<br />&nbsp;professional.
