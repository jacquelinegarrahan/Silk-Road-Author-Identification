				My opinion:<br /><br />Psychedelics are DEFINITELY not for everyone.<br /><br />Are you mentally stable? Any psychiatric conditions in your family? This can be bad for a would be LSD user.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough, do not fight the drug. Do not try to control it. No matter how deep you go, no matter how long you swear you were sitting there for, you are under the influence of a drug and it will eventually pass through your system and things will return to &quot;normal.&quot;<br /><br />I say &quot;normal&quot; because, depending on you as a person and how you think, you might not look at the world the same. I&#039;m not saying you will come out a completely different person, but it will definitely give you new perspectives and make you think about things different.<br /><br />Remember to keep an open mind, and avoid any situations that could turn bad... Trust me the smallest thing in the world can be scary on acid. <br /><br />For your first time I would recommend doing it somewhere you are most comfortable... If you don&#039;t live with your parents I suggest for a first trip there is nothing more relaxing than staying home. <br /><br />My favorite thing to do is.... <br />I set up all my music before I start tripping. I put music on inside, and on outside in my backyard(where I spend most of my day on LSD) <br />Make sure you make a playlist of all your favorite songs, if you would like some suggestions I would be glad to give you some.<br /><br />If you are really into electronic music and dubstep, and are tripping at night, I recommended glow sticks, and lots of them hahaha. <br /><br />Some people say looking in a mirror is scary, but personally I like it. <br /><br />I could write for days about LSD, but if you have any specific questions just ask.<br /><br /><br />What are your plans for when you trip?

				Don&#039;t just drop 3 hits at once and hope for the best.&nbsp; I&#039;d say try the half a hit every 45 minutes and see how you feel, if you do too much at once and start to get off you may not be able to control it.&nbsp; Easy does it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tripped all day up in the mountains just eating half hits and when I felt I had enough I stopped and enjoyed the rest of the ride.

Either pussy foot in, at a half a tab, or some sort of micro dose, orr do as all the L lovers say to do, and walk over to the deep end, and dive the fuck it. Just be sure to be mentally prepaired, ie no stress, worries and most importantly, NO obligations. Much love.

				PsychedelicSphere has some great advice. The added post that says Respect the Drug is very true. <br /><br />Take this Bruce Lee quote: <br /><br />“Empty your mind, <br />be formless, shapeless - like water. <br />Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, <br />you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, <br />you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. <br />Now water can flow or it can crash. <br />Be water, my friend.”<br /><br />Environment is key. Who you&#039;re with is key. Make sure they have good energy(vibes/karma). And have a blast expanding your consciousness!!!<br /><br />Favorite music is key. Shpongle is great if you like that sort of thing&nbsp; ;D

				Have a safe and comfortable environment, and preferably someone to &quot;spot&quot; you who isn&#039;t on the drug. Someone who you trust and can have a laugh with.<br /><br />Put tab under tongue for a few minutes then chew and swallow.<br /><br />Then have a good time!<br /><br />You must first be ready for the experience, your mind can really fuck you up but you&#039;ll be fine if you understand what&#039;s going on and prepare yourself for a mind journey. There isn&#039;t really much to say, you can just search the internet.
