				I have only encountered wonderful Officers who keep the peace and keep me safe.<br /><br />I have the highest respect for them, and they reciprocate. I highly recomend this approach.<br /><br />If you interactions with police are negative, you have only yourself to blame*.<br /><br />*May not apply for people who don&#039;t fit the archetype of who the Police actually believe they serve

				i have had a 5ft pig walk tall and fuck with me like he was the biggest badass on earth all because his cop buddies used him as the butt of their jokes. this 5ft fucker gave me a problem flag and all i did was stare in disbelief at his little dog persona. <br /><br />maybe not a dumb cop story. but a fucking asshole pig story.
