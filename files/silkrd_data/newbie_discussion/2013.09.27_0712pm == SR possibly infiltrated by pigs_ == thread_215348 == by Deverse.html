				So last night I was at a rave, I met some people who also used SR and they told me that SR was hacked by the Cops about 3 weeks ago, and they are slowly trying to catch all the vendors and buyers..... I want to know if this information is true of false, cause I been buying some pretty illegal shit and I dont want to go to jail yet....

				SR doesn&#039;t keep record of your personal information. Even if they hack SR there is nothing they can do. You are safe as long as you use encryption when sending sensitive information.

				Of course LE wants to catch all of us.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you do your homework and use PGP etc.<br /><br />Yet I don&#039;t know about it being hacked.&nbsp; I guessing they&#039;re talking about the freedomhosting thing?<br /><br />The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.<br />The second rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. <br /><br />If you keep talking about SR with everyone you know, what does it matter if SR is hacked, your local LE will just get you.

				If you&#039;re asking if there are LE here posing as buyers (and sometimes vendors), then the answer is they&#039;ve been here forever. There have been two Gawker articles (at least) about this site and several in Forbes as well (including an interview with DPR). With that much mainstream press coverage, of course there&#039;s LE here. To say they&#039;ve &quot;infiltrated&quot; the site is a bit of exaggeration though.<br /><br />There&#039;s no verification process, so anyone with an internet connection and torbrowser can create an account.<br /><br />That said, if you&#039;re buying personal quantities, LE is not interested in wasting resources on busting you. Remember this the FBI/DEA&#039;s jurisdiction, not your local/state police. They don&#039;t have the resources to apprehend and prosecute small-time buyers.<br /><br />Now if you&#039;re buying wholesale quantities to resell, then you might need to worry. Their primary target is the vendors though.

If you&#039;re talking about PGP, then you&#039;re making way too much out of it. I mastered it after my first order. The first order was hard, but I managed.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be intimidated; it seems impossibly difficult at first, but there are plenty of people willing to help noobs with PGP, myself included. Check out the PGP thread that&#039;s stickied at the top of the newbie section. You&#039;ll pick it up quickly, even if you&#039;re a non-tech person.

				Kinda funny how it&#039;s always the newbs with these &quot;the end is near&quot; posts. Even if somehow the feds did get all the addresses of the buyers (which as far as I know is impossible, particularly when you use PGP), do you really think they&#039;re going to span numerous state jurisdictions to bust every single one for small possession charges? As was already said, they&#039;re more interested in the vendors than the buyers. Only time you may need to be more paranoid is if you&#039;re buying bulk quantities to sell.

				Respect the game, and the game will respect you.<br /><br />The game doesn&#039;t like being spoke about out in the open, yet people still do that and they get pinched.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go talking about the silk road out loud at parties or with anyone, order what you want using the directions given to you by the Silkroad admins and you&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />
