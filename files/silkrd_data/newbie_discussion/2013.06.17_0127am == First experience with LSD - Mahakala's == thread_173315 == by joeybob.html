				Hey SR!&nbsp; I just wanted to write up a quick report on my first experience with LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been waiting to try this entheogen for years now.&nbsp; So, when I first got in the road a couple weeks ago I knew what my first purchase would need to be.&nbsp; I searched around, and decided to order a 10 strip from Mahakala.&nbsp; Let me first say that purchasing from him was a breeze, and I look forward to doing business with him again :D.&nbsp; Thanks Mahakala!<br /><br />As far as previous experiences go, I believe I have a lot of experience with different things.&nbsp; I regularly do my own mescaline and DMT extractions, and I&#039;ve tried various compounds such as LSA, 2C-E, 2C-P, 2C-I, 25i-nBOME, 25c-nBOME, 5-meo-dmt, DOC, MXE, psilocybin.&nbsp; I enjoy cannabis each night as it works as a great sleep aid, and I generally use entheogens once or twice a month.&nbsp; I really appreciate the mind space they produce, and they help with personal growth when used correctly.<br /><br />So this experience took place yesterday, a Saturday.&nbsp; I had planned it for the previous week and a half.&nbsp; <br /><br />The experience:<br /><br />I cut one of the tabs in half, and dosed at approximately 2:30pm.&nbsp; I was in good spirits, my mind was clear, and I was ready to travel down new roads in my mind.&nbsp; My cousin who is like a brother to me was heading down for a couple days over the weekend, and we had a hike planned, then mountain biking the following morning.<br /><br />The first hour in I didn&#039;t feel much.&nbsp; I spent this time surfing the web, reading up on different subjects(I love learning new things).&nbsp; First signs were a nice pickup, I felt awake and aware more than normal, and just waiting for the effects to fully roll in.<br /><br />My cousin shows up at my place about an hour later at 3:30pm.&nbsp; I load up some cannabis into my favorite water pipe.&nbsp; I let my cousin sample first, then I take a pretty decent rip.&nbsp; He&#039;s brought up his new mountain bike, and I decide to take it for a spin around the neighborhood.&nbsp; The sensation of riding and being free is great as always.<br /><br />We hop in my car right after this, and I drive us to our hiking spot a few minutes away.(Please note, I do not recommend driving under the influence, and I rarely do so)&nbsp; Between the cannabis and the ride on the bike getting my heart going, the effects really kicked in during the drive.&nbsp; I&#039;m beginning to sink in further, and my ego is beginning to dwindle.&nbsp; I feel as though I have become a fungus, or that fungus is taking over my brain XD<br /><br />We hike a short ways in and see it&#039;s completely swampy(we&#039;ve had a lot of rain recently), but decide to turn around and head out to a different hiking location 45 minutes away.&nbsp; I ask my cousin to drive this distance as I&#039;m definitely not up to the task at this point.&nbsp; As we are driving everything looks so incredibly beautiful, and surreal.&nbsp; I am a mix of emotions during this time, and can&#039;t decide if I am happy or sad.&nbsp; If I just relax and go with the flow everything is very upbeat.<br /><br />We arrive at the new hiking location, and the parking space is closed up for the night.&nbsp; So we decide to just drive around for a while making our way back towards my home.&nbsp; To my surprise he pulls into yet another 3rd hiking spot, 5 minutes away from home.&nbsp; We laugh about driving in a huge loop and winding up 5 minutes down the road anyway.<br /><br />It&#039;s about 5:30 at this point.&nbsp; I give him the other half of the tab, and we hike into the woods.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been on these trails a couple times, but it&#039;s a relatively small space, so I figure it would be hard to get lost.<br /><br />We notice it&#039;s just as swampy here, and the further we get in the worse it seems to get.&nbsp; But, overall I am happy, and excited to finally be out in nature.&nbsp; The intensity of the experience is leveling out a bit as most of the cannabis is working it&#039;s way out of my system.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel as though everything is going just as it was supposed to.&nbsp; I am so happy to be alive in nature, with my brother by my side.&nbsp; Everything is filled with so much meaning.&nbsp; At one point we stopped, and I pointed out two plants(same type) standing side by side separated by about 3 feet.&nbsp; One was in the sun light, and one was in the shade, and you could see the drastic effect this had on each one.&nbsp; The one in the sun was thriving, and the one in the shade was looking slightly worse for wear.&nbsp; The connection to me was that the difference of space is so small and the change so drastic, and this can be linked to our lives, we can take one step to the left or the right and it may make things great or worse depending on the environment we find ourselves in.<br /><br />The small streams are now rivers with all the rain we&#039;ve had.&nbsp; We stop a few spots in the woods, taking in all the sights and sounds.&nbsp; The different layers of sunlight reflecting of the trees, and sounds of birds chirping really compliment one another.&nbsp; We crossed many bridges in the woods(which also had a feeling of symbolism to life).&nbsp; We decided to stop on one, where the water was running particularly strong.&nbsp; We both feel utterly primal, with our egos washed away, sitting/laying/laughing upon the bride.&nbsp; Staring at the water, it looks as though it is running both down hill and up hill depending on where we focus our eyes.&nbsp; The flowing river begins talking to your mind if you listen long enough to loose yourself in the sound.<br /><br />After enjoying our time at the river for what seemed like eternity(perhaps 10 minutes or so), we get up and decide it&#039;s time to find our way back out.&nbsp; It feels like we are just getting deeper and deeper in the woods, and it&#039;s just getting swampier and swampier, and this is okay.&nbsp; I think to myself, how long have we been walking, are we going in circles?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never felt so lost in the woods, and been so completely okay with it.&nbsp; I know we will find our way back out, as we are keeping an eye on the suns location, and we still have plenty of time until the sun goes down completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />We find our way back out of the woods, and then decide to climb up a battle fort used during wars in times past.&nbsp; We walk up the stairs and we get to the top, to be greeted by the beautiful sight I&#039;ve seen all day.&nbsp; We live in such a beautiful location.&nbsp; We can see a town across a wide river, and the sun is going down.&nbsp; Everything is just so perfect, and I mention that a painter to try to paint the view, but it would do it no justice at all.<br /><br />After all of this we drive back home, and enjoy some home made meatball subs, and boy were they delicious :D.<br /><br />Well, this report is getting pretty lengthy, so I&#039;ll cut it a little short here.&nbsp; The rest of the night we enjoyed some fresh cannabis I&#039;d harvested a few weeks ago, and watched some entertainment.&nbsp; We had a lot of laughs, and felt like kids again.&nbsp; Getting to sleep was pretty difficult, but after about 4-5 hours of rest I woke up feeling refreshed and reborn into a new body/soul.&nbsp; Riding bikes through the woods this morning felt completely euphoric, and felt great on the body/mind.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with the experience.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I started with a half a tab to get my feet wet, as it were.&nbsp; It was just enough to get into the experience, and feel the awe inspiring nature of everything.&nbsp; The ego dissolving nature was different than anything I&#039;d experienced previously.&nbsp; I also noticed that a lot of the responsibility falls on the self.&nbsp; Most enthogens lead you by the hand, where as LSD quite a bit of where it will take you, falls on, well...you.&nbsp; There were times where I got a bad vibe, and the body load kicked in.&nbsp; It was easy to ease up and become light hearted again though, and the body load would go away.&nbsp; I&#039;m not normally very visual, and this was reminiscent of other entheogens, everything appeared in HD and would move, sway, warp, swirl, breath(it always feels like swimming underwater).&nbsp; The mental space was really swimmy as well, just flowing through different thoughts and ideas, with a very clear head space.&nbsp; Overall it felt very clean and good for the soul.&nbsp; It was very Zen, which I appreciated most of all.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to future experiences with this supply.&nbsp; It was a very changing experience overall, and I am so happy about the week to come.<br /><br />I just want to again say &quot;Thanks!&quot; to Mahakala for working with a newbie such as myself.&nbsp; This was one of my first purchases on the road, and went without issue.<br /><br />Take Care Everyone

				Nice report, sound like you have quite a range of experience.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Most entheogens lead you by the hand, where as LSD quite a bit of where it will take you, falls on, well...you. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Could you possibly expand at all on what you mean by other entheogens leading you by the hand in a way that doesn&#039;t happen on LSD? I have quite a bit of experience with LSD, phenethylamines and dissociatives, but haven&#039;t tried mushrooms, mescaline or dmt yet. <br /><br />Anything you feel like you could do to illustrate or explain what being &#039;led&#039; is like? I&#039;m pretty directionless at the moment, wonder if I could be having more beneficial experiences on entheogens that don&#039;t need me to do so much of the guiding...
