				It wont happen from me. <br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s common to get ripped off if you follow all the rules as you should. Sellers work hard to gain good feedback and probably don&#039;t want to stuff i&nbsp; t all up.

				Agreed. I&#039;m a new vendor but have been a buyer on here for some time. Just stay in escrow and avoid any listing/vendors that require you to finalize before you&#039;ve gotten your goodies, and you&#039;ll be a-okay. :)<br />

				Choose your vendor carefully, see if they have their own thread in e.g. Rumor Mill forum to backup the SR feedback comments. Search their username.<br /><br />Try and stay domestic if possible, at first, to eliminate the risk of e.g. border interception.<br /><br />AND NEVER, EVER FE. Just move on if requested.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor, but when I started out, I would send a short message before ordering to &quot;check they would be happy to take my order&quot;. Always got prompt, friendly responses which was very reassuring. And never ever any issues, apart from when I once stupidly, broke my own rules...

I wish you all the best with your first order Shm0keand@Panc@ke :)

				The more time you spend learning from others mistakes by reading through all the forums here - &amp; just educating yourself on what behaviors are customary on SR, what warning signs you should look out for, etc - the less likely it is that you&#039;ll get ripped off.

				I had a great experience with my first buy, PM&#039;d the guy to make sure it was all good with having no stats and they were really friendly and didn&#039;t make me feel like an idiot when I messed up PGP the first try.<br /><br />Just read the forums, check the vendor you want to buy from out on the forums, don&#039;t FE, do it domestically, use PGP, and you should have a good first experience.

I&#039;d say that makes you about as unsketchy as possible. Also expect they like the odd bit of positive feedback from noobs, as it might encourage others.<br /><br />The domestic vs international debate: obviously it depends on your order, I&#039;d be pretty relaxed about say, a few squares of blotter arriving from overseas. But an ounce of skunk, hmmm, might be a bit more likely to get intercepted...<br /><br />Good luck!

				I have made a number of purchases now.... there are vendors that will be happy to take your order if this is your first, on the other hand most vendors would like to see a few purchases from you...<br /><br />Place five orders to your drop address with items like a book, a cd, something that is very inexpensive.&nbsp; That was you will have a good buying record to show off....<br /><br />And never never FE.... ask me why?<br /><br />Hope your stay on the SR is a long and happy one!
