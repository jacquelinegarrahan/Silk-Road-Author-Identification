				So I made a mistake, twice, sending my info to a vendor. I had only my own PGP key selected and not theirs, so they were unable to decrypt it.<br /><br />Each time, they cancelled the order and issued a refund, minus a small amount. <br /><br />Not a big deal, but I&#039;d be pretty annoyed if I only had picked up enough bitcoin for a certain order then someone pinched an amount large enough to prevent me from completing it as planned.<br /><br />The total I wasn&#039;t refunded wasn&#039;t much, maybe $15 or so, but who keeps that coin?

				I think this is the commission that SR takes off of the order even if it&#039;s cancelled, if I&#039;m not mistaken.<br />Did you ask the vendor to hold one while you tried to figure it out? You could have always messaged them your encrypted address without having to cancel the order... Maybe the vendor thought your behaviour was sketchy?

				Yeah that&#039;s it exactly. Not a big deal, but if there are fees taken on a cancelled order, a simple message from a vendor first would be nice.&nbsp; :-\

				Probably it was the difference between what your bitcoin was worth when you placed the order and what it was worth when it was cancelled.

				Not sure why that would make any difference. It&#039;s jut coin in escrow. Not like someone had to repurchase something.

				Some bullshit happened to me man, but I bought just enough coin for this item! Now I&#039;m a $1.50 short of what I need!<br /><br />Worse still, the vendor canceled for apparently no reason! I did everything right!<br /><br />...can anyone spare $1.50... or anything to help me get there :(

				Well, <br /><br />Take this as a lesson learned about ordering properly and having extra BTC on hand.
