				Hi guys :D! I&#039;m Lidy (of coarse its shortened ;p) and me and my bf love SR a whole lot. We did however notice one of the most annoying things about bitcoins though is how they are attached to your IP when you purchase them from a computer with a bank, card, or any method except cash...I&#039;m pretty sure you fellas can agree :). So what me and my bf did was create a simple 9 step method to become 100% anonymous with your bitcoins!!!<br /><br />Wana see how? Just visit our site! <br /><br />This site is insanely simple but it gets the job done and well.<br /><br />What we do is take your bitcoins from a normal account, get a mass of several coins each hour and then transfer them through several different public computers in libraries, colleges, and electronic stores with hidden IP addresses, then we send you back your coins on a hidden wallet that you create! <br /><br />All we ask is a small 1% fee for transactions to help improve the site and to create a section of bitcoins that are 100% anonymous for our users to buy!<br /><br />This was just created yesterday so we know people will be a little worried about their bitcoins safety so we will do a trial period for the first 20 people who will only have to pay .001 bitcoins!

				AFIAK you can&#039;t offer products or services here without a vendor account.<br /><br />Assuming this were a legit service, it sounds like the buyer just gets back the same coins they sent after having been transferred through a few different wallets/services.

				not everyone wants to pay with cash. Ever think of that? We did. blockchain doesnt keep you safe from being tracked. Your IP address is right out in the open when you do that. If you created a hidden wallet and tried to get bitcoins your only option would be pay online with a prepaid card *not always safe* or pay with cash IF you can find a trusted seller and want to wait that long. How about think of the benifits like this allows you to purchase bitcoins ANYWAY you want and then allows you to filter them out of site, instead of coming up with stupid remarks that just show how much brain damage those drugs have been doing to you.

				Wow little hostile aren&#039;t we.<br />If you want to hide your IP address you could get a VPN.<br />I&#039;ve bought BTC using cash deposits on Local Bitcoins and it only took about 30 minutes, I also sell BTCs on SR and on average each trade takes less than 30 minutes.

Once they have your wallet address they can check the Blockchain to see where your Bitcoins have been going. It&#039;s hard, but not impossible for your Bitcoins to be traced. Bitcoins are pseudo-anonymous. That&#039;s why SR tumbles your coins.<br /><br />Another option for helping keep your Bitcoin use anonymous is Bitcoin Fog, which takes 1-3%. Can be found here: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ I haven&#039;t used it personally but I&#039;ve seen it posted here.

				So yeah what do you have to lose? There is a minimum requirement to send coins .2 so what would a person have to lose to give something a chance? I&#039;ll probably even drop the 1% fee every now and then to .2 .5 or .6 for holidays or other special events.

				Lol wut? This is so unnecessary.<br /><br />BTC Laundry = useless service for the over paranoid. As someone said before me, it&#039;s more likely to get noticed than say a direct XFER for MtGox as their BTC addresses are bound to be flagged in no time.<br /><br />Also GTFO with your webs.com nonsense please.
