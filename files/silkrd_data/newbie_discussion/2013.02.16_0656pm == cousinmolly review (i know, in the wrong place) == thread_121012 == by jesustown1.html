				i know im posting in the wrong place but i dont feel like spending hours posting spam to be able to post outside the newbie section. i recently had a very smooth and fast transaction with cousinmolly. i am reviewing the transaction because cousinmolly is a new vender and doesnt have many reviews. overall the transaction was 5/5, package arrived in about 3 days and was sufficiently stealthy (nothing too over the top but definately more than good enough to get the package to destination). overall great communication. will do business with this vender again and definately recommend him when you need your package FAST. will post experience when i have tested package

				Please feel free to cut/paste to your review thread, no time to spam 50 messages with all the timeouts.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a few orders on SR.&nbsp; Usually I go through another vendor but they&#039;ve been out for some time.&nbsp; By far my largest order to date, so I took a risk.&nbsp; CousinMolly has their shit together.&nbsp; Communication was top notch.&nbsp; Packaging/Stealth was also more than adequate.&nbsp; Speed was incredible- 2 days order-door, USPS.&nbsp; Smells stronger than anything I&#039;ve gotten in some time.&nbsp; The price couldn&#039;t be beat, almost seemed too good to be true for US mdma.&nbsp; Weight was slightly over, enough for a solid dose at LEAST.&nbsp; Many thanks CousinMolly, hope you have steady success here on the Road.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update here after use of the product with my SO.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little curious at the disclaimer to take a smaller dose than normal, so we&#039;ll see if it lives up to that warning....

				&nbsp;haha theres a disclaimer? if so hes definly not joking. took a point before a concert and a half point bump an hour later and holy shitttttttttt, that definately overdid it haha. this is definly great shit, i was talking to someone i met there and when he saw my eyes his exact words were,&quot;dam look at your eyes, looks like you could shoot fuckin laser beams out of those things!!&quot;. yea definly a licorice kinda smell, but idk to me it smells like a bottle of a and w rootbeer thats been left in the sun too long. Anyway if your looking for great fast domestic molly, cousinmollys the vender to go to. btw sorry it took so long to finish this, lifes been hectic.

			<dd class="postbody">
				So we dropped around 830p.&nbsp; I had capped up various amounts, a couple 100-125mg, and a couple larger ones at 170-190mg.&nbsp; I&#039;&#039;m a bigger individual, so it always takes me more, and been using for &gt;10 yrs.&nbsp; We did not preload or do anything prior to prep, just wanted to see what CM&#039;s product was like to an average user.&nbsp; My SO took 125, I took a 190, not heeding the &#039;warning&#039; CM had put in the original product post.&nbsp; By 9pm both my SO and my teeth were chattering and eye wiggling was starting already.&nbsp; So far, stuff was legit.&nbsp; The come up hit fast and hard.&nbsp; So hard, in fact, I puked at T60mins.&nbsp; Now, being pretty experienced, this rarely, if ever happens to me.&nbsp; I was a little concerned there might be something else mixed or cut with it along the smack lines, but I think the fact I hadn&#039;t eaten since noon might have effected it as well.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t hold the puke down, so had to let it go.&nbsp; I took another an hour later, and after 45 mins dry heaved for a couple minutes, which SUCKED while rolling that hard.&nbsp; So I think my sweet spot for this stuff was around 150mg.&nbsp; SO and I partied in our basement, she danced alot, we did the normal massages/light shows/head rubs and other activities.&nbsp; All felt great.&nbsp; I think we took a small booster of 100mg around midnight/1AM.&nbsp; More sexy time, by 4am I was passing out smoking a cig, slept till 1130 this morning.&nbsp; Very little hangover, I&#039;m sure tomorrow will be tougher.&nbsp; Took a couple hits of weed this morning and boom, roll kicked in again.<br />Verdict:&nbsp; Quality stuff.&nbsp; If this keeps on, CM and UGS will be my goto folks for quality mdma.&nbsp; Highly recommend.&nbsp; Communication, price, stealth, speed, and product were easily 5/5.
