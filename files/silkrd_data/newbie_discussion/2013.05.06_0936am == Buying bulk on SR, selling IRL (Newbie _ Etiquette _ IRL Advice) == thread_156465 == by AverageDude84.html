				Since I moved from a rural area into a largish city around 5 years ago I haven&#039;t made any social contacts. I&#039;m fairly reclusive / don&#039;t enjoy social contact too much, but I&#039;m also struggling for cash in these terrible times. I have a few friends back in my old rural location, and the obtain ability of substances down there is quite dire, especially for things like MDMA and LSD so there&#039;s definitely opportunity.<br /><br />Problem is, I have never really dealt with dealers and don&#039;t know any (my gear was usually obtained through friends who knew them). None of my friends are dealers and they wouldn&#039;t be interested in selling. I&#039;m not exactly &#039;street smart&#039; and I&#039;d have no idea how to talk to / approach one to even begin talking about getting something going.<br /><br />Is this a bad idea before I have even begun? I was planning on trying to get a contact through a friend, who they trust and that isn&#039;t a complete dick and seeing if anything can be made from it.<br /><br />I was wondering if anybody had any advice, etiquette, things to watch out for, things to say / not to say and just generally how to go about this? (or whether to avoid it at all costs).<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t sound like your current situation is ideal for a smooth transition into soliciting drugs within the black market.<br />Also, it&#039;s difficult to start such business endeavors without a solid foundation fund.<br /><br />Then again, I&#039;m sure successful schemes have been started with less opportunity.<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d listen to my gut.<br />If doing something like that would feel awkward or uncomfortable, maybe you should get a job pushing a mop.

				Well first let me start out by saying this is my first post so I&#039;m obviously a newbie here and I don&#039;t know anything about buying drugs off here, but after looking about some of the bulk prices it does look like there is some money to be made.<br />It really depends on what you want to sell though as far as how you would go about obtaining clientele. If you plan selling on MDMA you might want to check out some raves, clubs, or parties. People are pretty open about that shit. If you wanted to sell H, check out similar places, anywhere wheres there&#039;s a lot of people doing drugs, look for a junkie (you should be able to tell) befriend them and offer them free or discounted product in exchange for clientele. Junkies usually have other junkie friends. Don&#039;t admit to having anything on you though, say you have to go get it, or tell them you know someone who can get it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not comfortable with any of that then I&#039;m sure you could hit your friends up and offer them discounted drugs if they can help you build a customer base, that is, if the opportunity is worth going back to your old area for. I wouldn&#039;t be too open though, maybe use your friends as middlemen some and find a few good people and run with it once you&#039;ve started making decent money. Don&#039;t let anyone know you have bulk anything, and keep a gun.

				Thanks for the replies. Some good advice (minus the gun lol, I&#039;m in the EU and if I ever felt I needed so much as a knife I&#039;d give up the drugs instead).<br /><br />Still mulling it over, and I think it hinges more on who this friend of a friend may be or if my friend can act as a middleman as you advise.

				So far the most popular stories of people being caught for using the SR were bulk buyers and afk sellers.. Just putting it out there.<br />If you insist on dealing after all here&#039;s a few tips:<br />a) Don&#039;t be open about it.<br />b) Be aware whenever traveling with stock but also play cool.<br />c) Have the middleman refer to you as &quot;a friend&quot;.<br />d) Introduce yourself whenever needed with a fake name (make it sound real.build a story around it just in case you can&#039;t dodge questions)<br />e) Be straightforward. The more of an authority you present the more people (partners/customers) behave themselves. (it&#039;s not about being an asshole it&#039;s about being professional)<br />f) Don&#039;t sell to junkies.. That&#039;s just miserable.<br />g) Safety/Anonymity&gt;Ease of trading. Put high standards and keep them, whatever that might include.<br />h) If you feel unsure about a deal/transfer/w/e simply don&#039;t do it. Getting busted/killed/w/e is not worth the potential bucks (also known as opportunity cost).<br />i) Get to know how the local police force works.<br />j) Split money/stash/people&#039;s perceptions. &quot;The shade&quot; is your friend.<br />k) Take in account other dealers, their markets, their whereabouts.(competition becomes dangerous)<br />l) Apply all of the above but take in account your local factors which i may not know of to warn you about.(Warn yourself!)<br />I&#039;m sure there are people who know much more than me and that most of this advice is pretty much common logic and there certainly are more things to cover.<br />But i think that by considering these you&#039;ll have a solid beginning (don&#039;t rush it)

				i think it would be hard to start here and make a lot of money quick if you dont have a bit of cash behind you. It&#039;s $500 to start vending and because you will need to deal in escrow you&#039;ll be waiting for a few days to get the funds, so wont have money instantly to buy new stuff. You could start out slow and be fine but i dont think youd be able to make lots of money fast. Gotta spend money to make money unfortanetly :(

				Personally, I think it&#039;s a bad idea and the odds of getting f-ed greatly outweigh the potential gains.<br /><br />Selling to strangers is a lot riskier than selling to people you know. Even to people I know. Drug users IRL are generally a seedier bunch than those on SR. If they get busted they&#039;ll be more prone to snitch on you. If they get desperate they&#039;re likely to blackmail you or mug you. Plus you would have a hard time telling who&#039;s undercover and who&#039;s cool.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d find a honest job, buy for personal, recreational use, and build up a circle of trusted friends before you even consider ordering bulk.

				R L dealing is full of pitfalls, did it for a while and find sr far better idea. If your buddies are not<br />computer literate put to them you can source anything they may want and start buying on the road<br />and pass it on to those who you do know and not go on the street to find business.<br />In some places selling gear on the wrong corner can have you disappear&nbsp; for ever :-[<br />Do not ever let it be known you buy on the SR, told one bloke that i did and he is now a competitor&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Buy wholesale and sell retail, not much too it to be honest. Dealing on the streets is all about experience, so just get out there and get your feet wet. Only way your gonna learn how to do it. A few things to get in mind though.<br /><br />-Never show anyone your whole stash or tell anyone how much your really pushing<br />-Never keep all your cash/drugs together in 1 place<br />-Be careful who you trust, somebody will try to fuck you over at some point<br />-Be aware of who recently had run-ins with the cops, these are the people that are looking to roll on people to get their charges dropped<br />-Carry a knife, you don&#039;t need a gun your not pablo escobar, a gun just means another felony if you get caught<br />-You don&#039;t need to be a raging prick when dealing drugs but be assertive and firm. People will try to take advantage of you.<br />-If you have a significant other, don&#039;t leave them completely in the dark to what your doing but they don&#039;t need to know all the details if you catch my drift<br /><br />Thats all i got for now, good luck man.

				This a tough thing to give advice on. Depends on a lot of different factors. <br /><br />Whats been working for me is buying in bulk and having a a couple close friends go and work it for me, since i can toss em some for a good price and still make money, while they&#039;re out there on the street working it. <br />Helps reduce a little risk on my end, and everyone&#039;s happy.<br /><br />Of course it wouldn&#039;t really be a good idea for you to jump into that, I&#039;ve been working this stuff for a couple years now starting from the ground up, and its from all that experience going up the ladder while being cautious that I&#039;ve learned what I know now. <br /><br /><br />The only solid advice I feel like i can give you, <br />1. Save your money. Don&#039;t put all your eggs in one basket. In the words of Wu-Tang &quot;Diversify yo bonds nigguh&quot; I&#039;ve started from getting 2-5g at kept putting all my money into it until i could get 20g with all that i had and lost it all. Don&#039;t do that. Always make sure you have at least a small fund to get you back on your feet if things go wrong (this could also include an &quot;incaseofemergency lawyer fund&quot;)<br />2.BE FUCKING CAREFUL. This means keep shit off the phone. Fuck texts, and be careful when you call. Don&#039;t deal with shady fuckin&#039; kids who are naive and dont know what they&#039;re talking about. Even if they pay good money for a product, bad customers can bring down a whole operation, especially if they know a little more than they should. Try to keep your clients as cool as possible. All the people I sell to are people that would come over and hang out if I had a barbecue or something, they&#039;re people I can consider good friends. <br />3.Take a break. The only dealers IRL that I&#039;ve known to make bank and be able to spend the money outside of prison are those that stopped selling drugs. This is an illegal market with law enforcement agencies getting lots of funding to bring people like us down. They have more resources than most of us. Unless your smart as fuck and willing to go to great lengths to hide your illicit operation behind a legit one, take breaks, or set a goal to reach so you can eventually stop. I have a buddy that was selling lbs. of dispensary weed for a few months. He made thousands on a weekly basis, and once he had enough money to pay for a cheap house and fill it with new furniture, he stopped and got a new place. <br />4. Watch your greed. Everytime I&#039;ve made a mistake it was cus i was desperate for inventory and was willing to ignore my gutfeeling that said WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!?! <br />if something doesn&#039;t feel right, its usually because its not. Only buy/sell to people you are comfortable with and know that it will go smooth. <br /><br /><br />Some people are cut out for this line of work, others just aren&#039;t.<br /><br />It&#039;s a combination of wits and luck

				Lots of good stuff here. <br /><br />I would keep in mind the possibility of having to dump everything. Ideally, store the bulk of your product away from your house, only keep enough to cover any reasonable demands, like maybe an oz of weed or 20-50 tabs, but not so much that you cannot quickly dispose of it if the cops come. Without any drugs to point at, their ability to convict you will be greatly reduced. <br /><br />I would just sell to friends. If they want to introduce someone new, that person has got to become a friend first, and be very selective about who you trust to be a friend. This will help weeding out the shady customers although it will not protect against a customer turning snitch, that is pretty much gut luck and planning on a case by case basis.

				Sorry for the lack of activity, I didn&#039;t realise more posts had been made!<br /><br />Much love for some great advice. Currently taking it all in, mulling it over and doing some research. Deciding who I might be able to trust to initially approach and float the idea with, and working out how to take as much of the risk away as possible. <br /><br />Very thankful for some of these posts.
