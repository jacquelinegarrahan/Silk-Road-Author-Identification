				There are other threads on this I know, but they don&#039;t seem to answer what I am really looking to find an answer too.<br /><br />Has anyone here received shipments in Alaska. I know answering this gives an implication of your physical location, but I would like to find some feedback on the success rate in this part of the world. I am only considering domestic shipping, so if that helps at all with responses.

				I don&#039;t understand why you think shipping to Alaska is any different than the other 49 states? The USPS has the same guidelines for the entire country.

				I really don&#039;t. Simply want to confirm what I had understood. <br /><br />I am newbie obviously, and all of this seems very shaky. So I am going to far out of my way to research every angle I can. To understand pgp, btc&#039;s, the shipping process, even the security of my OS.<br /><br />I want to use this system. <br /><br />I have been doing these things on the &quot;street&quot; for quite some time, but prices don&#039;t match those on SR. Plus it removes a type of risk in replacement of another, and as far as I can tell at this time the risk of purchase through SR is less than going to someone&#039;s house and making a drive with a felony in the backseat.<br /><br />Correct me if I am wrong in my assumptions.<br /><br />Also, I am only interested in purchase of certain commodities that should be legal in the first place. And I am sorry for talking in such a passive way, again testing the waters and still nervous at this time.
