				I&#039;ve always had a hell of a time getting bitcoins (anonymously).&nbsp; If you&#039;re just getting small/user quantities go legit.&nbsp; Otherwise... I&#039;m not real sure... definitely been burned before getting bitcoins when there was the MASSIVE fluctuation a couple months ago.&nbsp; Just be careful out there.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s why you asked the question... well damn, way to be safe.

				localbitcoins.com<br /><br />Depending on where you are and how much you&#039;re looking for. <br /><br />localbitcoins offers online transactions, face to face / cash locations, an escrow system and a host of legitimate dealers.<br /><br />Since BitInstant went down I&#039;ve been researching them and they have various avenues to pursue when purchasing BTC. Of course there will probably be additional expenses, but it seems like online transactions trade closer to actual BTC value while local dealers charge a bit extra.<br /><br />Consider using the SR, IndianPillDaddy deals worldwide, charges 10%&nbsp; plus transaction cost using Western Union or MoneyGram. <br /><br />RxKing deals only with American MoneyGram cash transactions, minimum order $850 but no additional fees, even pays for transaction cost.<br /><br />Anyway hope this advice helps in some way. Any other questions or if I confused you PM me.

				see i thought about trying virfox or whatev its called but couple people said they are complicated and takes days to get the coins and localbitcoins havent really checked em out. i just would like to have someone tell me a site thats been used before and proven it is legit and that i could pay with a money order or pre paid debit card and not have to wait days for the bitcoins and get in a couple hours and make a order shortly after haha<br />

				localbitcoins is the best and fastest, but doesn&#039;t work in all areas, and can be a security risk in a small town.<br /><br />To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				You&#039;re going to want to use BitInstant (but they are currently down). If you go to their website, you can sign up for e-mail updates for then they get back, and they&#039;re actually offering some sort of &quot;We&#039;re Back&quot; deal for those who signed up, so that&#039;s just something to consider.<br /><br />The other thing would be Coinbase. You should set up an account and order from them (even if it&#039;s a small amount), because aftre 30 days, you can Verify your account and upgrade it to the point where you can get instant coins from them as well<br /><br />Those two sites are for future use though. Currently, you have to go localbitcoins or something along those lines :/<br /><br />-TrippingSquares-

				Just made first transaction with local seller of BTC through localbitcoins. We met face to face, BTC hit in less then half an hour, I gave him the cash and we split. When I set up the transaction, dude charged like three bucks over the price of what they were valued on SR at the time (101 USD + 3), so when I get them to my SR account they&#039;ll be worth 108 USD. Not trying to sound like a badass, but I got a pretty sweet deal.&nbsp; ;D localbitcoins charges .0005 BTC to transfer to another wallet. All in all in all, couldn&#039;t be happier. <br /><br />localbitcoins

				I&#039;m happy to hear it worked out.<br /><br />I think localcoin is going to get huge- as it&#039;s really the best way to trade and most difficult to regulate. <br /><br />cheers-

				I agree with the local bitcoin argument.<br />There is one guy so far in the city where I live.. he lives in a liberal neighborhood and does it from his porch. <br />(Which inspires a certain amount of confidence that he&#039;ll show you where he lives.)<br />I&#039;m going to use him for that reason and the regulation argument.<br />That and I&#039;d rather give someone local my business if i have the choice.
