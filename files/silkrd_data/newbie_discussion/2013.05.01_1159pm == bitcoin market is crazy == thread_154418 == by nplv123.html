				i saw ppl making a lot of money with coins in the last months... specially big vendor, they sell a lot, wait for the right to turn BTC to money, and then add a plus of 10% to their income... nothing bad.<br />most banks, and stocks dont pay that money...<br /><br />i saw a guy who made 1 million euros with 150.000 euros... this is serious, a lot of people are getting rich with that BTC thing, and speculation.

				If you&#039;re just an average buyer, the market price fluctuations shouldn&#039;t effect you much. Only buy bitcoins when you&#039;re gonna make a purchase and you won&#039;t really lose or gain any money.<br /><br />I thought it was interesting how bitcoins went from $135 a couple hours before SR got back up on the 30th, and then crashed down to $115 today. I&#039;m sure this is from vendors moving funds out of SR and probably cashing out some of it too. Just goes to show how much influence SR has over bitcoin price.

				It&#039;s all just so interesting to me how it took off and the value has risen so much from $5 dollar days to huge crashes that make the front page of the BBC, crazy.

				When bitcoin went from 50 cents to $32 n&#039; crashed the price went to $5-$10 or at least thats what the price was in around......september then to $12-16 around oct/nov where it stayed until the lastest bubble T think the question is. Is $120-130 the new $5-10 or $12-16

				in order for me to invest in a major amount of BTCs it would have to drop to the 50-80$ range and even then it would be questionable. might be worth a shot&nbsp; :-X

				I have learned to be almost zen about, happy when bitcoin goes up, but never dispointed when it goes down. After all eventually it will probably go back up. Of course when the price has a habit of doubling a bit too fast, I would stop buying coins, cause you know a bubble is up and coming.
