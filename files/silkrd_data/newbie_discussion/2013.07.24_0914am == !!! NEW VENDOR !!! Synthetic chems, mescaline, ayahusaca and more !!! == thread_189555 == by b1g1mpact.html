				Hi All,<br /><br />3 Months on the road now, and chugging along nicely! My product list is always growing - I have a host of unusual products, some unique to the road, from 3 types of Mescaline containing cactus, &quot;San Pedro&quot; Peruvian Torch, &quot;San Pedro&quot; Trichocerus Pachanoi and Trichocerus Bridgesii (Pachanoi and Bridgesii up tomorrow!), Ayahuasca, Iboga (Powder, bark and capsules), Salvia Extracts, Synthetic Chems, the best Synthetic Cannabis on the Road - going well with dealers, producers and punters alike, Mapacho (Amazonian Indian super snuff / tobacco), Virola Bark (Contains Bufotenine, DMT and 5-MEO-DMT) for smoking, 4 different strains of Kratom. Dang, too much to list here. Check out my store page (Link at the bottom of this post) t see the full list.<br /><br />I have the best stealth on the road, its so good I got message by a customer who though I&#039;d sent the wrong item, until I explained he had the item, and the packaging, sealing and invoice were in fact, stealth. Dumbass. My customer service is as good as it gets, and we always make sure you get your items safely and quickly. 100% positive feedback in nearly 200 transactions - I&#039;ll be top 1% vendor before you know it :-)<br /><br />COMING SOON: My own personally extracted pure DMT - not cheap, but the cleanest organically extracted crystals on the road bar none!<br />COMING SOON: SHROOMERAMA - Classic and rare varieties, 5 cubes&nbsp; and 2 super strength (Wavy cap and Azurescens) - will also be available in bulk for other vendors / dealers. Bags just a few weeks away...<br />COMING SOON: Tampanensis (Philosophers Stones) &amp; Galindoi truffles.<br />COMING SOON: Ultra Changa, my own unique version of changa - with added Virola bark, to add extra bufotenine, DMT and 5-MEO-DMT to the Yage, DMT, Blue Lilly, Passion Flower and Damiana!<br /><br />Hope to see you soon - any questions, just ask!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />B1g1mpact

				WOW....That&#039;s quite a selection of products, my friend! That Peruvian Torch sounds VERY interesting....Never tried cactus before, but have been wanting to for MANY years....Just unable to find it where I live.....You seem to be off to a good start with your business here on the road....I hope to be placing an order next week when I obtain some coins....Cheers!&nbsp;
