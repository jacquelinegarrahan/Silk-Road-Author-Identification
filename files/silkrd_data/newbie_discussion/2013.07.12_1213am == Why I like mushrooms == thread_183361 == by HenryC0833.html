				&quot;We willed the goddess into being,&quot; the man said.&nbsp; I was almost out of my mind on mushrooms and it was hard to focus. And it was noisy. Bar in a little ski town.&nbsp; Longest day of summer, dark now.&nbsp; Lots of almost-sex going on in there. Gorgeous people. The man had a bushy beard and a tie die shirt.&nbsp; A hippie, and judging from the grey in his beard, probably not a neo-hippie.&nbsp; A real one.<br /><br />&quot;It was our desire for her to manifest herself that brought her into being,&quot; he said.<br /><br />I turned and looked at his wife.&nbsp; Long stringy blonde hair, fringy suede jacket, kind eyes, drinking a beer.&nbsp; &quot;He always does this.&nbsp; Ignore him if you like.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So...&quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;We created her?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No.&nbsp; We allowed her to manifest.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So....&quot;&nbsp; I looked in the mirror. Even in this town, there is evidence of authentic life.&nbsp; Moms take their little boys in the summer to play soccer in the park late into the twilight, and I remember what that was like, when I was a kid.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So... she needed us?&quot;<br /><br />He smiled.<br /><br />I looked around, gathering my thoughts.&nbsp; I was a little overwhelmed.&nbsp; &quot;OK, let me get this straight...&quot;&nbsp; But he was gone.&nbsp; Just that quick; wife and all.&nbsp; I walked outside.&nbsp; No hippie.&nbsp; <br /><br />It had been a long day.&nbsp; A long grind though the prairie.&nbsp; The wind was strong, and it blew heat from under the fairing onto my legs, and I needed&nbsp; a gallon of Gatorade at one dusty Kwikee-mart.&nbsp; There was the thrill of running up the backside of the Sangre de Cristo range, and the road past the lakes that reflected the mountains and the sky, the freezing overcast pass, and the highly technical part down into town.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was cool now, and if you walked two blocks, away from the bars and the gorgeous rich people laughing in the light, you could see the stars, and the Milky Way.&nbsp; A meteor shot across the sky, leaving a trail like a sparkler.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen nights where geometric patterns shimmered across the heavens.&nbsp; <br /><br />The sky.&nbsp; Hippies.&nbsp; The Goddess.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I like mushrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />And that, my chirren, is 50, I believe.&nbsp;

				Mushrooms are a great trip. I probably enjoy them more than any 2C-X drug or LSD. Growing them is even more of an adventure and I highly suggest checking it out. If you do the research, the initial startup is very cheap and can be a fun hobby

				They most definitely are my babies. You gotta treat them like they&#039;re your child to have them grow to their full potential. Hydrating at least 4x a day, clearing out the CO2 at least twice a day, etc...<br /><br />It&#039;s really something else though to watch them grow from tiny pins into massive 28g stalks (wet of course)

				They are an amazing trip with a blast of euphoria. When you are on them, you will wish you were on them the rest of your life. I came to the conclusion whilst booming that I should just live in a cave and grow my own food and shrooms for the rest of my life, seemed like an awesome idea at the time. Of course when I sobered up I realized how silly this was, but I will never say no to a shroom trip. Make sure to smoke some weed too, it can really enhance the trip and can kick it back up once it starts wearing off.

There are alot of guides to get you started. All you need is vemiculite, brown rice flour, and a spore syringe (can legally be bought online for 17 dollars) and a few other materials to construct a terrarium. It&#039;s a lot of fun, I was very skeptical at first but it worked out well. I recommend starting with the B+ strain since they are known as the most forgiving.

It&#039;s really like landing on Pandora.&nbsp; Move through the world with wonder in your heart.&nbsp; I love this part.<br />3.&nbsp; The lesson.&nbsp; There is always a lesson, and it&#039;s not always easy.&nbsp; You might feel emotions of shame, sorrow, regret.&nbsp; This is a part of the thing and you have to learn to cherish it, regardless.&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; The mushroom is a thing.&nbsp; It may sound crazy, but once you&#039;ve been there a couple of times, it will seem quite natural to look at the mushroom as a very old, very wise, and in the end very kind entity.&nbsp; To be clear, we have a symbiotic relationship.&nbsp; You learn this when you grow mushrooms, and realize over the years that psychedelic mushrooms couldn&#039;t live absent human habitation and agriculture.&nbsp; So to be fair, you give the mushroom life on this planet, he gives you wisdom.&nbsp; Just realize that&#039;s what this is, it&#039;s not all ha-ha look at the crazy lights.<br />4.&nbsp; Resolution.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is always the sense of peace at the end.&nbsp; The sense of at-one-ment.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Shrooms aren&#039;t easy.&nbsp; But they are deep.&nbsp; Which do you want?

				I doubt it affects brain tissue.&nbsp; Ethnobotanists think this stuff has been in use for thousands of years; one theory holds that shroom use is the basis for all religion.<br /><br />It&#039;s the mind you need to think about.&nbsp; If you have&nbsp; a pre-existing mental illness, think twice.&nbsp; If you&#039;re young and don&#039;t have a strong ego, think three times.&nbsp;

				Okay I have to admit that I&#039;ve never tried Shrooms because a friend of mine went on a really crazy trip and it didn&#039;t turn out well but you guys are really making me curious.<br />Unfortunately I have no idea about shrooms so would you be so kind and give me hints as to what to look for and maybe even vendor recommendations?<br />I keep an eye on this thread, you guys seem cool.

				I had a beautiful trip 2 nights ago on about 3-4g of mushrooms, picked them with a friend earlier in the week in a pack just 10 minutes from home. It was 6 hours of pure bliss with the most intense visuals and clear head i have ever had. I am definitely going to be having another trip in the near future

				Question for you all, Ive taken shrooms only a handful of times in my life. Almost everytime I had a negative experience(probably due to the fact that there were people I didnt know, setting wasnt the best, and I had some freak outs. Nothing major, just a mind fuck that I wanted to go away, but I had to just ride it out. Are there types of shrooms that dont mess with your head as much, I love the visuals, the sounds, body high, the wavey trails, the grins, etc. But I tend to get in a loop with my thoughts, this is probably due to the reasons I stated in the beginning. But I really want to try them again and have a great experience after reading some of what you guys have said

				The mushroom isn&#039;t trying to make you miserable.&nbsp; You are absolutely correct that you need to be in the right setting.&nbsp; For Pete&#039;s sake, stay away from negativity.<br /><br />With regard to the internal environment, you don&#039;t have to love yourself, but you need to at least like yourself.&nbsp; If, in spite of your faults, you really believe deep down that you&#039;re an OK guy, a lot of the &quot;mind fuck&quot; stuff becomes a really positive learning thing.&nbsp; The mushroom is like a really good teacher who pushes you to achieve more; he can be critical at times but the reality is, he cares about teaching and has your best interests at heart.&nbsp; <br /><br />Meditate next time, before you drop.&nbsp; Breathe in: I am awake, alive, full of energy.&nbsp; Breathe out:&nbsp; I am calm, focused, confident.&nbsp; Breathe in, breathe out.&nbsp; Buckle in.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you start freaking out mid-trip, there&#039;s a simple fix:&nbsp; Sing!&nbsp; Out loud.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be shy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Singing scares that bad juju away instantly.&nbsp;

Galindoi powder. Ive used this stuff multiple times and it is an extremely forgiving strain. Great for first times or people who have had some bad experiences with shrooms in the past. They are crazy euphoric and great when used in a nature settings. My experience included Trees dancing everywhere, crazy patterns all over the ground, everything in my field of vision looked like an oil painting but the best part was watching a creek flow. It was an absolutely beautiful experience. The comedown is extremely gentle as well. I have never been more relaxed in my life. Give them a try you wont regret it.

				all of my funky fungi trips have been beautiful experiences.<br /><br />one shroomy sunday last spring i received a mystery call on my phone; suprise acapella rehearsal! after bidding my funky friends adieu i left to join the most jovial group of dudes, with whom i had of course been singing with the last three years. singing was an absolute blast; i could hear every note in my head crisply, i felt the rhythm with my whole being. then i was informed we were learning a new song; &quot;yellow&quot; by coldplay.<br /><br />we started singing, picking it up handily, as we all had heard the song many a times. it was just too pretty. up to this point nobody had any clue i was funkin, but this was the most lush, gorgeous arrangement i could imagine, and as we were singing tears just started rollin down my face. when we stop i wiped my face and i&#039;m sniffling; i knew i was gonna get goofed on, so i just look down and start chuckling, the dude next to me leans over, gives me a hug, and everyone just starts laughing, so then i&#039;m laughing more because now everyone knows clearly i&#039;m high as shit, one dude even calling me out on it!<br /><br />best rehearsal of the year, pure bliss in not enough words :)

				Using the five &quot;W&#039;s&quot;<br /><br />Who:&nbsp; &nbsp;Your first time, bring someone who is calm and experienced.&nbsp; Be around people who are curious, thoughtful, and love to laugh.<br />What:&nbsp; Your very first time out, I would start with a quarter of an eighth.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s like two capsules if you use them that way.&nbsp; Be very cautious with mushroom tea, it can hit you really fast.&nbsp; <br />When:&nbsp; Don&#039;t take shrooms on an impulse.&nbsp; Make sure you have plenty of time set aside (it&#039;s like a six hour experience) and give yourself time to prepare mentally.&nbsp; Make sure you have plenty of time to relax, visualize, and fill your heart with love.<br />Where:&nbsp; Shrooms tend not to like busy environments.&nbsp; It is possible to go to a party or club on shrooms, provided you&#039;ve taken a low dose.&nbsp; If you take just enough to where you are just starting to see visuals out of the corner of your eye, you can be around people.&nbsp; If you&#039;re taking an &quot;effective dose,&quot;&nbsp; you&#039;re a lot better off in a calmer environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally I think shrooms love the sky and do well outdoors in nature.&nbsp; <br />Why:&nbsp; you are here to learn.&nbsp; You are taking a journey to what will probably seem like an alternate reality.&nbsp; This is the real thing, and if you&#039;re not ready for the real thing, think twice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll tell you a little story using Christian symbology.&nbsp; What if you knew for a fact that Jesus Christ himself regularly attended your church, and there was&nbsp; a possibility he might plop down on the pew right next to you?&nbsp; How would that make you feel about going to church?&nbsp; If your answer is, &quot;That would make me nervous, I&#039;m much more comfortable going to church with symbolic representations of the divine rather than the holy Dude himself,&quot;&nbsp; then please do NOT take mushrooms.&nbsp; <br /><br />Look, nothing can beget something not of it&#039;s own nature.&nbsp; An apple tree can&#039;t bear peaches.&nbsp; (Holy dude said that.)&nbsp; That spark of intelligence you perceive between your ears, that didn&#039;t come from nowhere.&nbsp; You live in an intelligent universe.&nbsp; You are well insulated from this universal intelligence, being all wrapped up in a bag of skin and bones.&nbsp; The purpose of the mushroom, no more and no less, is to remove that insulation, to get you right there in it.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s why the mushroom likes nature so much, why it likes the sky, especially the summer sunset over the longest day of the year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because you&#039;re in it!&nbsp; Because you get the insight that, for your entire life, you&#039;ve been watching MOVIES of the sunset, and this is the first time in your life you&#039;ve ever been IN the sunset.<br /><br />You sit down in church, and the guy next to you nudges you, and points across the room, and says, &quot;See that?&nbsp; That&#039;s Jesus Christ himself.&nbsp; How bout that!&quot;&nbsp; And like when you see a celeb in your club, you feel like you&#039;re a part of something.&nbsp; And then one day, you show up at church, and the big man just plops down next to you.&nbsp; Turns and smiles.&nbsp; &quot;What&#039;s up, little brother?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you&#039;re not so ashamed, or embarrassed, or insecure, or afraid that you can&#039;t chat the dude up.&nbsp; That you run out of the room and realize, later, staring at the ceiling in your bedroom, you probably could have asked him anything.&nbsp; Anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />That, little brother, is why people love shrooms, or hate them.&nbsp;

				Most of my mushroom experiences have been very difficult, VERY deep. But i always came out on the other side feeling that i had learned something. There is a reason people say they are like teachers. My last trip was with my long time girlfriend, we ended up taking a shower at the end of the night while she was pretty much back to sober. I sat on the floor of the shower laughing at the water and she just stood above me and washed my hair. But earlier that night i was having a hard time. Be prepared for freak outs, but know that something comes from them!
