				Hey all, <br /><br />New vendor here looking to start moving small amounts of Subutex, and some DMT and Shrooms at competitive prices. <br /><br />I have tried to do my research but understand there are some real pros on here who have been successful for a good period of time, my specific questions are : <br /><br />Postage - I am quite confident of keeping a sterile environment for packing goods, I am slightly concerned about postal stamps (area specific) and if these could be used to track you down (I know it would be possible) how do you avoid this?&nbsp; Am I correct in assuming that if properly addressed in the right format the package would go through a machine sorter as opposed to manual sorting?&nbsp; &nbsp; And am I correct in thinking that when its sorted by a machine it doesn&#039;t&nbsp; get stamped with ink, it now gets a couple of curved slits cut in the front of the stamp? <br /><br />Also secondly transferring bitcoin into cash - if I ran it through a network of wallets in random amounts (the wallets set up through tor) could I sell them legitimately through a UK bitcoin trade website and get them paid into an account, or maybe buy silver and gold with bitcoin? <br /><br />Any advise on these topics, and any other pro tips no matter how seemingly insignificant I would be very grateful for the advise - I don&#039;t want to get this wrong for obvious reasons&nbsp; , <br /><br />Thanks in advance- Regards <br /><br />BitzNBobz

				Its cool man, I am sure someone will - The best vendors are probably too bloody busy to check the forums! <br /><br />I think using a bitcoin washing service is the best bet - I did find an unofficial silkroad FAQ which had some good advice - but my questions still stand if anyone can help, <br /><br />Thanks.

				Use generic stamps and printed address labels, mail is only sorted manually if there is some error in the sorting process, express mail also often gets a second look by postal workers because its very important they make it to their destination on time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure about cashing out bitcoins, I know you can purchase cash with them here on SR or perhaps you could sell them on localbitcoins?<br /><br /><br />Protips: Do you synth your own DMT and grow your own shrooms? These are very cheap drugs to produce, you could sell them much cheaper than the competition and make some nice profit<br /><br />. A good way to attract customers is with *100% free* samples in exchange for *honest* reviews. This is the quickest way to build a good rapport with the community, just make sure you&#039;re not picking a reviewer that has 1 post and 0 orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;Never ask a user to FE until you&#039;ve established some trust with the community, or you&#039;re shipping to high loss countries. Again, it just makes people feel more comfortable dealing with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;Be polite, active in the forums, informative, &amp; accessible and soon you&#039;ll be a top vendor. :)
