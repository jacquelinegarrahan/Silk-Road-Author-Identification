				I would like people to know, I know of one Police Officer, who uses the site for his purchases, think about it, he can&#039;t score on the street. This is his salvation. so just a reminder, not all L/E on here have negative things in mind, or have a hidden agenda.

				Probation Officers are even worse than cops because they couldn&#039;t make it as cops. And yes, they are obviously dumber than cops.<br />I have respect for some laws, I am a biker after all.<br />I don&#039;t care for most cops but not all of them are bad eggs, they still have to do their job but if you befriend them, they will look the other way for you.<br />Edit: Should have said: &quot;They might look the other way for you&quot;.

				Personally don&#039;t like Cops as a rule but I know a couple indirectly.<br />Like any occupation you get good, bad and ugly.<br /><br />When a Cop resuscitates your old grandmother or nabs a bag snatcher or helps you out a vehicle after an accident maybe you&#039;d think a little different.<br /><br />The &#039;War on Drugs&#039; is driven by Politics not Police.

A client of mine for 12-13 years, had only met him in person 2x (i managed some rental properties for him that i&#039;d taken over from another realtor that had passed away suddenly). Most contact&nbsp; with him was over the phone. Well, i was real professional in how i handled his accts, and he was a super reasonable, nice, easy to please client, obviously intelligent but with no unreasonable expectations -&nbsp; whenever i went over and above the &quot;call of duty&quot; on his accts he&#039;d notice and thank me (unlike some clients). <br /><br />Anyway, one day we&#039;d met at one of his properties, and we were talking - i&#039;d just had an encounter with a fucking arrogant asshole traffic cop and i mentioned it to him (in slightly more professional/polite terms) - he responded &quot;I was a cop for 7 years but was forced to leave the force&quot;. He went onto say that he and his partner had pulled a 18 yr old kid over and the kid had given his partner some lip - his partner started body slamming the kid on the trunk of his car - Ron (the client) finally had seen enough and told his partner to stop. When &quot;backup&quot; cops roll up, his partner turned to one of them as they walked up, saying &quot;HE&#039;S ONE OF THEM&quot; (referring to my client), as in the &quot;them or us&quot; mentality. Ron said he couldn&#039;t live that reputation down, he got harassed every day, cops would bump into him in the hallway intentionally, that kind of shit - he changed shifts to the graveyard shift hoping to lose it, and it followed him there (the harassment from other officers). This was in a well-to-do, yuppie county PD, not 8 mile road detroit type precinct. he said that was when he quit the force, went to law school and at the time of our meeting, was law clerking at our state&#039;s supreme court.<br /><br />Few good guys last very long in PD, and the ones that do, while they may not act arrogant or like assholes when dealing with the public, will not contradict their &quot;brothers in blue&quot; because of the ostracization that will follow. Couple on top of that, local PD get shit on by federal LE, and hate it whether they show it or not. Then when they&#039;ve got someone around them they perceive as &quot;beneath&quot; them, in authority, ie the public, they pass the shit they got on down - that&#039;s their release mechanism.<br /><br />so like others have said, fuck the cops

				I think the thing I don&#039;t like about most cops is that they will always act like your friend when they&#039;ve got you. They&#039;ll pretend like they don&#039;t like doing this either, but if you help them along then everyone will be alright. That&#039;s just bullshit, they want you to help incriminate yourself so it&#039;ll make their job easier. That&#039;s just not cool. <br /><br />But anyway, I do agree that not necessarily all cops are assholes. However, even if they are an alright person in private life, they have chosen to become part of a corrupt system. They may just be another gear in a machine and have no control over what that machine does, but the machine wouldn&#039;t function without gears so they still responsible.

				I don&#039;t particularly like Parking Wardens&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve had my run ins with Cops and 90% of the time they were assholes but it&#039;s a technique used to un-nerve and/or aggravate but I play the game don&#039;t have an attitude and get on my way.<br /><br />A guy I worked with was a Cop for over 3 years he got out and did manual work - he hinted that the insular mentality wore him down.

				Where I live personally, there is a task force officer literally 2 houses to the left of me.&nbsp; However, he works for the county just below me and keeps all of his work there.&nbsp; Only piece of work he comes home with everyday is his police car or his Undercover SUV.&nbsp; Keep in mind, I smoke a lot of bud, I like to trip and roll.&nbsp; He knows me and I am sure he knows my lifestyle but he doesnt bother with me.&nbsp; He even says that &quot;Hey brother, how ya doin&quot; in the hippie style way of speaking like hes tryna be cool with me or something.&nbsp; Hes a big dude, very muscular, all tatted up and he is also an MMA fighter.&nbsp; I would never fuck with him but he seems to leave me alone.&nbsp; Another cool thing about this service, its right under his nose too...HAHAHA<br /><br />My parents are very good friends with him also.&nbsp; They both know I smoke weed and assume I get my hands wet with other things too but I doubt that they would ever discuss that with him.&nbsp; I am also always sure to stash all of my shit up whenever he comes over to talk with my father.&nbsp; He cuts his grass every weekend so my father has in a sense made friends with a task force officer and my father is also an ex marine and my mother is a hippie.&nbsp; How opposites attract like that I have no clue.<br /><br />Dad is a dickhead, mom went to Woodstock and got to watch Hendrix destroy a guitar on stage, still has that woodstock ticket to this day and its laminated.<br /><br />Makes you wonder how many actual real life LE&#039;s out there actually use this service in other states to get anything considering that they are police but still like to relax and cant bc of the outside world and people being skeptical

				I got a story. Went to school with a guy, who ended up becoming the county sherrif here. I probably voted for him when I still voted. Anyway the motorcycle season was starting and I was in the garage, having a few demon brews (steel reserve), I was playing some metal and gettin&#039; fucked. I got a white hair in my anus and started it. Wasn&#039;t long until I was loaded, and hauling ass out of the city limits. I got yanked by him.<br /><br />Parked in mud because I didn&#039;t want to appear drunk but knew my breath was from hell. (Get it?)<br />Anyway I asked him:<br />&quot;Hey (name), I need a favor. I need you to let me go this time&quot;. He knew I was drunk, he caught me doing 95 in a school zone, he could smell the beer, I had no insurance (didnt tell him that).<br />He let me go.<br />Much later he got busted stealing money from the county. No lie.<br />&nbsp;::) :-X<br /><br />V.

				Whoaa there, hold your horses, who said he was a friend? I said I know of one police officer. He is a corrupt cop who was cultivated through a friend of a friend. Basically this guy gets rid of problems. You had a pull from the police l and got a ticket, no seat belt on. £50 and its disappeared, you got caught speeding hey, no problems he will charge you £100 pound a point off your licence. Don&#039;t be naive guys all cops have a point where they will cross, and all top dealers have police paid off.&nbsp; That&#039;s the problem with you lot, you don&#039;t read properly, I said I know of one officer, not that I know the officer.

				This guy then gets the magistrates court to inform the DVLA that you were not responsible for the said offence i.e This person wasn&#039;t driving when the car went through the speed camera at 100 miles an hour. The DVLA then send your licence back minus the offending points. It also works other ways, he tips off dealers when they are getting raided, and in turn receives a fat brown envolope, this stuff has gone on for years, and now with our government fucking people left right and centre, including the Police, then they are going to make any cash on the side they can

				The other day a couple of my idiot friends decided to roll a blunt and light up in a crowded area. A police officer came over to us dressed in civilian clothes, so my one friend said to him, &quot;hey, do you want to buy some weed?&quot; the officer said, &quot;don&#039;t worry I&#039;m not going to arrest you, but why do you sell drugs, I mean, I&#039;m a cop and I just don&#039;t get it.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I then said, &quot;well, ill see you guys later, and I was ghost with the quickness.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Haven&#039;t heard from those friends since. <br /><br />As you guys said, the nazi troopers where all doing their jobs. Fucking pigs<br /><br />I will say, one of the best moments of my life was when I was arrested as a kid for doing some disorderly things. <br />One police officer said to the other, &quot;You forgot to check his backpack.&quot; They then proceed to take out a bag of about a half ounce of some premium weed. The one cop says to the other, well look officer _____, this guy has a bag of grass trimmings in his bag. We&#039;ll take this ;) . The officers then told me that they decided I could go free and to have a great day. The officers high fived and left with the weed.<br /><br />Sorry if this story came out wrong, I&#039;m pretty fucked up at this moment.
