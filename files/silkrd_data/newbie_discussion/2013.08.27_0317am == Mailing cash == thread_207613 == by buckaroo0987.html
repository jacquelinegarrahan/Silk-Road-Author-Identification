				At some point I may want to sell my BTC for cash. <br /><br />I see there is one or two vendors on SR that look pretty reputable, by my question is...<br /><br />Does mailing cash require the same kind of stealth as mailing drugs and the like?

				You might want to ask your buyer about it, at the very least to make sure it is secure from being stolen. I should think any reputable cash in the mail dealer would provide heavy stealth by default. Drug dogs are trained to smell cash as well, and large amounts of it are VERY smelly. IDK if you are in the US, sending less than $10,000 is legal without reporting to the feds, but large amounts would probably attract a whole lot of unpleasant attention, maybe even be reported to the IRS. I know that many countries have very strict regulations about this stuff so I guess everyone needs to do their own due diligence. It is true that domestic parcels (in the US and most other western countries) are rarely searched, but I personally would want the peace of mind.
