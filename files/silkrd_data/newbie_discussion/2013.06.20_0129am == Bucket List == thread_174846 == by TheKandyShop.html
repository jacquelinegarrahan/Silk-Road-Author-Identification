				But since I&#039;ve already been skydiving...&nbsp; &nbsp;guess that doesn&#039;t really count regarding the OP&#039;s question.&nbsp; I think I&#039;d just have to say I&#039;d love to go to Australia.&nbsp; Maybe Equador too..&nbsp; &nbsp;have read some things about Equador that makes me think that it may be a bit closer to a &#039;free society&#039; than most places in the physical world.... though I doubt it&#039;s really anywhere near truly free....

				Two things on the list to share....<br /><br />Non-Druggie: Travel east across Europe into Aisa by train as far as is possible (wars permitting), I live in the UK so its quite a long way, I think you can get to Iran (might be a bit scary at the mo with all the stuff in Syria etc!)<br /><br />Druggie: (as this is the SR forum!) I have not tried LSD and MDMA combined yet, when I was younger did the LSD now I do MDMA more but this summer hope to do the candyflip as I have supplies from SR to play with ;-)

Personally I&#039;d go to ecuador and just stay in banos for like 2 weeks. They have ziplining, canyoneering, rafting, rock climbing on volcanic rock, a volcano, bunch of waterfalls and rivers, horse back riding... just awesome. But it&#039;s certainly not a free society. The current president is a hardcore socialist and trying to take over a lot of industries. It&#039;s almost straight out of an ayn rand novel how the gov&#039;t is acting right now. But I guess at least he&#039;s built a bunch of roads, new airports, and other infrastructure and hasn&#039;t just robbed the central bank and left the country like other presidents have. South america is kinda fucked, not africa fucked, but still fucked.
