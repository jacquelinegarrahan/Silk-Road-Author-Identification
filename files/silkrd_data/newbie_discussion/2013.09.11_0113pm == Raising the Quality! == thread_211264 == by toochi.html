				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see better drug quality sold on the SK. Supposedly, the problem should be already solved by the SK with its rating and forum system, but we all know this isn&#039;t true. So, I wonder why? <br /><br />Of course it&#039;s all about asymmetry of information. This is the best theory I&#039;ve found that I think explains what&#039;s going on in this kind of market:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons<br /><br />So... why don&#039;t we all have near perfect information about a seller&#039;s merchandise? Why are all the scores so skewed toward 5.0?<br /><br />I&#039;ve found myself buying some crap to some 5.0/4.9 sellers and in the end not feeling compelled enough to leave a bad (or even neutral) review. <br /><br />I think that the SK system lacks some mechanism to MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO LEAVE ACCURATE REVIEWS.<br /><br />So, a simple idea is that a BITCOIN TIP SYSTEM for reviewers could be the solution. It seems to work in other forums. And I&#039;d be willing to pay bitcoins to reviewers that I&#039;ve found leave honest reviews and I can trust. I may even feel compelled to write a short one line review the next time I find a product not so good.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure some of you have thought before about this problem and I&#039;d love to hear other ideas.<br /><br />

				Personally I ignore the reviews and feedback and go to the Rumor Mill, the information there is vastly more accurate and useful. Each vendor has a review thread, and most of the drugs have their own threads (eg, LSD Avengers thread and Deemsters thread (DMT)).

				I don&#039;t think people care about helping others is the main problem. They have a bad experience and just move on letting everyone else get the same shitty deal.

				Yeah, I think it&#039;s stupid that people give 5/5 just because it got there. If the product isnt up to snuff, DONT GIVE 5/5.

				Again, major fundamental problem.&nbsp; MANY vendors now say &quot;leave a 5/5 or you are blacklisted, no exceptions&quot;&nbsp; I have to say the feedback system can be manipulated, flaunting Vendor rules with no recourse to SR,&nbsp; You may receive but can&#039;t sample without at a little time.&nbsp; But Vendors want there $ and /5 NOW.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or your done with them.&nbsp; After hours of vetting etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s just whacked.
