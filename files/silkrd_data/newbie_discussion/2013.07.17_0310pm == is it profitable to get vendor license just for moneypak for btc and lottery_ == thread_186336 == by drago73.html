				I&#039;ve seen too many people get fucked over for their moneypaks, so i would have to slowly build up a reputation as a trusted vendor in that. Whenever i&#039;m left with .10 btc&#039;s or less i like to play the lottery game with optiman&#039;s lottery(haven&#039;t tried any of the others. I&#039;ve been extremely lucky in that i have won 3 times with him, so i&#039;ve won more btc than i have put in, but not by much. Like i said, i&#039;ve been lucky. You basically buy a &quot;ticket&quot; for .02 btc&#039;s and if your transaction number ends in 3 you win .20 btc&#039;s it&#039;s only taken a couple of hours each time i&#039;ve won to get the btc in my account. Helluva game and very creative way to earn money on optiman&#039;s part. Don&#039;t know yet if i would charge 5 or 10 percent on the moneypack exchange though.just wondering how profitable this could potentially be. As far as selling drugs, no fucking way! I&#039;m a user not a seller! I would so get high on my own supply, so not even going to attempt it. Lol

				I&#039;m sure you could do well if you&#039;re reputable and reliable. Obviously you would need some start up capital. You can&#039;t sell coins unless you buy them etc. The vendors that seem to last the longest are the ones that plan ahead and don&#039;t sell more coin than they have.

				Plus from what I understand moneypak and the likes are making it more of a royal pain in the ass to cash them out. If you do too my transactions in a period of time they flag your account, etc. So probably would need multiple identities or people involved to do any kind of volume.

				If you buy them on bitstamp you can charge 0% fee and still make like 8 dollars per coins. Sell 100btc in a day ($10,000) thats 800.&nbsp; There are more customers than you can handle trust me.

I have been fortunate that i haven&#039;t had a vendor do that to me, but it happens all the time. There has to be a creative alternative way of building(showing) trust to buyer that they won&#039;t get ripped off. We all know that a free listing especially can be easily padded to make vendor look legit. I&#039;m holding onto another 100 dollar moneypak for dear life, because i don&#039;t trust anyone as a buyer. I&#039;m asking about the experience for me as a possible vendor in the future, but i&#039;m trying to look at it through the same lenses that a buyer would use when faced with the decision to buy or not. How come the unwritten set in stone rule has to apply only to vendor getting money first and buyer coming second. What if it was reversed? What&#039;s your opinion on that? Would i just be out of business on the first day if i were to go that route because people would take advantage.

				What is to stop the buyer from taking advantage?Their completly anonymous. Yea you got your buyer stats but id take $1000 if i just had to start a new account its really not a big deal. I dont know about you im not willing to take that kind of hit. I think the rep of a seller is alot better protection then the rep of a buyer. They buyer gets their coins anyway. Unless you cant trust youself with not scamming people i cant see any reason at all to do it that way.

Yeah, i was buzzing and comtemplating a little hard earlier. Lol definitely see the vendor first, buyer second being the only option. Am moving in a couple of weeks, and just wanted a little supplemental money on the side. You seem thoughtful and educated. What do you think of the lottery games they have here if you don&#039;t mind my asking?

				Ive been a buyer on the road for like a year now but i have never really given them much of a look. What you were explaining seemed pretty interesting i didnt know thats how they operated. Or is it just that particular vendor? Anyway seems like it would make a little bit of money but i cant imagine itd be a huge moneymaker. If you a good amount of startup money then selling btc is a good safe bet.

I saw you on another thread and immediately judged you as a troll/scammer&#039;phisher. I should not have done that, and i apologize as well. You seem like a good, honest vendor. I will give you a shot on my next moneypak(usually do localbitcoins.com). Very personal and helpful. Thanks again!
