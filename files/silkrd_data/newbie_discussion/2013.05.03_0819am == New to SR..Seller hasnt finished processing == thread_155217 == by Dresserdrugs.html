				I placed my first order approximately a week ago through a reputable seller for a small order of 20 vicodin. The seller hasnt answered my message or even read it for that matter. I checked his page earlier today and other people have left positive messages about the service and their order date was after mine.<br /><br />My question is, what should I do?<br /><br />Dresserdrugs

				I placed an order a few days ago,same thing,a vendor with good feedback,and my order is still processing when he clearly states 24-48hrs delivery at the most.I&#039;m hoping its because of backlog too.SR says you can cancel after 4 days if no sign but I hovered over the cancel button and it says 6 days to cancel.wait and hope I suppose.

				I am sure a lot of vendors are behind because of the site issues.<br /><br />Also, make sure you read the vendor&#039;s profile page (not just the product page) as some have very specific shipping schedules (such as they only ship on certain days of the week).<br /><br />l would also recommend sending vendors a message prior to ordering while you are building your stats just to confirm that the vendor sells to new buyers and any limits they may have. I have no proof but I think it helps in establishing a bit of credibility with the vendor....

				Cancel the order and find another vendor. He clearly does not value your business and isn&#039;t concerned about small orders. Hopefully your BTC hasn&#039;t dropped significantly since that time (if it&#039;s unhedged)

				Probably the vendor is just struggling to get onto the site. I personally have only been able to get on for one day this whole week. It has been a nightmare...<br /><br />Most people are contacting me here or through my tormail. If your know your vendor&#039;s forum name try to PM him here
