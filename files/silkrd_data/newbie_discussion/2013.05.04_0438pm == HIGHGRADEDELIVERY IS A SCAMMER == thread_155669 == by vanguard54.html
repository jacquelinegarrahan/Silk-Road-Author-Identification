				Ended up ordering 2lbs from HIGHGRADEDELIVERY,&nbsp; he sent it express, thursday, received today....<br /><br />inside was:<br />a used gatorade bottle filled with water <br />crumpled up newspaper (all from his shipping location)<br />the 4 bags of vacuum seal that were cut off and made to seem like they were opened, however no residue was inside them.<br />except for one in which he left one gram <br /><br />worst scam attempt ever but i guess he did it because of the silk road outages<br />took mad pictures at least<br /><br />just spreading the word, for later, these obvs probably nothing that can be done until the road is up.. poor time to order i guess<br /><br />vanguard

				Vanguard 54 received the 2 Ps that he ordered, and turned around and tried to fuck me out of my Bitcoins.&nbsp; He was partly successful at it.&nbsp; This is one reason I never sell to buyers who have bad buyer stats including the amount of Bitcoins spent, and most importantly the Auto-Finalize rate.&nbsp;
