				I&#039;ve been using silkroad since March without any major issues until now. It really all started about 2 months ago I ordered 10 grams of speed and 5 grams of MDMA from budworx but this order left me short on bitcoin for some LSD I needed for a music festival. I asked budworx to cancel to the speed and told him I&#039;d order 5 grams straight away after, but he cancelled the MDMA and only sent out 5 grams of speed even tho I&#039;d paid for 10grams. so I lost 10% on the MDMA being cancelled and 5 grams of speed. This was probably just an honest mistake and he was trying to do me a favor. I wrote to him and said it was short 5 grams and will he just put 5grams into the next order and I&#039;ll just go ahead and finalize. I didn&#039;t want the hassle of resolution center or my stats getting messed up over what works out at about Â£35 difference.<br /><br />So I got more bitcoin and on the 2nd of July ordered an oz of his cheap weed I wrote a note under the address saying &quot;don&#039;t forget about the 5 grams of speed&quot; and sent him a mail. Round this time bitcoin value really crashed and I got a message from budworx saying my order was on it&#039;s way and would I FE he said I didn&#039;t have to but he would appreciate it. I thought why not help him out so I did........ Yes I&#039;m very stupid and over trusting. Well the package still hasn&#039;t arrived, It could be that Royal Mail are really slow and it&#039;ll turn up shortly but a flatmate had one of her legit packages opened and sellotaped closed and I&#039;ve another package in escrow that&#039;s taken 2 weeks I really think the postmen figured out my packages were from the silkroad and stole them so on Monday when they hadn&#039;t arrived I really lost hope of the packages coming.<br /><br />I sent Budworx a mail didnt go into too much detail but just copied and pasted transaction info date ect. and said &quot;My weed still hasnt arrived I FE&#039;d cause you asked. I really cant take a loss this big is there anything you can do to help me out?&quot; he sent me back this &quot;Sorry we cannot bring this to resolution.&quot;<br /><br />Does this seem fair?
