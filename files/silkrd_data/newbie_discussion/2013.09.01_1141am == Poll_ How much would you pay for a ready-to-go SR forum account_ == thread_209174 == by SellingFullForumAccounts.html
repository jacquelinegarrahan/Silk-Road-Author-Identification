				I couldn&#039;t understand why you would want 0.25 (assuming BTC??) for an SR Forum account. No one stands to gain anything from just buying a forum account like that, especially one that costs roughly 35$, or 70$ if you want a custom one. Maybe if you started at 10$, people would look at it more

				Thanks PK<br /><br />That&#039;s why I made this poll, but so far it looks like nobody&#039;s interested in $10 and somebody is funnily enough interested in about $30.<br /><br />But the value would be that a vendor could jump into the forum immediately, without having to spend valuable time scraping around the newbie room.

				I am selling forum accounts for vendors looking to get into the main rooms faster. Here are the details:<br /><br />1. You may select a username from the list available at the time of inquiry<br /><br />2. Buying access to the username will cost you 0.3<br /><br />3. 50+ threshold achieved via non-intrusive spam (numbers 1-50 posted in a single thread usually)<br /><br />4. You save time getting into the action, or have an extra &#039;support&#039; account available to help build your main account&#039;s credibility<br /><br />5. No refunds
