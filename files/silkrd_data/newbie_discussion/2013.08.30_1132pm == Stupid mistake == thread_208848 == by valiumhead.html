				Hi, <br /><br />I&#039;m fairly new to SR (about 3 months) &amp; have just made a stupid mistake, &amp; I&#039;m looking for any advice. I&#039;ve been really brainless &amp; would appreciate any advice<br /><br />I made an order, it arrived quickly, great stealth, really good product but half of what it should of been. I contact the vendor, he&#039;s really helpful &amp; polite &amp; offers to send the rest plus a bit more. We are messaging each other &amp; he asks for me to crypt my address.<br />Then I make the stupid mistake; I message back &amp; say &#039;sorry I haven&#039;t managed to master encryption yet &amp; have asked a friend to help me, til then here&#039;s my address&#039; &amp; send it to him unencrypted. He messages back: &#039;I can&#039;t work with you.&#039;&nbsp; I sent an apology &amp; asked what I should do about the remaining bitcoins if he doesn&#039;t want to continue with the rest of the order due to my stupidity (it hasn&#039;t been finalised). There&#039;s been no answer. After much reading on these forums &amp; general research, I have realised that he&#039;s probably not gonna read or reply to my messages. Is there any way I can get my remaining bitcoins back or have I blown it? It works out at about 35 BTC. <br />The vendor was professional, very communicative &amp; polite &amp; helpful, &amp; it was v good quality. I feel like a right twat &amp; am having a crash course in encryption before I order anything else. <br /><br />I&#039;ve taken security measures which were sloppy before &amp; improved them since realising what I&#039;ve done, &amp; read the forums a lot.<br /><br />Anyway, I was wondering if there is a &#039;resolve&#039; option or something &amp; if so, whether I should go down that route, or if I should just accept the loss of BTC as karma for being a stupid twat (tho I&#039;m still struggling with encryption despite a few video tutorials &amp; lots of reading; hence asking the friend for help, so I must be really stupid!:0)<br /><br />Cheers in advance for any advice,<br />From an embarrassed, stupid newbie<br /><br />PS: to add to my cock-up, a few weeks ago I fell for a phishing scam where the captcha had only 3 numbers &amp; no letters. I was tired &amp; didn&#039;t realise what it meant so just logged in. Then I tried to log in a week later, &amp; couldn&#039;t log in for 3 weeks, so contacted SR support (after reading on the forum what to do, these forums are the best). Support were really helpful &amp; I got my account back, with 0.71 BTC missing from it! Then I make this stupid mistake with an unencrypted address. . <br />

So he already had my address unencrypted from the start, like the other 4 orders did. <br />From the vendors reaction to my address when we were messaging each other, I just assumed that SR is so good it automatically encrypts all delivery addresses. Coz otherwise why would his reaction be so extreme about me sending it unencrypted again?? <br />Btw thanks AnastasiaWest for the encryption help, when I&#039;m not so tired I will read it &amp; hopefully finally crack it!

				I would take it to resolution when you can and tell them basically exactly what you just told us. Support will be able to back up what you are saying by the pm&#039;s sent between you and the vendor showing he agreed to send you your missing partial order. <br /><br />I have no idea what will happen, but that&#039;s what I would do. My two cents.

				LATEST UPDATE:<br /><br />I eventually heard from the vendor about 3 days after his &#039;I can&#039;t work with you&#039; message.<br />He offered to give me back 0.36 BTC &amp; was very polite. I told him I&#039;ve been getting help with encryption in the SR forum (I still haven&#039;t had the chance to look at AnastasiaWest&#039;s encryption lesson yet) &amp; he said when I&#039;ve learnt it, we could do business again. So it worked out fine in the end &amp; all&nbsp; I have to do now is learn encrytion.

				This all sounds very strange, and your &#039;stupid mistake&#039; isn&#039;t a stupid mistake at all as far as the vendor is concerned. Why would the vendor care if you send your address to him unencrypted? Encrypting addresses is for the buyer&#039;s security and makes no difference at all to the vendor&#039;s safety.<br /><br />At least you got your coins back - assuming you made a decimal point error in one of your posts anyway! I would be pretty pissed off if I was owed 35btc, but got 0.36btc back!<br /><br />But yeah, learn how to use PGP. It really isn&#039;t hard and it is totally worth it because then you know for sure that your address is completely protected from the moment it leaves your PC to the moment the seller unencrypts it at the other end.
