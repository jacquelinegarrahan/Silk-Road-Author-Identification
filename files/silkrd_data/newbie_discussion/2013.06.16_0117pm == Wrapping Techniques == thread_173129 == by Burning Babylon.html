				Title: <strong>Wrapping Techniques</strong><br />

				The purpose of this thread is to discuss various ways of wrapping products, in most cases the first layer on the product before any stealth or Moisture Barrier Bags are applied (although some vendors use that as the wrapping itself) but it can also be for various containers. I suspect very few vendors use any Wrapping Techniques beyond a ziploc bag and those who do will most likely not post, so this will most likely be more of an intelligence thread for the future if we can afford some of the more advanced equipment.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Now there&#039;s various types of products that can be wrapped and I would make a distinction between the following forms:<br /><br />* Solid: Shapes like for example hash bits or ecstasy pills who have fixed dimensions.<br />* Powder: A powder like for example pure MDMA or DMT.<br />* Fragile: Shape that can easily be crushed or malformed like for example mushrooms or cannabis buds.<br />* Liquid: For example alcoholic beverages or dissolved GHB.<br /><br />Other than that I&#039;m going to format my listings somewhat similarly to my old thread Heat Sealing Equipment; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160856.msg1139175 :<br /><br />* Name: What kind of name the product goes under, pretty straightforward.<br />* Shipping: To what countries the product ships to.<br />* Link: Where to acquire the product(s).<br />* Price: The current price of the product.<br />* Type: What kind of types the product can wrap according to the categorization I mentioned previously.<br />* Size: How much space the type of wrapping takes up dimension-wise.<br />* Closure: The mechanism used for closing the wrapping.<br />* Extra: Any additional information and comments, possibly a review of the product itself if the user posting about it has used it for a while.

				* Name: Minigrip Bags<br />* Shipping: Worldwide<br />* Link: http://www.minigrip.com/brands.html<br />* Price: Varies<br />* Type: Solid, Powder, Fragile<br />* Size: Varies<br />* Closure: Re-sealable<br />* Extra: The most famous Ziploc Bags, Minigrip has some of the best quality ones around and is most likely the most widely used Wrapping Technique in use by vendors today for the majority of drugs. Will provide decent protection but will take an uneccesary amount of space for most solid types of drugs compared to other wrappings and won&#039;t offer much protection for fragile type drugs.<br /><br />* Name: Glass Vials<br />* Shipping: USA &amp; Canada (to send worldwide, see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143747)<br />* Link: http://www.specialtybottle.com/glassvialsmi.aspx<br />* Price: Varies<br />* Type: Solid, Powder, Fragile, Liquid<br />* Size: Varies<br />* Closure: Vial Cap<br />* Extra: Provides excellent protection and can store all types in it, although not very storage efficient for most solid shapes. Fairly expensive compared to other methods.<br /><br />* Name: Food Grade Wax Backed Foil<br />* Shipping: Australia, Bahamas, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Germany, Guam, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, Virgin Islands<br />* Link: http://www.candywrapperstore.com/Wholesale_1000_Sheets_Food_Grade_Foil_s/684.htm<br />* Price: $75.00 each package of 1000<br />* Type: Solid<br />* Size: 6 x 7.5 inches / 15.24 cm x 19.05 cm<br />* Closure: Manual<br />* Extra: A foil which is somewhat similar to the one used by http://www.cheebachews.com/edibles.html Can pretty much only be used for solid types but with labels with graphics on top of the foil it can potentially look very professional.<br /><br />* Name: National Shrinkwrap Complete 18&quot; Shrinkwrap System<br />* Shipping: US (to send worldwide, see http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143747)<br />* Link: http://www.nationalshrinkwrap.com/catalog/item/4626141/5119006.htm<br />* Price: $349.95<br />* Type: Solid<br />* Size: Varies<br />* Closure: Heat Sealed Plastic Bags<br />* Extra: A fairly inexpensive way of shrinkwrapping various containers like for example DVD cases.<br /><br />* Name: Polypack Robotic Pick &amp; Place System - ROKH<br />* Shipping: US (probably needs special customs clearance)<br />* Link: http://polypack.com/equipment/robotics<br />* Price: Most likely very expensive :P<br />* Type: Solid<br />* Size: Massive Size Equipment Wise<br />* Closure: Heat Sealed Plastic Bags<br />* Extra: The most advanced type of wrapping machine I was able to find, although it only supports solid types this would ideally wrap containers which can hold anything.
