				Hey guys I was reading up on these forums and noticed that it is beneficial to know how to use someone elses wi fi for purchases and general browsing. I was wondering if anyone could link me to any of the already posted answers/topics on this and give me some research and reading material so that I can learn how to do this. Thanks!

Not trying to hijack, just add a few more related questions.<br /><br />I often use wifi of neighbors whose networks I&#039;ve gained access to and wonder if this is a safer way of getting here via tor than my own wifi or if I&#039;m making things worse.<br />a few facts:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; I only use networks with WPA2 that I&#039;ve cracked<br /><br />2.&nbsp; of those I only use networks whose routers have zero authentication and stay that way for a while before I create a pwd protected admin acc(as I assume the owners are not too tech savvy and our major ISP&#039;s &quot;techs&quot; have to install them this way but they don&#039;t tell the customer that they should be changed, in most cases). D-Link actually instructs you to set it up this way<br /><br />3.&nbsp; and I only use the said networks to connect to tor and ONLY AFTER TUNING OFF ALL LOGGING AND CREATING A PASSWORD PROTECTED ADMIN ACCOUNT on the router, then waiting and watching for signs they are smarter than they appear. <br /><br />4.&nbsp; *I don&#039;t do anything malicious to these networks, creating a router admin password could be seen that way but some other hacker w/malicous intent would have eventually, and if I believe after observation that thay are not going to create one I look at my actions as hardening their network :-/ ??&nbsp; I of course can&#039;t help the fact that the WPA2 password was able to be cracked using pretty common wordlists.<br /><br />I hope these questions fit into this thread.<br /><br />Am I an idiot putting myself at more risk or is using different wifi to connect to SR better than using my own wifi.<br />

				If you ask me the people recommending to use someone else&#039;s wifi just don&#039;t know much about tor. There is no need for this unless tor lets you down, or you do something inadvisable like use a non-tor proxy. Though if you buy your bitcoins through a service that forbids tor (a bad idea in its own right) then not using your own wifi is better.<br /><br />All that said, aircrack-ng is good free software for wifi cracking. It&#039;s a little complicated, but fun to learn about if you&#039;re into that sort of thing, and certainly useful. Though as I say, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessary for silk road usage; tor will keep you safe.

				upthera, to answer your questions, using someone else&#039;s wifi certainly doesn&#039;t do any harm. But so long as you&#039;re using Tor, it doesn&#039;t matter either way. I&#039;ll go into a bit more depth.<br /><br />If it&#039;s an unauthenticated wifi link, then anyone can sniff what&#039;s going over the air. However Tor has solid encryption, so you&#039;re safe from that. You&#039;re also safe if you just use HTTPS (though of course not anonymous), but bear in mind that anything not using encryption like regular HTTP is very easily sniffed, and people can session hijack, steal passwords etc. But Tor is fine anyway.<br /><br />Going back to the point, the only reason using someone else&#039;s wifi is useful is so that activity can&#039;t be traced back to your IP. But Tor stops that already, which is why it doesn&#039;t matter for Silk Road.<br /><br />Hopefully that answers your questions. If not let me know and I can elaborate :)

I guess it was always more of just hiding as much of my tor usage as possible from my isp.&nbsp; Small town full of sheep(the human kind), How many people use tor. Not many, I&#039;ve looked around and if you live in a place like me you are in a fairly small group, 5-20 at most.<br />&nbsp;<br />**and about your &quot;people recomending using someone else&#039;s wifi just don&#039;t know much about tor&quot; comment, I take no offense and would agree, although I don&#039;t know if I fit in that group as I never recomended it just wanted to bring it to the table so myself and other might learn something.&nbsp; I know I&#039;ve got lots to learn, hence my queries here and more important,&nbsp; practicing whatever information and practices I&#039;ve confirmed to be accurate always and w/out fail. Even if that means I only know to disable JS, I make sure its done before anything else.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again and sorry to OP if my questions hijacked your thread

				I think the only reason to use someone else&#039;s wifi would be to hide the fact that you are using tor in the first place. While ISP&#039;s can&#039;t tell what you are doing with it, they CAN tell that you are using tor. Tor is used by millions of people, so unless you think you are being watched already, just using it is not very incriminating. <br /><br />This is how I understand it, but I&#039;m still learning. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				Why would you give unsuspecting\ innocent folks possible heat who don&#039;t deserve it. There are already enough scammers(buyers and vendors) already. One guy was pondering volunteering at ahomeless shelter, just so he could order bulk product and have it put in these homeless peoples names, then intercept them packages while &quot;voulounteering&quot; at this shelter. This guy is a piece of shit in my opinion. The homeless already have it bad enough, but to possibly make it worse for him\her definitely lets me know where a persons true heart is at. That being said, i don&#039;t think you are even close to the low class of this gentleman i previously mentioned. Just think about what you do and how it could affect whoevers wifi you plan to use legally.
