				Your prices are so good!! .... at these prices/purity and no active cuts by your reviews your on to a winner .I think a little acetone wash would make your C a treat . You could get it tested by pineapple but i think you need to be a vendor for two months before he will test it, but i might be wrong though. 8)<br />I&#039;m always cautious/paranoid about new vendors but when your reviews are a bit stronger i will be a regular customer.<br /><br />GB :o

				Hi GB, <br /><br />Thanks mate :) I have contacted Pineapple and he has said as I am a new vendor to contact him again in a few weeks once we start shipping international orders...will keep you posted. Regarding the acetone test here&#039; part of a review from another member-<br /><br />1 - It does what it is supposed to do. The extent of effects is highy subjective and varies from person to person so no point describing it here. You can see the product here http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/mPAH.jpg<br /><br />2 - No active cuts, no speed, no edgy or jittery feeling.<br /><br />3 - Dissolves in water almost completely, with next to none residue. Good as it will not clogg your nose.<br /><br />4 - Ez test for purity confirms cocaine content quoted by vendor. http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Uvci.jpg<br /><br />5 - Acetone washed 1/3 off the initial 0.3g, which is good as in fact you can easily get rid off cutting agents.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are looking for domesstic mid-grade cocaine. Excellent value for your money, much better than product from the most popular mid grade coke vendor in UK (and cheaper).<br /><br />Hope this helps :)&nbsp;

				I have clicked fan and will try you next time I order some, I just hope its better then disapators as that was a let down along with some one else I can&#039;t remember the name of but basically iv had the same standard as I can get for Â£40 a gram from the next street to where I live. <br />So im a little dubious about buying more just yet lol.<br /><br />Good luck with your business and will see ya when iv topped up again.

				Thanks Kalli,<br /><br />Your welcome to place an order anytime....GayBruceCampbell I&#039;ve got no idea what heeby jeeby is lol but we are not bashing it with anything. We get it from our supplier in kilograms and sell it how it is. We are not overly greedy and would rather do good business... we already have a very healthy offline business so are taking our time building our online customer base. We have been selling the same quality stuff offline for years and everyone&#039;s always been happy, so Im more than confident in the quality. I am not saying it&#039;s 90% pure because its not. But the figure of 60% quoted to us by our supplier seems to have been confirmed so far. And we are eager to get Pineapples lab test results at some point in the near future...so hopefully that will prove the quality for sure. Cheers. Shine69

				I received a sample from Shine69, I was very impressed with the quality! I&#039;m no noob to coke and buy locally and on here. It&#039;s very well priced and very similar price/quality I get on the street! - I&#039;d recommend Shine69&#039;s gear, good weights, good gear, great stealth!<br /><br />Thanks man, I&#039;ll be putting an order in soon!<br /><br />DK23

				I wish i could get 60% cola on my street corner,its like 60 pounds for a 0.6g wrap with 35% Cocaine max and cut with phet where i live :&#039;(4<br />And&nbsp; if i told you where i live you would think it would be decent for the area.Theres a guy selling 0.8gs for 90 locally but i have not tried it and would guess its 60% max.<br /><br />GS :o
