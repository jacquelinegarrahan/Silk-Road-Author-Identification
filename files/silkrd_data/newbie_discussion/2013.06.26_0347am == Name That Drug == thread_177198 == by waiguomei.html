				The last time I had the opportunity to roll was the last time I saw my dealer before he went legit. He gave people like a year&#039;s warning about planning to go legit so I can&#039;t complain much.<br /><br />Visuals were stronger than normal, I felt nauseous before come-up, during the roll, and for 24 hours after. Did not have any other negative effects. Lots of disorientation and not good dizziness.<br /><br />In the end, while high, I ended up throwing out the three remaining pills rather than a) consume them, b) sell them to someone else.<br /><br />I&#039;m a chump who doesn&#039;t test my drugs because my dealer (who was awesome) did test (or at least had been known to test in the past) and, after a really good realtionship that lasted years (five of them) and wasn&#039;t always drug related, I trusted him.<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on making some purchases from here in the very near future.&nbsp; Currently considering 3.5g MDA from 3Jane, 5g MDMA from someone in Germany, and maybe some 2c-b from nawlins.&nbsp; It&#039;s very imporant to me that the substance I&#039;m buying isn&#039;t the same as the substance that was in the &quot;well shit this is obviously cut with something unpleasant pills&quot; that I had last time.<br /><br />Hallucinations I have had on &quot;Ecstasy Pills&quot; (that I&#039;m reasonably certain were MDMA) are similar to the &quot;breathing wall&quot; phenomenon of LSD. On my first roll, I spent a subjective 45 minutes (might not have actually been 45 minutes) communing with a friend&#039;s wall map as the different color and thickness lines (roads, highways, expressways, rivers) pulsed in and out of intensity.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also become awestruck by the beauty in patterned things (especially partially illuminated patterned things) while on MDMA.<br /><br />Having done candy flips twice, and LSD by itself a few more times than that, I suspect trace amounts (under 50ug) of LSD of having been present in some of the pills I got in the past if only because the mild visuals continued past the end of the euphoria to about the length of time that LSD normally takes to wear off.&nbsp; I like LSD and (untested by me pills that I believe my dealer when he says are) MDMA together and I&#039;m positive that the visuals I had were not LSD visuals.<br /><br />Hallucination-wise, the bad pills were more like I was a step or more distant from things (like they were almost but not quite not real).<br />You know how in the Tim Burton&#039;s Alice and Wonderland they added 3D after the fact and everything seems like it&#039;s on a diorama? The bad pills were that kind of almost unreality.<br /><br />So, any ideas... <br /><br />What might be in pills that are claimed as ecstasy that gives disorientation, nausea, and visuals?

Nausea could be from a high caffeine cut?<br />I&#039;ve never experienced nausea from anything that I&#039;ve taken.

				If it made you feel sick like that my guess would be a <br />2cb + dxm mix but that&#039;s just a guess it sounds like a shit pill go back to the dealer and ask to be sure? Or if his selling it as mdxx go get your money back cos that&#039;s shit

				Notwithstanding my dealer going MIA shortly after this incident, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m going to get a refund on pills that I bought and (consumed/threw out) in fall of 2010.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been dry for a long long time.<br /><br />Only stuff I can find around these parts is (claimed to be) K sold by people I neither know nor trust and shitty weed.
