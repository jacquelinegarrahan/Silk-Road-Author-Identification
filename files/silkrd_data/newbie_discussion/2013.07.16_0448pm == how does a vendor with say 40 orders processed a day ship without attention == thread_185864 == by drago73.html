				I mean it must be a hassle, cuz it would look suspicious if i brought 40 packages to one box or even split it up between multiple drop boxes. Cuz then you would run risk driving or riding with all that product in your posession. Just curious.

				Thinking the same thing... They might have people in surrounding towns to divide up the packages and/or different people go in a couple times a day.

				i ship a slot of small parts&nbsp; via USPS - and it&#039;s fairly simple, process and pay for the shipping label online, print the label and slap it on the box. You can order a pickup by USPS for one or a qty of packages or just leave them in the mailbox for the route carrier to pickup when she drops off. Or you can take them and drop them in the post office or in post office drop boxes<br /><br />vendors are probably using a combo of the above

				Buy bulk and mix up where you pre-paid bags comes from, keep track of areas sent too and what stream that bag came from and mix it up.<br />Also ship&nbsp; groups of packages to someone else to send from different city.<br /><br />There is also the return to sender angle, putting the intended address as the return address, or mail forwarding.<br /><br />In terms of LE, most medium or high end operations are run out of one office in each city, so you can take extra precaution when shipping to that area, also in well known neighborhoods that LE work operations that same applies a mail scrutiny is more likely to be a part of their processes there.<br /><br />B

I thought SR clearly state that a &quot;in transit&quot; marking was only suppposed to be done only after dropped in the box? I could have misread that in the wiki. Anyway, vendor has a 99 rating with over 300 transactions as well as being a vendor for a year, so i&#039;m not worried about it.

				It&#039;s all about confidence. You eat a pill nervously in a night-club, every bouncer sees you. Put a piece of chewing-gum in your mouth without a care in the world in the same spot, nobody notices a thing or cares a jot.<br /><br />You process 50 eBay items a day, nobody bats an eyelid. Do so shiftily and everybody notices you.<br /><br />In the UK for non-parcel mail (e.g. letters) you put them in a post box, you don&#039;t need to head to a CCTV-rich Post Office. That helps a lot.<br /><br /><br />Runners are only okay if they do not know who you are, where you are, or how to contact them. Or you have a &quot;grip of death&quot; gang about you. IE not as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />

				Some vendors definitely do mail in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Postal drop boxes work 24/7, and sometimes it is just as convenient to go toss several packages in the box at 2am as it is at 2pm.
