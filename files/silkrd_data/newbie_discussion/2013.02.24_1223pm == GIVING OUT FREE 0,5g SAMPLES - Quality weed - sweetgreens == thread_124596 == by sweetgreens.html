				Hello there my fellow friends!<br /><br />We just set up the vendor account &quot;sweetgreens&quot; one week ago and now we are trying to get into business!<br /><br />We are selling quality weed and we try to get some first transactions and honest feedback.<br /><br />We set up a stealth listing containing an offer for FREE 0,5g samples of one of our strains. You only have to pay the postage.<br /><br />Please feel free to ask me anything you want to know!<br /><br />+++How do you get that link?+++<br />Just sent me a message with your stats here or on SR and I will give you the link to the stealth-listing.<br /><br />+++Can everybody get a sample?+++<br />No.<br />We limited the amount of samples to 10.<br />Also you need at least 5 transactions which worked well to grab a sample.<br /><br />+++Payment / shipping +++<br />You do not have to finalize too early, but as early as possible ;) (Finalize as soon as you received our package)<br />We ship in normal envelopes. The product is packed in two vacuum sealed layers, one of them UV-protected. Each layer is sealed in an other location to prevent ANY smell.<br /><br />+++Vendor Details+++<br />Please visit the link in our signature. This post is just about the samples so we will not post more details about us, since it is all on that vendor page.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest!<br /><br />gg<br />sweetgreens

				I have received and tested the weed.<br /><br /><br />The way they sent it was good.&nbsp; Needs a return address through!&nbsp; Other then that, A+.&nbsp; They are being truthful in the way they describe packing the weed, with &quot;the product is packed in two vacuum sealed layers, one of them UV-protected&quot;.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe at first that there was any weed in there at all.<br /><br />The stuff I got was really dry, it smelled and looked like homegrown commercial weed we get here in the states.&nbsp; I smoked a quarter gram in a pipe, and I can tell you that it&#039;s a strong indica.&nbsp; Not bad at all high-wise.&nbsp; The smell and taste of the smoke aren&#039;t the best, but it does the job well.&nbsp; Something tells me that the legs aren&#039;t gonna be too long with this herb, but it is really to early to tell.<br /><br />Maybe if people ordered a 5gm pack or something, the weed might be better looking..&nbsp; But it&#039;s not on the level of most US grown weed.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />However!&nbsp; I think it was very, very cool of them to send me this sample to try.&nbsp; I am always curious to see what kind of herb people in the EU get, and rarely have the chance to do so.&nbsp; If I was to visit Germany for a week or so, and couldn&#039;t score anything..&nbsp; I would feel comfortable having them send me a couple blunts worth to a hotel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Actually, this weed would be nice in a blunt, now that I think of it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks again for sending over this sample of weed, I hope you do alot of great domestic business.<br /><br />Peace, dog&nbsp; &nbsp;

				After speaking with the vendor I agreed to receive a sample bud for review.&nbsp; Greens was very helpful in answering my questions and made me feel quite confident that we&#039;d have a successful transaction, indeed we did.&nbsp; I received my sample in just three days to the western united states (super fast!).&nbsp; Stealth was perfectly acceptable for a half gram sample and would have been just fine for up to a range of about five grams.&nbsp; The smell is sweet and spicy with a hint of skunk.&nbsp; The taste is a bit green and grassy but not bad.&nbsp; The smoke made me choke but not offensively.&nbsp; I initially thought this was a sativa dominant high type but soon needed to lay down so clearly I had been wrong.&nbsp; This is a good strong indica and it&#039;s a creeper.&nbsp; The buds appear like standard mid grade brick (may just have the brick look from being mailed) and they are seeded.&nbsp; It&#039;s not what I normally expect to see from an indoor grow but it&#039;s not bad at all compared to selections from the commercial/midgrade market.&nbsp; If this was the kind of product I typically purchased I&#039;d have no reservations about doing business with this vendor again.
