				So I ordered from Marlo Stanfield last week and I got the worst dope I have ever tried, it burned my skin and I thought my heart was going to explode. Well, the guy sends out a message in his usual f@cking attitude saying oh sorry it was a bad batch but not to worry I will re send or give you money back.&nbsp; ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?? And the best part about it is that everyone went ahead and changed their feedback for him saying oh he is the best vendor in the world even though he sold me bunk product that could have harmed me.<br /><br />I call bullshit on this guy, and the fact that people play into this and change their feedback are doing a disfavor to the community. I am really pissed off, and no I dont want anything else from this idiot. Go ahead and ban me, there are hundreds of other vendors on here who do not send out bunk batches. WATCH OUT FOR THIS GUY

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about your experience man.&nbsp; I&#039;m not quite sure what he sold you looks to be H judging by his featured listing and your username.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much experience with that drug in particular but I have gotten bad batches of my drug of choice many times via local dealers (non SR).&nbsp; Often times they would make me feel extremely ill and it makes me wonder wtf some people put in their drugs for cut.&nbsp; Anyway best thing you can do at this point is take his refund offer and move on to another vendor that is reputable.

				Dope was weak ONE FUCKING TIME and guess what the man did?<br /><br />SENT ME MORE DOPE. Good dope. Really good. And free coke and molly.<br /><br />He fucked up, and he owned it. Even says so on his vendor page.<br /><br />DO NOT SMEAR THIS MANS NAME. HE IS AN HONEST HARDWORKING VENDOR WHO VENDS A QUALITY PRODUCT.

				You are over reacting! You are right, he is in the wrong for sending out a bad batch but at least he is going above and beyond to make it right. I would take it the reship and get fucked up.&nbsp; BTW he is a stand up vendor. I have been watching him since day one and has made every wrong, right. His dope actually almost killed me from being too good. Also he has changed the way H is sold on here. Before he was on here, a G of powder H was running twice as much as he sells em for.&nbsp; Now alot of vendors have better pricing on their H. Thank him for lower prices, yah junkie!

				Your not the first to say something about the cut he used burning and the quality not being all that either. There are less than a handful of honest dope vendors that sell quality #4 on SR atm, kind of sucks because there is huge demand. Too many vendors charge too much selling #4 cut to shit worse than street corner stamp bags.

But we PAY TO PLAY, dude! He had ONE BAD BATCH and owns up to it almost RIGHT AWAY and scrambles to find another brick so he can replace EVERY order he fucked up on AND sends freebies on top of that?<br /><br />I&#039;m done. This is just pissing me off. The fact that you think you can come on here and try to fuck with his rep with your nonexistent line of reasoning means you probably need to stop getting high.

				This is another vendor, i know who are. You should read my update on my page. Make me a peace offering my dude. I know your taking a beating with all the coke i&#039;ve been selling but to go to stoop to this level is crazy. And tighten up, your very sloppy in what you do.&nbsp; Your damn sure not a newbie and have your own thread. Now i&#039;ll let you slide with out saying your vendor name but contact me and make it right. And apologize in the feedback. And just like other vendors state on their page. We do keep addressees longer. We store them 2 different places. I&#039;m not gonna come fucking hang out with you. But the fact that this person is going to great lengths without contacting me first says alot.&nbsp; Us vendors are suppose to have no recourse of action whenever someone makes up a lie??&nbsp; <br /><br />Edit: Vendor vs Vendor is pathetic. I say i got it for the low. That&#039;s a fact. I say vendors lowered they price after i showed up. Fact. But this guy takes the cake. The first coke i sold on here was just okay, because of who i had to deal with at the time. But now, all my coke is great. And this vendor thats trying to cause problems has good coke also from what i hear. Here&#039;s my suggestion. 5k for slander. I&#039;ll give out free work with it to my customers and free express shipping also donate some to disadvantage kids, You know JIGS or Jiggaboos as you were referring to. This is in no way an attempt to extort but don&#039;t do this dumb shit again. I&#039;ve probably lost business with your stupid fucking feedback. And i don&#039;t think Sr Admin would take kindly to you buying from another account just to slander other vendors. I bet i&#039;m not the first.&nbsp; &nbsp;oh...&quot;Nice Hat by the way&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; ;) ;) ;)

				in response to the OP&#039;s first post. vendor reviews are not worth anything. Almost everyone basicaly blackmails you into giving them 5 stars...?&nbsp; How can that provide any kind of reliable evidence of how a vendor is. I&#039;ve seen 5 stars for orders never recieved and no refunds all because of threats from vendors.&nbsp; As far as that Marlo cat goes, one look at his Ghetto Star Profile page and his pathetic white trash BS about shooting his cousin...&nbsp; Sorry but order from someone like that, what do you expect.&nbsp; I came here to get away from people like him.&nbsp; All you got to do is read his page... he&#039;s pathetic and will spend a good part of his life in jail.

				You&#039;d think that if this is actually a vendor going after another vendor, that it&#039;d be done with more style... instead we get ALL-CAPS racial slurs. Disappointing, isn&#039;t it? You&#039;d think they&#039;d take the time to do something like buy many listings from all different accounts across the US and then do 1/5&#039;s all across the board. But.... nope...

Someone should look into that guy in connection to a vendor. All the top cocaine vendors here&#039;s ratings have taken a dive. If you look at 1 of 5 feedback left on my 3.5 listing then look at the 1 of 5 on 10toes and KingofTrill, they sound like the same idiot in the past couple weeks. Or maybe I&#039;m wrong. But one persons rating has barely taking a dip. And it was a complaint about the price of an eightball.

My customer service conversation is between an Amazon employee and the russian guy from the Capital One commercial. (See I&#039;m Human) I&#039;m not buying this shit for one sec. I&#039;ll say it again. I know which vendor you are and you know i know. Apology time now that there&#039;s a name and a face to put with that. (Applause)&nbsp; I&#039;m going in stealth soon but before i go i plan to bring your business to its knees. Not by buying your product and thrashing it or bad mouthing you. But, by offering almost half price of every product you have. Hell, I&#039;ll reach out and get some bth just for the hell of it. I&#039;m low on coke at the moment but I&#039;ll make sure we pick through the bricks we get and the shiniest most smelly ones will be offered. You got a week or 2 tops. I can&#039;t upload pics anymore, don&#039;t know if its a glitch or sr has removed them privileges from me because of this situation. I totally understand if they did. On another note, I have another buyer that isn&#039;t a vendor who i believe has tipped off LE and another one who&#039;s just claiming the most random shit (buys an item has it shipped to his homeboy in another state, then claims his homeboy said it was short. So now i have to take his word). Not only are you degenerates not willing to come to an agreement of any sort, you want to scream the craziest racial shit, I could be an Indian guy from MUMBAI, Give a Fuck. What difference would it make? So, Fuck Your Apology. In the most polite terms.

				Marlo has been OUTSTANDING in multiple transactions with me.&nbsp; Look at my history, I have been on here over 1.5 years with buying stats at the very top.&nbsp; I have always been honest.&nbsp; I have tremendous credit to Tetra (going way back), GOA (one of the greatest ever and all around good guy/gal) and I received bunk from SkippyJiff (I relayed my experience on here about his product – I believe he is now long gone).<br />For Marlo, I appreciate the pricing that will not break the bank and his product was as much “fishscale” as I have ever purchase.<br /><br />Only one request Marlo….I have a 7g in “processing” (different buyers name vs forum name – starts with a “W”)&nbsp; All ok with it?&nbsp; Be sure to keep me on your list if you go stealth…..which I would actually like to see you do.&nbsp; Keep you from having spend the time and effort on jackasses like the few on here.&nbsp; As long as I am on the list :)<br /><br />
