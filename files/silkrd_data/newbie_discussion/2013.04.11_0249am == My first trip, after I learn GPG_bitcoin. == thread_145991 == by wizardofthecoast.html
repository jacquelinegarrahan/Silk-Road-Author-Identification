				I never thought I&#039;d actually see this day. I had long ago given up the dream of ego-death. Because of my place in time it&#039;s quite difficult to acquire anything that&#039;s considered mind expanding. Thanks to the bravery of vendors on markets like SR, I know that within the coming weeks, I can scratch one off my bucket list. I think I&#039;m going to miss my personal solar cycle/ favorite time of the year date, (atm, i don&#039;t even know how far the innuedo should go to avoid identification), but I&#039;m just so happy I finally found a way to acquire psychedelics. I&#039;ve had struggled in the past few years, with motivation for broadening my horizons amid looming social hierarchical failures in the transit to an open source planet. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve often wondered how to best affect the world, whether it be finish that book half written from high school, take the years of classical guitar study out into the yard so the neighbors have good background music, or engaging in popularization or awareness of the abundance we face as a technological society; the point is, I never meant to watch it pass me by. Kudos for such a forum. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Truly appreciative of everyone who has invested the time and awareness it takes to have a community like this.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forum:wizardofthecoast, and SR: aeofellives ; message me if u have a link to a tutorial you&#039;ve used when<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;preparing for a first bitcoin purchase.
