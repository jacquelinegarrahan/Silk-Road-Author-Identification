				Even though I&#039;m a linux nerd and know all about cryptography and am a big fan of GNUPG, I had never heard of Tor.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found out about SR simply by searching &quot;buy drugs online&quot; and looking at the first article that came up in the search results.&nbsp; The first thing I did was download Tor and then find out the URL for this place.

				Every year The Guardian (a mainstream liberal-left UK broadsheet newspaper) and Mixmag (a UK dance music magazine) organise a drug-use survey to track how people&#039;s drug use is changing over time. Not sure if it&#039;s UK only, or if they advertise it in other countries. Anyhow, I ALWAYS fill it out, doing my part to show that not all drug users are mental crack-heads destined for oblivion, that the vast majority of drug-users are just like people you meet every day, that they ARE people you&#039;d meet everyday and never know. <br /><br />So this year one of the questions was &#039;have you ever bought drugs from the Silk Road?&#039;. Eh, I thought, not yet but I&#039;m gonna! I was already familiar with Tor (I already had Tor on my phone), so finding it was easy once I knew it was there. Biggest arse-ache to date has been getting bitcoins....<br /><br />So fucking happy - the internet is awesome!&nbsp; ;D

				Found SR through a friend who found it online by being a huge internet geek and spending most of his free time on different forums (which I guess I&#039;m doing now, so who am I to judge?).&nbsp; <br />I think its the greatest thing in the world, but I&#039;m concerned about it getting too much publicity.<br />I think that if the major cable news media found out about SR and started running stories, they would only be negative, as Oeufalacoke points out.&nbsp; I could just see a prime time Fox story about how &quot;this black market internet site is flooding our country with drugs, and its happening right under our noses&quot;.&nbsp; That would scare the soccer moms of America, as does everything they don&#039;t understand, and they would put pressure on LE to start cracking down.&nbsp; Then you would have LE infiltrating the site (much more than the do already), and placing orders, learning what type of packages to look for, customs prosecuting anyone they can catch to the full extent, etc.<br />Anyone agree that SE is better off staying under the radar?<br /><br />

Attract to much attention and more pressure will come to stop it! <br /><br />I found SR because it was on headline news on TV for selling guns. After a bit of research i found out that all you needed was tor and a link and i was away... I feel part of something great and it still feels a bit surreal. However i don&#039;t mention it to any1 not even my mates and i have kept my new contact quiet!

				Someone on a clearnet forum I am part of briefly mentioned the ability to buy drugs online and posted the process to access SR, they turned around and 10 minutes later deleted it. I just happened to be there and caught it.<br /><br />That was August of 11, I then did some research and logged on a few week later obtained my 1st BTC and made my 1st purchase, it&#039;s been downhill ever since then.

				Six months ago, while sitting through a boring movie I decided to google random thoughts. I googled &quot;buy illegal drugs online&quot; and the first result was the gawker article. Out of the thousands of googles that I have done in my lifetime that has by far been the best.

				This is sad for SR but, it was a front page article in a national newspaper, complete witha screen grab of the Sr home page.<br />Ti was talking about the &#039;evils&quot; I said to myself YESSSSSSS! and got on-board

				Funny as Fuck...... most people stumbled upon smooth as silk road by googling&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;buy drugs online&quot; I was actually trying to buy pure pharma.. methamphetamine , methedrine but it was only in 5mg doses and expensive as hell.&nbsp; Silk Road has been an absolute revelation for me as I think it has for most of the fellow fiends here.. I average three hours a day... more on the weekends I just cant get enough just wish sometimes the forums and marketplace would load a bit quicker though... mainly an issue logging in

				I found silk road from hearing about a&nbsp; 17 year old computer nerd in my town who supplied my whole town with MDMA during last summer (the concert season). I&#039;m a big fan of computers and drugs so i thought: If this kid can do it, so can I (im 21). So, I learned the whole process from a friend of mine who knew about tor and bitcoins, and here I am. Some people treat me as a genius because I can safely use this site. If only they knew how easy it was hahahahah
