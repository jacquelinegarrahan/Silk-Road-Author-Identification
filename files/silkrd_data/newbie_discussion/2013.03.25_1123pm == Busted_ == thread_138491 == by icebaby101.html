				I&#039;&#039;m just wanting to know if anyone on this forum has ever actually got busted ordering from SR. I know alot of people on this site are extremely cautious/paranoid etc.. but it would be interesting to know if any user on here actually has got caught cause i haven&#039;t heard.

				And you most likely wont hear from them. Just think about it; if they got busted and are doing time - no SR. Even if they get busted with a small ammount, if they are smart enough wont share every detail of their bust and potentially reveal more details (unvanted messages, posts....) that would harm them.

				I plan to just say someone must have ordered here because I trolled them too hard on Facebook. Though I suspect they will not confiscate it in the mail but wait for me to open an order and bust my door down. As Ned Kelly said: such is life.

				<br />I just can&#039;t believe a lot of vendors suggest to use a real name.<br /><br />And, even offer signature required shipping.<br /><br />they just don&#039;t care if you go to jail or not.<br /><br />all they care is about losing their money.<br /><br />SR Buyer&#039;s guide clearly says to use a fake name for deniability.

				Let&#039;s just say.. for reasons i don&#039;t want to give out... i can&#039;t get it delivered to my home address.. if i got it sent to a PO BOX would there be a higher chance of getting caught? especially with your real name on it ?..because sometimes they require ID to pick it up

				If someone got busted (other then the dumbass in Australia or those 2 dumbfuck frat kids), logging onto SR or SR forum will be the LAST thing on their mind. <br />Lawyering up, cleaning their tracks, cleaning their home, explaining to their wife/kids/parents/employers why they caught a charge receiving an 8ball in the mail.<br />Other then that, as it&#039;s been repeated ad nauseum, it&#039;s extremely difficult to be &quot;busted&quot; because of SR. It&#039;s possible to get busted for some IRL slip up that coincides with your SR contraband in some way, but but not using SR to make a purchase and having it sent to you. And also, don&#039;t order more then personal amounts at a time. You are not Pablo Escobar, please don&#039;t try to order 20 kilos in the mail.

				Seriously do a google search and see if there is a name other than yours associated with your address. I get mail all the time from like 4 people that used to live here... let them get &quot;busted&quot;

				I agree player but unfortunately i don&#039;t have that choice i&#039;m new to this town and pretty much don&#039;t know anyone. I have to order to my address but i don&#039;t use my real name like the guy also said that&#039;s foolish. If a mail person ever comes to have me sign a package i&#039;m going full retard saying that person does not live here i have no clue who they are please return to sender lmao..

				You take the possibility of legal trouble in your own hands everytime you deal with something illegal. Whether it is SR as a buyer or seller, or FTF transactions. I&#039;m sure people have been busted, but unless the person has some useful info on their specific situation and how others can avoid it, I doubt you will hear about it here.

				Things rarely get seized but sometimes it happens, once something gets seized authorities sometimes won&#039;t pursue it beyond a letter from customs. However people certainly do get busted, look up the statistics on drugs found in the mail. It isn&#039;t a lot compared to how much is sent but it still happens. <br />I can think of some examples but would rather not mention them specifically.<br />The best thing you can do if you plan on ordering large amounts of things or from overseas frequently is to work on some good drops. For small amounts of domestic products it doesn&#039;t matter as much, the cops might knock on&nbsp; your door and ask you about it but they won&#039;t really give a shit about an eight ball of coke or a quarter of weed unless you make it really easy to bust you and admit to everything right away.<br />Every drop has weaknesses but the idea is to make it harder for them to bust you, if they&#039;re willing to put int he work you will get busted. But you&#039;d really have to be fucking around with bulk for that to be a problem. <br /><br />Be safe and don&#039;t be careless, carelessness is what gets people busted.

				Slim to none chance of people getting busted ordering off SR.&nbsp; I&#039;d keep weight under a pound for anything, any more than that I&#039;m dealin direct.&nbsp; Small shit the cops probably won&#039;t pursue hardly at all unless you fall for the tell on yourself trick.
