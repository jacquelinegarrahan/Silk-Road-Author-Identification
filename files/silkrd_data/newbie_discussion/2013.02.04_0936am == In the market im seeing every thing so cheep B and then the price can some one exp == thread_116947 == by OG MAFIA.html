				Hello OG Mafia,<br /><br />You&#039;re new, excited, and your mind is abuzz with the possibilities that appear to have opened up before you now that you&#039;ve discovered TOR and the Silk Road. The thrill you probably experienced when you first got the login page of Silk Road to render is just one of quite a few thrills you&#039;re going to have to experience if you intend to make this work for you.<br /><br />You&#039;ve learned how to access TOR hidden sights. That&#039;s a start, but it&#039;s been made fairly simple and convenient these days, and there&#039;s no longer a substantial technical barrier to getting your first peek at the dark net. I&#039;ll assume you&#039;re excited and raring to go, but before you do anything else there are a couple of things you&#039;re going to need to learn.<br /><br />Learn to use a search engine. Things you&#039;ve been asking about in the newbie forum are answered in countless places on the web, and in quite a few forum posts and sticky threads. Asking people questions will only get you so far, and people are more likely too help if it&#039;s obvious that you&#039;ew putting in some effort to teach yourself.<br /><br />Learn about bitcoin. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that relies on cryptography to allow passing tokens securely from one person to another. It&#039;s not untraceable and in fact has excellent transaction logging, or it wouldn&#039;t work at all, but careful users of bitcoins are able to buy and sell things without their bitcoin identities being associated wit their real-world person.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to be able to perform the cryptographic functions with a pencil and paer, but you do need a grip on the limitations of bitcoin and how to use them safely.<br />Visit mtgox.com and watch the exchange rate graphs. Get a handle on the fluctuting value of bitcoins versus your local currency.<br />Use Google to search for beginner&#039;s guides to bitcoin.<br /><br />Learn about key pair cryptography, specifically PGP. Used properly it&#039;s an excellent and reasonably simple way to have private conversations on the net. Use it poorly and you&#039;re exposing yourself to risk.<br /><br />Spend a lot of time in the Security forum here. Pretty much everything you need to know is either explained in there, talked about in there, or provided through links to external resources.<br /><br />It&#039;s exciting, sure, but unless you arm yourself with a decent working knowledge of the essentials of safe conduct on the dark web, you&#039;re very likely to get yourself into serious trouble.&nbsp; And if after spending a few days reading it all seems like too much hard work, then please do seriously consider just opting out and not playing this game. If you can&#039;t be bothered to learn enough to protect yourself then it&#039;s all but inevitable that you&#039;ll unknowingly do something that potentially fucks of the rest of your life.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ll climb down from my soap box and bid you good day.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I forget where it&#039;s located specifically, but in one of the subforums here is a post all about PGP. It might take a while to get the hang of it.

There&#039;s no shortcut. <br />You have to read the helpfiles and the pgp sticky thread here in the newbie forum.<br /><br />PGP is an encryption method. It enables you to send info to vendors (such as your address) securely.<br /><br />There is a wealth of knowledge in the forums all about how to buy bitcoins, and how to fund your SR wallet.<br /><br />It may all seem very confusing and frustrating to begin with, which it kinda is, BUT persevere. Read, read, read, then comprehend.<br /><br />You could even make a test purchase, to ensure you had fully understood the process.<br />An E-book, lottery ticket, etc..&nbsp;

				PGP does improve security and is wise but is not requires. Most vendors dont require it but, it adds an extra layer of safety.

One vendor I used didn&#039;t have a key, but after several customers said they wouldn&#039;t order unless he set one up, he in-fact did set one up.<br />Personally, I feel just that little bit more secure when using pgp encryption.

				I never place an order without encrypting the address through PGP.<br />I feel much safer. In fact, I won&#039;t order from a vendor who doesn&#039;t provide a public key.<br />I figure if the vendor won&#039;t go to the (very little) effort of setting up PGP, then their shipping methods and computer security probably isn&#039;t that secure either, even if their product is great and they&#039;re legit.
