				a few years ago i realized how much gear i was wasting. i would run average lines about 6 to 8 inches long. but by doing this, most of the vapor i inhaled was just being exhaled without getting absorbed through my lungs. so i tried out doing shorter lines, i now run my lines only 2 or 3 inches. my gear lasts way more longer. before if i was rattling i would have to run 8 to 10 lines at 6 to 8 inches long before i was feeling good. running short lines at 2 or 3 inches i still only need 8 or 10 lines to see me good. <br /><br />so i figure its like if i run a 3 inch line, i still see some unabsorbed vapor breathe out when i exhale. so maybe i only absorb like 50% of the vapor i inhale. but if i do 6 inch lines then i prolly only absorb 25% of my gear that i inhale. so all those years i was probably wasting like 75%+ of my gear. <br /><br />and by doing much shorter lines i can make a small .2 bag last for ages. i have a friend who uses a huge fucking length of foil, like at least 12 or 14 inches long, maybe even longer. i guess its just natural greed as a drug addict you want to get that gear in you as quick as you possibly can. but most people don&#039;t realize that your lungs can only absorb so much in one lungful, the rest is just blown out into the air where you can never get it back again. my friend will go through a .2 bag in like 5 or 10 minutes max. <br /><br />i actually tear off a piece of foil about 4 inches wide and maybe 10 inches long and run the lines sideways across the foil. kinda like...<br /><br />______________________________<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/\&nbsp; &nbsp;/\&nbsp; &nbsp;/\&nbsp; &nbsp; /\&nbsp; &nbsp; /\&nbsp; &nbsp; /\&nbsp; &nbsp;/\&nbsp; &nbsp; /\&nbsp; &nbsp; /<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; \ /&nbsp; \ /&nbsp; \ /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ /&nbsp; &nbsp;\ /<br />______________________________<br /><br />if you do long lines then you should definitely try this out. you&#039;ll see your gear lasts a lot longer. you get at least 2 or 3 times as many runs up and down the foil, yet each line is just as effective.
