				Random question for someone who knows more than me; How is it that ammo can be shipped so easily? Wouldn&#039;t it have to be classified as explosive therefore giving the package a HUGE red flag anyway?

				I dont think TOR is the best place to purchase arms. I&#039;d prefer a gun show. Preferably in a southern state because they have less gun control regulations. Anyone know of any ongoing gun shows that are safe to purchase discreetly?

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There was this hidden service floating around for ages called israservice. They had listings for a ridiculous amount of guns at some pretty bewildering prices that they claimed to be shipping from Israel all around the world. I always figured they were a scam, but I was on their mailing list for ages and they were constantly sending out updated inventories and their .onion site was updated daily and they always responded to messages pretty quickly. If it was a scam it was a good one.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately I agree with morphjow, make love, not war fellas.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I agree with Jack MeHoff, there are plenty of legal ways to get a gun via the clearnet.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For illegal guns, you can find your way into a major US city, find a drug-set block.&nbsp; You can even ask the locals, tbh, most will actually point you in the right direction as far as where to go.&nbsp; Then ask the &quot;homies&quot; if they can get you a &quot;throw-away&quot; ...

I believe that in the future it will be better to use a SR type system to buy them. Is buying drugs on SR more &quot;shady&quot; then buying them in person? <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I am all for FTF private sales in the US but that doesn&#039;t make buying guns online pointless. If someone is paying the money for the weapon then obviously they believe it is worth it.<br /><br />Just because someone wants to remain anonymous does not mean they are up to no good. It means they value their privacy. Privacy isn&#039;t only for criminals. There is no reason to suspect someone of wanting to hurt someone else just because they want anonymity. If I were selling a gun to someone and they were talking about all the innocent people they were going to murder with it then I wouldn&#039;t sell it to them either.<br /><br />I am not huge on fetching citations but here are some simple numbers I have quickly found.<br />In 2010 there were 11078 gun homicides in the US.<br />55544 non-fatal gun injuries in 2011.<br />138336 gun assaults in 2011.<br />Total of ~205k.<br />There are ~270,000,000 privately owned guns in the US.<br /><br />~0.08% of guns in the US were used in a crime then (rough numbers) assuming the same gun was never used for more then one crime.<br />I suppose I should have said ~99.9% rather then 99.99% in my original statement, but fairly accurate.<br /><br /><br />Edit: I don&#039;t know if homicides and non-fatal gun injuries are also included in gun assaults. If so, then the percentage of guns used in crimes is even lower. I think the point is clear though: the vast majority of guns in America are silent.
