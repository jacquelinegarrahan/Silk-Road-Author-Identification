				Sometimes it&#039;s just a matter of being extra patient. All the attention to BTC flutuations has probably caused a huge inflow of business for SR vendors and you have to remember a vendor could be in any part of the planet, they&#039;re not necessarily in the counties they sell out of.<br /><br />Ironically you may receive better services from a smaller vendor with less sales under his/her belt, since they are both eager to increase their volumes and they attract less custom.

				thanks Pine, i thought about it having to do with the fluctuations. it sucks because i payed 50 bucks for .25 bitcoin a week ago, made an order, dude sat on my order, then all this happens and my order is now worth .37 coins or something. i thought he had raised his prices at first haha. im hoping hell still send me my whole thing for the same price it was on monday, but i dont know. <br /><br />im not sure if either of you answered this question though,&nbsp; &nbsp; is there no way that the buyer can cancel an order at this point or is it completely left to the vendor?<br />and do any of you have experience with ordering something&nbsp; then it being removed? i go to my order, click the item, then it just says this item is no longer listed. which is terribly upsetting :/

				i am in the same boat if you mouseover cancel it says in 4 days you will have that option. If he accepts the order before then money is in escrow and you have to wait and see if you get your stuff if not resolve with SR. Here&#039;s my problem what if a vendor is waiting on you order for 4 days and cancels it bitcoin was 250 then now it&#039;s 75.<br />Does unheged and hedged option affect this.
