				GET EM RIGHT HERE!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=215743.0 <br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />Well, two strings attached:<br /><br />1. leave me good feedback!<br />2. International shipping is like $3, sorry<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />UPDATES 9/29<br /><br />1. For the 20 people who got in on my original free 5strip sample, you will instead be receiving a free 10strip. Because I care. Enjoy =D<br /><br />2. I have every intention of shipping everyones free samples out tomorrow (monday), however, the hottest girl I&#039;ve ever fucked JUST came back into my life, and she&#039;s coming to sleep over, and there IS a possibility I won&#039;t be able to go to the post office tomorrow, in which case I will go on Tuesday at the ABSOLUTE latest. Sorry guys, but remember, they are free samples.<br /><br />3. This update is in regards to three people in particular, you know who you are. One person ordered the last 2 listings of the free 5-strip. I specified one per account. As such, instead of getting a free 10strip now like everyone else (or two tenstrips like he tried), he will only get two tabs. On a related note, two people have ordered two free samples of the free 2 tabs instead of one order of them. Again, I specified one free sample listing per account. As such, these two people will only get 1 free tab. You know who you are, I kept my descriptions concise, please follow my directions if you expect me to ship you free shit. <br /><br />4. I have decided that I will keep this listing for free samples of 2 tabs up until one week before Halloween. So, this listing will close on October 24. Be sure to stock up (not on samples, buy some!), and you and your friends can celebrate the time honored tradition of Tripoween!<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />I just came accross a large quantity of 25-c blotter, and I am so confident that you guys will love my product that I&#039;ll give out two tabs FREE of charge with FREE shipping, because I know that many of you will come back as repeat customers.<br /><br />From what I understand, 25-c and 25-b are the best chemicals in the Nbome family (most euphoric, least body load, fairly in control of yourself, wild visual hallucinations), with 25-I lagging behind with a higher body load and less euphoria. From what people tell me, 25-c is just as euphoric as 25-b, except the body load is slightly lessened, and the visual hallucinations are marginally &quot;better&quot;... not more of them, but of a higher quality. <br /><br />I strive to have the highest quality product on the market (and I do. Try some. For free.), and I also aim to offer the most competitive prices for the products I&#039;m selling and will sell on this marketplace.<br /><br />ENJOY YOUR FREE SAMPLES!<br /><br />Limited to one sample per account.<br /><br />

				Hey Opanthalgic thanks for this offer..I actually placed a sample order with you a couple of days ago and its still showing processing. Also it was for 5 tabs, but I noticed in this thread you say 2. So would I be receiving 5 or 2 lol? Thanks! :)

				You got a PGP key, Opanthalgic? I&#039;ve added the samples to my cart but I don&#039;t see a PGP key anywhere for you. I don&#039;t really like putting my address in without encrypting it. I&#039;d love to sample though if you&#039;re PGP compliant. :D

				Sweet, thanks for the sample! Haven&#039;t tried 25-C yet, but I&#039;ll be back for more if I like it!<br />I only wish I&#039;d got on the free 5 tabs!<br /><br />Also, is encryption such a big deal when it&#039;s a legal drug?

It&#039;s really not as hard as it seems.
