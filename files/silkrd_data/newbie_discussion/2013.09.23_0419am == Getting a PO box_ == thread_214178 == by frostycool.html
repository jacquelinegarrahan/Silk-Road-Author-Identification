				Title: <strong>Getting a PO box?</strong><br />

				So I&#039;m considering getting a PO box to have my stuff sent there instead of my place. I live with 2 roommates so I don&#039;t want to get them involved with this kind of stuff and would rather be solely responsible. I&#039;ve read around that PO boxes are pretty safe. I just want to know would it be fishy if I suddenly go to open one up and only use it for SR purposes? Or should I mix in some other purchases in there too be extra safe? I don&#039;t plan on buying in crazy bulk orders at all, just some personal sized orders whenever I need. Also, could anyone suggest a good size? I don&#039;t know how this stuff really works yet so I don&#039;t know what size package vendors put orders in. Obviously would depend on how much you order, but if I&#039;m doing mostly personal orders (so not too big) would 5x5 work? Total noob here so just trying to be extra cautious before I get into it &amp; all.

				I read not to because it requires more information. Whereas if you send it to current location, it&#039;s less suspicious and you could always deny deny deny. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve thought about doing this because I&#039;m currently staying at my parent&#039;s place for a little while, however the thought of having to pick my drugs up at the post office makes me more nervous than just getting tiny domestic orders sent to my house in my real name. You have to show your ID and all that shit. My ID does have my old address on it, but they might want proof of residency in your local area? I&#039;m not sure... just seems like too much info to me. Me and my mom order shit online all the time anyway so I feel safer just ordering to my house. Only thing I have to worry about is getting to the mail before they do. I just plan to never order internationally or anything above like a gram of anything.<br /><br />Also I have a friend who lives in student housing (apartments) and has made multiple small orders to his real name/address with no problems. Once again, it&#039;s all about ordering domestic, personal amounts and paying special attention to any comments about stealth in vendor reviews. I wouldn&#039;t fuck with a vendor who gets bad reviews for stealth.<br /><br />Also I wouldn&#039;t worry about your roommates taking any blame. If any shit goes down I don&#039;t see how they could charge anyone but the person receiving the mail, if even that. Remember what we&#039;re always told: If you&#039;re especially nervous, write return to sender on it and leave it for a couple days.

				This is the system I use....not saying its the best, but it&#039;s how I&#039;ve done it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pay for a business PO box that you have a friend go and open, using his information (he will never go pick up mail there, it will just be his information on the box).&nbsp; Have another friend (or you), pick up the mail in the box.&nbsp; Or else if you want to use your own information on the box, whenever you have an &quot;iffy&quot; package to pick up, you send a receiver over to get that mail for you, whose ID information is completely different from the ID information the box is registered to.

				Will USPS usually just leave the package in the mailbox/at the doorstep? Usually when I get packages I order from online they ring the bell and sometimes don&#039;t deliver it if no one answers. I know not to ever sign for them also. If they just drop it in the mailbox, that would make my life easier.

A 5x5 should be plenty.
