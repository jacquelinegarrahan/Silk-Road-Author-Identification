				So I used to think getting the tracking number was a good idea. I have read a few things since then and wanted to put it out there and see what people think. <br />For customers getting a tracking number is a good idea because you can check to see if your item has in fact been shipped and where its at in its delivery. You can check to see when its going to arrive.<br />For vendors a tracking number is good for them to make sure an item was delivered and in some cases prove an item was delivered.<br /><br />There is the thought though that if you get a customer who uses TOR to check the tracking number (probably constantly which could be a red flag itself no?) and anyone LE or otherwise who is watching they are going to put 2 and 2 together when it comes to TOR and shipping. Maybe the customer doesnt use TOR to check the tracking but somehow they themselves are being watched and this alerts LE to the shipment. It could be just the customer that gets in trouble or maybe they look at when that was shipped out and go back and see on the video/records that quite a few other packages were shipped out by the same person at that time so maybe they go after all the other shipments by tracking number and if they have the ability the vendor. Maybe they will bust the current shipments and wait until the vendor comes in with another batch then its those new customers too that get caught up.<br /><br />So I get a little apprehensive when I see that a vendor gives his customers the tracking numbers. I want them to get one I just dont think it should be given out unless there is a claim. A lot of vendors do just that. So I thought I would put it out there for comments and thoughts.

				That makes sense. So they have a confirmed delivery. Tracked. <br />Without a tracking number though how is a vendor to show an item shipped?<br />So the buyer doesnt try to say it didnt come and so a vendor has to send.

				I personally like getting tracking numbers.&nbsp; i like to know where my item is in transit.&nbsp; as long as you&#039;re careful with them it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; also, i don&#039;t think it would matter if it&#039;s LE tracking the package since they&#039;d still have no proof that you were actually the one who ordered.&nbsp; i&#039;ve heard of some people who get their package and write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it and then don&#039;t open it for a while so that if they were asked about it they could just say they didn&#039;t open it because they didn&#039;t order anything and were planning to take it to the post office the next time they went out, or something.

				I like that last piece you said about &quot;return to sender&quot;. As far as customers getting their tracking numbers like I said in the first post I think this endangers a lot of people. <br />Anyone with real knowledge on if what i said is correct? Is giving customers a tracking number a bad thing?<br />I think that a vendor should get one even though I was just reminded of how a tracking number would work well for LE. That is for my benefit though I guess. If I dont get my package and need to make a claim.<br />What to do?

				I&#039;m going to be getting tracking numbers for my packages, but I don&#039;t plan to check them unless there is a delivery issue or a dispute. <br />I&#039;ve read that you shouldn&#039;t check tracking numbers from Tor, so if I ever need to check the tracking for any reason I&#039;ll go to an internet cafe.

				Thanks for the tips about cops using tracking numbers, that definitely makes me more wary about sellers who use them. Personally, I like getting a tracking number if I was ordering a package that wasn&#039;t at risk of interception, but I wouldn&#039;t want there to be a record of me checking a tracking number on a package I had to deny knowing about. That hurts the whole &#039;plausible deniability&#039; thing so I definitely won&#039;t be checking tracking if I do get a number provided to me.<br /><br />I can understand some vendors wanting the number to verify that they sent the package so you can&#039;t say they didn&#039;t, but at the same time I think it&#039;s better to play it safe and they could just keep the receipt they get from the post office showing that they mailed it, even if they can&#039;t guarantee that it was delivered they can guarantee that it was sent out.

				I&#039;m surprised that sellers offer tracking numbers tbh, surely it just makes it riskier for them as if their packages get intercepted it&#039;s just another piece of evidence that helps the cops locate them.

				Good for the vendor and good for the buyer.....<br /><br />If the vendor has shipped it, and the buyer has received the item but says they haven&#039;t. Use to vendors advantage.&nbsp; But if the vendor ships, and lets the buyer know a date when to expect but doesn&#039;t arrive on that date, i feel the vendor should go ahead and release the tracking number.<br /><br />Buyer----It&#039;s always good to know when to expect a package, not just word of mouth from a vendor

				I used to think its a good idea, but it seems like a crutch.&nbsp; You look at tracking all day long to see updates.<br /><br />Pretty stressful.&nbsp; I just stop worrying about it now

				From what i&#039;ve read here and there tracking numbers should always be obtained by the seller but not shared to the buyer unless the package is late or theres some disagreement about what happened. I&#039;ve been told the act of checking (not obtaining) the tracking data is logged and reviewed. Not sure if thats true or not but its food for thought.

Alot of people are checking their tracking numbers for Ebay etc. you are right but how many of them are using TOR?<br />*<br /><br />Also after reading all the other responses I thought I would say I think a vendor should have a tracking number but only produce it in the event of a dispute. I wont order unless the vendor gets a tracking number.<br /><br />As far as a vendor who is LE goes if they have your address is the tracking number going make that much of a difference? Solution-order from well known reputable vendors that have been here a long time.<br /><br />I was told Priority requires a tracking number now. Its no longer optional. I think this is good for those vendors that are looking to scam (mostly newbies).<br /><br />First class mail is just an excuse to selective scam in my opinion.<br /><br />Never FE and check the forums before you order and only order from the most reputable according to the forums NOT the ratings/reviews. <br /><br />Dont be the first to test anything wait for others reviews and for some time for the vendor to become known. Would you buy from your fellow newbie? What is they became a vendor overnight? So think about who you are sending your information out to.<br /><br />Once you are not a newbie and you have some transaction history to speak of you can start learning how to get testers and try out new vendors but to try it as a newbie I think is dangerous. <br /><br />Being a newbie a vendor can selective scam you claiming your low transaction history or the fact that you are a newbie (even if they are too) as their reasoning/proof.<br /><br />Go with what is well known and established as working at first then learn how to safely venture outside that after you know what you are doing :-*
