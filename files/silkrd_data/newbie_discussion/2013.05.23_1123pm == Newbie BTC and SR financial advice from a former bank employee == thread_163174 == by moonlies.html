				I AM CROSS POSTING THIS IN THE SAFETY FORUM AFTER I GET 50 POSTS. EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS.<br /><br />BTC and SR Financial Advice from a former major national bank employee:<br /><br />I typed up the most relevant information, but feel free to ask many, many questions. I did NOT work at BofA, so this advice may not completely apply to those who use BST, but is generally applicable across all large national banks.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the story:<br /><br />I used to be a bank teller. I was hired by a large, national bank that is nationwide and must follow all governmental regulations typical of a large financial institution. I acquired some knowledge during my employment that may be of use to the people of Silk Road regarding Bitcoins, and the way the government tracks money as well as specially designated &quot;drug traffickers&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot; using these large bank systems.<br /><br />The United States government is very interested in tracking the financial behavior of &quot;narcotics traffickers&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;, and it does so with the help of large national banks. The US government does this with a database of people that are designated &quot;narcotics traffickers&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot;. I still do not know what you have to do to get on this list (or why you can be on the list and not in prison…?), but the list exists and I have encountered these individuals on only a few, but very rememberable occasions.<br /><br />Yes, there is a list of people who are considered &quot;drug traffickers&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot; that is given to all branches of all large national banks by the federal government. I am not sure from which department of the federal government, but this list carries names that the United States government to be considered either &quot;narcotics traffickers&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot;. (an example of this would be the Boston bombers, both of these individuals were on this list under &quot;terrorist&quot;, though I am not sure how heavy their &quot;watch&quot; was). These are the only two qualifications to be on this list. If your name is on this list, the agency involved is notified every time you do a transaction at one of these large national banks, and there are simply some transactions you are not allowed to do. The degree of this depends on how heavy the government has placed its &quot;watch&quot; on you. I am not sure of the different levels or the qualifications for these different levels of &quot;being watched&quot;, only that they do exist.<br /><br />First of all, it was communicated to me during my employment that these lists are not particularly difficult to be on, and once on the list it is very difficult, and near impossible to get off. Usually by the time you realize the government has you on this list you are in a prison cell.<br /><br />Tellers are instructed through every step of every transaction by their computer screen. The computer will immediately notify the Teller if the individual in front of them who has properly identified themselves is on this list. From here, the computer system will either advise the teller to place a &quot;watch&quot; on this transaction so it can be reviewed later by the proper authorities, to do nothing, or the computer system will essentially lock the teller out of doing anything and force a manager to be involved.<br /><br />I do know that it is absolutely possible for the bank to watch all transactions on an account and keep lists and lists and files and files of all deposits. That deposit slip that you fill out at the bank and give to the teller with all the &quot;fake&quot; info? That slip is scanned by an image capturing device and the paper itself is designed to pick up fingerprints. Next time you&#039;re talking to the teller, look directly above your head. There is at least one camera pointing at your face at any time in a bank, guaranteed. That deposit slip is also time stamped, so if ANYONE (the bank, the authorities, etc.) wants to see who really made that deposit they can, regardless of what &quot;fake&quot; info you used.<br /><br />It is not illegal to buy Bitcoins, but that doesn&#039;t mean that the US government can&#039;t ask the banks to watch specific accounts of individuals and corporations who may be suspected of being involved with drug trafficking. I do not know for sure, as I was terminated before I could look up a BTC vendor account, but these accounts may be easily flagged by the bank for further review of all transactions. The bank is not on your side, they are on the government&#039;s side as the government is the entity that regulates the banks, which in essence controls how much money they can make. Banks like money, so banks willingly comply with all government agencies.<br /><br />In this same vein, the US is huge and very, very full of itself and money. In other words, unless you are doing very very large BTC transactions very often, or very very frequent transactions that are close to the minimum amount the US government typically cares about ($10,000), then the government could care less about your BTC even if you ARE using them to buy drugs, simply because it isn&#039;t cost effective for that particular agency to go after you. Your local police department on the other hand has a budget just for that, and I&#039;ll bet money the two agencies can communicate if they wish.<br /><br />Essentially I&#039;m warning you all to stay cautious. This post is not in response to a large bust, a new banking regulating regarding digital currency, or any other new policy. This post is in response to me finally not being employed for long enough to feel safe posting this.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what you CAN do at the bank to increase your anonymity: AKA (( TL;DR ))<br /><br />- Leave most of the deposit slip blank and let the Teller fill it out. This limits how much you&#039;re touching the actual slip (and puts the Teller&#039;s fingerprints on it) and increases the amount of plausible deniability you will have in court that you knew the money was going to illegal activities<br /><br />- Wear a hat and clothes into the bank that you don&#039;t normally wear, do ANYTHING that isn&#039;t TOO obvious and could actually be cause for further scrutiny that alters your appearance. Common sense here. No fake beards unless you can pull it off. Don&#039;t get yourself into more trouble doing this. Sometimes I feel like it&#039;s better to blend in with a large crowd then to have a great disguise that you can pick out of any crowd…<br /><br />- NEVER deposit more than $2,500 in one time, and ONLY deposit using cash. This prevents any paperwork being filled out about your transaction.<br /><br />- Use many different bank branches. Don&#039;t let the Tellers begin to recognize you or the type of transaction you do. They are trained to do so.<br /><br />- NEVER provide any form of ID at all to anyone in the bank. Don&#039;t tell them your name, or anything about you. If you are an account holder of this bank, go to a branch you never use where they won&#039;t recognize you as a customer. If they ID you as one of their customers or account holders, your transaction will be saved under your name. You don&#039;t want that.<br /><br />Now, I have a PLETHORA of other info, so ask away friends, lets let this thread be as helpful as the Janetreno post office intern thread. :)

Banks and the US government are well aware of the anonymous benefits of BTC. They don&#039;t like it. They are also aware that one of the many (but very popular) uses for BTC is drug smuggling. SR isn&#039;t the only one. <br /><br />They have INTEREST in these accounts and transactions, but they don&#039;t FLAG them all. The flagging comes as a result of IDing the individual, the amount of money involved in the transaction, or if the accounts involved are already flagged.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163174.msg1159120#msg1159120">Quote from: lsdizzle on May 23, 2013, 11:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*originating from or going to<br /><br />PS Would direct deposits from mtgox to my personal bank account be scrutinized?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, especially if the amounts are large or the transactions are regular or both. What it would take to receive the first stage of scrutiny or &quot;flagging&quot;, I&#039;m not sure...probably a conviction or criminal record, or if you are already under investigation. Frequent abnormal account behavior can also be grounds to flag the account. The account holder may have NO IDEA that their account is flagged, and in most cases the bank won&#039;t tell you if the account is &quot;flagged&quot;

Think rich compared to college students. Enough money to do whatever they want today, but not enough to save hundreds of thousands in offshore bank accounts. BTC simply cannot be cashed out like that. <br /><br />Cashing out BTC is difficult, whatever DPR is doing he&#039;s doing it slow and correctly or I imagine they would have nabbed him (them) by now.

				Sorry that was a little off topic, thank you to the original poster of this thread for the info, very informative.&nbsp; So are you suggesting htat one way to tell if your account is flagged is by the teller?&nbsp; For example if the transactions takes longer than usual or if you notice a pattern of manager or other teller looking at what the teller you went to is doing each time?

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				Do you guys use your real info for moneygrams?&nbsp; I&#039;ve done them twice and used my real info but laundered the bitcoins.&nbsp; The other option I&#039;ve used is also through bitinstant.&nbsp; When they used to allow you to go to banks and pay and invoice that worked well.

				ok 2 more questions.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; If they flag one of your accounts, is it safe to asume they have flagged all your accounts?&nbsp; For example. If I am on 3 accounts.&nbsp; 1 account soley in my name.&nbsp; 1 business account assigned to the business tax id # that I am on as a signer.&nbsp; And 1 joint account that I am on as secondary.&nbsp; If they flag one of them, are they all flaged?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Say I have an account at wells fargo that is flaged.&nbsp; Does that mean my account at Bank of america and chase bank are too?&nbsp; Do they have that level of interbank communication?<br /><br />Thanks

I&#039;d also stay below $2,500 deposited per month, depending on your method of deposit. (multiple anonymous method would allow you to deposit a higher dollar amount per month spread out among the different types of deposit).<br /><br />And yes, many legit people are buying BTC. Many more illegitimate buyer and users than legitimate, tho. The key is to blend in with the legit ones.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163174.msg1164825#msg1164825">Quote from: arananegro on May 27, 2013, 04:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and in your professional opinion what is then the safest way to structure deposits to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp; Say you want to deposit 20k a month.&nbsp; Keep it under 2500 a transaction? and split between 3 different banks?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As someone else also responded, if you&#039;re bringing in 20k a month, work for like 6 months, and cash out very slowly over a long period of time as anonymously as possible. Ask other vendors of similar size to you how they operate and go from there. <br /><br />IMO...It is not feasable or realistic to think this kind of income can be had for very long without someone who you don&#039;t want to look at you looking at you. As I said above: if you&#039;re bringing in 20k a month, work for like 6 months, and cash out very slowly over a long period of time as anonymously as possible.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163174.msg1164823#msg1164823">Quote from: excellenttoast on May 27, 2013, 04:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why are you using your accounts for Bitcoin purposes?&nbsp; Do you have some service connected to your account like Dwolla?&nbsp; I feel moneygrams and similar things are much safer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Always good advice. If you feel it is more typical to do Moneygram transactions, then do so. If you have a secure way to use bank deposits, then do that.

This depends on the bank. Typically these &quot;flags&quot; are applied to any account in your name, regardless of the bank after the feds have decided to place them on you after being referred to your behavior by the bank. However, a Teller can only typically see your accounts with that specific bank, so keep your weird transactions either blended in or by themselves.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163174.msg1164804#msg1164804">Quote from: excellenttoast on May 27, 2013, 04:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, it was probably pretty stupid for me to use my real info but I was afraid they would have some way of verifying my address and be more suspicious if things didn&#039;t line up.&nbsp; I should just go to some place when it&#039;s really busy so the employee doesn&#039;t have time to dick around and scrutinize.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Never a bad idea. Think of wherever it is you are conducting any transaction kind of how we on the Road view the USPS.

				Great info contained in this thread. Moonlies, did you ever witness any explicit coordination with LE? Such as the bank handing over customer info to LE, or helping LE set up some sort of sting operation?

One involved a robbery (self explanatory), in the other, a local Sheriff came in and conversed with my manager privately and they exchanged papers which made me make the assumption that the bank had accused someone of fraud or some other crime, and the Sheriff was here to either tell us who they were or for us to tell them who they were.
