				it &quot;could be&quot; depending on the locations of the orders, but rest assured if you have other incoming mail it will blend in<br /><br />but if you have multiple orders coming express, not good

				Too who sellers or the company delivering??<br /><br />Do you normally get packages?? ebay amazon etc???<br /><br /><br />Side-Note: My friend used to have product FedEx&#039;d to his house years ago and got busted when the delivery guy delivered the package to the wrong address and fedex opened it to make sure that before they sent it to the right place it hadnt been tampered with

				lol wait.. they tampered it to check that it hadn&#039;t been tampered with? anyway, i usually get packages from amazon only in spurts and they are bigger packages that are delivered by the truck. this time around, it will be 3 very small packages coming from all over. you think it&#039;s safe to not worry?
