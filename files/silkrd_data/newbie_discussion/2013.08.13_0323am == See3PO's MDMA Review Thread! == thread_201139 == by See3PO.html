				I have been in contact with a few buyers who will be sampling the first of the MDMA I am offering. All I have asked is to post the reviews here. Further reviews will be posted here as well, at least until I get out of the newb section. If I have spoken with you about a sample, please PM me on here (the forum, not SR). I will send you a link to a custom listing for the sample. In the next couple days I will be doing samples of 2C-B and 2C-E also.

				I&#039;m in the process of getting the samples together and making the listing right now. Be honest people! I would love feedback on any/all factors: product quality, stealth, shipping time, etc. I will be sending out four 250 mg samples of MDMA. It will be a stealth listing just for these four people. More samples will probably be given out later for new batches, as well as the 2C-B/2C-E I mentioned!

				Asianboy, have you had a change to try it out yet? I saw that you finalized so I hope you already got it. Either way, I got one more MDMA sample to send out. Who&#039;s interested!???<br />

				&nbsp;Just received my MDMA sample yesterday (8/17).&nbsp; The product looks beautiful. The crystals weren&#039;t really broken down much, a little bit for shipping but overall the crystals are still intact. It only took two days to arrive at my drop.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I licked my finger and dipped it in the bag and got that extremely bitter taste :)&nbsp; I even took a reagent test with a bit of the stuff and it quickly went from a dark purple to black! :) :) so that&#039;s another good indicator.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I haven&#039;t actually ate any of the crystals yet so this is only one part of my review.&nbsp; Though since I have a bit of the stuff I was thinking of eyeballing maybe 75mg or so and eat that today to get a feel for your Bomb looking MDMA! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I went through my stash today and flushed all of my NBOMe&#039;s! Fuck those things!&nbsp; All I got now is MDMA and some green. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I got around to trying your mdma last night.&nbsp; I eyeballed my dose and parachuted it.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing I took at least a point because I was rolling very nicely, but not that hard.&nbsp; Overall I had a good time with your mdma and I can vouch for your stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s very clean and pure and feels very chill, and euphoric.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I can&#039;t wait to try some more of this but up my dosage. I&#039;m no stranger to Ecstasy and MDMA, it&#039;s just been a while since I&#039;ve last rolled.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall you have great mdma!! and you&#039;re already proving yourself to be a very standup vendor!&nbsp; I hope to do more business with you soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />WOW was I feeling fucking great!!!!!&nbsp;

				This is some great MDMA. High purity, definitely above &gt;80%. This isn&#039;t like the local garbage you find in town. This is like the shit you find from the UK and the Netherlands.<br /><br />Fast shipping and friendly seller.

				no see3p0, that was me. I did a very small amount with my girl and we were feeling great. Boy i was fucked. We had the best sex EVER. Even though i do not know you, i want to thank you for an awesome life changing night, and you provided the fun for us.<br /><br />If anyone is considering ordering from see3po, go for it. Very good vendor, no problems. Came in big clear crystals and crushes up into small shiny powder.
