				Taking a peek into your soul as you say.<br /><br />One other reason is that is really a safe to use substance. Plus, and I find this one of the best aspects of it, the whole process is less that half an hour. So why not?<br /><br />After I realized what DMT is about, this is the substance I would advise everyone in my surrounding to try. Not mushrooms, not mdma, not lsd, not even cannabis. :) It is the best substance, safest, stronger and has the quickest tolerance/comedown of all.<br /><br />A magnificent product :)<br /><br />Adamiz

				DMT scares me for some reason. I want to try it, I really do. Ive read a ton about it, Ive watched documentaries.... I dont know. I just cant bring myself to do it.<br /><br />How do you get over the fear? Once it has you? Is DMT one of those drugs that needs &quot;Set and Setting&quot;? I dont want to be scared out of my wits for half an hour just because I was a little nervous beforehand.

				I was really anxious when I did both acid and dmt but once I started to notice the effects I just had no choice than to be both ecstatic and amazed. Admittedly I didn&#039;t break through on dmt but it was enlightening nonetheless.<br /><br />On both occasions I was doing it with friends though which helped a lot with the anxiety and is something I would thoroughly recommend if you can, especially for a first time.<br /><br />I think setting is quite important but your (mind)set is crucial. Anxiety should be fine but if you&#039;re going into it outright scared then it&#039;s probably not going to end well, similarly if you&#039;re angry. If you can maintain an open mindset, like that of a child exploring a castle or some other terrible similie, then you&#039;re much more likely to enjoy the experience.<br /><br />Having said all that most of my personal experience is with acid. I have only taken dmt one time but I plan on doing it again pretty soon. I&#039;ve got that burning plastic taste in my mouth just from thinking about it haha.

				Everyone as you used<br />SHOULD NOT <br />use dmt<br />I believe a person who&#039;s currently contemplating their life here on earth under a certain impression from a dmt trip not be afraid of committing the act, if not, used as assurance for his/her choice<br />

				As much as I adore blowing the top off my consciousness exposing the face of dog, DMT does taste like ass. Gnarly, dirty dead hippie ass. I have yet to be able to tolerate the harshness of the smoke, to breakthrough. MDMA + Gel tabs of LSD = candy flipping of a of a most amazing nature. If I were able to ingest DMT in a fashion that didn&#039;t make me regret being born with taste buds, I am all for it.

				Not everybody should try DMT. People with high blood pressure should absolutely avoid it, and it&#039;s a really intense experience that some people just can&#039;t handle.

				I watched the DMT documentary.&nbsp; Having always been a big fan of lsd, mushrooms etc for the pure trip aspect. I always felt revived mentally afterward and i hear DMT is the best for soul searching etc. I am definitely trying it&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/Smileys/default/cheesy.gifAny advice for a newbie on dosage??
