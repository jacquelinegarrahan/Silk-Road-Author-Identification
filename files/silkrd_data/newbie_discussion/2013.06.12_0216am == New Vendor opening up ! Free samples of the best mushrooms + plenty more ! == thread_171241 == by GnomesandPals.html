				Hey there everyone ! I&#039;m becoming a new vendor on Monday 17th of this month (less than a weeks time) so I thought I might as well start up a thread on here to see who would be keen on my wares !<br /><br />First and foremost as soon as the store goes up Monday morning I&#039;ll be offering a free dried gram of Psilocybe Subaeruginosa to the first ten people to order to help me build up a reputation with you all as a trustworthy and speedy seller, it will be limited to one gram per customer but it&#039;s free and you can&#039;t really beat that.<br /><br />All of my shrooms are 100% Psilocybe Subaeruginosa picked wild in Australia and they&#039;re pretty strong compared to your average home-grown Cubensis varieties, I personally think twice as strong per dried weight and the quantity available to me is insane so bulk buying will most definitely be an option with listings for up to 28g at an unbeatable price for the quality, fast shipment and stealth I&#039;ll be displaying. All orders will be shipped in military grade heat seal foil which will be packed in a safe environment and washed down with alcohol to ensure absolutely no smell can escape from the product. I&#039;m also offering all orders placed before 3pm eastern time will be shipped express that day for next day delivery to make sure you get your product in time for whatever occasion it&#039;s planned for on all domestic orders&nbsp; :)<br /><br />These are my products and prices, please let me know if you think they&#039;re unreasonable at all or if you are interested in a larger order.<br /><br />1g dried sub powder - $25 USD<br />3.5g dried sub powder - $80.50 USD or $23/g<br />7g dried sub powder - $150.50 USD or $21.50/g<br />14g dried sub powder - $280 USD or $20/g<br />28g dried sub powder - $504 USD or $18/g<br />1 sub spore print - $25 USD<br />5 sub spore prints - $100 USD<br />1 cubensis spore print - $35 USD<br />5 cubensis spore prints - $150 USD<br />(I have multiple varieties of cubensis prints from all around the world so it will be on a lucky dip basis as to what variety you get)<br /><br />COMING SOON:<br />Gnomes and Pals ol&#039; timey sub bacardi 151 tincture - a bottle of bacardi 151 with 1g dried weight per 30ml shot - $550 USD/700ml bottle<br />Gnomes and Pals ol&#039; timey sub honey - 1g dried per tea spoon - great on a toasted bagel on a seedy sunday morning ;) yet to be priced but we&#039;ll be doing 100gm, 250gm and 1kg tubs.<br /><br /><br />My shipping policy is as follows: International is available and stealth will be upped with the product double wrapped and concealed within another product but I will require FE on international orders with no refund policy put in place as of yet, pretty much as soon as it&#039;s left me and I&#039;ve made sure of the quality of stealth used then you&#039;re on your own but i suspect a high percentage of success as it&#039;s coming out of Australia and not being delivered to Australia. All domestic refunds are on a case to case basis but I suspect 50% refund would be possible to those with a trustworthy buying history.<br /><br />On an ending note prices are for the sub powder in a baggie and then stealth wrapped, you are able to purchase the smaller quantities done up into gelatin capsules but it will be slightly more expensive to cover the cost of the capsules.<br /><br />Thankyou immensely and I can&#039;t wait to do business with all of you ! And remember to be ready monday morning for a chance at getting one of those ten free samples !<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Gnomes and Pals.

				As for buying the product, forgive the double post, interested, but it will have to wait as mushrooms have not been experienced at all yet, so starting with strong product may not be best idea.

				About this time on Monday, so 5 days or 120 hours from this moment :)<br />I think you&#039;ll do fine on the subs for a first time just start at three quarters of a dried gram for a medium strength high for a first timer :)

				They wouldn&#039;t happen to have come from a forest south of a southern state capital would they? Somewhere with a Mediterranean climate? (don&#039;t answer that but I can live in hope) I have some very fond memories of going picking there and thoroughly enjoying those little critters.&nbsp; Good visuals a chatty kind of trip from what I remember (it&#039;s been a long while).&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck with the new store, if you fancy a review from abroad count me in.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;ll certainly put an order in the next time I want some mushrooms.
