				A lot of the domestic Australian products I understand the large price hikes, but there are just some that don&#039;t make sense to me.<br /><br />Taking a look at the numbers:<br /><br />1g hash:<br />International: 0.08BTC<br />Domestic: 0.29BTC<br /><br />1g P. cubensis:<br />International: 0.06BTC <br />Domestic: 0.16BTC (if they&#039;re even listed, atm they&#039;re not)<br /><br />1g of weed (looking at the low-end of):<br />International: 0.12 <br />Domestic: 0.20BTC<br /><br />That&#039;s not even including shipping which most of the international listings have for free compared to domestic&#039;s 0.07BTC. With postage that&#039;s like $30 more per gram of hash.<br /><br />Marijuana and by that right hash are very easily procured in Australia, decriminalized in most states - the threat of LE is fairly low. I don&#039;t see why Australians are shelling out so much extra for their THC.<br /><br />If any vendors out there can offer these products domestically at a price that competes with the international vendors I&#039;m sure you will get a lot of business. <br /><br />I&#039;m considering going international for hash, weed or shrooms. But I&#039;m really worried about the risk; especially in Australia, our customs ain&#039;t nuthin&#039; to fuck with.

				I would also be keen to see some international suppliers of Cuban Cohiba cigars. They&#039;re like $5 each in Latin America and ~$50 in Australia because of taxes. Pity I can&#039;t post in the product requests forum.

Small amounts of powders should arrive just fine from overseas. But research vendors first. If you would like me to recommend any good overseas vendors, PM me and I will PM you some good vendors.

				Agree with Dingo. Prices in Oz are ridiculous but I guess you&#039;ve got to weigh up the risk of seizure of o/s orders versus guaranteed delivery with domestic

Your order WILL arrive.<br />Importing pills and capsules isn&#039;t as successful as importing powder, due to the way they have to be packaged. <br /><br />You can always try your luck overseas, and if that fails then try domestic. I&#039;ve never ordered mushrooms from overseas, so I really don&#039;t know what the success rate is like.<br />If an order gets seized by customs, nothing will happen unless you are ordering large quantities. But small orders which are seized are generally not looked into. You won&#039;t get a letter. It just won&#039;t arrive. However if any mail gets seized it would still be wise not to keep ordering from overseas to the same address because if they found a string of packages which were seized all going to the same address, it may get looked into.
