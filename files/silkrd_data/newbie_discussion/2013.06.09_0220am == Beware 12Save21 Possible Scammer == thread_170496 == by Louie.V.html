				Unable to make an official thread anywhere else so I thought I would at least do it here. <br /><br />12Save21 is collecting many orders that people are FE for. <br />You can review his feedback and you ll spot people that say they still havent received anything. <br />The seller says there are issues and apologies for the delay but I do not believe it. What seller would continue to take orders WHEN HE IS BACKED UP as he says, when he hasnt solved his supposed issue??&nbsp; Its been WAY past acceptable delivery time including with his &quot;First Class&quot; mail. <br />I can also see some feedback on the account that looks way to weird......&nbsp; &nbsp;Possible fake feedback here guys. This guy doesnt even have his own forum page. <br /><br />ANYWAYS&nbsp; just beware people. DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY ANYMORE FOR THIS VENDOR. STICK TO THE ESCROW SYSTEM ! PROTECT YOURSELVES!<br />link to his page<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/30abe815bc

				Could someone please make an official thread in the vendor review thread? I know others have been scammed by this vendor.<br />NO communication whatsoever from this person, However they are very quick to message back once youve placed an order.<br />Many people are finalizing SO please spread the word. I hate to see other members scammed out of their hard earned money.<br /><br />Its been 1 week and a half since the supposed shipment date. This is &quot;first class&quot; mail btw... <br />MODS&nbsp; you can tell that this dude has fake feedback! Please look into this guy

				I&#039;d like to add to this thread.<br /><br />I too have purchased from 12Save21 and unfortunately FE to get a break on shipping. It&#039;s been a little over a week now, and there has been no correspondence outside of the original &quot;Thank you for ordering&quot;. I suspect that any of the successful orders that were made have been fake feedback, mainly for the fake based on when they put their feedback it would be impossible for them to receive their shipment before mine.

				Yeah he is not reading my messages either. <br /><br />Ordered 1.5 months ago, and wrote to him after a month (14 days ago and havent been read yet.)<br /><br />Then i saw that his profile stated that he had problems so i wrote again (with the proper subject title), but that have not been read either. His profile stated that he would pull down his listings so he would have time to catch up, but as far as i can tell that havent happened, and most of the original statement are now deleted. I am going to give this a day or 2 more before i message him again, and then change my feedback. I suggest that everybody change their feedback soon so his rating will start dropping! Perhaps that will get his attention (Or at least scare new buyers off until he has caught up, or gone full out scammer!)<br /><br />I really hope that he is not scamming, but i am beginning to feel anxious (And that is a feeling that i dislike very much!)

				the user guide and others say dont ever deal with a vendor<br />that asks you to FE. That is your only insurance.<br />I have read other posts that people say that if you finalize early<br />there is nothing that can be done if you dont get anything..<br />This info is important thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />There are sellers too that are new so if there require<br />that a newbie FE&nbsp; and it is not in the description as it should then go elsewhere. If they hit you with it<br />after the transaction is made that is unethical and should&nbsp; cancel order if possible.<br />From my experience with bitcoin so far I have learned that the buyer must beware.<br />

				Guess I need to take my place among the dummies who FE with this guy in order to save a few bucks on shipping.<br />10 days here. No pills, zero response from vendor. <br />I know, I know; &quot;NEVER FE&quot;<br />Guess since I don&#039;t get my hard on pills I&#039;ll use the free time to practice my &quot;Never FE&quot; mantra, while I&#039;m changing that POS&#039;s feedback from the undeserved 5&#039;s I gave him... :(<br /><br />BTW: I&#039;ve ordered ED drugs from Angelina in the past (without FE&#039;ing) and she delivered lightning fast and the price was the same (maybe a few cents higher) as 12Save21.<br />She was out when I ordered from him, but I see she now has her listings back up!

				I submitted a support ticket about 12Save21 and this is what I got in response.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Unfortunately, once the order is finalized the payment is released to the vendor and is no longer in escrow, the system which enables SR staff to aid in dispute resolution. If you can not secure a refund, my best advice is to keep this in mind when making future orders and post accurate feedback, including on the forum (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=7.0), so that other users may make informed decisions.<br /><br />Please see the FAQ section of the SR Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I.27ve_already_finalized_my_order.2C_but_am_having_problems.<br /><br />I have looked into the issue and there is no evidence that the vendor is padding their feedback. If Silk Road recommends that buyers do not FE, and then buyers go and do it anyway, there is nothing that we can do if the item does not arrive - that&#039;s what escrow is for, to protect against such issues.<br /><br />Once a vendor has completed 35 successful transactions and has been a seller for at least one month, they may ask their customers to finalize early without repercussion. In no way do we support finalizing early in general and this rule should not be construed as support for finalizing early for more established vendors.<br /><br />As there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on the vendor&#039;s part in this instance, I can take no action against them.<br /><br />~SR Support</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Obviously SR Support knows their shit, so I really hope that this is just a scenario where a few of us really did just have bad luck, and it&#039;s just bad timing on the vendor himself. I like to stay optimistic, because nobody likes to be out any amount of money.

				my first order, about 2 months ago was fine with this vendor....no issues. but now, im not getting any response either after 2 weeks of attempts. I checked my sent items and they&#039;re still marked as &quot;unread&quot;... all whilst i see his status &quot;last seen: today&quot;, everyday. what a bummer.
