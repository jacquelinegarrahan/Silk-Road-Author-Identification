				Hello all <br /><br />I am eager to get sorted out and make my first purchases. I am trying to avoid having anything shipped to my home, but I wonder if shipping to my PO box would be more risky. Why, or why not? What say you?

				PO Box? Not.<br /><br />Do you plan on paying cash (bit weird) for a PO box that will only receive occasional packages that you anxiously check for?&nbsp; Or if you use real bank details to pay for the PO box, that&#039;s a trail back to you too. Might as well use your actual address, and so as not to alarm the post man, your actual name, maybe slightly misspelled. Also if you get caught with a PO box there&#039;s no denying it through &quot;I don&#039;t know why I was sent this!&quot;<br /><br />Anonymity is more important on the financial transactions with currency to bitcoin to SR.

				If you regularly receive mail at the PO Box, then you should be fine. I had a few different orders come in when I used to have one, never any problems.

				If you get caught using a PO box then I&#039;d think you&#039;d be fucked.&nbsp; In the US at least GPS tracking is common and I&#039;ve read they&#039;ll even employ an agent that marks you when you open the box.&nbsp; That&#039;s a problem wherever you get the package delivered.<br /><br />A PO box can work (especially for domestic shipped right) but it depends on how you use it.

				Yeah I was thinking about a P.O box too, but then the risk is too much once they&#039;ve actually caught you red handed.<br /><br />Only way I guess is to actually give them your address and if it gets caught just say eh fuck you I dont know why I have it.

				I&#039;ve always used my home address and most people who have ordered from me have as well. I have gotten a few orders from PO Boxes though and shipped there as requested. I think it is just a matter of how frequently you use it as mentioned above. As well as the lack of plausible deniability.
