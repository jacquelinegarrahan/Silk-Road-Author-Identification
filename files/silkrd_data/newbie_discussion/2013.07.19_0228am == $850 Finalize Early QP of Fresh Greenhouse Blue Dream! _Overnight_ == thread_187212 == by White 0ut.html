I checked around the whole package and no rips, tears or damage and certainly nothing out of the ordinary, I didn&#039;t really blind an eye to it. Opened it up to find a professional-standard MBB packing, no dogs is ever going to smell through that and I am pretty sure this would even make it international no problems.<br /><br />A lovely deep dank bud, definitely a very well looked after plant. Got a little too excited with it&#039;s arrival and took a bit for sampling before weighing which was heavenly, I could have gone through the whole QP today if I didn&#039;t have to go out. Even with that little bit taken out that, I was happy to see my scales weigh in at 122g, at least 10g overweight! Overall a very professional vendor, the goodies are real eye candy and they don&#039;t disappoint at all!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Guy above me is totally right though, FE is nearly a scam every time. The thing that makes FE worth it however, is when someone like me comes thru &amp; proves the &quot;FE scam&quot; wrong.

				Don&#039;t FE unless you can afford to lose the BTC&#039;s. It&#039;s that simple. <br /><br />It&#039;s too bad &quot;finalize early&quot; is named the way it is. It&#039;s hard to grasp as a newbie. What it reallly amounts to is &quot;payment before delivery.&quot;&nbsp; That means you absolutely have to trust the vendor is truly going to deliver the goods.<br /><br />Would you buy an ounce from your street dealer, by putting the cash in his mailbox, and trusting him to deliver to your door later in the day? Maybe you would, because you see that guy day in and day out. But an SR vendor is invisible, untouchable not just by the law but by his buyers. That&#039;s a critical difference. Hence the mantra:<br /><br />DO NOT FE<br />DO NOT FE<br />DO NOT FE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, unless you love to gamble.<br /><br />For any newbies who haven&#039;t heard about it yet, the most infamous scammer on the Road was Tony76. Search and see how an uber-trusted, well-established vendor ran a &quot;special&quot;, which required FE. He gathered a *lot* of money, then ... disappeared!<br /><br />Well, we&#039;ve no idea if he disappeared. The nature of this beast is that it&#039;s trivial for a vendor to reincarnate as Tony77.&nbsp; :)

				We post and post to people not to FE and if they do and get ripped its their own fault. There are several threads about it and about people getting ripped off. Then along comes a hero member asking you to do just the opposite of everything that everyone in these forums preaches daily. Im not saying hes a bad guy, Im not saying hes gonna rip you off or anything like that. He could very well be an excellent honest vendor but to post in the newbie forum where people are trying to learn how to act on SR and be safe I think is a bit counter productive. They have one good experience with you and get ripped by the next guy. I dunno... I hope your legit and everyone gets what they pay for. <br /><br />Good luck to you and be smart everyone. Thats a lot of money to hand over. I was ripped off by a vendor who had 100% positive feedback for 300+ transactions. The FE scammer can look like anyone. The money you FE he uses to open a new vendor account. Just sayin.
