				Yes, used to enjoy it quite a bit, found it to be quite a stress reliever and just enjoyable, especially with friends. An oz would last 3 of us maybe three weekends. What I liked, at least with good stuff, was that is a natural plant product. It&#039;s not made in some chemistry lab or anything like that. Granted though some of the chemicals that can be used in growing it are not ideal but what with SR you have your choice of many strains and growing styles!<br /><br />Jimson Weed? I read about that stuff, I don&#039;t know how friendly that stuff would be?
