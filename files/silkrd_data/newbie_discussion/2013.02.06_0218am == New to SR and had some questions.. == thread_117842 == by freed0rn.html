				New to SR and obviously the forum as this is my first post. I want to first thank everyone involved in making this system a reality because it is exactly what I had been wanting to find for a long time. My questions are regarding ordering and processing times, and I know that this can vary by vendor so I am just basically looking for a general consensus. I placed two orders about 24 hours ago from two different vendors (mid grade green, and high grade green) and so far they have sat in processing ever since. About how long on average does it take for well reviewed vendors to generally ship? Does the processing change to a different status once they have? Since I am new will this make cause for extended time frames? Is there anything that is generally done on behalf of a newbie like myself to make a vendor more at ease with me being new or is new customers just part of the process and they understand they have to come from somewhere? Thanks for any and all help, like I said I am definitely thankful for this marketplace and will be even more excited once I receive my first shipments!

				Bump - just looking for anyone who has had positive transactions on how long the processing to shipping took and if the status changed? Thanks

				I placed 3 orders Sunday night.<br /><br />2 of them have been processed and shipped (it goes from processing to in transit)<br /><br />The third is still processing, and that is coming from the highest rated vendor of the three (they&#039;re in the top 1% over all too)<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				Hey thanks for the response Oatmeal, that really makes me feel more at ease. I noticed one of the vendors seems to have had a issue and they might be taking longer to ship, but hopefully I will receive one of the two orders by late this week as I chose priority. Things locally suck so I have really been at a loss for months and am really looking forward to a stable connection. Hope your shipments arrive safe n sound :)

				I have about 6 orders so far.&nbsp; Some vendors respond to messages, some dont.&nbsp; Some expect u to order without asking any questions at all, if u ask too many questions they get annoyed and dont want to sell to you.<br />Always choose sellers with good rep.&nbsp; They will usually get you the package in 7-10 days.&nbsp; Most orders come within a week, but dont always expect that.&nbsp; Order early.&nbsp; &amp; order from more than 1 guy if u really need the product.<br />Jahbud is an excellent seller,but there was a week delay my second order.&nbsp; So anything can happen.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; And you have to be extra nice with these sellers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some get offended real easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay away from Cimicon&nbsp; and&nbsp; South Star.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />

				As you may have heard there are changes at the Post office, these cchanges are making it hard for vendors to purchase tracking for their items to ensure they dont get ripped off. they actually have to go inside and purchase the tracking. vendors with lots of orders who still want tracking for their items have to make drops at other post offices because it would look funny if some guy in a hat and shades was dropping off 10=15 packages a day when tracking can be purchased online.the problem w going inside is that if LE orders from them then it would be possible for them to go and check the cctv at the post office where the item was sent from and possibly start investigating the vendor.

				Thanks for the responses. I was hoping since I ordered Monday night to receive something towards the end of this week but now I am doubting that. Thanks for giving me a heads up on some of the vendors Loops, I will definitely keep that in mind. I have dealt with the post a lot during different occupations and phases in my life chaos, so I know it can be extremely hectic and just plain ol shitty sometimes when you have a large group of packages, all needing tracking, especially if some are international. I am just hoping all goes well so I can get some other orders going, just wanting to receive before putting out more for something else. Thanks again for the responses.
