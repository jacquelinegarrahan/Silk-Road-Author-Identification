				Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster.<br /><br />I&#039;m a very occasional buyer from SR, in fact, so occasional that the last time I bought BTC, it was still at about 17AUD, and the last 1.5BTC which I thought was small change when I made my last purchases meant I could buy some MXE again (thank you exchange rates!). I hooked up my favorite vendor and purchased 2 grams (I&#039;d bought up to 10g once), he&#039;d sent it on the 6th from the UK and it still hasn&#039;t arrived in AU here, over 2 weeks later.<br />&nbsp;I never got a letter declaring a seizing of my package.<br />I&#039;m quite disappointed it hasn&#039;t arrived but right now I&#039;m more concerned about whether it would be safe to purchase from Silk Road again (now, or possibly in the future), which is pretty much the only safe way to purchase MXE (as far as I know) in Australia.<br />The question is, would you risk it? I have been considering contacting another vendor asking for extra precautions, and more clever disguises (for example, sending the MXE in something which looks normal, like a toy or gadget which, will need to be broken open to retrieve it), for an extra cost of course.<br />

				I&#039;m fairly new, but you probably should not order to your address again. Contact the vendor and make sure he sent it and to the right address and everything. Hoping everything goes well!

				If you have had a package intercepted at your old address then they&#039;ll also be watching you at your new once they know you&#039;re there. your old addie is farked now. oz customs dont send love letters like US do.<br />Everything was goin ok 4 us til i orderd from oseas then nothing ever arrived again even from interstate. they flaggd us.<br />Oz customs have a massive hard on for SR right now which is why uv seen enterthematrix who waz just a big ass resella fuck off with everiones BTC AND NOW drugformulas iz tryinmg to trick SR INTO RELEASING TO THEM THE FUNDDS TRAPPED IN ESCROW that they claim there customas are tryna scam from THEM!!!!! THAtS A CLASSIC&nbsp; scam by a venda.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sorry not&nbsp; shoutin just dint realize upper was on.<br />check the mail at your knew addie and use the name of someone who useda live there. mixing up names is just creating suspisions espesh if your gonna gets ballsy n go for oseas vendas. Good luck.
