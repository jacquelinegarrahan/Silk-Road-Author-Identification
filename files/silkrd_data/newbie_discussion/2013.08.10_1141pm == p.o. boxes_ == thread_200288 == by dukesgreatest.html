				Are p.o. boxes good to use? I can&#039;t get drugs shipped to my house although if it was my own house I would. So can I do p.o. boxes or are there any alternatives?

				Sure they are, but then it can get a bit more diffucult to explain if you get caught. You will be forced to pick it up in person/pay for it. Try to get a place that accepts cash, doesnt have video cams on the boxes and is fairly crowded. Also, try to get other mail there so that LE can&#039;t clearly see it and say &quot;yeah, this is a drug dropbox&quot;<br /><br />Sorry if that didnt make enough sense, I&#039;m pretty buzzed

Plausible deniability is different in this case. I&#039;m just trying figure out if its harder for the shippers or if it causes packages to get lost.

				If it is a legit Post Box, then that should be no problem. Assuming you write the address correctly, it should be no different delivery than in any other mailbox. (btw, if you&#039;re anxious some is watching a PO box, you can just let it sit for a really long while, you can&#039;t do this with your own mailbox) <br /><br />Also, if they find drugs in your regular mailbox might give them a reason to get a warrant to search your house and there they might find something incriminating. I don&#039;t think it would work like that for a PO box.<br /><br />(if you can, set up a PO box in someone elses name. Or maybe a fake company)

				You would have to use the info that is on the PO box. Idk how lenient they are on PO boxes where you live, whether you have a fake ID or a friend you can convince to set it up for you

				Im not completely familiar with PO boxes. But my 2 cents would be using your own name instead of a fake or company name. In case the PO box was to be watched, it&#039;d be much easier to deny a package being sent to the wrong box then you having a key to someone elses box on &quot;accident&quot;.. Just my thoughts.

				Not sure where you live but in my country you need valid ID to open a Post Office box. The major advantage with a post office box would be to avoid family/housemates accessing your mail. Also, PO boxes are weatherproof, would hate to order tabs and have them soaked in you letterbox on a rainy day.

				You can also order Poste Restante (&quot;General Delivery&quot; in the US).. You&#039;d have to pick it up at the post office and you don&#039;t need to pay anything for that.
