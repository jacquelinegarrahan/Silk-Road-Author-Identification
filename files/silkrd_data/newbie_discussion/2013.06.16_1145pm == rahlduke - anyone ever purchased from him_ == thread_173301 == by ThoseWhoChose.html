				I noticed this lsd listening that was quite cheap, so i decided to purchase without FE.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b438d3b476<br /><br />Next day I hear people claiming he&#039;s a scammer. Has anyone purchased from him before and can vouch? thanks.

				I recently saw his offered and couldn&#039;t pass it up so I bout about 35 hits and they all arrived pretty quickly. I haven&#039;t tested them yet though but I can vouch for his honest delivery. I&#039;m wonder how good these hits are as well and even if it&#039;s LSD

				RD used to not use PGP and only had a few listings up and very few transactions in his time on SR so that is what made users nervous about him that he could be LE...<br />Pretty hard to be a successful scammer when you dont require FE and abide by SR rules etc.<br /><br />But LE does what it takes to catch people.<br /><br />Since RD&#039;s announcement of his LSD sale and all these threads about him on the forums he has changed his vendor profile and agreed to use PGP.<br />Still recommend waiting until more feedback comes in.<br /><br />So far everything seems to be on the up &amp; up. Good prices can scare people unfortunately. <br />

				I am very eager to hear about this vendor; I hope he is good.&nbsp; I like his name, but I also really like that if I remember correctly his page says he is USA based and his prices and quality are supposed to be good.&nbsp; LSD is very rare in the real world, especially where I live and I would love another LSD trip; it has been too long.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to get some money and start trying some people out, but I prefer to be pretty much absolutely certain before I place an order due to my financial situation.

				i recently just message rahlduke and asked him for a sample so i could review it and spread the word to let people know if he is legit he replied within the hour and just asked me to send him my address and he will send me two doses which seems rather awesome in my book.&nbsp; 8)

				i purchased a 10 strip from rahlduke last week and took some over the weekend. here&#039;s a halved assed trip report -<br />my girl and i went to this festival and I took one hit (unperfed but had lines in it? wtf? who does that?) but whatever dats cool.<br />so i take one on the car ride there.<br />about an hour and a half later i think i might be feeling something, but no really. so i got kind of annoyed and took 2 more. <br />half our later the music started to turn into color slabs and started sliding into people. at this point the entire universe was liquified and i thought people were drowning so i yelled at a group of people &quot;hold on! I can help you! just hold on! don&#039;t let go!&quot;<br />and they all started laughing at me and started to morph into politicians and i turned to my girl and said &quot;lets get the fuck out of here. why would you laugh at someone trying to help you?&quot;<br />anyways, we got home and started listening to some classical. i noticed our apartment was really clean and spotless and it just felt like we had jumped out of a colossal storm of humanity, but now everything was nice a quiet. <br />basically, it just felt like i peeked for 3 hours and then it just stopped. i still felt the after effects, but it was really interesting. i&#039;m pretty damn sure it was lsd.

And what size blotters were they? <br /><br />The real question to ask is whether there was a taste to the tabs or any numbing sensation. Also did you keep it under your tongue or swallow it right away?<br /><br />Like Jack N Hoff said, that doesn&#039;t really sound much like LSD. 2 hits causing extreme visuals like that and then ending way early sounds a lot like a 25x-nbome. If it was tasteless however, then it&#039;s much more likely that it&#039;s LSD.
