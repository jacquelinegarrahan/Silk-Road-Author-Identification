				There&#039;s a vendor who&#039;s selling 59 Adderall 30mg IR tabs for $500 on BMR. I was just wondering if anyone has an opinion as to whether or not an offer like that is legit. The price seems way too good to be true. Aren&#039;t 30mg addies usually around $20 bucks a pop? If it&#039;s a scam, how could the vendor be scamming? Isn&#039;t BMR&#039;s escrow system pretty much as safe as SR&#039;s escrow? Here&#039;s a link to the listing - maybe I&#039;m just not reading it correctly?<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=view_listing&amp;id=35632<br /><br />If it&#039;s legit, I&#039;d be very interested in purchasing them, but I don&#039;t want to get screwed so I figured I would poll the masses here since our population is markedly larger than that of BMR.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />-dz

				I used to sell them on the road for $15 each, and they would fly out the door pretty much overnight every month, so I assume that $20 each is probably the usual rate.

				I&#039;d be skeptical. I&#039;ve never seen them here for cheaper than $13-15 and they average around $18-20. That sounds too good to be true. And I&#039;ve been buying them here for quite a while.

				I can assure you that it&#039;s legit. He&#039;s selling them for me. I&#039;m selling them for $500 so I can get my vendor account back on here. I&#039;ll post a link to a pic of the bottle if anyone wants.

				If he would move over to the road, I&#039;d be interested in sampling. I&#039;m not interested in migrating over to BMR and starting over as a new buyer though. Not without doing more research than my lazy ass feels like doing.

				I asked him if he would but he wouldn&#039;t budge. Not sure why. I don&#039;t want to pressure him about it anymore because he&#039;s already doing me a huge favor by having them listed for me at all. If he changes his mind, I&#039;m fucked all around. I have less than two weeks to get these sold, buy a vendor account, and get at least $400 worth of Subutex sold to make my rent on time.<br /><br />Registering at BMR is free and only takes like 1 minute tops. The only downside is that you have to wait for your bitcoins to transfer from SR to your BMR wallet (they show your deposit address in the upper right-hand side of the screen when you&#039;re logged in).
