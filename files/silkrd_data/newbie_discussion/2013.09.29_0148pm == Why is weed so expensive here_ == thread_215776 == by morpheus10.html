				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Am I the only one finding SR weed really expensive?&nbsp; Is it because of SR fees?&nbsp; Most of the weed I saw on the website is around 15-18E/g for small quantities.&nbsp; Is it really what you pay for &quot;high grade&quot;?&nbsp; Is it worth it?<br /><br />I also have another question: why do prices per gram decrease when you buy bulk?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand the logic behind this.&nbsp; Why, as a seller, would you sell 112g at 7E/g when you sell 7 grams at 15E/g?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been intrigued by this, is it some sort of marketing operation to get more customers?<br /><br />:)<br />

				You can actually find really nice weed for cheaper value here.<br />Also everything in bulk is cheaper it sells faster than selling gram by gram it&#039;s always like that when i visit street dealers.<br />Here it&#039;s like you got 100 euros and you get 16 grams of indoor. You get rid of it faster and you still set the price s you will make profit from it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				in EU, many vendors are rly too overprized. only some of them rly deliver what you pay for, pm me, i can tell you where to buy for fair price :)<br />thats because nobody buys weed at 100g 10€/g. thats not for self consume, its for dealing, and vendors know that dealers buy often the cheapest. also if they got an unlimited stock (or can rebuy) they just make with every order money. so they sell teir weed in high quantities cheaper. they dont loose their customers who order 1g/15€.<br /><br />also the sr fee is increasing this times i think :)

				i think you must be from AUS.... Only cause weed here is amazingly cheap/good. Just as good as any strain and @ $50 per 3.5grams. I&#039;ve learned through silk road this is the ONE and ONLY thing that is better to get on the street&#039;s of AUS then it is to get on SR.... But that&#039;s exactly why we pay $350 - $400 a gram of 15% - 30% cocaine. You win some you lose some, Im sure alot of user&#039;s here that buy that medical grade kush for like stupidly high prices, I bet they get charged HEAPS for SHIT on the street&#039;s. It the ONLY good thing about AUS... Im a pot head but i love coke and the fact that people can get coke on the street for like $60-120 and its good gear, pisses me right off, As im sure it pisses other&#039;s off that we can get BULLSHIT weed on the street for a nice price. Ying Yang. Sorry if none of this make&#039;s sense im off my head

				Weed is cheap as dirt on SR. Maybe your question should be: Why is weed so expensive in the EU?&nbsp; Answer, because most of it is grown in California and they sell enough domestically that anyone importing to the old country has to pay middleman prices? Just a guess.

				I dunno,&nbsp; $100/7 grams is generally retail for really good weed around here. $75 for friends, $300 for 28 grams is average price for good stuff.&nbsp; Cheaper for bulk. <br /><br />And, OT, you overseas blokes would shit if you knew the prices I paid for good, uncut blow (whitish-pinkish crystals, right off the brick) 10-12 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;It works out to about US $30 per gram and it was the best stuff I ever had.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t use the stuff anymore, probably would after a long night of drinking but no desire to look.&nbsp; But damn, it was some fire, fire shit,&nbsp; passed the melting point test just like the movie blow.

				To be honest, I find the ganj on SR to be worth every penny. If you have been to Amsterdam you will see that €15 a gram for decent high grade is a good price. Things from this site are typically bounds ahead of what you will get on the street. If you want to see for yourself just order a gram and see if you can go back to standard.<br /><br />Having said that, there are some very good offers on here if you are willing to accept homegrown (read anything less than medical grade) and if you import from an area with cheaper prices you can save a bit more money.<br /><br />Seeing as you are here though I would suggest you spring for some real weed ;)

				In my part of the world SR prices are considerably lower than most of my friends are accustomed to paying.<br />In fact, the only reason I don&#039;t get my weed through the SR is because I lucked out and hooked up with a guy who gives me a bulk discount, his prices match SR for the most part, but I can have my weed the same day.<br /><br />The reason that prices increase with bulk is because it&#039;s less work, and you can move more product with less risk.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t exactly a novel concept. It&#039;s just how retail business works.<br /><br />If you hold out for only selling small amounts at market value you have better profit margins, but you move less product by only attracting the end user. If you sell bulk cheaper then there is room for private retailers to sell your product elsewhere at a mark-up.

				You have to remember that most of your &quot;average&quot; prices are for your local citys/towns, there are many people who live in very rural places who pay way more than the silk road average for their weed. Not to mention that majority of places street weed is shit or adulterated, so your bound to get higher quality Ganj on SR than you are on the streets.....In my opinion i think its fare considering the fees, sourcing the product and all the other stuff vendors have to do. - WD

				It&#039;s more expensive because it&#039;s almost always better quality. At least for 90% of the time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never ordered weed before, but everything I&#039;ve ordered from here has been insanely higher quality than anything from the streets.<br /><br />It&#039;s like asking why Ben and Jerry&#039;s is more expensive than the grocery store, or why a Ferrari is more expensive than a BMW.<br /><br />Plus, you get the added benefit of NOT having to drive, or go on the streets.<br /><br />Is weed not legal in your country? It&#039;s legal here in the US in most states, so I&#039;ve found it pointless to order from here....

				Yea SR for weed is pretty pointless as a seller. It&#039;s good if your trying to get some variety from the run-of-the-mill weed in your area (a.k.a if you live in a place that has shitty buds). Plus you&#039;re only able to buy up to a qp which is useless for anyone who&#039;s been in the game for a respectable amount of time.
