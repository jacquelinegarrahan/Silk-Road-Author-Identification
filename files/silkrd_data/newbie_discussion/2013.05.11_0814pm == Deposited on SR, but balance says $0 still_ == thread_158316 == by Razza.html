				Hi all!&nbsp; I&#039;m a new SR member that has been doing a lot of research.&nbsp; I finally got the nerve to pickup some Bitcoins and start on the wild ride here!<br /><br />My issue... I have 4 BTC in my Blockchain.info wallet.&nbsp; I went onto the SR account page.&nbsp; Clicked the &quot;click here to make a deposit.&quot;&nbsp; Seemed simple so far. I copied the address on the following page.&nbsp; I went back to Blockhain.info wallet, pasted the SR string of letters and numbers into the &quot;Send Money,&quot; wrote in 2 BTC, and hit SEND!<br /><br />Next page showed it sent, with this confirmation:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You Sent<br /><br />2.001 BTC ($ 231.12)<br /><br />Value at time of transaction $ 232.12<br />Sent Time<br />2013-05-11 19:47:34 (+1 minutes to confirm)<br />Confirmations<br />2 Confirmations<br />Double Spend<br />No Double Spend Detected<br />Transaction Fee<br />0.001 BTC</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I figured all was done right??&nbsp; I went back to SR and my account says $0 BTC still.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Do I need to wait longer than the 15 min. that I already have for it to show?&nbsp; Please help a newb looking forward to joining everyone on this journey!&nbsp; I really hope I didn&#039;t lose 2 BTC somewhere?!&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

				It will always take at least 6 confirmations in the network before it shows up, and each confirmation usually takes around 10 minutes ..... so when everything is running smoothly, you should usually see your deposit within 1-2 hours.<br /><br />As per the wiki:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: wiki</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t my deposit showing up in my account?&nbsp; It can take up to 6 hours for a deposit to be confirmed on the blockchain, processed, and credited to your Silk Road account.&nbsp; If your deposit still hasn&#039;t shown up, first check that it is showing up on the blockchain by searching for your deposit address on a site like blockchain.info (http://www.blockchain.info). If your transfer doesn&#039;t appear here, then it was never sent and you need to find out why from the person or organization who initiated the transfer.&nbsp; If the transfer does appear, then there could be a problem on our end and you should contact us.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Don&#039;t sweat it man it can take hours. It took me and a lot of people more than 12 hours at the beginning of the week. You will usually get it after 6 conformations but it took me like 100 last time.

				As already said, it takes time. Be patient :)<br /><br />In the future if you send using your own client, you can set a network fee so that the transfert goes faster...<br /><br />Anyway, don&#039;t worry, they&#039;ll end up on your account :)

				I&#039;ve had this problem before, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, they&#039;ll be there eventually as long as you used the correct address. It took about 2 hours for my coins to deposit earlier today, although I&#039;ve had them transfer over in as little as 20 minutes.

				Thanks a ton guys!&nbsp; So I shouldn&#039;t worry about depositing my additional 2 BTC then as well, even if the first 2 haven&#039;t posted?&nbsp; I am really excited to make my first purchases!<br /><br />I have products from 3 different vendors in my cart right now.&nbsp; Is it better to do 1 order (from a vendor) at a time?&nbsp; Or just go ahead and order all I want?&nbsp; This will be my first time ordering, but I also hear to use your real name, don&#039;t do FE ever, always read the reviews, never sign a package (plausible deniability), and everything should be good mailed right to my door!&nbsp; I hear PGP is for those who really need that extra sense of privacy.&nbsp; But other than that, am I really missing anything else?&nbsp; Thanks all for being such great helps.&nbsp; This is going to be amazing, while I am also nervous as all hell still too though.<br /><br />

Sounds like you have all the bases covered, take it easy and enjoy the road!

				I&#039;d be you I&#039;d make three separate orders, that way you can GPG encrypt your address with the right key for each vendor...<br /><br />It&#039;s really better to encrypt your address imo, in case SR database was hacked or whatever.. you don&#039;t want your address to be known by a potential attacker. Never trust anyone, not even those running that site - GPG is your friend :p

				I once made a second BTC deposit into my SR wallet and it never arrived. I had to ask Dread Pirate Roberts to look into the problem, and he solved it. But he did tell me that next time I should create a new SR wallet address each time I made a new deposit.
