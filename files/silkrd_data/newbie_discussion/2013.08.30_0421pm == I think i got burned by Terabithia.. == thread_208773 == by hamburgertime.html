				I&#039;ll start with saying that I&#039;ve orded with Tera before in the past and while he was EXTREMELY LATE he did come through in the end. This time i ordered his 50 bag bundle deal. I did express shipping and FEd because i saw a bunch of FE reviews.. well it&#039;s been 15 days since then.. <br /><br />3 days ago Tera finally repsonded to my daily messages asking what the fucks up. and said &quot;I am very sorry I will fix this today with in 1 hour!!!&quot; <br /><br />obviously he didn&#039;t fix it in 1 hour, because im still fucking waiting. days before then he said he&#039;d get me the tracking number in &quot;45 minutes&quot; and didn&#039;t read or respond to any of messages after that until days after.. <br /><br /><br />man do i feel stupid. he&#039;s taken all of his listings down so maybe he&#039;s just out of stock? The thing is is that i changed apartments which means if he did/ does send it, it will be sent back to the post office. after 5 days or so, if no one claims the package they will return the package.. i don&#039;t feel like this should be on me since 1. Terabithia refuses to read my messages and 2. He never gave me the tracking number, assuming he actually shipped it. <br /><br /><br />If time progresses and i still do not have any communication from him can some sort of action be taken? <br /><br /><br />edit: so he finally messaged me back after another 3 days of silence. he said the same thing he said the last 3 times. &quot;hold on, i sent it. let me get the tracking&quot; that was 6 hours ago.. amazing.&nbsp; he sends the same message every couple of days or so and then never gets back with the tracking. does he even look it up? why bother? he already has my money..

				like you, i have ordered a bunch of times from T. this vendor has slipped down so much lately. i hate to say it but you probably did get burned. this vendor has had issues for the past 3 months or so. always something. no excuse for his no communication, when he does he lies. marking in transit when he hasnt sent it. i ordered a couple of weeks ago and it took 9 days to get to me. too long. but i never fe. these fucken vendors should go back to the streets if they want fe. this is SR and escrow is made for all parties to be honest. you should try for a refund regardless. vendor has a track record and not a good one. tho he has been mostly on it with me but i dont like shady folks. i requested a refund with diesel therapy for a pety 3 xanax mints for standard shipping. free no refund. i got all my btc back when it didnt show by resolution. good luck. there are much better vendors. check out subsrgood, dragoncove, if you like heavily cut h with fent try ugs but i dont cuz he is another shady vendor not describing his product right and some have done reagent test and it came back with no trace of h. good luck! get that ticket started comrade. time waits for no one...

				Never message a vendor every single day.<br /><br />It&#039;s no wonder he ignored you and stopped reading your msgs.<br /><br />You should be put on the vendor roundtable buyer blacklist because that sort of harassment is intolerable.&nbsp; I&#039;d certainly not tolerate a buyer msging me every single day and it&#039;s ONLY BEEN 15 DAY&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;ll repeat, it&#039;s ONLY BEEN 15 days.&nbsp; If you&#039;re to msg him at all it should be once ... just before your order is about to auto finalize and your about to open a resolution case with SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />You of course made this impossible by finalizing early, and now you&#039;re here whining and BLAMING a vendor for whom you already acknowledged your succesful transaction when you finalized early, even if you didn&#039;t have the order.&nbsp; You finalized early, means you were satisfied with the order.<br /><br />The vendor did nothing wrong.&nbsp; You did.&nbsp; You finalized early.&nbsp; It&#039;s your fault.

				Dude shut the fuck up! hamburger dude do you. you did right. its your life and money. tho finalizing early is a bad&nbsp; idea. just be on it when getting your order so they get theirs. ignore shit holes like these uncompassionate idiots. im telling you try toplace a ticket for a refund to SR support. i got my btc when i choose a no refund policy on a free shipping no refund. just try and dont let folks discourage you. DO IT! again good luck. i know how you feel. it sucks getting duped. but you never know he might ship it later to make good but i wouldnt count on it. keep messaging him. even when listings are down you can still message them. good luck!

				That sucks. If Terabithia has really disappeared I&#039;m sure his other customers will be angry too. Good luck getting your money back.<br /><br />This kind of shit is why people say to never finalize early though. Never FE. Never FE. Pay attention, newbies.

				Burger you were totally in the right.<br /><br />What would T say? &quot;I didn&#039;t give this guy what he asked for, so he started messaging me every day asking why I hadn&#039;t done it ... everyone should blacklist him&quot;?<br /><br />Come on.

6 day&#039;s is no time at all, man you worthless fuck&#039;s who complain about transit time need to learn the meaning of patience.&nbsp; You also need to get yourself up to speed on real world even&#039;s like USPS cutting a significantly large number of it&#039;s employees.&nbsp; They simply cannot keep up with the load as fast as they could when they had all those other employees. <br /><br />You should msg the vendor once, right before auto-finalization, and if he cares at all about you and want&#039;s to work with you to rectify the situation then he&#039;ll respond.&nbsp; Otherwise you open a case with the SR Resolution Center, state your case and what you want returned to you, and then either the vendor continues to ignore, in which case the resolution team when they evaluate your order will likely give you a full 100% refund because the vendor was AWOL during the entire time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitching at him day after day, even if he hasn&#039;t replied to your initial comment in 6 day&#039;s is just going to anger him more and more each day and make it less and less likely they he&#039;s going to help you.<br /><br />Vendor&#039;s are treated SO badly by buyer&#039;s, and buyer&#039;s expect their drugs to be handed to them on a silver platter, and it must be the very next day or there&#039;s some problem (actually it&#039;s 3 weeks when you should start to be concerned ... this 6 day BS is what makes us so stressed).<br /><br />You fucking think you&#039;ll EVER receive this kind of service if you&#039;re going to buy stamps/bags on the street?&nbsp; Fuck no, i&#039;d be in and out as fast as my beating heart can take me.&nbsp; No vendor is going to stab or shoot you and take your money (like often happens on the street).<br /><br />In fact, the way that Vendor&#039;s treat their clients is a million times more professional and secure to your health then going to buy drugs off the street.&nbsp; Worst that will happen with a vendor is they&#039;ll steal your money.&nbsp; Worst on the street is they&#039;ll steal ALL the money you have in your wallet and then stab you.&nbsp; Or the smart ones will take your driver&#039;s license and debit card and tell you if you lie to them about your pin that they know where you live and will come hurt your family.&nbsp; That&#039;s incentive enough for me to give a street dealer my correct PIN, after which he&#039;s going to go immediately to withdraw as much money from my account as my daily withdrawl limit will allow, and then destroy your cards.&nbsp; <br /><br />That will not happen here.<br /><br />Finalizing is your acknowledgement that you are satisfied with the transaction.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if the vendor offer&#039;s you a golden ticket to Willy Wonka&#039;s chocolate factory if you&#039;ll FE, you still don&#039;t finalize until the product is in your hands !&nbsp; If the Vendor demands you FE, then you go look for another vendor ... unless your satisfied with your transaction before you&#039;ve even made it (which ... puts you in the cognitively challenged league).<br /><br />I cut sales to all American&#039;s because it&#039;s literally like treading on hot coals all day.&nbsp; They want their shit in 3 day&#039;s (and impatience is a MASSIVE pet peeve of mine, fucking learn to be patient you dicks).&nbsp; They want you to regularly communicate with them, whilst you have 50 other msgs that day to read and reply/take action to.&nbsp; They want you to double/triple vac seal PILLS.&nbsp; They order 100 pills and bitch and ask for a 50% refund because ONE, yes ONE pill was crushed during transit.&nbsp; They start hate threads about you without the dignity to make the Vendor aware that they&#039;re trying to ruin them through the forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />It had happened to me and i was fortunate enough to find the thread.&nbsp; When I explained the situation and the lunatic, people actually had BOTH sides of the story and what was a 2 page hate thread on me immediately turned into a hate thread on him, and loads of people apologizing and coming to his thread to set things straight.<br /><br />Did you ever consider the unnecessary stress that Buyer&#039;s put on Vendor&#039;s because they think that they&#039;re entitled to everything in the world?<br /><br />On the behalf of the Vendor, whom probably doesn&#039;t even know this thread exists, and who had to go with being msged over and over when you already told him you were satisfied with the transaction by finalizing it.&nbsp; Whether you got anything or not in the mail doesn&#039;t matter, you finalized, so you acknowledge that you did receive your package, even if you didn&#039;t.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you don&#039;t FE you dildo face.&nbsp; So I reiterate on the behalf of the vendor:<br /><br />The vendor did nothing wrong.&nbsp; You did.&nbsp; You finalized early.&nbsp; It&#039;s your fault.
