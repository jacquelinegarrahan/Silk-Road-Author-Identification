				Notes from the last SR outage.<br /><br />I first noticed the issue on a Fri.&nbsp; I was working from a remote access point and was unable to hit SR.&nbsp; Tor in general seemed flaky so I assumed &quot;I&quot; was the problem.&nbsp; Later that evening I tried again and accepted the chilling reality that SR was under a complete blackout.&nbsp; I&#039;m an SR user with some activity under my belt but admittedly a neophyte.&nbsp; Tor info boards were blowing up claiming DOS attacks.&nbsp; I had read about the legendary outage of 2012 but things had been working fine through 2013.<br /><br />Sun-&nbsp; Still no access.&nbsp; I remind myself I&#039;m not a drug addict but still feel cut off like one.&nbsp; What&#039;s going on?<br /><br />Mon --&nbsp; Brief sign of life on the SR but 3 click&#039;s in and I was kicked out and unable to re-login.&nbsp; The fear of isolation is being replaced by empowering frustration.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There has to be a place.&nbsp; Too many people out there who are used to this feeding trough for such a thing to wither away in silence&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mon Evn-&nbsp; Login to that dusty BMR account and find signs that vendors have relocated to support the SR Outage overflow.&nbsp; (This site has always been a mental red flag for me based on the title alone.)&nbsp; Bitcoins go through and I find a vendor who is waiving FE in consideration of the SR overflow.&nbsp; He is a busy man.<br /><br />Tues- Check order status (unchanged) - Begin reading the vendors bio page and realize he has had some recent drama which is cited as an excuse for late shipments and lack of confirmations (which is apparently a thing on BMR).&nbsp; Send email to vendor to check if he&#039;s waiting on anything from my end...A surprisingly quick response confirms he&#039;s not and will process the order asap.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wed - No package and no communication with vendor<br /><br />Thur-&nbsp; Check order status late afternoon.&nbsp; (unchanged) -&nbsp; The vendors page has been updated to let everyone know he will be even more disorganized due to a tragic family emergency which is currently ignoring to faithfully update his customers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fri-&nbsp; Check for arrival based on Tuesday&#039;s communication.&nbsp; It does not arrive.&nbsp; At this point I initiate dispute on the BMR indicating a high reading on my improbability meter.&nbsp; email vendor in hopes of clearing things up and let him know the dispute has been issued and why.<br /><br />Fri- Late evening&nbsp; .&nbsp; Vendor apologizes for the mix up and references family emergency as the reason for not sending my confirmation of the package that has already shipped.&nbsp; (***vendor claims the record is saved to a pc which is not available due to his current &#039;situation&#039;.)&nbsp; Multiple customers are leaving similar negative feedback but he responds to each and they rescind.<br /><br />Fri-Late Evening - into Sat Morning -&nbsp; Fear and loathing over what is motivating this guy and the fact he has an address.&nbsp; Is he just collecting shipping information from SR refugees or is he an immature chump trying to promise the world based on a mortgaged huffy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sat - No package.&nbsp; This confirms that shipping had not occurred when claimed and the promised confirmation # was never provided.&nbsp; I asked the vendor why he would save my shipping info to a computer in the first place which violates common sense and best practice on all levels.&nbsp; Within 30 minutes I had a refund and no explanation or follow-up.&nbsp; <br /><br />begin bitcoin cleaning procedure and debate whether to let them go altogether.&nbsp; I did not want to leave them on BMR which I was beginning to have worries about in general.&nbsp; In the end leaving them there seemed just as risky as moving them out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sun -&nbsp; Investigate &#039;Atlantis&#039; which appears to have shown up out of nowhere and has a number of listings basically copied from SR.&nbsp; SR is periodically coming online and boards indicate people are heading there.&nbsp; My concerns for this site were raised when they were able to list a high number of &#039;non-drug&#039;&nbsp; items which typically sell slowly.&nbsp; This creats the illusion of a&nbsp; fully functional site but there is no way that many miscellaneous vendors jumped ship and systematically re-posted their listings to &#039;Atlantis&#039; (unless I&#039;m very much out of the loop).&nbsp; &nbsp;There are other similarities which suggest the site is either working off the same database or was outright copied.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mon-&nbsp; SR is back online and is not kicking people off.&nbsp; With no hesitation I transfer all of my BC to old faithfull.....<br /><br />Mon evening -&nbsp; Still waiting on BC to arrive.<br /><br />Tues morning - still waiting on BC to arrive&nbsp; (much activity on the forums regarding the cause of this delay which is impacting everyone).<br /><br />Tues late evening - BC arrive -&nbsp; Naturally, since the site is fully functional again.&nbsp; I place an order(s) with complete confidence.<br /><br />I was baffled why someone on BMR would troll for sales with no attempt to FE but a very elaborate attempt to keep the story going.&nbsp; My first conclusion was LEO but on further inspection I noticed that their &#039;product&#039; jpg&#039;s had 800 #&#039;s imbedded.&nbsp; A lookup on these returned a Narconon hotline.&nbsp; (is that it?&nbsp; are Scientologist trolling for potenial drug addicts? Any other experiences would be appreciated.<br /><br />~forumuser001<br /><br />

				So as not let my first post go without any replies...Something weird happened that disrupted normal buying patterns (for a while) and several&nbsp; sites (BMR and Atlantis) received the overflow.&nbsp; My experience indicates that nothing but BS existed on the other side.&nbsp; Was this a coordinated effort or just typical everyday BS for everyplace that is not SR?
