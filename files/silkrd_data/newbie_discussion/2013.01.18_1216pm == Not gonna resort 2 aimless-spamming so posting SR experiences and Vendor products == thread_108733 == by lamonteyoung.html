				Hey,<br /><br />Have previously vented my reluctance to spam for a member status [http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108303.0], and now not pursuing those negative vibes, as in the last 7 months I have always advocated the underlying ethics of a free market SR community.<br /><br />So instead of aimlessly spamming rubbish, I intend to post all my SR experiences and anything helpful for Nuubes (which I kinda am, but have transacted 7 times).<br /><br />Then hopefully someone will get something positive out of this somewhat counter-intuitive and monotonous experience.<br /><br />&#039;Words are a lens to focus oneâ€™s mind&#039; <br /><br />Feel free to attribute to the turning of the negative to the positive :)<br /><br />Lmy

				My first order was from a vendor no longer on the road (Reich), but he was great, he helped me fix my PGP issues and had great Ket.<br /><br />All of the vendors I have delt with so far have been like this, as long as you have some perspective and use your common sense, they get like 100 messages a day.<br /><br />

				Another vendor I cannot recommend high enough is dmtdoodeelsd...me and loads of my mates have had pretty much most of what he has listed [herm herm, apart for the viagra], and all has been great and delivered in a reasonable time.<br /><br />He has also bent over backwards to help a mate out before, much respect to the guy.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/16e11f8977

				The only semi negative experience I have had is a &#039;Doublesided 200ug Acid blotter&#039; from Mr Shah.<br /><br />He was nice and we communicated, but the tab didn&#039;t seem like lsd, it was quite speedy feeling without the same feeling of clarity and empathy, with little visuals, think it was a synthesized version.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not change my feedback in time before all of them disappeared for some reason, think it was because I have a couple of months break to try and be good and get all my uni work for the year submitted?

				In my opinion, never click a link to SR, I have heard of so many people losing all their bitcoins because of Phishing (fake websites ht look like the real SR, but have been set up to obtain your details.<br /><br />I have a suspicion it happened to me too, but fortunately I use PGP for pretty much everything (its easy to set up, use it!), and had almost no currency.<br /><br />If all of a sudden you cannot access your account, and are pretty sure you did not change your password, create a new account and message SR support, they sorted mine out within 24hrs and were fantastic.<br /><br />I now write the SR URL down (in a pad) and manually put it in to avoid this!!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The hardest thing for me since joining the road, is the safe acquisition of BTC.<br /><br />Its a tricky one here in the UK as there are sooo many scammers, do your research! <br /><br />Whatever you do, never go on MTGOX or Intersango whilst on Tor, I have read several times it flags up.<br /><br />I first used Intersango via their Debit facility, a little risky as the bank has all my identity information, but as I only buy for personal use the ease tempted me.<br /><br />If using this service make sure you use bitcoinfog or some other tumbler to make them harder to trace.<br /><br />

				If you can find a reliable contact, even a vendor this can be a good way, but tread carefully!<br /><br />Cash for BTC is the safest.<br /><br />Check the forums, here is one I am monitoring:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83535.0

				Recently been thinking about growing my own Mushrooms for the spring time sunshine, a combination of both Psychedelic and just edible mushrooms like Oyster and Shitake, just for me and my girlfriend.<br /><br />I have done allot of research recently into this, and if you have attention to detail [I have mild autism so a big tick from me] and a small financial outlay (Maybe Â£30 for everything) you can do it.<br /><br />Here is the guide I started with:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_mmgg.shtml<br /><br />

				A better guide with videos is here - www.shroomery.org<br /><br />A very nice vendor called Omnis gave me the info, even though he has never had an order! He has only give out free samples, but he says this does not matter too much to him, as he is not in it for the money.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d866b330e4<br /><br />Sending my positve vibes over to the guy, hope he manages to achieve what he wishes.

				I think they knew that the 50 post minimum would result in garbage, and so they deserve garbage.<br /><br />They just want to compartmentalize the bullshit from people who aren&#039;t willing to google.

				MrDutchGuy&#039;s fentanyl, in powedered and nasal-spray form, is phenomenal. Not only is it top-notch quality - he also tends to hook people up.

				My advice is to never finalize early even if vendor is trusted, not finalizing protects in my opinion both the customer and the vendor. For example, I shred DCN once customer finalizes. People usually message me asking me if I want to finalize early and I always say no.<br /><br />Also if you are unhappy for some reason approach vendor with class instead of insults and the vendor will want to help you and discuss some kind of solution. Last, ALWAYS read profile of vendor and listing of what you purchased before purchasing so you know what to expect from vendor. <br /><br />
