				So I had never done LSD, never knew what to expect and to be honest was nervous to try it. I stumbled upon the Avengers LSD review, and that is where I found this vendor, Tesselated. I was surprised to read that his LSD actually did test out as 200ug because most vendors fudge the numbers. His prices were fair considering he was one of only few vendors selling at that low of a quantity at the time. I decide to go for it. About 8 days later, the product was delivered to the mailbox by the USPS. I opened the mail and got very VERY angry. Tess forgot to send the LSD! I almost threw it away... but then I found it in a clever location. And my journey begins.<br /><br />-(0.15)I called my friend over, it was time to watch our favorite TV show, or so he thought. He shows up and I show him the bag. &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; he says and I nod with a smile.<br /><br />(0.00)We drop the tabs. They are laid on white fluff I think, most other tabs just feel like copy paper. The is no metallic taste or numbness on the tongue. After about 20 minutes the tab has dissolved into tiny pieces so I swallow it. I hop on the computer and wait for it to kick in.<br /><br />+(0.45)I can&#039;t focus very well. I am not sure at this point what is about to happen. Then I notice something strange, the words on the screen are moving up and down like the ebb and flow of a wave pool when viewed from the side. I ask my friend if he sees it too &quot;No... wait... yeah actually I do.&quot; He opens his laptop which has a background of pandas puking rainbows, which is normal, except that the rainbows were actually moving across the screen and changing colors. It was beautiful.<br /><br />+(1.30)The TV is making too many indiscernible noises. We decide to mute it, turn out the lights, and listen to Radiohead, a band I had never heard before. The music came on, playing the most beautiful song, it was chanting &quot;Everything... Everything&#039;s is in it&#039;s right place&quot; The hum of the keyboard was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. I closed my eyes and was enveloped in a strange gold and red fractal. I forgot how to open my eyes, but I didn&#039;t care because I was in such a beautiful place.<br /><br />+(2.5)We walk out of the dark room, it was getting too weird... our thoughts had no basis in reality. We walk into my roomates room. He grins and looks at us and we both start cracking up uncontrollably. Still not sure why that was so funny. I take my friend to look at my psychedelic picture collection. I stare at a picture of a fractal humanoid in a forest and watch the seasons change rapidly along with the colors of the picture. I smile because it was so calming and comforting to me. It was whispering to me saying it was my guide. I show my friend and tell him to stare at it. I watched his eyes constrict to focus on the screen... then they dilated extremely rapidly into utter darkness. He stood up really fast and said he had to leave the room.<br /><br />+(4.5)My friend comes back and I ask where he was. He says he was in the bathroom watching his beard change sizes and that he was surrounded by elephants and tall statues. He continued telling me what he saw but I couldn&#039;t pay attention. I line of unrecognizable faces were flying past his face so I couldn&#039;t decipher&nbsp; who he was.<br /><br />+(5.0)I go to my kitchen to get some candy. As I open the smarties wrapper I saw a powdered rainbow. I could taste them with my eyes, this provided me with much joy and amusement as well as confusion. (See the rainbow, taste the rainbow?)<br /><br />+(6.5)I go outside to smoke. The sound of jets taking off and large semi trucks fill my ears(I live in the country). I decide the cigarette isn&#039;t worth it. So i go back inside.<br /><br />+(8.5)I am coming down now, my friend however is very worried that he won&#039;t. I spend a good hour trying to calm him.<br /><br />+(11)No noticeable effects to report except for general happiness and content

				Glad to hear you had a good time! For other first timers I would recommend doing it outside in nature without other non-tripping humans around! You&#039;ll have a blast! Doing psychedelics inside a house/dorm seems like it would be fucking boring!!<br /><br />Go outside! Go Camping!
