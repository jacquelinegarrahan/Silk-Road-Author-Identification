				I heard about this company Parcel Motel that operates in the UK and Ireland, although I would imagine there are similar companies out there. I can&#039;t explain it any better than the website does (http://www.parcelmotel.com/about.html) but it initially seems to be a safer alternative to renting a PO box as I&#039;m currently doing. You can easily use a different name, any packages requiring signature the company signs for, you don&#039;t need to use a credit/debit card or ID to register/pay. I have heard they use cctv at the collection sites. Just wondering if anyone has any experience using this or similar services &amp;/or further info?

				I signed up for Parcel Motel for legit internet purchases. I had to provide my card details (so I could add credit to my account) to sign up, so it would be traceable to you, unless you got a friend to use their card to sign up for it. How do you register without a card? Just curious :)<br /><br />I&#039;d be curious to see if your packages arrive, if you do go ahead with it. Let us know how it goes if you do use it :)

I haven&#039;t registered yet but I&#039;ll let you know how it all goes if I go through with it

				I am based in Ireland ;)<br /><br />EDIT: I looked up the website and it seems that you don&#039;t need a credit card to register. If you do decide to use this service, get a throw away phone that isn&#039;t registered to you. Hope it works out for you :)

Honestly the more I look into it the safer this seems. Plus you get two free deliveries after registering so you don&#039;t even have to worry about pre-paid cards or anything, no reason not to keep registering under different info and get a few burner phones.

				If it ever was before, now that you&#039;ve gone and created this thread in a public drugs-in-the-mail forum, I would not consider the Parcel Motel viable much longer at all.
