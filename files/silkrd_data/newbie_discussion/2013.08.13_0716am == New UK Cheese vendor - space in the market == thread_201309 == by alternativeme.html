				Hi<br /><br />I am a longtime user (abuser) of Silk Road. I have been considering vending for sometime now.<br /><br />I have been involved in the drugs trade for many years, and have been cultivating for over 5yrs. My skunk is of the highest quality and it&#039;s expertly trimmed and cured.<br /><br />How would people feel about a new UK Cheese vendor? I think I can improve on the current offerings on the road; both in terms of quality and price. I believe I can get to a price of around 9 or 10GPB per gram.<br /><br />Is there space in the market?<br /><br />How to get started? Discounted samples?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />AM

				I think you&#039;re on to something here.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t much of a selection of UK cheese on here other that &quot;the herbalist&quot; and &quot;MrCronk&quot; to name a few.<br /><br />Other than a lack of choice, there isn&#039;t any clear indication of the taste, stength, look ect. of the buds.<br /><br />You could do; 1/8ths at £30, Q&#039;s at £55, H&#039;s at £100, O&#039;s at £180.<br /><br />That would &quot;cut the arse out the market&quot; so to speak :D&nbsp; With a good quality product there&#039;s no reason why you couldn&#039;t make a killing.<br /><br />Only thing first is getting your rep up.&nbsp; Giving out free/discounted samples will quickly generate positive reviews!<br /><br />If you decide to go for this, feel free to hook me up with a sample! :D and i&#039;ll leave some glowing feedback<br /><br />Peace

Not sure I could cut magins quire that further than 9GBP on the gram, whatever the quantities. It&#039;s a weird market at the moment.<br /><br />Does one send samples via the forum. Is there anyway that I could send it via SR and the feedback could be left on there??
