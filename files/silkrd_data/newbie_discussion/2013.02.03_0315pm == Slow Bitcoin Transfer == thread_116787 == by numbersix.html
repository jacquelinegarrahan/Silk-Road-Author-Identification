				Its been about 36 hours and no bitcoins have showed up in my SR wallet.&nbsp; It was a direct transfer through Bitinstant.&nbsp; All addresses correct and everything confirmed as delivered.&nbsp; I have contacted SR support for over 24 hours with no response or resolution.&nbsp; Let me know if anyone has ever encountered such a problem or if anyone has any advice.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Have you looked up your SR BTC address in blockchain.info? How many confirmations are there? 36 hours is very long, it shouldn&#039;t take that long. Did you copy+paste the address?

				Give the support some time. They might reply slowly sometimes, but in my experience they&#039;re generally really helpful.<br />

Did you fully synchronize your wallet at that time, or was it a transfer from a third party?

				I don&#039;t know where you are, but if in the US the BEST exchange is Blue Sky Country. I made my bank deposit to their account and by the time I got home (45 minutes), my bitcoins were here. They are GREAT. There is a link to them here. Good Luck, SQ ;)

				I&#039;m waiting on Bitstamp to deposit â‚¬200 euro into my Bitstamp for 48 hrs now. I&#039;ve used them before and they were always ok, I hope it&#039;s there by end of business today or I&#039;ll be thinking I can kiss goodbye to the money. Anyone else ever have problems with Bitstamp
