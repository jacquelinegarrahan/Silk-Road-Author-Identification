				Sorry, I&#039;m sure this topic has been covered a gazillion times over. Am currently a first time &quot;buy curious&quot; (thanks Arrested Development) SR shopper. <br /><br />I keep reading that the odds of your drugs being detected coming through customs are pretty slight, but it happens. That&#039;s enough to scare me off buying from overseas vendors (due to personal circumstances, I can&#039;t have a drugs rap). But if buying domestically, the risk is next to nothing, and I&#039;m tempted. Is this true? What kind of screening does domestic mail go through - if any? I&#039;m in Oz. <br /><br />Getting dope sent to your door just seems out there. Surely it can&#039;t be that easy?

				Your only real risk of domestic post being intercepted is if it is obvious whats in the package without opening it for example if someone puts weed in a package without vacuum sealing it, you would be able to smell it through the package! The amount of domestic post that that needs to be dealt with over night means that they just wouldn&#039;t have the resources to check everything so what actually happens is nothing gets checked!<br /><br />I understand your fear of overseas as that does have a chance of being seized at customs when crossing borders but as for domestic.... no borders.... no customers.... no worries!!<br /><br />Just read the vendors reviews to see what people say about stealth and don&#039;t go with and vendor that is accused of having bad stealth and you will be fine!<br />

				Well yeah if your package happens to be open someone looks in and it is obvious what it is then you may have trouble this is highly unlikely.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read reviews where a package actually was open, product fell out, PO worker put sealed it back up and sent it off.&nbsp; I think it was BHO or something so maybe it wasn&#039;t a big deal.<br /><br />I guess if your product was stuck in distribution center over the weekend and it wasn&#039;t properly sealed it could be detected, I&#039;ve heard they bring dogs in to sniff for stuff like that.&nbsp; But if you go with a reputable vendor that seal properly or arent buying smelly stuff then you don&#039;t have much to worry about.&nbsp; If you saw the facilities they use to sort and transport packages you&#039;ll see there isnt much in the way of screening, not like they do for us at the airports.

				I have only ever received one package that had been opened, and that was a book I ordered from an independent press that wrapped the entire envelope in masking tape with some weird plastic lizard underneath the tape. What I&#039;m saying is that for domestic stuff, you really need to draw attention to your package to get it checked, so any vendor with even the slightest modicum of professionalism will be fine with their packaging.

				Domestic orders do get seized. I&#039;ve found this is due to sloppy packaging mostly, but also not having a return address on the envelope/package.

				And if your stuff gets seized...blowback?<br /><br />Surely they wouldn&#039;t just seize narcotics, send you a note saying banned substances have been intercepted being sent to your address and sorry it&#039;s been confiscated, have a nice day? Surely they&#039;d bring in the cops?

				The chance of domestic seizure is small but not unheard of.<br /><br />Packages can get caught in the conveyor belts and torn open, vendors can be under survelience, etc.<br /><br />Unless it is a large amount they will go after the vendor, not the consumer. If they stumble upon a distributable amount they may start and investigation of give you a controlled delivery.<br /><br />Very rare, but not unheard of!

				I&#039;d say very small, unless there is a pot plant sprouting out of your package
