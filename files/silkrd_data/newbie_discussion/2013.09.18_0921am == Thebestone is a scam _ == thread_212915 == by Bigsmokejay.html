				Hey guys, have you seen thebestone&#039;s listing yet ?<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/eeaf1821aa/10<br /><br />His prices seem to good to be true and he requires that everyone FE&#039;s. I don&#039;t trust this guy and neither should you. I haven&#039;t seen a single post claiming that they received their goods and yet everyone keeps on FE&#039;ing. If you got scammed by this guy could you please post in this thread ? Scammers like him should be banned.

				I noticed all the FE.....unbelievable, you all forget escrow is there to protect you, it isn&#039;t just there for looks.<br />Half the vendors asking for FE haven&#039;t even been a vendor for 30 days.<br /><br />I ordered through TBO for a friend over 20days ago, so as far as i&#039;m concerned, their stealth is lame, for it was sent to a virgin drop, and has not arrived.<br /><br />

				This vendors stealth is really lacking.<br /><br />He does not use Mylar bags, only vacuum seal which just isn&#039;t good enough.<br /><br />I only ordered from him for a friend who likes his speed, me personally, i don&#039;t touch it.<br /><br />Has been almost a month, so i told him to forget about it, i wont be ruining my perfect stats over a cheaply made in-organic product.<br /><br />So i released the money although my friend never received the product. Just letting you all know, the order was sent to a virgin drop, clean as can be, and it still didn&#039;t make it. So don&#039;t burn your drops for this loser.<br /><br /><br /><br />I should have searched better, but when it comes to speed, well fuck i just bought whatever. Have found someone else for him, so i hope that goes well.<br /><br />Thebestone is not worth it, any vendor who cant get that in is not worth the time, effort or money.<br /><br />Feedback rating says it all...
