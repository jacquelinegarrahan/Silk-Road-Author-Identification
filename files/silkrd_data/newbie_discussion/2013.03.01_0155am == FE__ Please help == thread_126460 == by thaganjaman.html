				A seller is asking me to FE for a VCC, I&#039;m being told this is standard on VCC since there is no way for the seller to prove that the funds is transferred to the card in case of dispute.<br /><br />What is your thoughts on this?

				My thoughts are every time you do an FE with a new vendor for drugs it&#039;s a 50-50 you don&#039;t get anything . Any other product/service is less than that, 85-15 maybe you don&#039;t get screwed.

				What is a VCC?&nbsp; Have you researched the vendor at all?&nbsp; What do other people say about the vendor.&nbsp; The only 2 times I&#039;ve FE&#039;d, the vendor was highly rated, and I didn&#039;t get burned.&nbsp; I&#039;m really curious about what a VCC is, though.

				Not everyone who asks to FE is a scammer.<br />Just check the vendor&#039;s feedback and if you don&#039;t trust it than Don&#039;t FE.<br />hope the transaction goes well.<br /><br />

				If you&#039;re a new customer, vendors often ask for FE.<br /><br />Some vendors never ask for FE regardless of your status.<br /><br />Some vendors ask for FE only on certain items. <br /><br />It all depends on the vendor.<br /><br />There&#039;s no set rules for FE, but if you DO FE and something goes wrong, you&#039;re pretty much on your own. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t FE and the item never arrives, you have options via SR resolve.<br /><br />In my opinion, you should research the vendor. Check their feedback and check their review threads thoroughly. <br /><br />FE is always a risk. You effectively pay up-front.<br />When I first joined, I FE&#039;d once and it was fine.<br /><br />Some people may get burned, but in all honesty it&#039;s your choice. <br /><br />If it&#039;s not a huge amount of money, just do it. Chances are you&#039;ll be fine.

				Thank you for all your replies. I will take the chance. <br /><br />How do I make sure the sellers feedback is good? On ebay I would never deal with someone who hasn&#039;t at least 100 deals and 99.8% positive feedback. How is the system here ?

				I try not to FE as much as possible. Im not gonna say i have NEVER done it, but what I did was FE a small order so if it was a loss no big deal, and then once I was sure vendor checked out I would place a larger order. This way you can also build rapport with the vendor so they can trust you as well.

				I agree, I wouldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; The only time I did was when I was new and had no history, but I researched the vendor heavily and they were top 3% rated and had been around a long time.
