				Ok I&#039;m fairly new to SilkRoad so I have some questions regarding Canada, specifically Canada Post and Domestic Shipping Inspection. Does anyone on here have any direct or indirect knowledge from someone who would know, like from a current or past employee of Canada Post? Or Canadian customs even?<br /><br />I for one am very nervous about ordering anything from out of Canada that would have to come threw customs. My question is as far as Canada Post Domestic Shipments, are they ever inspected on any level? Do they even do random package x-rays of packages only shipping domestically from one province to another province? Considering terrorism these days and the fact that I&#039;m sure some packages traveling from one province to another province must be transported by plane on some occasions, do they x-ray these packages looking for bombs or contraband? Also do you know if they sometimes use k9 drug sniffing dogs to screen packages going down a conveyor belt or something? Or are dogs/X-rays absolutely never used on domestic shipments going from one Canadian province to another Canadian province? Like is the only chance of it being detected is if the package or envelope rips open by accident, or if the name/address isn&#039;t clearly readable and it&#039;s opened for inspection.<br /><br />Also have any of you fellow Canadians ever had any drugs seized by customs that you ordered from another country? If so what happen? Did the police question you? Have any of you fellow Canadians ever had a domestic province-to-province package/envelope seized or just not show up? If so again what happened?<br /><br />Sorry for the rambling, just looking for some real world knowledge, not just speculation. Thanks guys/gals!<br /><br />-LokeToke

				Keeping it domestic is your best bet, in my opinion. I&#039;ve used various mom sites over the years and I&#039;ve &quot;lost packages&quot; at certain facilities several times. Point being, I&#039;d just have no signature required, delivered to another residence and that&#039;s that!

				I have had 3 packages seized by Canada customs, all 3 times i received a scary official looking letter<br />the letter asks you for your signature to give them permission to open it to evaluate its value for tax<br />purposes. it states if no reply is received by 30 days it will be returned to the shipper address or be<br />destroyed. i have never replied back, and have since did a test buying LSD from Germany that arrived<br />safely. My suggestion is only buy LSD from other countries, letters are not scrutinized as much as<br />&nbsp;packages, We also did 2 tests to a friends address, not mine, and both times sucessfully got 1/10th <br />gram Heroin samples from Leeds UK<br />and NewYork city to Winnipeg. lol<br /><br />Watch tv shows like To Catch a Smuggler / Border Security, they show how mail is treated at customs<br />&nbsp;and the drugs they find.<br />
