				Im a noob and I wanted to write a review of my first sr buy. I bought some coke of Dispater and it is bang on...exactly what the reviews said. I got a message a few hours after telling me it had been dispatched. Got it the next day...wow was quicker than even ebay.lol.<br />The coke itself is perfect. clean and straight rush. I wish i knew about SR and dispater before...oh well....to the furture

				Having looked around at other vendors, tried and tested a few grams of the stuff that is £110+/g, and not sure what to think of it compared to my local coke, I get nice local stuff for 0.5g for £50 and it tasted very similar, not sure if I have very good connects or not.<br /><br />Anyway... decided to give dispaters a shot, just ordered 0.5g to test the water, for £38 im not sure what to expect....<br /><br />I mean you are technically getting more bang for your buck with this stuff as it goes further, more quantity/ depending on what the quality is like ill update with info..<br /><br />queryox.
