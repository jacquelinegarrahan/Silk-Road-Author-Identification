				Hello all.&nbsp; Hope you&#039;re all good.<br /><br />There is probably a link to this somewhere, but I&#039;ve not managed to find it after looking for an extensive 38 seconds.&nbsp; Do any of the &quot;more experienced&quot; users on here have any sites for the purchase of bitcoins to recommend?<br /><br />I first started looking into bitcoins in 2011.&nbsp; I thought it was a really interesting, cool idea.&nbsp; However, at the time, I didn&#039;t know of anywhere I could really spend my bitcoins, so the interest soon dwindled.&nbsp; Hindsight is wonderful and I should have persevered.&nbsp; I think the bitcoin valuation was at about $11 USD back then.&nbsp; Now I see the valuation ranging from $140 to $195 USD per coin.&nbsp; This is great for those in possession of a lot of them, but obviously not so good for anyone just beginning a bitcoin journey.&nbsp; This seemingly exponential growth in bitcoin value also places many things for sale on this amazing site at a much higher than average value.&nbsp; However, I digress.<br /><br />I have seen people selling bitcoins on Silk Road for a little as 50 Euros per coin.&nbsp; I have also seen them for sale on certain sites between 140 - 195 USD per coin.&nbsp; This latter price seem a little excessive to me, when gauging the valuation of the coin against said item for sale on this site.&nbsp; <br /><br />So...I&#039;ve not managed to cut a long story short too well.&nbsp; My point and question is - are there any means users on here would recommend to buy bitcoins?&nbsp; <br /><br />Gracias.

				the fear of collapse can only be answered by fast buying and trading. I mean- you think about buying coins because you want a product off the road? buy and trade as fast as possible to minimise the probable possibility of them decreasing in value. The tendency of them to further increase in value looks too good to be true but it rose for the last 4months steadily so you might even have an increase of buying power if it continues.<br />I think everybody who is into them for longer than half a year is laughing their asses off if they take into account their exchange current when purchasing coins months ago. <br />If you think about buying for holding them as an investment you should seriously think about holding on to them for a long time if the current goes down in the future. <br />dont invest money you cant afford losing.<br />good luck<br />
