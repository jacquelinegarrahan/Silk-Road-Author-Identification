				&nbsp;Not really into coke, nor am I an advocate of its use. (I hate it). But I do like soda, and you guys like cocaine so...<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyone ever try any vintage coka-cola? Vintage as in either from when they used cocaine in their cola, or just putting coke in you&#039;re coke&nbsp; ;D<br />It seems like something you might do. If so what was it like? Bet it tasted like gasoline.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I refuse to spam tell 50! Principles man! 8)

				My grandfather is a huge coke memorabilia collector, he has some of the coke from back when there was actual coke in it unopened, Iv always wondered how strong it was, but its worth a small fortune to collectors so he would kill me if I tried to drink any.

				I actually had an opportunity to try a product from red bull that was name Red Bull Cola. Originally when it was first released it contained coca leaf extract and some other actual caines. The caines and coca leafs were actually a very nice compliment to the cola drink that it was inside. I wish coca cola made it the way they used to because I now know what it was supposed to taste like and what it tastes like now. The coca leafs cut down the super sweetness off it as well as giving you a little rush. It was quite a drink. Unfortunately the FDA caught wind of it and within 2 weeks the product got removed from shelves. <br /><br />If you have an opportunity please try it. Coca cola should not taste the way it does.

As I remember it tasted like complete shit. But then maybe I got my hands on it after they took the stuff out. I have trouble believing that though. I take it you are not from the US? I can&#039;t see redbull company tainting their products with coca leaf without getting their company out right banned in the US.

				I am in the US. I mean the ingredients on the side of the can said that it had coca leaf in it. Then 2 weeks later it got banned. <br /><br />http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1900849,00.html&nbsp; ***clearnet warning***<br /><br />That is a link to an article explaining that many countries found traces of cocaine in the drink. Germany, I believe france and USA.

Hard to believe a respected company would taint their product like that. The amount of cocaine are so low though that it doesn&#039;t pose a threat. Which makes me believe that they we&#039;re importing coca nuts from the tropics (Or wherever) Where it maybe just got tainted by harvesters and workers.

				Well red bull did state that they used processed coca leafs. Just like the way coca cola did back in the day. Seems like the same thing to me. I think it is the process that coca cola used to use. Giving it that taste that it is supposed to have. Maybe I read that article wrong.

After 20-30 minutes you get a pleasant uplifting high and a nice buzz in your head X) The effects last quite long, about 1-2 hours. But remember: long high means worse crash. The next day I was tired as fuck. Should&#039;ve used a little less maybe :)
