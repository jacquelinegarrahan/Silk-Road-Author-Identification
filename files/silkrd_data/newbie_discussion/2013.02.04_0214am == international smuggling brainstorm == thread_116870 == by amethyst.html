				Ive been planning on how to best post drugs abroad and thought to combat intereptions it must happen in two stages<br /><br />1. Mask the smell from drug dogs<br />2. Mask the package from x-rays<br /><br />As far as dogs go, ive heard moisture barrier bags are the only way to truly seal a package, and the aluminium layer is so thin, it will not be detected by the x-ray<br /><br />As far as the x-rays go, ive seen images of cocaine for instance hidden inside candles, the x-ray reveals the cocaine because its density is different, so although both show up orange, as organic, the coke is darker or vice versa.<br /><br />How about forming a candle out of cocaine, so it actually looks like one in an x-ray. And sealing it in the mbb bag so surely both areas are covered.

				How do you intend on separating the wax from the cocaine later?<br /><br />Sounds like it could be harmful for the end user.

				you dont separate any wax, no wax is involved in making the &#039;cocaine candles&#039; you just re-rock the cocaine into the shape of a candle. The candle is 100% cocaine.

				In the thread by that postal worker, I read that packages shielded from x-rays are instantly suspect - sounds like painting a target. The key is making it as mundane as possible. Fake bottoms in drawers work because people don&#039;t expect secret shit under your socks or whatever. You don&#039;t expect an antiques dealer to be laundering drug money. I just read about a guy who sent acid out in membership cards that needed to be cut around, so it was all sealed. I know it doesn&#039;t get any easier than acid to hide, but that&#039;s what I mean - plain sight.<br /><br />Also remember that dogs smell far, far better than we do, so it&#039;s not just about &quot;stopping humans from being able to smell it&quot;, but &quot;making sure the smell could never get out, ever&quot;. I suppose that&#039;s the other purpose of vacuum-packing. Again, in that thread, when people tried too hard, like masking weed with coffee, alarms went off in the inspectors&#039; heads.

				Hey,<br />I actually think the idea of re-rocking coke into less suspicious shapes is a good idea. Candles could work, and so could plates and cups. The only issue you might have is if someone inspects the package and wonders why the candles are meticulously vacuum packed :p<br /><br />An idea I had a while ago is to use powdered coke as the contents for a number of egg-timers, like the ones they have in board games. If the timers were made of glass and sealed properly then I don&#039;t think it would smell, and if they were sent in good packaging, e.g. a box labelled &#039;Mathew&#039;s Board-Games Supply House&#039; then they wouldn&#039;t be too suspicious. It would also be easy to bury the coke-containing timers amongst ones which just had flour or white sand, as long as they all looked uniform.<br /><br />Just my little idea,<br />- JH

Like the candle one too. Also, yes - look as inconspicuous as possible. My parents used to smuggle stuff through airports (dumb), but whereas my dad looked like a weed-smoking hippy, my mum looked very repecible, so he went through first and he always got stopped so they were busy when she went through. I still wouldn&#039;t try that these days though - airports got alot hotter after 9/11. <br /><br />One point I would make is that, if I were a customs officers, I would be monitoring threads just like this. I would suggesting only sharing ideas, but if you&#039;re planning on using any of them soon maybe consider keeping it to yourself. Just a thought... That said, still too much mail to check everything and customs officers are not me - if they were that clever they wouldn&#039;t be customs officers!
