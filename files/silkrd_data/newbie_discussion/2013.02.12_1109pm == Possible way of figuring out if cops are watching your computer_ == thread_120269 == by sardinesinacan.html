				OK, this whole idea might be retarded.&nbsp; Feel free to say so if it is.&nbsp; I got it from watching The Wire.<br /><br />If you have any reason to believe the cops/feds have a tap (or whatever they would call it) on your computer, don&#039;t pay your internet bill for a while.&nbsp; If you start getting &quot;Past Due&quot; notices and all that stuff, chances are no one is looking over your shoulder.&nbsp; If you are getting internet service for free and nobody&#039;s harrassing you for money, chances are the cops have &quot;flagged&quot; your account, meaning they&#039;ve told your ISP to keep your account active because an investigation is pending.<br /><br />Like I said, I got this idea from a TV show, so it might be completely off base.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				Even if the police are watching your connection, they would need to hack into your computer to see what&#039;s on there, they cannot watch Tor traffic .. (does any MS Windows have a built-in backdoor ?)

				I don&#039;t know factually any which way, but it seems unlikely that the cops could force a private company to provide service and less likely that the police would pay for it. If you stopped paying and it went out, I don&#039;t think that would be conclusive of anything.<br /><br />What episode of The Wire was this?
