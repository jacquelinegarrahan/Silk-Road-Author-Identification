				Has anyone received orders to an address they have already had some not delivered to previously?<br /><br />I love to know how effective a &#039;Flagged address&#039; is?<br /><br />

				How do you know your address is flagged? <br />Maybe you have been scammed by a selective scammer like me.<br /><br />I ordered some blotters which didnt arrive... i was asking for a reship. vendor said he reshipped it ...nothing show up. I got paranoid as hell and cleaned up house ...everything.<br />Few weeks later i tried another vendor ---&gt; domestic delivery 1 day and everything was fine.<br /><br />thats my story

				Just wondering - people on here mention that you address can be flagged by customs (apparently).. I&#039;d love to know if you still get orders to that that address after an order hasn&#039;t turned up...<br /><br />Nah haven&#039;t been scammed - I&#039;ve had one International delivery not turn up from a vendor i had half a dozen from in the last 6 months.

				I&#039;m not saying that customs don&#039;t discover packages ever BUT I have received thousands of legit international packages over the years and have NEVER had one go missing. Ever! <br /><br />In that time I have had three &quot;opened and repacked by customs&quot; so obviously I would have lost three packages if ordered via SR.<br /><br />From reading the forums here, I think it is clear that non-scam packages only get found if the vendor is sloppy with their stealth, in which case, they aren&#039;t worth ordering from anyway (but how are you to know). <br /><br />I also reckon Australia gets shitloads of selective scams because of the the bullshit myth that our customs are so full on. They are not any better or worse than anywhere else!
