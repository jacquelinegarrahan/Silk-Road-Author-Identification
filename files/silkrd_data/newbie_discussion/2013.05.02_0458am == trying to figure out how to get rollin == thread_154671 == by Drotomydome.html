				Hey guys,<br />I am new to silk road and am just trying to get all this together so i can put an order in tomorrow. i dont live in a medical state and the opportunity to get some cheeba chews, homecomb wax, and doses just cant be ignored :) So i got my tor browser and was able to get on here, but now I am not sure what to do. Do I need a tor email in order to get bitcoins? I was planning on going to walmart and didnt know what the procedure was of getting bitcoins. I tried to get a tor email earlier and kept getting the response &quot;Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required &#039;/home/tm/templates/general_error.php&#039; (include_path=&#039;.:/usr/local/share/pear&#039;) in /home/tm/modules/global_http.php on line 11&quot; when trying to set up an email account. Do I have to get this tor email or is there another way to get bitcoins and order product on here without one? If someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Basically just trying to figure out if I need a tor email and how to get the bitcoins with/without the email? Thanks for helping me out. I know it sucks helpin out the noobs but i truly appreciate the help guys. hope everyone has a good night

				I got started last week and this is what I did.<br /><br />1: Made an account on SR<br />2: Found someone on the site who would convert moneypak from walmart into bitcoins.<br />3: Took the risk and bought a 200 dollar moneypak and sent the info to coinXchange on SR<br />4: Received the coins in my SR account within an hour<br />5: Spent all my coins<br />6: Waste time on the forums until the mailman comes.

				There are literally endless options, combinations of options, and seedy darknet schemes to buy and mask BTC&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Browsing through the security board will turn up plenty of similar threads and many How-tos.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had experience with Bitinstant although they&#039;ve been having some long delays here and there.&nbsp; Have not done that in a little while.&nbsp; BTC-for-cash vendors can also help (BlueSkyTraders is one reputable example) but there is a higher degree of risk there.&nbsp; Just as with moneypack you are putting your money in someone elses hands&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; &nbsp;Do your research and be comfortable with their reputation.<br /><br />Like with stocks, never &quot;invest&quot; what you can&#039;t afford to loose.&nbsp; No method is 100% airtight here.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the exciting, and risky parts of a black market

				I&#039;ve been looking around at vendors on the silk road to get Bitcoins as well.<br /><br />Check out BluSkyTraders page<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9f0dd63e28

				You need to take the time to learn about what you&#039;re doing. Rushing things along so you can place your first order tomorrow is the last thing you need to do. You don&#039;t sound like you&#039;re anywhere close to being ready to order. Educate yourself before you dive in head first. There&#039;s quite a few guides that members have put together for people just like you. I suggest you read through them so you have an idea of what you&#039;re getting in to. This is a good starting point ----&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140099.0<br />

				Thanks guys for the help. I understand the seriousness of getting your dick wet without knowing what you are all doing and getting your self into. So i got on bitinstant and mtgox and have my payment slip printed out, just have to go to walmart to give them the $. So correct me if i am wrong, once I give them the payment and the slip, they send it to my tor email with a mtgox redeemable code for bitcoins? I then send it to my bitcoin wallet? But how do I send that to my silk road wallet and how do I even access my silk road wallet? I think I am getting a jist of what to do but would like to know from some experienced members if Im headed in the right direction and how to finish the last bit of this process with getting my coins to my silk road account. Thanks again for the help.

				I spent about two weeks just reading this board before I actually tried anything. It&#039;s tempting to dive right in but for me personally, I wanted to feel like I had a decent grasp of what to expect.<br /><br />I highly recommend blue sky traders for bitcoins.
