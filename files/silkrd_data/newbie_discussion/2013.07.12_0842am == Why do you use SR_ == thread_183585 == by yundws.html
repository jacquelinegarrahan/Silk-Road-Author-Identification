				1. Don&#039;t have any local connections and am not about to go walking around the streets looking for any.<br />2. Product quality and selection is much greater here than the streets.<br />3. I might get &#039;robbed&#039; or scammed here but it won&#039;t be with a gun in my face or a pipe to my legs!<br />4. Let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s cool, kind of a &#039;sticking it to the man&#039; feeling to use the man&#039;s own resources to get your product delivered to your doorstep.

				Got older stopped raving so lost good contacts,the street stuff round here is terrible and either sold by scumbags or chavvy kid&#039;s wouldn&#039;t waste my money.<br />To be honest now i&#039;ve found SR wouldn&#039;t buy any other way&nbsp; &nbsp; :)

				Moved to a new state and don&#039;t know anyone, and as I am an &quot;older&quot; guy, I&#039;m not about to start hanging out at highschools or college campuses, and the &quot;street&quot; is too sketchy and risky.&nbsp; Have not &quot;indulged&quot; in about 6 years due to the above!&nbsp; SR is the way to go!&nbsp; Love it!!

				Have dealt with too many dodgy dealers who pretend to care about customers but really couldn&#039;t give a shit. Sick of overpriced stuff and sick of having to wait for them to come up with a product they claimed to have but don&#039;t.<br /><br />This place is amazing, the quality seems so much better, the vendors more honest, the product is the focus. In the midst of sorting stuff out so I can make a first purchase soon. Nervous but excited.

				local connections have &quot;disappeared&quot; over time, and making new ones that you can trust with quality is a hassle; too much cut crap out there. this is the ebay of drugs xD more options, better prices and reviews jajaja glad i found out about sr.

				Why the fuck wouldn&#039;t you use SR??? The best that street dealers can possibly hope to achieve is to be on par with the quality you find on here, and the reviews of an entire community is far more trustworthy than the words of said street dealers so now my IRL dealers only get my custom when I can&#039;t be bothered to wait for my orders to arrive.

				Because I live in an area where it&#039;s practically impossible to find anything besides weed and bad hash. Now I&#039;m the biggest dealer in town because I&#039;m the only one who knows about Silk Road.

				No local lsd connects and quality here is great compared to on the street.&nbsp; You can research and find the most pure products through lab tests and such.&nbsp;

				Most things are available to me from contacts off of silk road, however its awkward and time consuming to set up these deals, especially in small quantities. <br />In essence though, I fully believe in the &#039;ethics&#039; behind silk road and hope it leads one day to drug legalization through one means or another, whether that be through &#039;normalization&#039; of drugs to the masses and removing the element of dodgy, ruthless people to deal with OR by leading to a downfall of major political classes/structures in an organized anarchist fashion!<br />I would much prefer the latter but think the former may be more likely, and one day would lead to a better and more enlightened world through full understanding of the physce!
