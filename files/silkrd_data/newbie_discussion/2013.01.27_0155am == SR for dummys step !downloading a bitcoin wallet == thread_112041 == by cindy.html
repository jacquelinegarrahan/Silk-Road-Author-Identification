The most important things to do while getting started are to read/remember the following:<br /><br />-- Read The Dread Pirate Roberts&#039; introduction message (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion//silkroad/about)<br />-- Read the buyer&#039;s guide (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide)<br />-- Remain anonymous. Do not share any personal information, details, locations, etc. with anyone. Use a strong password that is different than your regular password for legitimate sites. When you place an order, you are running a risk and it is possible that the person on the other end is law enforcement. No system is full proof, but SR has a good track record. Just be careful and only share the secrets of Silk Road with trusted friends who would use it responsibly. If you&#039;re concerned that you might ever be visited by LE or have your home searched, it&#039;s a good idea to store all damning digitial evidence (programs, keys, passwords, etc.) on a micro SD card, which can be hidden anywhere with little chance of it being found.<br />--Use the forums (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion). Reading will answer your questions, posting will share your knowledge with others, and doing both will build this community into something that we can all be proud of. Most of us already are. While you&#039;re trying to build up your 50 posts to get your Jr. Member status, why not try to answer as many questions as possible and make some new friends? Spamming is the whole reason for that dumb rule in the first place. The 50-post rule separates serious users from yahoos and &#039;bots, even if it is a pain in the ass. I made my first couple of posts before the new rule came down; and while it sucks being sent back to the minor leagues, as it were, I understand the reason for the policy.<br /><br />Right. And that&#039;s what I intend to do with this thread--answer some questions and share what I know. I discovered Silk Road by accident less than two weeks ago. I spent an evening on Google, teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it.<br /><br />Here are a couple of pretty good technical articles about Silk Road, both of which were instrumental in me getting here:<br />-- http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road.<br />-- http://dailyanarchist.com/2011/06/21/how-and-why-to-get-to-silk-road/<br /><br />So, read buyers&#039; feedback, the forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t finalize early (FE). Some legitimate vendors require customers to FE--especially new customers or when shipping to another country--but you should have no trouble finding awesome vendors who DO NOT REQUIRE THIS. (I recommend only ordering from domestic vendors, as your package will not by scrutinized by Customs. While most international orders go through fine, why risk it if you don&#039;t have to?) There are lots of choices on SR, so shop around for a vendor you&#039;re comfortable with. I personally would rather give my business to a vendor who respects the escrow system--and if he&#039;s a top seller who has great feedback or I&#039;ve done business with him in the past, I might decide to FE as a favor. The only time you should FE is if you are doing it specifically to reward a vendor for excellent service.<br /><br />FINDING A GOOD DEAL FROM A REPUTABLE VENDOR:<br /><br />First of all, locate the product that you want to buy and your options should be arranged by bestseller in descending order. Compare the prices and when you see something that looks promising, click on the product link and read ALL of the information there, especially the feedback at the bottom. When it comes to feedback, read a few pages. Next, click on the seller&#039;s name to go to his/her page, where you can read more about them and note their stats. Look at several vendors and compare prices/feedback before placing an order. Some vendors charge more, but it&#039;s because they have a better product, faster shipping, better stealth, etc. Decide what you&#039;re willing to pay and if extra $ is worth it. Now you should head over to the forums and find a thread on the product you&#039;re interested in or on a specific vendor. This is where you will get your most detailed information. If you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for, post a new topic and ask. It is also worth mentioning that new vendors often post awesome deals to bring in new customers and establish themselves. Take advantage of the deals by placing a small order as a test, that way you won&#039;t be risking much. Do this a couple of times and wait for stats to build ... but don&#039;t wait too long to place a larger order or you will miss the sale price.<br /><br />OBTAINING AND TRANSFERRING BITCOINS:<br /><br />A common problem seems to be finding an easy way to get bitcoins. At first, this can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Use the following instructions if you&#039;re in the USA and you won&#039;t be scammed.<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account or use your real info unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- In BitInstant, use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- While logged into your Mt. Gox account, use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transferring funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release. There are many other options, but this one works and it is the one I&#039;ve been using.<br /><br />USING PGP TO ENCRYPT MESSAGES AND YOUR ADDRESS:<br /><br />Using PGP to encrypt your mailing address is not strictly necessary, but it adds an extra layer of security to your transaction and many vendors request/require it. I&#039;ve found that Portable PGP (download available at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/) has a very nice interface and is easy to use. I ordered from one vendor who said not to use this version (I don&#039;t know why), but I did anyway and my order came as expected. I&#039;ve placed three orders now with three separate vendors, all of which were executed flawlessly.<br /><br />Other PGP downloads:<br />-- http://www.pgpi.org/download/<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html<br /><br />A few good places to learn about how to use PGP are:<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.en.html<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html<br />-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto<br /><br />To download and install Portable PGP, visit http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/. Once you&#039;ve installed the program, to use Portable PGP, copy the vendor&#039;s public key into a .txt file and save it. When you open the program, you can import contacts from .txt files on your computer. Once a vendor&#039;s address has been added to your keyring, you can direct a specific message (such as your mailing address) to him/her. There is an &quot;encrypt&quot; tab, which provides you with a blank text box. Write your address or message, select your recipient(s), click &quot;encrypt,&quot; and it will open a separate window with your PGP message. Copy this string of gibberish into the SR mailing form.<br /><br />As I said, I&#039;ve tried several versions of PGP and this one is the easiest to use. No problems so far.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Okay, that&#039;s it for now. I think that I&#039;ve covered the basics here and provided some good references; and while I&#039;m no expert, I&#039;m happy to help by sharing what I know. Hopefully I haven&#039;t forgotten anything important, but I will update if something occurs to me. Let me know if you have questions or suggestions for doing things better.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay A.K.A. The Prince of Darkness

Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transferring funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release. There are many other options, but this one works and it is the one I&#039;ve been using.<br /><br />USING PGP TO ENCRYPT MESSAGES AND YOUR ADDRESS:<br /><br />Using PGP to encrypt your mailing address is not strictly necessary, but it adds an extra layer of security to your transaction and many vendors request/require it. I&#039;ve found that Portable PGP (download available at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/) has a very nice interface and is easy to use. I ordered from one vendor who said not to use this version (I don&#039;t know why), but I did anyway and my order came as expected. I&#039;ve placed three orders now with three separate vendors, all of which were executed flawlessly.<br /><br />Other PGP downloads:<br />-- http://www.pgpi.org/download/<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html<br /><br />A few good places to learn about how to use PGP are:<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.en.html<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html<br />-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto<br /><br />To download and install Portable PGP, visit http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/. Once you&#039;ve installed the program, to use Portable PGP, copy the vendor&#039;s public key into a .txt file and save it. When you open the program, you can import contacts from .txt files on your computer. Once a vendor&#039;s address has been added to your keyring, you can direct a specific message (such as your mailing address) to him/her. There is an &quot;encrypt&quot; tab, which provides you with a blank text box. Write your address or message, select your recipient(s), click &quot;encrypt,&quot; and it will open a separate window with your PGP message. Copy this string of gibberish into the SR mailing form.<br /><br />As I said, I&#039;ve tried several versions of PGP and this one is the easiest to use. No problems so far.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Okay, that&#039;s it for now. I think that I&#039;ve covered the basics here and provided some good references; and while I&#039;m no expert, I&#039;m happy to help by sharing what I know. Hopefully I haven&#039;t forgotten anything important, but I will update if something occurs to me. Let me know if you have questions or suggestions for doing things better.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay A.K.A.

One is some sort of state issued ID like a drivers license and the other is a utility bill with your address on it. While it is not illegal to buy &amp; sell btc, they will have records of who you are and which transactions are yours. And, don&#039;t ever access MtGox from the TorBrowser, they will flag or freeze your acct.
