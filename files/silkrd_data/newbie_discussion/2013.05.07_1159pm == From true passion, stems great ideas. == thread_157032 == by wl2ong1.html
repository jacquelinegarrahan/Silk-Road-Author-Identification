				I made a name prior to this one and I couldn&#039;t post or PM anyone to figure out what was wrong with it. I figure it was just glitched so I made a new one that now matches my SR... It is what it is.<br /><br />Since I need 50 posts to post anywhere that my input is useful, I have decided to start this thread so I can build up. Here is goes.<br /><br />Up until about January of this year I held to the belief that &quot;Reggie&quot; (Shit dirt weed) was always the way to go because of the price/quantity.. I never put much thought into the attributes and uses for medicinal cannabis as I had no constant access to it until I hit a local connect that had true medicinal cannabis... Since I always had it, I started testing different ideas about smoking it (I don&#039;t have the money for a vape right now and I am not going to get a cheap one, but this is on the to-do list, haha). I&#039;ve found a way that works for me. <br /><br />Continuing... I was diagnosed last October with Lupus (I quit smoking shit weed 6-7 years ago because it wasn&#039;t worth the way it started fucking with me. This was because it&#039;s quite possible that I&#039;ve been living with Lupus since 2001 and didn&#039;t find out until 2012 and this explains a lot over the last 10 years. This sent me down a terrible path of &quot;I don&#039;t give a fuck&quot; where I got into meth pretty bad, started slinging it... I was in a bad place, but without going through that, I would have never come to my current beliefs about MC.&nbsp; I had got to a point that I wanted away from the Meth. I wanted to be done with it for good. I had got to the point that I felt like shit 18-19 of 20 days.. The first strains I got were Sativa dom.. I didn&#039;t know at the time, but this gave me more energy and made me feel so much better than any prescription drug I had taken, way better than anything meth could have done for me. From that point I started learning the difference between Sativa and Indica. I started trying to get every strain I could of MC, started learning, started testing and seeing how I reacted to them and over the last few months, I have come to believe that I have found my path. I can help people. I can leave a positive mark on the world when so many people just want to shit on everything. They are so selfish, so greedy.. They don&#039;t care who they step on or who they hurt as long as they get what they want... <br /><br />I want to truly help people... There will always be those that don&#039;t care what they smoke as long as it&#039;s &quot;dro&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, I&#039;ll still help them out and make money from them, but my idea, what I believe after so many years of not knowing what the fuck I wanted to do with my life, I truly believe I have found my passion. My path in life.&nbsp; I want to bring MC to people that don&#039;t have it as an option in their life and then I want to educate those people on how MC can really help them and they can get away from prescription drugs that are only killing them... I want to be able to bring multiple strains to those that it will truly help with pain, appetite, sleeping, no energy, etc... Whatever is ailing them, MC WILL help them without the effects that prescription drugs cause... If they can&#039;t smoke it, I&#039;ll offer them edibles... Anyway that I can possibly help the people that truly need it, the ones that are struggling and trying but because of federal restrictions do not have access to a dispensary. I will find a way to help them.. I am still in a state that it is illegal, but I have a 5 year plan. I want to open my own dispensary with my own grow op... I want to bring more to those less fortunate... <br /><br />I have so many ideas that I am sure have been used and many others I haven&#039;t heard.&nbsp; If you read this and have some input, negative or positive... Please feel free to leave it. <br /><br />Thanks for reading. Hope your week is everything you want it to be. <br /><br />&quot;A friend is someone who isn&#039;t asking for a hand out, will give you their opinion rather good or bad when you ask for advice, but when you choose something they do not agree with... They do not put you down, they do no judge you, they are not bias about your choices... But they are there when those choices drag you down. When your bad choices leave you flat on your back, they will be there to help you get back up.&quot; <br /><br />Don&#039;t know if someone else has this quote, but this particular variation is my thoughts on a true friend. They are very rare... Make sure to treat the ones you have like a friend, not a benefit.

				I guess I really don&#039;t have anything practical to say, but I think it&#039;s a great idea, and that you should definitely do it.&nbsp; We need healers in this world badly, and to be one is a higher calling.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thank you. I haven&#039;t thought about it as being a healer, but I suppose that would be the best way to describe it.

				I was hoping more people would have something to say. I&#039;m not really interested in spamming meaningless shit. I&#039;d rather say something useful.
