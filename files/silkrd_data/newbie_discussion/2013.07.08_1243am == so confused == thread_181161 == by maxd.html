				localbitcoins.com is definitely the first site I&#039;d use for &quot;anonymous&quot; bitcoin purchasing/selling, but anonymity is overrated. <br /><br />Just be smart about buying coins:<br /><br />If you&#039;re a buyer of small quantities for personal/personal+friends use (which the majority on here are I assume), purchase coins only when you&#039;re going to be spending the coins relatively soon afterwards. Use a laundry service (ex. BitcoinFog) if you&#039;re really paranoid or your gov has you under surveillance (heh, as if you&#039;d know!).<br /><br />Also, SR mixes your coins whenever you deposit into your account, so keep that in mind.

Look man, when you send the coins to your SR account, they become anon. At that point no one can prove anything without having admin access to SR. That&#039;s not likely to happen.<br /><br /><br />On the subject of badass BTC services, I recommend BTCQuick. Yes, you have to provide dox. Yes, they require verification. Yes, they charge +7.5%.<br /><br />However, they just give you a private key with the BTC loaded on it. That, in my opinion, is more secure than sending the BTC to an address. You can load the key on your wallet client (qt doesn&#039;t support this) with no problems, and can delete the entire wallet when finished if you&#039;re paranoid. Easy.<br /><br /><br />*Edit* Try Multibit. Nice client.<br />
