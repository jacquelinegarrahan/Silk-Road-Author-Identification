				Obviously I am very new to everything here. <br />I have been trying for almost two weeks to get Bitcoins and damn I am finally frustrated enough to ask here. <br />Virwox was recommended after Coinbase flagged me as high risk or something and told me to piss off. <br />Virwox took some figuring and I thought I finally had it. I transferred my funds from those Linden things they made me buy into Bitcoins. Then I get the reply that my order will take an additional 48 hours to process manually. OK, fine whatever. <br />NOW Virwox is showing no BC balance and so is Silk Road, where my BCs were supposedly transferred.<br />Does Silk Road take time to process? I tried really hard to do everything correctly.<br />I went into my account, changed my PIN as per recommendation by Silk Road, then copied the string of numbers and letters provided to me by SR and pasted into my Virwox BC withdrawal.<br />Help? Please?

				Bitcoin can take up to 4 hours to clear into your SR wallet when transferred from an outside one.<br /><br />I have never had anything to do with Virwox though, hope you weren&#039;t scammed...

It usually registers the deposit when there is about 7 confirmations. This can be anywher from about an hour and a half to 10 hours or so. Most BTC transfers take 2-6 hours.

				I would suggest starting an encrypted electrum wallet to send your coins to, then to your SR wallet. Or send it through multiple wallets randomly. Other than that, your transaction is going to be fine, it&#039;s just going to take time.

				From my understanding you can&#039;t tell what is a SR wallet and what isn&#039;t. SR also uses some kind of tumbler that disguises transactions. I use blockchain.info I copy and paste my SR wallet address and conduct a search. Your pin is what keeps people from stealing your coins just like on a debit card if that is the kind of safety you were referring to.

				Blockchain.info says this:<br />No transactions found for this address, it has probably not been used on the network yet.<br />When I pasted in my SR wallet address.<br />Is this normal while it processes or whatever for the possible several hour wait? I don&#039;t know exactly when Virwox released my BCs

				No, you should see the transaction being broadcast to the P2P network. You would see the transaction amount and how many confirmations it has. If you don&#039;t have any info on it yet then nothing has been sent to that address. A transfer is immediately registered on Blockchain. Sorry bro. I haven&#039;t used/heard of Virworx. Just regular old Mt. Gox and CampBX for me. I recommend CampBX, their coins are always cheaper.

				When you transfer coins into SR it usually takes a few hrs. For me it takes about 2 to 3 hours. Nothing to worry about. Just keep checking every half hour or so and you should be fine. If in 4 or 5 hours still nothing, then come back to the forums and I&#039;m sure someone can help you in your next step. But I wouldn&#039;t worry, just give it some time.

				Did you go straight from VirWox to SR??<br /><br />From what I have read alot of sites monitor wallets that are inside the tor network and they could refuse transferring.&nbsp; I think it was MtGox that started doing it.&nbsp; If they saw a transfer from their servers to a SilkRoad Wallet they blocked the transfer from occuring and locked the person&#039;s MtGox account.<br /><br />

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				That&#039;s a very good guide MedicineWoman.&nbsp; Only thing that i do slightly different is to go from the online wallet to a local PC wallet. That way my first hop isn&#039;t tor based. <br />

				localbitcoins is a great way to get coins, and is the only method I use anymore, and Ive done it all. You can to a face to face transaction or via over the counter bank deposit.<br /><br />I get the coins deposited into a blockchain wallet and then into SR. Since blockchain and SR tumble their coins, I don&#039;t bother with a service such as bitcoinfog.<br /><br />Ive been doing bitcoin business like this for about 1 year, everything&#039;s still running sweet :)

				I have only had limited Tor access or I would have replied this morning. <br />OP get the coins.<br />Virwox came through this morning after an email to customer service. It was due to their longer than advertised waiting period, but everything worked out, it seems. <br />As for the replies recommending localbitcoins, I did take your advice. I found someone on Reddit that seemed trusted and he delivered with great communication and fast service. <br />Thank you all, this seems like a great community.

				so if you need bitcoins, going through localbitcoins.com is the best way, and one of the only truly anonymous way to buy is via cash deposit at a bank.&nbsp; I did this through my Chase down the street with this guy:<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/22396/purchase-bitcoin-cash-deposit-chase-bank-united-states<br /><br />I deposited the cash at my Chase branch (no questions asked, nicer than anything to me), emailed him the receipt image, and within literally 2 minutes, I had my coins.&nbsp; To top it off you can read vendor feedback and history, etc.&nbsp; There is even an escrow system.&nbsp; It really is the best by far.<br /><br />The process is almost instant, but Chase needs to be open, of course, for you to make the transaction.<br /><br />Good luck to you.
