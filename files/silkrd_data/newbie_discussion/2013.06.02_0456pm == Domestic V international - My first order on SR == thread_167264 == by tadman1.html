				OK so I&#039;m pretty new here at SR and have placed only a few small orders so far. My biggest concern was &#039;am i gonna get ripped off&#039;, &#039;will my package arrive&#039;. I figured to start with a small order see how that went and go from there. I am from the UK so thought to start with a UK vendor so not to worry about customs. i found some good listings but not so much variety (plus what i was really after was some coffee shop weed mailed form the Netherlands!) anyways, to cut a story short...(i am stoned and rambling here...) I made two small orders for my first experiment here on SR.&nbsp; I ordered 1.1g Jamaican weed domestically and two pre rolled joints from the Netherlands (1x NLX, 1x mixed whites) the Jamaican was advertised as free next day UK delivery, the pre rolls were B0.04 + B0.01 additional item for delivery. i ordered the pre rolls on the 23rd and the Jamaican 24th. Just over a week(and a bit of worrying about it turning up/getting intercepted) i received the first of my parcels! The excitement was crazy, my girlfriend was laughing watching me jumping about like a little kid when i saw the postie coming up the path :) i saw he had a beige envelope in his hand so knew this had to be it! i nearly ripped it out of his hand through the letterbox i was that excited to get my hands on it. when i had it i saw the postage stamps weren&#039;t English, this was two pre rolled joints straight from the Netherlands! The order I was most worried about turning up and it had gotten here first. it was like Christmas. Opening the package I really couldn&#039;t believe how well it was sealed up, it looked like a factory job, machine done. The whole process (from ordering on SR to arrival at home) is so easy! It&#039;s just like Amazon :) Since smoking my pre rolled joints I have made another order from the vendor&nbsp; &nbsp;LightningBud&nbsp; &nbsp; When I made my first order this guy saw my stats so knew I was new to this. He helped me out at every point, messaging me frequently putting my mind at ease. Unlike a lot of vendors he doesnt ask you to FE early (I dont like the FE idea at all!) which helped a lot trusting my first order. He has proven to be a man of his word, and the product was great :) he also has helped me out with a custom order, gone out of his way to suit what i was after.&nbsp; &nbsp;As it stands I am still waiting on my Jamaican weed from the UK, no communication from the vendor yet... (and this guy is among the top sellers i have found) I have since made another international order from my new fave dealer&nbsp; LightningBud&nbsp; and the way things are going I will probably receive this before my damn Jamaican. Still, no worries, at least I&#039;ll be smoking some top quality weed :) Cheers LightningBud
