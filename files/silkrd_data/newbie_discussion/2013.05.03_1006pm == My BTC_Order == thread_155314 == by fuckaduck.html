				Sorry, but can you please sort this crap out, I have money sitting in there I need, if you can&#039;t sort your damn site out can you just give me back my coin, and I&#039;ll go somewhere who doesn&#039;t charge 10% commission, but still cant be arsed to pay to stop a simple DDoS attack. Sorry DPR, but this is taking the piss, what do you want me to do wait for you to sort it out yourself, PAY SOMEONE TO SORT IT OUT, YOU HAVE THE MONEY. I don&#039;t have that money to lose, you&#039;re rolling in the shit from this site, just pay for someone to fix the damn problem.<br /><br />I had faith&nbsp; in the beginning, but I&#039;m losing it fast, this is pure shit, and it&#039;s taking the piss, I can&#039;t check 24 hours a day to see the 15 minutes you might have the site up. ANd I can&#039;t wait for this to kill the btc rates and make my coins worthless.

				Patience, young padawan.<br /><br />Bitching here isn&#039;t going to help you at all. You think because you&#039;re throwing a hissy fit, DPR is just going to magically stop the attacks? SR has been up for the most part these past few days, so if you have any BTC you need to withdraw from your account, you should&#039;ve already done it. Sure, it might take 10 minutes of refreshing to get to the login page, but so what? At least it was possible and you had a chance. I, as well as many others, got in to our accounts, withdrew our BTC and even placed orders.<br /><br />Do not blame others for your own incompetence, it only makes you look immature.

				No, I have a job, I am not throwing a hissy fit, I want my money, and I want my orders. and all of this crap is getting on my nerves, and I haven&#039;t got time to check all the time, every time I&#039;ve checked for a week the site has been down. I am already down money wise through unstable BTC rates, and DPR can have this sorted if he tries, a DDoS attack is easy to sort out, if he paid the what $2000 commision he&#039;s got from me alone. It&#039;s not like he hasn&#039;t earned enough money from me for me to get a little pissy when I get screwed and don&#039;t even get a reply to any of my questions.

				Wow, so rude, am I not entitled to a simple reply from DPR telling me something that&#039;s going on, after paying him over $2000 of my own money just to use his site? I haven&#039;t got $2000 in there, that is money I have paid him personally through his commission. Grow up and take drugs? - great solution, I think you&#039;re the one who needs to do a bit of growing up buddy. If this was a legitimate business, I&#039;d say it was the worst customer service, with the highest taxes, and crappiest service ever. To not send me a reply at all, or tell me what&#039;s going on. I&#039;ve paid him $2000 just on this account, through his 10% charge, and that 2 grand entitles me to an answer of some kind as to why I can&#039;t get my money, or my order.<br /><br />Christ, you guys are total lemons, pull your tongues out of DPR&#039;s arsehole, and admit - he made a shitty site, where you can&#039;t even organize things by price low to high etc. like EVERY other site that exists, a site that fucks up, and he can&#039;t handle a DDoS, or pay any of the probably millions he&#039;s earned on sorting it out. You should be mad at him too, his customer service is ridiculous, and his site, though useful, is erroneous, and in need of major improvement, he just doesn&#039;t care. It&#039;s his cash cow, so screw the little guy who has put faith in him and just wants an answer from an SR support team.

				I have waited a week, this is why I am getting pissed off about it. I have only been able to use the forums for a week, I have sent a menage to DPR a WEEK ago, he may be busy, but I expect some kind of reply. I don&#039;t have the time to check SR every day, we are all civilized, agreed, but I feel like I&#039;m being ostracized&nbsp; here, for wanting no more than any other customer would want from a company that has their money frozen in holding, and is already thousands of dollars richer from their business. Yes, you&#039;re withdrawing, and withdrawing sucks, I know, but what do I know about this situation? I know that DPR hasn&#039;t PAID anyone to try and fix these problems, they need to be handled by professionals, and considering he has $2000 in commission from a small customer like me, he&#039;s got MILLIONS to sort this problem out, he&#039;s just not doing it, he&#039;s got MILLIONS to just give me my damn bitcoins back which I need. I have put faith in him for over a year through good and bad times, and shown my support for a week in these difficult times, and now I&#039;m annoyed, I get no answers, no product, no money, and DPR doesn&#039;t give a flying fuck about even telling us what&#039;s going on, other than &quot;This is well planned, they&#039;re using lots of tactics, it&#039; s hard to stop&quot;, yeah? Well hire a god damned professional team then, a team who knows what the fuck they&#039;re doing instead of trying to sort it out yourself with the community.

				I don&#039;t propose he sort it out, but I think someone should be, and DPR should be paying them to do it. From my very limited knowledge of hacking, so I could be completely wrong on this, a botnet causing a ddos can be taken out by finding out the server causing this attack, have it decrypted, to lose it&#039;s FUD capacity, then distribute that information to AV companies. Then the hackers Admin tool, whatever, RAT I think it is, will be useless, because they basically all are now without crypting. Even if it doesn&#039;t take out the whole network, it&#039;d take out a huge chunk.<br /><br />Besides this, I want to apologize for my attitude yesterday, I know, shit happens, light up, be happy. I&#039;m hoping Tyl3r Durden comes onto the forums, so I could speak to him, I&#039;ve FE&#039;d for him before and the money is all there in SR, the site literally crashed as I was making the order, I&#039;d like to see if he could help me out and FE so to speak, for me, until SR is back up and running.<br /><br />I also realize DPR is doing what he can, this can&#039;t be easy, and he&#039;s made things so easy for me in the past year and a half or so I&#039;ve been here, because before, I was importing in completely different ways, and there was a lot less trust, you had to test the waters and lose a lot to find the diamonds (Even though there also have been some great clearnet places in the past).
