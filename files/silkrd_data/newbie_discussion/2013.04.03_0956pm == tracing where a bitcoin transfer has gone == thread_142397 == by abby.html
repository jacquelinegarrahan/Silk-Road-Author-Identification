				I think I know that the transfers are anonymised and unless someone really goes looking then they&#039;ll not know where it was moved to.<br /><br />Is this true or am I completely wrong?<br /><br />I wanted to transfer a bitcoin out of the exchange where they&#039;re sitting and bypass having to get it into my wallet before moving it on to here but I don&#039;t really want the exchange knowing where it&#039;s going.&nbsp; Is this risky behaviour? I think it would be ok but I bow to the greater knowledge of the peeps here.<br />

				Not sure if this is true, but I have read here that SR tumbles your BTC before they appear in your SR account for anonymity.

				Depends on how paranoid you are.&nbsp; I always click to create a new address every time I fund my SR account and it just shows up as an empty address with no transactions on it.&nbsp; The coins show up in your account as soon as they get 6-10 confirmations in the blockchain and then from there they&#039;re supposedly tumbled before they get to your vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s all public information and can be viewed on blockchain.info by typing in your SR address (use TOR if you do this just in case.)<br /><br />Anyway if you&#039;re just buying personal use quantities I very highly doubt any harm will come to you.&nbsp; In any case, transferring to your wallet and then to SR does almost nothing to annnomize you since one hop is very easy to track in the blockchain.&nbsp; You may as well just transfer straight form the exchange.&nbsp; If you&#039;re buying larger quantities or if you&#039;re super paranoid consider using a mixer service like bitcoinfog.&nbsp; That&#039;s how you get real annonomization of your coins.&nbsp; I used them a while back and it worked out for me though they do charge a fee.&nbsp; You also have to trust them pretty well if you&#039;re sending large ammounts because there&#039;s nothing stopping them from shutting down and running off with your coin (though the same could be said about SR) but they&#039;ve been in business for a while now and I don&#039;t remember hearing about any such scams occurring.

				In the end I decided just to transfer it as I reasoned the same thing.&nbsp; Unfortunately now I have to wait 48 hours because it&#039;s my first transfer out of that exchange and they&#039;re going to do a risk assessment (they do them to stop money laundering etc).&nbsp; That&#039;s not a problem - except it means it&#039;s going to be another couple of days before I get the coin here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had forgotten about that. duh!
