				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />always wondered if people actually bought that shit haha... why risk getting a package seized (inspector thinking it&#039;s weed) for some trim? lmao fucking trim though... weirdest/grossest thing is sometimes on the comments for these trim listings people will be like &quot;actually smokes pretty good, thanks!&quot;... like wtf you smoking that shit for? <br /><br />i&#039;ve grown MJ for a couple years now and other than my first couple years I just threw the trim away because it was too much hassle for too little reward ( i used to end up with about 2 grams of hash or alot of not that potent budder)<br /><br />trim&lt;&lt;&lt;

				CaliforniaDreamin is supposed to have good shake. It&#039;s 85$ an ounce, if the quality is as good as in the feedback it would be a good deal. <br />I could cook that into edibles and easily quadruple profits. Has anyone got any of it? Id love to hear a somewhat in depth review... Its not listed right now since she doesnt have big supplies

It&#039;s suprisingly quality for for price. Keep in mind it is certainly not the same as buds would be but fairly close.<br /><br />To get where I wanted to go when vaping I normally vaporize 0.05g-0.01g, with this it&#039;s 0.2g-0.3g to get where I want to be.<br /><br />Totally vastly worth it.

Of course people buy weed in the mail, along with rob banks and embezzle money. The same principles go for all three. Its kinda stupid, its very rewarding, and if you&#039;re smart you get away with it most of the time. <br /><br />Not everyone is in the same situation. They could not know anyone who sells, or if they do the quality might suck, or they might not have very many options, or it might be too expensive. <br /><br />I personally feel safer ordering from someone I trust and pick it up in the mailbox then meet a dealer in person where alot more things can go wrong and the weed isnt even that good.<br /><br />Ideally I would just grow myself but thats not really a viable option right now.<br /><br />And are you saying that getting heroin or coke shipped to you is a better idea? <br /><br />Could you please respect each others choices? You&#039;re not going to convince anybody who has already ordered weed in the mail not to.

Where do you people live?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Honestly I really don&#039;t know many people and have no idea how to safely find good dealers in real life.&nbsp; In the past with the whole bling bling, money is god morality of today I have always had people exaggerate the quality then have the audacity to overcharge me all the while acting like they are my buddy hooking it up.&nbsp; Those people should all have their balls cut off.&nbsp; Drugs are a sacred gift from the gods and dishonest dope dealers must pay for their blasphemy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why people don&#039;t just like to make money and do the right thing by really having a passion for hooking people up and having regular loyal customers.&nbsp; I assume an honest dope dealer lowers his chances of getting snitched on too.&nbsp; I am hoping that the SR is a solution to that problem and that as a community we can self regulate to keep the bad out and promote and reward the good vendors.&nbsp; I have only dealt with one vendor and was very satisfied.&nbsp; That vendor was Litescape.&nbsp; If I had money, the right connections and/or a good place to grow pot and/or the supplies and ablility to make LSD or grow mushrooms, I would sale drugs and be the best, most honest drug guy ever.&nbsp; Sure I would make money, because whether we like it or not, money is a neccessary evil, but I would provide a quality product at a good price, fair to vendor and customer.&nbsp; I love the idea of making a living by spreading joy to the world at fair prices and great customer service skills.&nbsp; YOu would think pot would be easy to get, but for some people it is actually hard to get.&nbsp; I&#039;m not in school anymore and no job or membership in any clubs, so I rarely even get out of the house even now.&nbsp; Bastards that rip people off and the war on drugs that encourages it all contributed to my untreated depression/anxiety/pain and led me to lots of alcohol abuse and benzo abuse while I was homeless and being in and out of jail then punching a cop and doing 9 months in prison, so the drug war and dishonest dopers are two things that really enrage me.&nbsp; Baffling that people can&#039;t just be honest and happily make more money in the long run that way, but lots of people get off on fucking people.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sick world.&nbsp;

				Seriously. Unless you really know the right people or many people who&#039;s experienced in the substances, it&#039;s not only more dangerous but difficult &amp; expensive to get even weed. I&#039;ll be trying out Tommy Chong&#039;s shake/trim so I&#039;ll keep you guys posted on the quality. Communication has been good so far but we&#039;ll see.
