				Because the people running the site decided so.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the best way to reach their objective, but I back them up 100%.<br /><br />Don&#039;t like it? Don&#039;t use SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; Bitching about it isn&#039;t going to fix the problem. Try to be a little more constructive building your count.

				I&#039;m thinking its because it seems like more people than ever are spamming/ trolling just about every single forum. You have virwex.com trying to spam the hell out of the forums and scam people to buy bitcoins from them and the mods just can&#039;t keep up with deleting their accounts/posts. On top of that it seems as though there are more trolls than I have ever seen on here before who just go about posting racist comments to just try and get angry reactions from people. As much as I don&#039;t like this 50 posts thing, it might help the mods keep these people under control and get rid of these&nbsp; accounts before they run rampant all over the forums
