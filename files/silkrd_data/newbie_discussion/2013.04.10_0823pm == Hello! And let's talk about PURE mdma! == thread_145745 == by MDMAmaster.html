				Hello everyone!<br /><br />I was a&nbsp; successful indoor cannabis grower for many years...but I saw the writing on the wall when prices kept spiraling downward. So, because an opportunity presented itself, I started buying supposedly really good Molly by the OZ and selling it to my weed customers when they were going to a concert or music festival. Business was picking up and I was practically doubling my $ each week...but the so called &quot;really good&quot; Molly I was buying and talking up to my own customers just kept getting worse and worse. A few of my friends accused me of ripping them off and selling them sub par bullshit.<br /><br />&nbsp;I wanted to know the truth...so I learned how to truly test for purity (without a NMR)...and I discovered a fairly easy extraction and recrystallization technique that would allow me to know fairly accurately how much real MDMA (+/-10%, I&#039;m guessing), I actually had. 28% it turns out. For every OZ I bought, only about 8 grams out of 28 was actually MDMA. No wonder my customers were pissed. I immediately quit buying that crap, and I told everyone I wouldn&#039;t sell them any more until I knew I&nbsp; could sell them MDMA that was as pure as possible.<br /><br />Thus began my quest to become an MDMA chemist. About two years ago, I finished teaching myself college level OChem (via my girlfriend&#039;s Chem books, by pretending to be in her same class and doing all the assignments she had to do). I wasn&#039;t able to go to any labs though...so I up watching lots of free opencourseware videos on OChem and youtube videos on lab techniques). Today, I know how to make probably the best, purest, and WHITEST, MDMA I&#039;ve ever seen.<br /><br />It does amuse me now, when people talk about &quot;moonrocks&quot; or &quot;tan&quot; MDMA. Pure MDMA salt is completely odorless and is completely &quot;white&quot; when powdered (look up MDMA on wikipedia). If you have creamy or yellow or brown MDMA....my guess is that an HCl gas precipitation (one technique used in a final stage of the chem process), the gas is left in too long, allowing the rest of the solution to react, stain, and contaminate the MDMA. Then, my guess is that the MDMA is only paper filtered out of the discolored solution and is not acetone washed, or melted under lower temperatures (to form chunks of &quot;moon rocks&quot;), improperly recrystallized without the aim of pouring off the contaminants, or all of the above.<br /><br />Now, if we were just talking about DMT, if you see orangy/creamy colored material with the substance, it&#039;s generally because of leftover organic matter (though with proper hexane recrystallization techniques, you can make DMT as crystal clear as glass). A little bit of organic matter isn&#039;t going to kill you (it&#039;s just microparticles of the root bar, in the case of MHRB extraction). BUT...and this is a BIG BUT...MDMA should look pure white (even without recrystallization)...so it worries me greatly that the brown or yellow stuff you&#039;re seeing still has toxic amounts of HCl, or Sulfuric Acid (or some other seriously poisonous shit) in it. And if this is the case (which it almost certainly is), this means the chemist either doesn&#039;t know how to or doesn&#039;t care enough to properly wash his/her batch of even more deadly reagents (like HgCl2 - Mercuric Chloride, a fraction of a gram of which can cause fatal mercury poisoning). <br /><br />So...please do your bodies a favor...and avoid the brown/yellow MDMA! As soon as I get my seller acct set up...I can promise that you&#039;ll only get the pure stuff from me. I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;s going to take me to get up and running (I still have to learn the bitcoin thing)...but in the meantime, please try to buy stuff that at least looks like the chemist TRIED.<br /><br />Yes, there are lots of techniques out there...but any chemist worth their salt...should purify their salts! And MDMA salt cyrstals are clear only (or &quot;white&quot; when powdered).<br /><br />Thank you for listening! I&#039;m excited to for the future!

				I agree bro, I too only sell the best clear white pure MDMA. From the Netherlands. I&#039;m also new on the board and trying to find out the bitcoin thing and how to get buyers for my great product. Hope to do business soon on the board.

				It also may be worth most people&#039;s time to do a wash on a least a sampling of bulk you buy from the road. it&#039;s fairly simple stuff. The MDMA avenger thread in the rumor mill has some links to teks. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if the OP has a good method he prefers for washing? Everyone seems to develop little tricks for it.<br /><br />Also I think the major stopping point for most people making MDMA is less the funding and more securing the precursors safely (atleast in USA). Either way good luck to you! If you ever do get up and running I&#039;ll definitely try you out! It&#039;s nice to hear of a chemist who wants to put out some pure white :)

				I&#039;ve only had average mandy before, but I ordered some Nintendos and good sounding Mandy recently. I&#039;m looking forward to it so much! I&#039;ve heard that the colour of the crystal changes based on the chemist though? Like you can find really good tan crystals every now and again, is that true?

From what I&#039;ve heard, doing the final purge is pretty much an extra step after you&#039;ve already synthesized the MDMA. By purging, you lose a little bit of the product in the purification process, but it ends up being more potent as it is pure MDMA as opposed to MDMA with a bunch of chemical by-products and impurities left in it... <br /><br />This final purification step is what determines whether the crystals will be brown or clear/translucent... with the brown stuff obviously being the MDMA that was NOT purified at the end of the synthesis...<br /><br />Can anyone confirm or debunk this? I hear it repeated on the street often, and it seems like it would make sense but we all know how that goes.<br />

				The molly I have gotten from SR was brown and labeled as &#039;brown sugar.&#039;&nbsp; This was different than any molly I had seen before because I had only seen white molly.<br /><br />Well I took 100mg and it is definitely good molly.&nbsp; A lot of people have written about how their eyeballs twitch back and forth in their sockets when rolling, as if this where a good thing.&nbsp; This also happened to me.&nbsp; What I want to know: is this a symptom of really strong molly or is it perhaps a side effect of something in the molly?<br /><br />I am merely an occasional user, so I haven&#039;t tried that much molly, but I have ordered from another vendor and the molly was still good, but not as strong.&nbsp; This second order was stamped into pill form as well.&nbsp; I prefer the pill form versus the brown sugar (which tastes SO BAD).&nbsp; I have taken 2 of the pill molly and I experienced no eyeball twitching.<br />

				I would be interested in comparing your stuff to the infamous canadian brown sand that was circulating a while back. I know, sloppy synth as you said ... but it&#039;s been by far the cleanest roll I&#039;ve ever had: little body load, lots of euphoria/empathy, and able to sleep like a baby afterward with little to no negative after-affects the next day. Yes, I&#039;ve tried many brands of white/clear stuff but the sand knocked everything before it out of the park. <br /><br />Anyway, update when you&#039;re stuff comes in. I&#039;m definitely up for seeing which comes out on top. <br /><br />@happyhcore - Eye twitching is just a form of body load that comes with taking amphs (along with jaw clenching, increased heart rate, etc.). Less body load and more euphoria is a good thing. If you have no body load and a weaker roll you&#039;re just taking less mdma.

				are test kits that you order online (ex: dance safe) good?<br /><br />Is it more damaging to do pure? I.e. should you wait longer between rolls on pure vs impure MDMA for safety?

				I had a question and instead of spamming the newbie forum until I can ask it in the &#039;grownup&#039; forum, I&#039;ll just ask it here and hopefully contribute more than some of these posters. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been curious about MDMA for a while now and have been wanting to try it out some time with LSD (everything goes better with some lucy :D) and was wondering if I should test-run the MDMA before just by itself, or just throw it all in with the LSD next time I decide to trip? Any advice you guys can give about a MDMA/LSD combo would be appreciated :).

				@wsd23 Try it by itself the first time, if anything to make sure it&#039;s good and also to find out how much you need to get a good roll going (you&#039;ll want to take less when you flip).
