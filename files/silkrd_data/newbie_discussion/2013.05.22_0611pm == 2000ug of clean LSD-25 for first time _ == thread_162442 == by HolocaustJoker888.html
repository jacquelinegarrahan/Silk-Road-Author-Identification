				Don&#039;t. What need would you have to do that much on the FIRST try? Yes, you would waste it and on top of it you would much probably not be capable to handle it at all; you will much probably simply blackout for a lot of time and not remember absolutely nothing and what you will remember you would like you didn&#039;t.<br /><br />This is the worst idea I&#039;ve ever heard in a while and I really cannot understand why this idea came to you at all. What do you think you will obtain by using so much LSD the first time without experience of it at all? Is this some sort of macho approach? If that&#039;s so I can tell you that it&#039;s surely is not the best approach to have with acid, especially at higher doses.

				2,000ug of LSD, hmm, that is scary, I&#039;ve done 1200 before and it was not something I would recommend for everyone. <br /><br />I had a blast though, I saw the threads of reality and was able to bend them around my fingers.&nbsp; I met my spirit guide and we were just about to open a doorway to another dimension.&nbsp; Manipulating the very fabric of reality I was literally opening a doorway to somewhere and slowly being sucked.&nbsp; Right as my hand went through a car drove by and fucked me all up.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Of course later I thought someone was breaking in so I ran around the house with a rifle(realized it wasn&#039;t loaded later) and my back to the wall, checking corner after corner for a shot at the intruders.&nbsp; Turned out what I thought was a person trying to break in, was actually the flashing clock on my microwave, heh.&nbsp; <br /><br />All in all I would never want to take that much again.&nbsp; Doses that high and higher are dangerous and less fun the lower dosages.&nbsp; If want to trip I would stay around 700ug if your looking for a high dose.&nbsp; Anything higher and your into medicine man territory, which means your spiritual adventure may be a one way trip.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t have a a hot tub regulate my temperature and a strong sedative to knock me out if things got too bad then I wouldn&#039;t have attempted it.&nbsp; At the end of the day you should never do that much acid alone but sometimes taking risks is the fun part.<br /><br />

				Please don&#039;t. That&#039;s a TRIP straight to a psychiatric ward.<br /><br />If you are genuinely a first timer and have never taken LSD before then I think you are misunderstanding the nature of that beautiful psychedelic. You won&#039;t get &#039;more&#039; LSD effect that is pleasurable or enlightening, you simply won&#039;t be able to interact with the experience in any meaningful way.<br /><br />If Hendrix had done that amount in one go we wouldn&#039;t have &#039;Purple Haze&#039;, he&#039;d a been in a gurney back to the States with froth coming out his mouth before he could get to the recording studio.<br /><br />There needs to be a bit of you conscious of the trip to experience the other the acid shows you.<br /><br />Bad idea, really.<br /><br />Take care.

				This is a stupid thread by a stupid person. If you are retarded enough to think this is a good idea then I suggest you just go do it to punish yourself for the no doubt countless other retarded things you&#039;ve done in your life.

I don&#039;t think nobody would be so stupid as to believe that just because &quot;nobody read about ODing on LSD&quot; that means that taking 1.5 mg or above it is completely safe and without any repercussion in EVERY case, no matter what.<br /><br />Every medicine becomes poison after a certain threshold and that threshold depends on individual circumstances; psychedelics are not exceptions. The only difference is that in this case the &quot;poison&quot; is more tied to the mind (the unconscious primarily) than the body.

				Please tell me the op was a typo and meant 200ug?!&nbsp; Otherwise you might really stay true to your username.<br /><br />Please do <br />75-150ug for your first time. If you are so intent on having a large dose, first learn how to control the substance before jumping into the deep end.<br /><br />All you have is time... No need to rush things
