				Go out and earn some money and then trade it for BTC?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried the free earnings and trust me, by the time you &quot;earn&quot; enough to use any on SR, it probably won&#039;t even exist anymore. Not worth the time.

				If by earning bitcoins you mean getting them without having to pay for it with $$ than the only thing I have really read about is bitcoin mining. But I think you need a pretty good computer to pull that off decently otherwise you wont really get anything out of it. Or you could just sell products for bitcoins. I&#039;m sure there are other ways too

				- Sell stuff at bitmit.net<br />- Sell stuff HERE (of course)<br />- You can buy a few BTC and then move them to a leveraged speculation site like icbit.se or 1broker.com, of course you can lose there as much as you can win<br />- If you got a not-so-old ATI graphics card in your computer, you can run a miner for some small extras, with your unused computing power<br />

				If you&#039;re male, the fastest way is probably just to buy them from somewhere, it&#039;s not worth the hassle.<br /><br />If you&#039;re female and attractive, the same applies, but you could earn some extra coin by posting sexytime videos and pics of yourself with your btc address in the background or something. This is no guarantee for success so do this at your own risk.
