				Every time i type the correct letters the message appears, its so frustrating especially when you want to review products.<br />You have to repeatedly keep typing the letter&#039;s until eventually after a long time waiting with patience your message gets accepted.<br /><br />Is anyone else having trouble with this??<br /><br />The following error or errors occurred while posting this message:<br />The letters you typed don&#039;t match the letters that were shown in the picture.<br /><br />Even getting this thread through took ages.<br /><br />

				I always had to refresh the page and it would give you new letters, then try again. Anyway after 100 posts you won&#039;t have to do that anymore!

				After &quot;.onion/&quot; in your URL does it say &quot;.to&quot;? If so you&#039;re using a phishing version of the site. I had the same problem and spoke to SR support and they sorted me out.
