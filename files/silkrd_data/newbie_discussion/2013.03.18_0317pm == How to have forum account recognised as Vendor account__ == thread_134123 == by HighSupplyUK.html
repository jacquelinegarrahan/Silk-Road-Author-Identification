				Hey guys,<br />Dunno if the problem is that our vending account over at SR is HighSupply where as our username here is HighSupplyUK - but that was all we could do as HighSupply was annoyingly taken on the forums.<br />We have been vending now for over 2 months and have completed over 200 transactions by the end of this week (probably more).<br />We have a 100% success rate so far and we have never refused to ship to any country- we pride ourselves on our business and running it honestly, fairly and properly.<br />Just because what we do is illegal does not mean it is something to be ashamed about- every time we get a message from a US/Oz client telling us their order arrived perfectly safely, in quick time and are complimented on our methods it really does make the whole thing worth while.<br />We strive to make sure all our clients are happy and so far I think we have been able to achieve this.<br />Because we focus so much of our efforts on messaging our clients, updating listings, preparing orders, shipping etc we do not have much time to promote/build a presence on the forums which is what we are trying to do now.<br />Problem is, we do not know how to make this forum account in to a &quot;SR Vendor&quot; account so we can access the vendor forums and what not.<br />Im sure we more than meet the minimum requirement to join, I will not post our stats publicly but if a mod needs to see how much money through we have per month or alike then please send a PM.<br />Hopefully someone can help.<br />TL;DR - Don&#039;t know how to make HighSupplyUK a &quot;SR Vendor&quot; account on these forums, so we can access vendor forum etc. Think we more than meet requirements. Want to do this so we can start to build a presence on the forums which we have not done up until now.<br />HS

				i think it might be a criterion for the forum username to be identical with your vendor username.<br />best to message one of the forum administrators about this issue!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Vendor_roundtable<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: apparently you need to pm/mail inigo (admin) <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=38344
