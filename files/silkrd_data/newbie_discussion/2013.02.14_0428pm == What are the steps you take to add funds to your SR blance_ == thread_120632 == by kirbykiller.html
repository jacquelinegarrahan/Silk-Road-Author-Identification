				If you would be as kind as to point me in the right direction that would be nice as well.<br /><br />And yes I know of: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer&#039;s_Guide I just don&#039;t know what site to use and what is normally used.

				you could do that through bitinstant, but I would recommend against it. Buying with credit card is much more traceable than buying with cash. Through bitinstant, you could do the cash deposit option and then pay at the moneygram location with a card. Again... I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS METHOD!!!

				https://localbitcoins.com is also a good option. Find a local seller near you. Much more anonymous than using your credit card.<br /><br />Also, even though SR takes some extra steps to obscure the bitcoin trajectory, you may want to use some additional bitcoin mixer, like blockchain.info&#039;s send-anon service.<br />&nbsp;

				If you buy online you usually need to do a bank transfer, use a credit card or paypal, or something along those lines that can be linked to you. I found that buying them locally in cash (though an anonymous bank deposit) felt safest to me.

				I just want a simple thing where I can just buy Bitcoins with my credit card or paypal and simply transfer them to my SR balance.<br /><br />What site is used for this? What steps does one take?

				There are plenty of other threads that can tell you how to use bitcoins; it seems like you need to do some background research. <br /><br />My question is why you would want to do it that way, other than just seeing how close you can come to getting busted.

				Not everything you can buy is explicitly illegal, so I wonder sometimes what the point is too. Some sellers are just paranoid or it&#039;s illegal in their country but not illegal in yours, so they use Tor for really no reason.<br /><br />It does seem like a royal pain in the ass for a shut-in to have to make an extra trip out of their house that year just to add money to a wallet, you know?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Also, honest question -- isn&#039;t the solution for LEA to just make moneygrams/banks deposits/etc infinitely more difficult to use? More IDs taken, more records required, and so on?<br /><br />Thanks and I promise I&#039;m not trying to troll or anything. Just wondered why it was such a pain to get bitcoins myself, saw a thread about it where people were responding in a kind manner, and figured I&#039;d ask some extra questions myself if it&#039;s okay.&nbsp; :)

				Ah, one last question - are sellers usually forgiving about this? Like if you really want something and it&#039;s the last item in stock or something, are there some of them who let you &quot;reserve&quot; it and give a reasonable amount of time to fill your wallet? That&#039;s the main caveat I&#039;m seeing, that it takes a while to add bitcoins so unless you add a whole lot all at once you might not have enough to buy something before it&#039;s gone.

				Some sellers are paranoid online bank transfer is the best though. Paypal noone wants to use because, the customers have the power to claim they did not receive goods. Sellers arent gonna reserve anything timing with bitcoins is the only problem when using cash but nothing else. Only takes a couple of hours from your wallet. There are some people who will do it straight to your Silk Road address as well.
