				Customs is just an excuse.. It&#039;s either scamming or bad stealth that results in your package not arriving. <br /><br />If the stealth is good, it get&#039;s through, simple plain fact. Most OS vendor&#039;s scam Australian&#039;s or just don&#039;t put enough effort into stealth which is just as bad as scamming.

				Still trying to shake off that stereotype of &#039;The Criminal Population&#039; I guess? <br /><br />Just like the English wearing dental braces to make a firm statement of &#039;Our teeth aren&#039;t all that bad!&#039;<br /><br />Or like Muslims traveling naked in an attempt to shout &#039;I&#039;m not wearing a bomb!&#039;<br /><br />Or like the Irish doing an IQ test to say &#039;I&#039;m not stupid!&#039;<br /><br />Or like German citizens going out of their ways to be nice to Jews, so that everybody knows &#039;We don&#039;t hate Jews&#039;!<br /><br />The list could go on.

				Here are some guidelines to ordering if you are in AUS &amp; do not want to be scammed.<br /><br />1. Stay in escrow, &lt;---Most important one.<br />2. Record the unboxing just in case some vendors send rocks.<br />3. Make sure vendors who aren&#039;t located in AUS to have good refund policies. (I offer reship or 50% btc refund if lost in transit, this excludes if the DCN shows &quot;delivered&quot;) Some pesky vendors purposely take advantage of international customers and scent their packages so it gets seized on purpose, thus leading to 20-80% refund of the original price.<br />4. Ask for the tracking if you can get it.<br /><br />Thats about it, but remember to always stay in escrow. Most scams happen when vendors require FE or try to bypass the escrow system.

Customs is customs regardless of country if you are dealing with a Legit Vendor that knows how to correctly package and ship his package with a decoy and multilayer protection as to where if the package was opened it would show nothing but the decoy and be wrapped back up and sent to recipient. I have had about 10-15 consistent packages sent into AUS and no small orders the smallest was two ounces of medicinal grade bud and the most recent of packages is 2oz of High Quality Crystal Meth which we took extreme measures to provide multi-layer protection as well as decoy when shipping a high value product like this we make sure our sender information is very accurate as well as professional business letter packaging with printed labels always! If anyone is needing any of my product delivered to AUS with a 100% guarantee delivery from us as if seized we take the loss and reship free of charge. We would not offer that type of guarantee if we didnt know what we were doing! We are about QUALITY &amp; SERVICE and once you deal with us we know our product will surpass your expectations! Feel free to check out page and listings as well as discussion feedback on profile page and listings! Nothing but QUALITY and GREAT SERVICE when dealing with true professionals!&nbsp; ;D

If you check my feedback as well as my discussion link on my profile I have highly reputable buyers that have spent well over $50,000-$100,000 on SR and ordered from over 50-100 different vendors and you can read there feedback about our QUALITY SERVICE. We have a consistent client buying 2oz of our quality ice every 3-5 days in AUS and he FE&#039;s without even asking as we would allow him to remain in escrow for he is a trusted and loyal customer with us! Most of our customers FE on there own choice as we always provide a very nice bonus/gift for the users who ensure good faith within us in our ability to provide a quality service typically say a user buys 1g of ice and FE&#039;s to show good faith. We not only process, package, and ship same day but we typically give 1.5-1.7 when they were only purchasing a gram. When ordering an ounce or two of ice we typically put it over 3-4 grams on each ounce to show good faith and for them putting there trust in us to do our job! Our feedback and discussion from reputable buyers is more than enough to ensure a loyal customer that we are capable of getting them there package at a reasonable time as well as a satisfactory rate! We are here to provide our service to the SR community we have never wronged anyone and we always fix any mistakes whether it be the customers fault, postal carrier, or our own fault we always resolve the issue and make sure the customer is happy! Hope to hear from some of you LOYAL customers in the future as our listings provide a variety of QUALITY to the SR community at very affordable rates! We are not here to rip anyone off, we are here to build a business and provide QUALITY that will surpass anyone&#039;s expectations when dealing with us! Try us out and you will see how business is suppose to be done friends! Wish you all well!&nbsp; ;)

				UnlimitedLife..I would say your going to get a few more Aussie customers,our money is as good as any. When you look at best selling items, we have quite a few near the top, and that&#039;s paying outrageous prices. A vendor doing it right could sell solely to Australia and make as much if not more than selling domestic. I agree on peroper stealth req, my overseas vendors get my parcels here every time.
