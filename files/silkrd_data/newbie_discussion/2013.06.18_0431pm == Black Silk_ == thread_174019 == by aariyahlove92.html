				So I ran across an item called Black Silk sold by 2hotchicks....just wondering if anyone has ordered from them before and what your results were. Their products really don&#039;t have any reviews and it seems kind of sketchy, but I&#039;m willing to try it if it works. I just don&#039;t feel like wasting my money....so if anybody has any experience with black silk, please let me know !!!!!! Also if you know a trustworthy vendor who sells legit adipex/phentermine!

				Late to the post but I figured you may still be interested - - I took the gamble and ordered a 14 day supply - - after weeks of no show and a SR resolution (reship) I eventually received a 30 day supply (not sure why but whatever).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m on day 3 - - first two days were un-noticable in every way, and my appetite was normal.&nbsp; Today I haven&#039;t had any appetite at all (which is not normal for me) - - BUT I&#039;ve also had this super annoying retching/gag feeling that makes me think I&#039;m about to throw up - - from taking the pill, its lasted about 3 hours so far, with the retching happening every 25-30 min or so.<br /><br />&nbsp; Really annoying, but oddly that is the ONLY thing I notice.&nbsp; My pulse is normal, my BP is slightly higher than normal, I think I feel slight teeth grinding, and my eyes every now and then do that stretchy gaze out into nothing like they do when I&#039;m taking stimulants (like adderrall).&nbsp; <br /><br />No headache thankfully, and no weird heart fluttering either - - but man the gagging thing sucks.&nbsp; I dont even need to throw up, its empty retching and it&#039;s getting in the way of my day-today (couldn&#039;t speak on the phone for long).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve messaged the vendor to ask about the AI.&nbsp; She says she will disclose it after you make an order so I&#039;m hoping she comes through.&nbsp; Want to see what I can do to alleviate this nasty side effect.<br /><br />If you&#039;re still interested I can keep updating here with the results over the next week or so (not going to take for longer than 2 weeks).<br /><br />Cheers.
