				It would most likely be best to ask the vendor this question. If I were to guess it&#039;s because his/her Blue Dream is their highest quality buds and more care = more expensive

				&nbsp;Yeah, I&#039;m still going to buy from him. Can&#039;t beat all the recommendations and 1ups this guy has. I guess I&#039;m paying for the A+++ Stealth shipping too. The peace of mind is worth the few extra dollars to me.

				I plan on ordering 2 blue dreams and seeing if one is significantly better than the other. About 20 bucks price difference between the two, and the other guy goes up to oz. Hoping for my first package in the next day or two, after that, I&#039;ll order one with NCK. If it&#039;s worth 130 a Q, it better be some FIRE, because the other vendor I ordered with has pics and his look like some of the best BD that I&#039;ve seen anywhere.

				Probably because he&#039;s/she&#039;s/it&#039;s one of the most well known US vendors on SR. If you look harder you&#039;ll find as good if not better cannabis elsewhere for less.<br /><br />Sometimes the risk of trying a more obscure vendor is worth it!

				I don&#039;t know the vendor you&#039;re asking about .....but I&#039;ve been in national marketing sales for 32 years<br /><br />i&#039;m a merchant in another area - i sell high end products, most are unique to my company with no competitors carrying those products,&nbsp; but some of my inventory (probably 40-50%) are items common to other companies that sell the same product for 10 to 25% less. My customers still buy from me knowing they are paying more than they would at another company. Reasons: 1) i&#039;m a known quantity and if there&#039;s an issue, they know i&#039;ll be there tomorrow or next week to stand behind the product 2) i&#039;m a known quantity - same reason as last but known as in that they can trust me, if i describe something as x,y,z , what will show up is exactly that<br /><br />someone in my market popped up in one of the collector forums, not too long ago, offering a product that i charged $700, offering it for $399 - i knew what i was paying for it and couldn&#039;t understand how he could sell for that price, he had to be taking a loss. 2nd reason i couldn&#039;t understand his move, was that it was stupid - you want to steal some of my sales, come in at $649, dropping as low as he did was insanely stupid - 2 months later, after 3-4 weeks of internet cheerleaders / groupies (more on this topic down below) describing how great this new vendor was, a few guys popped up asking if anyone had heard from him, as they&#039;d sent $2500 and never received what they&#039;d paid for and couldn&#039;t get an email response or return phone call. All of a sudden about 20-25 more guys chime in, reporting the same experience - some had fallen &quot;in love&quot; with this guy, singing his praises before they&#039;d even received the product and hadn&#039;t said anything, figuring their product was somewhere enroute, etc. When they saw others with the same complaint, they popped up with their stories. In short he was a scammer. Even if he hadn&#039;t been a scammer, he was selling at a loss - how long could he stay in business to support his products he&#039;d already sold?&nbsp; Guy ended up being caught, as he&#039;d scammed too many people out of too much money (the authorities won&#039;t chase a scammer unless there&#039;s a threshold amount of theft involved.<br /><br />point is - when you&#039;re buying something, you might go for the&nbsp; lowest price vendor thinking you are saving whatever amount, but if you don&#039;t receive it or if the product was not as described, then you haven&#039;t saved a dime and you&#039;ll never forget the experience or the frustration of having been screwed. Buying from someone you know you can trust, you might be paying more than you think you should be, but if the product shows up and performs as described and as expected, you&#039;ll forget what you paid<br /><br />so ask yourself, what&#039;s the value of running a risk with an unknown seller and the value of the frustration (and hole in your wallet) if the product doesn&#039;t show up or doesn&#039;t deliver the satisfaction you were expecting. ADD TO THAT THE VALUE OF NEVER FORGETTING WHAT YOU &quot;SAVED&quot;.<br /><br />FWIW<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on the internet in sales, and in forums since the mid 1990s - and have seen a phenomena that i view as some people just needing someone to cheer for or be a groupie for - never understood it, but they&#039;ll have one good deal with a company or a vendor and praise that vendor like he&#039;s baby jesus come back from heaven, with no real basis for their support. I&#039;d love to know the psychology behind their actions

				My opinion on why is prices are so expensive.<br />Well I mean I would do the same thing let me state that.<br /><br />First of you can get the same quality product from a vendor that as just as good as a reputation of him for half that price.<br /><br />He take&#039;s advantage of the fact that he has one of the first listing up when you click the cannabis section. So when new people come to the website and want to order weed his is the first listing they see click his profile and see how well his reputation is. So they order from him.

				&nbsp;Update*<br /><br />&nbsp;Ordered the Blue Dream from NCK. <br /><br />&nbsp;Received the 7grams in the mail today. Looks good, smells amazing. Very very potent the second I pealed away the top of the MBB it hit me like a shit ton of bricks. Will try later.
