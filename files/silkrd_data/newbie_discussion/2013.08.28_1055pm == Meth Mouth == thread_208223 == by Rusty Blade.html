				Do any regular meth users have any advice on how to avoid meth mouth?&nbsp; Is there a method of administration that is less likely to cause it than others?&nbsp; Anything besides an increased frequency in oral hygiene that can slow it down or prevent it altogether?

				I brush and floss while high.<br /><br />If you&#039;re frequently high on meth then you&#039;re going to have more long-term problems than just your teeth of course.<br /><br />Dry mouth probably contributes to meth tooth decay.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if staying hydrated reduces that.&nbsp; It may and staying hydrated is always a good idea.<br /><br />I&#039;ve personally always had a rule that I need to sleep every day but unfortunately I now skip a night of sleep while high about once/month.&nbsp; At least I&#039;m not doing 3 day binges on meth or meph though.

				From my limited use of meth I&#039;d recommend 3 things:<br />1) Brush/floss your teeth normally (twice a day)<br />Most people forget to do this in the depths of a meth binge<br />2) Avoid sugary drinks other than gatorade/powerade, since those are good for electrolyte replacement from all the water you piss out while on meth<br />3 (most important IMO) ) Have a stash of chewing gum on you<br />The worst after effect I got from my early meth use was awful pain in my teeth due to grinding them constantly under the influence of the drug.<br />Once I started chewing gum, the grinding stopped immediately.<br /><br />I highly doubt that meth itself destroys your teeth. It&#039;s just the simple combination of poor hygeine, bad diet, and teeth grinding/clenching that ravages your mouth after a while.

				Good brush of your teeth before and during a session, pipe behind the teeth when smoking, it&#039;s awkward as fuck but have found that the further into your mouth the pipe is the better. quality of gear also makes a diff

				taking magnesium helps with the clenching and grinding, it is a natural muscle relaxant and can buy from most supermarkets in vitamin section. this helps especially if going on a couple of days bender. I used to get real bad (not sure how to describe thi, but go with what my friends used to call it) cheese in the corner of my lips, like a thick white flem, super attractive. The cure for that is a face washer.
