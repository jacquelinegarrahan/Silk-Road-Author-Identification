				There are not many places that will accept credit card payments in exchange for bitcoins because it&#039;s far too easy to reverse credit card payments.

				From what I&#039;ve observed, yeah, you&#039;re not going to get any transfers from your bank card, or CC, or PayPal or other conventional credit-or-debit-based means. The simplest way is basically to sign up with a bitcoin purchasing service (Blockchain and Mt.Gox are good for exchanging currencies but buying them there isn&#039;t really something I&#039;ve been able to see done so far?), and then transfer from there to another wallet or to SR, and just provide a link to a bank account from which to draw funds.<br /><br />It seems a fair amount of people have gotten some use out of Coinbase, a company in SF that handles BTC purchases from USD. Granted, it seems to take about a week for the requested transfer to go through, but that could just be a routing/security/banking issue. (I really need to read up on their FAQ again.)
