				Ok Its time to make my first purchase . <br /><br />I picked my first thing to order. Do I have to input my name when I send a message with my address ? And can I choose friend&#039;s address for security reason ? <br /><br />&nbsp;I will try to send a message to train my pgp skills first , then will proceed to the real order . Any other advice ? <br /><br />Also I noticed that the vendor requested some FE from his current customers , should I FE if requested , it sound risky , but still the guy seems to be fair .

				FE is always a flag, I&#039;m new so wait for some people who know better but I&#039;ve never FE even after ordering multiple times from the same person.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen some vendors say things like, will need you to FE if you have less than so many orders or if you order is over so much I&#039;ll need you to FE ---&nbsp; But I&#039;ve never gone with any of them, let us know how it goes!!

				Hi! You have to enter your address as you would see it on normal mail, so also include your name. You can use a friend&#039;s address with his name on it then, but it&#039;d be better if he agrees to it for obvious reasons. Using a friend&#039;s address is actually better than using your own. <br />You should maybe try to buy an e-book or a lottery so that you get comfortable with how it works, and with the lottery you even have a chance of wining something! Your record will also look slightly better if you have at least 1 transaction and even only $10 spent.<br />And don&#039;t FE.. There are a lot of vendors that don&#039;t require FE for newbs.. I could refer you to some if you can&#039;t find any (it depends on what you want too)
