				Not long ago, there was a bitcoin vendor here who was eventually made a moderator for awhile.&nbsp; Recently, he requested that we delete his account because he stopped selling bitcoins.&nbsp; He is still in communication with a few of us and continues to read the forums daily.<br /><br />It was brought to our attention that after deleting his account for him, someone else has registered the names &quot;CaptainMal&quot; and &quot;Captain Mal&quot; and is claiming to be THE CaptainMal, and PM&#039;ing people asking for their Moneypak codes.<br /><br />The new, FAKE &quot;CaptainMal&quot; has been advertising via unsolicited PM, is a scammer using the name of a reputable vendor in order to trick people, boasts about &quot;his&quot; reputation, has very little (if any) post history, and is attempting to sell bitcoins without having a vendor account (because this new one is a scammer).<br /><br />So, please be aware of this and do NOT attempt to buy bitcoins from ANYONE claiming to be &quot;CaptainMal&quot; -- the real CaptainMal has moved on, and this new imposter is here to scam people by relying on the original CaptainMal&#039;s reputation among the community as a trustworthy vendor.<br /><br />Please report any posts by this imposter immediately, and DO NOT provide him with ANY of your Moneypak (or other payment) information!
