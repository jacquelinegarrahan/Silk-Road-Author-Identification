				<br />1/5<br /><br />Communications: There was no alert to let me know why I could suddenly no longer post in the forums, no private message or anything.<br /><br />Stealth: Overly stealthy, given above. <br /><br />Quality: While this rule may temporarily increase the signal to noise ratio in the forums, in the long run I doubt if it will matter. Spammers gonna spam. Trollers gonna troll. Rockers gonna roll.<br /><br />Remember, never finalize early! Girls hate that.<br /><br />-- Scratch<br />

				Spammers, by their very definition, are more than willing to do a lot of work for a rare reward.<br /><br />Ordinary people are the only casualties.

				It seems like the new rule would just give long time members the chance to circlejerk over their favorite vendors while new buyers have no way of reviewing the daring, new buys they&#039;ve made. Seems to make it harder for other buyers to find helpful reviews. But hey what do I know I&#039;m just a stupid guy that does things.

				I pay hundreds of dollar&#039;s to sell here, and here I am in the newbie section posting messages everywhere so I can get 50 posts lol. I&#039;m not complaining tho, it&#039;s good advertising for me. <br /><br />I agree though, that in the long run this &quot;solution&quot; will not solve anything. But while it&#039;s here, why not chill with some of the newer people on SR and answer any questions they might have, and make them feel welcome. I&#039;m a new vendor but I&#039;ve been a buyer for 6 months and I know my way around.

				It&#039;s just not that big of a deal.&nbsp; Take a deep breath, keep a browser window open for a bit and keep coming back to it while you do other things.<br /><br />People need to chill the fuck out.<br /><br />Keep calm and carry on, and all that jazz.<br />

				It&#039;s really shitty and I don&#039;t really see how it&#039;s gonna keep spammers away.&nbsp; Spammers spam and by this new rule we have to spam to 50 posts which makes us spammers. If anything, it just generated a whole lot of new spammers
