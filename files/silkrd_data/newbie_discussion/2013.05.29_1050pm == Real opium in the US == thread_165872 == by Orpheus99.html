				I would love to get my hands on genuine opium but it seems that all the suppliers are overseas.&nbsp; How often has it been available <br />in the US?&nbsp; I read somewhere that someone in the US was making opium available but a well recommended European SR vendor <br />but I&#039;ve not seen it.

				Well, if BlueViking has been selling it, even if infrequently, then you HAVE seen it, no?&nbsp; Anyway, thanks for the tip, I may write to him and see what he has to say.&nbsp; If any vendor can get it, I think they would do very well and get a lot of new customers.&nbsp; A heads up to vendors, please!

				I just placed an order a couple days ago with DOPE man for us domestic opium.&nbsp; I check the opiates section every day for us domestic opium to pop up and in the last 8 months or so I only saw it one other time and I didn&#039;t have coins and missed out.&nbsp; DOPE man has sold out already but I would imagine he gets more in since his page looks like he is importing international orders and relisting.&nbsp; I will let you know how the opium is once I get it.&nbsp; Hopefully I get it tomorrow. My suggestion to you is to set your preferences to us domestic, then click on opiates first thing every time you log on.&nbsp; You will find it eventually, then just pull the trigger, cause if you wait you will likely miss out like I did 3 or 4 months ago.

				Actually I did see Dope Man&#039;s listing but he carries so many things that I was a little concerned and thought I&#039;d wait to hear reports.&nbsp; I look forward to yours, and really hope it&#039;s good.&nbsp; Somehow I feel more comfortable with BlueViking, to judge by his listings and recommendations.&nbsp; I saw that I had a reply from BlueViking but SR is down at the moment so I wasn&#039;t able to read it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll report back when I do.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I really like about good opium is the &#039;dreams&#039;, which have a mystical quality.&nbsp; I&#039;ve likened it to a kind of &quot;psychedelic Heroin&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d really be interested in a thorough report of what you experience when you get your opium and can try it out.

				I got a reply from BlueViking.&nbsp; The good news is that, according to him, it is some of the best in the world.&nbsp; &quot;It will knock your socks off&quot; is what he said.&nbsp; The bad news is that there has been a delay and he doesn&#039;t know when it will happen.&nbsp; It will also be expensive, but if it is as good as he says, and given its rarity, I&#039;ll want some no matter what it costs (well, within reason!).

				I like your description of O, it has me more excited than before.&nbsp; I have never tried opium, which is one of the reasons I&#039;ve been so militant about keeping an eye out for it.&nbsp; I hope your concerns on DOPE man are not justified, I recently had my first bad experience with an SR vendor the last order I made and do not want another one already.&nbsp; I will update for sure once I get this shit and smoke it up.&nbsp; Does anyone recommend a way of smoking?&nbsp; Would a vaporizer work well?

				I think a vaporizer would work quite well.&nbsp; Just clean off the ash periodically.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve smoked enough, lie down undisturbed.&nbsp; Tune into the pleasurable body sensations and just relax and allow yourself to become absorbed in the pleasure of it.&nbsp; The dreams occur in that space between waking and sleeping.&nbsp; You&#039;re fully conscious yet absorbed in an inner state.&nbsp; I&#039;m really interested in hearing about your experience.

				Hi Redfun,&nbsp; Thanks for the update.&nbsp; I&#039;m replying mostly to keep this thread up front so that I&#039;ll find it when you give your report.&nbsp; <br />Dope Man now has his own thread and I asked him whether he&#039;ll carry opium again.&nbsp; He wrote back that he will, and expects it <br />in about a week.&nbsp; So if you like it, there will be an opportunity for those who follow this thread to buy it.&nbsp;

				IT CAME!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D ;D<br /><br />I won&#039;t be able to try it until Sunday most likely.&nbsp; I plan on using my buddy&#039;s vaporizer.&nbsp; The O is very gooey, looks like the pictures of the Opium the Indian vendors have up, so that may be where it came from if that helps inform anyone.&nbsp; Shipping was sufficient.&nbsp; I think another layer of vac seal would help.&nbsp; Glad DOPE man has a thread now, he has a lot of interesting products and I love the ability to get the international goods I&#039;ve had my eye on from a domestic vendor.&nbsp; I say someone was selling a hash/opium mix in Europe and may try making my own with my next opium order, assuming all goes well with this batch.&nbsp; So stoked I got to pick this up, I have been dreaming of trying opium for YEARS.&nbsp; SR is the shit!

				Hey RedFunGuy, how cool!&nbsp; It has an interesting and unique smell, right?&nbsp; You might put it in the freezer to get it hard before you try to take it out of the packaging.&nbsp; Dope Man posted somewhere that his next batch should be better than this batch, but hopefully this batch will still be good enough to get a decent effect.&nbsp; I think hash or pot will help potentiate the effects of the opium if they aren&#039;t strong enough by their own.&nbsp; And there is always BlueViking&#039;s opium which is due in in the next few weeks.&nbsp; So prospects are looking up for opium in the US.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to your experiment on Sunday and your report.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take care,&nbsp; Orpheus

				Hi YipYap,&nbsp; There are at least two vendors who will be selling in the next few weeks.&nbsp; Dope Man is one, BlueViking is the other.&nbsp; <br />So just keep an eye on the listings, or on the opium threads here, and you should be able to get some.

				Question.&nbsp; I am about 1 hour away from smoking this Opium and I do not have access to the vaporizer anymore.&nbsp; What would you all recommend as the next best method?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any tin foil on hand but I was thinking of using a spoon and a bic lighter and chasing sucking up the smoke with a straw.

				Hmmm.&nbsp; A lot of people recommend the &#039;hot knife&#039; method.&nbsp; You hold one knife over a stove or hot flame and touch the opium (which you can put in a spoon) with it, sucking up the vapor as it arises from the spoon.

				so i smoked some off of tin foil with a straw and ate a little as well.&nbsp; I think it was around 200mg.&nbsp; Hope that wasn&#039;t too much.&nbsp; When I smoked it after taking it out of the freezer it did not melt and run like some people I have read suggested it would, don&#039;t know what that means.&nbsp; Smoke about an hour ago and ate it about 45 minutes ago.&nbsp; Right now just a very calm, stoned like feeling with no anxiety like weed can give me.&nbsp; I figure what I ate did not take affect yet as I took it with 6 slices of pizza.

				Redfunguy,&nbsp; Opium doesn&#039;t run when heated.&nbsp; It just bubbles, releasing a vapor which you inhale.&nbsp; When it is finished it leaves an ash and stops vaporizing.&nbsp; &nbsp;You might try smoking just a little marijuana to potentiate the opium and then lie down.&nbsp; Keep us posted.

				It&#039;s probably not too potent.&nbsp; I think your idea of eating some and smoking some is a good one.&nbsp; You might not be able to smoke enough to get a decent high; a little eaten along with it might help.&nbsp; Definitely leave out the pizza next time!&nbsp; A good dose of opium can cause nausea and the pizza certainly wouldn&#039;t be a good idea for that reason.&nbsp; And make sure you lie down for a while to give the opportunity for dreams.

				I rolled a piece of the opium with some hash and smoked it through a vaporizer.&nbsp; It took a while for the opium to start to smoke and once I hit it a few times I could break up the chunk of opium/hash mix and get really good hits.&nbsp; I loaded some weed after that was getting close to done and added two beers and was completely twisted.&nbsp; My buddy was smoking it with me and we got fucked up off that one ball, probably 100mg.&nbsp; The weed/hash had a lot to do with it obviously, but we could both feel the Opium.

				Ok revised review.&nbsp; I smoked the opium with no hash or weed and it was very mild in effect, not much to write home about.&nbsp; Smoked it out of a high end vaporizer.&nbsp; Decided to eat it on an empty stomach with no weed to cloud the affects.&nbsp; Weighed out right around 300mg, mixed it in with warm water, not too hot, and drank it over the course of about 30 minutes.&nbsp; It&#039;s been an hour since I finished and I am happy with how I feel.&nbsp; I feel like I am on slow motion watching this stanley cup game, heavy eye lids but no tired, a decent amount of euphoria.&nbsp; My conclusion, at least for me, is that eating it works WAY better than smoking.&nbsp; I would buy again, but wouldn&#039;t mind a stronger batch.&nbsp; For the $30 I paid for the gram I am very satisfied.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D
