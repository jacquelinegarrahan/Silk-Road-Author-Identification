				Hi everyone! I&#039;m new to silk road, and I love this forum. I&#039;m making my first 3 cannabis transactions and will have a review when I&#039;m done! The first 2 were great, and new vendors. I&#039;m having a problem with the last one, a very established vendor which I will not name, but they are the top 3% and have about 900 fans.<br /><br />I ordered over 2 weeks ago, and have gone back and forth with PM, here is the transcript.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Me: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I ordered a (product) on thursday night, it was marked in transit around 12 midnight and I FE&#039;d. Its been 7 days and my order has not come in the mail. I&#039;m new to SR so any help you can give me would be awesome. Looking forward to hearing back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 days<br /><br />Vendor: Thank you for letting us know that you have not received you parcels. We have been trying to locate them and we are unable to find them. Please send us your order transaction #, so we are able to verify your order. 9 days<br /><br />(vendor helped me retrieve my FE&#039;d TX#)<br /><br />Vendor: Ok I think i remember now. I do have a package here with a name on it, we couldn&#039;t verify the address and we wanted to know the Name of the city. It was coming up as (city, state) instead of (other city). We want to know if that was it. We did send a message out to the person asking about it and no response came back yet. Since we have figured it out now we can get it to you asap. Thank you for finding the transaction #. 7 days<br /><br />Me: I&#039;ve had no problem with the address as it was printed in the PGP message. Please update when the package is &quot;in transit&quot;. I&#039;m relived it got sorted out thanks for being so professional! I&#039;ll be sure to leave the great feedback! =) 7 days<br /><br />Vendor: Of course we will give you a bonus for all the trouble. Is it ok to use(city state) instead of (city state)? 7 days<br /><br />Me: Yes, I checked google and it shows up as(city, city, and city) so.. kinda weird. (city) looks like it will work though so Its OK. Thanks again!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 days<br /><br />Vendor: OK thank you for checking. We just didn&#039;t want to send it and it was wrong. Thank you again for being understanding and patient. We will get that out to you on Monday. Thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 days<br /><br />Me: Hi! Its me again... I regret to say I still haven&#039;t got my order 4 days after it was shipped from you. How long does it usually take? I&#039;ve received 2 other orders from other vendors within 3 days. Please help! 2 days<br /><br />Vendor: Thank you for getting back to me, I was trying to message you back but I think I sent it to the wrong person. I couldn&#039;t remember your user name. I have been trying to send your parcels for the passed few days. Your address will not validate what so ever. I have tried every city that you have provided. I will get it to you asap with some extras of course. Thank you 2 days</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Since then I resent my info via PGP, and haven&#039;t had a reply in almost 3 days. Any suggestions on&nbsp; my next course of action? This product is not really expensive FYI. Thanks anyone for the advice!<br /><br />

				Give him bad feedback. Drop it down to one see how he likes it. He has your money and feedback is a direct response to your experience with the dude. Message him about it and wait at least a day to actually set it.&nbsp; I see that as a good way to resolution before getting sr involved. But if you FEd, they might not be able to do much, since you waived escrow rights.

				So should I start down the path of threatening&nbsp; editing my feedback / giving them a bad review on here? I just am wondering if this seems like a trail of B.S. to keep me from not doing anything. Or if this just happens a lot? Should I ask for a refund? I just kind of need advice of what to message him after its been a full 3 days and no reply. Thanks!

				That seems fine. Never finalize early. You&#039;re left with no recourse if you get scammed. There&#039;s always a vendor who doesn&#039;t require you to FE. If you get asked to do it, it&#039;s better to take the 10% hit on a cancellation than a 100% hit on a scam.

				Its a domestic US to US vendor, and the reason I didn&#039;t name them is because I think they all may be just really stoned and I respect/understand that. LOL&nbsp; :D<br />Still no response though, although making up excuses for them at this point seems too lenient, I was thinking maybe they are on a pre-420 holiday because they are gonna get busy... who knows. I changed my rating from 5 to 1 with the message above and haven&#039;t heard back yet and my last 3 messages have been unread.. Yet people still are FE&#039;ing so i know they are logging on...

				why did you FE? did he ask you to? if he did is that a policy for all buyers or just for certain stats? <br />in the future i would avoid FE at all costs...even as a newbie you should be able to find a good vendor who will sell to you.&nbsp; if you HAVE to then i would do extensive research into the vendor on forums &amp; make sure he has excellent stats.&nbsp; Ivory is the only person I have FE&#039;d for &amp; he is awesome, for example.<br /><br />since you did FE, if he requires this of everyone &amp; still has good stats maybe you have a shot but otherwise seems like he is not going to send.&nbsp; i don&#039;t understand the repeated mix up issues with your address; if it was right then there should be no reason for him to not send. his messages to you seem like he is trying to appease you so you keep waiting even though he doesnt intend to send &amp; the fact he stopped replying is not looking good.<br />if you don&#039;t know already you can check to see if he has read your messages by going to your messages &amp; to the sent category. it will say read or unread and be bold if they did not read it.&nbsp; if he has read it and ignored that is no good.<br /><br />you seem kind of like me in that you want to see the good in everyone &amp; give them a chance in case it is a simple error &amp; they do fix it but<br />i think giving 1/5 in this case is the only chance you have of rectifying or at least warning others.&nbsp; you can always change to 5/5 and write exactly what happened to you if he does come through.&nbsp; i also think there is nothing wrong with you mentioning who the vendor is in the forums.&nbsp; I would not want to buy from him after hearing your story but if his feedback is good &amp; no negative info on the forum no one will know he is selectively scamming &amp; he will continue to get away with it.&nbsp; again, you could always change what you have written on the forum so that if it is a simple mix up &amp; he does handle it well &amp; you update to reflect that, then that will look good for him. <br />have you searched the forums for anything negative about him? <br /><br />i hope this works out for you! come back &amp; let us know... I&#039;d love to know who the seller is if you are willing to say too. can we do private messages as newbies? maybe send me his name that way &amp; ill see what his profile looks like &amp; forum info &amp; let you know how i feel about him &amp; if i think you will get your stuff, if you want my opinion that is. im a forum newbie but have close to 100 actual purchases &amp; have had my share of issues. good luck man!

				I have searched their vendor name in the forums and have come up with no posts concerning scamming. Only how good the value is for money spent. This is more reason why I&#039;m waiting to identify them. Still no reply, but I managed to see my btc double somehow (and then go back down) and ordered a 1/8 of grape kush from another vendor. I got super lucky!

				You should definitely find out why the vendor had trouble getting your address correct. You can message the other vendors you received packages from and ask if they had any trouble. But I&#039;m guessing you don&#039;t want a lost package floating around in the wrong location with your name on it. Regardless of how well things are packaged they will start to smell after a certain time frame. Obviously its hard for users to help you out since you don&#039;t want to post your address, but it doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s anything related to SR to me. It might have just been a stoned vendor like you said LOL

				Some vendors take weekends off, or can&#039;t always access SR. Patience is a virtue on the weekends. I hope you fixed your score to a 5/5 again. <br /><br />There are plenty of reasons the address won&#039;t verify...you may have entered the zip wrong by 1 number for instance. I would go type your address into the USPS system and see if they verify it as you write it, and if not figure out how to make it verify.
