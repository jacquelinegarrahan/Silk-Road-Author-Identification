				I really only made an account on this forum because I wanted to post in a thread made by a seller of the stuff, as I had a few questions I wanted answered out in the open. I&#039;m considering purchasing some of the stuff, but I&#039;m completely new to all this.<br /><br />There are standard questions I&#039;d ask at the time of purchase, like how secure it&#039;s packed, if it&#039;s going to burst everywhere when I try to open it, what I should use to handle it and redistribute it into other containers, how long before it dissolves it added to a liquid solution, etc.<br /><br />Specifically though, I&#039;d like to know how exaggerated the claims of it&#039;s uses are. The quality that interests me about it is it&#039;s potential use as a truth serum.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the interviews with victims of the stuff, but they couldn&#039;t have been too heavily dosed considering they have partial memories of the events. My question is how reliable would any information gathered from someone on the stuff be? I mean, it&#039;s a hallucinogen, right? What if the information they&#039;re remembering never happened? What if they&#039;re just agreeing/confessing to things as part of the drug&#039;s compliance effect? Some accounts have said with a dose sufficient to make them amnesiac, they&#039;ll also barely be able to talk, yet according to the stories in that Vice documentary, those victims looked and acted completely normal under the influence, and were able to for example, tell their door man not to prevent them from helping the person robbing them move all their stuff out of their apartment, yet have no memory of it.<br /><br />It seems like there&#039;s a lot of room for error here, and it perhaps depends on the purity of it, and what if anything else it&#039;s being used with.<br /><br />Of course, it would also be completely useless in information gathering if the target had a heart attack and died before you even began the questioning.
