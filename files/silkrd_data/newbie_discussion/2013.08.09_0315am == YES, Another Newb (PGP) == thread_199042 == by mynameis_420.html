				It&#039;s easier than you think, once you get the hang of it. <br /><br />Kleopatra works on Linux as well. <br /><br />I copied this from another website: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This tutorial uses GnuPGP4Win.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; GnuPGP Beta Download<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.mediafire.com/?7nd4apb4vt1jdb2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; GnuPGP Download<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.mediafire.com/?ex5zhuud5d7b1r1<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; GnuPGP Setup for Windows<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; GnuPG PGP encryption key setup<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; First! an explanation....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption is always a nice benefit to have because, while everything on tor is usually contained in entirely encrypted flow, if ever for any reason the server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; does get compromised the messages on the server seized are still encrypted and are difficult or unable to be read by any entity without the keys to the encryption.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is where PGP encryption keys are nice. You have a public and a private key that correlate to one another. You hand out the public side of the key, and anyone<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; who wants to send you an encrypted message, can do so using your key. You will then use the private key to decrypt that message, and you can enjoy a little more privacy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in your conversation that would be had without it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Create your master certificate<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Open Kleopatra and then Click File =&gt; New Certificate<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Create a Personal OpenPGP Pair<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Name: use your username for the site<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; email: use anonymous email, or fake@email.addy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Click Advanced<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Select DSA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Check Elgamal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Use highest bits available for encryption<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Click OK<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; f) Click Next<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; g) Use a passphrase you can remember (80+ characters is not unheard of the longer the passphrase the more secure your message will be)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This will take a bit of time....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; h) You can make a backup of your keypair if you want to, so you can import later....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Export your public key<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Under &#039;My certificates&#039; you should now see a listed name (should be your username, if you followed example)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Hilight your certificate, and click export cert at the top, and save this file somewhere (it&#039;ll be a .asc file)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (This file is your public certificate, open it up in notepad or something,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and you can copy/paste this to your profile, or to your customers in a public message.)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Adding Other Peoples Keys:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) People will post their public keys so that you can copy/import them into your key manager (kleopatra in this case)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; keys start with: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; keys end with: -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) To get these keys into kleopatra, select the entire key (including the begin and end line), and copy them to your clipboard (crtl+c or edit=&gt;copy)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Right click your red kleopatra icon in your task bar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) select Clipboard and then certificate import<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Decrypt a message sent from someone<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Again, like the public keys, people will post encrypted messages to you that you&#039;ll need to decrypt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; messages start with: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; messages end with: -----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Again, hilight and copy the entire message block, with the begin and end line<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Right Click the red Kleopatra icon<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Select Clipboard, then click decrypt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Enter the passphrase you used to create your key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The decrypted data is now in your clipboard<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; f) Open notepad or another text editor, and paste the contents of your clipboard (crtl+v , edit=&gt;paste)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5) Encrypt a message to someone else<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a) First you need to make sure you have the public key saved for the person you want to communicate with, in section 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Open notepad, or a text editor, and type the message you want encrypted<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c) hilight the entire message, and copy it to your clipboard<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Right Click Kleopatra , Goto Clipboard , Click on Encrypt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Click Add Recipient<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; f) Goto Other Certificates, and add the individual you would like.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; g) Click Okay/next and it&#039;ll tell you its complete<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; h) The encrypted message is now in your clipboard<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can now paste that encrypted content into a private message to the person with crtl+v/edit=&gt;paste.<br /><br />

				Try PortablePgp. Much more user-friendly than PGP4win or Kleopatra. Not that these aren&#039;t great PGP softwares, I just find PortablePgp the easiest to use/understand.<br /><br />The above tutorial still basically applies.<br /><br />Make sure to give us your public key so we can send you messages, that&#039;s the best way to make sure it&#039;s working.<br /><br />

				Not a problem :) <br /><br />The biggest issue I had using that tutorial is - <br />AFTER you&#039;ve opened the program:<br />In windows, right click on the icon that&#039;s in the bottom right corner of &quot;open programs&quot; - <br />Or in linux use the icon at the top right of the screen. <br /><br />I kept trying to use the desktop icon and stuff that was in the open Window and getting very confused :p

				I have a mac osx 10.7.5 , and the one that worked best for me was: https://gpgtools.org<br /><br />-click on the &quot;download GPG suite&quot;<br /><br />And this is the instructions that helped me fantastically (with an edit of my own):<br /><br />download GPG Keychain Access. <br />Install.<br />Open.<br /><br />Whenever you find a vendor you want to use, copy their Public Key.<br />Create a text document ( I use TextEdit, but any word processor will work)<br />Paste their public key into the word processor.<br />Save.<br />Go to GPG Key Chain Access.<br />Select &quot;Import&quot;<br />Choose the file you just saved with the vendors public key.<br /><br />Now the vendors public key is in your keychain access.<br /><br />Now, whenever you want to send them an encrypted message, open you email client on your mac, select the compose button. (you will not be sending an email, bare with me.)<br /><br />Type your address, or whatever message into the compose email window.<br />Highlight the text and double finger click or right click (whatever your configuration)<br />At the bottom you will see &quot;services&quot;&nbsp; click &quot;OpenPGP: Encrypt selection to new window&quot;<br /><br />(****EDIT, OPEN TEXT EDIT, HIGHLIGHT THE SELECTION, GO TO SERVICES-&gt; ENCRYPT THEN USE THE REST OF THIS...***)<br /><br />Next, you will see a window pop up and you should see the vendor you selected in the window, check the box next to their name.&nbsp; At the bottom you will see a drop down box that says &quot;secret Key&quot; select your account. (If you dont have one you can create one by selecting &quot;New&quot;&nbsp; from GPG KeyChain access and create a new key)<br />&nbsp;then click ok, and then, boom!! Encrypted message. Copy and paste into the vendors address box when you order your product.<br /><br />Thats how i do it. Very easy once you do it once correctly.<br /><br /><br />***You&#039;ll want to untick the &#039;add to recipients&#039; box, I believe this means the recipient won&#039;t be able to decrypt the message unless they have your key saved...Which vendors won&#039;t.***

				What my EDIT section means, is instead of opening your email to do it, you can just go to textedit and type in your address, highlight it, go to &quot;services&quot; and encrypt and then take up on his instructions from there. (starting with check the vendors name).<br />

				PGP is ridiculously easy once you get the hang of it, literally takes all of 30 seconds after you mess around with it for a few minutes. I use Kleopatra, but I&#039;ll spare posting another guide since several have done that already. It&#039;s too easy to encrypt your address NOT to, especially with how much protection it provides if things go south.

				I use pgptools but reading a well written tutorial on gpg4usb really helped me figure it out - the principles are the same mostly. You start by generating your own key (new, passphrase, mash the keyboard while it&#039;s generating etc etc). <br /><br />The basic principle - for me to send you an encrypted message, I need to encrypt it using your public key (hence the vendors post them on their profiles). Then you are able to decrypt it using your own key. <br /><br />If I want you to reply to me, encrypted, then I must also give you my public key. You then encrypt the message for me using my public key, so I can decrypt it later. <br /><br />Experiment with it a bit, it soon becomes clearer having appeared horrendously confusing to begin with. <br /><br />Re Textedit, the PGP commands did not automatically appear in my right click / services menu to begin with. I had to manually enter them via system preferences / keyboard.&nbsp; <br /><br />Visit the PGP Club thread and import some addresses, play around with it. Also look out for signatures - slightly different, they are used to verify messages eg DPR usually signs his. Not many others use this function - it confused me a bit at first. <br /><br />When you copy and paste a PGP key or message, make sure you take the whole thing including the ---- at the start and end of the message. <br /><br />Also you don&#039;t have to attach an e-mail to your PGP, it&#039;s optional. <br /><br />That&#039;s the stuff I found helpful starting out. I&#039;m still learning though and I&#039;m tired and error prone so if any of that is wrong please correct me. <br /><br />The only thing that confused me initially was finding my own public key. But if I follow the instructions, save it to an ASCII file then open that using textedit it appears. I&#039;m not entirely sure that is the simplest or only way to bring it up - perhaps someone more knowledgable could advise. <br /><br />Also, silly question but I guess you can encrypt a key? So if I send a message and include my public key, I can encrypt the whole thing with someone elses key and send it to them? I struggle to wrap my head round that, like back to the future or the concept of infinity. My head hurts just thinking about it. <br /><br />
