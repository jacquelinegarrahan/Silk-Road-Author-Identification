				Don&#039;t spend money that you cannot afford to lose/for starters. <br /><br />The thing about FE is that as a noob there may be something you really want but only one seller, they can seem legit or have prices that make them an option for you and they require you to FE. Once that is done you really have no recourse other than sharing your experience on the forum.<br /><br />I used FE as requested by BusinessAsAlways for three 10mg IR Opana and then he turned out to be too stupid to manage his business and never sent me anything. He seemed legit based on his feedback but in the end told me it was my own fault for FE&#039;ing even though he told me he required it. <br /><br />Have you ever been burned in real life? At least on here all you lose is some money. The people that will rip you off here aren&#039;t going to decide they need to beat you half to death to get your money.

Just do not share any personal information or information about the packing, unless it is vague and doesn&#039;t give anything away that would be useful. That&#039;s pretty much the biggest nono there is. I believe the post earlier in this thread had links to threads about that, as well as his recommended sellers. If you are browsing SR, most vendors will have a link to their review thread on here. You can also just search their name.

				Scurvy does mention you need 3 previous transactions to buy, and if the order doesn&#039;t make it a 50% refund OR a reship. <br /><br />If that&#039;s the route you want to go, there are tons of vendors offering cheap digital product to get your transactions, and also get a feel for how everything works.

				Use common sense. Find a few sellers who don&#039;t mind using the regular escrow policy with new buyers and buy a few things from those type of sellers to establish a little history. After that the reviews pretty much tell it all. It&#039;s a beautiful system. Sellers can&#039;t just go around ripping people off left and right, it doesn&#039;t work like that.
