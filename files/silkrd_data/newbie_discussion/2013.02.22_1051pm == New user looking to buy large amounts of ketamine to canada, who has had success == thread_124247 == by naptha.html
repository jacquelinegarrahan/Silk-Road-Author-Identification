				as subject says.. i am new to silk road, frankly, my IRL suppliers of ketamine just can&#039;t get the kind of ketamine i want, and are charging extreme rates these days, so i&#039;m looking for a new avenue.. i&#039;m wondering if anyone has any tips as to which vendor has success in shipping large amounts to canadian addresses.. i want to start with a small order of 28gr (an ounce) and work my way up over a couple months to ordering half kilos or full kilos every month or two so i can phase out my current suppliers..<br /><br />can anyone point me in the right direction?

				Since you are a new user your buyers stats are not buffed up enough. You will not be trusted among the vendor community. Especially if you are trying to purchase an ounce for your first couple orders. They may require you to pay before they send it and in that case they can scam you and SR support will not be able to address it. Start small or purchase a bunch of electronic data listings to get like 5 purchases. Then start looking for those large amounts. Try to order domestically as well to avoid an FE from international orders. A lot of times they require an FE even if you have spent 20k and had 0% refund or autofinalize rates. Read through the feedback from potential vendors you will use. Make sure people are receiving products from that vendor. So look back a week or 2. Any questions feel free to ask. I do not have much experience with K on the road, so, I cannot recommend anyone
