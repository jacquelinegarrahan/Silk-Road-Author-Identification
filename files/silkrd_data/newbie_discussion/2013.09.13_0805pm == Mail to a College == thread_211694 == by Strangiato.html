				So I&#039;m living in a dorm in a college and don&#039;t have my own place. Would it be alright if I was just sending small amount of psychedelics (not marijuana) for personal use to the on campus mailboxes? Just trying to be extra precautious here, the mail people seem to be not overly interested in their jobs so I imagine it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to get it sent there.

				as long as they dont check your mail or open it themselves,<br /><br />ive been in the hospital (of course totally different situation) but theyre the nurse staff has to open all mail and check that no one is sending any contraband to the hospital for the patients,,<br /><br />but if you just have like a p.o. box at your dorm then that should be cool, just order small stuff, like in little padded envelopes, just not big stuff in priority boxes cause idk what they would do with those,,,<br /><br />im sure youll be alright&nbsp; ;)

				If you have a mailbox the safest option would be to order something that fits in that so you don&#039;t have to sign for it. Getting kicked of college for ordering something would not be fun.

				Wouldn&#039;t the rules regarding mail be the same in college as anywhere else? Mail is protected from search without a warrant, isn&#039;t it???
