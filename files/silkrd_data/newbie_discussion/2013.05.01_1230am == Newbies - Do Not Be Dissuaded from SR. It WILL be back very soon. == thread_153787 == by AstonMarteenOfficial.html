				Just thought I&#039;d do my part and tell the newbies coming here for the first time.. this is a shitty time indeed to have stepped into the world of Silk Road. But you know what? There have been shitty times before and many of us old hats have seen Silk Road triump over EVERYTHING that&#039;s been thrown its way. EVERYTHING. <br />This site, Dread Pirate Roberts, vendors, buyers, forum community.. everyone is resilient and this place fucking ROCKS. <br />Don&#039;t think that because the site is having some issues that all the hype about Silk Road was wrong. It wasn&#039;t wrong. You&#039;re here for a reason.<br />Several vendors including myself are running operations on a case by case basis via the forum and tormail and have NOT ran off to other sites that have yet to prove themselves the way Silk Road has.<br /><br />Stay strong, be patient, and be creative. Where theres a will theres a way.<br /><br />AM

				Fairly new to SR, but I&#039;ve had a number of packages and all but one came with 48 hours.&nbsp; Just a shame its down now!&nbsp; Need some hash for mayday weekend.&nbsp; Sure I can travel by train to pick up hash, but SR makes it so easy!<br /><br />I&#039;m going to stick with SR, just hope the DPR get it sorted soon, must be so frustrating and time consuming.

				i poked my nose around Atlantis the other day. seems super sketchy to me.&nbsp; No domestic vendors, very strangely low prices. smells like scams.&nbsp; The silkroad is the best place to do business.&nbsp; Not only does it have the quantity of vendors but also the quality.&nbsp; And if you are questioning, you can get answers from a thorough forum
