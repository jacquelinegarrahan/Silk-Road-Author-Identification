				Weed is actually more expensive for me locally, and I wouldn&#039;t even know where to find an ounce of organic medical strains in my area.&nbsp; I, and many others, are not social butterflies.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the awkward experience of hanging out with&nbsp; a quasi-friend dealer, with whom I wouldn&#039;t otherwise hang out.&nbsp; So yea, that&#039;s why..

				Honestly, I was thinking about picking up an oz of some special stuff for special occaisions, but other than that, I agree with you, I&#039;ve got a great local source with reasonable rates.<br /><br />An ounce of White Widow to take to Electric Forest would be pretty sweet though, kinda hard to find that around here...

				Interesting to note that many of the local dealers have exactly the same weed that&#039;s available on SR, and have even mentioned having to wait for a new supply to arrive in the mail and such. In other words, they&#039;re buying the shit on SR themselves, then selling it at a profit. So no, not cheaper to get it from a local dealer, but safer? Hard to say.

				Some people don&#039;t smoke regularly and just want to smoke it on some occassions, and might not know a good dealer. On SR you almost always get good quality if you look around carefully.

				Locally we can purchase just normal English homegrown for Â£160/oz which is alright, but then if you wanted to buy some nicer strains the price clocks up a lot and for most people I know they can be quite hard to find. SR provides us with a nice selection, and when you scan through and find the best stuff for the best price its an invaluable resource.

				I live close to where a lot of the really good weed is grown.&nbsp; But still chose to buy from silk road. <br /><br />I prefer to not have to deal with anyone local who may know who I am.&nbsp; <br />

				The risk buying in the street from some muggy dealer plus getting involved to circles, i would usually not even been seen with. Also cannabis is used as a medication(yeah we all do, in so many different ways) and since i am lining in europe but had to move from one country to another, just was also getting tired of the &quot;meet and greet&quot; with people who don&#039;t even think a little like myself.

				There&#039;s actually plenty of value to be had on here; particularly if one is prepared to buy larger quantities internationally.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/efb8f317f2<br /><br />^ see that listing, for example.<br /><br />Additionally, hardly any local dealers will be able to compete with the selection available on SR.<br /><br />The vendor rating and review system on here also means that one can buy with reasonable confidence in the quality and consistency of the product. Far too many times IRL have I bought weed and found it to be a long way short of the weight and standard I was expecting.

				Does anyone smoke the trimmings?&nbsp; i see that vendors sell a good amount of trimmings.&nbsp; Ive heard it could get harsh... is that true?

				i think there&#039;s more tar or something in trimmings so its more unhealthy to smoke but don&#039;t quote me on that. most sellers recommend extracting the active compounds for edibles or oils. it can be really great value though if you&#039;re into that sort of thing.

				I&#039;ve bought weed one time domestically. Wouldn&#039;t dare to order internationally. It&#039;s more convenient for me to buy it from a local dealer.
