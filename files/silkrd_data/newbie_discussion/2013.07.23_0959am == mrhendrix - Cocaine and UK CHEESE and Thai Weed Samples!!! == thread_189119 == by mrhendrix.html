				Just bumping up the post to stop the spam from btc scammers!<br /><br />Also, good to see more UK vendors with some coke - would be nice to see a couple of EZ test results for active cuts and purity levels for any new vendor of the yayo. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m bored in work. Nothing to do really apart from look out the window, so thought I&#039;d look at SR instead.

				Hi guys thanks for the look. EZ test pictures should be up within the next week or so to validate the A-1 Claim. In regards to the steepness, we are still trading within 3% of general street value.(United Kingdom) There are cheaper listings on SR but my guess is its severely stepped on/cut hence their low prices. However we aim to please so we shall get the Test results up and see where we go from there.<br /><br />Happy Shopping!<br /><br />mrhendrix&nbsp;

				Thank you guys for the dialogue. We have put our heads together and decided since we are nearing the end of the month we will be lowering the price of our A-1 Cocaine samples to under Â£18 for 0.2g:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a1273fad04<br /><br />Our price for the 1g listing has also been lowered:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c9c9aa4f8d<br /><br />We have also decided to extend our sample promotion on Thai weed:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2de5cb004d<br /><br />Still the best Thai weed in strength and price on SR<br /><br />Happy Shopping!<br /><br />mrhendrix<br />

				Several orders have been placed and filled now, but I have only tried the Thai so far. As a supplier of quality goods and such pleasant, professional manner,&nbsp; I would highly recommend mrhendrix to anyone looking for some good value, nice Thai.<br /><br />Communication: They are very polite and professional which makes things pleasant to resolve and inquire about rather than a chore like some sellers. Descriptions were accurate, and info was always supplied when requested. They respond within a couple of hours usually which is great.<br /><br />Packaging: For domestic the packaging I received was very thorough. I won&#039;t go into detail but I will say I don&#039;t see this getting intercepted. Sometimes with the Thai there is a little bit of the inner packaging stuck in the heat sealed edge of that layer but I do not see this as an issue for most people. <br /><br />Delivery times: Even after I had an issue and had to change my delivery address, the orders are always in transit 24-48hours after my order is placed. Often will arrive faster than other things I have ordered from other people at the same time. Dispatch days are displayed on their profile so you can plan your schedule which is nice for people like me who travel a lot.<br /><br />Product: The weights I have had were all either comfortably on or nicely over and usually over. The appearance and smell are exactly what I expect from Thai and are nostalgic for me personally. Somewhat spicy and tangy. Some little gold string to be removed as you would expect. Sometimes you get maybe one seed or two, but for Thai this is expected. Leafy buds of dark, sticky plant which I advise grinding because you may not realise how far each one goes. When smoking it tastes just like Thai should, sort of subtle compared to something like hash or skunk, but reminiscent of the smell. The high can creep up on you sometimes and is very enjoyably positive and uplifting. A cerebral kind of buzzed high which is good for social smoking and artistic stuff like drawing and playing music. Relief of aches and pains reported from my friend who has a knee injury, which is a bonus for some.<br /><br />Overall: Great stuff, and I&#039;m buying it pretty regularly now as part of my usual &#039;&#039;shopping&#039;&#039;. Recommend sometimes mixing it with other smoke as the buzz of the high works well to counteract sleepiness from skunk etc. If their other products are as high quality as this stuff, I can see mrhendrix rocking on for a&nbsp; long time to come.<br />Cheers.

				Spent a weekend with the in-laws at a festival and this mans products got me through! the thai is deceptively strong for its appearance but was still able to blaze like fuck without getting the fear that i get from skunk.<br />Got a sample of the the charlie also and thoroghly enjoyed it: smooth as fuck on the nose, no stinging or ridiculous numbing that i have come to expect from the cut to fuck shit you get on street these days just a nice clean high.<br />also can not fault stealth or delivery times, i made my first SR purchase with hendrix and the professionality of the service convinced me the whole thing was worth looking into!
