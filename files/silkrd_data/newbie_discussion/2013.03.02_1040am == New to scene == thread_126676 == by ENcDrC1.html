				Hey everyone, just wanted to drop in and introduce myself. I am a cannabis connoisseur and a Kratom user for anxiety. I have a green thumb and I love growing cannabis for medicinal use. I have done amphetamines in pharmaceutical form and they were awesome, besides that I have never done any real hard drugs. I tried coke once but it was like 25% lol.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have been checking out SR for a few weeks now and I&#039;m hoping to purchasing soon. I understand the whole concept of bitcoins and how they work but not sure where the best place would be. I&#039;ve been looking at coinbase and was curious if anyone had any info on how reputable they are.<br /><br />Also for PGP encrption, what is a good program for doing that? I had one a while back ago but forgot the name of it since my harddrive last crashed.<br /><br />Any tips for a newcomer are always welcome. Thanks and I hope to get to know some people here soon!

				hi,<br />if you are running windows, gpg4win would serve you well i think<br />there is a good picture tutorial here:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html <br /><br />can&#039;t say anything about coinbase as i&#039;m not from the us, <br />but i often heard the tip of routing your bitcoins through one or two additional wallets before sending them to silkroad, to further obscure the trail<br />(don&#039;t know if that is truly necessary though)<br />useful services for that would be the following:<br /><br />https://instawallet.org<br />https://easywallet.org<br />https://blockchain.info/wallet<br /><br /><br /><br />hope that helps<br />

				I&#039;ve been using coinbase for a little while now and I&#039;m quite pleased with them. There was one little hiccup where my transaction didn&#039;t enter the blockchain for a little over a day. They finally sorted it out. Since then things have gone smooth.

				Welcome, and have fun buying drugs easily over the internet.<br />Be careful not to be scammed, and i recommend you try MDMA/Ecstasy, not many health defects just like cannabis. <br />Plus it&#039;s a great anti-depressant, so you can use it for medical use ;)
