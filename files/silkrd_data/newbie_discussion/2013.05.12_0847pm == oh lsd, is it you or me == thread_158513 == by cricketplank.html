				I&#039;ve eaten lsd about 4 times in my life, two nights ago being the first time for about 10 years. unfortunately, I had another shitty experience, just like the others.<br />the first hour was grand and i was walking around outside not worried, smoking a little and relaxing into it, then all this massive anxiety started coming up, huge fears and i just had to watch it all. the rest of the night was my body actually in pain and paralysed with terror.<br />thank god for sleep bringing me through layer by layer, but i know that this was the wrong time to eat it, and that i made a lot of silly mistakes.<br />in any case, i&#039;m starting to think if lsd is just not going to work with me<br />i had reeeally bad diuretic effects (i seriously lost water, peeing liters and not drinking huge amounts at all) and my mouth was incredibly dry for the whole night while i was trying to get to sleep<br />all in all i think i took too much for a beginner (180ug) and i made setting mistakes as mentioned, but still, I wonder if its just something that will never agree with me? i don&#039;t understand how people have such happy trips when mine are so filled with terror and pain<br />

				i ate one of mahakala&#039;s 180ug. it was lovely at first but several things went wrong to teach me some harsh lessons. i think half of this would have been right for me.<br /><br />the terror was related to having things to do tomorrow and regret of having decided to take so much, because the effects lasted so long, and my body was contorted with pain without the ability to keep attention so that i could observe the roots of the pain, it was just lots and lots of pain<br /><br />we need time and space and no worries and no people to judge us

				May be it was just too much for you? Did you eat mashies before?<br />I&#039;m on 200 microgr hofman+ 35 local mashies, and feeling great! A bit scary sometimes :)) but you just should try and forget all problems and errands for tomorrow.&nbsp; Disolve in present works better when getting fears.. what do you think&nbsp; peeps?

				Yes this was clearly the beginning of the unpleasant descent. i do look at it, however, as having reached a fundamental terror which rules many elements of my life, and i know that over time this is my work to clear this. however regarding lsd, i won&#039;t take it again until i know i can be completely comfortable and unfortunately, that is not the current stream of my life as i have lots of responsibilities

				sweetpoison, i&#039;ve only eaten mushrooms a couple of times but i&#039;ve drank ayahuasca many times with a shaman present. the mushrooms once resulted in a terror trip also, but with ayahuasca i&#039;ve always been able to go deep into fear and horrible sickness, but without the type of paralysis i have had with the others. i use these things usually to see within and to help me life, but part of the means maintaining consciousness through the trip, which i wasn&#039;t able to do this time. again, probably the wrong time for me to do this, cause i needed to learn this lesson about my fears

				Sweetpoison, any advices for first time LSD users? Also, link us to a great LSD vendor as well. I&#039;m really interested in doing a Candyflip. Would you recommend a Candyflip on a first time use of LSD?<br /><br />I would love to know the precautions of LSD and I wanna have the &#039;experience&#039;.

				2 cricketplank - if you decided this way then it&#039;s probably right... if you get into so much fear with it....<br />I remember myself, about 15 years ago i was getting fears being on mashies ( i find them harder then lsd ).....but alright with them now...<br />So... you probably just not ready for it yet... like i wasn&#039;t for mashies until now<br />2 GFX4DRUGS -&nbsp; i bought from fredthebaker about 1 month ago,&nbsp; &nbsp;just didn&#039;t have time to test it. Mashies- picked myself on season. <br />YOU are right, cricketplank, music is important!

				Sweetpoison, i once did a week of meditation and it was quite similar where i went into big fears, but at least then you can get up and walk around easier. you&#039;re right though, this isn&#039;t the right time to be working with new things by myself as i have too much going on in my daily life. i think when things are cooler in my life i will have the opportunity to meet LSD face to face, and we can talk things over then. thanks for the chat

				I believe my music playlist is fine. I do only play Progressive House most of the time since I&#039;m a regular ecstasy user. So progressive stuff makes me reach my peak. Also, I do a little DJing in a club. So yeah. If music plays a big role, I think I got that covered. Unless I have to play Psychedelic kind of music which is not really my style.

				If I ever had a bad trip I used to lie in bed and listen to ABBA. Assuming you had real LSD, I would say it&#039;s you and not the drug. Psychedelics open up your subconscious anxieties, insecurities and self-esteem, so if you have a few issues it&#039;s likely to fuck you up. A safe environment, and not coming into contact with people I was uncomfortable with were the biggest factors for me. I had some good and bad trips. Personally, I got fed up of psychologically torturing myself, so I prefer MDMA these days

				that&#039;s interesting Tobias, I have had great experiences with good mdma which were far from torturous, but it&#039;s not the type of thing i see myself sitting down with, but who knows?<br /><br />Full_Escrow_UK i haven&#039;t smoked DMT but i am interested having worked with ayahuasca. they say ayahuasca vine is the real healer, while the leaf which includes the DMT is like the light that you bring into the cave. people with more experience need less light to see in the cave. i also believe that there are great benefits to working with a whole plant brew with all the various alkaloids and co-factors, rather than smoking a pure derivative - however everything is different, and i think i will smoke it at some point (p.s. i would not take ayahuasca recreationally)

				I only took MDMA on my own once, and while it was nice enough, I had a great urge to be with people, and at the time, I couldn&#039;t be, so it was a bit frustrating. On the other hand, with LSD, it got to the point where I could only take it on my own, when I had a completely controlled environment so nothing &#039;external&#039; could go wrong, phone off the hook etc.. I did have some amazing experiences tripping out to music. For me, it tends to go wrong if I have things to worry about. I&#039;m an anxiety sufferer, so I have to be careful. Funnily enough, my best trips were at Glastonbury festival back in the day. There was so much crazy shit going and you were kind of cut off from real life anyway so nothing really mattered. I think that &#039;nothing really matters&#039;, happy-go-lucky mindset is kind of what you need for a good trip.

				When this happens I just sit down and count my breaths, just some simple meditation. I usually slow down my rate of breathing, go to something like 1-2-3-4 repeat. You might want to close your eyes, or focus them on something. Like others have said calm or happy music is good too, and you can combine that with this. Try it all out and find what helps YOU the most.
