				Hey guys... Why is no one making and selling THC acetate? I dunno bout you, but if it were offered as a product for sale, even for something absurd like $250/G, I&#039;d totally try a gram.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar, THC Acetate is made from the same process that turn morphine into heroin. It has been reportedly seen by the DEA and turns up in their writings, and other sources have written about yielding it and some of it&#039;s effects. Reportedly 1.5-2x as potent as it&#039;s hash oil counterpart, and is reportedly much more psychedellic as well.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I have limited if any knowledge of chemistry... however, from what I understand, you just fucking boil hash oil in acetic acid. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a bit more complicated than that, and I understand it probably takes a somewhat well equipped lab with a competent chemist all the same, but I just though with all the people and all their resources on here, and all the hash oil offered as a starting product, SOMEONE would have taken the initiative and offered it, even if they offered it at $250 a gram.<br /><br />I get that it&#039;s a lot easier to get and sell pot, and I get that there is enough demand for pot that basically everyone takes the lazy way out and sells it... but I&#039;m even thinking like largescale production of e-vape pens stocked with thc acetate... i believe it is actually an odorless substance, which would make it perfect for the people who are on here specifically for the anonymity.<br /><br />Please, intarwebs... come thru with that shit. I&#039;d like to smoke some.
