				Hello all. We would like to join your community, as we have much to offer the visitors of SR. We are a group of tech-literate professionals with over a decade of online and real-world retail success. We are well-informed and are equipped with business necessities a professional SR vendor should: PGP, above-average stealth techniques, etc.<br /><br />However, we&#039;re having trouble with the process of obtaining BTC and are confused as to how we would convert to cash at the end of the day.<br /><br />We&#039;ve spent weeks endlessly digging through forums and can not find clear, concise instructions on how to proceed. With the myriad of BTC scams out there, we have trepidation investing before we are sure that we are able to convert our BTC to cash safely.<br /><br />Could someone please fill us in on how to obtain BTC without jumping through countless hoops, and more importantly, how to convert BTC to cash?<br /><br />We would be more than happy to compensate with free product samples.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Bitfloor is really a great website for this kind of thing. You can very actively trade bitcoin to usd, and usd to bitcoin. You can also send bitcoin to a wallet, it&#039;s how I get my bitcoin. It gives you a wallet, so you can send the btc you receive from SR transactions to your bitfloor account, and very simply trade it to USD. Check it out if you haven&#039;t already, and feel free to shoot me a message with any questions. <br />-Poison

				Try the bitcoin message board. Lots of great people there. I would suggest finding someone to interact with face to face. there is the buylocalbitcoins site that can facilitate that process. The bitcoin otc site also offers a ranking system for sellers and buyers. I am in the process of handling it this way. I am not a vendor, but maybe we could pool our resources to find a good route to go. I am in the us. <br />respect.

				Heres the addys for the sites I mentioned. <br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/ this is an irc channel. <br /><br />I have no experience with the mentioned bitfloor, and i have been recommended to use Campbx. Most of the exchanges that are any good, at least in the us, require a verification process that is a bit intrusive. Thats the hard part it seems. Once you get setup with an exchange, conversion to cash is easy, it just leaves a major trail. Thats why I suggest finding a reputable &quot;dealer&quot; to buy and sell with. Also, although you probably already have, read up on the possible dangers of selling bitcoins too. Seems like that would be easy, but you have to watch out for reversible payment options. There are lots of people out there looking to buy bitcoins. Using wire transfer or cash in the mail sounds like the best way to go. Again, if you haven&#039;t already, definitely go to the bitcoin talk forum. Troves of quality info. But, they are supported by MtGox, so you&#039;ll get lots of recommends to use them. They are a solid exchange, seem like the best imo, but I wont use them because of the verification process and the fact they are located in Japan-additional fees. Lastly, I think the verification may not be enforced on smaller amounts, but im not sure.

				I would recommend one of the BTC traders on the site. You can PM me on site for my personal recommendation but all of these(listed) have been around for a while, while nothing is 100% I feel comfortable doing business with any below. .&nbsp; they all have reviews and proven track records.&nbsp; If you need more direct assistance feel free to PM me or use Torchat or Tor-Irc <br />You need to ask yourself how much anonymity do you want.&nbsp; For 100% i recommend Moneypak or inbank deposits(they require no id) If you do not mind losing some anonymity then bitinstant would work<br /><br />Vice City Bank - you can western union or give him a moneypak from walmart, converts to BTC at 10%, Converts BTC to cash for 8-10%<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2343ffa65c<br /><br />Blue Sky Traders - make a deposit at your local Bank of America, not sure of the rate, but very competitive.&nbsp; They were within 10% last I checked.&nbsp; Does not Convert BTC to Cash<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22441.0<br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />SugarMama - Takes Moneypaks at fees based on how much the MP is, 10-20%, Exchanges BTC(yours) to Moneypak(theirs) for little to no fee last i checked<br />Cant find link, too lazy to search, Sorry Mama<br /><br />Freemoney100.&nbsp; Takes Moneypak at fees based on amount exchanged, varies 10-40%<br />Cant find link, too lazy to search, Sorry Free.<br /><br />You could also use Bitinstant and pay thru moneygram, then xfer to a wallet then to SR.<br /><br />DO NOT TRADE BTC &amp; MONEYPAK to anyone WITHOUT A REPUTATION, even then there is a risk. But considerably less then a new user.&nbsp; Research them, check past transactions, review threads(most have them) Do moneypaks in $300 amounts staggered.&nbsp; Moneypaks are not accepted above $500 so if you were exchanging $3000, dont give 6 $500 moneypaks at once. Do Multiple transactions to cover your bet(no offense if these are things you already know)(10 x $300 or 6 x $500, one MP at a time). Same with BTC to Moneypak.&nbsp; Keep it at or under 1k at a time.&nbsp; Exchanging 5000$ is tempting(to scam) for even the most proven vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Blue Sky Trading had exchange at 5-8% depending what time you were looking at numbers.&nbsp; Felt the need to put that it was under 10%<br />

				I&#039;ve found this website useful for cashing out bitcoins:<br />https://fastcash4bitcoins.com/<br /><br />also, i don&#039;t endorse writing about SR on clearnet, but there are a couple easy guides to buying BTC on the silkroad subreddit.&nbsp; Just look at the sidebar for links to those guides.&nbsp; The service you choose should depend on the level of anonymity you want (which should be high as a vendor!)<br />http://reddit.com/r/SilkRoad<br /><br />good luck and welcome to the road!<br /><br />

				If you wish I could get on torchat and discuss a few options with you. There are ways to get btc that is very trusted by pretty much everyone buying/selling them that i can discuss as well as provide links to reviews etc. If you want to chat with me pm me your torchat id and a good time to chat.

				I am an established vendor who has never bought a coin from a clearning house.&nbsp; I only deal with individuals.&nbsp; I cash out via moneypack or reloadit cards. I can vouch for both freemoney and sugar mama I&#039;ve used both with success many times.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to have to give any personal information of leave any trail.&nbsp; I just knew one guy who had coins to start with.&nbsp; I use to be a clearnet RC vendor so I also always offered all my products and 10-15% off for coins and traded product to this one guy for coins.&nbsp; Got my first coin when they where like 7$ per.&nbsp; I mostly saved them all until I could afford a vendor account as soon as I had that I got my ass off clearnet and the saftey of tor and sr.&nbsp; Gave away a few samples and did my best to offer the top customer service and very soon getting coins was no problem.&nbsp; Now have picked up a second account and will start selling my own coins to people at market value exchange rate if I have problems with mp for coins vendors not paying out fast enough I&#039;ll take the matter into my own hands.&nbsp; Feel free to drop me a line if you need more starting out advise.&nbsp; The other thing I advise you do is hurry up and get your 50 posts don&#039;t wait till you established and popular only to find yourself unable to take part in your own review threads started by your customers.

				If you cash out a lot through fastcash you are asking to get nicked in the end. They DO keep records and are USA based so they have to roll over if the pigs come a knocking. Cashing out in general is rough unless you know what you are doing. Our methods are massively elaborate and notice we say METHODS. You have to use multiple cash out options with different amounts of give and take for the sake of getting your mitts on cold hard cash. Get creative and search around and you will figure out how to do it.

				Just an idea; you could sell BTC for MoneyPak reload/Moneygram/Western Union on SR.&nbsp; This would allow you to cash out your BTC, and assist buyers with obtaining BTC quickly with cash.<br />&nbsp;
