				I am contemplating ordering from a vendor that states on his profile, that if you FE, you are eligible for 75% refunds from him and if you dont, you are only eligible for 25% refunds<br /><br />There is also another part stating that there is a maximum of $500 for refunds<br /><br />The seller in question has a proven, albeit relatively small, track record of delivering what he says he will. For that reason, as of yet, the sellers legitimacy isn&#039;t in question in my mind and I dont want to discuss anything regarding opinions or theories on this practice<br /><br />What id like to know is, if I did order from him and the order didn&#039;t arrive, for whatever reason, and the transaction was progressed to SR escrow staff... Would they do as they always do, take a neutral view and decide upon the facts presented, stick to their set rules and then come to a decision?<br /><br />Or would they allow the vendors stipulated rules regarding refunds to take over, and refund according to those?
