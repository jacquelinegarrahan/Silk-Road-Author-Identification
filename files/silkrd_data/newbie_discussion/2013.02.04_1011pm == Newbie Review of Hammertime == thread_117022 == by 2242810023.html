				I know there is an official review thread for Hammertime but since I am new to the forums, but not to SR, I figured I would post my review here, because I think this vendor deserves to get as much good words written about him as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve ordered multiple times, and have always had a fantastic experience.<br /><br />&nbsp; 1) Communication: (5 / 5) Communication is key when dealing through an anonymous forum, and Hammertime&#039;s communication is fantastic. He responds promptly, is polite yet to the point and never bullshits. On my first order I totally screwed up the GPG/PGP and he quickly responded and requested the appropriate information so he could get my shipment out as quickly as possible. He also answers any questions you may have and is clear and concise.<br /><br />&nbsp;2) Shipping: (5/5) Includes expedited shipping into the price of his products, which many vendors do not do. In addition, he has a great method of protecting your shipment from both prying eyes, and noses! I have ordered many items from the road, and rarely see product as well protected during shipping.<br /><br />&nbsp;3) Pricing: (5/5) For a seller with a rating as high as he has, his prices are consistently below market value. Couple this with the fact that he includes expedited shipping into the price of the product, it really makes purchasing easy. I never have to worry about over depositing to cover unexpected shipping costs.<br /><br />&nbsp;4) Product: (5/5) I have never been disappointed by either his product or how it is packaged, It is always exactly what you order and packaged in a way to not arouse suspicion. I am a mainliner and after prepping am left with a crystal clear product with no gunk, debris or garbage left in my solution. It&#039;s potent, it&#039;s clean and I have never received a better product locally or on the market. <br /><br />The fact that I am posting this review is proof enough that I think people should know about how great this vendor is. Give him a shot, you won&#039;t be disappointed.
