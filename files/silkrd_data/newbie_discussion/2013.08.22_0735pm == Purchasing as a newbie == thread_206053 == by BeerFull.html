				Ignore this lottery crap.&nbsp; Your buyer stats will show how much money you&#039;ve spend as well as the number of transactions.&nbsp; The vast majority of vendors will do business with someone who hasn&#039;t done a single transaction.&nbsp; Many will not ask you to finalize early.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been asked to finalize early...unless something truly shitty happens leave 5/5 feedback as soon as you get your order...if you have negative stats that&#039;s when you&#039;ll really have a hard time getting sellers to accept your order.&nbsp; I&#039;d be more concerned about finding the vendor that YOU are comfortable with.&nbsp; Look closely at the feedback regarding shipping time, stealth and product quality; as well as the seller overall stats on their page.

				Excuse my shameless plug. <br /><br />All vendors aren&#039;t created equally and the best advise really is to go with the vendor you feel most comfortable with.&nbsp; When I was a newb with no purchasing history I had no problem making purchases, most vendors just stipulated certain terms, such as no refunds or reships for low stats.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck
