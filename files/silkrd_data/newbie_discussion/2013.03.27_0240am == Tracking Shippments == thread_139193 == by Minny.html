				I thought I should post this under shipping, but that forum isn&#039;t accepting new posts. I also tried searching for a post like this and couldn&#039;t find one. Tor is soooo slow, I time out constantly.<br /><br />Anyway, I put in my first order on Sun night. It was noted as in process until finally today it was shipped. I know that&#039;s not long, but I&#039;m a bit anxious. My order shows in transit but I can&#039;t find any other information. How do I know when I&#039;ll receive it? Many people mention tracking #&#039;s in their posts, but where do you get them from? I&#039;ve checked my email and messages on silk road and nothing. How can I find this? Is it only certain vendors that provide it? I used pill city and some of the comments mentioned tracking #&#039;s??? Thanks for any response!

				It is up to the vendors if they supply a tracking number or not.<br /><br />In the event that you do get one i would advise against using tor to check just to be on the safe side.<br /><br />Just wait untill a couple of days if its over due then inquire about a tracking number. Checking every 15 min wont make it arrive any quicker.

				A tracking number isn&#039;t going to make your package arrive. If it goes missing don&#039;t go to UPS/FedEx/USPS etc. If you bought from a reputable seller you have nothing to worry about. If you didn&#039;t buy from a reputable seller, you just learned a lesson the hard way.

				Thanks for the input! I&#039;m having a hard time figuring out this site, and I&#039;m in computers, lol. They talk about tracking numbers and FAQs and the only thing I can find is the blog, orders and messages. How do I send the vendor a message, if the package doesn&#039;t arrive. I was burned once on a non silk road vendor and I guess I&#039;m paranoid. At least I made it a small order, just in case.

				On the vendors profile there is a button under their name &#039;send a message&#039; to contact them if you need to. wait an extra day or two if it was only sent out today though.<br />Not every order posted to you will have tracking, it depends on the type of postage choice. Most vendors will describe the mailing options in their profile or listing and whether or not it comes with a tracking number.
