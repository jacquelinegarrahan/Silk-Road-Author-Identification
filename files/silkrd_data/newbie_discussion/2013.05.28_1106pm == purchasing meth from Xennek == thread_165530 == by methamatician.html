				As a few of the &quot;larger vendors &quot; seem to be to busy to reply to either messages or process orders,not to mention inflated prices and others simply wont send to Australia,i was considering buying from xennek.<br />Has anyone had any previous experiences buying meth from this vendor?<br />Was the product any good?

				You need to do a search for this vendor. Also try reading in the meth review thread. I know you can not post in the thread but you can read it any way and learn a great deal about who&#039;s who and what is what with these vendors. Personally I would go with CrystalShip. Great communication and excellent gear. Go check it out, also the best stealth you will find.

				I ordered 1g of the medical grade snow white weed and it was a perfect transaction. He did not put it in transit for close to 2 days then it arrived 1 day later. I can not speak about his meth since i have never done meth let alone his but his weed is awesome and it was an A+ smooth transaction. I would definitely order from him again.

				I know AmericaOnDrugs ships to Australia but they do require FE for international.&nbsp; I have dealt with them (domestic) three times now and they have been an absolute joy to deal with in every way, I highly recommend them; the stealth I receive for domestic US seems like it would likely be sufficient for customs but I wouldn&#039;t doubt that they have something else up their sleeve for their Aussie orders.<br /><br />Good luck, I know things are tough down there these days!

Only managed to get 1grams worth of it down here and cos Aussies love meth and breaking bad,the shit just flew out the door.It wasn&#039;t the best stuff out there but far from the worst,about your &quot;SR&quot; average i reckon.<br />No idea how i got so much negative karma,i reckon most of it would be coming from my first ever post.Cant remember exactly what it was called but it was a meth vendor review that i did based on my experiences of purchases from meth vendors.Looking back it was a really shit post but it was my first and i thought it was pretty legit when i did it.Look it up and tell me what you think.<br />Cheers to all of you that took the time out to read and reply to this post.

				I&#039;ve had success with Xennek shipping meth to Aus. Awful stealth, too. (Just shows how dodgy our customs really are.) Most meth dealers rip me off. Xennek&#039;s gram was alright, waiting on an 8-ball now.
