				fuking hell&nbsp; &nbsp; :o<br /><br />&quot;I sell Customer information, we all big vendors M***** and *** (big sellers) all buy each other details.&nbsp; this why the other company had also the same information. Ill explain suppose Mr A has a deadline for the orders she has linted time to move all the hot stuff about quickly. the last&nbsp; any top vendor is going to ant is stuff which is payed for but is simply lying about. so using this information she can then find the correct address and send it right away without waiting fir the clients reposes.&nbsp; But the man principles of this is it can be used for marketing the right goods for the right target audience. It makes market segmentation so much more easier to understand., See these as M****l reports but also including consumer exact demographics. However this is now my intellectual Property.&nbsp; when this is passed on we all know who buy what and who scams who. so when they scammed someone else ***&nbsp; know they don&#039;t even bother sending as we think they are most likely to do the same.&nbsp; there more then about 20 i think which are strong contributors.&nbsp; can you tell **** he owes for the last report. on January please.<br /><br />folk on here&nbsp; know exactly what I mean&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; :-X

				Its strange this &#039;message&#039; you received appears to read uncannily similar to many of your other posts.<br /><br />None make any sense. <br /><br />I have many transactions with the said vendor and all have been fast and excellent hash.&nbsp; Also I am now a fan of another vendor you have banded around and look forward to trying his weed soon thanks to your threads. <br /><br />

Again, a very shitty thing to do that must violate some rule. And you know who buys which products frequently, but that isn&#039;t really a big deal. (btw &quot;intellectual property&quot; is a legal concept, which doesn&#039;t really fit into an illegal market.)<br /><br />there are also up to 20 sr vendors who communicate, and if one can&#039;t fill an order, he will ask another vendor in this network to ship it out. They will do this without asking the client.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">there more then about 20 i think which are strong contributors.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At least 20 vendors do this.

Maybe this is just going over my head. If so, please tell me. If english isn&#039;t your first language, then I hope this criticism isn&#039;t constructive. But for the love of god, what did you even say there?? Read your post and tell me if it even makes sense to you.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: just realized &quot;grass&quot; is the name of the vendor, after searching on sr. Thought you were talking about weed in general :P . So that mystery is solved; how about deciphering the rest?
