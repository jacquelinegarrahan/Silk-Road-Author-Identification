				As far as I know, this is not a current feature on the site. How is it done?<br /><br />Seems sort of foolish, given the nature of the site, that one can&#039;t erase any trace of his/her being here. Even if you are anonymous, I see no reason to not be able to delete your account and free up some server space.

				Are you asking about accounts on the main SR site itself, or forum accounts?

Most vendors are also employing security measures such as hidden encrypted volumes etc. thus negating the need for things to be deleted.<br /><br />If a vendor were able to delete their accounts on a whim, what would stop them from switching to FE then scamming and suddenly deleting their account, disappearing without a trace? :-\<br /><br />I have been a Mod since May 03, 2013, 12:32 am, but have been a member since late 2011.<br /><br />Libertas

				Yep, that&#039;s why I was asking ... on the forums, you can go through and delete your posts one by one and then delete your account ... you&#039;d have left no record other than in any posts where you&#039;ve been quoted.&nbsp; On the main site though, the message history, account history, etc. all needs to be kept in case of possible issues.&nbsp; Also, as Libertas noted, if people could simply delete their SR accounts, the amount of scamming would increase exponentially!
