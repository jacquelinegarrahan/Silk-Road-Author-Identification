				I can&#039;t afford to party.&nbsp; I just did the math.&nbsp; I lost $55 dollars on those transactions.&nbsp; I&#039;m basically paying for the positive feedback and familiarizing myself with stealthy shipping methods.&nbsp; I have to admit, I&#039;m feeling pretty good about my methods.&nbsp; People are gonna laugh at the packaging for the samples.

				Found ya! Good work getting started here on the forums. Remember to start a new thread in the rumor mill area once you reach 50 posts! There&#039;s much more traffic there and also much less spam. When you get to 100 posts, you&#039;ll be able to give out karma AND you&#039;ll get rid of those annoying captchas. The forums are a great way to get feedback from your customers, announce deals/sales, sneak peak new product menus, etc.. <br /><br />Now, I was wondering, could I sample your bud AND your honeycomb? I&#039;m happy to pay, just thought I&#039;d ask for a custom listing here in case anyone else was also curious in trying both. Maybe a gram of the Sour Diesel and a half gram of the honeycomb? <br /><br />Also, do you have any intentions to offer bulk listings in the future?<br /><br />Thanks for the help and good luck on the road!

				lol easy stealth put product in a ziplock back put that in a vac bag then use MMB on the outside keep sealing area 100% clean of drugs wash hands wear gloves to avoid finger prints / residue. cut open a stuffed animal put shit inside animal glue animal back together. insert packing peanuts. express ship that shit to reduce time in post office. Good enough for international shipping just dont get sloppy with your packing and youll be fine fine fine

You&#039;d need to create a new listing for this combo package and then link it to me either privately or post it on your vendor page for all to see and have a chance to try. Thanks again!

				Just received my sample of Sour D.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my review!<br />-Communication: The vendor messaged me not long after placing my order to let me know he received it, and to tell me it was shipped and the expected shipping date.&nbsp; It was a nice gesture that I appreciated.<br />-Shipping: I ordered Thursday, it arrived Saturday.&nbsp; Very professional.<br />-Stealth: 2 vacuum seals, plus more I won&#039;t reveal.&nbsp; More than adequate, especially for just a sample.

				I placed an order for a quarter of the Sour D. 4me2kn0w was very prompt in responding to my messages from the beginning, and he informed me of when he sent out my package, as well as the estimated arrival date. I received the package in two days. The packaging was&nbsp; very good..multiple vacuum seals and a color barrier. The product itself was excellent--frosty, beautifully manicured nugs that gave me a nice clear sativa high. The weight was right on point also, with the free gram included. Top-notch service from 4me2kn0w.

				Hello,<br /><br />I would like to Vouch for this New Vendor.<br /><br />***I ordered a Ounce of Sour Diesel + 2grams= $237<br /><br />1. I ordered my product on Friday, <br />the vendor mailed it on Saturday, and I received my product on Wednesday.<br />Fast shipping, from Coast to Coast.<br /><br />2. He Double Vacuumed sealed the bag. <br />Then he also had Vacuumed Sealed Mylar bag over that, too.<br />Threw in extra items to disguise the weight also...<br />So fantastic job!<br /><br />3. Ordered Ounce and 2 grams. Got the weight on the dot. Great job.<br /><br />The bud is Fire, and stinky, kinda smell like Silver Haze, very good smell.<br />Many trichomes crystals over it, and great color.<br /><br />4. Great and fast communication, and a very nice guy to talk too.<br /><br />Awesome Bud!<br />Awesome Vendor!<br />Awesome Business!<br /><br />Thank You 420!!!<br /><br />I will be back for sure....<br /><br />ED approved :)<br /><br />
