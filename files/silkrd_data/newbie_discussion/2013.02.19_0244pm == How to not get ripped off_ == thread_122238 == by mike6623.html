				I am gearing up for my 1st purchase, and considering the anonymity of the site, I was wondering about how to NOT get ripped off for money. I mean, this isn&#039;t ebay, and if I pay for something, someone can simply take the money and run, no? Anyone have this happen before?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				And ignore the SPAM posts selling cheap BTCs!!! Only purchase them through respected and reviewed traders like Blue Sky Traders, Bitinstant etc. Search for them on the forums and if you don&#039;t find multiple good reviews from respected posters keep well away! If it&#039;s too good to be true.......

				Read everything you can on the vendor before you buy, also send them a message and see how long it takes for a reply and the tone of the reply. Dont ask a stupid question though and don&#039;t ask one that is in their FAQ. Be polite.

What do you do as a noob? It seems like we would be an easy target for selective scamming in this case, however also a chance to do a leap of faith if you will.<br /><br />suggestions? US MDMA vendors that actually sell MDMA, not methylone? lol

				@cantellya Empathy101 is a LuckyLuciano reseller in the US. Simple as that. Sells up to 10g I believe<br /><br />as far as not getting scammed, MaidMandy is right. Don&#039;t FE and you should be fine. Escrow is in place for a reason....

				I know this is off this topic, but I cannot find the &quot;start thread&quot; button haha.<br /><br />I have a question about EMS shipping. I am trying to get ephedrine for my girlfriend so she can lose weight. the seller is in india and only does EMS which requires signature, which scares me. Has anyone experienced EMS shipping? How was it? I am nervous because there were a few sites from canada I ordered ephedrine through, but was refunded right after saying they dont ship to the US any more. I doubt that would flag me, but I really want this deal and it is EMS signature ONLY. Advice? Experience?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				Skip ephedrine, clenbuterol is much more effective.
