				Some questions for those who live (or have lived) in Spain:<br /><br />1. If a person spends a week or two in Spain, and order blotters (LSD, Nbome...) to his hotel, what are the chances the letter will either be seized by the police, or does not arrive at all? Let&#039;s assume the seller is 100% reliable. <br />2. If ordering to hotel is a bad idea, are better alternatives available for receiving mail?<br />3. If one is caught with 2000-5000 hits of Nbome in Spain, how long prison sentence are we looking at?<br /><br />Ordering stuff by mail to my own country is unfortunately out of question. Muchas gracias for your input.

				Bumping cause this needs to be answered.<br />Never been to Spain, don&#039;t know much about it, but I did spend a good while in Italy. Hotels there would have no problem hanging onto a letter for you. I&#039;d like to think Spain is pretty similar. And if anybody was going to seize it, surely it would be customs? I don&#039;t know how the police would be any the wiser, and I assume there&#039;s plausible deniability especially in a hotel. It could have been for the previous tenant, or a different room, for example.<br /><br />As for legality and penalty for possession, Google is your friend there. <br /><br />I really think you&#039;ll be ok as long as it&#039;s reasonably stealthy and clears customs. But again, I don&#039;t know a thing about Spain, so this is all speculation. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will see this.

				Thanks for your input, Tommytucka.<br /><br />The mail in question would both be sent and received in Spain, so no border crossing there. I&#039;d like to know whether in Spain they are x-raying domestic mail, or having dogs sniffing it. Also, how reliable is the postal service in general? Doing a test run myself (with a very small amount) is one possibility, though from here it costs both real money and time.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been able to find anything solid regarding Spain &amp; Nbome or LSD. There&#039;s a wealth of information about cannabis, though. I know Spain has decriminalized personal use, but if 2000-5000 hits are found with me at the airport or the border, that surely must constitute a serious crime. Even though my country (a Northern one) has semi-fascist customs/police system, the penalties are relatively lenient.

				Made another push to google things. Found this: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5174EN.html?pluginMethod=eldd.countryprofiles&amp;country=ES#c4&nbsp; It is good stuff, though still too general and nothing about -Nbome.&nbsp; I would still appreciate info on the Spanish domestic mail. Also, are there alternatives to receiving mail at one&#039;s hotel? Maybe some anonymous postal boxes for short-time rent?

				Some more underinformed ramblings (and a bump):<br /><br />You&#039;re in an iffy spot, if you ask me. From what I found, it&#039;s legal in EU*, but I don&#039;t know if Spain has its own domestic laws. Since it&#039;s domestic shipping, I&#039;d normally say just go for it. I doubt they scan mail too intensely, and I don&#039;t think dogs are trained to smell -nbome. Even if they were, hopefully the order would be vacuum sealed and harder for them to get to. And since it&#039;s going to a hotel, there shouldn&#039;t be anything to worry about. Yeah, I&#039;d say go for it man. BUT....<br /><br />... and this is a big BUT&nbsp; (literally :P), the amount you&#039;re talking about is obviously wayyy more than personal use and could get you into serious trouble for trafficking or intent to sell if caught (going by my country&#039;s laws, which I&#039;m guessing have their analogous counterparts in Spain as well as most developed nations.<br /><br />In sum, don&#039;t over-think it, or do. I can&#039;t imagine much risk of getting caught, but in the off chance that the worst should happen, you&#039;re probably in for a world of pain, or not. It might be legal, or at least unscheduled. Honestly though, this doesn&#039;t sound one bit riskier than ordering the same product from SR to your house (safer, if anything, since it&#039;ll be domestic).<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve ordered a few highly illegal orders from Spain to my country and haven&#039;t hit a snag yet. Do you have know of any Spanish vendors? might be worth sending a message on SR<br /><br /><br /><br />Somebody get a Spaniard in here!<br /><br /><br />*http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=25I-NBOMe

				Seriously? no one else has anything to say on this yet? Yo taklamakanakanl, I&#039;m invested in this thread now. I have to know the answers, even though they&#039;re completely irrelevant to me lol. Get your post count up man, and maybe another forum will have more to say

				Thanks again, Tommytucka. No need to be invested in this thread, as you have already contributed a lot.<br /><br />One possible solution is to receive the mail to my hotel, and immediately send it to my own country by mail. Surely it sounds like it does not make any sense, but at least I get total control as to how the stuff is packaged. I can take suitable packaging materials with me etc... And if the shipment gets caught by the customs, my situation is still better than if I had been caught with the stuff in my suitcase. I found out Spanish penalties for trafficking are really tough, but it might apply mainly for larger criminal gangs and resale of really harmful drugs.<br /><br />One further possibility is to buy a fake ID, and rent a place in a country near me. Really, not far away, and with relatively cheap prices. Within a few months I could take many shipments with very low risk, even set up a camera thing to alarm me in case the police visits the place. The only hurdle is getting that ID, but I&#039;m looking into that as well.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m over-analyzing. I will do one way or another, after my old mom&#039;s birthday next month...

That&#039;s a perfectly acceptable risk, and I must act before the time window closes. I&#039;d rather import LSD, but need a better setup before that.

				Haha I mean I&#039;m invested because I&#039;m genuinely curious to hear the answer. I travel a lot, so knowing laws in other countries is useful, not to mention interesting to me. <br /><br />So wait, nbome isn&#039;t scheduled in your country after all? does that mean you can just get it sent there without going to Spain after all?

I don&#039;t know if it corresponds to the system we have here.<br /><br />What I know is that if I order Nbome, there is a reasonable risk the customs will seize the letter. I will get some kind of fine (no prison, though). A house search and confiscation of my computer is possible. I will end up with criminal record, and that will harm me in many ways. It will come up in background checks when applying for jobs. And it will harm me if I want to smuggle/sell drugs. I would rather import LSD, but with the quantities I&#039;m talking about, I would get a prison sentence. Nbome is not yet considered an illegal drug, but we&#039;re getting there. For example, Bromo-Dragonfly is already an illegal drug here, every bit as illegal as LSD. Anyway, for what I&#039;ve learned, Nbome is an acceptable risk, so I&#039;ve made up my mind.<br /><br />Long time ago I ordered a mushroom kit from the Netherlands. It was legal, as it did not contain growing fungi, but spores and growing media separately. It was opened in the customs, but came through. Anyway, they put me into some kind of list, and for many years I had to get my foreign shipments from the customs. Not always, but occasionally. You have to open the package in their presence etc. Luckily it happens no more, but I want to stay in good books with them.
