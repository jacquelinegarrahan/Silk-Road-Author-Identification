				Placed my first few orders on SR and Im a bit confused:<br /><br />Two vendors (Dagga Couple &amp; BashfulBetty) shipped out extremely quick, within 24 hours.<br /><br />I ordered from two other vendors and one of them, let&#039;s call him for now Vendor A, changed the status to &quot;in Transit&quot; after 2 days. The same day I sent him a message asking if that means that he actually dispatched it, but no reply since then.<br /><br />The other vendor, says he dispatched the order (also 2 days after), but the status is still &quot;processing&quot;.<br /><br />So I&#039;m obviously spoiled by Ebay where pretty much everyone ships within 24 hours, but how long does it usually take vendors on SR to dispatch an order?

				Depends on the vendor I ordered 3 items yesterday night&nbsp; two are dispatched already.<br /><br />Longest I have waited was seven days to dispatch&nbsp; but he had some personal problems and gave me extras.

				So do you give 5/5 feedback when someone dispatches several later (and let&#039;s say doesn&#039;t apologize or give extras)?

				That&#039;s something you have to decide yourself. 4/5 is not that bad, and clearly shows everything went mostly ok.

				Yea that makes sense, but so what&#039;s the norm? What&#039;s the max. time it should take a vendor to dispatch and reply to messages to be considered a &quot;good&quot; vendor?

				Just remember you are buying drugs on the internet. These people are doing you a great service. If it takes a few days to dispatch it&#039;s probably because they are very busy, a lot of vendors get swamped with customers very quickly as their products start to gain momentum and their reputation builds. This is not ASOS or eBay, this is Silk Road! Have some patience and communicate with the vendor if anything seems to be amiss. It usually takes 3-5 days for my shit to arrive and that&#039;s within the same continent, not intercontinental postage. Remember if you are buying from the other side of the world it can take weeks.

				Yea for sure, Evrae.<br />But even 3-5 days domestic, means that they dispatched within 24-48h...

				Sometimes vendors can take a few days. Usually there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot;.&nbsp; There is considerably more involved in SR transactions than there is on ebay. If you&#039;re feeling impatient it&#039;s better to communicate with them than to jump to conclusions or give poor feedback.

				OP, <br /><br />For me, it would depend on what the vendor publicized on their vendor profile.<br /><br />If they operate within the timelines that they have advertised, then I would give them a 4 or above.<br /><br />I would not personally expect freebies for slightly slower delivery.<br /><br />You are still receiving great substances through the mail. This is awesome and worth appreciating :)

				It goes by the vendor, they are all different. You have to read their complete vendor page B4 ordering from them. Some state they will ship with x amount of hours or x amount of days.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t live up to their promise, AND , they don&#039;t communicate and explain why, then you have reason to get pissed. There is no &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; timeframe. These are all different businesses with different methods of operating .

				Thanks everyone for the suggestions.<br /><br />I def appreciate the services offered and I&#039;m also more or less patient ;) <br /><br />It&#039;s just that I saw some vendors dispatching my order within 24 hours, but another one other taking several days to get it out. In that time he also didn&#039;t communicate and once he did, he was extremely unfriendly, telling me I should stop harassing him (all I did was send him two friendly messages asking if he has dispatched my order yet).<br /><br />Anyways, I feel like those vendors that dispatch within 24 hours deserve a better rating than the slow vendor. Since I can&#039;t give them 6 out of 5 ;) giving the slow one 4 out of 5 is more fair to everyone.

				so as long as your gear arrives you all give 5/5<br />so like eBay then when everyone throws a fit if they get less than 100% feedback making the rating system a bit pointless!<br />I was wonering this too, so will play along.<br /><br />Does giving a vendor less than 5/5 affect your buyer rating, or do you just get a transaction count and nothing more?

So it just counts as a transaction.<br /><br />From what I understood, some vendors are asking to have buyer&#039;s rating implemented. Right now, they only use a blacklist for scammers.

				thanks<br />so it is just than 1 vendor you upset if you give less than 5/5 as they are the only one that will see it; so i guess it depends if you want to use them again as to whether you drop to a 4/5 (so harsh!)

				New member here so take my advice with a grain of salt... but it&#039;s not all that uncommon for legal online purchases to take awhile to process.&nbsp; And those sites aren&#039;t even exposing themselves to any level of risk.&nbsp; Delays happen, sometimes it&#039;s just the way people handle their business.&nbsp; I totally get where you&#039;re coming from that vendors with super fast shipping and amazing customer service should get the highest ratings, and certainly agree when it comes to sites likes amazon, ebay and etsy.<br /><br />But on SR, there&#039;s a ton of risk for both buyers and vendors and I think it&#039;s fair to expect some delays after making a purchase.&nbsp; Either one of them could get charges filed against them unless the vendor stays on the top of their game.&nbsp; To me, the ratings system is a way for buyers to get a better idea which vendors are the most trusted rather than those that give the most amazing customer service, since trust is everything here.&nbsp; With that said, it&#039;s awesome to see vendors making daily updates, having the time to answer the plethora of PMs they get, making good on mishaps with their customers.. things that make for great customer service.&nbsp; I just think that trust is the bottom line rather than customer service, and in that respect any vendor that gives updates and/or ships within a week deserves a 5.<br /><br />TL;DR- n00b doesn&#039;t think a week&#039;s delay should drop the rating to a 4 if the vendor came through.
