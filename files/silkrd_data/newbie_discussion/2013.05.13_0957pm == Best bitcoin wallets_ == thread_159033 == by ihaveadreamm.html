				Hey guys,<br /><br />I want my bitcoins to go through a wallet before I move them to the SR, but I&#039;m not sure which bitcoin wallets are the most reputable. Any suggestions?<br /><br />Also, are there any tutorials that explain how bitcoin wallets work? If so, anyone got a link?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I almost never get a reply on here :/<br /><br />I want to use an ewallet, as I&#039;m not dealing with large amounts of money, and I wont be storing anything there long term.<br /><br />What&#039;s a good ewallet? Mybitcoin is dead and so is Instawallet. Are there any other anonymous, reputable ewallet services out there?

The only entity you should be trusting with your Bitcoin is you. Further to that, if you&#039;re looking for a web based wallet to send to in order to break the link between your wallet and your SR wallet, you won&#039;t be able to do that without &#039;tumbling&#039; the coins. All transactions are recorded in the blockchain so you could send them to 100 different wallets before sending them to SR and it would be no different than sending them to just one different wallet.<br /><br />Libertas

				I use Electrum. Its nice as it by default encrypts your wallet, requiring an additional password in order to perform any transactions from the wallet. It also automatically generates new addresses for receiving, something that contributes to anonymity. The one downside to electrum is that the blockchain is not loaded locally, it is validated against servers within the electrum ecosystem that store the blockchain, which comes with it some risk.<br /><br />Managing your own wallet using either the standard bitcoin client, or a local-blockchain based thin client that allows a greater level of encryption, is the best. The only downside is, if you have a slow connection or a slow computer, the blockchain can be a bitch to load and can take a while.<br /><br />I personally do not recommend using web based wallets - you are at the mercy of the web at that point, and as has been a popular topic recently... hacking is rampant. There is no guarantee that any day of the week the exchange hosting your wallet doesn&#039;t go under - and if that happens, chances are you are out of all coins. Based on value trends, even a small amount could really be harmful.<br /><br />I know some of the terminology like blockchain may be a little confusing. The bitcoin wiki is very good for a starting point on almost any topic you may want to know (note, all pages below are NOT on TOR):<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/<br /><br />This page: http://www.weusecoins.com/en/getting-started is a good introductory page and it explains a little bit about a few concepts like Mining.<br /><br />This page lists a lot of the various software that are associated with bitcoin: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Software<br /><br />And, here is some general pages on wallets and wallet security:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet
