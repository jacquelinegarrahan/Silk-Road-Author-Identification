				--== NEW SR VENDOR ==--<br /><br />Hello World. :)<br /><br />We are CannabisCrew.<br /><br />Your EAST COAST suppliers of TOP quality cannabis wares! If you&#039;re on the East Coast, you benefit from fast shipping times!<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Strains:<br /><br />1. Liberty Haze (Barney&#039;s Farm)<br />Prices:<br />1/8oz = $45<br />1/4oz = $85<br />1/2oz = $150<br /><br />2. Alien Kush (Cali Connection)<br />Offering combo prices only at the moment<br /><br />3. Sour Diesel (Cali Connection)<br />Offering combo prices only at the moment<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Why we do this:<br /><br />We aim to be the most honest vendor on Silk Road. To that extent allow us to open up as to WHY we&#039;ve decided to take this next step and become a vendor here in the first place.<br /><br />1. It beats peddling our wares on the street level. (where there&#039;s the most risk of getting caught and ending up in jail)<br /><br />2. We can afford to sell at a lower prices than you could normally get on the street level. BTC keeps going up, up up!<br /><br />3. We have dull computer day jobs that don&#039;t pay nearly as much as SR. We also don&#039;t believe in the war on drugs. We&#039;re nerdy rebels with lots of access to cannabis! So with that spirit in mind, we are committed to being successful and proving top quality wares to all our customers.<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Our Promise:<br /><br />I have been using SR for over a year now to supply my customers with wares I am unable to source on my own. However, we have many sources for Cannabis and other wares. This allows us to be picky and only purchase the HIGHEST quality cannabis available from the numerous suppliers we work with.<br /><br />We know that without an established history of sales, we will first need to earn your trust before our reputation precedes us. Therefore, we will be offering discounts on ALL of our products because we understand YOU are taking a risk on purchasing through us. We also know that SOME buyers will try and scam us. We 100% believe in the Escrow system established here on SR.<br /><br />----=== VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ===----<br /><br />As a buyer I have never had a package go undelivered. This is because I always used my REAL name and address when making my SR purchases.<br /><br />**If your package is not received and it is YOUR fault, will not be providing a refund**<br />You can avoid this by following these simple rules:<br /><br />1. Use your real name and address. We don&#039;t ship to partial names so use your FULL FIRST &amp; LAST NAME. &lt;---We avoid newcomers who fail to comply with this.<br />(Please include your 10 digit zip code EXAMPLE &quot;02829-2345&quot;)<br />2. Don&#039;t tell people what you&#039;ll be receiving, especially if you have roommates!<br />3. Rely on the Escrow system. There&#039;s no need to EVER Finalize Early.<br /><br />The trick to successful shipping is to have your package BLEND in with other mail as much as possible. If you use a fake name you may be red-flagging your address if anything were to happen during transit. We&#039;ve taken every step necessary to prevent that from OUR end, but you must be willing to take the necessary steps to prevent a lost package as well. With a real name the package we send you, simply gets lots in the thousands of others that look just yours. It&#039;s hard to pick out an individual fish when there&#039;s a school of them in front of you and THAT is the goal. -To blend in and disappear among all the other packages just like it.<br /><br />Using your real name is less suspicious because that is what the post office has on file and since nothing is out of ordinary, everything is just business as normal. Please don&#039;t assume the additional risk by providing an incomplete (Andrew S. &lt;---bad!) or by using pseudo-names like &quot;Richard P Herts&quot; (Dick Pee Hurts &lt;---very clever and funny, but also very bad!) so please just work with us and trust us. We&#039;re anxious enough about this business and getting something intercepted because of a customer not taking this seriously is no bueno. Thank you in advance for minimizing ours and your security footprint!!<br /><br />We have created a streamlined process for how we print our shipping labels. It is semi-manual involving a copy/paste command so there is virtually NO room for human error. We double check our accuracy since we are attempting to convey trust and build a good rapport with our customers. We want to do this right.<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Sales &amp; Discreet safe packaging.<br /><br />I may be repeating myself here but we STRIVE to become the most TRUSTED vendor on SR. We will go to great lengths to accomplish this. This includes ensuring our customers orders are packaged in a discreet and safe manner. We employ techniques such as;<br /><br />1. 3M Moisture Barrier Bags (M.B.B&#039;s). This is the ultimate smell-proof bag and the new standard for shipping cannabis!<br />2. Indistinguishable professional/business labeling and packaging. STEALTH is our second priority. Quality is our first!<br />3. Fast shipping times. We ship USPS Priority mail only!<br /><br />When you see &#039;in transit&#039; we&#039;ve processed your order and it&#039;s been shipped.<br /><br />We reserve the right to refuse to sell to those who we don&#039;t trust or have bad purchasing stats. We do check.<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />If SR ever goes down:<br /><br />Hopefully you&#039;ve saved our PGP public key which has our email embedded in it. If not, contact us via:<br />CannabisCrew@tormail.org<br /><br />-if SR is still up we will ignore your emails. Please rely on the SR messaging system first!<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Please take time to read up on us in the official SR forums:<br /><br />(OFFICIAL REVIEW IN SR FORUM &quot;RUMOR MILL&quot; DISCUSSION)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142874.0<br /><br />(IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 50 POST COUNT GO HERE TO LEAVE COMMENTS IN &quot;NEWBIE&quot; DISCUSSION)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=145668.0<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Oh and please don&#039;t encrypt all of your messages. Only sensitive information such as name and address should be sent encrypted. Don&#039;t forget, please include your 10 digit zip code. EXAMPLE &quot;02829-2345&quot;<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQENBFFtTbMBCADI2DPIXF1qG3BuRHl8gX+ZnWJhoybqv51GOXtsW/eKCYbSr0IC<br />bjo9299FimnU37linTctm0s+gOmIBc+mrsnHnMyLebW+y5hzBZlebf+I+VEDX9zP<br />0MfIYgNpkanuNzABGzxWu2NmlSMr8q/fOCiDqJZwpHRBUMnphCeCDyL1KoFSZzzw<br />vyczbnW5w9QSYfQRqFFrg57Phar8AKpGloOXDv1PQcPckO9QTDgnbheDuguFoSAA<br />aF/O2waf18+5t6AvKoca4XfdwLKRp6PrWDa4QNB6y8qp7gYfzfYmTxs/TeTcnGz9<br />Z1pUdlZojXly6daWvfMz+LFl0Q9/9LhbktrJABEBAAG0OENhbm5hYmlzQ3JldyAo<br />U1IgUHJpdmF0ZSBLZXkpIDxDYW5uYWJpc0NyZXdAdG9ybWFpbC5vcmc+iQE3BBMB<br />CgAhBQJRbU2zAhsDBQsJCAcDBRUKCQgLBRYCAwEAAh4BAheAAAoJEFD/TjTIe3An<br />TBoH/isJcdOq8LA79fNRB4iCvk1vpJS/F2RYGGp5XHapeY6K6NCxyRioG17V0zMQ<br />Hw7Cl9QT8W/vzY8sF//BycpqOFSJJ7GNZLBDWnx1sHt4/cRVNMh6xz8OID/7b98B<br />d46JBAKRmdrX1QTlnkgJzyWUllssfWMc279sckX7S1SIaiDH+lp0WFblPYpTKXNZ<br />D6zyRLOKVeMv28sQTYK+u1yuQJ74mFsjEiKAhf7tl/+U4Xx74Lbtr+0IWoHMiEF+<br />RyzafoFsheFDGB1ZfOi2Qb8xYS+6jNJT+tqMV3Pg9XEh6CR9jxFXD37OUK/Xv/2Z<br />vsvh44eEgJFiYn1n8fvQ8v8qX5y5AQ0EUW1NswEIAJ80c0gpc5drPZtWgvJ44EWQ<br />TwCQY93SptuQMH6MCTufhyNpyacAfbRE84vOW+ne6uvofchRpY78rbOk5wHL66p5<br />icAuLAeRnW9Ta9XWjereYQZdVwRlwOmBbsckh1WCyUWxx1LiITowem1/fljROVrJ<br />oTrvUHsMSaydwAA3N6+ybLr0YppVBsqGOqj/d37eoGc6Vc3T/bBgs7rfZoMnwcV0<br />CkrhDxjUNQ/3f/1B5FRrzzRzjvNqIqL/6uJPlNa56hJyYU+jQP7YX4UO9JA8tODM<br />7Vz65KRJOd8NoF1uo4FzKUzjDIN3X6vYJc3RsUDMJ9xJ0spWl9mOE4PdyqJvej8A<br />EQEAAYkBHwQYAQoACQUCUW1NswIbDAAKCRBQ/040yHtwJ6dmCAC06A7q3s6qqOaX<br />/7f9O7F+zY9KqOWIyIny1lNYAgn5x3YW/R2pTbrjnO03c6hIaryZmE08DshNijvB<br />7eG2n0pia4UpzNjdXOHv4fhVW+V0UFsMCExAt7Gx47yhtoKAqaTB1kPjIWtrlHFj<br />yGvdIO9/ueV3P9erBhAyyy1eii7drFfwqg8qPHdO4WXHyV7g80k8RFuEGgY+EdKj<br />VkrlggHqJzOb3WYuB+alJW9u4uZviyVKUv4NAvkG9WthHWGTBdc+RxH4kkBxaRbh<br />TUHhI7Xhklt34eK+Uu3/+YArK8Z0kzg3YqLei5aA2pd3ho9vOuD0QrpWTR/JXPRy<br />+/WHOuNk<br />=BZ8H<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />M.B.B.&#039;s<br /><br />We were recently asked for details regarding our shipping methods. I would like to take the time here to share a little information about that subject.<br /><br />We use thick smell proof bags and several 2mil thick plastic vacuum sealed bags. Currently in the process of also securing 6mil thick anti-static plastic so as to 200% guarantee no odors can escape.<br /><br />Since we are honest, I will tell you that as of this moment we don&#039;t employ the use of Moisture Barrier Bags (MBB)***. However, we are in the process of securing a large order of them because we are as paranoid as you probably are. If that&#039;s what it will take for our customers to feel safe, then that&#039;s what we&#039;ll provide! Of course it doesn&#039;t matter how thick the bag is, or if it has several aluminum layers to obfuscate its contents within an x-ray machine. If cannabis stays in ANY bag long enough, it&#039;s odors WILL eventually steep out. The thicker the bag, the longer it takes for the smell to steep. SO, PACKAGING MATERIALS + THICKNESS (MIL)&nbsp; = RATE AT WHICH CANNABIS ODORS WILL EVENTUALLY STEEP. --=Do not forget this fact!=--<br /><br />Once a bag begins to steep its contents odors, human olfactory glands may not be able to pickup on it but K9&#039;s without a doubt, surely would. So despite what method is used, the trick is to reduce the time between packaging and shipment so as to &quot;beat the clock&quot; of the rate at which cannabis odors will steep. This is why we triple seal and only ship priority! The less time it spends in transit the safer you are!<br /><br />With my buyer account, I&#039;ve received over 30+ herb shipments anywhere from 1/4th of an ounce to a whole LB and never had problems receiving. Sometimes I would open a package and get SUPER concerned about whether or not I was being monitored or watched since many sellers do a VERY poor job at properly packaging for the safety of their customers. Trust me when I say that as sellers we are going ABOVE and beyond what other vendors have used to ship me their wares. We&#039;re all really paranoid about being on SR to begin with and even go to great extents to ensure no fingerprints are left on the outside or inside of the items we plan to ship. Our packaging materials and shipping labels NEVER come into contact with any our herb or other wares. We go to significant lengths to keep everything separate in fear of accidentally exposing some residue onto anything we work with. We&#039;ve even dedicated a special area to handle packaging for this reason alone. It&#039;s an off-limits area to any sort of drugs that could potentially compromise our or your security. As a secondary precaution, we also wipe down the outside of our packages with rubbing alcohol JUST in case there are ANY trace amounts of illicit substances on it. We even wear gloves when dropping of our packages into the priority blue bins! Yes, we&#039;re THAT careful.<br /><br />We are confident that we&#039;ve established a&nbsp; solid process for our shipping practices. As a member of this crew in charge of shipping, I&#039;ve personally conducted over 2 months of research (even sending over 5 packages to myself to ensure they would safely go through USPS sorting) while we were discussing the possibility of becoming vendors here on SR. If one of our package gets intercepted, we assume this would be because it was randomly selected out of thousands for K9 and x-ray inspection and NOT because a K9 alerted on it. That&#039;s our guarantee and we stand by it 100%!<br /><br />We want nothing more than for YOU, as the customer, to feel safe when ordering from us. We&#039;re confident that when you receive your package and realize the lengths we&#039;ve taken to protect you, you will want to keep coming back and order from us again.<br /><br />***As of April 17th, 2013 ALL of our shipments now employ the use of 3M Moisture Barrier Bags. You&#039;ll feel safe receiving from us, guaranteed!<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />We are starting this thread to help customers decide whether or not they should buy from us. We will be checking the forums to answer any questions you have about our quality and selection of wares.<br /><br />PLEASE PROVIDE HONEST FEEDBACK! If you don&#039;t like something we did or have suggestions on how we can improve, please feel free to post those suggestions here. For suggestions regarding our shipping practices, please PM us and we will listen!!<br /><br />Good, Bad or indifferent. We want to hear from you. Our customers are the key to our success. We understand that if we keep you happy, you will help us attain our goals.<br /><br />Happy toking and best wishes to all!<br />-CannabisCrew

				Cannabis Crew is such a top notch vendor!&nbsp; I usually don&#039;t mess with new vendors but after looking over their vendor page and reviews they seemed legit.&nbsp; I had a couple questions so I sent a message late in the evening and received a response within 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; I placed my order that night and the order went into transit that morning and received the package two days later.&nbsp; These guys are legit and will be moving up in the rankings in no time.&nbsp; The package was very stealth and no one would have been able to know what was in it.&nbsp; I got a little extra in the package as well.&nbsp; Product was excellent and you can&#039;t beat the prices.&nbsp; I will be back for more Crew!!

We&#039;re not presently shipping anything over 1/2oz at this moment. We simply don&#039;t have the available cashflow to take on the extra weight for QP&#039;s or Bulk. We have made that one of our major milestones however. In the future, as our business grows we hope to offer bulk in denominations of Quarter Pound, Half Pound, and Full Pound. Please remember that we&#039;re still new and soliciting new customers so the herb we stock is meant solely for personal amount sales. We&#039;re committed to being successful here though! The bulk sizing will come with time my friend. The pricing will be extremely competitive and our shipping practices will still be as rigorous as ever.<br /><br />Once we start shipping bulk, don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll make an announcement here in the forums and try to solicit sales for those weights!<br /><br />Happy toking brotha!<br />-CC

It reduces the amount of regular shipments and thereby your security footprint. Some of our potential customers have been asking the same about Ounces so this is what we&#039;re going to do. <br /><br />We will be offering some incredible pricing ($280/oz at 28.3grams) with free BHO budder and pollen hash as extras for our 4/20 sale special. The special will allow you to mix &#039;n match any of our strains in 1 gram denominations so you are in FULL control of what you receive while STILL benefiting from exceptional pricing (the .3 grams will be divided amongst the 3 equally divided strains or simply added to the largest quantity strain from your OWN personal selection). We always add extra weight by .3 - .5 anyways. Some of our 1/8ths are overweight by a full gram! EVERYTHING we ship will be overweight guaranteed, you can be sure of that every time! Expect to see these listings up this week as we approach our favorite holiday :)<br /><br />Happy toking,<br />-CC<br />

				Just got my first SR order today!&nbsp; I happened to choose Cannabis Crew for the honor.&nbsp; They were new, I was new, they were pleasant and polite to deal with, the shipping was fast, the stealth was excellent.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and the product is very nice&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; <br /><br />I smelled nothing on the outside package, and nothing when I opened it.&nbsp; The actual container for my weed keeps all the smell inside too, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; I&#039;m so used to judging good quality weed by smelling how much of it is leaking through the lunch baggie, that this is a nice twist.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m a happy customer and would definitely buy from you guys again!&nbsp; :)

				CC came through for me with a very generous sample. I got almost an eighth of the Liberty Haze, a half gram of pollen hash and some BHO budder.<br /><br />The shipping time was excellent. 3 days max, even less I believe. The stealth was adequate, my only recommendation which I have already told CC is to use MBB in the future. Not a huge deal but always good to be a step ahead of the enemy. With that being said, I enjoyed the write-up on the bag and the statistics on the back. Its something simple yet nice which differentiates you from the rest and adds character to your product so keep that up!<br /><br />One thing that really separates CC from most vendors I&#039;ve encountered on the Road is how dedicated they seem to their cause. They get an A+ for communication and are definitely committed to answering any questions and alleviating any concerns that you might have.<br /><br />As far as the product, here is a picture I took:<br />http://i.imgur.com/oXb8xfZ.jpg<br /><br />As you can see the bud is certainly of high quality. While there may be better deals for the price CC definitely has competitive advantages in that his shipping times are probably faster and the operation they run is honest and honorable. The bud does smoke better than it looks giving me a very focused high.<br /><br />The budder was nice. It has a delicious potent smell to it and tasted great. But with that being said, it did leave some residue on the nail. Not a huge deal.<br /><br />The pollen hash is excellent. Break some up and sprinkle it on a bowl and it will easily give you the kick you are seeking. Potent and slow burning.<br /><br />All in all CC is a solid vendor with decent product at a fair price. They are great guys and run a good operation and you can tell from the effort they put into their product and packaging that they truly take this seriously and want to succeed. I wish you guys the best of luck in your endeavors on the Road and have no qualms recommending you!

				<br />First of all -Thank you for the good wishes everybody! We really appreciate all the positive feedback we&#039;ve been receiving. It really does make us feel great to know our customers are happy! <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=145668.msg1028940#msg1028940">Quote from: bh17 on April 18, 2013, 08:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That Liberty Haze looks the bomb.<br /><br />If you ever venture into international orders in the future make sure you drop a post on the forums.

It&#039;s little trickier and adds to the overall complexity of our operation but we are exploring different options. We won&#039;t do anything until we&#039;re absolutely sure our process is solid as we don&#039;t want to risk our customers&#039; safety with any potential mistake. We&#039;ve certainly hit the ground running and orders are coming in at a nice pace so international shipping is something we&#039;re not entirely focusing on for the moment, but it will come in time. Also, consider that we just started our operation and see international orders as one of our future milestones.<br /><br />Happy toking!<br />-CC

				WOW CannabisCrew!&nbsp; You have far exceeded all of my expectations!!!<br /><br />The packaging was seriously stealth.&nbsp; A definite 6/5!&nbsp; No smells at all (which worried me at first), but once I got through the several layers and reached the holy grail that is the Liberty Haze.... oh boy was I in for a pleasant surprise.&nbsp; The bag was not crushed so once I opened it the buds were still fluffy and dank.&nbsp; The smell was sweet with a hint of citrus and pine.&nbsp; It&#039;s honestly difficult to describe since I&#039;ve never really smelled bud like this and I consider myself a seasoned smoker.&nbsp; <br /><br />The bud is definitely top quality.&nbsp; The high was energetic, alert, and uplifting.&nbsp; Great for the day smokers!&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall an EXCELLENT transaction from start to finish.&nbsp; CC answered all of my questions in a timely fashion (almost instantly) and were professional throughout.&nbsp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND and will definitely order from again.&nbsp; Thanks CC!

				I LOVE the CREW. I bought the satavia combo and OMG the Alien is litterally out of this world, no wonder it is called that. The buds are a cool blueish color with all sorts of crystals and hairs on it, WOW is an understatement. The SD has that slight diesel taste, and the buzz is great. The Liberty Haze is excellent. This is the second time I have gotten that from them and yummy, it has a wonderful fruity aftertaste. Love you all, you pkg beats anyone hands down that I have received pkgs from. Your descriptions are right on par and you can tell that you know the product!!!! See you all soon Keep up the GREAT work

				So just received my first bud/ganja/herb/green/weed whatever in the mail. I&#039;d ordered some 2C-NBOME before but was definitely skeptical about buying weed since the thought of getting caught is terrifying. I messaged the crew and received some fast responses and that made me feel a little more confident in ordering. The last 3 days have been sorta nerve wrecking but I got a package in the mail today addressed to me and looking at the return I was like, WTF? What&#039;s this..<br /><br />To my surprise it was a bag within a bag, within another bag and I just got more and more excited because I knew at that point this was probably my weed. The fact there are so many bags made me feel a shit ton better and these guys (or girls) really know their packaging. The whole time I&#039;m opening this time I&#039;m going HOLY SHIT. YES, YES, YES, YES, -God damn I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m finally blazing up some proper herb!!!!! This weed is fucking awesome and I&#039;m really glad I picked these guys as my vendor!!! Do ALL vendors wrap up their weed like this or are these guys the exception going above and beyond? Anyways, I&#039;m happy with everything and I hope these guys stick around for a while cuz I&#039;m coming back for more lol THANKS CC you guys are the shiiiiiittttt!

				Ok so here&#039;s my review of the Cannabis Crew!<br /><br />Communication: This vendor was a joy to be incontact with, fast response times were always there not to mention the politeness. I took way longer than when I was supposed to have the reviews up due to work &amp; they totally understood. There isn&#039;t a doubt in my mind that the crew would be anything less than great if they had to deal with a re-ship or lost pack...<br /><br />Shipping: Got here super fast, not the fastest I have ever seen from SR vendors but nonetheless they made the average time, which is saying a lot because I only use fast vendors!<br /><br />Stealth: The outside looked nice &amp; clean, not too much overtaping! Not noticeable at all. Looked like any other normal pack that should legally be in the mail. On the inside was a large MBB which inside contained another bag that contained the strains. No doubt that this was undetectable to a trained K9. I even liked that each strain was packaged in different sections in their own parts. Sounds stupid on text but if you see their setup you will understand.<br /><br />The thing I like most about this vendor is their variety. Most vendors only have 1 or 2 strains &amp; I got a hefty helping of all 3 in my sampler!<br /><br />Liberty Haze-<br /><br />Appearance…..9/10 Dense sugary bud, lots of trichomes<br /><br />Potency……..8.5/10 Not too much of a couch lock, pretty comforting bud, cannabis cup winner!<br /><br />Effect….. 9.0/10 Sativa based haze, uplifting high.<br /><br />Smell…..pine/lemon/sweet<br /><br />Taste…Lemon chew sweet<br /><br /><br />Sour Diesel-<br /><br />Appearance... The bud has light fluffy calyx’s which are oozing crystal upon crystal. Light orange hairs and good leaf to calyx ratio.<br /><br />Smell.... smell includes a strong lemony, cream soda kind of smell. Very hard to explain but it’s unique.<br /><br />Taste...Very fruity, smooth on the inhale and exhale leaving sweet tang on the tongue as it leaves your lungs. I’d say the smell is almost the taste but my mouth is watering still as I am typing this after an hour since the last one. that should say it all!<br /><br />High... After a few tokes it hits you. Buzz lasts for quite some time so can leave an hour before each one. However I love weed and the more moreish it is, the more I like to chain smoke. Good sativa high<br /><br />Strain: Alien Kush-----&gt; Can&#039;t get a hosting site to work, will update!<br /><br />Category: Hybrid<br /><br />Color/Appearance (Bag Appeal) - (9/10) - These buds came out nice &amp; fluffy! For some reason I fall in love with the fluffier ones more! The buds featured almost two different shades of green one light, one dark. The hairs were super lengthy!<br /><br />Trich Coverage - (9.25/10) The tricks were lengthy but they didn&#039;t cover the whole bud. They really stuck out to an extent to where they were easy to see with a mag glass! I like!<br /><br />Trim Job - (9/10) Someone sit down with these buds when they were harvested and showed them some luvin&#039; for sure. You can always tell when you are smoking buds someone truly cared about, these had that appeal!<br /><br />Flush (9.50) - Strain Definitely had a hard hit to it *not harsh* I loved it. This strain would have been almost unbearable without the right flush! well done!<br /><br />Cure - (9.0) Probably could have pulled a little sooner from curing, I felt like maybe since the buds were fluffier that the cure time should have been a little lower to prevent dryness.<br /><br />Smell (8.5/10) Spicy, with notes of piney vegetation, and soil — it has hints of sweetness from the LVPK as well.<br /><br />Taste (9.5/10) Piney sweetness with a hint of Kushy spice that hangs in the back of your throat rather than hitting the tongue at the forefront.<br /><br />Buzz (8.9/10) Starting off almost rushy at times, the Sativa nature definitely comes out early in this cross.&nbsp; Very strong ocular attention and facial/head pressure made it feel a little overwhelming or bleary at times despite its clear and even-handed mental state.&nbsp; The relaxed body and thoughtful, philosophical mindstate this strain provides makes this one good for quiet conversations with friends, reading, or being creative.&nbsp; Overall it feels like a pretty even hybrid, bringing out more of the Indica as it progressed.

				Ordered from CC about two weeks ago now. CC vastly exceeded all my expectations for a vendor. There was a slight mixup on their behalf with the PGP key I used to encrypt my information (they had the wrong one posted on their page). They sent me the correct key to use and I sent my encrypted information back. Nothing major at all.<br /><br />I was compensated VERY well for this - I don&#039;t have a scale but both bags looked fat + I got some free Alien Kush and some free BHO Budder.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the breakdown:<br /><br />Communication: 5/5 - Answered every question I had in an extremely timely manner. We were able to sort out the issue with the PGP key in less than an hour from the time I read their message and my order went out the same day.<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5 - The shipping was absolutely amazing. The most professional shipping I&#039;ve seen on the Road yet. 0 Smell, great labeling, and even some information about the bud itself. Shipped from their location to my mailbox in 2 days of being marked &quot;In Transit&quot;<br /><br />The Bud: 5/5 - This is some potent shit. Ive been smoking daily for way too long now but this stuff still puts me in a nice place with 1-2 personal sized bowls in my chillum. <br /><br />Sour Diesel: Just smelling this you can tell it&#039;s going to knock you on your ass.. and it does. Buds are large, dense, and beautiful. The whole eighth+ I got was 2 nugs.<br /><br />Liberty Haze: Smells absolutely incredible. A mixture of citrusy / piney / earthy smells. It&#039;s a great hybrid strain - an amazing mixture of a cerebral high and body high. Buds are very light and fluffy. <br /><br />Overall, CC is the REAL DEAL. These guys mean business and they sure as shit know how to run one. Awesome people to work with and awesome weed at a great price.<br /><br />Don&#039;t hesitate, hit these guys up!

				CannabisCrew has great product, from packaging to quality. Shipping was also super fast.<br /><br />Although Liberty Haze struck me as a little &quot;speedy&quot;, it was good in the mornings in moderation. The high kept me focused and motivated while relieving some of my physical discomfort (bad hip).<br /><br />Alien Kush is a whole other ball game. This strain really worked as advertised, keeping me in a good mood and relieving some physical pain without destroying my ability to function. It&#039;s even pretty to look at, with so many crystals hanging off it, I almost felt bad handling the buds. Tastes and smells uniquely spicy/sweet. My only negative comment is that I&#039;m disappointed CC isn&#039;t offering it outside of combo packages. Seriously, guys. I could smoke this all day, every day.<br /><br />CC also sent along a generous sample of Sour Diesel, which needs no introduction. But what a pleasant surprise that was.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m really looking forward to doing more business with CC and seeing what else they&#039;ll have to offer in the future!
