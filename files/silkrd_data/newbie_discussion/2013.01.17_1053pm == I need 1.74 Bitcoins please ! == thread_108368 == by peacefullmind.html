It was only certain burgers that had horse meat in them, but it&#039;s fucked that it happened at all. One of the factories that supplies them is near me, dunno what the fuck they were thinking, talk about short term gain.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve seen of the US meat industry does scare the shit out of me though. Heard dodgy things about milk too?<br /><br />And here, OP, at this rate of increase, in 2 days you&#039;ll probably be able to afford to buy it anyway lol

				Asking for nearly $30 is not cool IMO.&nbsp; Make a smaller order or buy more coin, eh?&nbsp; <br /><br />For those of you buying BTC for the 1st time and those of you making your first order:&nbsp; You are going to need extra BTC to pay for things like shipping.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are buying BTC to cover a single order then add 20% to what you think you are going to need.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget to add other fees depending on how you are buying your BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nothing worse than waiting &amp; waiting &amp; waiting for BTC to show up in your account only to find you are .0001 short.&nbsp; If you can, load up on BTC instead of buying coin for each and every purchase.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
