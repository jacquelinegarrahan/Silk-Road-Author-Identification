				I wanted to try this forever, will finally obtain MDA so I can do this combo.<br /><br />I read awesome things about it, in the right proportion it should give the perfect roll.<br />Now the setting is a indoor rave. I want to dance all night, the powerful energetic roll that I got the first few times doing MDMA alone, it feels like your flying. Empathy is important but not my main focus. I want to be lost in the music. I don&#039;&#039;t get this much energy anymore when I do mdma, I ususally get floored or don&#039;&#039;t have enough energy to rave all night, still drowning in euphoria.<br />Now I don&#039;&#039;t want to be tripping out, as I want to socialise. So some trippyness is cool like some mild visuals, but no real tripping.<br /><br />So I was thinking about going either 70mg of each or 90mg MDMA + 60mg MDA (followed by 80-100mg MDMA redose 1,5 hour later).&nbsp; What are the differences between these two ratios in your opinion? Usually 150mg MDMA will get me going very strong, 120mg is a nice roll, but nothing too intense. So how will this hit me in your opinion?<br /><br />I somewhat lost the magic. I dont have those insane rolls like the first times anymore, I used it a little too much (once every 3-4 weeks for 9 months). I still roll very hard, but not MAGICAL. Will this bring it back a little you think?<br /><br />Final question, in the next rave, I just want to have a pure MDMA roll-like experience, no tripping, but will doing 100mg MDMA + 30mg MDA give a stronger roll than 140mg MDMA only without adding trippyness (due to stronger dopamine high =body high?)

				It all depends on the person really.&nbsp; Me personally I love MDA more because it will last longer and I love the trippy effect towards the end of the roll.&nbsp; Some combo&#039;s I have taken in the past 125mg MDA + 100mg MDMA, or I would just take MDA first then boost with MDMA.&nbsp; Fucking amazing!

				Yeah lots of people like combining the two but honestly MDA is plenty fun on it&#039;s own. I find MDA is more physical and less emotional but they are still very similar. MDMA sometimes feels like it&#039;s whispering to you while a good dose of MDA will often just shove you into a different place.<br /><br />So my suggestion, give it a try on it&#039;s own and see how you like it and then decide if you want to mix and match after that.

				Coming down off of MDMA and hitting bongs used to be one of my favorite things. Haven&#039;t used it in a very long time, feel as if i&#039;ve slightly out grown it, but no doubt it is an amazing feeling when you&#039;re &#039;rushing&#039;.
