				Well...hello everybody! I just registered here and on SR and I just found out that it even existed...truly amazing and great and etc..<br /><br /><br />BUT. I live in switzerland. The police isn&#039;t very kind here and even the internets are pretty controlled. I&#039;m asking myself..with those shipments..don&#039;t they have dogs or something to sniff it all out? Well at least LSD doesn&#039;t have a smell and can&#039;t be found right? And thats what I&#039;m interested in...blotters. Yeah I know it was invented here and Albert Hofmann was swiss etc..I know. But its still difficoult to find certain things here, ok? Is anybody else here in switzerland? Is it 100% safe to order blotters? How do I even get BitCoins? I am truly a newbie...well I would really appreciate any links and stuff. Anyone who can help me out gets a virtual hug from me&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*<br /><br />Please help me out :-\<br />It&#039;s all so....out of reach&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(

Yes, they do have heroin clincs in CH. They don&#039;t use methadone for addiction treatment like they do here in the US<br /><br />3. Yes I&#039;ve been there. No your cops aren&#039;t worse than the UK (or even France). And if the drug laws are strict, the tax laws and the pricay protections are pretty fucking libertarian. There are millions of US dollars sitting in Swiss banks that CH is trying to keep secret from the US.<br /><br />4. That was tongue-in-cheek. I was only speaking for myself. Yes there are sellers in CH as well as vendors in the EU and US that both ship internationally (obviously you&#039;re better off with the EU).<br /><br />Your drug laws are no where near as strict as the US and Australia, and there are boatloads of Americans and Aussies. Shit, we have more drug offenders imprisoned the all of the EU, CH, and Russia combined. Switzerland is not that strict; I&#039;m sorry. And again, I&#039;ve been there.
