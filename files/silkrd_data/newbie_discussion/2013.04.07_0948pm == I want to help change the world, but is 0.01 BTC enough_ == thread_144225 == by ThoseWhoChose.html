				I&#039;ve been thinking recently. way too damn much especially after one day I smoked dmt. Before that happened I was really high on heroin and accidentally ordered dmt without really thinking about it. about a week later I remember what I did and was curious about trying it even though I never did any research on it, the only thing I knew about it that it was in our bodies and plants and many other things. Once I tried this, it changed who I was forever. Never do I feel the need to stick a needle in my arm, never feel the need to harm or hurt or steal from anyone in this world. I&#039;ve realized all the problems in the world really route from humans misunderstanding eachother. So I&#039;m trying to get more DMT to see if it helps certain individuals find who they really are. I know its not going to work the same on me as others but I believe it will help them understand their subconscious more. So what I have is only 0.01 btc atm, and 14 USD on paypal but it will change soon. This is just a start and i&#039;m sure many people won&#039;t give a fuck but if I don&#039;t try at all then no one would ever read this. So if anyone can help me out with dmt with what I have right now that would be great, but not expected. I&#039;m not doing it for profit I&#039;m actually buying it to give it away.
