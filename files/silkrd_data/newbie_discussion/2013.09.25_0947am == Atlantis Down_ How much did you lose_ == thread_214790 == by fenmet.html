It sketched me out from the moment I heard about it. It amazes me that people were so quick to trust them. For the first couple of months before purchasing anything from SR, I browsed the forums incessantly to educate myself on the relevant security practices. Thankfully, it instilled a healthy dose of paranoia in me.<br /><br />It makes me cringe when I see people openly posting about using SR on public Facebook group pages under their real accounts and names ::)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				I browsed it a few times when SR was down, but like sugarleaf, I spent quite a while browsing the SR forums, reading up on PGP, and how it all works etc before i placed my first order. I only browsed atlantis out of curiosity when I couldn&#039;t get on SR :/
