				I&#039;ve noticed quite a few topics over here on the &#039;newbies&#039; board are somewhat misguided as to what i believe is a safe and effective way of using TSR.<br /><br />This is just a quick and simple thread in order to try and help some people who seem to be more interested in their post count than they do about actually reading up and understanding TSR and how to safely use it.<br /><br />A lot of this is pasted from other forums on TSR but i thought it&#039;d be good to get this posted up on the newbies forum as I&#039;m sure a lot of new members are not properly reading up on all the important safety information.<br /><br />First off give this a quick read, its very short and you&#039;re suppose to read it before you post anyway ;)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42090.0<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to buy anything make sure you first understand how PGP encryption works these threads have been created in order to help you understand how it works and how to download, install and use it:<br /><br />GPG (Step-by-Step: Windows Pictorial)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />Are you Paralyzed by PGP?

I find it much better to lurk around a forum and understand it before i go galloping into the parts of the forum that need a higher post count and as of that expect you to understand at least the basics of what is going on around the place.<br /><br />You need a 100 posts in order to give karma, that can be your next job to work on ;)
