				I have read many warnings about not FE, although i&#039;ve done it a couple of times, with no problems (not to say you should do it lol). My problem has been that i&#039;ve been Finalizing as soon as opening the package, rather than waiting until i&#039;ve tested it. Unfortunately, a couple of highly rated vendors appear to have sent me stuff which is below the quality advertized. Is it worth me complaining to them, or should I just leave them negative feedback.

				Hi - vendor speaking here, so take what you read with that in mind.<br /><br />I believe &quot;quality&quot; issues can not be raised if purely subjective (you don&#039;t like it)...but if you are credible and can prove through test etc then have a discussion. I believe SR generally does not consider &quot;quality&quot; a reasonable grounds for rebate but if your delivery is absolute shocking bad - or perhaps not even what you requested, then I personally feel you have grounds for complaint.<br /><br />If you have FE&#039;d then DON&#039;T...!!!! I&#039;m a pretty new vendor, though have settled near to 200 transactions now in less than two month by being decent with people and supplying good gear...it&#039;s quite simple! FE is not needed if the quantity small, and the vendor confident of the sale. I personally never ask for FE.<br /><br />Any vendor worth his salt should deal professionally with any issue arising and discuss openly. The resolution should be amicable.<br /><br />It boils down to some perhaps not being as straight as you&#039;d hope and I&#039;m sorry you&#039;ve experienced that.<br /><br />Good luck in the future - there are good vendors out there...<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc

				Thanks for the advice buddy! It is not just a case of me not being partial to one drug or the other, more that the product sent was of a far lower quality than that advertized by the vendor. I don&#039;t expect to get a refund, having finalized, but I think that the vendor in question owes me an explanation, particularly if he wants my business again. My policy, in general, is not to leave negative feedback unless I have contacted the vendor and explained my reasons for doing so. Do you think this is fair, or am I being too nice about it, lol?!

				Leaving negative feedback without first contacting the vendor is pretty poor etiquette in my book. I&#039;ve never received bad product on this site, but I think my plan would be not to accuse anyone of anything because at the end of the day there&#039;s not a lot you can do about it.<br /><br />I would:<br /><br />Contact vendor telling him I think there may be something wrong with this batch, can he confirm I got the same as everyone else, and if it&#039;s a new batch is there a chance of a partial refund.<br /><br />Then wait to see how it gets resolved. If you agree some resolution then leave 5/5 with a comment that the product didn&#039;t live up to your expectations but seller resolved amicably.<br /><br />If he&#039;s an arse about it, tell him you intend to leave honest feedback about your disappointment. Then leave feedback accordingly, and note the good points if any too e.g., good stealth, speedy shipping etc. And leave a short, polite but to the point post in his feedback thread on here.<br /><br />Then go elsewhere in future, and if you&#039;re at all bitter about the situation, keep reminding yourself how you&#039;re far more likely to be ripped off on the street than on here.<br /><br />

				This should be an important lesson. I got shabby product the first time I made an order, but thankfully I didn&#039;t finalize until I realized there was something wrong, and the vendor gave me a significant refund. <br /><br />I do think you owe the vendor the chance to explain himself before leaving bad feedback, but as mentioned above, just think about how much better this system is than dealing with shady characters in the real world, who can&#039;t be hit with negative feedback even if you wanted to.

				Yeah, if only there was escrow/feedback on the streets lol. I think SR offers a great service, but when you start off it&#039;s certainly worth taking certain measures to ensure satisfaction. Thanks to everyone for the support/advice. Once bitten, twice shy!!!

				Always contact the vendor first lets face it whats the point in making an enemy. I once had gram of cocaine arrive and it was appalling, the seller has very high feedback scores and I think it was only my second time purchasing from them. I contacted the seller explained the situation and had a message back apologizing stating no one else had come back saying the same but as a GOGW if I purchased another next week when the new stock came in they would make it worth my while. One week later vendor messages me saying new stocks in, purchased a gram got gram and a half come through&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Always give the benefit of the doubt, remember vendors chat to each other as well and if they have someone going straight to the mods before approaching them there is a good chance they will pass that on and people wont want to deal with you.<br /><br />In future just don&#039;t FE.
