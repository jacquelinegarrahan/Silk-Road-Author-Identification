				Hello, I am about to start selling high quality Mexican commercial weed. Some would consider it &quot;mid-grade&quot; quailty. Very very little seeds. I&#039;m going to be offering a low price to get things started up. <br /><br />My question, are people interested in this product at a good price?<br />Also, what all products do I need to package weed correctly? A vacuum sealer obviously but what else?<br /><br />Thank you!

				I hear double and tripple vac seals with beach baths on each layer are a must but I don&#039;t know for sure, it&#039;s not my product. :) what prices are you going to be offering? Do you have a vendor link yet?

				I would check into the moisture barrier bags that most people rave about. Apparently they&#039;re a lot less risk than regular multi vacuum sealing with a food saver. <br /><br />There are some good threads, one dedicated to them bags and vendors are listed also <br /><br />As for the Reggie... I&#039;ve been looking all through my city and I can&#039;t find any. I am too paranoid to ship a huge amount of weed but what kind of price per lb?<br /><br />

				Thanks for the feedback guys. Ive read about the heat sealing packaging then vac seal? Anyone know about that? I&#039;m definitely gonna read all I can on the security side.<br /><br />As for large amounts, assuming I can actually ship that much safely I would probably charge around 1000 a pound, possibly less depending on my cost. Seems like people are receptive and I&#039;ll be purchasing a vendor account soon!<br /><br />I&#039;ll update this thread when I do.

You should learn to use it if you plan to vend on the Silk Road.

				Hey reggie,<br /><br />While I encourage PGP, I&#039;m not using it at this time (imminent computer failure-got it on dialysis now :P). Because I&#039;m not using it, if the vendor REQUIRES PGP, I typically have to find another vendor.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is, I have never seen a deal so great that I felt it necessary to start using PGP. I have asked several vendors and most don&#039;t require it but heavily encourage it. A few have directed me to privnote as an alternative.<br /><br />As soon as I get this machine off of dialysis, I will get PGP working again but I&#039;m riding it out until total failure.<br /><br /><br />$1000/lb for reggie seems high to me but that&#039;s probably because I&#039;m getting medicinal for $2000, locally. The last lb of reggie I bought was so awful I had to take it back to the pusher for a refund. After he broke it down to look at my complaints, he threw it right in the trash. That one was $4-450. The deal before that was $525 and much better quality, great actually. Since I haven&#039;t been able to find any, I&#039;d probably be willing to pay $600 locally, I think ~750 is a fair price on SR. But, I don&#039;t set your price, just offering some suggestions. By the way, I&#039;m speaking from when I was in a state that borders Mexico.

				Hiding - Thanks for the reply - The price I&#039;ll be paying per LB (while im still getting one at a time) is slightly higher than the prices your used to paying. To a guy living near the border then 750 is a normal price per LB but to a guy living further north then the price will go up. I would actually be willing to come down in price depending on cost. And of course, my first couple sales will be lower too! Looking at some of the other reggie vendors you have to get 5 LB&#039;s at once to get them for the 750 price. Im thinking maybe 850-900 would be a fair price, considering that Im buying them first and making SURE that quality is worth the money. The extra money you&#039;d spend would prevent you from getting a bunk bag, thats for sure. Also I may be a little more in costs for the product but that is because I always make sure I get the high quality stuff, not the bunk. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				I think you&#039;re on the right track.<br /><br />Like I said, it is scarce in my city and medicinal is abundant. <br /><br />I called a friend and he recently paid 60 for an oz of good Reggie. I told him I felt he overpaid and he got a bit defensive. <br /><br />My logic was:<br />60/oz for 5% weed<br />180/oz for 15-20% weed<br /><br />We agreed to write it out at 1:3 and the cost matched. The issue was the Reggie weed growing conditions and pesticides... After considering that would it be worth getting Reggie at that price?<br /><br />He was indifferent and in the end so was I because I love Reggie. I think more of it needs to return. I grew up smoking good weed and shit weed. But by todays standard it was all shit weed i guess. Today&#039;s weed would probably kill me.<br /><br />If the SR price is ~900 then I think it&#039;s fair to go there. Especially if your quality can meet or exceed others. Mostly though, if you can protect your customers on these shipments by doing a lot of the moisture barrier research and shipping methods are safe, from what I read on feedback of other vendors, you&#039;ll be bringing a well deserved service and justice to silk road. <br /><br />It seems like I read way too many &quot;stealth was terrible could smell outside the package. Single vacuum sealed and zero stealth&quot; type of responses. <br /><br />If you can ship it safe, the price isn&#039;t unreasonable. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to PM you on some other stuff.<br /><br />Take care of the roadians and they&#039;ll take care of you.<br /><br />
