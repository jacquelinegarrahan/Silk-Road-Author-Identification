				Has anyone used paypaltobitcoin.com? I like the idea but it seems like such a scam. If you could share your experience/opinion of them I would appreciate it. <br /><br />I used bitinstant old site and loved it for the most part. I just made a cash deposit over the weekend with the new site and had a bunch of shitty problems. First there was the identity piece which was stupid but after a while was able to make a order. The zipzap payment went fine, but bitinstant emailed me saying the transaction failed.&nbsp; I emailed them info back and after dealing with customer service for a while they said that they had fixed it. They emailed me a blockchain link for the address they sent them to. Which wasnt mine. When I got back to them I told them it was not the address I put in the order and I always check the address extremely carefully to avoid this sort of thing. But it was too late, they said they cant do anything now it is out of their system.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So basically they lost about 120$ of my money, not a huge deal, but really annoying and they have lost my trust at least for now. I am looking for a simple cash alternative and if that is not a scam it seems like a good system. <br />

				&nbsp;8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />I have found that you can purchase bitcoins through eBay these days.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of vendors and they&#039;re really quick to pay up.&nbsp; The only thing is that they&#039;re taxed like a mofo&#039;.&nbsp; Though it&#039;s opened me up to the idea of selling off fractions of bitcoins in order to cash out at the max.&nbsp; On average a vendor on eBay is selling a bitcoin for $150+.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve even seen it broken down to where a bitcoin in the end is $500+ no shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are about 1,000+ vendors on ebay right now 6/17/13.&nbsp; bitinstant has not done me wrong yet, i guess it&#039;s a hit and miss thing with them when it comes to&nbsp; flawlessness.&nbsp;

				ebay seems good but the prices are like double what they&#039;re worth. Who would actually pay 500$ for 1btc?? I would use them but only if there were no other options. :/

				Its a suppply and demand type thing....most people looking on ebay for bc&#039;s want them quick fast and in a hurry and dont mind spending the additional to get what they want when they want it. But i agree with the above posted. Ive not had a single problem out of bitinstant. If they are slow i email them and usually get a quick response back and within 2-3 hours tops i have it in my wallet. But i understand some people situations they cant get to to place to pay for bitinstant and have to use ebay. ive also heard lots of good things about blueskytraders, but everytime ive contacted them there is usually a waiting list. Wouldnt hurt to try them if you dont mind the waiting list and are in no rush.

				I&#039;d use blueskytraders except that there arent any Bank of America&#039;s near me right now. It also says they want new clients to make their first transaction at least 400$. I dont need that much BTC or can really afford that, and since I&#039;m not familiar with the system I wouldn&#039;t be really cool with that.<br /><br />Anybody use btcquick.com before?

				I think the inflated prices on ebay are really for newbies or ultra paranoid ass pps, it&#039;s not like you can&#039;t PGP a vendor on Ebay to give you a better deal in order to expedite a purchase.&nbsp; Off site dealings happen all over, you just have to sniff out the people that are down for something like that and cross your fingers they don&#039;t rip you off.&nbsp; I think most people have a good 9th sense of awareness they just don&#039;t practice it enough.&nbsp;
