				Looking to see what happened but I placed an order yesterday and all went OK - BTC was placed in escrow, shipper processed the order and I went to sleep...<br /><br />Woke up this morning and logged in to see my BTC balance at zero (it was only .27) and that I had no orders pending.<br /><br />When I log in to my account and look at the history it shows that it was finalized already (didn&#039;t do) and that my balance was moved from my account all around the same time yesterday... there are no notes attached to the withdrawal and I did not receive them in my wallet.<br /><br />I&#039;ve changed my passwords just in case but it seems odd on my first order ever that this happened - what could the reasons be? Anyone I can ask to see what happened?

				ALWAYS make sure to check the SR URL in your browser is correct before entering your PIN, password, or making a transaction. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion is the real deal - remember the vb5piz3r part. Unfortunately there are a lot of phishing scams out there and we must always be careful.

				Yeah, it looks like unfortunately someone got into your account.<br /><br />Besides changing your password and pin immediately to one you don&#039;t use on any other site, I would highly recommend only logging into SR from a Live USB/CD just in case your system is somehow infected. Also, make sure you take the time to memorize the real SR address so you don&#039;t fall victim to a phishing scam.

				Damn man, that sucks. But since it was FE&#039;d, is there no chance that the order was already in the mail? You might still get you product<br /><br />ANYWAY I&#039;m off to change my PW and PIN
