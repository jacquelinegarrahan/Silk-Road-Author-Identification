				So we put up a $500 deposit. When do we get it back? What comes out of the deposit? I assume if we as the seller do something faulty but how is that determined? Can we get our money back after so long or is it when we choose to stop selling? And what happens if the site foes down? How do we know we will get our deposit back? I couldn&#039;t find anything on this so sorry if it&#039;s a question that is already answered.

				500 is the deposit for account creation, the rest you have to make back on profit which you can if you a smart seller.<br /><br />There is no security deposit

				prices on here for everything but bud are much higher than in my area. <br /><br />As far as I see, paying $500 to make thousands a week potentially (less or more in some cases but you could make $500 profit a month with your eyes closed as a seller).<br /><br />This keeps real suppliers as the ones becoming sellers because the 5 bills is nothing to them, they make it up quick.&nbsp; It also keeps fraudsters out, not that anyone doesnt scam here but it would be a lot harder than people on forums saying they have and idiot morons mail them money for product they never receive and its over...people investing time and money are less likely to waste their own time scamming unless they have a giant plot, but it eliminates the $100-500 &quot;cash and grab&quot; schemes on other sites online.<br /><br />Unfortunately, to the person who grows an extra couple ounces of pot, or has a few extra pills, tabs, X, whatever, the fee keeps them out of the game.&nbsp; The rules keep bad people from selling, but also limit the average joe from getting in on it.&nbsp; Gotta pay to play and this is for the big boys...

				When you make it to 1500 in sales, you may request your original bond back from SR. At the admin&#039;s discretion, they will either return it or continue to hold it. That&#039;s what I remember from reading the seller agreement.<br /><br />I was close... here is the text from the seller&#039;s agreement:<br /><br />&quot;Bond<br />You are required to pay a bond when opening a seller&#039;s account that will be refunded to you after you have demonstrated that you are an asset to the Silk Road vendor community.

				It&#039;s a good policy to have, most people coming here just hoping to scam a few bucks as a vendor are now not going to want to put up the $500 deposit. Meaning less scammers, meaning a better market for buyers which in the end will likely mean more sales for vendors since people will feel more secure when making purchases. Win win for everybody on the site, and if you&#039;re going to sell on here 500 is not a very large investment. Most sellers probably make that back in their first month.

				If your worried about a little $500 deposit, then your not fit enough to have a vendor profile. <br />You never get that deposit back, those $500 dollars just enable a vendor account, giving you an opportunity to make as much as you possibly can..... which is a great deal dude. <br />plus, if you know what you are doing, those $500 mean nothing..<br /><br /><br />My Vendor Profile:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/822595b9a3<br />

				I remember when vendor accounts were free.&nbsp; The thinking back then, oh, a little more than a year ago, was that drug users would use vendor accounts to get rid of drugs they had too much of, and SR would be like a drug swap meet of sorts.&nbsp; Then somebody threatened to send poison, and DPR started mandatory fees of $150 to get a vendor account.&nbsp; And now, I am surprised as you to hear an additional $500 deposit.&nbsp; Pretty soon, a vendor account might cost you almost $1000!

				Ya california, it was only $150 for me to open up a vendor account. That poisoning threat sounds scary... :( <br />Hopefully it does raise to $1000 soon, so that it is only people that mean business.

				I heard it was $150 as well, unless prices have skyrocketed in the last couple of months!<br />It does seem a bit much, but when you consider the folks at SR have gone to unbelievable lengths to provide this service, not to mention the costs they incur etc...<br />One can understand...They are trying to make money just like the rest! If you are a good, trustworthy vendor you should be able to make 500 back in no time!<br /><br />Luck to all!
