				I was eating pie but it was not pizza or any food item. It&#039;s really akward when you go down on a girl and then find out she has a serious odor/taste problem. Needless to say foreplay was short.

				I was not eating a pizza, though I was eating something very much like a pizza, which was fried egg and tomato sandwich and hash browns. Upon reflection, I will say that&#039;s actually not very much like a pizza at all. But thanks for letting me share!
