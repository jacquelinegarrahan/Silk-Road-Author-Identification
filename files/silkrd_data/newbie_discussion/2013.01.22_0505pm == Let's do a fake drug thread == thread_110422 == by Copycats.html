				Adrenochrome from Fear and Loathing in Las vegas, you know this one might be real I have no idea, I always felt it was metaphorical for taking what hunter s. thompson called a &#039;black hit of acid&quot; which was like the horrible introspective nightmare he described when examining America at the time and the Nixon administration, not much has changed since then lol. Taking too much was apparently like having one hell of a prolonged bad acid trip or shroom trip. If I am wrong here please feel free to correct me as i am reading f+l on the campaign trail 72&#039; and not f+l in las vegas right now so i don&#039;t know exactly what he was talking about straight from my memory of the movie

				lols for peanuts making it more potent, alright moving on.... <br /><br />red-eye from the first episode of Cowboy Bebop = apparently an extremely high concentrate of cocaine and amphetamine derivatives, it&#039;s effects would slow down a person&#039;s perception of time making the character in the episode have intense reflexes which he used to kill all the mobsters coming after him to get back all the red-eye he stole, great episode

				Ok, since i just did Red-Eye i&#039;ve got to do Slo-Mo from the new Judge Dredd movie, a lot like Red-Eye in that it would slow time down, in fact there were a lot of slowed bullet-time like sequences in Dredd that they just straight ripped from Cowboy Bebop.<br /><br />Anyway the difference being that slo-mo would not make you super strong like with no pain and the incredible reflexes did not come along, in fact in Dredd inhaling the drug seemed to make your ability to fight or dodge bullets less so.... lol, funny scenes in that movie<br /><br />you know what the best part of that new Dredd movie is? Rob Schnieder isn&#039;t in it, didn&#039;t really miss Stallone either, and thank god hollywood has finally figured out we are not going to have flying cars and motorcycles in the future, if you just do some simple physics calculations you&#039;ll realize that shit wastes a massive amount of energy in comparision to having a light, perhaps made of carbon fiber, vehicle with wings...<br /><br />making it an airplane or helicopter, not flying cars

				Alright this one is real because I&#039;m still trying to think of some other ones off the top of my head, it&#039;s a real drug but very rare never seen it on SR <br /><br />it&#039;s called beetlenut(sp?) just a plant that grows on some islands in the pacific I think, you chew the nuts you find in the plant, 8th graders lol to chewing on nuts gets you high, alright I&#039;m digressing again, you chew on the leaves and nuts..... *stifles laugh* but i don&#039;t know what the effects are other than it makes your entire face numb like some good blow would, and considering beetlenut grows in tropical climate I&#039;m not surprised it has cocaine like attributes to it, i would say lets get some on SR but I don&#039;t think thats a good idea, from a tree-hugging environmentalist perspective, beetlenut is rare because it&#039;s apparently out in the middle of nowhere, where only the native tribals villagers can enjoy it :)

				alright i gotta do this but i do apologize, video game reference made me think of all the drugs in fallout 3, lets start with Nuka-Cola Quantum!<br /><br />Not sure exactly how they explained how it felt, drinking it apparently was like a super dose of caffeine while getting punched as hard as you can in the stomach and afterwards you could see in the dark for a few hours. you know I don&#039;t care how bad the programming or graphics was in that game the writing from bethesda has always been pretty good imo

				In the book Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, a film called Infinite Jest is meant to be so addictive that people end up watching it and not leaving their TV rooms, eventually dying.<br /><br />Not a drug as such but interesting concept. (It&#039;s not a horror thing).<br /><br />That book was written long before SR existed - interest to flick back through it now again (poly drug use all throughout it).<br /><br />Yes that film Limitless was interesting too. I&#039;d love to try a drug like that.
