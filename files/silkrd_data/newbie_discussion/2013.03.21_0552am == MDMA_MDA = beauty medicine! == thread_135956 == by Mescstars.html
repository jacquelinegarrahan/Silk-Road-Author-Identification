				Alright I&#039;ve been meaning to share my experiences of pure Mdma/Mda. first off I would like to say that pure Mdma has been like medicine to me when taken at appropriate doses.it has given me complete relief from Arthritis! and so far as long as I take Mdma at least once a month my arthritis symptoms disappear. this is completely fantastic!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;no more do I need to take Ibprofen,Tylenol or such things.&nbsp; in my research I&#039;ve discovered that Mdma increases cortisol in the body by 800% http://www.ergo-log.com/xtccortisol.html<br />another awesome thing I find Mdma/Mda does for me is that it makes me look more beautiful, yes it makes my physical appearance more appealing and youthful, and I feel healed and cleansed inside and out.&nbsp; I feel and look more attractive dynamic and electric. but of course the euphoric effects of Mdma due to the serotonin release are what all enjoy the most about this magic substance!<br />Mdma just makes me deeply relax into a dreamy peace and love and forget my cares for several hours while at the same time it equips me with psychological insights and knowledge about myself and my problems on how to best confront issues and things needing to be taken care of. in this respect I find Mdma is a teacher as well as a healer.<br />Now lets hear some other stories how has Mdma benefited you and what do you most love about it?

				MDMA for me has always been that love drug that interconnects everyone together...<br />Having used it at Burning Man with the masses, I felt a connection with the collective group/mind.

				Poly, yes Mdma is the love drug, but Molly&#039;s older sister MDA is even a stonger love drug as far as the erotic goes!&nbsp; &nbsp;recently I tried mixing 90mg of MDA with about 400mg of pure Cacao powder and man it completely changed the MDA into a totally Mescaline/ Mdma like feel to it , simply awesome combo.&nbsp; pure chocolate powder potentiates the Phenyls incredibly well. also<br />I found the theobromine in the Cacao powder cut out the speedy effects such as heart tarchadiyas, it dilates the blood vessals. in other words it reduces any vasoconstriction from the amphetamine. and if you mix a tiny bit of 2CB up to 15mg&nbsp; you&#039;re in for a cool trip almost like Mescaline.
