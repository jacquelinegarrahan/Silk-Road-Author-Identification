				I installed tails to a usb, and am running it on a laptop with a fully encrypted windows OS. I have to say, I absolutely love tails, I&#039;ve been messing around with the pgp client and the key manager and they are awesome, and it seems like there are just so many great tools built in. but is tails encrypted? i know i can create encrypted volumes on the remaining space, but is FDE possible with tails usb? Normally, when i start windows, I have the truecrypt boot loader appear and only can access my system with my password. I&#039;m wondering if anyone knows a way to achieve a similar result on my usb? I&#039;d like to be able to only access this usb if i have a password. and also, I read that truecrypt encrypts all of your data, including the traffic sent to and from your computer. is this possible with some linux based encryption software, and if yes, is it difficult? im a n00b to tails, and not super tech savvy :/ but im also not completely inept. i love a project and learning new things about computers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />is this article pointing me in the right direction? <br />http://www.infosecramblings.com/backtrack/backtrack-5-bootable-usb-thumb-drive-with-full-disk-encryption/

				TAILS doesn&#039;t use you hard drive, it only uses your RAM and everything it puts on your RAM is encrypted, I also think that if you choose to save things on your USB while on TAILS, the data you save is encrypted by default, or you can encrypt it using the built in softwares. To switch to your main OS, you have to reboot. I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d want a password to go on TAILS since the only data would be the TAILS OS.. I think the encryption tool from TAILS allows you to create a locked USB but I&#039;m not sure, I&#039;m not a TAILS expert.

				You are perfectly safe using Tails. Just RTFM (Read the fucking manual) I would also suggest you run tails live from CD while browsing and run the USB version when your ready to purchase. Just make sure EVERYTHING is up to date. I personally set up tails for my friends and make sure they get a new disk every time it is updated.
