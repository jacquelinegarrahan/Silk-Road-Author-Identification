				As a result of the &quot;never FE&quot; thread i thought it might be a good if those that experienced great vendors could list them here.<br />Imo,FE should not be so common or even forbidden.<br />When you end up in resolution this is mostly negative for the buyer as this goes on his rep also.<br /><br />So dear buyers,if you have had a good experience with legit vendors in the non-FE sense please let us know here.

				I assume it also has an effect how much you are buying. If you are a first time buyer and want to purchase an eight of weed I assume a lot of vendors would be fine without FE.<br /><br />I dont think too many vendors would be fine without FE on a QP however. Dunno!

				if you&#039;re a brand new buyer you should just start off buying a gram of weed/hash here and there to boost your purchase stats without spending too much btc/risk getting ripped off.<br />also look for domestic vendors first .<br />if you actually talk to vendors (they&#039;re people too, not vending machines),<br />and build up a good business relationship with those whose stuff you prefer you will get the best experience out of sr

				When I first got started I just bought low cost legal items from smoking paraphernalia vendors, I bought just for the sake of it to get my first 5 down so big vendors wouldnt fuck me over on large orders but I actually found some pretty sweet products in the end..<br /><br />My favorite is a limited edition Cheech &amp; Chong grinder i got from Alter The Ego was like 0.05BTC or some shit but it actually does the job and no risk of being seized in the post so a good place to start for first time buyers. <br /><br />Just pm some of the vendors and get talking I offered to FE for K from Symbiosis, Marcelketman and Project4 none of them needed me too.. just break the ice with a message first.<br /><br />See it this way if you are a vendor and you get an order with someone who has little or no stats your first thoughts are scammer? So just start conversation with these people that is the best way.. I dont think any real good vendors need FE unless its a large quantity..

				Yes indeed ,good communication is key.<br />I found that most vendors that have a good trackrecord are very fair and indeed don&#039;t demand FE.<br /><br />Do your rechearch about a vendor you think about doing business with the forum.That really is the first step to not get scammed.<br />

				I&#039;ve been eyeing HighSupply for some MDMA pills, but all of their international orders require FE. They seem to have a good reputation, but that seems a little extreme to require that for all of us not in the UK or EU, doesn&#039;t it? Kind of disappointed, as there&#039;s a shortage of pill vendors with bigger orders of pills that aren&#039;t SuperTrips, XTCExpress, or located in the Netherlands.

				Im in the UK and ordered 1000 beans from highsupply and hes asked me to FE. I find this strange as even though his profile says &quot;UK full escrow&quot;.
