				People say not to finalize early, but if you are a new buyer and have no feedback I believe nearly all vendors require it especially as large of orders that I&#039;m making. What are your thoughts?

You might find a vendor that will work with you through escrow. You should read the buyers guide. It advises against FE. It does seem to be common for established vendors to require new buyers to FE though. It&#039;s a contradiction I know. Check the age of the vendors account, the number of fans, their feedback, their satisfaction and rating, and their forum review thread. If a vendor has a good track record, good feedback, good reviews here in the forum, and no scam threads, you should be fine. Same risk handing over money first on the street, dealer: &quot;I&#039;ll be right back&quot;, lol.

				There are actually plenty of vendors out there who support new members and will not require them to FE ever!&nbsp; All you have to do is look around and you&#039;ll find them I promise.&nbsp; They are not mythological creatures or anything.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; And once you find a few you like, become a fan so you can have them bookmarked on your welcome page.&nbsp; And, they can tell you made them a favorite.&nbsp; This will def get you some bonus points with em.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do not FE.&nbsp; Ever!!!&nbsp; Be smart!!&nbsp; Its there to protect you AND the sellers.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Well i finalized early anyway. I cant find the price/amount that I need from other vendors so I took the risk. I&#039;m not too concerned about it. If someone is willing to burn their reputation over 1300bux that would be pretty lame.

				If it&#039;s a top 1-5% vendor, than I really wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Anyone in question, no way, don&#039;t FE.
