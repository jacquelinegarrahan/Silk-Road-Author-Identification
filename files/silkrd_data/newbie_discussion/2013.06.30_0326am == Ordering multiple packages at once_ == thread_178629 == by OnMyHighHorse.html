				Is this a serious no-no or is there minimal increased risk when doing so?

				Define minimal.<br /><br />Are packages coming from overseas? Do they require FE or signature? What quantities? What items?

				What about 2 small packages at once?&nbsp; Just the 2, and then I probably won&#039;t be ordering again for awhile, if ever.&nbsp; Honestly, waiting and hoping for them to arrive safely is the most nerve-wracking experience of my life, and I&#039;m not sure I can do it again.&nbsp; It&#039;s like waiting for the results of an HIV test after having unprotected sex with some sleazeball.&nbsp; It&#039;s my first time and I&#039;m terrified.<br /><br />

				The question is whether USPS (or whoever) checks to see when your last package passed through their sort center and whether they do anything about that. Just think of all the small businesses that ship and/or receive things all day long with only their name on the package. With the sheer volume of packages the USPS or whoever handle, I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s anything to be concerned about.

				With the amount of shit that gets mailed all the time, it seems unlikely to matter. Unless of course it&#039;s packaged really poorly or reeks of drugs I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned.<br /><br />(NB: I am a noob, too.)

				Small packages are usually fine in pairs of 2.&nbsp; People tend to order things online in small waves.
