				So I&#039;ve known about the road for around 3 months now. I&#039;ve been on the forums actively for about a week. <br /><br />I am looking for any tips or advice experienced road users may be able to offer to me.<br /><br />I want to have as close to 100% confidence as I can when I place my first order. I don&#039;t want to be one of those individuals who gets compromised from some simple mistake I may have overlooked. Any insight experienced users may be able to drop to me would be very much appreciated. <br /><br />Are you using tails on an encrypted USB drive? Do you get orders to a drop addy or a living addy? Etc.

				Welcome on board! Choosing the right seller is so important when you have no buyer stats. You will probably be expected to finalise early, so make sure the seller has high ratings and has been around for a long time.&nbsp; When it comes to price, if it looks too good to be true then it probably is.&nbsp; My first few orders were domestic so I didn&#039;t have to worry about customs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always used my real name and address.<br /><br />Look through the forums there are lots of great tips for first timers.

				Yeah along with what he said ^<br />don&#039;t stress out too much depending on what your country of origin is - small amounts of drugs that get caught by customs just get thrown out<br />Im from Aus - infamously strict customs<br />I&#039;ve had near 30 transactions and only 1 hasn&#039;t made it through<br /><br />Always order small amounts to ensure no consequences - worst that can happen is you wont get it. Not too bad <br />I use some sort of variation of my name for domestic and my real name for international - less conspicuous for customs<br />As long as you&#039;re not ordering a kg of cocaine or something - youll be good!

				Something I got burned on was a vendor not having sold the product I was ordering for the last few weeks..I like to see that there is feedback from the last few days for the same item..sometimes disreputable vendors will sell things they dont have in stock..then they play this oh it was sent game, and you are looking in your mailbox everyday thinking ...uh where is it? <br /><br />And of course...try to NEVER FE..unless it is an amount you can afford to lose..I know there are vendors that will sell to noobs without requiring FE..so find one.

				-Check the buyers&#039; feedback on the forum. High rating doesn&#039;t always mean high-quality service.<br />-Don&#039;t rely on the feedback on the vendor&#039;s profile. Always check the forums for reliable reviews.<br />-Don&#039;t order big quantities or many orders simultaneously. <br />-Use your real name and address, fakes are a big red flag<br />-Order express only if you REALLY need to. Express packages are triple-checked and are looked at much more to ensure they get to the right place in the right condition. Regular or priority is the way to go. <br />-Don&#039;t sign for packages unless there is no other shipping option<br />-Do not use TOR to check tracking.<br />-Use PGP if possible to send your address details<br />-Don&#039;t send BTC directly from an account that states your name or other credentials<br />-If you encounter the LE, keep your cool, clean your house of any drugs, paraphernalia, clean your PC of any evidence and most importantly, YOU DID NOT ORDER ANYTHING, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS IN THE PACKAGE OR WHERE IT COMES FROM<br /><br />That&#039;s everything I can think about. As long as you follow these steps, you will be fine :) Good luck.

				Deepinblu has it right. It boils down largely to common sense. Stick with vendors with great feedback. Just read, read and then read some more. Eventually, you will know which vendor feels right. Start off with a smaller order, and then after you begin to feel some trust you can always increase the order size.

				Read the reviews of the vendors your choosing from but also search them out of the forums as well. Look to see if their has been any issues with product quality or shipping. Most of all be patient with the mail cause the postal service likes to play with themselves and take forever especially for your first purchase off SR it seems.

				I would advise to use PGP encryption when sending your address. You can receive the package at your address as long as there is not enough in the shipment that will make LE come after you. Always take your time and investigate vendors scrupulously. Make sure that not every single person is FE&#039;ing for a vendor. Look back in that case and see when was the last time someone actually received a package and updated feedback. If it is all more than 1 week and it all isn&#039;t international orders, you know something is up. Good luck buddy.

				Thanks CaptainSnowFlakes!<br /><br />Yeah I got the PGP down pact with GPG4USB. My first planned order isn&#039;t very large at all I would say. I have been looking into one vendor in particular, and they don&#039;t require FE.

				My suggestions as a newbie (a lot has been mentioned already, and feel free to challenge me on the stuff that hasn&#039;t)<br /><br />Before buying<br /><br />- Read read and read the forums, get a feel for how it works obviously, things to watch out for, how the resolution process works etc. I found the wiki&#039;s buyers guide pretty light and resorted to searching for guides on the forum. Even read the sellers discussions to understand their side and DPR&#039;s philosophy posts to understand what it is you&#039;re signing up to<br />- Get PGP and use the test threads / facilities, there&#039;s website with an automatic service listed somewhere where you can practice encrypting and decrypting all day long<br />- Read all around the security stuff. I completely missed that accessing Mtgox from Tor will be flagged by them, and if the layer upon layer of protection (truecrypt partion, running off a USB etc) sound like paranoia to casual browsers at first, you&#039;ll wish you&#039;d followed those set up rules properly the more you get into it<br />- Similarly keep usernames / passwords separate across everything. You&#039;ll end up signing up to a lot of different services (building your Darknet persona I guess). You&#039;ll have trouble remembering them all if you&#039;re keeping them unique and lengthy enough not to crack, so find a creative way to record them if needed. (not in one handy to read text file on your desktop!) <br />- Read the product-specific testing / opinion threads. I was ready to jump straight in and order from the best that was on sale at the time, until I found the names of recommended sellers who didn&#039;t have active listings at the time and so decided to wait<br />- Narrow your seller selection down to a few, and read their review threads. Look for the recent posts (I was about to hit purchase on an item until I noticed others commenting that the seller gone AWOL for over 2 weeks). Also try to make sure you&#039;re reading reviews about the particular product you want to buy from them. 5/5 seller feedback on the main site might be about something else.<br />- Give it some time from sign up before ordering, I might be wrong but sellers will look at buyer stats and might be unsure of someone ordering on the first day<br />- Feel free to send a message to the seller, but don&#039;t take issue with it if it&#039;s not read. At least you&#039;ll get a feel for the customer service level (maybe a hangover from days of buying face-to-face, but while buying goods here can be like shopping on faceless Amazon, given the nature of them I think it&#039;s preferable to build a relationship)<br />- Don&#039;t try to buy 5 small safe items to get past the newbie perception, it doesn&#039;t make a seller trust you more (a misconception I had at first)<br />- Slightly contentious, but I wouldn&#039;t even worry about ordering something relatively expensive the first time. You&#039;ll get scammed less often on smaller items, but positive first buys don&#039;t equal any more security when you do come to bigger purchases, it completely depends on the seller<br /><br />Buying bitcoins<br /><br />- A few of the main guides recommend the same process (I initially opened up a Mtgox account until I saw the latest threads on it). Also it might not be the best option for your country. In the end I found one that was quicker, gave a better exchange rate and looked less suspicious as an outgoing payment<br />- I&#039;d recommend (though this could be purely speculation) to wash your bitcoin extremely thoroughly the first time. A first time outgoing sum to an new recipient may trigger more red flags with the bank than if it&#039;s been done before<br /><br />Ordering<br /><br />- I&#039;d say order from a big and recognized seller the first time (98+ rating or so). They&#039;ve got the process down and can easily answer questions (even the big sellers aren&#039;t too busy to respond).<br />- See if you can find one that is willing not to FE on first orders. There are big sellers that don&#039;t.<br />- Order domestic. The added challenges of international customs means that if it does get lost in transit, you haven&#039;t written off the idea of travelling the road entirely.<br />- Try a few different suppliers if you&#039;re curious, but then compare your feedback to others on the forum so you&#039;ll get a feel for who&#039;s opinion you can trust<br />- Always use PGP, request the seller&#039;s key if it&#039;s not publicly listed. Any decent seller doesn&#039;t really have a reason not to use it, even if it&#039;s only for your satisfaction<br /><br />After ordering<br /><br />- You will worry about it the minute you hit order. Did I pick the right seller? Will it be the best product? Did I pay too much? Did I do everything correctly? You start analyzing all the possible ways in which it could fail given the risks involved. It is weird the first time, but have faith and you will be rewarded<br />- Post a review on the forums, they&#039;re always useful even there&#039;s little detail, it just shows the seller is running their business ok. Be mindful you&#039;re not giving away stealth techniques / any other incriminating evidence

				Versace,<br />Do you mind stating what country are you located? I would suggest to only order domestically for the first purchases. You should receive it within around 3 days from the time it gets put into the PO. You will not be required to FE since most international orders require FE. Plus, you will have a good time frame and you won&#039;t get all wigged out waiting for your package lol.

Plus, you will have a good time frame and you won&#039;t get all wigged out waiting for your package lol.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In the US of A!&nbsp; :D
