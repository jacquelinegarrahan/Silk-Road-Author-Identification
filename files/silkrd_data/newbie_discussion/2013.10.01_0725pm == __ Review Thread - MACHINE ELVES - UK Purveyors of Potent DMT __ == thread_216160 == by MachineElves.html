				Hello to each and every one of you on the Silk Road.&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />* * Kudos and LUV to you all * *&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />The purpose of this thread is to allow members to discuss our product, their interaction with us and also (if they wish!) what experiences they encountered with our product.<br /><br />We are VERY proud of our DMT, it&#039;s extremely POTENT and indeed medicinal, for many people with troubles or addictions.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />To help share this miraculous molecule (and make some BTC!! of course) is our PURPOSE.<br /><br />We treat everyone exactly as we would like to be treated ours&quot;elves&quot;&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Please leave your feedback, comments, suggestions and reviews in this thread!!&nbsp; (We will add kudos to all who post, regardless of content)<br /><br />Example reviews received to date (Buyer Names Removed):<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great, perfect and on time as always<br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast and Professional.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was brilliant, sellers communication was excellent informing me when my order was dispatched and the delivery time which was fantastic. Stealth was above par haha. Product looks great, have not tested but assured its the real deal thanks again!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing!!! ego death, Machine elves I experienced them or me? there like a mirror of self arrrgh words fail.........Smooth the come up of this product Smoooooooth gradual like you melt away, nice taste too. Twice ive hit on this and broke through.. life will never be the same again and i love it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/10 beautiful stealth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My no.1<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received order quickly, excellent stealth, great comms, get a cool vibe from this vendor, not tried product yet<br />unrated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no review<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fantastic seller, received the very next day.. this is my 2nd time ordering dmt from this guy, and will be back again<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely gobsmacked!! Brilliant stealth, delivery, price and product. This is my 2nd order (500mg this time) from the Machine Elves and was generously overweight :-))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be taking this later tonight with some buddies that I am introducing to DMT ;-))<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they get even half of the ride I had last time, expect far more orders in the very near future!!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/5 on everything, especially quality and the communication throughout.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fantastic, quick delivery, havent used the product yet but will update once i have<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good stuff. Weight is bang on / slightly over. I didn&#039;t break through but I was FUCKED UP at the time (benzos) and I came really close. I&#039;m going to do it properly next time (on a weekend, no intoxicants before, eating right, brief meditation) and I&#039;m almost positive that 50mg will make me see the machine elves.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically... this vendor is selling the good stuff. I&#039;m going to buy more as soon as I can get hold of some more BTC. The price is great too (the best in the UK even, based on the quality?)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#039;re on the fence - don&#039;t be. Just do it.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really helpful vendors, took the time to answer a number of questions I had.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next day delivery and no worries on stealth etc!<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great fast and stealth delivery. Haven&#039;t tried the product yet (looks good though), but their profile and the nice correspondence I had with the vendor, including some good tips on how the use the product, show a very honest attitude to what they sell. Recommended!<br />unrated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no review<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great quality , fast delivery and excellent stealth what else can you ask.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried just small 15mg dose and had me tripping balls so its strong stuff.If you like to trip but dont like all the long acid trippy types of drugs you will like DMT. Its fast acting and has a short but very very potent experience.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very nice dmt, it did send my buddy to the moon and back safely.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and hope to chat with many of you over time....&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES
