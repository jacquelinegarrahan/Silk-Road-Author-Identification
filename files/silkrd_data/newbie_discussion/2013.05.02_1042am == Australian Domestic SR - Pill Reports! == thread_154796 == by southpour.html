				Hey All,<br /><br />Post all experiences with pills available on SR - Australian Domestic<br /><br />Try to keep it current, no point reminiscing about pills people cannot obtain - However keep in mind peoples listing expire, the site has been down a few days and plenty of pills will be re-listed once vendors get a chance. Plenty to talk about.<br /><br />It will be interesting to hear what people have to say about what they have tried, which vendors are good to do business with and anything else we feel is relevant. Happy for people to use this thread to get their posts up, keep it sensible I am sure plenty of new SR users have a thing or two to contribute! The newbie section could do with some good quality discussion...<br /><br />So drop by and have your say, the feedback will be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />SP

				SP,<br /><br />AUS DOM pills are generally the worst pills worldwide (Except for NZ hehehehe).<br /><br />But seriously 100mg is a rocker in Aus and 250 mg in EU. <br /><br />Enough said.

				Domestic pills are hit and miss, buy Molly, you know its going to be MDMA - measure it up (100 - 200mg per hit) and cap your own pills. Plenty of good domestic vendors selling it.&nbsp;

				Ok, you may find this interesting based on your opinion above<br /><br />Green Ninja Turtles<br /><br />Tidy press in the shape of a ninja turtle head, a few flecks but mostly green, no score, nice smell - definitely a very professional job.<br /><br />It has been a fair while since I have had a decent MDxx pressed pill, plenty of MD powders. What these had going over the powder is they are around the 120mg mark, possibly higher so a 10pk vs 1gm is better value (supposedly lab tested, and I would put them around that mark based on my trails). Basically 1200mg vs 800mg of most MD available on SR domestically.<br /><br />My friend took them in halves and said they were the strongest and most enjoyable pill she has had in about 2 years - I know she has not had anything all that great for a long while but did have 120mg of some MDxx crystals (assume 80% purity approx). So in comparison her vote goes to the turtles.<br /><br />Now my opinion on these is similar, I think they offer better value than the MD powders. Definitely a bit of kick to them, unfortunately I had too much to drink which does make it hard to accurately grade. When I do have another dip I will be mindful of this and put a little more feedback, not that I can&#039;t already say they a very decent pingers.<br /><br />Link to pillreports below for those interested. I do hope these get listed again because I do intend to procure a few more, definitely a lot better than I had been getting off the road.<br /><br />http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=31514

				Thats the thing, I had 3 of them and it was ok but nothing special. Once you have had the Defcons, Powerbutons or Nintendos their is no going back to domestic or any pill not originating from Holland&nbsp; mate, just go with Molly domestically

However on the road there are plenty of vendors with a few things of interest.<br /><br />I was tossing up between Red Nazi&#039;s, Green Ninja Turtles, Grey CK&#039;s Beige Bicardi/Batmans, Green Question Marks,&nbsp; - I opted for the Turtles which did not disappoint but I am still fairly curious about the others especially the Nazi&#039;s and Green Question Marks.<br /><br />Also you should consider my theory on the 80% purity of 1000mg vs decent quality pills containing upwards from 100mg - if lab tested this result will be 100mg @ 100% rather than 100mg @ 80% which is 80mg haha. Obviously you can&#039;t be sure of the lab testing but for smaller importers I assume this is what their vendor is telling them, you will see this if you see vendors from the Netherlands selling Nintendos or something else crazy at 300mg - lucky bastards! haha

I am not against molly at all, I just stand by my theory of value for money - sometimes it will be there other times not really. Believe me I have had plenty of molly, its been the only way to fly rather than taking a punt on most local rubbish.<br /><br />I obtained some local &quot;Red 13&#039;s&quot; - now these are typical of what I get offered off the road, complete rubbish and yes molly wins hands down. However this is not always the case, I had a stockpile of white hearts a few years back (now they were quality)

				3 Turtles over the pace of about 2 hours, O.K but nothing special was my opinion of them. I would guess around 80mg of MDMA.

				Although I haven&#039;t bought any pills yet I have done some sussing out and I think those question marks are around 130-150mg? Correct me if I&#039;m wrong. I&#039;d probably go with those over anything but I have a mega tolerance to MDMA.

Like I said a friend of mine took in halves, that would make it 40mg that isn&#039;t even threshold for a first time user. They are definitely over 100mg, there are a couple of reports if you search pillreports worldwide, one claiming 120mg, seller on SR claimed 130mg - hard to say but my bet is over 100mg<br /><br />If your tolerance is high, don&#039;t space them out - either bomb a couple at once or PLUG THEM hahaha

				Thought I would just have a quick look at the current offerings. Grey CK&#039;s, Yellow Cupids &amp; FUK&#039;s, not really excited about any of these but would love to hear from anyone who has consumed these pills in AUS!<br /><br />I am sure a few users are able to comment, they have been around awhile so I would expect at least a few first hand experiences with these!

				Agree on your point regarding $&#039;s SP. Generally pills are better value that Molly @ 2btc for a gram as long as you are getting 100mg or more.<br /><br />Agree on e fact that Aus street pills are shite and there is only AUS DOM rubbish on SR ATM. Waiting for some decent pillz to com back on or I will be buying overpriced Molly&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />&nbsp;<br />Oh I remember the days of white splits and Doves or the original mitsys from 1998.<br /><br />Been doing MDMA for a little while&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Cheers Adz

				SR provides options for sure. An opportunity to make an informed decision about what you are buying.<br /><br />Sure we can complain about the disparity between Australian pills and what you might be able to acquire in Europe/USA and there is not much that can be done about that BUT at least SR helps to level it out a bit, offering more variety, honest opinions and delivery to your door haha <br /><br />Beats being pushed junk from someone who flogs of a different dud batch each week

				Hey SP,<br /><br />Looks like it&#039;s only us from AUS in the Newbies.<br /><br />Earlier this year I bought a couple to Nintendos from an Aus vendor and they were crackers. Definately the EU ones. But still not as good as the old days, I often consider whether it is my brain chemistry has changed or whether the MDMA being produced now is different?<br /><br />Generally in 1990&#039;s the MDMA was energising whereas now it is very Heavy. WHat do you think? I have read that the MDMA synthesis being used now is different to then.<br /><br />Cheers

I took them anyway and 3 pills in one hour and I didnt even peak. They were active but must have been low dose. <br />Im getting Ninja Turtles soon which are the UK imports which Ill test to make sure the simmons reagent is still working. And Ill not have any Valium or Benzo&#039;s or other drugs to blunt the high. Perhaps the Pacmans are good pills but I have very high tolerance and had Valium in my system so I dont want to claim they are fake or duds. Ive never had a pill without a simmons reaction before though so I would be sus about being &quot;told&quot; they are MDMA.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />BUNK Pillz man, AUS DOM pillz are crap. I only buy imports and even then AUS only get tthe SHite imports, all the good ones are generally sold domestically in EU.

However it could have something to do with what is being sold MDMA. I am not familiar with how accurate these lab tests people talk about, can they identify analogs of MDMA or do they just pick up MDXX? I really don&#039;t know.<br /><br />I do notice that with decent MD pills these days I definitely feel more munted compared to my first few experiences which I experience significantly more euphoria and empathy. I cannot remember getting eye wobbles from the first few pills I ever had, and if i did they were much less pronounced than they are these days. Eye wobbles pretty much go hand in hand with any decent strength MD pill these days, all part of munting out haha<br /><br />It could be just me, but I also never see people taking pills or MDMA for the first time displaying signs of euphoria or even empathy. This may be just because I am old, and less likely to run into these inexperienced rollers. Who knows

				SP,<br /><br />The tests do not pick up individual analogues they just show MD## as a positive result.<br /><br />I think a lot has to do with our brains. I have recently only just come back to MDMA after a few years off and my first dose after the break was amazing. But not as good as my first time, I remember have eye wiggles going way back to my first dose as well as previous doses. However I still had massive energy as well as being munted, sounds strange but true.

				Still nothing to really report on unfortunately. Was hoping to at least see the nazi, ? and ninja turtles back for sale. <br /><br />Not sure if the fluctuating bitcoin is making vendors reluctant to list at the moment. I do believe I had an order cancelled due to this reason, not that the vendor would admit to this!! Hope the slim picking do not go on much longer
