				I just order a custom ID and FE&#039;d from Ted Danzing.<br /><br />Has anyone used him and do you have a review? How long should I expect to wait... Does he contact you when he sends it out or does it just arrive at your door.<br /><br />

				Hey, I&#039;m a new vendor on the site and I&#039;m just curious as to why he and other ID vendors are charging such a high rate for an ID?<br />$200? That&#039;s ridiculous.

				Got it.<br /><br />I am pretty pissed. You can easily tell at first glance that the holo is a sticker. I am not sure on other ID&#039;s if the holo is a sticker (real ones) but it is 100% obvious, you can see the edges of the ID which are not laminated.<br /><br />+ was very badly cropped. From the top of my head to the top of the photo is about 1/2 of it, the other half is from the top of my head down. I look tiny. I thought this was because of the picture I took and that it must of sucked, but looking at my photo there is only a very small amount of space between the top of my head and the top of the photo. I don&#039;t understand why there would be so much in the cropped image. I compared this to the display ID Ted has, and the picture on mine is terrible.<br /><br />On the back of the ID two letters are bleeding, this could very well be a give away if you are attempting to get into a night club.<br /><br />The experation date is also 1 year short of when it should be<br /><br />I must have gotten a lemon, I can not see how people are giving Ted such great reviews. <br /><br />Does anyone know how I can find an ID scanner online to see if the ID scans.<br /><br />I am not sure what I am going to do, any advice?

				I was looking at pictures of real ohios and it seems that the sticker placed on with the visible border replicates the real ohios atleast this is what i could tell from the online photos. The back bleeding shouldn&#039;t be a huge problem.<br /><br />The picture is just terrible though. (blurry, it looks like the camera is looking down on me. In the real photo the camera is exactly straight to my face 1 to 1) I am going to contact Ted when he comes back and see if he is willing to help me out. <br /><br />Up to then I will just be really carefull about where I use it
