				Green, shrooms, alcohol and a lot of Nicotine. Tried the white snow, speed, extasy and Benzos. For the snow the down come was not worth the high, from speed I got nothing, extasy made me way to emotional and the Benzos I hated them (got them on prescription for sleeping problems)<br /><br />So I will stay green and shroomy, never tried opiats but maybe something to try out in the future

				100% Lysergic acid diethylamide! <br /><br />Used to be weed, then there was MDMA, then i overdid the MDMA - cant stand it anymore - there was a time when I was eating 10 pills in a night. Then I got really into xanax and my life took a terrible turn. If you abuse benzos you can and will loose EVERYTHING in your life. Then there was a period of sobriety followed by lots of ketmine. Once I started noticing issues with my urinary tract I am 100% an LSD fanatic. It really is helping me to keep my life in balance. If you are into benzos or anything destructive like that then I would suggest taking 4 tabs of some good L and open your mind&#039;s eye to the futility of your life - attempting to numb and sedate your senses and emotions when really you could be enhancing them.

				greens all the time, went through my self destructing c phase, enjoy real mdma, but overdid it with probably not mdma, love the mushroom, and occasional opiate. I figure I better save my opiate tolerance for later in life. I don&#039;t like pain. also yet to try lsd. started off a little rough with benzos but I think i&#039;ve got that pretty much under control and low dose. just need to wean off eventually<br /><br />to think of it, really the C and to a small degree benzo threw me off my already off-beaten course . wish I would have handled those better

				I always wondered how LSD is compared to shrooms (In my fantasy I think they are comparable). Never had the chance to try the acid, but now, being on the Road there is the possibility and I would be glad someone could give me a little hind.

				Heroin (and all high powered opiates) and Cocaine. Benzos are great to potentiate the high of any opiates or to help come down from the gnarly/stimulating shit.&nbsp; Those are my top 3 in order of preference but i love all kindsa other&nbsp; good shit too.

				Mostly just weed. I do not think I am that comfortable with using psychedelics and dissociatives as I very much like not having my senses completely overwhelmed. Opiates, benzos, most definitely staying away from, do not like that life destroying addiction potential. Same for crack, cocaine and meth, although I will admit I am intrigued by stimulants and am contemplating playing with ephedrine as it does not seem to be as potentially horrendous as the other stims. As for MDMA..not really sure. Contemplating trying it, but definitely starting out at very, very low doses to begin with.

				Naturally produced hormones and endorphins from things that make my life special - like getting into a little airplane and and seeing a view of the great smokey mountains from above with a perfect sunset, skirting cloud formations, or diving a coral reef in the keys filled with the psychedelic wonders of life.&nbsp; Of course a nice toke of green and a taste of my girl moll with the above is great, but its the natural highs that are the best for me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any kids yet but I hope someday to have that....

				LSD tops it off for me because it&#039;s so fucking potent, spiritual, inconspicuous, it lasts 12 hours, and it has a great culture surrounding it. <br /><br />Bud, of course, is great. Who doesn&#039;t love to smoke/vape/eat edibles?? Noone I know =)<br /><br />Alcohol is another favorite of mine because it&#039;s great for social situations. Nobody wants to talk to me when I&#039;m tripping and freaking about how corrupt the government is or when I&#039;m naked doing yoga. When I&#039;m drunk though, I become more sociable and funny. <br /><br />MDMA is great of course, but I get that &quot;rush&quot; feeling without rolling. I can feel the neurotoxicity so I just end up selling it to my friends and not doing too much of it. It is awesome, especially for dancing and raves. <br /><br />I stay away from all opiates and most pills. Might try propanolol for those performance situations. I dabble with adderall for studying. It works pretty well for that.

				I smoke weed every day, just like Howard Marks - Dre told me to!<br /><br />I love MDMA, shrooms, and ACIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!<br /><br />Best acid I ever had; some amazing Sunflowers! Took two tabs (my usual dose), was so far gone my dumb-arse mates called an ambulence and I came round in A&amp;E telling my friends I loved them. First thing said to me; &quot;good acid, eh?!&quot; Was still tripping 24h after I dropped! If I could get that I&#039;d pay any money for it - proper Owsley-acid! <br /><br />It&#039;s my biggest disappointment with SR - all the LSD is a bit weak as-advertised; usually no more than 150ug. Barely above threshold! My save up for some of the liquid at some point though, but lots of bitcoins so big risk, and really it&#039;s what I came here for.... ho hum, still better than I can find round my manor. Used to be able to get strong trips at £2ea as recently as &#039;99 (about the cost of 4-6 chocolate bars)...

				weed is the only drug i can take almost every day without screwing my life, which is why it&#039;s my favorite. shrooms, acid and MDMA are also cool, but i can&#039;t take drugs like these regularly. when coming down from them i always feel how much it exhausts my brain and i can&#039;t have that every week, not even every month. i also enjoy speed occasionally, the come down isn&#039;t tiring me out as fuck like MDMA does.<br />anyway, weed is the best! there&#039;s nothing more relaxing than taking a big hit from the bong after a stressful day while listening to cypress hill :)

The super happy, blissful, horny high is just too awesome not to be my number two. I doubt I will ever get tired of this drug.<br />3) LSD: This is actually my favorite psychedelic, but as far as general drugs, its the third. But its so awesome because I&#039;m always in a good mood when I take it unlike some other psychedelics, it lasts a good long time, and its the easiest psychedelic to take by far.

				It&#039;s hard to pick a favorite, but LSD, Metocin/Acetylcin, Molly, and 2C-B all have their proper time and place. If I had to pick just one for the rest of my life, it might be 2C-B: there&#039;s such a broad range of effects as you vary the dose, but generally, it&#039;s just so wonderful!<br /><br />Pot and caffeine would be very hard to live without though...

				medical grade weed, and of course, Opiates... Loved the old formula oxycontins, norco vicodins, but eventually tried heroin. (no needles though!)&nbsp; im mainly a weekend warrier, especially with SR prices but I love some opiate induced euphoria and itching... Tried almost everything, love acid and shrooms and ecstacy if im going to coachella or a rave... was a tweaker for a time back in my high school days, that was bad news, occasional blow only if its amazing quality which is rare.. actually im all about quality over quantity with any drug. i consider myself a connoisseur, and an artist... <br /><br />Silk Road is a revolution
