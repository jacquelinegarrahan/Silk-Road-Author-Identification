				Hey all yous-<br />I just got a teener from kush411 the other day and everything was as it was back in late Feb/March when I got my last few sacs from em. shipping was like clockwork and the high is everything I look for in crystal (rush of euphoria,ambition, and sociability, only problem is that it came in 2 large crystals and a few smaller shards, all of which are quite moist. When I chop them up I can actually see beads of moisture and the crushed shards just kind of stick together in damp clumps as well as sticking to the razor and the mirror surface. The first shard I chopped and crushed into powder for snorting and scraped into a little envelope made out of a post-it note, which I folded up and kept in my sock for about 2 hours. That was enough to dry out the powder to how it&#039;s supposed to be and it blasted me off into space, but I still don&#039;t know what to do to dry out the remaining two giant crystals and other chunks. I PMed Kush411 for advice yesterday afternoon but they have yet to respond, so I just chopped the rest up into pebbles and small shards and stored it all in folded pieces of paper which I then put inside a wooden box with some desiccant packets and a bigger oxygen absorbing packet. I did have it in a prescription bottle withe absorbents but I figured the wood would help dry it out further. Is there anyone who could give me any good advice? In my 5 months of fucking with crystal from SR I&#039;ve never gotten wet gear like this, I&#039;m not sure what to do and I really don&#039;t want to ruin my stash. Thanks for any help in advance!

				Hey all you have to do is crush to a poeder let it dry and its goood to go. You can recrystalize small shards in 90% iso alchol just cover the powder with a bout 1.5 times fluid to powder warm in a hot plate or microwave&nbsp; till disolved. put it in the freezer for a couple hours and you will have freez precipitated shards that will be even better cleaner than they were before just small. If you want to take another step and the time to make larger shards disolve the ones you just made in distilled water but only add enough to were theydisolve with as little water as possible add a little heat&nbsp; and over the next week or more slowly shards will form and grow and grow! But you have to wait till all the moisture is gone and it takes time.

				Another way would be to disolve it in water like you going to shoot it.However buy a simple nasal spay bottle pu it in that a n spray it up your nose. works real well and awsomely stealth,&nbsp; also works with coke thats how I used to get away with it at work.
