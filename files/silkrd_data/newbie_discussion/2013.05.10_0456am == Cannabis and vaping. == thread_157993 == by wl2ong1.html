				I&#039;ve only used a cheap hand help vape and a Silver Surfer Vape. <br /><br />I recommend the SSV to anyone. The one I was lucky enough to indulge with was 2.5 years old that I know of. I don&#039;t remember if he bought it used or not, but he goes through a lot of weed (Usually shit dirt weed) and that is the only thing I vaped from it... This was before learning about MC and the benefits. I have never vaped MC... It&#039;s on the to do list. I will get a SSV and a nice hand held... (Or I may just get a vape pen and start going with concentrates)...<br /><br />That&#039;s what this thread is for. Share some experiences with different vapes/vape pens. I could totally use some advice on a hand held or the best way to go about using a vape pen and the best vape pen to use. <br />Thanks.

To me, the bag is for parties. WHen you have 10 people ready to clear the bag.. For the few people I prefer to smoke with, the SSV will work for a stationary vape. However, if I ever cross paths with someone that has one, I will try it out... :) <br />

				I would highly (hehe.... highly...) recommend the vape pens for concentrates. I find that the regular vape never gets me as loaded as I would like. (I&#039;ve never owned a volcano though. I have a Vapor Brothers model). The concentrates really do the trick though :D Usually one hit is all it takes and I&#039;ll be high for hours. Its a great way to keep your lungs healthy.<br /><br />You can just get a regular E-Cigarette and its cheaper than buying something specifically for cannabis. It&#039;ll run you about $40 or so, where a cannabis product might go as high as $100. I like the Ego-W for oils, myself.

				I agree with everyone else and recommend the Volcano vaporizer, its amazing! Tried it when I was in Amsterdam in December.

If I ever come across an amazing deal, I will get one. I highly recommend the Silver Surfer Vape. You can purchase a new one on Ebay with a 3 year warranty for 160-200 with a free grinder and hemp travel bag. The amazing thing to me about the SSV, you can purchase a bowl that sits on the top that you can use for scented oils... the things that gets me about the oils, they are not overpowering scent wise, they are specifically created for aromatherapy, they are mellow and mellow the mood.&nbsp;

				Again, I have to repeat.&nbsp; If you&#039;re prepared to spend the budget on a volcano, look into delta9vapes.&nbsp; The Omicron is like entry level vape pen, Persei is the power user pen.&nbsp; They&#039;re both concentrate-based, but the company makes many adapters and attachments, one of which is called the Hercules and is for use with both concentrates or flowers.&nbsp; So it can be the best of both worlds for a budget less than the volcano.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;ve rarely smoked flowers since I got my Persei.

				Well as with all things, tolerance comes the more you do it.&nbsp; But yes, with the configuration of my Persei right now, anyone would get pretty high after one to a few hits and it tends to last a while.&nbsp; The Persei specifically is variable voltage by changing out the battery combinations.&nbsp; There are different ohm cartridges for different power ratings for different people.&nbsp; 5 ohm cartridge at 7.4v (strongest setting) will knock out most people after a couple hits.<br /><br />So for me personally, I&#039;m hitting my pen quite a bit throughout the day more than just a few times a day, but not everyone would have to do that.&nbsp; To maybe answer your question better, I filled .7g of oil in a cartridge a few days ago, have been using it nonstop, and have probably gone through &lt;.2g so far.&nbsp; mileage may vary.

				All of you guys breaking the bank for the big vapes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never smoked out of a volcano; I bet it rocks, but it just is so much money.&nbsp; You can get a popular selling box/whip vape on ebay for $27.&nbsp; It has a temperature dial and works just as well (quite a popular seller there).&nbsp; <br /><br />My only issue is the vaping temp.&nbsp; I think you need to keep it just below combustion at like 388 to get all the goodies that give you the &quot;stoned&quot; feeling.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve got a MFLB which is pretty handy for covert getting stonedness. I tried a volcano when I was in Amsterdam and it was probably the most stoned I&#039;ve ever been off a lungful before. <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame they are so expensive, but then at least it beats buys tabs/baccy to roll joints with - don&#039;t really like the idea of cancer

				Not to stay on Volcano&#039;s dick but you can actually vape concentrates I do it with my digit all the time. <br /><br />That&#039;s what the oil sponge thing is for that came with it. So it doesn&#039;t melt down &amp; fuckup your shit,
