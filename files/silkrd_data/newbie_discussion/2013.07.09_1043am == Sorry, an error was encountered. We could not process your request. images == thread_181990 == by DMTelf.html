				I keep getting &quot;Sorry, an error was encountered.<br /><br />We could not process your request.&quot;<br /><br />Whenever I try to add an image to my listing. Which is kind of important since its a uniquely packaged product.<br /><br />Any ideas? Are there certain image file formats or sizes / dimension that work better?

				Hi DMTelf.&nbsp; I have never posted an image, so I cannot help you there.&nbsp; I will do some rummaging through the forums and try to find something related.<br />One thing I&#039;d like to note: in your post you said this &quot;Whenever I try to add an image to my listing. Which is kind of important since its a uniquely packaged product.&quot;&nbsp; <br />Do not reveal your shipping methods!&nbsp; A picture of the product, with your vendor name and a time stamp will suffice.

				Yes, take note of what &quot;shaman of the earth&quot; has to say, all newbies should take this in and on what follows.<br /><br />I do not know whether you have heard of metadata in connection with images? And I do not know how much (if any) you do know. You are going to need to learn fast if you are going to pursue this sort of thing on SR and I suggest you read the following:<br /><br />http://lifehacker.com/5149327/jpeg--png-stripper-removes-the-metadata-from-your-images<br /><br />It is&nbsp; a useful site for all sorts of stuff, there are many links to all kinds of things, but the above thread will sort out your problem and probably introduce more (just kidding) but remember, no not reveal your shipping methods.<br /><br />Hope this helps and if you have any problems then try and post them here again.<br />

				First, scrub all data off with an &quot;exif&quot; cleaner. Exif refers to metadata left in jpeg, png, etc. pictures when captured by the camera. These bits of information could reveal much about you including: camera type, lens type, and even gps coordinates of where said picture was taken.<br /><br />Second, try resizing the picture to a lower pixel x pixel count. I know this works for uploading forum avatars. Perhaps it would also work for vendor listings as well..

				Thanks for all the advise. I ended up screen capturing the images to get rid of meta data and to decrease the image size below 1mb, and then they all worked :)
