				Hi, i&#039;ve just joined the site and the community. I can&#039;t wait to try some of the good stuffs I&#039;ve seen on SR but I really don&#039;t know where to recieve them.<br />I live in Italy and I really don&#039;t feel confident giving my home address. Any suggestion? Where you recieved your first order? If some of you is italian, please PM me, I&#039;d like to have some questions answered (in italian of course ;) )<br /><br />Thank you.

				Send it to a friends house obviously someone you trust and you let them know it&#039;s going to be arriving. This also has a double function for plausible deny-ability. Say the package gets intercepted/opened and your friends house is raided and his computer sized...well there&#039;s no tor or silk road on his computers so they can&#039;t prove he made any order and all he has to do is deny he ordered the package and has no idea what it is or where it came from thus the authorities can&#039;t do anything. Read up on the law.

It looks suspicious and mail men aren&#039;t dummies
