				Well, I guess I got no other choice than to post this here.<br /><br />So in preparation for my first purchase I installed Liberte on a USB flash drive and booted it. On startup I set my password, used epiphany to reach this forum and practiced PGP with the help of astor. Other than that, my Liberte is completely on default settings, I did not touch a thing yet. I&#039;m using the latest version of Liberte.<br /><br />I&#039;m only using this flash drive for SR business and nothing else. However, at the moment I cannot access various websites due to the same error message I&#039;m getting from privoxy. I&#039;ve spent a lot of hours over the past few days googling like crazy desperately trying to find solutions but I just can&#039;t get it fixed, but that might just be because I have no idea of linux.<br /><br />So, this is the error I am getting when I try to access the Silkroad marketplace:<br /><br />503&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is Privoxy 3.0.19 on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8118, enabled<br />Forwarding failure<br />Privoxy was unable to socks5-forward your request http://silkroadvb5piz3er.onion/ through 127.0.0.1: SOCKS5 request failed<br /><br />Just try again to see if this is a temporary problem, or check your forwarding settings and make sure that all forwarding servers are working correctly and listening where they are supposed to be listening.<br /><br /><br />This is a (slightly different) error message I get when trying to access for example instawallet:<br /><br />503&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This is Privoxy 3.0.19 on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8118, enabled<br />Forwarding failure<br />Privoxy was unable to socks5-forward your request http://www.instawallet.org/ through 127.0.0.1: SOCKS5 TTL expired<br /><br />Just try again to see if this is a temporary problem, or check your forwarding settings and make sure that all forwarding servers are working correctly and listening where they are supposed to be listening.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s what I have tried to so far:<br /><br />- Switched to shell and got root access, opened the privoxy config file and writing rights and checked through the forwarding options to see if everything looks as it&#039;s supposed to.<br /><br />- Spammed the &quot;Switch to new TOR identity&quot; and refreshed SR website hoping that once in a while it might actually load up but no success.<br /><br />- I heard I needed to change the host.allow file to allow TOR access or something. However, this attempt was stopped in it&#039;s tracks because I couldn&#039;t find this file.<br /><br />- I wanted to check the proxy settings for epiphany but turns out it doesn&#039;t have such options. Then I went searching for the gnome network prefences to check the proxy settings but I cannot find the gnome-network-preferences. I tried typing it into the terminal but only got &quot;command not found.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I really tried everything I could as best as I could but I just can&#039;t figure this out. I would really appreciate any help I can get, even though I guess most of the people that could help me are over at the tech support, a part of the board I&#039;m not allowed to post in unless I spam this forum another 40 times.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				I get the same problem all the time.&nbsp; In fact every single time I boot up liberte and try to get on SR with Epiphany,&nbsp; I get this error.&nbsp; I just keep refreshing for anywhere between 10 and 30 mins while I open other tabs to browse elsewhere and stay occupied while I wait.&nbsp; Eventually I get through to the login page.&nbsp; Once logged in to SR,&nbsp; going from page to page seems much quicker, but occasionally that error will pop up again and I will have to start the refreshing spree again until it comes back. I would say just be patient, but I am a noob and maybe there is a better way around it.

				If you have a /etc/hosts.deny file, could you paste it?<br /><br />Also, could you post your modifications to privoxy&#039;s conf? You should pretty much only need a line like &quot;forward-socks4a .onion localhost:9050&quot; in it to let tor through for .onion sites.<br /><br />Before any of that though, you should *turn privoxy off* and point your browser directly at tor, to make sure that it&#039;s working at all outside of the bundle.

				Forwarding Failure?<br /><br />Have you ever done the setup for a TOR relay? How about an exit node? When you close the programs, or your ISP is intermittent, it can cause latency and traffic halts.

				I&#039;m having similar troubles as well. <br /><br />I just set up Liberte on a flash drive, but epiphany wont connect to any site. I get the same error as the op. <br /><br />I am interpreting this as me not having a connection at all, as I seem to not be able to properly connect to my wireless router. I keep giving the password for my wifi, and it seems that for a minute all is ok - then I&#039;m asked for the pw again.<br /><br />I see all the networks at my location, but just cant connect to them. I&#039;ve tried my own wifi, and one open wifi that i see here, but no luck. <br />Also, when I turn on internet tethering from my phone, Liberte can&#039;t see that at all. (Is it even wise to use Liberte / Tor through 3G?)<br /><br />This is really annoying, as I want to have all this set up properly before I start making purchases. Only thing I need now is the wireless.<br /><br />I&#039;m no geek, and do not really wish to become one, so plz no &quot;the answers are in experience... Get some&quot; -answers. I only wish to buy, sell and use my favourite illegal substances with some peace of mind...<br /><br />Any help very much appreciated.

TOR, PGP,&nbsp; Liberte, encryption, USB, aren&#039;t these the tools to use for that? I want to be able to use them efficiently enough to make me anonymous enough so that I wont leave traces. I wouldn&#039;t want to dig too deep into this, as I dont have the time to learn Linux or command line and such. My expertise is elsewhere.<br /><br />2.<br />When the LE eventually comes through my door after intercepting, I will off course deny, deny, deny. It really would help, if they can&#039;t find anything linking me to anything shady. Only the USB drive that I just &quot;found laying on the street the other day&quot;.<br /><br />That is why I am here on the forums bugging you people who hold the knowledge. I dont want all of your in depth -information, you gurus, just enough that I can reasonably safely shop some wares from here instead of the street corner. And I really thought that the idea of these forums was to help newbies like me reach that goal. <br /><br />Was I wrong? Did I misunderstand something?
