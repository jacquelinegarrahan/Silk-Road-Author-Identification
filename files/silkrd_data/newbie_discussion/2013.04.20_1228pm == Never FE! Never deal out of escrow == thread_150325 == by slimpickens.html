				SR are the escrow intermediary. I know it&#039;s virtually the rule never to FE, but when you have an absolute trusted relationship with a vendor, you might exercise this option. Again, I&#039;m not suggesting it, but in situations where the trust has grown to levels where large shipments are taking place, cashflow, or lack thereof, might require FE to complete in a reasonable manner. Of course, you should trust the vendor like your granny (if she&#039;s still alive), otherwise, nope.<br /><br />Slimpickins, why re-post so much? you don&#039;t get any extra points?
