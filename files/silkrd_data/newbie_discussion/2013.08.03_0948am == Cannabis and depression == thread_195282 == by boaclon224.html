				Hi all. So I have noticed recently that I&#039;ve started feeling somewhat depressed, and was curious to hear about how that interacts with cannabis use for others around here. Depression is something I&#039;ve struggled with in the past, and have a family history of. There are circumstances in my life that don&#039;t help it at the moment, but I&#039;ve been using cannabis more heavily (about 50% of days) recently, and was wondering whether it might be responsible in some way, or indeed keeping me more well than I would otherwise be.<br /><br />Links to reading, personal experiences, whatever would be much appreciated.

				If you have negative effects from cannabis it could be simply the strains you are using, indicas, sativas or whatever or many other external factors. <br /><br />I find if im not productive and eating properly then i cant enjoy just sitting around smoking like i used to. I have friends who have got depressed from it or paranoid but this is because they were unhappy with aspects of their life or scared of being caught dealing. <br /><br />Your mind and body gives you signs that sometimes you have to change your habits its just working out what needs to be done. <br /><br />Personally if I could get sativa heavy strains all the time I probably would never of had any issues with cannabis but if I get up and smoke a knockout strain I cant work properly and this gives me a guilt that leads to some sort of depression. <br /><br />Keep active, keep healthy and if when you smoke the same worries keep arising then do something to change them. Thats my advice..

I think cannabis is probably more forcing me to deal with issues in my life, which is overall positive, but not wholly easy. I suspect what you both mentioned about not being productive feeding into it is certainly a factor for me, and it&#039;s the sort of thing that is quite easy to let spiral.<br /><br />Any other thoughts would be most welcome.

				Having the exact same problem right now myself. If I&#039;m not high, I&#039;m sad, simple as that. The trick is definitely to stay busy. Go outside, exercise, play games ect. I&#039;m kinda at a crossroads in my life so I&#039;m hoping once things blow over I can enjoy smoking weed again, rather than just forcing myself to smoke to suppress feelings.

				Moderation, moderation, moderation as the other posters have stated.<br /><br />I actually smoke to combat depression because I refuse to put that crazy shit they pass from big pharma into my body. My doctor put on one of them once, Paxil I think, and that crap just made me feel like my head was going to explode and I couldn&#039;t sit still for two seconds and then ironically did littel to nothing to actually help with the depression.<br /><br />Of course life has a major impact on this, but if things aren&#039;t horribly bad in your life than this is a good sign you are smoking too much. Maybe try to take it down to about half a bowl a day or something, or quit for a while like others have said. I&#039;ve been in the same situation myself before (of course my life was in the dumps at the time too) and smoking more didn&#039;t help. If you feel worthless sober, you aren&#039;t going to do much better high. And keep in mind there is actually one legit study out there that shows that moderate Cannibis use will fight depression but too much will amplify it.<br /><br />Good luck friend and hang in there. There&#039;s always a light at the end of the tunnel even when you can&#039;t see, it&#039;s still there, you just have to focus.

				I think you should take a break or at least slow it down. Last year I went through an episode of depression and smoking weed every day didn&#039;t really help then I took a break and I started to feel better. but now when I smoke pot I get really paranoid. just doesn&#039;t work with my brain chemistry I guess. <br />anyways it&#039;s best not to use drugs or to at least use them in moderation if you&#039;re not mentally stable.

				from my experiences, cannabis does NOT help with depression.<br /><br />if you are suffering from depression, please seek help...either from a medical professional or friends.<br /><br />mental health issues are no joke.&nbsp; and like a physiological condition, can get worse over time when untreated.<br /><br />do not self medicate for depression.&nbsp; <br /><br />good luck!

				Cannabis can indeed lead to (feelings of) depression or aggravate an existing depression. <br /><br />Take a break from smoking for a few weeks/months. That can never hurt.<br /><br />Smoking is a nice way to relax, but it should be an escape, or your only way of relaxing, for that matter.

				Cannabis will absolutely affect the way you think and feel.&nbsp; If you are per-disposed mentally, depression can certainly result from ongoing usage.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a direct result of the chemicals, but a side effect of the other physiological and mental effects.<br /><br />As with all psychoactive drugs, your environment and mental state will have significant effects on your experience.&nbsp; With cannabis in particular, the particular plant (more so then strain) matters a lot.&nbsp; What is was fed, how it was grown, and the energy that it experienced as it aged significantly effects the high.&nbsp; The same strain can cause severe paranoia, or none at all, depending on how it was grown.&nbsp; That said, for many people continued use of any cannabis will usually see a decrease in those side effects.&nbsp; If paranoia and anxiety is a major issue, try a few different types, and specifically look for something non-kush that burns a very very light grey or white ash.

				Repeated use over short periods of time will absolutely alter the delicate balance of chemistry in a users brain. Everyone is different, but especially in teenagers there can be some symptoms of depression or anxiety caused by cannabis use.<br /><br />If you google around on the normal net you can find many articles and papers on this topic, however as with anything drug related a lot of it is bullshit left over from the anti-drug campaigns in the western nations. <br /><br />I have personally seen several people become depressed ranging from mild to severe symptoms after a couple of years medium to heavy cannabis use. Just taking a break for a few weeks/couple months can help, and obviously you should not take drugs such as SSRIs or other brain meds while taking a lot of recreational drugs. DX

Mushrooms can go very bad when done in the wrong setting. But if you read up on it a little and prepare carefully it can really help.

				Man ever since I started smoking pot on a regular basis(loong time ago) I&#039;ve been thinking about the relation between cannabis and depression. This is what I&#039;ve come up with after years of smoking. I started smoking at 13. At first I wasnt really too much into it. I liked it but I didnt have much access and just didnt really think of it as I do now. You could say I was somewhat depressed before I started smoking, which might have something to do with it. Anyways, being high is amazing definately. And depending on your personality, after a while of smoking you start to rely on the feeling of being high. It becomes a safe haven and you are at peace every time. But then you get a tolerance, and stop getting as high. This is where smoking weed stops becoming fun. Now your a chronic chronic toker, and since you rely so heavily on being high, you dont even smoke to get high at this point...your smoking to feel normal. 1 bowl used to get you BAKED. 1 bowl doesnt even get me high now. Currently, I rely HEAVILY on weed. I smoke it to maintain. Some where along the point of gaining a tolerance, you will notice that smoking weed is not what it used to be to you. Now its just a regular part of the day. A routine. Once I realized this I think I got a little more depressed because I realized that Im kind of trapped. I used something that was so great and made me feel amazing so much that now I need it to maintain. At that point, my mindset was prettty grim. Life revolved around getting high. <br /><br />After a while of that shittyness though comes a point where you step back and slap yourself in the face for being such a pussy. I did at least. It&#039;s only WEED. I started at 13 for emotional/mental benefit. At my current age I realized that I didnt need weed at all back then...it just made life alot easier. You dont need ANYTHING AT ALL ON EARTH besides food, water, air, sunllight, and plants and bees and all that stuff. I like to think of everything else in life as Accessories. Things I dont really need but make my life easier. This mindset really helps alot, especially when you run out of weed WHICH IS THE BIG REASON FOR DEPRESSION DUH!. Anyways, I think people grow out of it. Its a stage in life that hopefully you dont get stuck in. I had a few life experiences(&amp;near-death) that have taught me better than any therapist could have. Life is delicate. You can die at any fucking time. Like right now a plane can crash into your house or someshit. Anyways, people realize there is too much to life to get depressed about not having weed. <br /><br />I still smoke hella buds and when I run out I do get a bit down but nothing near where I used to get. Now I just go do shit, and I can just stop thinking about it easily where as before I couldnt really.............................long ass rant sorry this is a subject ive been pondering for a long ass time.

				Wow, thanks so much for all the thoughtful replies everyone - so many great insights. I&#039;ve decided to take a break for a while, and also work on expanding my friendship group.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to have anything to do with medical professionals if I can help it, I figure good friends that I can be close to is the way forward. Hardly an earth-shattering revelation, but important to me nonetheless.<br /><br />Quite a few people have mentioned paranoia and anxiety, but they aren&#039;t really issues for me. Or at least I can bring them under control quite easily. Cannabis has been an enormously positive part of my life, and I plan to get back to it sometime, but I think distance for at least a few weeks will do me a lot of good.<br /><br />The mention of mushrooms is an interesting one, I&#039;ve heard anecdotal stories about it having very positive effects for different mental issues. But yes, certainly not something to be done too lightly. I&#039;ll give them a try when the time and setting is right.<br /><br />And I know there is likely to be some research out there on weed and depression, but as someone mentioned, the war on drugs has made finding actually reliable research more difficult, and I have neither the time nor expertise to wade through a lot of articles to figure out the truth.<br /><br />Many, many thanks to you all.
