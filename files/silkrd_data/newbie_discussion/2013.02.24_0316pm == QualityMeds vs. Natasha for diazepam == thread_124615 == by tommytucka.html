				Note that this belongs in the rumor mill, just stil trying to get my post count up. Any and all comments are welcome. Thanks.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been pricing out valium for some time now and Natasha has all great feedback on the forums, whereas I don&#039;t see QualityMeds mentioned too much. <br /><br />The difference is huge: Natasha offers 10 x 10mg and QM has 30(!) x 10mg for only slightly higher. Any experience with QM, or any idea why his is such a better deal?

				I bought some from her last summer when she sold them in 60 counts.&nbsp; Solid stuff, but personally, i don&#039;t think valium is worth her asking price.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried QM&#039;s valium so I can&#039;t speak to the quality, but if i were going to buy diazepam, I&#039;d probably try QM&#039;s just to check it out.<br /><br />There&#039;s other vendors too who sell it much cheaper.&nbsp; Not sure why her prices are higher than average, I&#039;ve seen the same valium from other vendors charging a more competitive price.&nbsp; I assume her prices are based on the fact that she sells smaller quantities.&nbsp; But based on the lone transaction i had, you&#039;ll get a quality product in a timely manner.&nbsp; So it&#039;s up to you what you want to do

				Word, thanks for sharing. I would have gone with QM just to try out a new vendor to me, but then I found some better prices on other benzos. I realized I&#039;m not a huge fan of diazepam anyway, but I think I did get some good xanax from Natasha, if I remember correctly. Anyways, onto better things.
