				Wouldn&#039;t it be more plausible that you had received drugs in the mail unknowingly if there is a fake name on the package versus your name written all over the shipping info? Just something that I was considering since I would rather chance never receiving a package over having criminal charges from using SR. I mean I would guess that most of us are otherwise law abiding citizens and having that on your record just cause you wanted to get some quality drugs would be some shit

				A fake or suspicious sounding name gets the package flagged and possibly opened. Research a seller with good stealth and ship to a real name of a bill paying person at the address. Anyone can ship you a package, deny you ordered the package personally or know who did.

				Realistically the plausible deniability scenario is unlikely to happen. If the police are going to come pounding at your door, they will first gather evidence of you receiving and using the contents of multiple packages, not just one of them, and at that point you are probably boned no matter who&#039;s name is on the address. So, there&#039;s really no reason to use a fake name.

				Like these two said dude. Dont use bogus names, it shouts shady business to your postman. Think about it, its their job to read your info day in and day out. A fugaize name is just asking for it.

				Ill throw my two cents in before its to late!<br /><br />I thought about using a fake name and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t!! <br /><br />My mailbox is very very small and the package didn&#039;t fit. The postman left it with my landlord.<br /><br />Now I got the package fine, unopened and everything was great that night!&nbsp; However if I had used a fake name, I would of never gotten my package and looked super suspicious trying to get it.&nbsp; The first thing the landlord checked was the name on the lease and compared it the name on the package.&nbsp; + If you take a package that doesnt have your name on it and open it you have tacked on another felony charge if caught. <br /><br /><br />To jjoz:<br />When you move you are supposed to go to the post office and tell them to make sure to deliver your mail.

				Using a completely fake name in the address that you give sellers on SR decreases the likelihood that you&#039;ll receive packages containing your orders from here. <br />If you are very opposed to using your real name spelled correctly - which would of&nbsp; course be totally understandable - here are two much better alternatives as to what you can do to help protect your anonymity without risking interfering with the successful arrival of your purchases:<br />1) Use a name that&#039;s mostly similar to your real one, but with a couple subtle spelling differences.<br />2) If you live in an apartment building, I know you must have received or still be receiving lots of mail from the previous tenant. You could just use their name.

				May or may not have been due to the fake name. Although, if all the packages sent to the fake name have been coming from the same source, and now you start using your real name, that might even make it doubly suspicious.

				There is a VERY VERY VERY interesting topic about that in the shipping section. 6 pages of debate about whether or not you should use a fake name.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91972.75<br /><br />I would say you shouldn&#039;t use fake names.<br /><br />1) Use your real name is the best way to BLEND IN. And it doesn&#039;t let you more vulnerable than using a fake name. A fake name wouldn&#039;t fool anybody investigating on you. It&#039;s just more lies that can be reveiled and finally get back at you while intterogated.<br /><br />2) Keep no stuff at the delivery address. Or maybe just a few grams of W or something very small.<br /><br />3) Clean everything related to your order on your computer. Encrypt (TrueCrypt) strongly everything that can be related. For the rest use Privazer if you are on Windows. It will surely help a bit.<br /><br />4) If anything goes south, shut your mouth and repeatedly ask for your lawyer. Don&#039;t go in some weird stack of lies or explanation. Shut it down and think carefully at your next move.

Especially here in the UK, they&#039;d open the package and if they found a large amount (100 grams +) they would package it back up and send it to you, without a doubt. Then they&#039;d gather the evidence of you dealing,m because they&#039;d be much happier if they got enough evidence to put someone down for supply, rather than maybe getting someone to go down for intent to supply. <br /><br />LE in the UK are a joke..

We see a lot of hate towards LE here (yeah well no surprise). After all, LE does what their government asks them to do. They get rewarded from what our politics think is more important.<br /><br />Some should redirect that grudge to their government politics who cowardly keeps incarcerating drug users.<br /><br />In my country (~EU), an old school cop, just after retiring after years of duty, said we should legalize weed simply because it shouldn&#039;t replace their other duties which SHOULD BE to protect citizens and not only tell them what is good or not for them while selling (and taxes) alcool/tobacco. I think many cops don&#039;t really take any pleasure focusing on drugs. They just fills the objectives designated by corrupted politics...
