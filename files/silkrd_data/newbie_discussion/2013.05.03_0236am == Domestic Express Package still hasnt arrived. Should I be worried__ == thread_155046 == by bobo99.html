				Hey guys,<br />Just wondering if anyone could help me with this,<br />I ordered two grams of weed on Sunday night from a Domestic seller, reviews were 99%, and the comments were all saying how quick postage is, next day delivery etc,<br />Anyways after watching my mailbox like a hawk for the last few days, ive gotten so sick of waiting for it, and now im starting to wonder it infact has been seized.<br />Has anyone else had any experiences like this??<br />As its my first order on SilkRoad, so i really need help with what to expect..<br />Thanks

				Welcome!!Not sure where you are located but up here in the great white north sometimes packages can take a week or sometime even 9-12 buisness days(even express) There is a lot of things that can happen usually human error..I know on my first order i thought something was up but it finally did come in about a week and a half(express) Hang in there bud and if it does not come by the middle or end of next week i would start to worry and contact the vendor!
