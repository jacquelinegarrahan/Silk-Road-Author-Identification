				Just wondering if prices on here change as the bitcoin rates do? Or do the sellers need to update the prices themselves? I guess what I&#039;m asking is if it changes automatically as the price of bitcoin rises or drops.

				i doubt it;s changed automatically...it would need a direct link to an exchange like bitcoin.de which i highly doubt(plus it would probably make SR even slower than it is now)<br />Probably vendors have to re-value according to price but again maybe a more experienced member can say more

				The prices do change when BTC raises or drops in value, I would love to know the exact formula. Also SR is slow because it has become a popular website over the few years it exists now, and scaling can sometimes be hard. But the biggest influence on the slow loading times is that it&#039;s an .onion, hidden website... which makes it slow. I&#039;m sure if SR was a regular website it would be just as fast as amazon.com, if you notice the programming skills which made SR in the first place. ;)
