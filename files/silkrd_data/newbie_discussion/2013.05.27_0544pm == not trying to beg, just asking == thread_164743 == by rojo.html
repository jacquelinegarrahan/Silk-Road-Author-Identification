				Hi all, I was just wondering if anyone has $5.00 in bitcoin they might be able to spare for a fellow SR user. I miss calculated and now I am $5.00 short for my order. I have no way of adding that small of an amount to my account. I really am sorry for asking you all. I dont usually do this. Any help would be appreciated :) Happy Memorial Day :)

				there is a forum for this elsewhere but you have to get 50 posts to post on the off topic section. The chances of anyone giving to someone who&#039;s just joined the forums is very slim - I could make a load of accounts and make $50.00 in a day if they did!<br /><br />There are quite a few sites that will sell $5.00 worth of bitcoins - some have a minimum of 0.01 BTC purchase.

				I suggest you to post your request in the apposite thread meant for this, someone will surely help you there:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=65125.0<br /><br />I would do it myself but atm I have only about $3 in the account and transferring the money from the wallet would take more time than someone helping you in that thread.<br /><br />EDIT: Ops, sorry, didn&#039;t see you have only 12 posts. What is your SR account? I can lend you 0.03 btc and then you can ask someone else to give you the rest.

				Thanks guys, I promise you im not scamming. Just a guy trying to get $5.00 to place my order. Ive been on the forums alot, just havent posted a whole lot.&nbsp; As for sites that sell .01 coins. I have limited ways of buying online so it makes it a little harder for me. I usually have to use Bitinstant or something similar. But they have a $20 minimum. I will try that thread Iris but Im still a newb so I dont know that I will be able to post there. Thanks for the responses though guys :)

If someone ask and I have the possibility I will help them. If you need something in return or you help only when it&#039;s convenient it&#039;s not real help.<br />If the person is a scam that&#039;s his/her problem with his/her dignity. If you have a so low dignity that you sell yourself for $5 then the money you steal is the least of your problems.

I can lend you 0.03 and I&#039;m sure somebody else will lend you the rest. Tell me your SR account name so I will give you the 0.03 for now.<br /><br />EDIT: Btw I&#039;m sure that if you are short of 0.01 btc (after my help) and you contact the vendor s/he will without problems lower the listing or lend you the btc so that you can place the order. Just contact him/her.
