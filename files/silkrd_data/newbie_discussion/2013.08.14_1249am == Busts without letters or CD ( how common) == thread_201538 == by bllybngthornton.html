				I have searched and have not found much evidence of anyone getting in trouble without a CD or letter being sent to pickup a package. Can anyone provide any info on cases they are familiar with where the individual got busted without signing or receiving a letter to pickup ? <br /><br />

				I just got released on bail from my local county jail.<br /><br />Went to get my mail from my P.O. box and it was empty when I checked it.<br />As I locked it back and headed towards the door, two big officers quickly threw me up against the wall and handcuffed me before I even had a chance to open the door. <br />I was booked for conspiracy to posess a controlled substance with intent to distribute.<br /><br />I ordered 100 xtc pills international from a very high ranked vendor.<br /><br />My next plan of action, order 500 pills this next time and sell them all before the feds get their hands on em&#039;.<br />Then I&#039;ll have enough cash to pay off the feds and court fees, etc. and still pay my rent for this month.<br />Wish me luck.
