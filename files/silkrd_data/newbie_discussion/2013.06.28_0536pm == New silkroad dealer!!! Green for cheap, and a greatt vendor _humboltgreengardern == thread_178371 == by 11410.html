				We all are a little skeptical when it comes to new vendors on the road. I&#039;ve had a new vendor scam me for over 450 dollars.. sent my an empty box with tracking and sr believed that it was delivered due to the tracking. Long story short I ended up losing my whole account. So I was highly skeptical about trying the new vendor HumboltGreenGarden. He had good bud and great prices so I said what the heck. <br />I LOVED everything about this vendor. His weed was dank, cheap, great buds, and hit hard. But other than product, his communication was great. He answered any and all questions and made the transaction as smooth as possible. Didn&#039;t try to force me to FE and kept in touch. Shipping wise was great. Took a little less than 4 days to get to the east south, was stealth, fast, and nobody could even tell what was in it. Def a 8/5 order and seller here. Have no worries when ordering from HumboltGreenGarden. He will take care of you. Btw, he randomly gave me the tracking for my goods too! I had no idea he shipped to me with tracking. Great dealer

				his weed looks good but looks like he is clearly selling bk-mdma or something similar rather than real MDMA. it doesn&#039;t look like mdma and the prices are way to cheap to be legit. even if you buy a kilo of mdma you are usually paying ~$15/g and he is basically selling it for $19/g if buying an ounce (not to mention he is domestic which is usually more expensive). who is going to sell felony drugs for a $4/g profit? much more likely that he bought a bunch of cheap bk-mdma and trying to pass it off as mdma to people who don&#039;t know any better

A reagent test is all that&#039;s needed here. If you&#039;re selling M-1, you&#039;re scamming people. Your weed can be balls out badass, and it doesn&#039;t change the fact that you cannot go around selling M-1 as MDMA and be straight.<br /><br />As someone who interacts with MDMA, I think it&#039;s especially shitty for a vendor to pull this crap. If users wanted that kind of scam, we&#039;d buy shit in clubs. Instead, we use the Road because of it&#039;s reputation of excellence. By misrepresenting what you&#039;re selling, you&#039;re tarnishing that excellence.<br /><br />If you want to list Methylone, list Methlyone. It has it&#039;s own section.<br /><br />If you&#039;re buying M-1 from the Road or the street and repackaging it as MDMA, then shame on you.

				Been over a week since his MDMA listings went down &quot;for a week&quot;.<br /><br />Also been even longer than that since our very one sided conversation where I tried to find out if his listing&#039;s &quot;bulk quantities will ship via EMS from China&quot; meant that he could ship small quantities domestically within China.<br /><br />Still waiting on the promised domestic Chinese listing for MDMA.

About 17 hours ago I asked him how long for the transfer. He sent me a message 5 hours later saying it would be 2 hours tops. That was 12 hours ago. I messaged him about 4 hours ago to check on things. I’m still waiting for the transfer and / or a response. Meanwhile, that listing is no longer there. I just looked at the listing 3 hours ago. It had to have been taken down some time over the past couple of hours. I will update when the situation changes.

				Update: <br /><br />I checked the MoneyPak and it still hadn&#039;t been touched. So I used it myself and told vendor to cancel order. I still haven&#039;t heard anything from this vendor. Its been almost 24 hours since I placed this order and he never touched the MP. Even though at one point he said 2 hours. Staying away from this guy and others like him. Learned my lesson and at least I got my money.

				First off I dont want your money dude I have 40 orders for mp in front of you imy service is first come first served and that is cool you cancel your order because I am only 1 person and honestly it was going to be a hour but everyone knows how transfering bitcoins work sometime&#039;s it takes 30 min and sometimes it takes a couple hours and you are free to go and spend your money with anyone else on the road but my % is the lowest but No harm done so I wish you the best of luck on the road (Didn&#039;t know everyone on here wanted coin&#039;s like that ..But now I know&nbsp; ???

				Hi,<br /><br />I created this forum account and came across this thread because it is in the newbies section.<br /><br />A few people were saying that HGG is a scammer so I talked about my experience with HGG. That being I ordered, and then received my order. The product was as described.<br /><br />My username here is not the same as my username on SR, so even HGG would have no idea who I am.

Needless to say; i too thought i saw the signs. I cant speak on the situation one buyer had with him because i wasn&#039;t there. I&#039;ve seen a couple of threads posted about a vendor being a scam and they were down-right convincing on the surface. But then the vendor would respond with a word for word copy of messages sent back and forth, and it wasn&#039;t the way the buyer originally stated. All i can say is my experience was that i did get my btc. Others didn&#039;t, but nobody has posted or come out and said that hhh ran off with their mp. Hell, one guy on this thread clearly said that after 18 hours he was able to pull the funds off of his mp and just cancel the order. It&#039;s one thing to have questions about a vendor&#039;s practices, but to just come out and say they are a scammer sole<br />ly. based on other people&#039;s words and not of your own experience ain&#039;t right. Please take this as advice and not an insult. Thanks.

				All im saying is has ANYONE with a presence on the forums ordered his molly? and tested it? at least like 7 grams or more.&nbsp; because when I ordered my molly he told me he was getting tons of orders and almost sold out..... but now nobody anywhere can back his product accept a few 5/5 and then a 1/5 saying they tested it just like mine will be in 3 days after resolution......<br /><br />Yeah cool dude might be a legit coin vendor..... but if he is scamming on molly..... once a scammer always a... well idk just my 2 cents
