				Sorry, as I know there is discussion on this and alternate methods to get bitcoin, but without bitinstant, I am in a bit of a panic.<br /><br />I am exploring the VirWoX page, and I know I have to get Linden dollars first, etc. What I don&#039;t understand is they said it will be sent to my avatar?&nbsp; And this part is not explained on the wiki page.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand this:<br /><br /><br />Terminals<br /><br />We operate a network of terminals in the Second Life virtual world. The Terminal Locations page contains an up-to-date list of them. You need them for two purposes: validation of your account and depositing Linden dollars (SLL) into your VirWoX account.<br />Validation<br /><br />When you validate your account, you create a permanent link between your SL avatar and your VirWoX account. This is necessary for an effective and secure transfer of Linden dollars between your Second Life account and your VirWoX account. The process is fairly simple: After you have entered your SL first and last name on the VirWoX registration form, and after you have logged in to VirWoX for the first time using the temporary password sent to you by email, log in to the Second Life world, go to a VirWoX Terminal and simply touch it. If the terminal is a genuine VirWoX terminal, it will pop up a dialog telling you the VirWoX username you have chosen in VirWoX for this avatar. Once you confirm this is indeed your username, the link is made, and you are all set.<br /><br />Important: If the terminal is not able to tell the correct username, it is probably not a real VirWoX terminal and you should not proceed!<br />How do you find a terminal?<br /><br />On the Terminal Locations page, we maintain a list of currently available VirWoX terminals.<br />How can you tell it is a real VirWoX Terminal?<br /><br />Have you ever wondered, why in the real world you have to prove your identity to an ATM (using your PIN), but the ATM never proves to you that it&#039;s a real ATM? In the Second Life world, this problem is even bigger because it is easy to build something that looks like a VirWoX terminal. Consequently, our terminals prove to you that they are real VirWoX terminals by greeting you with your VirWoX username plus your personal, secret TIN (Terminal Identification Number), that you can choose freely (and change it as often as you like) on the Settings page. Therefore, before you select &quot;Pay&quot; to pay something that looks like a VirWoX terminal, always touch it and check your username and TIN!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />When I click on the Terminal link a bunch of weird names pop up, so I just don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; Can anyone explain this part of the process?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />OR<br /><br />Is there a better/easier way for me to get some bitcoins as quickly as possible?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Help!&nbsp; :)

				AFAIK you can just skip the whole part about the avatar. That&#039;s only if you are buying Lindens and want to use them in the actual game SecondLife. In fact, I&#039;m pretty sure that if you send the Lindens to your avatar, then that&#039;s it, you won&#039;t be able to put them back into your Virwox account. I believe you have to purchase the SLL using $ (USD/EUR/etc). Then you trade the SLL for BTC. Then you can transfer the BTC out (though the first few times they will make you wait a day or two for a &#039;manual verification&#039; step).

				You don&#039;t actually need an &quot;avatar&quot; to complete a BTC conversion.&nbsp; Just put a fake username into where it asks you for one and do not click anything that asks you to send your SLL to your avatar.<br />The process, as mcguire39 pointed out, looks like this:<br />You load up cash (i.e. USD/EUR, etc), then convert it to SLL (because it won&#039;t let you exchange cash to BTC), then convert that SLL to BTC.<br />It&#039;s horribly inefficient though and there&#039;s fees every step of the way. I somehow still have .1 BTC laying around on mine because of minimums and fees.&nbsp; I recommend finding a different way to get BTC like localbitcoins.

				Funny you should recommend local, because that is what I am now leaning toward. I am communicating with someone on there who has excellent feedback and has been very helpful. Sounds like the process is very quick and easy.&nbsp; There are some online options where you don&#039;t have to meet, but I did some research, and I am more comfortable with meeting the person, so that is what I am going to do.&nbsp; Now I just have to wait for SR to get back up so I can figure out exactly how much I need to purchase from this person to cover my order.&nbsp; lol<br /><br />I will let everyone know how it goes.<br /><br />Thank you for explaining about the avatar step, and thanks to all those who took the time to respond and help me out.&nbsp; :)

				What dude said, You don&#039;t have to set up any avatars. just deposit $, change for SLL, then exchange SLL to bitcoin. withdraw, wait, repeat.

				Is it more expensive when i trade on VirWoX because I have to trade first in SLL? Is there any fee for trading?

				For VirWox you do need an avatar in SecondLife.&nbsp; The system will not let you convert from real world currency straight to BTC.&nbsp; You will need to go from Currency to SLL to BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are the steps from what i remember:<br /><br />1. Setup a SecondLife account<br />2. Register on Virwox using your secondlife avatars name.<br />3. Goto a terminal in Secondlife to link the accounts.<br />4. Begin Transferring<br /><br />Only issue with VirWox are the fees and the fact that you have to buy whole bitcoins.&nbsp;
