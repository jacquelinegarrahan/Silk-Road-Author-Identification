				go to your insta wallet copy the bitcoin adress.&nbsp; go to mt gox and find the part where it says send funds or send btc. paste the adress, enter the amount. wait for 2-6 hours.<br />go to your account on SR. copy the Bitcoin adress. copy it into the wallet. where it says send funds to, enter the amount. wait for 2-6 hours. <br />

Sending money directly to SR is safe, as they &quot;tumble&quot; coins (same thing you would be doing by sending to instawallet) during the recieving process.<br /><br />Ya like Canna said, Its simple. Just need to look on mt.gox i suppose where to &quot;withdrawl&quot; or &quot;send&quot; btc. Copy the wallet URL from SR account settings, and wait 1 or 2 hrs, and you should be good to go!

				yeah its safe. never used a proxy to funnel my btc through. if you have any problems with receiving your btc on your SR account after you sent them successfully (no receival after more than 12-24h.)&nbsp; you can contact the SR staff through your SR account with all the info and they will sort it out. Happened to me one time.

But if someone has done it recently let me know cause that will save me a hassle. I also think people use the wallets so there wont be a paper trail to SR from MTGOX, cause im sure they will willingly turn over info if it ever comes down to it

				If you are going to transfer your BTC from Mt.Gox to SR, and do it through TOR, you risk your account being suspended.&nbsp; If you search through the forums you can find more info on this.
