				In my opinion taking four days to ship an order is too long of a wait unless the vender is really over whelmed with orders that were placed before yours and he explains to you before hand how long it will take him before he can ship your order.&nbsp; Who cares if it affects your stats if the vender is flaky.&nbsp; Pick a vender that promises to ship in under 48 hours.

				I think unless the vendor makes it clear on their page that it could take that length of time, or if you have spoken to them and they have explained the delay, then the obvious thing to do is cancel... especially if it is hedged since (correct me if I&#039;m wrong here) when it is hedged the amount in escrow is counted as a fixed amount of US dollars rather than the amount of BTC you originally paid, and with BTC still steadily deflating as a currency then you are losing money while it is sitting in escrow as a dollar value, you will get less BTC back if you leave it sitting for ages before finally cancelling.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it affects your buyer stats, I don&#039;t see anything for it on the &quot;Purchasing Stats&quot; page on my account, and I don&#039;t see any reason why it should affect your stats since it isn&#039;t really possible for it to be your fault.

				The rules state that if your order has not been shipped after 4 days, you are entitled to a full refund - no impact on stats. <br />If you look at your orders page, you&#039;ll see the word &#039;cancel&#039;. After 4 days, that will be click-able.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;ve already FE&#039;d, your fucked. And you&#039;ll either have to work something out with the vendor, or contact SR support.&nbsp; (link in bottom right corner of Market homepage). <br /><br />If it&#039;s gonna take longer than 4 days, the vendor should really tell you this up-front.&nbsp; <br />Personally, I would contact the vendor first. See what they say.

				Have you tried to contact the vendor about the delay? He or she might be willing to make it up to you.<br /><br />Should always try to contact the vendor first. 4 days is a long time not to ship especially if the vendor says they ship fast. Definitely a reason to be annoyed. But you are in escrow so it doesn&#039;t hurt to see what can be worked out.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want a refund on your buying stats if you can avoid it. <br /><br />If the vendor has been on but not responding to your messages then I would go a head and cancel.
