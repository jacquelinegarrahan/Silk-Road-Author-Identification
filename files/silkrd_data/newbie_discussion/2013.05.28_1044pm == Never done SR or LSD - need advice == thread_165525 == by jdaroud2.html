				heyy welcome<br />cant give you exact usernames cause i dont use lsd but make sure you check ratings/feedback on SR and also read the vendors forum page and talk to people who have used the product. dont discount Canadian suppliers either. the boarder between canada and usa moves very freely. its pretty much domestic safe imo.<br /><br />the safe thing to do would be to have your gf sober<br />the fun thing to do is to both trip <br />ask the vendor how strong the tabs are. lsd is so cheap you could buy a bunch and maybe the first time you and your gf just take 1/2 a tab to test it out.

				Can&#039;t really answer about best US based vendor, I just ordered for the first time from BongSong as a lot of the other domestic vendors won&#039;t sell to first time buyers<br />The avengers thread is a good place for reviews of different vendors<br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />You should be somewhere you feel safe and comfortable with someone you feel safe and comfortable with. Make sure you have at least two days to do it, not that its going to last that long but I like to leave the second day open to resting and introspection. you aren&#039;t going to be able to sleep for a little while after your trip either. And be in a good frame of mind when you take it, if you have a lot of dark shit going on at the time it might not be the best time to trip.<br /><br />Has your girlfriend ever done acid before?

It&#039;s good to have a sitter, although I&#039;ve noticed sometimes if the person is sober and has never tripped before, it&#039;ll be hard to understand what you&#039;re experiencing if for whatever reason she has to talk you down. I kind of get annoyed by sober people when I&#039;m tripping to be honest.<br /><br />again, like robloblaw said, I&#039;d start with 1/2 for both of you and work your way up.

				if you`ll take it alone take a whole blotter. when taking with other people for the first time i usually reccomend half of it because of possible social withdrawing or bad tripping, when first taking these things you never know what can come out LOL. but soon after taking some more times you get confident in tripping with acid and you kinda &quot;steer&quot; the trip along in these doses for me. considering a medium strength real LSD blotter (90-100ug). sorry for bad english, bad keyboard here and high on weed&nbsp; ;D

				i&#039;m not sure if youve ever tried mushies but that could be another option. i think its a good practice trip to lsd. it lasts much shorter and you can control your dose better. <br />when tripping alone it can be kind of weird because the other person has no idea what your going through. personally i like to go through it with someone else. but first times should always be done with caution especially if your gf is an ultra noob<br />consider trying a gram or 2 of mushies for you and your gf to test the waters. maybe just give her 1 gram

				If your girlfriend is up for it do it together. Tripping with someone else you care about stops you getting all introspective and looping. And you will both feel richer at the end to have shared it. Just don&#039;t do more than 160ug or thereabouts each, nice quiet safe place, phones off, couple hours beforehand of chilling and calming down. All the usual LSD trip advice. Hope you enjoy, took my new girl through her first time earlier this year, she was amazed. Relax, don&#039;t fight the acid, have a lovely time. I&#039;m sure you will.

				I wouldn&#039;t have your girlfriend stay sober. Sober people are really annoying when you&#039;re on acid. They just can&#039;t comprehend what you&#039;re talking about and likewise what you&#039;re saying will probably annoy her. I would just get some xanax or some other anti-anxiety medication to have on hand in case you start to feel anxious. As long as you aren&#039;t taking a high dose your first time, you should be completely fine. Try and fast if you can. Don&#039;t eat while coming up, it really messes you up. Just relax somewhere comfortable and make sure it&#039;s clean and peaceful. I like to have nice ambient lighting and lots of pillows and blankets. Mind set and setting mean everything, but yeah get some xanax or something just in case. It will just give you added peace of mind and even if you don&#039;t have a bad trip, it can be incredibly hard to sleep after taking acid and I always end my trips with something to sedate me or it feels like it would never stop.

				I have ordered lsd from many people on the road. I have come to the conclusion that Tessellated and Jesusofrave are the BEST vendors, I have tabs coming from albionessentialols as well and he is highly revered as the KING so I am sure he wont disappoint.&nbsp;

				Ghiradelli thanks for the awesome thorough reply - definitely thinking of ordering from tess now (am in USA).<br /><br />Definitely agree my gf would be pissd at me sober and I&#039;m not sure she wants to trip...so a guide would still be a +, going to have to do some digging to find one though (NYC area, straight-laced friends)

				if you gf isnt 100% into it i wouldnt have her ingest. even minor hesitations can spiral out of control once the lsd starts kickin in. it is pretty smooth, as in you dont have the dramatic ups and downs compared to shrooms but it can happen. i think the best way to have your first trip is when your really excited about it. the positive mind frame can off set the feelings of nervousness and being scared once all the new feelings and emotions starts kicking in from the drug. if you have to deal with that stuff while your already in a somewhat hesitant state its going to make it all more pronounced. and if it does go bad its going to be a long couple of hours. sometimes lsd feels like its never going to wear off and the seconds feel like hours&nbsp; :o

And I would also recommend not to trip with you gf if she&#039;s not feeling positive towards the whole thing. You will get all paranoid about what she`s thinking, etc. Acid+nice music+nice frame of mind = success. I`ve tripped lots of times alone in my own bedroom when i used to live with my parents and it was always great. I like smoking some weed when comming up and at the end of the experience as it makes me less anxious and also gives a nice warm touch to the whole thing. I also think a benzo is nice if you want to abort the trip, but I`d recommend you really think twice before doing it, cause bad trips can go away in seconds and if you abort it too soon you may be missing some awesome time, so i wouldnt take it unless it is really distressing you for some time. In case it does, try changing the music, doing other stuff, like taking a shower can be very funny and take your mid away from &quot;bad&quot; thoughts (but keep in mind one day you&#039;re gonna have to deal with them lol). As for my benzo of choice I like clonazepam (rivotril, klonopin, etc). It&#039;s long lasting and has a &quot;tripping&quot; value of its own which i like. Have a nice trip! Tell us about it after you do it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Acid is an amazing drug, but it is also a powerful one.&nbsp; If your gf hasn&#039;t even smoked pot, acid might be a little too powerful for her.&nbsp; One thing you could do is have a small &#039;social&#039; dose, about 40 or 50 mcgs to familiarize you and her with it.&nbsp; You won&#039;t really get an amazing experience, but it should lessen your gf&#039;s concern about it once she knows roughly what it does.&nbsp; Then wait a little while, a week or so, and take a full dose of perhaps 150 mcgs.&nbsp; I really recommend that you do it together, as others have said.&nbsp; It&#039;s a wonderful experience to share, and if she is just a sitter and has no idea what your experiencing you&#039;ll miss the intimacy of sharing together.&nbsp; Also, and this is very important, take it somewhere where you have quiet and not a lot of vibes from other people.&nbsp; Somewhere in nature is the absolutely best place to take it, rather than in a house or out with other people running about.&nbsp; I particularly like taking it in the desert.&nbsp; It is so quiet and free of vibes from other people.&nbsp; Nature is definitely the best place to take it.

				Kinda off-topic but alprazolam has an inverse effect on me. I actually get more anxious and sociophobic when I take them, and I was actually prescribed them by my psychiatrist. When I told her about it she switched me back to clonazepam.

Of course, some people simply don&#039;t give a fuck if they have giant pupils or are making all kinds of funny things and faces in public, but many do, so have that in mind, cause when you try to behave &quot;normal&quot; while on acid, especially for the first time, you just feel all paranoid. I like someone&#039;s ideia (sorry for not posting the names or quoting, my memory is terrible) of lots of pillows and comfy things also.

				Dosage, Set, and Setting<br /><br />Dosage:&nbsp; There are arguments for taking only a&nbsp; 1/2 hit your first time.&nbsp; I myself did 1 whole hit my first time.&nbsp; YMMV<br /><br />Set:&nbsp; Your mindset.&nbsp; Are you generally looking forward to a good time, for a 8 hour adventure through wonderland?&nbsp; No big things worrying or bothering you?&nbsp; Good.<br /><br />Setting:&nbsp; Where you are.&nbsp; Is it safe to run around and giggle and have a good time without other people weirding out on you?&nbsp; You&#039;ll want to be indoors for part of it, then at some point you&#039;ll need to be outdoors for the space.&nbsp; Its hard to explain but once you&#039;re tripping, you&#039;ll know what I mean.<br /><br />Its best if you and your GF do it together.&nbsp; If she&#039;s a very straight laced person, then maybe you both do half hits as sort of a training run.&nbsp; <br /><br />

So I have some bad feelings about xanax (alprazolam).<br /><br />Nature is perfect if you are at a private property or a somehow deserted place (like someone suggested, a desert lol). Of course, some people simply don&#039;t give a fuck if they have giant pupils or are making all kinds of funny things and faces in public, but many do, so have that in mind, cause when you try to behave &quot;normal&quot; while on acid, especially for the first time, you just feel all paranoid. I like someone&#039;s ideia (sorry for not posting the names or quoting, my memory is terrible) of lots of pillows and comfy things also. And I love taking acid on a nice desert sunny beach, where you can keep a safe distance from unwanted people and still enjoy the scenario, the sea, nature... god it&#039;s simply magical.&nbsp; &nbsp;::) <br /><br />Robloblaw, how do you prefer tripping on acid/psychedelics?<br />I find you a very interesting person, don&#039;t know why lol<br />I think that&#039;s because we started together as newbies and i remember you from many many posts here&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />how come i have so many more posts then you then? lol i have no life anymore after joining this forum<br />i rarely do psychs anymore. unless you consider k a psych but i&#039;m so accustomed to it now i dont find it trippy or anything. i used to be into them a lot. i was always more into mushrooms then acid. personally i like to be in a quite, safe, controlled environment. i have done pyschs all over the place from movie theaters to an amusement park to clubs/parties and although i didn&#039;t have a bad time, some trips were over powering and some places i had to spend to much time trying to not be so high. i dont like trying to control a trip. it leads to bad head space and i usually loose the fight. now when i trip i like to do it at my house or out in nature away from people who might interrupt. i think being out in nature is the most beautiful and connecting experience. if i just feel like having a fun time i will stay at home and fun on some comedy movies and laugh my ass off. it really depends on the people im with too. some of my all time favorite laughs have been on mushrooms with certain people. i love it when i start laughing and cant get myself to stop. how about you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hahahah I can&#039;t go a day without loging in here too lol guess I just need to write more.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Well I used to do a lot of acid some 10 years ago. Since then, I noticed the blotters aroud here were definetely not acid. After a little reasearch based on the &quot;symtpoms&quot; of the trip I found out they were some x-nBOME or DOx shit, which are a nice buzz but for me they can&#039;t compare to LSD. So I started taking mushrooms once in a while and I loved them. I actually started growing them, but they are much more &quot;philosophical&quot; for me they catapult me to a maniac state with megapower intelligence lol, I take them as If I&#039;m consulting some oracle, to make decisions in life, to get rid of the social masks we build in everyday life, and all the usual trip-talk lol... But acid has that fun rolling touch to it that I think can&#039;t be substituted by shrooms. I did K for a while but found it too neutral for me (i only did k-holes, I&#039;m interested in trying it in smaller quantities. Is it nice? Like in a nightclub-nice or tripping-at-home nice? ;D), even though I reached fantastic places and knowledge with it.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m more into uppers just for a change: mdma, coke, while my tollerance for psychedelics down a little. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165525.msg1190179#msg1190179">Quote from: RobLoblaw on June 02, 2013, 06:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i have done pyschs all over the place from movie theaters to an amusement park to clubs/parties and although i didn&#039;t have a bad time, some trips were over powering and some places i had to spend to much time trying to not be so high. i dont like trying to control a trip. it leads to bad head space and i usually loose the fight. now when i trip i like to do it at my house or out in nature away from people who might interrupt. i think being out in nature is the most beautiful and connecting experience. if i just feel like having a fun time i will stay at home and fun on some comedy movies and laugh my ass off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was starting to write but you summarized my experience with psychs lol<br />Except that I did have a bad time once when I took acid two days in a row and had something like a depressive pessimist trip. <br />Being in nature is something that only those who did it know what it is. Taking acid and entering the sea, for example, you melt and transform into the water, the sensations of water all over your body, the sun, the scenario ::). I take it at home, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends and it&#039;s always very nice. Beer and weed are almost always present too...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you have a girlfriend or a close friend, I would go ahead and do it with them. This way you can share&nbsp; the experience with each other. If you have a sober sitter, I would recommend that he stays removed from most of the trip, unless you ask for his/her help, since a sober sitter is not going to be able to add much to the trip, except for helping calm you down if you get too stressed.<br /><br />Regarding setting, I would do it either at home on a quiet day with some nice music or outdoors, and not somewhere where you will have to have social interaction.<br /><br />Just remember that regardless of what happens everything will be over in 6-8 hours, so just relax, take what comes, and don&#039;t panic. LSD is wonderful!

				Yeah, I would just look for vendors who have been around for a few months with a high rating. You can also read reviews to see what others are thinking...that&#039;s the luxury of this website. I am no seasoned vet by any means but that seems pretty self-evident. LSD is a very long commitment when you take it. It can last up to 12 hours... and it can be intense at times. I would, personally, rather do it with others who are on my same level. Just take it easy and give it time... don&#039;t try to overdo it because you don&#039;t feel it right away. I made that mistake my first time. I ended up taking 2 1/2 doses.&nbsp; :(

				I personaly find xanax to be kinda harsh, i prefer diazepam or even better clonazepam but that might be a little strong, a valium or to would be good and iv seen them pretty cheap around here on SR.
