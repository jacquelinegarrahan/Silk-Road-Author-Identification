				so i was reading a post by nedflanders and after doing so ill be switching to TAILS boot drive usb stick. In his post he gave 5 extra tips for security. One of them said <br /><br />&quot; Get GPG and learn that shit! Encrypt everything! &quot;<br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard of GPG, but i&#039;ve seen numerous mentions of PGP encryption. Are they one in the same, or is one different? Either way, where do I get it? Or should I just wait until I finish downloading TAILS which has built in PGP features I guess? <br /><br />I know what encryption is ( in the most basic sense ) and from what I gather PGP encrypts messages sent back and forth while your on the tor network ( and maybe even clearnet? idk) So anyways when I finish this TAILS boot drive I would like to be able to encrypt a majority of the files on the drive, no matter how irrelevant to any suspicious activity i may or may not be engaged in.&nbsp; Can I use PGP or is it GPG? To encrypt basic files on my thumb drive, or even use them on my home pc (which runs vista :p ) to encrypt common file types or even folders? <br /><br />Is there any software out there to encrypt common file types/folders? Id like to know even if they are windows or linux specific because I believe it to be a invaluable tool in this cyber age. I know i use a program called &#039;&#039;trend micro titanium security&quot; or something like that which I can use to encrypt folders in windows, like on my desktop. I was even using a word processor for a while that gave me the option to encrypt the text called &#039;Atlantis word processor&#039; but my trial expired. <br /><br /><br />anyways.&nbsp; <br />Encryption: <br />where can i get software for windows/linux to encrypt basic file types/folders<br />what can I encrypt<br />
