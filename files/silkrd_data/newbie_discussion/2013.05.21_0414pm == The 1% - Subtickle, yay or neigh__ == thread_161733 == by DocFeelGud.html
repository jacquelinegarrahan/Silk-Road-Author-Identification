				This guy subtickle has FAR AND AWAY the best bulk mdma deals I&#039;ve seen so far, but requires FE on all larger orders. He is ranked in the top 1% of all sellers. Has anyone had an overtly bad experience with this vendor? I fully understand the dangers of FE, so I don&#039;t need posts of reasons not to do that. Looking for personal experiences with the vendor, particularly if someone had one or multiple bad ones. His profile reviews are immaculate. <br />~DocFeelGud~

				Yeah I&#039;ve only read good things about subtickle.&nbsp; I am still new and looking for an LSD vendor and subtickle ranks as one of the better ones on the avengers thread.&nbsp; Great forum presence too, after reading many of subtickles posts it seems they took a huge hit during the btc crash but didn&#039;t go canceling orders on their customers they said they lost around 20k or something so they must do alot of business.&nbsp;

				Have bought charas 4 times and acid twice from subtickle (he&#039;s out of stock of the charas at the moment, boooo) and the gear has been fantastic and customer service great, in my experience.<br /><br />Ordered 5g charas on the very afternoon of the last BTC crash. Having had fine service from him before, I sent a PM as the BTC price went through the floor, saying I wouldn&#039;t mind if he cancelled the order because it seemed to me unfair that he might lose money on the trade when he seemed like a stand-up guy. He refused to cancel and sent the charas anyway!<br /><br />That&#039;s why he is on my favourite vendors list!<br /><br />So that is my experience with him and I would hope that that level of fairness is till his MO.<br /><br />Take care.

				Subtickle is a great vendor with a solid reputation and you&#039;re doing the right thing by being cautious before choosing to FE for him. Just remember, no matter how reputable a vendor is, you FE and you have zero protection.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend dealing with a vendor over time with smaller amounts to form your own decisions on their reliability and trustworthiness, at the same time building their trust of you which may avoid the need to FE on bigger orders.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to wait and are happy to take the risk, go for it! It will probably work out just fine. However it&#039;s all on you friend.<br /><br />Laissez-faire!

				I apologize my late answer, I have been a bit busy lately, but I FE on a bulk order, and had it 3 days later at my footstep and I have no complain to either the product, mail time or stealth..<br /><br />Only complain is having to FE :)

				I&#039;ve ordered from him and he is true to his word.<br /><br />His stealth packaging is professional and product is great.<br /><br />Yes the FE requirement is a bitch and Yes it is zero refunds but unless you&#039;re from Oz or somewhere where customs is a bitch, you should buy as the dude always deliver.

				YAY! My first transaction on the road was with him. Really beautiful 2c-b experience. It&#039;s a bummer that now he just do large orders, I loved everything about his service (shipment, stealth, quality, price...).

				If he&#039;s in the top 1% of SR vendors I would trust him with my life, much less some drugs.<br /><br />Although the warning is, never FE! Maybe you should buy a smaller bulk order from him, still bulk. Finalize early, see what&#039;s up. If everything is good then make the macho grande order of your lifetime.<br /><br />That may be overkill though, as he is in the top 1% of vendors.

				FE helps to keep the money moving quickly. With him I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything to worry about unless your country has stringent customs procedures.

				I think FEing is NOT a bad idea, so long as the vendor is an experienced one with pristine reviews. I&#039;ve already spent nearly 6K and the only bad experience I&#039;ve ever had was one inside escrow. You should always be cautious about who you FE with, but to say never FE is nonsense.

				^^ What Laissez-Faire said<br /><br />Start small.&nbsp; Build a relationship and make a decision bases on your personal dealings with the vendor.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get caught up in the moment.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; Smart buys will always prevail over the get right quick&nbsp; schemes.&nbsp;
