				Hi everybody, I&#039;m new and just received my first package and it is awesome. I&#039;m so glad I can avoid all the street dealers (losers) and <br />this opens a world of possibilities, many thanks DPR!<br /><br />As an IT specialist with a couple of years of working experience, I have put up and maintained some of the largest websites in Belgium, and will continue to do so. I specialize as mentioned in the web industry and can write any main language at a professional level. These include of course HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/AJAX, PHP, RUBY and all it&#039;s biggest frameworks. Furthermore I am a Google certified marketeer. <br /><br />I hope there is maybe I way I could help (and come up with a way to assure everyone&#039;s safety, and anonymity). Would I have to proof myself first? Is SR even looking for a programmer who can professionalize every little aspect? I&#039;m curious but off course: I understand that this could be &#039;not done&#039; (asked). <br /><br />Encapsulator<br /><br />EDIT: forgot to mention my linux and shell scripting skills, and some other minor things

				cant be that many it-specialists that built some of the largest websites in belgium. (and are a google certified marketeer)<br />be careful and dont &quot;out&quot; yourself like that. <br /><br />just a friendly advice.. (but maybe im just paranoid lol)<br /><br />anyway, nice to see people that are willing to help the community out!

				I am sure you can find out new ways to keep the anonymity bar level up..I would suggest the first way is to be regular in the forums- listen to what users and vendors gotta say as concerns, opinions etc just to have an idea..and work your way up, man!..<br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Peace,<br />idUkkU :)

And the name of your dog, you only use 3 ply toilet paper and have been swimming out in the ocean with a school of the rarely seen vegetarian sharks.&nbsp; ??? <br />Mate, I would delete your post and start from scratch. Take the time to read the SR Wiki, Buyer and Seller&#039;s Guides and F.A.Q. before posting anything else. You may be skilled in programming but you need to work on the anonymity part.
