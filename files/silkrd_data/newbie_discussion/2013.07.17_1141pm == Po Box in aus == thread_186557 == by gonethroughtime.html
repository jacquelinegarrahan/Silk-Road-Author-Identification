				I know everyone seems to say how much of a bad idea getting a PO Box under a fake name is, mainly from the obvious of giving fraudulent information. But if you were to acquire the 2 forms of identification (fake ofcourse) do you think there would be any back ground checks before they give you the keys?<br /><br />In aus we dont need photo ID either. Just 2 x bills/bank statements showing address..<br /><br />I mean as long as they approve it then and there, how do we know that they dont call up the bank or electricity company to confirm you are who you are?<br /><br /><br />Just wondering if any one had any thoughts on this..

				They don&#039;t check your details out unless they have a scanner which verifies the bill, which the post office has as you can scan and pay bills there, I am unsure if they scan the documents on these machines to verify the authenticity of your documents when signing off on a PO Box. <br /><br />In the instance of a controlled delivery, being found to have a fake identity on the PO Box you are using will almost single handily kill any doubt you can build that you knowingly order illegal items.

				yep i completely agree with you on the controlled delivery part. There is no way to get out of that one. But assuming someone would actually take out a PO box under a fake name, to commit a criminal offense straight away would surly make sure that no one is every watching right!!<br /><br />I wouldnt of thought they would have a scanner to check the authenticity of documents but who knows.. <br /><br />thanks

				Perhaps an alternative to your idea is to use a mail forwarding service, one who allows you to provide them with the box/bag for re-package. <br /><br />You have them hold one or more deliveries and then repackage them into a bag or box that will jam tracking signals if their is a chip etc or you have one of the packages sent include a jammer.<br /><br />The next address it is sent to should have forwarding registered with the post service and often the combination of LE following the package via gps along with monitoring receiving address can be defeated.<br /><br />i am not sure the extent of Australia&#039;s LE tracking systems as I am not from here I just live here now but that system has railroaded more than one attempt in the past in the States.<br /><br />I guess you&#039;d want to be on the move when you open the packages and toss anything that could contain a tracker in it out the window :D
