				Gonna be using SR for the first time. What&#039;s the best/easiest method of turning my money in the bank into BTC? Also, how do I shuffle in SR? How&#039;s the communication work? Finally, if someone can help me with a little GPG practice (I think you gimme a public key, I encrypt some random message, and you lemme know if it came out right) so I know I don&#039;t send the guy jibberish, that would be rly appreciated!! (And I&#039;ll +rep you if I&#039;m able to do that already). Also, sorry for the new thread... multitasking.<br /><br />edit: gonna use the sticky***

				It&#039;s not just Americans that love localbitcoins, everyone does.<br /><br />If you send direct to SR, then the tumbler will not hide that (it will only hide what transactions your bitcoins went to). There&#039;s nothing necessarily illegal about sending bitcoins to SR, so it&#039;s personal preference whether you want this fact to be public or not. If you want to completely hide the destination of your coins, then the cheapest option is to create a wallet on blockchain.info (doesn&#039;t matter if done through tor or clearnet). Send your newly-bought coins to blockchain, then do a &quot;Shared Send&quot; to get them to SR. Blockchain charge 0.5% commission.<br /><br />An alternative to blockchain is to use bitcoinfog, but they charge 1-3%.

				I vote for localbitcoin as well, then create a online (or offline) wallet and transfer your bitcoins to. From there u can transfer them to SR.<br />From LB to the wallet the transaction usually goes within a second. But don&#039;t get stressed out if ur btc doesn&#039;t show up on SR for an hour or so. SOmetimes it takes time, but they will come to ur account, be sure.

I&#039;m not localbitcoin-savvy yet but I&#039;ve only been finding prices well above the real exchange rate which is what had me wondering why ppl love it so much.

				I like localbitcoins because it&#039;s just easier to use, and you can literally have coins withing 5 minutes of visiting the site for the first time. I tried signing up to an exchange or two in my early days, but either it was a pain in the ass getting funds into the exchange account (takes quite a few working days for the various banks to process the transfer), or the exchange flat out ignored my application.<br /><br />Regarding cost, I found it used to be more expensive than exchange rates, but now it&#039;s very competitive (at least in UK).
