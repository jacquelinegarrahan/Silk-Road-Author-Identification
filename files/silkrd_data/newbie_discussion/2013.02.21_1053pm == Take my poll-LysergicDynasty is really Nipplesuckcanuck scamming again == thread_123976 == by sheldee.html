				I&#039;m not sure who Nipple is but I so far I have no reason to think LysergicDynasty is scamming me. So far the transaction has seen several problems and delays all on his end. But he has admitted to his errors and I have no reason not to think he is not correcting the problems. He did not ask me to FE when I first ordered with no history myself at that point (him either and I knew he was new on the road and there might be problems as such). He also offered to refund the btc and still send the gear after his first mistake so that I could test it out. I&#039;ve yet to receive any mail from him and will update when I do.<br /><br />EDIT: ORDER HAS EXPIRED AND SR STAFF REFUNDED THE BTC IN ESCROW. After right under a full month, I&#039;ve yet to see any package. The order expired and staff refunded my btc. Should a package arrive I will Update again, and also send vendor the btc.
