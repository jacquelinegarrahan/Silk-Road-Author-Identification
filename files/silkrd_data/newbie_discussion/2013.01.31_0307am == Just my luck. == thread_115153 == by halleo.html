				So I&#039;m new here and find a vendor who will work with me on some domestic molly.&nbsp; Supposed to have the best shit.&nbsp; Turns out I misunderstand a line on his vendor profile, and now I&#039;ll be waiting 2 whole weeks just to get the package at the earliest.&nbsp; Well shit.&nbsp; Now today I come on and cant find any of his listings. Vendor profile; gone. Almost crapped my pants thinking I&#039;d been had.&nbsp; Anyway, before freaking out and sending a nasty letter, I did a search here on the forums.&nbsp; He&#039;s(she? who knows right!) had an issue with a buyer and his accounts been frozen or some shit by the admins.&nbsp; <br />Now this guy has a good rep here, and I ain&#039;t shit; so I&#039;m not gonna drop his name.&nbsp; Probably a misunderstanding and everything will work out fine.<br />I&#039;m just saying I couldn&#039;t have worse luck unless the damn party v&amp; was waiting for me outside.<br />At least I didn&#039;t FE right?<br />Thanks for listening to me rant... I need the posts. ;)<br />halleo

				Honestly, putting the vendors name up is not going to do anything. Also, I would check on your transactions. If there is still information is there about the order, have faith. You ALWAYS need to research vendors on this forum because there are those who are scammers and are looking to pocket our hard earned money. <br /><br />

				yup, in transit.... but not shipped. :/<br />Anyway, he&#039;s been good about getting back to me with my messages; clarified the shipping thing earlier.&nbsp; I almost freaked out and sent another message re the missing profile etc, (vendor rating gone too) but this is an inconvenience for me, probably a catastrophe for him, so I decided not to add to the numerous messages that I am sure are filling his inbox from people with outstanding orders.<br />halleo
