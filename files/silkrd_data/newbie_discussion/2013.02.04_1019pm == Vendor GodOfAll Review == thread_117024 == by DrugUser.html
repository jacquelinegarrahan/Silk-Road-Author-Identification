				Because the site is messed up for me right now and I can not leave feedback for my purchase I will do so here. If anyone is new and looking for a good coke vendor look no further than the legend himself, GodOfAll. <br />This vendor was very communicative with me while I waited six days for a priority package to arrive. It was USPS&#039;s fault not the vendors.<br />So communication is a 5/5. Shipping also a 5/5. Now for the quality of the product. Quality is definitely good, not amazing but very good and very clean since it has been acetone washed. I wish the prices on SR for coke were cheaper but it is what it is. If you want some quality coke that wont leave your nose burning or stuffed up GOA has got it. He was a pleasure to deal with even though I panicked when my package never arrived, GOA is legit and a stand up dude. I wish GOA nothing but success here on the road.

				I agree, very good product and reliable vendor.&nbsp; Fast shipping (3 days) to Southeast USA.&nbsp; Washed product was new to me, I thoroughly enjoyed it.&nbsp; I will be ordering another 1/4 soon!
