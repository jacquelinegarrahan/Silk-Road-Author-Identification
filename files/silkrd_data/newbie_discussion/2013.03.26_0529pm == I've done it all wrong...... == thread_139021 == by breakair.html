It&#039;s all been frosty, Jack.<br /><br />I did one thing that may or may not be in the FAQ, that ppl on the forum may or may not advise you to do but that I will advise here:<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />USE YOUR COMMON SENSE!<br /><br />If a vendor has 99% out of over 300 transaction, is in the top 3% of vendors, has 400 fans and lots of good reviews on the forums, FE, just FE FFS! the vendor obviously has a &quot;way&quot; of getting his gear to your door, buy something small to test things out, don&#039;t piss and moan about it, the conditions are open reading..<br />

				<br />Don&#039;t forget the vendors are people and some of them are out to scam you, no doubt, but the vast majority are just trying to make money out of a contact they happen to have. In any business the repeat customer makes for strong revenue over long periods and vendors with high % scores over many transactions are obviously retaining customers at a high rate.

				<br />I personally believe the chances of LE finding your shipment are very, very slim.<br />This works simply because it is so innocuous, the object is to HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT, in the mail.<br />

				&nbsp;I can&#039;t even estimate how many business letters enter the European mail system every day, how many statements, pay slips, credit collectors fishing letters, bills, personal mail, reminders from the dentist etc etc etc etc. Never mind junk mail... They can&#039;t possibly check even a tiny fraction of those so I use my real name.

				<br />&nbsp;If you&#039;ve been at your address for any length of time, the postie will notice an incorrect name on the envelope and right away, you&#039;ve changed up something that didn&#039;t need changed up. He will look at the letter again to make sure he can still read, he may wonder for a second who this new person is, or why a person who seemed to have left has returned, the important thing is that you made something unusual happen on his round and you don&#039;t want that. The second time he looks at your letter might just be the time he notices the foreign stamps..... If you use a false name, particularly if you live in flats, then, in my opinion, you are begging for a non delivery.

				<br />Create a simple smokescreen for yourself. Luckily for me, I live in a shared house with other people who are Ebay/Amazon freaks, so this is done for me.

				<br />Order stuff, lots of cheap, small insignificant stuff;&nbsp; iphone charging leads, plumbing fittings, pens (pens are a favorite of mine, those companies that produce and sell trinkets for reps to give out. E.G. pens, key rings, torches that are pens, pens that are key rings etc.are always keen to send a free sample or two. Companies that make business cards do the same.), small items from Amazon, books, whatever.. Lots of small insignificant stuff Aim to have something arriving every couple of days, from as far afield as possible. Pretty soon your postie won&#039;t give a toss what he&#039;s got for you, so long as it fits through the letter box. Lots of people all over the world are hooked on buying crap (also known as collectables) from these places, the postal system is awash with junk and it makes a perfect place to hide. The more tiny packages your postie has for you, the less chance there is that he&#039;ll notice one of them has tulips and windmills on the stamps, savvy?

				If you live with your mom, or a nosy family member or other busy-body, or in a college dorm or something like that, its probably best you wait until you have a place of your own before you mess with drugs.

				<br />If you live down under, there is a strong chance your package will be intercepted. Either that, or most Aussies are gigantic chancers and all the stereotypes held so dear by us in the old world about the lineage and dubious character of the Antipodean are true.

				The best practice is absolutely to use your real name and address.&nbsp; 100% agreed.&nbsp; Never use a fake name that only increases risk.<br /><br />BUT I 100% disagree on not using PGP.&nbsp; I agree with you that the chances of LE intercepting your package are relatively low, and you make many other excellent points about the mail.&nbsp; But the reason to use PGP is completely separate from this:&nbsp; assume SR is compromised and LE gets access.&nbsp; All addresses that are not encrypted will be the low hanging fruit they begin hacking at.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to be one of them!

				You should (almost) always use your REAL name, and of course you should use your real address, where will it go if you use a fake address lol?<br /><br />Whose been convincing the forum that you shouldn&#039;t be using your real name.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shame on them
