				Anyone ever use this vendor for buying BTC? His rates are really low and has all 5/5 reviews but they may be faked.

				I&#039;m a little bit concerned myself. I just received this message from him about 18hrs ago after placing an order:<br /><br />&quot;Unfortunately we have hit a snag and we will have to cancel all orders that use moneypack as a payment method at this time. We&#039;re sorry for the inconvenience. We should have the issue resolved by tomorrow.<br />Thanks, CK&quot;<br /><br />UPDATE - June 22, 2013:&nbsp; He DID NOT take my MP code and ran, thank God.&nbsp; I know b/c I was able to purchase BTC from another seller (vicious86) w/o any issues using the same MP code.

				So I needed BTC fairly fast, saw this guy and he has the lowest fee. Now I have never done a purchase of BTC this way but with bitinstant down at the time I saw no other option and need coin badly. So he says he works mon-fri 9-5 pst. I&#039;m in est. at about 8am on 6/21 (friday) i sent a message asking a few things.... Still at 12pm my time I had no response. so at 12pm est (9am pst) I place a order. I get on later in the day around 8pm est (5pm pst) and they had read my messages but didn&#039;t respond! (After that I think I sent another message about a FE things. Well I wait 24hrs..... Nothing. So I start thinking ok maybe he doesn&#039;t process orders until mon if place Friday....(even tho he had a full work day 9-5 on Friday to process my order....) so I message him again...nothing.... It&#039;s now 48hrs and no coin.... I finally call moneypak and they tell me the card had been cashed out at 10pm on the 22nd.... So wtf? Well I message him again telling him that I spoke with MP and that they obvs have money so why don&#039;t i have my coin. Well I start thinking ok well Monday it has got to go thru..... Well I is now 2:30est (11:30pst) and nothing.... No coin no money on my MP. I am out about $130USD.... Have sent several messages today and none of my messages (about 8) none have been read or replied to..... I am very very upset/disappointed. All I can say is DO NOT USE THIS DUDE! He is a straight scammer. They&#039;ll take your $$ and that&#039;s that&#039;s. for the same of your $$ and SR experience don&#039;t use this dude. Don&#039;t let the 7% fee entice you . Just don&#039;t want anyone else to have to go through what I&#039;m going thru.

				Woah hang on here let&#039;s reserve the label of scammer and cheat for people who you&#039;re reasonably confident are cheating you!&nbsp; I had a good experience with cryptokeeper- got my money by the end of the day (PST).&nbsp; Give the guy (or girl) at least 24 business hours before you trash their reputation.&nbsp; &nbsp;My transaction went well.
