				Hello,<br />I&#039;m a pastry chef (pâtisserie) and I wish to provide SR community with a variety of baked goods containing high content THC oil or butter. I would like to ask you what food products you would like to see listed on SR?<br /><br />I will start with delicious dark and milk chocolate brownies using a French recipe (two different types depending on whether you prefer the dark or not. In France dark chocolate is used for all recipes which might be considered too rich for some). <br /><br />Other than brownies what would you like to see listed? I plan on doing specialist French recipes of my own but if there&#039;s anything specific that you like, I will whip up a few practice batches myself for a few weeks and I will add them to the product listing.<br /><br />Thank you.

				I wonder if you can make a chocolate that is actually delicious, i.e. not noticeably greasy.

				We desperately need some EU vendors who will make that kind of stuff. If you can provide in EU, you could have a lot of business.

				Two problems you&#039;ll have to think about: first is that the packages with get smashed and thrashed in transit. Second is that they will be stored/transported for days (making your foods stale) in hot conditions.<br /><br />That being said, something with good dark chocolate would be fantastic. Dark chocolate, caramel, and sea salt. Make some magic happen and you&#039;ll be a hero.

				We&#039;re also planning to enter the edibles market in the near future, although our quality won&#039;t stand up to someone who has previous chef experience. Beyond the product itself there are a few things I think have to be considered when dealing with edibles specifically:<br /><br />* Presentation: Will there be any packaging at all which indicates the product by graphics, or just some kind of container without anything on it?<br />* Space: If one wants to send a package which won&#039;t require a signature the shape of the edible might have to be changed compared to how the product would look normally.<br />* Padding: Since most type of edibles are fairly fragile the type of padding will have to step up the game, but this can be problematic as there&#039;s very little space to work with without crossing the boundary for having to sign for the package.<br />* Durability: How long will the product last before going bad? Will any preservatives be used to keep it durable for a longer period of time?<br />* Ingredients: Will there be any listing of the ingredients used for the product? For comparison there&#039;s currently 32 edibles on Silk Road in total and of these 14 have written their ingredients (although one could figure it out by some research on some of them).<br />* Potency: How much is needed of the product to get high?<br /><br />As I mentioned previously there&#039;s currently 32 edibles on Silk Road. Of these 16 are Cheeba Chews variants (http://www.cheebachews.com/), 1 for butter, 3 for capsules (which only show up and ship within Sweden) and the remaining 12 are actual unique listings who ship to EU:<br /><br />Box of Cannabis Butterscotch Pops - 25qty - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d42ae57c30<br />Ghirardelli® ™ Medicinal x 4 - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/abc8841ae2<br />Ghirardelli® ™ Medicinal - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/86d65a7ce1<br />420 edible special 10 edibles, mix of 3 types - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d2389f5fa9<br />3 Rice Krispy treats(2-4 dose)per treat &quot;strong&quot; - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/49bf3f0f69<br />Delicious THC Butterscotch Coconut Cookies !! - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/893040c955<br />3 Chocolate Chip Bars(2-4 dose) per treat &quot;strong&quot; - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/36ac36eab1<br />3 x Caramel Cannabis Bites - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9bc6951a3b<br />1x Cannabutter Oatmeal Chocolate Cookie - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/90dab2af89<br />Marijuana-infused Sugar Cookies - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3c0b7f79c5<br />2x Cannabutter Blueberry Muffins - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/91235f9e53<br />10 x Jamie Oliver Canna Brownies - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/07395fa98f<br /><br />Now there are of course more in total on Silk Road but those are only shipped domestically and won&#039;t show in the listings. Some vendors seem quite successful while others hardly get any orders at all. I second the notion it would be interesting to hear from some edible customers what kind of attributes they&#039;re looking for specifically from any edible vendor. :)

				Would like to see ultra healthy items for anyone who wanted to be a bit healthier. Organic would be cool. Raw vegan gluten free would be terrific. Maybe like a no bake nut cookie? Food processor with the nuts to make em like a flour... who knows... just trying to get my posts up.

				thanks for asking... i say put your heart and soul in it; do it in the ways that challenge, excite, and jubilate you! im sure that creatively applying your culinary skill to the matter at hand would be awesome.. i&#039;d prefer to see uniqueness. anything that you may normally eat could be combined with said &quot;THC&quot;.... right?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />i would like to hear how you plan to put the medicine in the brownies, etc. i am not the most knowledgeable on the subject of marijuana but i do understand that there is publicly shared knowledge on the boiling points, evaporation points, etc etc, upon the various chemicals present in the marijuana plant. again, i do not know your method(s) however i did feel compelled to strike up, if i may, some talk about your plans on getting the thc and all the other prime, desired molecules&nbsp; ;D out of the plant.<br /><br />know much about oils, tinctures, hash?
