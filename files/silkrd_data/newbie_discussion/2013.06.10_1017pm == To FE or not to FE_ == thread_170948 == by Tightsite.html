				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this subject has been debated over too many times to mention on this forum but I&#039;m hoping for some advice or to be steered in the direction on the subject of finalizing early for payments.<br /><br />I&#039;m confused as so many people preach not to FE (for the obvious reasons of risks of scams and non delivery) but there are also so many sellers that request for FE as the only way they will do business it seems.&nbsp; Some of these sellers have top ratings and comments and I know of buyers who use them which makes me happy to trust those particular sellers.<br /><br />I&#039;m also told that if you&#039;ve only made a few purchases then you are expected to FE.<br /><br />A seller I&#039;m hoping to do business with is FE only so any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />TS

				Screw that, I would never FE. FE simply leaves room for scamming to take place which puts you at unnecessary risk. I would avoid sellers who request FE even if they are top rated. I don&#039;t play that way, but it&#039;s you&#039;re choice. Don&#039;t forget this is the deep web full of potential danger, so don&#039;t take risks, end of story.

				Thanks for your quick response.<br /><br />So you are really advising that I should only buy from sellers not requesting FE then?<br /><br />Even if they have top ratings and comments and I know others who are using them fine (even seen and tested from the seller in mind)?

				actually I thought about this question also for some time. Of course first I read everywhere not to do it, in every single guide or advice.<br />but then I also read and learned how to find the best vendor to buy things you want etc.<br />So in the end I used this way to find my vendor of choice (looking for feedback threads over and over, comparing the quality and prices, wanted to have a domestic seller, etc etc). So in the end every of the last 2-3 vendors who I wanted to buy something from either didnt even sell to people who havent made an x-amount of transactions or spent an x-amount of cash yet and for that wont request FE OR they would allow you to buy as a noob but then request FE.<br />So I decided rather buying from a vendor who has a really good reputation about everything, selling, product, shipping, etc. than buying from a vendor where I&#039;m not sure about anything but just dont have to FE....<br />But I also have to say that I also could have afforded to lose the money. It was not a HUGE order but still I would have been really dissapointed of my own research what I did before if it wouldnt had worked out. It did though, and quite smooth too. To be honest, even thoug the vendor said on his site that newbies have to FE he still sent me the product without FE (only because I didnt log in for 3 days because I was not home). So I still think you should watch out but on the other hand it is nearly impossible to buy from a good reputated vendor without having a good reputation (which is impossible when you just signed up).<br />cheers.

				maybe it also depends on the product you desire.<br />But with my requirements (domestic, product type, quality) there where not that many vendors left. Actually one who I didnt trust that much, he was pretty new, not many feedbacks, no quality tests for the batches etc. So it was either him with no FE or one of the other ones.....

				yeah, I would never say the &quot;do never FE&quot; is wrong or whatever. Especially because without saying that it would be too easy for scammers plus nobody would even get warned.<br />but still you seem like somebody who makes a good research and if you know people who give you recommandations I think in some cases for the start and for small orders its sometimes ok to FE.
