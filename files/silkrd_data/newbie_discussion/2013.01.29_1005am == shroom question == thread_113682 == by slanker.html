				Compared to finding buyers in the real world, setting up drops, holding cash, and the general risk involved with selling them to someone who can trace it back to you... pretty damn easy. If you grow them you&#039;ll move them. Just don&#039;t fuck it up for everyone else. Be on your game when it comes to shipping and every aspect of how you could be tracked and caught. I would also say that if you want to move online you&#039;re probably better off letting go of your street contacts because if they give you up you&#039;re now not only trafficking you&#039;re now doing it through federal mail across state lines.<br /><br />You need to know the system inside and out. Currency exchange is important to get accustomed to as getting in and out of BTC can be daunting and a drain on time and money. I don&#039;t work outside of encryption on SR point blank so get used to it and adhere to it. Simple redundancies can be the difference between going on vacation this summer or going to jail this summer. Be creative and don&#039;t just throw your shit in a priority envelope (I hate it when I get an envelope with just a simple vacuum seal bag in it, it&#039;s almost worthless if trying to hide scent). I&#039;m still not sure that dogs can smell shrooms but regardless use a good smell inhibitor. 3M moisture barrier bags(the metal ones) are a big plus. A little cost but in real terms you&#039;re obviously growing them so you&#039;re sitting on profit. Pick up 100 on eBay for $200 or so and you&#039;ll make it back in an ounce and change with reduced risk to your operation. Use gloves when handling anything that is going in the mail (especially if you&#039;ve been printed before). <br /><br />Think long term, good luck.

				Lol I forgot about this thread. Was decent info. Most I all ready found via security and search functions. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a street vendor and I&#039;m looking to get into the trade. <br /><br />I&#039;m hopping to make about 1k a month give or take. I have done ample research on what I want to grow and how many Ill need. I also found good ways to move coins. Just the current issue that a lot of people are facing atm is the mail changes. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about getting a cheap laptop, UBS drive &amp; loading up that stealth OS. Only using public wifi when vending and getting USPS shipping labs via pdf.<br /><br />What it comes down to with shrooms they are not as popular as weed. I like shrooms because they require less space/energy to grow. <br /><br />Yeah I can grow weed but that starts to stink up the place and requires good ventilation.&nbsp; I may look into that once I get a house with a basement.&nbsp; Growing outside can be done but Id probably wait tell I get an ATV and do a good about of scouting.<br /><br />So my question is how well do shrooms move really tbh. I plan on giving out samples at my shipping costs once I get everything ready to go. I don&#039;t plan on starting this for \another year. <br /><br />Some ways shrooms see a little harder than weed but once you got the concept down its not that hard. <br /><br /><br />Some security advice for those that are new that I have read. <br /><br />Finger prints/Palm prints<br />Your ID can be identified just from palm prints.<br />Do not attempt to burn or use acid on your prints. To remove your prints from your hand you need to get 3rd degree burns. <br />Partial prints can also be used to get you too.<br />I have put 10 layers of glue on my finger. Pressing the mirror with that finger after it dried.. No print. I than went and took the glued finger and rubbed it over other fingers. The oil from the other fingers got on the glue. Upon reapplying the finger to the mirror I was still able to make out a good part of the print but hard to see. I was able to make out about 80% of the print.<br />Medical gloves can still have a print go through the latex, also if you touch the outside of the glove it can reapply the print somewhere. I would recommended a fine cloth glove that is than covered by the medical gloves Also wipe down the gloves with an alcohol wipe to ensure no spread of prints. <br /><br />Prints on paper/cardboard<br />From what I have gathered if you have got your prints on such objects you are shit out of luck with removing/destroying them. You can attempt to smear them but most attempts will be futile. Prints on such objects can last upwards towards 40 years. <br /><br />Hardware ID/ Macadress<br />Changing your hardware ID can be found here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idm1YoqSt04<br />Mac address http://www.technitium.com/tmac/index.html<br />This is info that can be logged. I plan on changing this before I get on tor every time.

				Im from the US and I do not plan on shipping to the EU.<br /><br />Also that is true drug dogs are not trained for it unless there is a special reason. Also appearance is everything. Some guy getting shrooms in the mail gets something that is hardly wrapped. Hes like o gods. Bad vendor what if there was a dog! So I will be willing to take a little more out of my pocket to ensure that they stay happy with the product.

Can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised - magic shrooms gotta smell like any other shroom, so they&#039;d be picking out false-positives all day long! Plus, they were only ever made illegal in the UK (don&#039;t know about the US) because they started selling them down Camden market and all the little Skinsesque yuppy-spawn started doing them, and they have power.<br /><br />TBH, I&#039;m not that worried about sniffer dogs; they cost so much to train and run the fuzz really don&#039;t have that many (though they try to make you think otherwise with all those cop/customs officer TV shows). The police only have something like 9 sniffer dogs for the whole of London (not sure if that stat includes customs), and many regions have none at all....<br /><br />Another really interesting thing I read was that there was a scientific study done for sniffer dogs to test their efficacy; a dog and handler were taken into a series of rooms, in the room there was a box, sometime the box was empty and had a sign for the handler saying it was empty, sometimes it was empty and said it had something in, sometimes it had something in and said it was empty, and sometimes it had something in and said it had something in. Here&#039;s the interesting part; the dog was more likely to go for a box that indicated to the handler that there was something in there, regardless of whether there was anything in it or not! Basically, the dog relies heavily on cues from it&#039;s handler, so don&#039;t dress like you do drugs when carrying and make packages look as inconspicuous as possible.<br /><br />Can&#039;t find the handler study, but I think this says it all - 80% failure rate! will post other study if I find it...<br /><br />http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/sniffer-dogs-get-it-wrong-four-out-of-five-times-20111211-1oprv.html

				I hope to provide shrooms some day on SR as well.<br /><br />first of all powdered shrooms wouldn&#039;t make any difference unless it&#039;s been kept that way out of vacuum for awhile because they will slowly lose their potency , but a little faster than kept whole because more surface area is exposed to oxygen - but that takes a few months.<br /><br />part of the problem with powdered is of course you&#039;d have to trust the dealer more since many species of shrooms look the same when powdered, or rather it&#039;s easier to tell what species when they are still whole<br /><br />the other thing about sniffer dogs, yes they can smell shrooms, but I&#039;m pretty sure this is for a specific species, psilocybe cubensis, and note how this is a very large amount, 6000 grams in a package...wtf!?<br /><br />http://www.justice.gov/usao/md/Public-Affairs/press_releases/press08/BaltimorePsychedelicMushroomTraffickerSentencedto13YearsinPrison.html<br /><br />it&#039;s hard to find if pure psilocybin powder in crystalline form is odorless since it&#039;s so rare. However it is structurally similar to DMT, LSD and ketamine, all of which are odorless in it&#039;s pure fresh state<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin<br /><br />It&#039;s more likely that sniffer fogs are trained on psilocybe cubensis, which does have a unique smell, partly because it&#039;s native habitat is animal based dung. Same thing with psilocybe semilanceata (liberty cap).Different species of mushrooms have their own unique smells. As an experienced hunter I can definitely tell the difference between psilocybe cyanescens and psolicybe ovoideocystidiata when fresh on smell alone<br /><br />So I&#039;m not exactly sure if a wood chip&nbsp; based species when dried would be detectable to sniffer dogs, but psilocybe cubensis definately is, so that would need moisture barrier bags<br /><br />I might have p cyanescens in the future and am still debating on how to do it. Vacuuming even with metal mosture bags will definately crush them and flatten the shit out of them and some specimens can be quite large in it&#039;s natural state when dried, so that takes up space. So it&#039;s either flatten to a pancake or crushed and powdered<br /><br />I&#039;d like to find out more myself. the only thing is, exotic wild species that i hunt for are quite rare compared with the grown indoors psilocybe cubensis, altho there are now two sellers on SR that have p cyanescens. but that&#039;s usually seasonal unless they have long term vacuum storage themselves<br /><br />
