				To acetyl the 6-position in morphine to make 6-monoacetylmorphine? (slightly stronger than H) found in tar, but not as much in powder?<br /><br />The chemical reaction would take place over time with just vinegar, but if we can find the catalyst we are set.

				Haha I just need a catalyst. Vinegar is only 7-10% acetic acid so something to get a right shift in our reaction. Think you chemists think.

				you could try a few drops of sulfuric acid as catalyst (or any non organic acid)

				I am graduated from undergrad so no more chem labs to raid. Where can I get H2SO4? That would for sure cause the acetyling of the 6-position to speed up without acetyling the 3-position too making the molecule useless?

				This will not work with ordinary acetic acid, you need glacial acetic acid, which has not water in it, since the presence of water will make reaction useless.<br />It is a very inefficient way of making gear, but if BTH is what you want then that is the way to go. Check out this link:<br /><br />&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin<br /><br />I give a quote so you can get a &quot;taste&quot;:<br /><br />Pure morphine and heroin are both fine, white, and odorless powders. Tar&#039;s unique appearance and texture is due to its acetylation without benefit of the usual reflux apparatus: the Wright-Beckett process substitutes common acetic acid for high-purity acetic anhydride in the acetylating process and omits the refluxing steps, making black tar cruder but cheaper and faster to produce than true heroin. It should also be noted that the percent of the remainder of black tar heroin is often other psychoactive opiate substances, like monoacetylmorphine in the form of 3- and 6-monoacetylmorphine (3-MAM and 6-MAM) in addition to the usual adulterants and diluents found in other forms of heroin.<br />&nbsp;(Note that acetyl chloride can also be used in place of acetic anydride -&nbsp; edit by Nakorx)<br /><br />The abnormally high 3-MAM content is due to the less than optimum acetylating agent combined with a different reaction time for the acetylation procedure. Varying levels of 6-MAM are due to the process of hydrolysis or from the process of using a catalyst in the creation of the product from the beginning (6-MAM being more potent by weight than 3,6-MAM or &quot;heroin&quot; proper), a natural decomposition of heroin, which is accelerated when the heroin comes into contact with moisture. In 2006, ten-year-old samples of black tar heroin held as evidence were found to contain 51% and 63% 6-MAM by the Vista, California, U.S. DEA laboratory.[4]<br /><br />The assumption that Tar has less adulterants and diluents is a misconception. The most common adulterant is lactose, which is added to Tar via dissolution of both substances in a liquid medium, reheating and filtering, and then recrystallizing. This process is very simple and can be accomplished in any kitchen with no level of expertise needed.<br /><br />Hope this helps, there is more to found in Wikipedia and it gives loads of links as well!
