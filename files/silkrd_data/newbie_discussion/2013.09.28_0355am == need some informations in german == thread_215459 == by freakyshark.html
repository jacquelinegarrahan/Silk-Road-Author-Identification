				Your command of English seems proficient enough... since nobody&#039;s replied, maybe you should give your questions a shot in English?

				i used to like learning german in school but have forgotten pretty much most of it. i can sometimes understand things i read in german but couldn&#039;t even attempt a conversation with somebody. i could never get my head around all that ein and eine, masculine and feminine crap. i had a crazy old teacher that reminded me of mrs pepperpot who used to confuse it and never gave any logical explanation on how to tell if a word was masculine or femenine. i can remember her giving us an example of how she would figure it by using the word fence. she told us she would think housewives are known for talking over a fence so that would tell her a fence was feminine. that just confused me even more. i mean how would you define a door? men and women use doors probably equally, lol.

Like you use masculine &quot;der&quot; before table but femenin &quot;die&quot; for door.<br />But Germans are insanely ocd tidy. So you have to learn such shit. <br /><br />I learn fast but I can never remember faces or names... To the point where its embarrassing. Like when I have to ask someones name for the third time. (edit: And that within the first half hour)

				yeah i just give up in the end. but to be fair i&#039;ve heard english in very difficult to learn for people who&#039;s native tongue is a feminine/masculine based language. that&#039;s why a lot of foreigners speaking english say things weird. like for example you might hear a foreigner say &#039;we did the sex&#039;. that one always makes me lol. but i&#039;m guessing it shows where that masculine/feminine thing is hard to comprehend in the opposite language. i can only image how fucked up we english speakers must sound sometimes when we try to speak a foreign language to the natives who speak it properly.
