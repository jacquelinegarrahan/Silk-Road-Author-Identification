				I am new to SR and placed an order with a well reviewed vendor for an order. I assured the vendor I would leave good feedback and be reasonable, and the vendor agreed to take my order with no early finalize. The order was placed, and the next day at like 11 pm EST the order was changed to in transit. I asked for the vendor to confirm that it shipped, which he did, he didn&#039;t say what day it shipped. The order was placed tuesday with the in transit changed on Weds the 21st. Per the vendor&#039;s policy no tracking was given. My last communication with him was on Friday night, where he responded to my message. My message was &quot;Just an FYI the order didn&#039;t get here I&#039;m sure it will be here tomorrow or Monday....&quot; He responded I am sure it will be there, no rush to finalize. Fast Forward to Today!!! Still nothing, and he hasn&#039;t even logged in and read my messages. I have another 4 days until I can ask SR to finalize. Can anyone offer advice? How long does USPS ussually take to ship a package? I mean lets assume he shipped it actually Thursday? Any advice, or helpful comments appreciated. The vendor has a flawless record of 5/5. Is USPS just slow and will the order be here tomorrow?

				Mate anything could have happened you do realise that things go missing in the mail all the time, the only thing you can do is wait to see if it turns up if not by the time the resolve button appears then click it I think you can extend the auto finalize so that doesn&#039;t happen then get the SR staff to do the resolution centre thing but be prepared to loose your coins if the vendor has 5/5 and im assuming you have little to no history then if they can prove they sent it you will loose 100% no questions good luck

				Well doesn&#039;t explain why the vendor hasn&#039;t responded. I&#039;ve sent about 4 polite emails he hasn&#039;t logged read them or responded it has been fucking days. 2. I haven&#039;t received a tracking. 3. He is in stealth mode. 4.The listing is removed as in the product is no longer offered.&nbsp; So either I bought the last one, or he never shipped it because he was out and still took the order. I&#039;ll be reallly annoyed if I lose my coins. However it was only a hundred dollars so I ain&#039;t worried about nothing. I also hope that feedback rating isn&#039;t the only thing that matters in order resolution. He could have scammed me even if he supposedly has 80 other orders 5/5. If feedback rating is all that matters it creates a peverse system where sellers with a 5/5 scam new buyers because they can.&nbsp; his communication has been piss poor. I&#039;m really mad. Mainly because it has been almost a week,he was supposed to have shipped this priority mail, priority mail is a 3 day transit time max. It has been a week. If anyone has had a similar experience let me know. The escrow has 14 days left,and 4 more before I can click resolve. I personally don&#039;t think he scammed me, I think he may have ran out and never shipped it and hasn&#039;t had a chance to log back in.
