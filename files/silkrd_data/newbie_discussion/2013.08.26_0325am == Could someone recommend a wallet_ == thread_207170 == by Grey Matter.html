				I know SR will hold your bitcoins &amp; tumble them for you, but do you need a wallet to have the coins sent to when you obtain them, before they&#039;re sent to your SR wallet?<br /><br />If so, could someone recommend a btc wallet service to me?<br /><br />If not, is there automatically a wallet associated with your SR account? How / where do I access the link to the wallet to tell the vendor where to place the bitcoins I purchase?<br /><br />Any and all information is much appreciated :)

				I used LocalBitcoins.com and that site comes with a Wallet which the funds are transferred into upon the purchase of your BTC.<br /><br />I then transferred these funds to Blockchain.info, from there I transferred to EasyWallet.org, and from there to my SR wallet. Always used a new identity when transferring between each wallet.<br /><br />Be aware that most sites have a small fee which is applied to transactions where you are transferring BTC.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I&#039;ve been trying to get the same recommendation. I use blockchain, too, but I don&#039;t like the fact that I used my primary email when setting it up. I&#039;m quite sure blockchain can figure out when bitcoin is being sent to SR.

				down load multi-bit wallet , move your coins to there and take computer offline , best method to keep your coins safe , when you move the coins to the&nbsp; multi-bit wallet get a flash drive and export key to flash drive , thats your back up wallet with coins and addresses if something ever happens

				I dont get the point of multiple transfers tho. Why not buy bitcoins, send them to a wallet, and then from wallet to SR?

				Even though I deposited cash at a bank to buy Bitcoins which is pretty much completely anonymous, I thought it would be safer to transfer it through several locations. It&#039;s probably just my paranoia getting the best of me but you can never be too safe eh? I&#039;ve also read of other users on this forum doing the same thing.<br /><br />Because these funds are all getting transferred through secure servers I suppose it would be harder for LE to track down where the Bitcoins came from. I&#039;ve also chosen to &#039;Use a New Identity&#039; through Vidalia when transferring funds from one wallet to another. Having said all that, I&#039;ve also read that buying Bitcoins is perfectly legal.

				If you&#039;ve got a system with 8+GB free and are willing to wait a full day for it to load there&#039;s always Bitcoin-Qt.&nbsp; The setup can be a pain in the ass but I got it for the extra security and control.

				The biggest security measure that is on SR, Which is more than often overlooked, Is the moment your BitCoins reach your SR account - send them to this Address Immediately to be Secured. It will secure them and send them back to your account so nobody can steal them.<br /><br />*****************************************<br />[REDACTED]<br /><br />Post something like that again and I will ban you.<br /><br />This is your one and only warning.<br /><br />ssbd<br />*****************************************
