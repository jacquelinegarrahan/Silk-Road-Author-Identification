				I had bought a few things on Silk Road about half a year ago and I just ran out. So I went to BitInstant to transfer some cash to my Bitstamp account by BitInstant has been down for a bit it seems.<br /><br />Are there any other sites like BitInstant where I can use Moneygram to transfer physical cash to my Bitstamp account?<br /><br />Thank you!

				Bitinstant has been nonfunctional since mid-June 2013. It was my favorite way of buying btc.<br /><br />To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

On June 8, 2013, they stopped accepting cash as a method of payment. Around June 10th, they did indeed roll out a new and improved looking version of their site. A day later, they went down completely. I would not be at all surprised if LE is trying to shut them down. They were so, so convenient.
