				Hi there,<br /><br />I am just wondering if I am missing something here. I just got a private message from someone who&#039;s name is &quot;ADMIN&quot; but it says that they have zero posts and are a Newbie. Is that how real administrators are shown? Is this some kind of scam/law enforcement/b.s.? <br /><br />

				Basically, they offered to help with my bond---said maybe they could get it reduced. Then, when I pointed out the &quot;ADMIN&quot; name but newbie status with zero posts, they were a bit defensive. Also, they asked that both read a privnote message and gave me the URL and asked that I respond using privnote.<br /><br />Anyone ever heard of anything like this? Privnote IS a real thing, but this just really smells off. I have not tried to read any privnote using the address they provided, as that just seems stupid.

				This was the response to my concern about their contradictory details:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Dude.. our admin accounts reset everytime we take them out of stealth mode. Didn&#039;t know its showing as newbie right now. But yes, that&#039;s why. &quot;Admin&quot; is blocked, try registering an account here or on the main site with the word &quot;admin&quot; anywhere in it, it will not work. So yes, it&#039;s one us.<br /><br />Read the privnote and please respond using privnote too :<br />https://privnote.com/n/hdmgkubldquevdnt/#efgxvapsrikkauqu&quot;<br /><br /><br />What do you make of that?????<br />

				Can&#039;t find any account named ADMIN. How do we know you&#039;re not making it up? That privnote is invalid (not read, but invalid). I smell something fishy.<br />You know.. the last few days we&#039;ve seen some really strange shit around these parts. Buyers being blackmailed, scammers making accounts like SR STAFF and Account Services and making tons of money, serious down time/maintence, issues widhtrawing money.<br /><br />Am I the only one that sees the elephant in the room here? Either 1 sophisicated person or persons is literally launching an all out war on this place (and winning), or.. creeps are coming out of the woodwork left and right.. and our fearleader leader is too overwhelmed to handle all this heat.

				Obviously it is not legitimate.&nbsp; Neither DPR nor inigo say &quot;Dude&quot; ... lol ... and they would not be providing you with a stupid privnote.&nbsp; They know how to use PGP.&nbsp; They would also not be sending you a PM to help reduce your vendor bond.&nbsp;

				Scout, I just sent you a PM with the details copied and pasted. <br /><br />InsideInf0, this really happened. I was asking for help here.&nbsp; I am just as concerned about this as you are. How the hell did someone create a profile with &quot;ADMIN&quot; as a name? Then, how did they log out, but the name remained &quot;ADMIN&quot;?? I was not sure how real admins talk to folks here; this is new territory for me, so it scared me. <br /><br />The person is no longer here. I can&#039;t find them. When I tried to send a final message back to them, I got &quot;no such recipient found.&quot; I assume that they got freaked out that I went immediately to the forum and posted, basically outing them. <br /><br />Anything else you think I should do, Scout? <br /><br />Thanks
