				so i got a couple samples of some 500ug and it was on point but way too long of a high for me as im only used to weed<br />i was literally going out to get regular weed just to try to get unhigh <br /><br />but i gave the rest to friends and they loved it and keep asking for more<br />so i was thinking about getting some but im kinda skeptical about it<br />i mean the profit margins are huge but it seems like it&#039;ll be hard finding people that would want some<br />or even people that know what it is where would i find such people<br /><br />i might just have to give out samples at first<br />is there a difference in the quality or is it generally all the same?<br />how much would be &quot;too much&quot; for one person<br /><br />to me it seems like the perfect bday present

				I&#039;m thinking more than 1mg is too much for most people as I&#039;ve read this on most vendors pages, I&#039;m interested in this substance and any information related to it too.

				There can be a big difference in the dosage depending on the source, the form, and the preparation. <br /><br />There is a source, one of the better known ones, who sells only the freebase powder. This free base is a light tan powder, which dissolves decently but not great in cold water. Some small yellow specks don&#039;t dissolve (indicating some impurity or impurities, I suspect). It is quite a bit less potent than the HCl salt. I&#039;d say maybe &gt;50% less effective by mouth and ~50% less effective by other routes. Dosing starts @ ~500 micrograms (0.5 mg) and dosages up to ~5mg are common. Multiple (large) males have snorted up to 11 mg of this freebase powder in a night causing a strong trip without any problems arising. It has also been &quot;too much&quot; for a small person to take &lt;5mg of it (causing an overwhelming trip but no physical health problems). It&#039;s said to be 97%+ purity, but I know of no confirmed tests of that.<br /><br />The HCl salt is probably just about as common to find, possibly more so. It is usually a white powder. Dosage reportedly starts @ ~300 micrograms and a goes up commonly to about 1.5 milligrams - 3 mg by various administration routes. Usually it&#039;s advertized as 98%+ in purity, but I have seen some of the HCl salt come back testing @ about 91% pure.<br />The HCl salt dissolves freely in water iirc, and I&#039;d suspect a range of other solvents as well. To be put onto blotter paper, it&#039;ll need to be put into a solvent first.<br /><br />Sometimes 25I-NBOMe (freebase [as well as HCl salt?]) is complexed with cyclodextrins (most commonly HPBCD [hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin]) to improve the solubility in polar solvents. This makes it easier to put the freebase on paper and to dissolve it in solvents for other dosage preparations. I&#039;m not sure exactly how that effects the potency, but it likely goes up in efficacy.<br />

				I&#039;ve only taken 1 tab per trip (1mcg per tab) and that seemed like a strong dose to me, especially the come up-- its terrible.&nbsp; I prefer the long duration myself so when I took real acid, I knew I found my drug of choice (lsd lasts a lot longer).&nbsp; Perhaps your friends are like me, give them a taste of real lsd.&nbsp; It is a bit pricier though.<br /><br />Like that other guy, whatever you do: Don&#039;t pass off 25i as LSD.<br /><br />25i has its own enjoyable qualities and should make a name for itself, not as another chem.
