				I just wanted to let everyone know that microbabe is not a scammer.<br />He has given everyone a refund that asked for one.<br />And his product is excellent. :D<br />If you know the taste of white mdma there will be no doubt in your mind when you do a numby.<br />Microbabes mdma has the flavor of excellence.<br />The question as to why it fails 35% of marquis tests is a question for a laboratory.<br /><br />peace love rocknll<br />phush

				Bullshit. I got straight scammed and I likely won&#039;t get a refund because I FE&#039;d early and already gave a 5/5. Straight methylone. Even changed the listing to &quot;Snow White Ecstasy&quot; and used the same fucking picture as the one used in &quot;1 g MDMA&quot;. Straight bullshit. <br /><br />Live and learn, Silk Road.

				I started getting reports of failed reagent tests, so I re-listed the product under the new name explaining this. This is not methylone, but obviously without the test results being consistent, I have been forced to rename the listing for now. And as I recall, I PM&#039;ed you 30 minutes ago, still no reply Key.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m not here to scam anyone. Everyone who has tried this product has had nothing but positive things to say. So for that reason, I leave it listed. I have a smaller sample size if anyone is curious with a few coins to play with, you won&#039;t be disappointed. And thanks Phush, I appreciate the kind words man.

				I made the account just to complain about my &quot;MDMA&quot;, yes. I&#039;ve only ever been a lurker on the forums and I usually buy my product from Europe from where I have never had a single problem. This was my first purchase from the US.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy Microbabe has responded to my PM complaint on SR. I was really looking forward to this roll and I&#039;ve been totally let down. I hope we can resolve this.

				respect to microbabes for refunding -- thk u -- <br /><br />and of course he/she didnt do anything on purpose -- <br /><br /><br />unfortunately the domestic mdma scene is soooooo bad ( like only 30 percent is true n mdma bad !!!! )&nbsp; &nbsp; n its gotten so so very bad that -- someone on this post was correct in one area when they said we need a lab to do the work up -- <br /><br />this is very obvious what 70% of domestic mdma is -- it is unfortunately mdxx -- which means its maybe if u r lucky a percentage / small of mdma and it is mixed with items such as bk-mdma n many other rc n other items -- <br /><br />the problem is the usa has not stood up to it n they accept it -- they get blue to blackj in one reagent test n they r happy with mdxx not even knowing how much is real mdma since that test will fizzle to purple even if there is 4 percent mdma in the batch -- <br /><br />true that a lab --- needs to test -- <br /><br />and a true domestic vendor should be able to send 100$ to dancesafe or us labs to test and really show what they r selling -- <br /><br />instead of what we all know to be the 84% 83 plus -- or even 90% lol ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its crazy what we let happen to us and what we accept putting into our body without really knowing it is real -- <br /><br />I send all my mdma to be tested -- and yes -- I lose alot of $&nbsp; -- buying 5grams -- testing and then throwing the batch away -- on n on -- <br /><br />im not gunna mention vendors <br /><br /><br />and this is not a new account really -- ive been on sr for almost 2 years now --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; im not mentioning vendors because as i said ussually they think its real -- n that is all they kno -- sum vendors wouldnt think to spend 100$ to guarantee n show they have the real deal ! they r afraid -- and the hardest part is they r ok with the batch because when they sell it most in-experienced individuals cannot tell the different -- or maybe would like bk-mdma or other rc&#039;s ---&nbsp; but they dont have the real pure mdma - <br /><br />please even for yourselves have other reagents -- not just the marquis so u can see the adulterants -- but plz let us all try to make this better and safer -- let us be sure n feel safe what is actually going into our body !&nbsp; <br /><br />i wish we could set up a program where vendors would really take ownership --&nbsp; &nbsp; not just refunds when it is caught -- but a standard&nbsp; &nbsp; -- all said outa luv -- <br /><br />n to microbabe -- good luk n respect for handling it ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but im sure its not really mdma as many think -- but i look forward to seeing u become the best domestic mdma vendor ----&nbsp; &nbsp; i sure hope so -- id be ur first bulk customer <br /><br />luv

				Thank you red123. And yes it is true, the domestic MDMA scene has gotten very polluted. So many times I&#039;ve been sold &quot;molly&quot;, only to be tweaking and jaw-grinding on amphetamines and a cocktail of stimulants for 8 hours. (Or just straight up not feel shit). I had been searching far and wide for a consistent source of quality mdma when I sampled this and thought I ended my search. I have been buying and selling this product on the reg here locally, and have developed quite the following. All positive reviews.&nbsp; I like your idea about sending to a lab or dancesafe, but for now, I will sell this product at a discount, with the full disclosure that although I have witnessed this pass a Marquis test, this is no longer passing reagent test consistently. I still continue to roll on this almost weekly, it makes me feel great, so why not? <br /><br />Sorry for anyone who feels shafted, it was never my intent, and I hope I reached out to everyone who felt that way (including those who FE&#039;d)!<br /><br />A few have mentioned that the product itself was great, but that no one likes surprises, and a non-positive, or inconclusive reagent test, is an unwelcome surprise, and had they known up front the reagent issue, they would have still ordered out of curiosity and enjoyed the roll. <br />&nbsp;I&#039;m working on the issue, and in the meantime, hop on this deal while it&#039;s CHEAP!

				Microbabe has refunded me the difference between the new listing and the old listing, which is a nice gesture. Although I am not necessarily pleased about the nature of this transaction, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m not excited to try this product. I was able to scoop some local &quot;MDMA&quot;...that along with my gram Microbabe&#039;s ecstasy, I&#039;m looking forward to this weekend.<br /><br />Microbabe is NOT a scammer. He/She maintained very quick and amicable communication with me, despite my being part of this &quot;smear campaign.&quot; However, in my opinion, it is unacceptable for vendors to not do their due diligence. I guess I&#039;ve learned my lesson not to 5/5 + FE for no apparent reason.

				yup real MDMA is AMAzInG !!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />its the industry in the usa -- <br /><br /><br />and honesty -- not just the vendors -- <br /><br />its amazing the trust that peepz put in what they get ... -- &quot;it looks great ... ??&nbsp; it smells perfect ?&nbsp; ??? &quot; &quot; it tastes just right&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />come on that is impossible to test in this method --&nbsp; &nbsp;that is what scared me 10 plus years ago in the rave scene in usa where the rc n new stuff started creeping but not many knew about it they were just puppets thinking that it was the bomb --- statistics in usa show less than 30 % of mdma has even a portion inside let alone pure at 84% lol -- <br /><br />I think it really is time for vendors to spend 100 on a test with each bulk batch --- <br /><br />honestly I feel some should spend when they buy from a lab -- especially above one gram --- then u know the full story ---&nbsp; &nbsp; n no one will get away with this any more especially when it is an accident n someone with less experience is trying to do good --- - <br /><br /><br />at least test all 5 reagents -- not just marquis ---&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;n that is just a small test that shows nothing but mdXX <br /><br />let us keep each other safe -- <br /><br />ALL DEATHS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY INTERNAL ALLERGIES OR INTERACTIONS --- <br /><br />LACK OF WATER IS DANGEROUS OF COURSE N PUT ON CERTIFICATE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE -- ITS THE 70% OF UN IMAGINABLE INGREDIENTS INVOLVED OVER LAST FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY !&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ll chime in here, too.<br /><br />I was one of the others that bought the 1G New Member MDMA listing, and tested it which showed Methylone.<br /><br />That said, whatever this was gave me a better roll than any MDMA rocks I&#039;ve had locally - by far. I&#039;m the one who apologized on microbabe&#039;s discussion page. <br /><br />I am not affiliated with the seller at all, and felt just as scammed as everyone else - but I tried the product and was very happy. I&#039;m making a second purchase shortly. <br /><br />It came quick, stealth was good, and good communication. Take it for what it&#039;s worth. This product does have value.<br /><br />Aix
