				The other week I was at hone with my partner. The problem arouse of what music to put on. I have a good collection of music in all genre&#039;s ( around 80 gig ). No sooner had I found a good track that we both loved I found it hard to find a track to follow.<br /><br />What would you recommend as a playlist of 5 to 10 tracks whilst on your choice of drug? I wss on mdma at the time<br /><br />I am asking this after seeing the post about what drug film is your favourite and&nbsp; then watching spun as a result. so I am going for so gold.<br /><br />Thsnk you

				I always make a &quot;come up&quot; and a &quot;come down&quot; play list. I would check out Kaskade, Armin van buuren, ATB, bassnector, afrojack...the list goes on but that&#039;ll point you in that direction. If you&#039;re in search of a musical selection for drugs like LSD or just want some music thats more down beat i would check out XXYYXX and Pretty lights( actually highly recommended trying pretty lights)

				Dubstep can be good if you get the right artists. Don&#039;t know many from the US but in terms of the UK scene I can think of, Doctor P, Rusko, Flux Pavilion, Zomboy, 501, Cookie Monstah, Stephen Walking, Kario Kingdom, Knife Party, Tristian, Eptic, Cutline and Adam F. Here&#039;s a few examples<br /><br />It will only really take you over if you have a decent sound system. Best drugs too be on when listening to Dubstep are LSD, Ketamine, Mcat, Cocaine and Ecstacy.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbUhT647M4<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2WuAPfaapY<br /><br /><br />As for weed. I&#039;ve been listening to Alter Bridge&#039;s back catalog, really good on weed. Can&#039;t beat Eminem either

E.D.M is the best for coming up. An E.D.M collaborative album just came out in the UK featuring all the best from the past few years, I&#039;d suggest giving that a download. Some other artists I&#039;d add to Mindfry&#039;s list would be:<br /><br />Steve Aoki, Stereotronique, Wolfgang Gartner, Sander Van Doorn, Martin Garrix, Lissat &amp; Voltaxx, Joey Suki, John Dahlback, Jaxxon, Charlie Bustah, Hardwell, Hypster, Firebeatz, Delerium, Crookers, Bingo Players, Billy the Kit, Basto, I could go on and on.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my two favorite at the moment, be patient, the drops are banging! <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE5I1U0blPM<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFKlnKckC84

				Music is everything on my trips. Recently had a great trip to the &quot;Mad Blunted Jazz&quot; collection.<br /><br />Whenever I know I&#039;m going to trip, I usually crawl torrent trackers for a day or two and look for something interesting. Depending how I&#039;m feeling, I might use keywords like &quot;ambient&quot; or &quot;chillout&quot; or &quot;electro&quot; or &quot;psytrance&quot;. I&#039;ll download a bunch of new stuff, and sample a few tracks from each collection I download. When I feel I&#039;ve found a collection that is put together well, is in the right vein, and would be good to trip to after auditioning a few songs, I just throw the whole collection into a playlist. This way, I can quality control my experience and at the same time I&#039;ve only heard bits of a few songs, so all the music will be fresh and new to me. This strategy always produces great results for me.<br /><br />If you really want to trip yourself the fuck out, throw on some Shpongle. Lol.
