				I have a couple quick questions for any seasoned perc users.<br /><br />My first question is, are there different way to get high off of them? Can you crush and snort them like roxi&#039;s and the old oxycontin&#039;s?<br />I know percs have the tylenol in there, so does anyone use cold water extraction to get high off of them?<br /><br />Lastly, about 99% of the percs I see on here are 5mg.&nbsp; Sometimes, 10mg and those are the one I purchased.<br />My question about this is: Is 10mg the highest that the percs go? And is it rare to find that high of mg&#039;s? Also, for anyone who takes the 5mg one&#039;s, how many do you take to get high usually?<br /><br />Thanks

				Hey dude, been using opiates for ever now..<br /><br />You cant snort percs or vikes, not having them work anyway..ive heard of this extraction method, but it seems silly to me, for that just get roxi&#039;s 15 or 30&#039;s and chop them up with a razor if halves are too much for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;If your looking for a more efficient way to ingest those, just chew them. It can make all the difference. Yes 10mg is the highest percocets will be, percocet Im pretty sure is just the same for oxycodone/acetaminophen pills. If your looking for more you need to up your game, to straight oxycodone. <br /><br />&nbsp;When im binging rather hard, and my tolerance is through the roof, it will take like 5 yellow perc 10s by nights end to get me straight. So a lot of the 5&#039;s... if you have a tolerance. Much love.

				Hydrocodone isn&#039;t effective intranasally.&nbsp; Just like alprazolam isn&#039;t effective intranasally.&nbsp; People still snort xanax because they are dumb and don&#039;t know that it only works once it reaches your stomach.&nbsp; A very crude way to parachute these pills and destroy your respiratory system.

				Just eat em dude.. One time last year I had the great idea to snort my vikes. Three hours later my nose was stuffed to hell and filled with all the fillers from the pills. Pretty stupid idea and the buzz sucked compared to just dosing them or chewing them. You can just chew them and let it dissolve under your tongue if you want it to hit faster. 8)

				If you&#039;re taking enough percs to go &gt;3000mg per day of acetaminophen, do a CWE before taking them no matter what ROA.<br /><br />The best high I get from opiate pills is plugging. This is especially true of morphine tabs, as a lot of the morphine is metabolized by the liver, so oral intake of morphine sucks. Your bioavailability is higher rectally vs. orally, so anything you take by mouth you can take rectally and get more of it.

I would think it&#039;s caused by wetting the capsule, which softens it and it simply melts and is absorbed by the mucus membranes in your bowels, much like it&#039;s melted in the stomach. The 15-20 minute time frame is enough for it to melt and be absorbed. Do you actually eliminate (poop out) any part of the capsule?<br /><br />I have also heard of people making homemade suppositories with yogurt. Interesting idea, but it&#039;s much easier and faster to liquify and use a syringe. Plus I like to eat yogurt.

				If you are plugging Percocet&#039;s...YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING LOSER....PERIOD.<br /><br />And you DO NOT need to chew those nasty things. It makes no difference. But if you believe it does...then it does for you. And do not snort Percocets...no need. Just by Roxicodone and snort those if you must.<br /><br />And if you need more then 2 Percocets to get high...you need to quit taking the kiddie medicine and go to Roxicodone. Because unless you have Cancer...you do not need Tylenol.<br /><br />And you never need to CWE Percocets...Because you can buy oxycodone. Where as people CWE Hydrocodone because you can not buy it alone...and some people love Hydrocodone a lot more then Oxycodone.<br /><br />And yes Percocet is just brand name for Oxycodone w/Tylenol. comes in 10mg 7.5mg 5mg<br /><br />

Why does maximizing bioavailability make one a &quot;loser&quot;? Maybe someone has easy access at home to Percocets. Guess what? Doing a CWE on 80 mg of Percocets =~ 80 mg Roxicodone. I think passing judgment on the ROA people choose, especially on this forum, is asinine. And no, I don&#039;t plug every drug I have, so this isn&#039;t me trying to defend what I do. I just think you&#039;re being an asshole for calling people losers simply because they get high a different way than you.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t see why cancer means you need Tylenol? I would think having cancer would mean you need the oxycodone portion of a Percocet. So let&#039;s bash people for doing CWE on Percocets and saving their liver by not taking the Tylenol. Fuck harm reducton!

				SO many things wrong with it??? Come on man you can do better then that.<br /><br />First notice how I said plugging PERCOCET...and not something like morphine that you actually already broke down and you were correct about. BUT you do not need to plug Roxicodone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now what I just said up there is the &quot;facts&quot; but the reality is you have a problem if you are plugging pills to try and get high of a drug like morphine. PERIOD. And the fact is you just need to take a higher dose to get high. You NEVER need to plug anything. <br /><br />And you NEVER need to waste your time with CWE (as I already gave the PERFECT ANSWER) on Percocet...just buy Roxicodone! But thanks for telling me that 8 percocets = 80 mg of roxicodone. How about just buy Roxicodone?<br /><br />And how is giving an honest opinion in this forum especially as you say asinine? Because I called you a loser? And yes you do plug almost every pill you have...so this is you totally defending yourself! lol ;)<br />I am not calling you a loser and being a n asshole because they do something to get high different then me. I am calling anyone that uses a syringe to put Percocets up there ass a TOTAL LOSER. I actually was not even thinking about you when I wrote this...and I was not passing judgement on you...Though I will now..YOUR A LOSER.\ <br /><br />You don&#039;t see why&nbsp; people with cancer means you need Tylenol....And you would think having cancer would mean you need the oxycodone portion of a Percocet. So you do not know anything...you are just giving your&nbsp; guess that they would need the Oxycodone portion of the drug....ok well unlike you ..I am actually telling you something I KNOW. There is a reason they make Oxycodone with Tylenol. And the reason is people that are in real pain and not just trying to get high...actually need the Tylenol WITH Oxycodone to deal with the pain. And for them (some 70+%...a Percocet 10mg with 500 or even 750 would work better for pain management then a 30mg Roxicodone would. I know it sounds crazy...but it is true. That&#039;s why I said it. And of course people looking to just get high...only need the narcotic.<br /><br />And there is NO harm reduction for someone doing a CWE on Percocets...and again it is a total waste of time as you can buy Roxicodone. But of course you come from the &quot;well maybe that is all they have in their cabinet that they can take from when there kid had a root canal&quot;. You know..poor people can&#039;t afford drugs but love to get high..so they have to shove it up there ass and they have to wast a lot of time doing CWE. <br /><br />But I do agree with one thing you said...FUCK HARM REDUCTION!!!<br /><br /><br />I do love how you said there is &quot;so many things wrong with this&quot; when in fact I have just showed you nothing was wrong with this. But of course you took offense to me saying you are total loser if you are plugging PERCOCETS. Even though I was not talking about you or Jacknhoff at all. You even went as far as to&nbsp; &quot;And no, I don&#039;t plug every drug I have, so this isn&#039;t me trying to defend what I do&quot; when ANYONE with a brain can&nbsp; clearly see that is exactly why you commented.&nbsp; You of course have every right to your opinion...as do I.

Yes, the PERFECT answer is to go to buy Roxicodone. Did you not read any of what I said? Someone might have Percocet because they have an actual fucking prescription for it. Or any other rational reason that someone could have access to Percocet. Why waste your time with CWE? Maybe because taking 10 grams of fucking Tylenol in a day isn&#039;t all that healthy? Maybe some of us, knowing we are doing enough damage to our body as it is, want to do a simple CWE to save some of our health? It feels like you are a vendor trying to push Roxy&#039;s on everyone by posting irrational logic about opiates.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And how is giving an honest opinion in this forum especially as you say asinine?

I suppose &quot;And no, I don&#039;t plug every drug I have, so this isn&#039;t me trying to defend what I do.&quot; wasn&#039;t clear enough. No, I&#039;m not defending myself because a.) I don&#039;t need to defend anything I do to you and b.) there are thousands of other addicts that plug. Some of the plug every single thing they do. This is about you passing judgment in general. This is supposed to be a friendly, supportive community in which people help each other. I&#039;m presenting facts: BA is higher rectally with nearly all drugs, CWE is a harm reduction technique. You are presenting a negative opinion that you try to pass off as fact, which is the equivalent of the government publishing their bullshit facts that&#039;s really just their biased opinion. I think snorting pills are a waste and terrible for your nose, but I don&#039;t condescend to people that do it. I&#039;ll present the facts and how to get the most out of that method, because I want to help people and not let them make a mistake by not having information. I could care less what you call me. I think you&#039;re an asshole. It&#039;s when you pose a threat to other people that I develop a problem.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You don&#039;t see why&nbsp; people with cancer means you need Tylenol....And you would think having cancer would mean you need the oxycodone portion of a Percocet.

There is a reason they make Oxycodone with Tylenol. And the reason is people that are in real pain and not just trying to get high...actually need the Tylenol WITH Oxycodone to deal with the pain. And for them (some 70+%...a Percocet 10mg with 500 or even 750 would work better for pain management then a 30mg Roxicodone would. I know it sounds crazy...but it is true. That&#039;s why I said it.

				Thank you to everyone who posted suggestions.<br /><br />I did have another question now that I read all of these posts.....Plugging.&nbsp; It is a term that I had never heard of until today.<br />I got the general explanation of what it is and what it does. But, could someone either send me a PM or just post on here with instructions on how to do this?<br />I would appreciate it as I have no clue on how to do this.<br /><br />Thanks again! and thanks in advance to anyone that informs me more about plugging

				To plug percocet I&#039;d advise doing a cold water (or room temp. water) extraction first to get most of the insoluble tylenol out, you don&#039;t need to get it all out unless you want to take a lot of percocet, it&#039;s just that you don&#039;t want insoluble things in your syringe that could clog it. Then take an enema or a syringe (without a needle), fill it with your percocet solution and squirt it in your ass. You should feel kind of a rush. I&#039;ve never done it myself but I know people that did and that&#039;s how they did it.

				Rxking, you are KING.&nbsp; Thanks for setting the oxy/Tylenol thing straight.&nbsp; Cancer patients will more likely be on&nbsp; HIGH levels of Roxie&#039;s instead of percocets, the relief of 10 mgs w/tylenol isn&#039;t in comparison the same pain relief as an 80 Oxycontin, which is primarily prescribed to cancer patients.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they are the hardest to get.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, if you are looking for pain relief, the Tylenol with oxycodone is the best&nbsp; for pain relief, and a lower dosage of the combo will work better than a higher roxie dose alone. Now tolerance grows on these no matter which you choose.&nbsp; There are ways to potentate your oxycodone so the relief/high will last will intensify a little and it doesn&#039;t require you shoving something up you butt, injecting yourself, or filling your nose with all kinds of crap.&nbsp; These are probably well known to the experienced opiate user, but the question originated from someone when seemed inexperienced, and I didn&#039;t see it addressed in the thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;Simply drinking pure grapefruit juice, taking cimetidine, and quinine (tonic water) can potentate your opiate experience.
