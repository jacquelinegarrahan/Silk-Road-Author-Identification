				I really wish a more senior member would publish this in the drug safety forum.<br /><br />I have really terrible migraines about 17-20 times a week.&nbsp; I have prescriptions for Imitrex and Treximet, but I have many headaches that those meds don&#039;t even begin to relieve.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#039;s very hard to find a doctor willing to prescribe opiates, even just a handful each month, for migraines.&nbsp; That&#039;s how I got to SR.&nbsp; So, from time to time I&#039;ve gone to the ER.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had morphine drips, which have worked fantastically, and I&#039;ve also had Dilaudid drips, which let me know I&#039;m allergic.&nbsp; I break out into hives.&nbsp; Benadryl does little to help.<br /><br />I had vicodin for a surgery once a long time ago, so I thought I&#039;d be cool with that, and bought a few pills.&nbsp; But, when I took them, I broke out into itchy hives.&nbsp; I went digging around for information and found a couple of sites which said that the body metabolizes hydrocodone into hydromorphone.&nbsp; So, my vicodin became dilaudid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know if there&#039;s a similar connection between hydromorphone and oxycodone?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to buy morphine pills because they&#039;re not nearly as strong, but the fact that I had no allergic reaction to morphine gives me hope that I&#039;m not allergic to all opiates.
