				I&#039;ve done a bit of snooping and he seems like a pretty shitty vendor. Unfortunately, it&#039;s the only X2 acid which I can afford. Is this guy any good for LSD. And if so how is his stealth and delivery time ?

				Since nobody else seems to have reviewed these yet i&#039;ve just gone ahead and took a blotter since i&#039;m usually a pussy and wait for feedback, anyway the blotter dissolved like tissue paper within 2 minutes of holding it under my tongue and had a pretty bitter taste compared to other acid i&#039;ve done. I&#039;m shitting it now to be honest in case it&#039;s dob or something, i&#039;ve let my nerves get the better of me so am probably in for a bad trip..<br />I&#039;m going to go off now, but if i don&#039;t check back within a couple of days something was really wrong.

				I&#039;m a very inexperienced tripper, so as you can guess 30 hours is far to long and terrifying for me. I ended up taking 2 blotters as didn&#039;t feel anything after 2 hours, which was incredibly stupid on my part as i had my suspicions it wasn&#039;t acid. Going from my own experience, i couldn&#039;t think rationally and was so terrified most of the duration, time was moving so slow, i thought i was locked in to a permanent trip, i remember finally getting to sleep about 4 hours ago and have been up an hour now, feeling ok, but am scared i will slip back to where i was. Will check back in a few hours.

				hope all went well. i ve been getting diazampam to go with it to help me sleep and sleeping aids as well. iv been trying to get hold of xanx to but no one does single sales and ive not asked. I wasnt happy with his stuff nothing happened. it most likely NBOM at best, but still not acid or the stregth. I take one to test it wait and hour or another 15 mins then go for the second. if aint doing nothingon 2 its wanky bollocks dude. :&#039;(
