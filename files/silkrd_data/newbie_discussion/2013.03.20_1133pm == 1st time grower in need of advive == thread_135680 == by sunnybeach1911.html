				You&#039;re gonna need about £200 start-up cash. Excluding seed price.<br /><br />Despite what people say, growing weed is a piece of piss. You just need to do a bit of research and not cut any corners.<br /><br />*clearnet*<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Join this site - http://uk420.com/boards/ <br /><br />2. Buy this book - http://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/187882323X <br /><br />3. Buy your equipment here - http://growell.co.uk/&nbsp; <br /><br />4. Buy seeds here - https://www.cannabis-seeds-bank.co.uk/ <br /><br />BOSH. Done.&nbsp; <br /><br />_______ <br /><br />I&#039;ve personally used growell and attitude seeds, and they&#039;re both legit.

				Buy best seeds you can find and don&#039;t handle them after germ, use the correct method - no paper towel. Avoid clones unless you really know the grower well, you don&#039;t want to start off with someone&#039;s problems - disease and bugs. Make sure your area has fresh air and proper circulation. Use a fan to help strengthen stems and use it early on. Use a good carbon filter. Keep humidity correct. Don&#039;t over water! Don&#039;t over-or under fertilize! Don&#039;t take your plants too early, lots of weight forms in the last couple of weeks. Flush when the pistil are a little brown. After your plants stop growing when pistils are mostly brown harvest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Since you&#039;re a noob I would suggest soil for simplicity. Maybe a soil/coco-coir mix.<br />And as xpsbud said. DON&#039;T OVERWATER .

Not one bit. The air won&#039;t magically combine with the toilet water and flow away. (Ō_o) <br /><br />You need an extraction fan and a carbon filter. The fan sucks the stinky air through a tube into a carbon filled box, of sorts. Which cleans the air, removing the smell.<br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about the smell, which tbh you should be, then you must get a carbon filter. It&#039;s essential. And don&#039;t just vent the air outside without a filter either. The whole street will be able to smell it.<br /><br />It sounds like you are a total noob. Which isn&#039;t a bad thing, but you really need to do your research. <br /><br />Start off small, like in a wardrobe or something with 2 - 3 plants.<br /><br />Visit the links I posted above.<br /><br />Carbon filter carbon filter carbon filter. <br /><br />

				Get yourself over to UK 420 forum. That&#039;s where I learnt all my skills. They have their own shop called Greens Horticulture who are nice and friendly and really stealthy with the packaging. Get yourself a grow tent and DON&#039;T forget the carbon filter. You&#039;ll be looking at £400+ for all the gear. Pros hate them but for a beginner auto flowering strains, such as Speed Devil, are really simple to grow for the novice. <br /><br />One of the biggest rules of growing is DON&#039;T TELL ANYONE. Not even your best buddies who you smoke with because word gets around so easily and you&#039;ll soon get nicked. People love snippets of gossip like bragging about a mate who grows. Always remember if you can&#039;t keep it to yourself how the fuck can you expect anyone else to?

Already got the holes for filters, intake etc, it&#039;s light-proof and easy to hide. They ain&#039;t cheap though, which is why I suggested converting a wardrobe. But meh, horses for courses. ;)

				lol, it was only a tiny bit of shit. ;) <br /><br />Keep your light on during the day. Off at night. Depending on your cycle. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about choppers picking up hotspots with thermal cameras, then there are solutions to this. For instance, instead of HiD lighting (hps etc.. ) you can use CLF bulbs, which run at a MUCH cooler temp. <br /><br />You can also get lights with air coolers built in. Or you can use some decent fans aimed at the light to reduce heat.<br /><br /><br />Tbh though, the smell should be your biggest concern. As the plants grow, you will become used to the smell, but believe me, the house will STINK withough proper filtering.<br /><br /><br />

				if you&#039;re renting some room with free electricity in some highly populated place the best money you can spend is on a good carbon filter <br /><br />carbon filter is worth every penny,&nbsp; make sure to go oversized.
