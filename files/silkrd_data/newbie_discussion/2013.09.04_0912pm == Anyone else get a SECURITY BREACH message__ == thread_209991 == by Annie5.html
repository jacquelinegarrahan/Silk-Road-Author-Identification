It is very important that you follow the below instructions to eliminate potential harm to your account that this may cause. Please very carefully read/execute the following step by step procedure before any further actions are conducted on the MarketPlace. This procedure will create a temporary secure account which will eliminate your vulnerability to this such act.<br /><br />STEP 1 - You must immediately change your PIN number.<br /><br />STEP 2 - You must then change your passphrase/password.<br /><br />STEP 3 - You must transfer the balance of your account to your new/temporary account - using the &#039;withdraw Bitcoins&#039; feature located in your account settings.<br /><br />------------ Your Temporary Wallet Address is - 14XVu1douShyXEQLGPpy1Gn5UbAm7mQUwi<br /><br />STEP 4 - To Access your Temporary Account - simply login as you normally would - making sure the URL is - silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - But instead of your username being - ------------ Annie5 - Your new/temp username is - #21477Annie5 - And your recently changed Passphrase/PIN will be active with this account.<br /><br />STEP 5 - Once you have accessed your new account - then once again change your passphrase and PIN.<br /><br /><br />We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused - Regards SR Support.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Im wondering if this is a phishing scam in itself, because theyre telling me whet to do, and giving me a temporary wallet address,, which deffinately hints at something.. <br /><br />what do you guys think??

				Hi, i think this has just happened to me. I logged on as usual and noticed a message from&nbsp; sr stating that due to phishing scams at the moment including my account i must change my password,&nbsp; my passphrase and pin no. asap then xfer any balance to temporary account. fortunately i only has 0.0655 btc left, but i cannot get back into my account now. So i guess ive been done over. What do you think?
