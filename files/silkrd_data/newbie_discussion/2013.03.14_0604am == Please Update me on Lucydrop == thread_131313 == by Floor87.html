				Half the forum is saying LD is back in business after a minor hiccup, the other half is saying he&#039;s gone for good and that SR staff is already handing refunds out.&nbsp; Which is more likely to be true?&nbsp; Also I placed an order on Sunday night, how screwed am I?

				Some folks on /r/silkroad are saying that they are receiving shipments from lucydrop, although I hear the quality is half as good as the other stuff he used to ship.<br /><br />What a shame, people like that are the ones who are ruining the SR ecosystem.

				I heard that LD reshipped after that happened but some didn&#039;t get their reships at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping they all come in eventually, followed by my new order.

				They are clever scammers. A very small amount of people got reships. I suppose its possible you could get lucky.<br /><br />I placed 3 orders from Jan 12- Feb 8. Only two arrived and were inactive. Lucy kept stringing me along. A week ago they said they&#039;d express me all 3 others plus extra for troubles. After rereading all our convos it seemed very clear to me they are scammers and good at it. <br /><br />As for Lucy being tony76 and tesslated i guess its a slight remote chance all 3 just &quot;happen&#039; to live the same small area of Canada (not just same country but same province and approx 20km apart) and also just &quot;happen&quot; to seem like same person and &quot;happen&quot; to sell the same products... Even on the craaaaaazy odds they are not same person they&#039;d for sure know each other. Its not like they are selling weed..<br /><br />Heh.<br /><br />Oh well karma is real and favors sudden violent assrape :)
