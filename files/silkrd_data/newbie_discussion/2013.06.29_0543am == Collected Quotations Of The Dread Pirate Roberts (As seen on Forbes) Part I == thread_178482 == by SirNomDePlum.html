				Roberts posts long manifestos, philosophical and political musings, love letters to Silk Road’s users, and even hosts the Dread Pirate Roberts Book Club, a reading and discussion group devoted to “agorism, counter-economics, anarcho-capitalism, Austrian economics, political philosophy, freedom issues and related topics.” <br /><br />A big thanks to The Pirate for trying to educate those who will listen. And if you are still stuck in newbie land on this forum I still encourage you to discuss these topics here even if you can&#039;t post to the Book Club yet. Please participate, SR is not just about scoring and getting stoned, it&#039;s so much more than that. <br /><br /><br />Here it is copied and pasted from the Forbes website in full [except without the images]. Yep that&#039;s right, I used it without their permission! Viva la Revolution 4 Ever!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Collected Quotations Of The Dread Pirate Roberts, Founder Of Underground Drug Site Silk Road And Radical Libertarian<br /><br /><br />The persona behind the drugs: On Silk Road&#039;s forums, the black market&#039;s libertarian founder tags his post with his character&#039;s signature motto: &quot;As you wish...&quot;<br /><br /><br />In public, the pseudonymous Internet drug czar known as the Dread Pirate Roberts doesn’t say much. Roberts’ website, the illegal, anonymous drug-selling black market known as the Silk Road, has survived only because of its creator’s discretion. On the rare occasions when DPR speaks to the press, he (or she) does so in short messages, and–at least in my case only through the anonymizing service Tor, the same cryptographic tool used to prevent the Feds from tracking down the Silk Road’s servers or its users. Thanks to that discretion, the Silk Road’s Bitcoin-driven narcotics trade has thrived for more than two years without being shut down by law enforcement, and its founder hasn’t been identified.<br /><br /><br />But within the community that the Dread Pirate Roberts has created, Silk Road’s founder is hardly so shy. On the Tor-hidden online forums associated with Silk Road, Roberts posts long manifestos, philosophical and political musings, love letters to Silk Road’s users, and even hosts the Dread Pirate Roberts Book Club, a reading and discussion group devoted to “agorism, counter-economics, anarcho-capitalism, Austrian economics, political philosophy, freedom issues and related topics.”<br /><br /><br />The character that emerges from those writings is no run-of-the-mill cybercriminal. (Though Silk Road site was moving $22 million worth of illicit pharmaceuticals a year at last check. Roberts instead comes across as a principled libertarian and cypherpunk in the same vein as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.<br /><br /><br />Below, I’ve assembled DPR’s writings from Silk Road’s forum on every topic from the War on Drugs to Ron Paul to his own motives and ideology. Since most readers don’t use Tor, I’ve copied some entire long passages here. But for those who do use Tor, I’ve added links at the end of each subject back to Silk Road’s Tor-hidden community forum, where you can read all of Roberts’ words in context.<br /><br />### <br /><br />End Part I, cont&#039;d in Part II
