				So, when I take my black tar (which I like more than china white = weird already), I boil a tablespoon of purified water, drop a drop of that onto a spoon, mix the tar until completely dissolved, then snort the water droplet up my nose through a straw (that&#039;s been cut down).<br /><br />It&#039;s like heroin vapor going directly to my lungs.<br /><br />Am I the only person who does this?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried smoking, and cutting the heroin up then snorting it, but whenever I do the above method, it&#039;s WAY stronger, and hits WAY faster. Too afraid to IV.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I heard that very dangerous because of the fact bth is cut with lots of stuff. <br /><br />there is a way to sanitize it, you might wanna look into that. <br /><br />I smoke it, wanna shoot it but too afraid

				Ive never had BTH only #3 and #4 but you should be very careful doing that as any fluid in the lungs can cause infections etc.<br /><br />I shoot and have only smoked once and that was only 2 weeks ago, first time I had it I shot it and have every time since bar that one. I had a fear of needles when growing up the after having a shot the fear was gone. People say dont shoot its too addictive which is a lie it is no more addictive smoking shooting snorting (plugging) weird people do that the only thing is you get addicted to the actual needle more then the gear itself. Get someone who knows what they&#039;re doing to help you the first time to try as they will be able to hit the vein etc. always use new clean everything every time always. Ive been IV&#039;ing for over 10 yrs and have never shared anything not even a spoon and to this date still have no diseases

				I grind it up with mannitol for cut and then snort it.&nbsp; But a lot of bth is very acidic so I&#039;m not sure how good this is for the sinuses.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also mixed with water and shorted it but didn&#039;t notice an appreciable difference from snorting powdered.

				It&#039;s not that weird. I know several people that do this. I tried it, but didn&#039;t get it into my lungs, just my nasal cavity.<br />It goes by a few names, waterlooping I think was the first one I read online.<br /><br />My friends use a small bit of cotton as a filter and use a syringe to snort from.
