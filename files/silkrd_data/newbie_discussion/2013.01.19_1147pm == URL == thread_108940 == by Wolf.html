				Hey,<br /><br />So, I have searched and not found anything.<br /><br />A fair time ago, then I first found the silk road. However, I had no spare money, so saved the reference, and left it for now.<br /><br />Now I have more money, but my old bookmarks no longer point to a valid page, and I have two links to apparent Silk Road sites, although apparently both don&#039;t accept new registrations, one says login failed when I try to login, the other says it is under maintenance. I don&#039;t have anything to lose if my login details have been stolen, as I said - I only made an account, I didn&#039;t buy anything, so my account is a &#039;virgin&#039; account.<br /><br />Anyway, back to my point - how can I tell which, if either or both of the URLs I have found are correct, or if neither, the correct URL?<br /><br />Wolf<br /><br />P.s. As well, if my details have been stolen, the details I used are different to what I signed up with here.

				Silk Road should consider doing what BMR have done and put a normal URL out that always points to the correct address, then if it ever changes again (the onion one) there&#039;s always a way to get here. HOWEVER, I have no idea how you&#039;d do this properly anonymously.

				Silk Road has by far the easiest to enter URL of any .onion site I have used. It is incredibly easy to either memorize, copy and paste into notepad, or just write down on paper the URL. I can&#039;t bring myself to feel sorry to people who log-in to phising sites that not only have an observably different URL, but also a different log-in page. This is not an issue SR should be worrying about.

				The point of this thread made at the start was that the URLs had changed.<br />He isn;t talking about just remembering the URL, anyone can write it down.<br />What is he supposed to do when it changes for whatever reason (and it DID change relatively recently)?<br />You have to google it (I used to use the &#039;take a trip down the revamped silkroad page) and hope you get a genuine link.<br /><br />My suggestion was just that, a suggestion.

				If the URL ever changes, we will make a thread (or multiple threads) and make sure to sticky them.&nbsp; But, the URL has only ever changed once (to my knowledge) and it was not any time recently.&nbsp; <br /><br />
