				ME!<br /><br />My favorites are:<br />1 LSD A must try for anyone who likes psychedelics<br />2 25-C My favorite of the NBOME&#039;s Gives a more real feel on the visuals less color more patterns and moving <br />3 2C-P The most colorful and intricate visuals I have seen.<br />4 DMT Is a must try too.<br />5 25I A fun psychedelic, Easy to handle, although I don&#039;t enjoy the body load as much as others.<br />6 Shrooms A lot of fun too.<br />7 Saliva Just plain too intense, Good too use to make a fool of someone. Lots of dribbling etc..<br />8 DOC To long lasting, dose can be tricky and way to stimulative.<br />9 2C-B Very fun psychedelic, easy on most people.<br />^In no particular order^ <br /><br />I really want to try Mescaline and 5-meo DMT now that I&#039;m back on the scene.

				My experience has mostly been with mushrooms. Mind-expanding indeed.<br /><br />Recommendations on what to try next? I&#039;m curious about DMT, but I hear it&#039;s pretty intese for a relatively new user. Maybe just acid? Seems like there&#039;s a lotta love and a lotta hate for NBOMe, too

				Does anyone know any good legal ones. I just got hold of synthetic mescalines: Methallyescaline and Allyescaline from rayelwood. The methallyescaline was mind blowing, it started out with a mdma-like rush that lasted two hours, then for the next 14hrs I was quite stimulated and was getting some pretty trippy color tracers and visual distortions, no full on hallucinations though. <br /><br />Allyescaline was like mushy&#039;s but a bit weeker, good to go out on and socialise lasts about 8hrs

				Theres alot of RC&#039;s already on here, pretty much all which is great. I enjoy the 2C-x range though personally as they go great with my anti depressants with les body load as normal LSD or 25 series.
