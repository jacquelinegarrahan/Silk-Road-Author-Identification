				Just to help any people new to the SR cola market, here are my experiences with the cola vendors I&#039;ve dealt with so far.<br /><br />NOD<br />An 8ball from him was the first order I&#039;d ever placed on SR. I&#039;ve picked up from him 2 more times. The prices, as everyone knows, are quite high, sky high. Customer service is beyond excellent. As slow as TOR is sometimes, he gets back to you pretty quickly and doesn&#039;t just write little blurbs. They are thought-out responses that show that he cares about his customers and his business. I&#039;ve only ever picked Express shipping and if you make the cutoff, you get it next day. It&#039;s that simple. The product comes in one big beautiful rock and little size lines give me great, smooth euphoria, no jitters, and the kind of comedown that I like (yawn, yawn, 15 minute nap, back to normal). People (including me) obviously are willing to pay the price that he sets, and I have absolutely NOTHING BAD to say about him except that somewhere inside me still cries a little bit when I pay up for his 8ball :) In any case, if you&#039;re financially ok, Nod should be one of your top choices.<br /><br />SPACEWRANGLER<br />This is one cool dude. My first order from him was just for some Xanax bars. I had just placed an order before he took down listings and he pm&#039;ed right away to let me know about his inventory issue. He is super friendly and sent me another msg once my pack was in the mail. The second order I placed was last week for some cola and xanax bars. Same little inventory issue with the Xanax but he threw in some addy&#039;s to make up for it, which was class. His stealth is fucking amazing and actually kind of funny. I saw it and it made me laugh. The cola comes in caps so for all of you that are obsessed about getting stuff in rock form you may be disappointed. HOWEVER, the cola is visibly shimmery, and the high is smooth and euphoric with a nice comedown. I hate to say this because I really like SW but I would rank his cola just a tad tad tad tad behind Nod&#039;s. But because of the price, I would say SW is the better deal. I can&#039;t stress how pleasant it is to do business with SW.. really cares about his customers and I want him to succeed so that the cola market on SR has more competition (which means better prices for the consumer).<br /><br />DRAGONCOVE<br />Sends Tracking Number right away. Bought 1g from him and product comes in little rocks and powder. People seem to be pleased with his product but, at least for me, his cola was not even close to Nod&#039;s or SpaceWrangler&#039;s. In terms of transaction and delivery, though, he is spot on and professional.<br /><br />UGS<br />Got 1G from this vendor. Shipping was on point; stealth could use a little work. No vacuum seal. Comes in a rock. The cola was good, but I would rank him behind Nod and SW.<br /><br />So, I guess the final word is if you have $ burning your pocket and want your gear RIGHT AWAY, go with Nod. But in terms of value, quality, and increments (meaning SW handles smaller orders whereas Nod only does 2G and 3.5G), SpaceWrangler should be your go to guy. Both of these vendors (Nod, SW) are legit; just depends on what exactly you&#039;re looking for and how much you&#039;re willing to spend.<br /><br />NEXT UP TO TRY IS COCAEXPRESS, who has marketed his new cola product brilliantly. The prices are the best out of all these vendors but I cannot vouch for the quality as I have not yet sampled it. I hope this helps everyone.

				It wasn&#039;t bad. I have gear from four vendors for testing--Nod, UGS (SuperTrips), and DragonCove and SpaceWrangler. Would rank UGS&#039;s stuff just a tad behind SpaceWrangler and Nod. SW&#039;s prices are similar, I think, to UGS/SuperTrips so you may want to give him a try. But yeah, if you like SuperTrips stuff, I don&#039;t see why you shouldn&#039;t just get it from UGS since shipping is quicker. Who knows if he recuts it though... it felt clean to me anyway.

				So, my list of tested vendors has increased... so far I&#039;ve tested (in order)<br /><br />1. Nod (3 orders)<br />2. UGS <br />3. Dragoncove<br />4. SpaceWrangler<br />5. Marlostanfield (arrived today)<br /><br />Waiting on:<br />6. CocaExpress (waiting for mail, but judging from some other forums, it seems like receiving it is going to take FOREVER, not confident)<br />7. ayeseadee1080<br /><br /><br />MarloStanfield:<br />This guy didn&#039;t just rack up ~300 orders with 99.8% for nothin. One of the things he does that is competitive to Nod is the overnight option. I received the product today with good stealth. Product came in 4 shiny rocks. Initial taste has me ranking it just behind Nod and SpaceWrangler, which means it&#039;s still great stuff. BUT have you SEEN Marlo&#039;s prices? The best prices on the road. I want this guy to kill it to make other vendors price more reasonably. And I&#039;d love for other vendors to be updating their page as much as he does his profile. It&#039;s almost like a &quot;day in the life of the game&quot; blog. <br /><br />In any case, my final word, at least for now, is that I&#039;m going to be shopping with SpaceWrangler, who sells in smaller amounts for when you don&#039;t necessarily want a whole ball. Nod is great, but I can&#039;t always afford it.<br /><br />

				Sprayman what&#039;s your vendor page?<br /><br />Alright guys--SpaceWrangler just put his listings back up. I know I&#039;m in for at least another gram. He&#039;s been an absolute blast to deal with and cares about his customers. The cola is 100% legit. 50mg-75mg lines are enough for a super nice, clean, smooth euphoria. In fact, I&#039;m able to drift into a nice sleep afterwards (especially if I&#039;ve had a long day). 100mg gives you that party chatty feeling with no jitters even at the one hour mark to redose. I dunno how to describe it--it&#039;s friendly coke and lets you chill. <br /><br />When I have the $, I&#039;d go Nod (who just went stealth I think). When I want good quality with unbeatable pricing, I&#039;m going MarloStanfield. When I want primo, A+ quality, little more expensive than Marlo, but with friendly, fucking customer service, I&#039;m going with the SpaceWrangler.

				SpaceWrangler is the man. I was one of the few who got to test his new batch and it is 100% fucking legit. And yeah, like you said, everything else about him is top notch as well. You can check out my full review in his review thread.

				I received my .5 from TopGear yesterday, and I gotta say it wasn&#039;t worth it. Not bad, per se, but for ~$70 a half gram I should be getting at least 4 bell-ringing shots out of it. I barely got 1. The last shot I did was ~250mg, which with primo yay should have had me stuck. Strange because it looked right, smelled right, and tasted right, but the potency and euphoria just weren&#039;t there. Did I get high? Yes, but not the kind of high you expect from primo priced cocaine. Very disappointing, especially after reading some of his reviews. This is the kind of coke I&#039;d expect to pay $25 a half for. <br /><br />I have to mention also that it wasn&#039;t jittery fiendish stuff, and the comedown was smooth. If I had to estimate I&#039;d say this is about 35% purity.

I&#039;ve picked up from him 2 more times. The prices, as everyone knows, are quite high, sky high. Customer service is beyond excellent. As slow as TOR is sometimes, he gets back to you pretty quickly and doesn&#039;t just write little blurbs. They are thought-out responses that show that he cares about his customers and his business. I&#039;ve only ever picked Express shipping and if you make the cutoff, you get it next day. It&#039;s that simple. The product comes in one big beautiful rock and little size lines give me great, smooth euphoria, no jitters, and the kind of comedown that I like (yawn, yawn, 15 minute nap, back to normal). People (including me) obviously are willing to pay the price that he sets, and I have absolutely NOTHING BAD to say about him except that somewhere inside me still cries a little bit when I pay up for his 8ball :) In any case, if you&#039;re financially ok, Nod should be one of your top choices.<br /><br />SPACEWRANGLER<br />This is one cool dude. My first order from him was just for some Xanax bars. I had just placed an order before he took down listings and he pm&#039;ed right away to let me know about his inventory issue. He is super friendly and sent me another msg once my pack was in the mail. The second order I placed was last week for some cola and xanax bars. Same little inventory issue with the Xanax but he threw in some addy&#039;s to make up for it, which was class. His stealth is fucking amazing and actually kind of funny. I saw it and it made me laugh. The cola comes in caps so for all of you that are obsessed about getting stuff in rock form you may be disappointed. HOWEVER, the cola is visibly shimmery, and the high is smooth and euphoric with a nice comedown. I hate to say this because I really like SW but I would rank his cola just a tad tad tad tad behind Nod&#039;s. But because of the price, I would say SW is the better deal. I can&#039;t stress how pleasant it is to do business with SW.. really cares about his customers and I want him to succeed so that the cola market on SR has more competition (which means better prices for the consumer).<br /><br />DRAGONCOVE<br />Sends Tracking Number right away. Bought 1g from him and product comes in little rocks and powder. People seem to be pleased with his product but, at least for me, his cola was not even close to Nod&#039;s or SpaceWrangler&#039;s. In terms of transaction and delivery, though, he is spot on and professional.<br /><br />UGS<br />Got 1G from this vendor. Shipping was on point; stealth could use a little work. No vacuum seal. Comes in a rock. The cola was good, but I would rank him behind Nod and SW.<br /><br />So, I guess the final word is if you have $ burning your pocket and want your gear RIGHT AWAY, go with Nod. But in terms of value, quality, and increments (meaning SW handles smaller orders whereas Nod only does 2G and 3.5G), SpaceWrangler should be your go to guy. Both of these vendors (Nod, SW) are legit; just depends on what exactly you&#039;re looking for and how much you&#039;re willing to spend.<br /><br />NEXT UP TO TRY IS COCAEXPRESS, who has marketed his new cola product brilliantly. The prices are the best out of all these vendors but I cannot vouch for the quality as I have not yet sampled it. I hope this helps everyone.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nice, I&#039;ll definitely try one of these guys in the near future. Some dealers want to finalize early for inexperienced buyers so I gotta be careful when I buy.

				Hey everyone!<br /><br />Keep a look out for me CannaConnection! We will be listing samples in the next upcoming weeks of our high and mid grade quality cannabis and our highest quality columbian, peruvian, and bolivian cocaine. We are starting out by selling 1 gram or less samples for all of our different types of cocaine so that everyone that buys with us can learn to trust us and can see that our cocaine connections are nothing to be touched. We can get any amount of cocaine! For our cannabis we will be starting samples at 3.5 grams or less and all of our cannabis comes from the growers of california straight to your hands. Our connections will allow us to beat all of our competitors prices for the highest quality items. <br /><br />Keep a lookout because I can promise we will be giving every vendor that serves the USA domestically a run for their money related to the cannabis and cocaine market. We are going to be taking over!

				Coke and crack suck.&nbsp; Yeah they may seem awesome at first, but you can never get enough, and your brain will make you drop everything important and do anything to get it.&nbsp; Or you can keep binging and then could have a heart attack or stroke.&nbsp; The come down is the worst of any drug, worse than heroin, so bad you wish you were dead, but you can&#039;t because you KNOW that if you did you would be tormented in a REAL HELL for-ever and ever.&nbsp; You too can become a coke head or crackhead who&#039;s only base mission is to satisfy your medula oblongata and destroy the remaining leftovers of what is you.

				I can definitely recommend Sukey if you want to buy C.<br />I made 2 orders (first the &quot;pure&quot; and second time the &quot;ultra Clean&quot;).<br />Both letters arrive in only a few days (4 days including weekend) and stealth was very good (domestic oder).<br /><br />The first C was really good, better than everything you can buy on the streets here (ger), and it&#039;s<br />100% worth the money I paid!<br />The second order of the &quot;UCC&quot; was a bit more expensive, but this C is absolutely on Top<br />(I only tried a small nose until now, but it was enough to give all thumbs up for it)!<br /><br />Also the communication with Sukey is super - He&#039;s answering every question, doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a newbie question or whatever.<br /><br />Regards, have a good time on SR!<br />pathfinder<br />

				I have also good expieriences with sukey. <br />I orders 1g of the high quality batch (called &quot;Pure&quot; cocain in the titel because he can not change it). it was about 100€ for the g but it is very nice!

				I finally got around to trying PureOrganx&#039;s blow(bought some over a week ago but was on a Tina binge when I received it so I waited to test) and it&#039;s pretty good but doesn&#039;t really get me HIGH. It looks exactly like the pictures, smells great and went down smooth when snorted. Very mild drip and I had virtually no comedown. But, aside from having an insanely numb nose, I didn&#039;t really feel much. I felt a decent rush the very first time I snorted a line but after that there wasn&#039;t much of anything and I was doing lines every 30-45 mins. I&#039;m taking a few days off to be sober and then trying it again to see if maybe I just had too many drugs in my system and that caused me to not really feel it as much as I should have. I was told that PureO had really speedy coke but, to be honest, it made me tired when I did it. I was asleep about an hour after doing my last line. Anyone have a similar experience?

				Studio54 has some of the best stuff I&#039;ve gotten on or off the road. He&#039;s also a great guy to deal with, however, he does this as hobby and has limited supply. I think his last two listings sold out within a couple of hours. Highly recommended if you are lucky enough to get an order in.

Great product.<br /><br />Second time i&#039;ve ordered from him but I haven&#039;t in a while because allergy season ruins my coke nose:)<br /><br />His coke is much stronger than most I&#039;ve order on the road. I do less and it lasts longer but Im just as high or more high. No weird shakes or other stupidity, just a nice ride, and though I&#039;ve had VERY euphoric highs from other vendors (speedy speedy mrO&#039;s coke)&nbsp; but this one seems more legit and the crash is less intense but still makes me want more...
