You know cats ?! if they roll on the floor when they feel great?! Thats how I connect the term but who knows....<br /><br />For the dosage:<br /><br />you 80KG -- take 150mg .... ORAL <br />your wife 60Kg - 140mg ... oral <br /><br />dont just lick it it destroys your teeth bomb it.<br /><br />After 45minutes it begins and after 1 and a half hour just take a booster if needed. Most say take 50-80mg ... I love to take an other full dose but this it up to you. <br /><br /><br />On tip if you take more than one booster you will have a very very sad week with lots of tears ,-)<br /><br />Have fun and stay with your partner alone. Its worth it.<br /><br />./pew! pew!

				Always test your drugs! Never take anyone&#039;s word for it. Take the responsibility. Take the large attack dose and a half strength booster if you feel like it. Supplement pre and post with vitamins.

				Its recommended a lot around here to take a small dose of GHB a couple hours after you took MDMA to ease/kill the downer of it. Some people swear by it and wouldnt do mdma alone again.<br /><br />I have GHB but havent received my MDMA yet so I&#039;ll check this out myself :P

Specifically when smoking marijuana. Smoking before or during a MDMA experience greatly intensifies this up and down &#039;rolling&#039;. Now if you do not smoke any pot untill your sure that you are back to baseline and no longer feeling the MDMA, then , when you get stoned, It will bring you right back into that up and down roll.<br /><br />Also for some one that hasnt done E in over a decade, as the OP says, my best advice would be to start with no more than 100-120mg. Seeing as how it will in fact be pure MDMA, and the tolerance will be none, that should be the perfect dose to get back in the game. You can of coarse do more, like 200-300mg, but this will be very intense and likely to cause some panic on the come up and peak, which will begin with in seconds of realizing that you feel something happening..Then even if it is not TOO intense, youve set the bar for your self very high, and if your looking to re dose in the same month, anything less than that monster dose will simply not do the trick. <br /><br />Also, in my decades of field research and experience, adding a very miniscule amount of methamphetamine to your cap will greatly extend the MDMA roll time. By miniscule, I mean no more than 10mg. Best of luck.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
