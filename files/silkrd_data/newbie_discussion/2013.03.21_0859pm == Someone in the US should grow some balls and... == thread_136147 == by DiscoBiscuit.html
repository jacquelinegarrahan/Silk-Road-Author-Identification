				Lets do it!&nbsp; You and me.&nbsp; I gots da building for the lab and some equipment, you get the important ingredients.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Yu don&#039;t think there&#039;s enough out there? <br />Precursors and reagents are hard to get in bulk for anyone .&nbsp; Might be be Better in Mexico or Guatemala and then ship to the US.&nbsp; The ingredients you need are easier and cheaper there .&nbsp; <br /><br />At that scale, pound for pound it might be better to switch to meth lab since users can keep using it continuously unlike Molly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Molly users only roll here and there and the stuff is quite cheap really.&nbsp; &nbsp;Coke may be used over and over and so can meth.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can the ingredients for Molly/MDMA then you could make more valuable things with such a lab.&nbsp; Just some stoner thoughts :-)

				can&#039;t say that I&#039;ve tried to learn the whole process, nor do I know everything that you would need for it... Honestly I figured with SR any of the ingredients would be simple to find. Maybe at a &quot;premium&quot; but still the ability for massive profit would be there. I&#039;m just saying there has to be some U.S SR user has the know-how and knowledge to do it. <br /><br />Clearly they already have a worldwide client base by using the Road. Someone doooooo eeeeett! <br /><br />please?<br />lol
