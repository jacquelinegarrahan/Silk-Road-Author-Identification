				Hello all,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to start by saying, I&#039;m not that new to opiates, I have been taking oxycodone 20mg three times a day for a number of months, as well as 200-400mg codeine a few times a week when I&#039;m out of oxycodone.<br /><br />Yesterday I got a hold of two 10/325 hydrocodone. I figured since hydro is reportedly weaker compared to oxy, I&#039;d pop both and just relax and watch some TV. Here&#039;s what happened:<br /><br />5:30 - Chewed a few times and popped two 10x325 (20mg)<br />5:45 - Start to sense that subtle warm feeling I&#039;m so used to<br />5:55 - Starting to sweat a bit, stood up and walked around, body was definitely starting to feel a bit numbed out.<br />6:00 - Mouth started to get a bit dry, and it almost seemed as though there was some sort of numbing agent in the pills, as my mouth was not only dry, but very dumb and my speech starting getting a bit slurred. Turned on the TV to watch some shows.<br />6:10 - Vision is getting blurry, body feels extremely warm but not the same way I&#039;m used to, this time it&#039;s much more sedating and numbing as compared to oxy which is much more uplifting, no real euphoria yet.<br />6:30 - I can&#039;t see shit at all, fully have double vision, I could see well enough if I closed one eye but just couldn&#039;t focus on anything whatsoever. I got up to use the washroom, definitely lost some coordination in my body because I couldn&#039;t really feel anything.<br />6:45 - Vision just kept getting worse, but now I am starting to close my eyes because I&#039;m getting a headache, but when I do I start to feel extreme relaxation, warm and cozy. But when I open my eyes it almost seemed as though I were drunk.<br /><br />I think I fell asleep after that or something, as next thing I knew it was 7:30, vision was a bit better but still definitely blurry. Massive massive headache, I took some aspirin and took a nap, woke up a few house later, still a headache, took a nap and woke up again, this time feeling fine.<br /><br />All in all, hydrocodone wasn&#039;t at all what I was expecting. If someone were to have given that to me and told me it was some sort of tranquilizer, I would have believed them. Normally codeine/oxy gives me a great euphoric feeling, as well as *improved* cognitive function, and although I can&#039;t feel much of my body, they certainly don&#039;t have tranquilizer-like effects on me. The hydro seemed much more of a downer drug, whereas oxy to me is definitely an upper.<br /><br />Anyone had any experience with the two and have similar findings? I&#039;m not sure if I want to try hydrocodone again, I really didn&#039;t like how the high was almost like being drunk (especially the vision impairment part) BUT I would definitely say the 20mg hydro did in fact have a better pain management effect on my body (I literally couldn&#039;t feel a damn thing).<br /><br />Do you think I took too much my first time? I know different opiates have different effects on people but I really didn&#039;t think 20mg would be a lot. This stuff hit me very hard, very different from oxy.<br /><br />Thanks for any help, cheers<br /><br />

				I am no stranger to pain-killers/opiates either and that does certainly sound strange. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">5:55 - Starting to sweat a bit, stood up and walked around, body was definitely starting to feel a bit numbed out.<br />6:00 - Mouth started to get a bit dry, and it almost seemed as though there was some sort of numbing agent in the pills, as my mouth was not only dry, but very dumb and my speech starting getting a bit slurred.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>However, that sounds like an OD to me. Just weird to me because for me, personally, oxys have always hit me harder than hydros. Perhaps its because when I first started taking PKs I took hydros consistently and didn&#039;t start taking oxys until later. But then again, like you said different opiates have different effects on different people..

				The most scary thing is they gave me that numb feeling in my mouth, sort of like after you eat a halls or something, and definitely found it much more difficult to talk. That 20mg of hydro hit me so much harder than even a 30mg dose of oxy.<br /><br />Do you think it could have been an allergic reaction, or simply too high of a dose for first time? This is really bothering me because I&#039;m starting to wonder if either the hydro I took had something else in it, or oxycodone just doesn&#039;t work well with me at all.<br /><br />Thanks

				Could it be the case that because I&#039;m so used to taking oxy (past 6 months almost daily) I have a higher tolerance for it, whereas because it was my first time with hydro 20mg was probably too much to start?<br /><br />Thanks

				You did say you chewed on them, which would probably explain the mouth issues. Let&#039;s not forget we are talking about a painkiller here, in other words an anesthetic. Seen people drooling off of opiates before so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s unusual.

				in my experience-if your tolerance to oxy is up some as you say-you should have hardly or not at all felt anything from the same in hydro. they were both a bit of an uplifting high at first, not at all like you described. however as i began to do more-i would feel somewhat like you describe-but with oxy not hydro. slurring, problems with coordination etc, and any opiate user should know about the morning after headache you can get when you indulge a lot. i was wondering-did you take the oxy that day as you had been and then the hydro?&nbsp; if so then as the other poster said you may have been bordering on od. it would have a cumulative effect.

				No I didn&#039;t take any oxycodone at all that day, or any opiate for that matter.<br /><br />I just can&#039;t believe how hard that 20mg hit me. I remember laying on the couch and thinking &quot;pretty soon I&#039;m not even going to be able to walk&quot;.<br /><br />Do you think it could have maybe been some sort of allergic reaction? I would say the experience as a whole was good, the only concerning thing for me was I was almost completely blind, seeing complete doubles of everything, had to close one eye to watch the TV, and I think I even started to develop cloudy thoughts and/or confusion.

				No benzos, no alcohol, I was pretty clean, only thing I can think is I took 50mg of tramadol about 2 hours prior, and about 300mg the day before (out of oxy for now), but I&#039;ve taken oxy with Tramadol many times and the oxy just seemed to overtake the tramadol without any bad effects, certainly not blurred or double vision.<br /><br />Just to make sure you know how bad it was, I had full on double vision, not simply a blurred vision but anything I looked at that was a few feet or more away, there were two images, not overlapping on top of each other. The best way I can describe it is, that feeling you get when your body tells you that you&#039;ve had way too much to drink, your head starts spinning, seeing double and develop nausea. It was almost like that, minus the head spinning and nausea, just couldn&#039;t focus my eyesight no matter how much I tried.

				that is very odd. i have never heard of hydrocodone affecting anyone that can handle oxy in that way.&nbsp; i have been in that state but it was after a full day of doing opiates-going thru the energetic state into the nodding out/shitfaced state. do you have any more of the pills-i was thinking you could check them out on the pill identifier to see if they were what was told to you. of course they could have been adulterated-but for now, i think i would stay away from hydro-or be super fucking careful with it. im glad you are ok!
