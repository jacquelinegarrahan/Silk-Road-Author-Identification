				Just in defense of myself.

				I&#039;m inclined to side with Rizzuto.&nbsp; I have noticed some strange activity concerning his SR feedback plus he canceled the order and lost half ounce of good cola?&nbsp; <br /><br />If that&#039;s the case then why leave him a 1/5? In my experience I was over joyed if I got my money back from a transaction that didn&#039;t go right. I think he deserved better than that because he did the right thing and canceled and you got your money back. A scammer would have offered a reship and drug it out a long time and maybe would have sent you a half ounce of bunk. It would have been harder for you to get your coin back if he had a track number showing delivery was right<br /><br />Plus for anyone who is wandering, there&#039;s more to ordering from a vendor than just to go by his feedback percentage. I have ordered from vendors with 100% for 2 years and still got the shank. Read the review threads for the most current reviews as well as the numbers and read what the vendor has been saying lately to make a better more accurate decision to order

You gave him one regarding a parcel yet delivered in the US insisting on him to FE.&nbsp; I guess that since you couldn&#039;t provide a correct TN, he asked for the refund. Why did you cancel? You could have gone to RC, provide TN case closed. My guess is it would have disclosed your scam in RC. <br /><br />As for the part where you state he didn&#039;t keep word, well, cynical, is what occurs to me. <br /><br />I also read you sent an ounce of junk and you&#039;ve got crap hard. This kind of vending will not get your rating back. <br />The guys posted here on the forums, it&#039;s not the competition, they rated what they got. 14g of rerock crap+ 14g of shit powder, as for the crack moist and tasting of baking soda. <br /><br />At Ralph:<br />Why do you side with Rizzuto, I don&#039;t understand? What are you referring to when you mention this strange feedback activity? I managed to link all the feedback to different posts, so far. <br />Why do you state he lost a good ounce of product? OP said he never got an accurate TN, to which Rizzuto cancelled the order. So I guess it was never sent. <br /><br />I reread your second paragraph a couple of times. Do you enjoy getting scammed?<br />Rizzuto cancelled an order that was never sent, or else he would have provided the accurate TN. He also already allegedly fucked someone sending exactly what you say, an ounce of bunk.<br />So sure, he got his money back, but as I suspect it was never sent, there is nothing to rejoice about. And as he got a wrong one before and was asked to FE, you must pretty much concede that it looked like a tentative scam to OP. I guess the &quot;he tried to fuck me&quot; feeling overweighs the &quot;at least I have the $&quot;, understandably. <br /><br />&quot;It would have been harder to get your coin back if he had a TN saying the delivery is right?&quot; What is that supposed to mean? He would also have his dope, hence no reason to complain. Unless he got bunk like the other guy. <br /><br />Your whole response feels like flawed or hasty logic to me. The introduction is dangerous to potential customers. <br />Why in the world based on the arguments you mention, would you side with Rizzuto? Sorry, but you fail to make any sense to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I was thinking the same as you Ralph123, but that was before R. Stated he cancelled. <br />Please comment, there are surely things I overlooked. <br /><br />Anyways I&#039;ll have close look on that one. <br /><br />Peace out<br />Jason<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				P.S:<br /><br />That when I gave Rizzuto 1/5 rating he was at 85-82 and now a week and a half later he is 75 or 72 but he went back up to 77 truth be said!

				Also, I never gave below 5/5 to any vendor except the ones who scammed or tried to scam in this case Rizzuto, gque, Doctordruglord 1/5. Other than that even for custom seized orders I still give 5/5 coz the vendor tried his best and shipped it also SR is a shared risk, escrow all the way though! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Pele, make sure to edit your post so to delete the name of the addressee, please. You might want to delete your SR buyer account name and the country where you reside, as well.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />- As I said above, it appears doubtful Rizzuto had cancelled the order if he sent it. This, and Rizzutos behavior are your arguments of why this is a scam, to you.<br />- you also disclose how you use your forum presence, acquaintances and your feedback, as leverage to obtain a desirable outcome. This might get you in the vendor blacklist.<br /><br />Thanks for the full disclosure.<br />Be sure to update if the package should show up, even though it seems unlikely.<br /><br />Peace out <br />Jason<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				it was to get my money back that all. I didnt mean anything else by that...Please let me know if you see another course of action or recommend what to do?<br /><br />I am more than happy to delete all the posts. I am not here to ruin a persons business, no not at all. I only wanted a refund for him to cancel the order and refund my money and just a warning for others. However, if you reckon that I went about it the wrong way please let me know and I will give it thought and see how I can remedy the situation.<br /><br />I am just glad that you can see or understand my point of view, I order 14g, he asked to FE i said after tracking, got tracking checked found fake tracking not mine, asked for a refund and for him to cancel order...which he finally did, having said that he saying that a package was sent then where is the track number he got? second, I can see your point in his defense that so far it is not 100% solid proof of him scamming but the thing is he didnt. He tried to scam!<br /><br />Now, if there was a package sent, which never happened, it should have arrived last week!!! Do you really think or believe anyone would ship 14g then refund the money, come on...<br /><br />Anyways, again please let me know your thoughts.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />Pele

Your goal was to get the cash back, you succeeded. You disclose everything, as you feel what and how you did it were the right things to do. Than, to achieve to oust him as a scammer, you would have needed to wait until RC. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184010.msg1362312#msg1362312">Quote from: Pele on July 21, 2013, 04:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am more than happy to delete all the posts.

You gave him one regarding a parcel yet delivered in the US insisting on him to FE.&nbsp; I guess that since you couldn&#039;t provide a correct TN, he asked for the refund. Why did you cancel? You could have gone to RC, provide TN case closed.
