				I bought coins last week at the right time.&nbsp; Their lowest.&nbsp; Then it doubled.&nbsp; I doubled my money and bought drugs with it all at its high.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doubled my drugs.<br /><br />Woollooooooooohhlookooooooo!!!!!!<br /><br />Now.&nbsp; I&#039;m buying Coins again with payday tomorrow at their lowest. Again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Guess what?&nbsp; By next week they will be up again and I&#039;ll buy drugs at their highest.&nbsp; Again. <br /><br />I know when it drops and rises. <br /><br />Watch the block chain. You can see when the players are out trading.&nbsp; &nbsp; Fuck.&nbsp; It&#039;s predicable.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it&#039;s going to happen again. Next week. It will be $240+. Again.

				I&#039;m going to have the reverse problem. <br /><br />I Keep reading on ways to secure oneself, how to make bootable usb, how to encrypt, etc etc etc. <br /><br />I feel so inadequately prepared, that I won&#039;t even be moving bitcoins here for awhile.

				I don&#039;t really play the Bitcoin game, usually as soon as i get my coins, I spend em on SR. I usually don&#039;t have coins for longer than 48hrs, so all of this has been really interesting to me.<br />I&#039;ve been lucky lately, purchasing coins right before they go up, earning myself a lil extra. And I bought coins an placed an order right before the big drop.<br />Once i get a little more money i think I&#039;m gonna throw a hundo or two into investing BTC an play around with that.<br /><br />Never thought I&#039;d become an investor haha

				preev was unreliable today for me - was quoting 100s while it was actually 60&#039;s. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be damned, I lost a live link that wasn&#039;t attached to MtGox, but it had a bid of 60s and an ask of 100&#039;s, which is one hell of a spread.
