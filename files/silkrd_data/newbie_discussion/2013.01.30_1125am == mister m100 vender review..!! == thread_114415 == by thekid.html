				just placed an order with him. his profile page didn&#039;t mention the est shipping time to my part of the world but went ahead my ordering anyway becos 1)no need to FE 2) gd reviews on packaging 3)prices are really good 4)shipping is free. PM&#039;ed him on some shipping qns, hope he&#039;ll reply soon. order status: &quot;processing&quot;. will update again. <br />10 days ago, placed an order with juergen but the order was canceled and btc refunded becos my mailing directions were unclear, then i had no access to comp for a week. by the time i realized this, he has already done the refund and what i had ordered was no longer listed. my loss.&nbsp; :( juergen&#039;s an honest seller with prompt and helpful communications.

				i&#039;ve read on rumor mill that some buyers have been waiting for a while for their orders to arrive but mine arrived in a week. perhaps he is running into back orders (i.e. out of stock) and didn&#039;t update his listed qty? i&#039;m not sure. there&#039;s a review on his product - that it is not good quality.<br /><br />link here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110889.msg833223#msg833223<br /><br />i can&#039;t say anything to this, yet, until i&#039;ve tested the product. will write another review on product. my review on the other aspects: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114378.60. my order was for 5g...<br /><br />
