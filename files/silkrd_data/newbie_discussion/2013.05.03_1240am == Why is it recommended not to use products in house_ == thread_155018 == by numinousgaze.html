				Everywhere I&#039;m reading that you should never use any purchased products at the house you had them delivered to. I understand this precaution for people ordering large amounts, but is it really necessary to take this measure if you&#039;re only ordering very small amounts for personal use?

After that, you&#039;re fine as long as you&#039;re not dealing. Think about it, if you bought a small amount and LE waited for more than a few days to visit, the likelihood for those oblivious to caution is the evidence would have been consumed, so if there is going to be a visit by LE, it would happen, in my belief, the day of delivery.<br /><br />peace

				It&#039;s just in case LE comes with a search warrant or for a controlled delivery. You wouldn&#039;t want to be caught with any illegal substances at your drop location.

				I think it&#039;s because if LE bust you taking your shit without them, they get upset and kick up a fuss. <br />
