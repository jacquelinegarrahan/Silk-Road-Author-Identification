				There is only one! <br />Or are there many against the one?<br />Or one against one?<br />Or no one against anyone?<br />Or everyone against everyone?<br />Pretty sure it&#039;s just the one, though. <br /><br /><br />And the package always comes eventually if you know what you&#039;re doing with it. <br />Unless he&#039;s on the phone with his mum, in which case the package will arrive immediately.

				I ordered from Oliver recently as well and the powder seems to be taking forever to show up. If you read his reviews a lot of people are talking about how it takes a long time to show up, but it still shows up. I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed and hoping this shit comes through. Also, why the fuck would you FE? Oliver doesn&#039;t even require you to.

				He shipped my order on 2/22 (supposedly) and haven&#039;t seen shit yet. I received items from Singapore and NL days ago.It&#039;s a shame to see a previously reliable vendor go to shit like this. But hey, maybe it&#039;s just taking awhile, although it&#039;s a hell of a long while. Unfortunately, it looks like I&#039;ll be hitting the resolution center on Friday. I can understand if a package is taking its time, but no communication whatsoever is what bothers me the most. I&#039;d be wary of his upcoming &quot;Sale&quot; he has advertised too.
