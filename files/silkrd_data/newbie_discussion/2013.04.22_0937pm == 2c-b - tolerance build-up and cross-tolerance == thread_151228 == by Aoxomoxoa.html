				Hey folks!<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering some stuff about 2cb tolerance. You could skip right down to the questions. <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here some background: <br />I&#039;ve bought this crazy amount of 2cb and been using it quite a lot lately. When I first got it in November last year I took it orally, about 20-30mg and then usually snorted ~10mg a couple of hours into the trip. That gave me crazy visuals and a nice feeling in my body. After some experimenting I believe that I get more body-high when taking it orally and more visuals when taken nasally. I started to only take it nasally since it was a lot more efficient. Only needed 15mg to get off, and 30mg would give me visuals out of this world. I really enjoy the visuals but I can&#039;t bare the burn it gives me when taken nasally, so I&#039;ve considered starting to only take it orally. I tried it this Friday. 43mg orally. I could definitely feel it in my body, got a nice rush and euphoria, but barely any visuals unless I really concentrated. I&#039;ve taken it almost once a week nasally, it&#039;s usually enough with 15mg to give me a decent trip. <br /><br />The weekend prior to the 43mg oral I had a real binge with my SO since she was leaving for India for some time. Took 23mg orally on Friday. Didn&#039;t feel much after an hour and fifteen minutes, bumped with 7mg nasally and got to a nice comfy cuddle-level. Then we took ~250mcg acid on Saturday and finished of with ~200mg MDMA a couple of hours after the LSD had faded. A week before that I had taken ~30mg 4ho-met. <br /><br />Bare with me. So after my 43mg experiment this Friday I felt a little disappointed. Expected some intense stuff. Went out clubbing the day after and got home drunk. Because of my disappointment and being drunk I decided to snort 15mg (or so I think, not sure due to drunkenness). It got really blurry and twirling. Started vomiting like crazy, got confused and wandered around my apartment naked until there were no more vomiting to be done. Passed out a little bit later on my bed. I&#039;ve combined alcohol and 2cb successfully earlier (New Years Eve), but I was probably just way to drunk this time. I believe that was the first time ever I&#039;ve felt asleep while tripping. <br /><br />Anyway, on Thursday I&#039;m going out to some friends tripping again. I don&#039;t know what I should take. This time is a little special since we are introducing my SO&#039;s brother to psychedelics. So I want to get to a good trippsitting level. Get into the zone to talk trippy stuff, but still being able to take care of him. Can I take a regular dose of tryptamines or should I increase because of my (suspected) 2cb tolerance? Mushrooms or 4ho-met. I&#039;m not sure if I have built up a really strong tolerance to 2cb or if I&#039;m just so much more sensitive taking it nasally. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s supposedly 3x more sensitive nasally than orally. But this 43mg felt more like 5mg nasally. Anyone else have this problem with taking 2cb orally, that it&#039;s underwhelming?<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Questions:<br />Is there a cross-tolerance between 2cb and tryptamines (shrooms or 4ho-met)?<br />If you take 2cb regularly (one week apart for several weeks in a row) can you build a tolerance that takes longer than a week to wear off?<br />Can one be a lot more sensitive to 2cb nasally than orally, say 5-6x more sensitive compared to the more commonly reported 3x more sensitive?<br /><br />This is frustrating because I feel like it&#039;s wasting taking 3x more orally and not getting at all as much out of it compared to nasally.
