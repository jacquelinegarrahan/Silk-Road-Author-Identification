				&nbsp;On whether the government could ban Tor or Bitcoin, the tools Silk Road uses to provide anonymity: <br />[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />&nbsp;[/font]“The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no?&nbsp; Personally, I don’t think they can be effectively banned at this point.&nbsp; Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing.” <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=16070.msg482240#msg482240)[/font]<br />On the decision to create the Armory, a Silk-Road-like site for selling weapons, in February of 2012:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“We at Silk Road have no moral objection to the sale of small-arm weaponry. We believe that an individual’s ability to defend themselves is a cornerstone of a civil society. Without this, those with weapons with eventually walk all over defenseless individuals. It could be criminals who prey on others, knowing they are helpless. It could be police brutalizing people with no fear of immediate reprisal. And as was seen too many times in the last century, it could be an organized government body committing genocide on an entire unarmed populace. Without the ability to defend them, the rest of your human rights will be eroded and stripped away as well.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />That being said, there is no reason we have to force everyone into a one-size-fits-all market where one group has to compromise their beliefs for the benefit of another. That’s the kind of narrow thinking currently used by governments around the world. It’s why we are in this mess in the first place. The majority in many countries feel that drugs and guns should be illegal or heavily regulated, so the minority suffers.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />Here at Silk Road, we recognize the smallest minority of all, YOU! Every person is unique, and their human rights are more important than any lofty goal, any mission, or any program. An individual’s rights ARE the goal, ARE the mission, ARE the program. If the majority wants to ban the sale of guns on Silk Road, there is no way we are going to turn our backs on the minority who needs weaponry for self defense.” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=13256.msg126982#msg126982)[/font]<br />On closing “the Armory” six months later:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“As most of you have figured out, we are closing the Armory. Your first question is probably “why?” Well, it just wasn’t getting used enough. Spinning it off originally was done somewhat abruptly and while we supported it, it was a kind of “sink or swim” experiment. The volume hasn’t even been enough to cover server costs and is actually waning at this point. I had high hopes for it, but if we are going to serve an anonymous weapons market, I think it will require more careful thought and planning.”[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />On DPR’s excitement at Silk Road’s success:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“You’ll have to wait for my memoirs for the juicy details, lol. I’ve got some stories though, I’ll tell ya. One weird thing that goes through my head when Silk Road goes through a growth spurt, like after the first Gawker article (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgawker.com%2F5805928%2F&amp;ei=xXN-UZv9Gs6F0QHHvYDICQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG90rYabmAsEVtfftTP5Jj7Xk-jDw&amp;sig2=hCpbNfWRDkmIxmL4y_cUig&amp;bvm=bv.45645796,d.dmQ) is that sound effect from Inception, or the intense music from the new Tron movie. It gives me the sensation of ‘holy shit, this is EPIC!’” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=25572.msg384851#msg384851)[/font]<br />On the users’ power to control Silk Road:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“The way I see it, we are all players in something that has grown way beyond any one of us. Granted I play a unique role, but part of that role is continually earning the trust of the community to make the right choices going forward, and to serve each of you as best I can. Silk Road was built to serve you, your needs and desires are the wind that fills its sails. Without you, we are dead in the water. So sure, it’s my job to steer and chart the course, and I am ultimately responsible for the outcome of this experiment, but never forget where the real power lies. It’s where it always has been, in your hands.” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=33227.msg380629#msg380629)[/font]<br />On starting the Dread Pirate Roberts Book Club, an online book club devoted to Austrian economics and libertarianism:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors. Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward. Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs? We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to.”[/font]<br /><br /><br />###<br /><br /><br />End Part V, cont&#039;d Part VI<br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=46460.msg499753#msg499753)[/font]<br />&nbsp;
