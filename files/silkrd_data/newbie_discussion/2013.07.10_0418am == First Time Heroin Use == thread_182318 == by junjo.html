				I&#039;ve been a user of many drugs over the years, largely psychedelics, but I&#039;ve always been interested in trying heroin just once, mostly due to the grand reputation the drug has had.<br />I don&#039;t need or want a lesson on how heroin can ruin your life, I&#039;m well aware of that.<br />I want the knowledge to help me avoid such a disaster<br />Say if I buy a stamp from one of the top sellers, say Deluxedelivery what should I expect?<br />My main questions are:<br />1)How large is a &quot;stamp&quot; (in mg)<br />2)If I&#039;m planning on insufflation, how many milligrams should I take? (I have next to no opiate tolerance)<br />3)What negative effects do I need to prepare for during and after I take the dose?<br />4)Will I legitimately have a high chance of being hooked just from one experiment?<br />And also feel free to contribute anything else you feel I should know.<br />Thanks in advance for helping a newbie out!

				Advice from someone who has lost multiple people to heroin: Don&#039;t. I have NEVER seen heroin be a positive in someone&#039;s life, ever. And I&#039;ve seen quite a few people who use it.

				0. DeluxeDelivery = Good stuff.<br />1. A stamp should be .1g or 100mg. In reality it ranges anywhere from .05 to .1. especially on the street.<br />2. With DD, start with 5 mg and work your way up. 15 mg can and will fuck you up. With street shit, it widely varies. Sometimes 15 (yeah, right...) sometimes 150.<br />3. Being cocky, doing too much and puking your guts out. Also, questioning &quot;Why am I not high every single hour?&quot;<br />4. No. Sorry, I fully reject this hypothesis. I&#039;ve used opiates, aside from the first time I had IV dilaudid and vicodin (DURING HOSPITALIZATION) maybe 20 times in the last 8 years. And I was hospitalized for 2 weeks, at 3 mg/ hr dillies... on the needle... so if ANYONE should have been addicted it should have been me. Dilaudid is WAY better than H, in fact I think Opana and Oxy are as well. <br />Additional notes: Don&#039;t. I have NEVER seen heroin be a positive in someone&#039;s life, ever.

				Can&#039;t recommend DeluxeDelivery enough. Expect 0.05 - 0.1 g. Unless you do something stupid like shoot a stamp you&#039;ll be fine. I&#039;d say divide a stamp into 2 lines have one and see how you feel. And unless you order a heap more right away you most defiantly won&#039;t become addicted.

				Have you ever done Oxy IR&#039;s???&nbsp; H isn&#039;t much different than them, or any other opiate for that mAttere. If you&#039;;ve never got a good oxy high, mayube you should just do that . As far as bad side effects from the H, you might puke . It&#039;s kinda common for 1st timers . Usually it&#039;s just 1 puke, then your done and feeling high high high&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)
