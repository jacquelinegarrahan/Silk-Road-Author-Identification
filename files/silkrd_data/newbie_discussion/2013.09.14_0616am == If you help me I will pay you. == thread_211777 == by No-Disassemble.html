				Well, No-Disassemble, I did the exact same thing (see my recent comment under the cryptokeeper &#039;discuss&#039; link). Yes, you should act before crypto logs-on. Unfortunately, moneyhoney has taken-down her listing for the time being.<br /><br />I had success by using Delmat813. I would suggest that you message him first, to see if he will do it. His listing, called &quot;BTC HARD TO FIND? GET THEM HERE NOW!!!&quot;&nbsp; is at this url:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/63e0d49819<br /><br />Good luck. Tell him that JeanRob sent you. <br /><br />JeanRob

				P.S., No-Disassemble, please let us know how you end-up converting your 2 Vanilla reload cards. I would imagine that lots of folks would like to know.<br /><br />JeanRob

				If you haven&#039;t solved this problem already I would be willing to help.<br />This is not my usual kind of transaction on SR but am experienced with dealing with prepaid cards and the headaches associated.<br />Also I won&#039;t steal your money. Normally I&#039;d refer you to vicious86, who is 110% reliable and honest, but he is closed for the weekend.

The friendliest, most responsive exchange vendor since JumboMonkeyBiscuit was here.

I dont think he should be trusted but thats just me. If you wanna use someone like that and it works for you, go for it. I like dealing with people with alot less drama going on.

				Glad things worked out for you, No-Disassemble.<br /><br />I also was not scammed by cryptokeeper. I had two Vanilla reload cards, and I initially signed up for his listing. With over 300 transactions, and all 5 out of 5 feedback, I figured that I couldn&#039;t lose. Then I read the comments in his &#039;discuss&#039; comments and I panicked. I wrote crypto and asked him to cancel the order. Then I found someone else to exchange the two Vanilla cards. Later, (two days later) crypto cancelled my order. But then I noticed the he had not read the message I had sent asking him to cancel the order.<br /><br />I got the heebie-geebies about crypto for the same reason mentioned by No-Disassemble---because he had some hired help who he apparently claimed had ripped-off some of his customers. All I know is that it took two days during the week for crypto to check his listing, then he cancelled my order with no communication.
