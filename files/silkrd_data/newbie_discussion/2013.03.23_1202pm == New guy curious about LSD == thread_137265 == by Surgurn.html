				I&#039;ve been lurking the market for some time now; mostly browsing and wishfully thinking. Dunno how I just noticed there&#039;s a forum, but I figured this would be the best place to ask- Which seller in your opinion has the best product? I read the reviews every day almost, and with the huge amount of positive reviews revolving around them, it&#039;s hard to figure out which one to go with. All I can find in my town is 25i and other 2C families, and while they&#039;re fun, I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re fucking my brain up.<br /><br /><br />I also noticed the dosage was dramatically different comparing the LSD with the 25i. (The 25i dosing into the 1000+ micrograms versus the LSD&#039;s 100-300ug dosage) Can anyone tell me why this is? And for a guy who normally drops 2-3 tabs of 25i at a time, what would be a good dose of LSD to start with?<br /><br />Hope this is the right section, because I&#039;m pretty fucking new.

				I would recommend Tessellated. Jesus of Rave has vials of what is apparently some of the best LSD in Europe if not the world, but you&#039;d have to buy a bit more, so probably not worth it if you&#039;ve never tried acid.<br /><br />I have only made 5 purchases on the road, 2 have been from Tess. Incredibly fast shipping both times, great comms, does not require FE, and the stealth is amazing. Really amazing. He/she is very open to new buyers and never asks for FE. Good prices (relative to other vendors), great product. The dosage of these tabs is not advertised since lab results have not come back yet. They were originally listed at 200ug, and many of the reviews attest to this dosage.<br /><br />That said, before making any purchase I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth doing your own research, don&#039;t just take my word for it, check out Tess&#039; review thread. There&#039;s also a group called the Avengers who work to provide everyone with reliable information about LSD vendors, I&#039;d check out their thread too (at least the first page).<br /><br />As for dosage... LSD is several times more potent than 25i, hence the lower dose. And they are really not the same drug. I&#039;d recommend taking 100-200ug for the first dose. You will not be disappointed with a 200ug dose, I&#039;m sure. And if you are, then you&#039;ll know for next time.<br /><br />Good luck on SR. Just a few weeks ago I was in your position. Have ordered 4 times with absolutely no hiccups. These forums are essential if you do not want to get scammed IMO, so read read read the reviews of a vendor before buying from them. If there aren&#039;t any reviews, be very careful. Hope this helps.

				LSD avengers thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Top post is regularly updated, very experienced reviews and accurate strengths.<br /><br />If you&#039;re used to 2-3 hits on NBOMe (tripping balls pretty hard) I would say you will need 200ug for the same visuals, however your head is going to in a very different place, start with half of that and re dose if necessary.

				I am also intrested in LSD, especially in comparison to NBOMe.<br /><br />I have bought LSD from three different vendors on SR, all &quot;old&quot; members with very good FB etc., but never really noticed any effect, so I think it&#039;s not the product but me that&#039;s the &quot;problem&quot;.<br /><br />Just recently I bought some NBOMe, and that really *had* an effect, wow, not altogether &quot;pleasant&quot; but certainly very interesting (I&#039;d suggest to be very careful, and not take it when you are in a bad mood, depressed, etc., but that&#039;s probably true with most drugs)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t get any intense visuals (some distortions, yes, but I could walk and talk quite naturally, but I also didn&#039;t take very much, at least not for very long, only had the blotter (about 1000 micro-g?) under my tongue for 15 minutes or so), but a lot of &quot;insights&quot; and recovered memories and things like that.

They&#039;ll just relax you and/or make you pass the fuck out which at the end of a trip is sometimes all you really want. A bad trip can be anything from you not wanting to be THAT high anymore, you feeling anxious about the high or the environment that you&#039;re in to a full blown mental breakdown because you&#039;re so fucked up and you&#039;re brain can&#039;t handle what you&#039;re feeling. I&#039;ve only experienced the first too and I&#039;ve witnessed the third and it was pretty damn scary. Acid is a much longer trip than any other psychedelic I&#039;ve ever done and for me that was really the only overwhelming part, but alas it affects everyone differently. I hope you get your hands on a good batch and have a wonderful experience with IMO one of the the best drugs there is&nbsp; ;)

I think I want to trip so hard I completely disconnect with reality.
