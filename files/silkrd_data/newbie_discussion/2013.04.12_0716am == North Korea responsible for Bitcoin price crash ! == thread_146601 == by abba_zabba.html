				I think an organized attempt to destabilize BTC is probably a more likely culprit than that. <br /><br />Another possibility is that certain investment groups are now buying them up for speculation purposes, and when you own a sizable amount, it seems like it would be easy to sell off, trigger a downward spiral and then reinvest at the lower price, especially with all the press and media about the currency&#039;s growth, and the organized mtgox DDOSs.

				North Korea has the kind of internet they have at McDonald&#039;s children&#039;s kiosks that don&#039;t let you anywhere but McDonald&#039;s.com and some game where you have to anally rape the Hamburglar for his crimes against humanity.

				Yeah their internet is pretty much a joke, but very few citizens even have internet access, much less have any idea of what the internet even is. <br /><br />Kim Jong-Un was educated in Switzerland though, so while many of the citizens of North Korea might be ignorant, and fooled by their countries propaganda, the people at the top (including their leader) are well aware of the realities of the world. <br /><br />Its pretty insane to think about how disconnected their common people are. Its hard to wrap ones head around, especially having been born and educated in the west.
