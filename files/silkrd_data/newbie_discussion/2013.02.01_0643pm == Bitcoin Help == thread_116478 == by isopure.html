				Ok first let me state for the record I am an idiot so no reason for anyone to point that out to me.<br /><br />My question is: after I deposit money w/zipzap and funds are in Mtgox how do I get them into my sr wallet?<br /><br />Thank you to anyone who helps.

				When you are logged into SR, if you click on &quot;account&quot; it will show your SR wallet address.&nbsp; Copy that, and then goto your MtGox and go to withdraw, enter the amount of BTC you want to withdraw, copy your SR wallet address into the area...<br /><br />That should take care of it for you<br />-AA<br /><br />PS: if it doesn&#039;t, post and I will go log in to mine and make sure I am not forgetting something

				FYI I&#039;m a vendor here and have been for 6 months but, unfortunately got trapped by the 50 post rule. (Not much time to spend on here.)<br /><br />Anyway... The other thing you should be aware of is that it can take quite some time for your bitcoins to show up. Or not. :) It depends on how busy the SR servers are. <br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is, always put a few more coins in your SR wallet than you think you&#039;ll need. Shipping fees vary, and prices can too when bitcoin is volatile. I don&#039;t know how many PMs I get every week asking for some sort of special arrangement because the buyer did put quite enough coins in their wallet to cover their planned purchase. Vendors, especially the good ones, are VERY busy people and it takes quite a bit of time to put up a new and special listing just for you. Nobody&#039;s fault. Tor is slow. So don&#039;t go there unless you just gotta. :P<br /><br />

				true....if you use zipzap at a walmart with cash and all fake info though...the ability to link ya would be REALLY difficult<br /><br />somebody would have to REALLY want you, and if they wanted you THAT&nbsp; bad you could tumble your life and they would find ya.

				All points are valid in my case.&nbsp; SR has not entered the bitcoins in my wallet for over 40 hours.&nbsp; Customer service has not responded either.&nbsp; Walmart-Bitinstant worked fine. Easy to maintain anonymity.&nbsp; However, the delay in processing emphasizes the need to have a few extra coins in the wallet.
