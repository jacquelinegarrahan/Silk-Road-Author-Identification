				I have been watching&nbsp; bitcoin bidding on ebay and have seen winning&nbsp; bids as high as 1000 for a single bitcoin. Are these highjacked accounts just trying to fluctuate the market ? Why would some one pay 5 to ten times the value?

				The only possible benefit I have noticed from this is that you can get your bitcoins delivered to you much quicker than other sites that offer the service. But really I don&#039;t see how that makes it worth the absurdly high prices. I think the people selling bitcoins on ebay are just banking on the ignorance of people who aren&#039;t very familiar with bitcoins.

				Funk yeah, I noticed this the other day also.&nbsp; It is a quick way to exchange your paypal if you can&#039;t withdraw from it into bitcoin instantly in order to further make more credits if you know what i mean.&nbsp; it&#039;s also a great way to profit off the bitcoins alone because there are a lot of people that just don&#039;t know, don&#039;t want the hastle of going to a cash spot.&nbsp; I personally got a few cents just to test out if it&#039;s legit and to switch that shitty paypal service credit into something i can use instantly rather than getting verified and all that garbage.&nbsp; There&#039;s money in it too, there are over 1,000 listings and the sellers are selling at an astonishingly fast rate.&nbsp; Better jump on that band wagon before Paypal or Ebay get&#039;s pissed and stops it all.&nbsp;
