				I remember the first time I bought BTC, I transferred them from my BTC wallet to an Instawallet.&nbsp; The fucking things disappeared for two days.&nbsp; Tried emailing the Instawallet people and got nothing.&nbsp; Eventually, they did show up in the Instawallet and I got an email back apologizing and explaining there had been some weird hiccup with the site.<br /><br />During those two days, I had just about convinced myself what an idiot I was for thinking this whole Silk Road thing would even work, that I should have known it was too good to be true.&nbsp; Now I don&#039;t even fuck with third party e-wallets.&nbsp; SR&#039;s tumbler is going to launder the BTC just as well as transferring it between other wallets will and you don&#039;t have to worry about leaving tracks on the clearnet.<br /><br />
