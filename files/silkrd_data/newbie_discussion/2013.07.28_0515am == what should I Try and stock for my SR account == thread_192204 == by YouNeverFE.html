				The one thing most people find cheaper on the streets is cocaine.&nbsp; If you can get decent stuff and undercut the big names you will take off.&nbsp; Some things that come to mind with higher demand than supply are mescaline, 6-apb, and MXE.&nbsp; But for best results, find something you can undercut people on, your advantage is what you can get cheap where you live.

				If it was possible, no one sells crystal, and few people sell liquid LSD. I know it&#039;s hard to come by, but it&#039;s not currently on the market.

If you could source it and sell it at a reasonable price, the market would be instantly yours. It would have to be of a good quality, naturally. You would also have to develop safe packaging techniques to accommodate for the large amounts, since GHB is typically dosed at 2-3 grams at a time. Orders of 50g and up would be common. This drug doesn&#039;t get the credit it deserves, and its a shame there aren&#039;t any vendors selling it in the US. <br /><br />Just a suggestion!
