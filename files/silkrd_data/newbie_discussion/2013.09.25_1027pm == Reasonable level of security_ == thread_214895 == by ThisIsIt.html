				I&#039;m trying to figure out a reasonable level of security for using SR. <br /><br />Many people suggest going to (what I consider) great lengths to anonymize oneself. Like this reddit post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c8yb3/a_stepbystep_guide_to_creating_an_anonymous/<br /><br />What I want to know is, roughly, the distribution of SR users being very / moderately / or not cautious about anonymity. <br /><br />For example, let&#039;s say I purchased Bitcoins through a popular exchange using my bank account. (So my name is tied to the coins), but I transfer them to a &quot;brain wallet&quot; set up offline via bitaddress.org, then use Electrum to transfer the coins from this wallet to my SR wallet using BitcoinFog. All of these activities are done using my personal computer (mac) on a university internet connection. All with the intent on purchasing $100 to $200 of illicit goods.<br /><br />How safe is this? Is it stupidly naive? I understand it&#039;s all a bit of a gamble, but I&#039;m just trying to figure out a idea effort vs. risk ratio. Would this amount of &quot;security&quot; allow me any plausable deniability? Maybe LE would know I used SR, but not what I purchased?<br /><br />Thanks.

				As long as you&#039;re not using onion.to to get here, I&#039;d say you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />You&#039;re using tails or TBB, right?&nbsp; <br /><br />As long as your coin is run through bitcoinfog.&nbsp; But switch up addresses in there and next time use more than 1 address perhaps etc.

				I am sort of asking the same question in my post but I am concerned more about your home IP address rather than bitcoin.<br /><br />the reddit link states:<br /><br />DO NOT CONNECT TO THE NETWORK FROM YOUR HOME.<br /><br />I repeat, for an extra layer of security, DO NOT CONNECT TO YOUR HOME WIFI USING TAILS IF YOU WANT TO DO SHADY THINGS. That&#039;s just common sense. TAILS itself isn&#039;t illegal. But if you&#039;re the type to do shady things, you don&#039;t want to practice on your home Wifi, <br /><br />But why would you need to download tails from an open wifi connection as long as you didn&#039;t use it from your home connection.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yes, I&#039;m using Tor Browser Bundle. <br /><br />I would create a new address for each transfer from the Bitcoin exchange to bitcoinfog. <br /><br />When you say &quot;next time use more than 1 address perhaps&quot; do you mean: Bitcoin exchange &gt; (address 1) &gt; bitcoinfog &gt; (address 2) &gt; Silk Road? or do you mean something else?<br /><br />Thanks for your response. Some people make it seem like an absolute necessity to purchase bitcoins with cash, using a clean linux machine with tails, have VPN, and other things (which I&#039;m sure add extra protection).
