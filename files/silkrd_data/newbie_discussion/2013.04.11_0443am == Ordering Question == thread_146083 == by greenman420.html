				What&#039;s up everyone? this is my first post and as we speak i&#039;m waiting for my bitcoins to be deposited so I can make my first order.&nbsp; While that&#039;s being done, i was hoping i could get some other things cleared up:<br /><br />1. PGP - i don&#039;t know much about it. do i have to learn it ASAP and use it to encrypt the address for delivery?<br />2. the order - do i use a fake name other than my own?<br />3. Any other advice?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know these may be stupid or newbie questions but, this is the newbie discussion thread.&nbsp; I&#039;d appreciate it if someone could get back to me soon because i&#039;m really eager to put in an order.&nbsp; Thanks for the help guys and i&#039;m happy to be part of the community.

				Dude slow your roll a bit b/c you really need to do a lot more than just use PGP. Start at the security forum and there is a link called the beginners guide to using SR anonymously. Get your system protected and learn how to do this right before you go placing orders just because you are too excited to wait. I mean you could be looking at serious jail time if you don&#039;t go about this properly. Goodness. Read all you can and protect yourself. Don&#039;t finalize before you have received your order and made sure it&#039;s what you ordered. Read the Rumor Mill section to find out about good vendors and who to trust. Think before you act and when you do act do it intelligently.

				Welcome!<br /><br />1. YES. PGP will save your life. Plus, cryptography is cool. Learn it! There is a newbie PGP club thread stickied at the top of this subforum. <br /><br />2. DO NOT use a fake name. That is just one more thing that could go wrong. While it COULD work, if shit goes wrong just because you used a fake name, it would suck. It does NOT give you any additional protection, you already have plausible deniability from ordering to your house. THEY have to prove you deliberately ordered it. Using a fake name gives them ammo to use against you. <br /><br />3. NEVER FE. Unless you like gambling with your money, this is a bad idea! <br />3.1 Do LOTS of research on the forums before picking a vendor. This can save you from getting bunk product or scammed.<br />3.2 If you are in doubt, ask a question! Someone on here probably knows the answer. <br />3.3 NEVER FE. Emphasis on that. <br />3.4 If shit hits the fan (lets hope it does not), do NOT say anything to the cops. They will screw you over as much as possible. Superglue your lips shut if necessary, this will save your life. I had a situation where if I had just kept my mouth shut I probably could have saved several thousand dollars, gotten a job, and not had to spend the better part of a year without any weed at all (that was the worst part).<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to pop me a message!

				Exactly what has been said before me.<br /><br />I know you&#039;re excited, OP. We all are, no matter how long we&#039;ve been here. But dude...read first. YES, use PGP. It helps protect you from LE and going to prison.<br />Use your real name. Your bills always make it to your house don&#039;t they? (And so will your package) And anyone can send anything can&#039;t they? Never talk to the cops. Do NOT finalize early before you get your product. And lawyers are your best friends if your vendor fucks up or you didn&#039;t do your research on who you order from and cops come knocking.<br /><br />PLEASE, please, please read up some more. The package isn&#039;t going out tonight anyway.

				I appreciate all the help guys.&nbsp; I&#039;m installing the software now and going to figure that all out and continue reading up on everything I can find on the forums.&nbsp; And I know what item I want to order, what is the best way to find out info about the seller should I post on here or is there a thread?&nbsp; I guess I could always try searching the username on the forums but i&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s an easier way<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; nevermind that was stupid, found the RumorMill

				The above posters have it nailed perfectly. There really should be some sort of FAQ and test you are required to complete in order to make your first purchase :(. <br /><br />Adding a bit to what has been said, PGP is an amazing tool for every day emails and such as well. Most every email service scans the content of the email, so there is a permanent record of every email you send. Using PGP no one has any idea what you are saying, and its best that way. To many times people get caught for stupid shit because they think email is like a letter. The US govt at the moment has carte blanche access to nearly any email they want. Say fuck the system and use PGP in every day life :D.<br /><br />Also I could of swore the beginners guide anonypunk mentioned had been stickied, but I guess not. So I was nice and found the threads for you!<br />GPG (Windows PGP) step-by-step guide: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br />How to Anonymously Use Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br />Some of the guide goes a bit overboard, but this is your security so take whatever levels you feel are necessary to hedge your risk. 5 minutes of hassle can save you a lifetime in jail :)<br /><br />Also the forums are your best friend when researching vendors. We have a fairly good section called the Rumor mill that has most vendors on the road and what people think about them. Use the search feature and save yourself a lot of trouble. Also like everyone has already said NEVER EVER FE. No reason to. <br /><br />Hope that helps mate!

				Good on you for getting this far. Like the others said, a little bit more reading will save you lots of hassle and worry. I&#039;m not too long on the road myself, and I found the following threads particularly helpful. Forgive me if you&#039;ve already found them.<br /><br /><br />Silk Road Wiki<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />SR NEW MEMBER PLS READ - FW: SR FAQ Compilation by Delta11<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Official [Insert Drug Here] Vendor Topics (Now all linked on wiki&#039;s main page)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42088.0<br /><br />Good Luck!
