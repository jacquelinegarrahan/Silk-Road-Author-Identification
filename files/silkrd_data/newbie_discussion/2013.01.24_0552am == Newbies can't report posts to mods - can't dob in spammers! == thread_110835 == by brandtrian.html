				Exactly. I mean I understand there were some troubles with people creating accounts and then causing havoc, but people should&#039;ve been grandfathered in. I mean look at my karma points. Shouldn&#039;t that have counted for something. <br /><br />Now we just end up with people making 50 posts of nonsense. It&#039;s like back in school when you had to write a 5 page paper, regardless of how much you had to say on the topic.

Posts are gone. Guess I didn&#039;t have to report it after all, but if we can report them it means you guys don&#039;t have to waste time catching them.. admins and mods are a rare enough breed that I like to make things easier for them :)<br />Appreciate your work in keeping the forum clean.. although they must be very patient to sit there and hand-fill the captcha&#039;s. Hopefully your vigilance deters them!!<br />Still reckon it&#039;s worth considering allowing reporting for newbs though.<br /><br />Thanks for the reply mate!

				50 posts is a lot. i can only access SR at night without having a real slow connection. I&#039;ve been on the forums a few times, but i don&#039;t wanna live here... i can&#039;t post in threads i want to in other forums, so whatever i&#039;ll post random msgs until 50 posts.<br /><br />think of it this way, the noobs who want to be active on SR forums will be spamming a while.
