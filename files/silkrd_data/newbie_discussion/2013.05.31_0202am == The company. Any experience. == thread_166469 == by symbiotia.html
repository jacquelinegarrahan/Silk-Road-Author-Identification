				TheCompany was fair with my 1st purchase, quality and weight were exactly as advertised.&nbsp; And the communication/shipping/stealth were great as well.&nbsp; Oh, and best of all, no FE!

				The tar I bought from them (6 months ago) was quality. Upper-mid-tier price with upper-tier quality. The package only took 3 days to arrive to the West Coast of USA. Overall, I was happy with my purchase.

				BTW, I purchased 1g of the A1 Whip crack, it was smooth, delicious bell ringers. The crack arrived in 2 nice sized rocks, Not wet or crushed like some SR and street vendors product. The price is worth the quality and security of no FE and the escrow system.

				I have an order pending at the moment with them. I am in one of those countries that most vendors request FE. I did in good faith and honestly, I could get scammed 3 times and get the fourth and it would still be cheaper than street price here. <br />Anyway, We are liaising at the moment to come to a resolution. I am not as worried about this whole thing now. Communication is concise, albeit somewhat delayed.<br />I understand the workload I imagine they are under, I will update as this progresses.<br />

				my order from the company was not the best experience.&nbsp; they put the drugs inside a regular envelope, no padding or anything and then put that inside a priority envelope - you could tell there was almost nothing in the priority envelope, you could even feel a small buldge where the drugs were.&nbsp; when I contacted the company about that they said &quot;it wasn&#039;t supposed to ship like that, it was the shipping department&#039;s fault&quot;

Personally, smaller groups with a single place of operation feel the most reliable with the most care for your and their safety. Anyone got a quality report on his bud cause that price is anything but competitive, but i am looking for some real fire from a domestic vendor.

				I ordered 3.5g of meth, It has been about five weeks since the order and I FE&#039;d.<br />I had sent 3 PMs to them starting about 3 weeks ago. I only got a response a couple of days ago, after the last message I sent which was worded rather bluntly. I responded almost immediately, three days ago and I am currently still awaiting the reply.<br />That&#039;s the story so far.<br />Tune in next time for Trying to import drugs to Australia!<br />Same bat time same bat channel. :)

				The communication doesn&#039;t&nbsp; seem fair I agree,&nbsp; but on the other hand I only see one side of this story.&nbsp; I cannot count the times that I have read about members/vendors and shipping problems in/out of Australia. The forums and the wiki are loaded with so much information, you should take advantage of these resources.

				I have been a member for about 7 weeks. The amount of reading I have been doing is starting to get ridiculous really.<br />I am still learning, but as I stated earlier, with the price differences I would have to lose a lot of items to come out behind financially.<br />I see it as a standard learning curve. I mean, this isn&#039;t exactly ebay. Even if it seems like it.<br />I don&#039;t think there would be many people who have bought questionable products from the street and have never been ripped off somehow. Whether it be cut shit, underweight, overpriced because &quot;It&#039;s hard to get at the moment&quot;<br />Thankfully people who engage in such actions do not last.<br />It will pan out, just gotta learn your three Rs :)

				TheCompany is the greatest person ALIVE in this modern world today.<br /><br />I have used him so many times over the past 18 months, that I have lost count. Best meth I have ever had was with TheCompany.<br /><br />I always come back to him after trying other vendors, want to know why? He always gets me the killer and does not fuck around.<br /><br />&amp; Fuk you for mentioning packaging. Delete the post. Why try and hide shit for with &#039;stealth&#039;? Just makes customs curious cunts where they will open your mail. The main aim is to not open the mail at all and TheCompany knows his shit. Right? Good.<br /><br />Bye<br /><br />ABC<br /><br />

				You wouldn&#039;t believe it! I went back and updated my feedback from this transaction.<br /><br />A few hours later I got a message from TC. Suggesting we try a reship to a different address, I responded that I would be willing if he had made successful shipments to AUS. <br />He assured me that he had plenty of experience with this. So I sent him an encrypted address to try.<br /><br />I then went and updated my feedback. <br /><br />Stay tunedn for the gripping finale!<br />

				@ Whistleblowers, aye.<br />I since messaged them asking if the order had been shipped.<br />I received a reply asking what the weight of the original order was. I responded.<br />I started to think; Is this a ploy to get their feedback looking good while they have product?<br /><br />Just dick my around until they are empty again, then wait until restock.
