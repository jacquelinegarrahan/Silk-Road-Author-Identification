				Just curious as to what constitutes good stealth? I have seen some people mention that newbies will give praise on a shipper stealth, when what sometimes happens is that it is a miracle the package got to them at all. So what is good stealth? <br /><br />Obviously not looking for specifics, but is it just that an envelop or package looks like something you might get from Ebay? No odor until you cut open the inside package yourself. Hiding pills with other pills?<br /><br />Thanks for the thoughts all.

				What is good stealth? A flat black radar absorbing painted gps guided UAV with drug payload that delivers to a 10 digit grid in the dead of night. <br /><br />Just kidding. But seriously that is such an open ended question. If it is something stinky, a MBB is essential in my opinion. And depending on the product there are so many potential answers. I doubt anyone will give away trade secrets on here as they shouldnt. There are some pretty clever packagers here though. My suggestion is pick a vendor or 2 with great &quot;stealth packaging&quot; feedback and try them out.

				Moisture barrier bag. Different mbb&#039;s have different MVTR ratings. MVTR is moisture vapor transmission rate. For example the best of the best, 3M 3700 series MBB&#039;s Have a MVTR of .0003. Meaning if a square meter of the material was in a 100% relative humidity environment .0003 grams of water would pass through the material in 24 hours. Double bag at this rate and you are at nearly zero. <br /><br /><br />Dont feel bad, if you dont ask you dont know!

				I&#039;ve worked for the USPS and I&#039;ve made a few orders on here and seen both good and bad stealth. Honestly, fot a small order of like an 8 ball of coke, a double sealed pack in a padded priority enveloped us more than enough, but the same hidden in a small consumber product like a iphone cover or small kid&#039;s toy is even better. Bad stealth is none vacuumed drugs simply taped flat in a first class envelope. When I was a postal worker, I pulled thousand of dollars in pain pills out of the machineand pocketed them because its that obvious.(Especially when I saw a college town address on it.)

				When customs open&#039;s it up and still can&#039;t find anything on a random inspection. : )<br /><br />Good stealth is when you have it, and it takes you 5mins to find it. : )<br /><br />Good stealth is when someone has already opened it, and threw it in the bin, not seeing the contents. <br /><br />Had that happen once.

				To me the best are the best stealth is the stuff that is vacuum packed and then put inside another product, which is then resealed.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen it a couple times and I&#039;m always impressed with it.<br /><br />
