				I have one thread about Ptsd here already, but since it&#039;s very long and &quot;messy&quot; i want to list here suggested drugs. I know that SR forums are not meant for this, but i hope no one minds this here&nbsp; ::) Im hoping to get advices without me trying every drug i find.<br />The reason im willing to try drugs to my condition is that i have already once have ptsd and this may cause it to lead as c-ptsd(might be already, i try not to think details).<br /><br /><br />Here is list of drugs mentioned in my previous post and also found by myself(in my understanding it&#039;s important, that when used for therapeutic uses the amount should be smaller than usual - bigger dose may lead to re-traumatization). If you have another suggestion, mention them. I might add them to list.<br /><br />- MDMA <br />&nbsp; This drug has biggest reputation in helping PTSD. I have tried it once(120mg), but i feel like smaller amount might have been more effective. Re-try is in my high consideration.<br /><br />- LSD <br />&nbsp; This drug is also mentioned, but 50% say its useful for mental problems and 50% say it may not be good for person with trauma/mental problems since it may easily lead to re-traumatization. Even in internet the opinions are divided. I would like to hear more opinions about this. It&#039;s in my potential list.<br /><br />- Marijuana<br />&nbsp; Also often mentioned helping in trauma symptoms. I myself have used kannabis tea at night when i dont wish to see nightmares. Marijuana in my opinion only works as an aid for symptoms and ptsd is probably easier to handle with it because kannabis has effect of mildly disturb the memory. However it probably doesn&#039;t help cure the ptsd, but its great help for symptoms.<br /><br />- Ketamine<br />&nbsp; This was mentioned me in other thread of mine. As well as MDMA this drug could and should be used only in few session, since in my understanding it may cause brain damage in frequent use. On the other hand it has been reported to have very positive effects on depression in only one dose. I would like to hear opinions about this.<br /><br />- DMT<br />&nbsp; Another psychedelic. Also recommended, but like LSD the opinions are divided. In my personal research i have found out that its &quot;safer&quot; drug than many to use, since brains naturally have this. It&#039;s in my potential list.<br /><br />- Mushrooms<br />&nbsp; The are probably many of these. Since i don&#039;t know any i only ad this because its also one potential choice. I though need to know more about this.<br /><br />- D - cycloserine<br />&nbsp; Never mentioned here and neither in my knowledge it can&#039;t be bought from SR. It&#039;s though mentioned in PTSD research to be able to help in &quot;reprogramming&quot; memories.<br /><br />- PSOP<br />&nbsp; There were article about this in my other thread. Mushrooms.<br /><br />- BDNF<br />&nbsp; Mentioned in PTSD research. Not available in SR. Also ability to reprogram memories.<br /><br />-Propranolol<br />&nbsp;Beta-blocker. Mentioned in some PTSD research. Available in SR.<br /><br />Cortisol reducing drugs(stress hormone cortisol is behind many mental illnesses and reducing it has also shown to give positive memories more room in ptsd treatment):<br /><br />- ketoconazole (Nizoral) /SR<br />- mitotane (Lysodren) /not in SR<br />- metyrapone (Metopirone) /not in SR<br /><br />Other<br /><br />- GHB <br />&nbsp; This is mentioned to be taken after MDMA. Im not sure what kind of effects it would individually have. It&#039;s in my list.<br /><br /><br />Most important thing in my opinion in treatment of ptsd would be ability to access all memories and feelings about trauma without the (uncontrollable)fear present aka bring feeling of safety while exploring them. With this in mind, i hope to hear opinions. This thread is located in newbie section so that everyone can join.<br /><br />And in my traditional way: Thank you for all help.

				I take:<br /><br />Zolfot<br /><br />Lamotrigine <br /><br />Abilify<br /><br />For the PTSD and a slew of others for pain. They keep me from going postal so I guess they work.
