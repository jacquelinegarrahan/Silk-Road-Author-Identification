				Hello.<br /><br />I came across SR about a month or so ago - I was blown away at how efficient and effective it works, and since then I&#039;ve been doing my research, taking my time to learn how the system works, piece by piece until I&#039;m completely confident to start using it.<br /><br />But I still have a few questions - my first one is about where to deliver to. I currently live in a rented house with 5 other people, and I&#039;m curious to know if it&#039;s secure to put my address down or to say, collect a package from a local Post Office.<br /><br />My other question is about Bitcoins - where is the best place to buy them? I&#039;ve looked throughout the forum as well as the Buyer&#039;s Guide wiki several times and there are a few vendors that seem to be secure, but again, I&#039;m interested to know what other experienced users of SR have to say.<br /><br />I apologise in advance if these kind of questions have popped up millions of times before - but I wasn&#039;t really sure where else to put this, and I&#039;m eager to learn more from people who have more experience with SR than me.<br /><br />Thanks in advance and nice to meet you,<br />mozambiqua.

				Welcome! I answered all of your questions as if you were in the USA lol so hopefully it works.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m curious to know if it&#039;s secure to put my address down or to say, collect a package from a local Post Office.&quot;<br /><br />-You should be fine to collect things from your address. My recommendations keep it for personal use and stay domestic. If you want anything more you have to figure out where to send your stuff. Its all about saving your own ass the more you do that the better you feel about your packages.<br /><br />As for bitcoins research bitinstant.com although they can be a hassle but their support is good and great on the bitcointalk forum. Another item to look into is blueskytraders, They allow you to deposit money without id at any bank of America. Its fast easy and anonymous. Search blueskytraders on the forum.<br />

				I&#039;m a UK user, but that&#039;s okay, ha.<br /><br />I plan to keep it domestic and light, so that&#039;s reassuring. I&#039;m still a bit confused about what the policy on collection with my postal service is, but that&#039;s not really a SR issue<br /><br />As for Bitcoins, do those sites work for UK users?<br /><br />Thanks for the speedy response! I appreciate it very much

				haha oops. You being in the UK im sure youll find everything you need very easily. <br /><br />As far as getting bitcoins blueskytraders also does cash in the mail i believe but youll have to do research on that but they are very reputable around here.<br /><br />always a pleasure,<br /><br />-Pinkfox
