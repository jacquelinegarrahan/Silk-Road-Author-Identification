				So if I buy bitcoins that can be traced to me and send them to silk road will LE know that I&#039;m buying drugs? Anyone been busted this way or is it not worth worrying about?

				I think you&#039;re OK if you use a new SR btc address EVERY SINGLE time that you make a transfer. Just make sure that your transfer goes through before you change your address, otherwise you&#039;ll lose the coin.<br /><br />As for them being able to determine that it&#039;s a SR btc address, no they don&#039;t. But depending on how you&#039;ve purchased the coins, the can trace them to you. They won&#039;t know that the btc address belongs to you though.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say, for example though, you buy coins on an exchange (DON&#039;T!) and then transfer them straight to your SR account. After that, you make a purchase from a vendor who appears legitimate, but who actually is LE posing as a vendor. Now they&#039;ve got your real name and address (if you used your real addy); they can identify where the coins came from by following the blockchain back to Gox (just using them as an example). They can subpeona Mt Gox and get your clearnet IP. That will of course match your real home address. Now try denying you made the purchase when they make a controlled delivery and arrest you. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Stay away from the exchanges. I haven&#039;t found a completely anonymous way to purchase coin. There are cameras everywhere, so if you&#039;re depositing cash, you&#039;re on cam. It&#039;s really not likely they&#039;re going to be checking cams unless you&#039;re already under surveillance. Just try to stay low profile and you&#039;ll be fine. I&#039;ve been buying safely for over 2 years (and I started using Dwolla and Gox --&nbsp; how stupid that was and how lucky am I?).

That&#039;s beyond a reasonable doubt to the average person (which is what the jury would be made up of). They&#039;re not going to buy that it&#039;s a coincidence or conspiracy.<br /><br />Something like that is only going to happening on very large purchases. They need to have enough evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but they don&#039;t have to prove you&#039;re involved in every single step of the transaction to prosecute you.

If LE sent you drugs you&#039;d be busted and no further evidence would be needed. In order for them to trace your bitcoins they would have to start at the point where you initially purchased the bitcoins. And even if they did that, which would be ridiculous, there would be no connection between a Silk Road purchase and a bitcoin purchase. Anyway all you would have to do is send the coins from an exchange to a new personal wallet before sending them to Silk Road and there wouldn&#039;t be any way to prove that the coins from the wallet address to Silk Road had anything to do with you.

The reason I brought that up is because there seems to be a misconception perpetuated on these forums that you have plausible deniability if arrested on a controlled delivery, and that&#039;s just flat out untrue. It&#039;s better not to answer the door when your expecting a package.<br /><br />And yes, that&#039;s off topic, but that&#039;s why I mentioned it<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And even if they did that, which would be ridiculous, there would be no connection between a Silk Road purchase and a bitcoin purchase.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you purchase $1000 coins and buy $975 worth of drugs, that&#039;s close enough. Nobody&#039;s going to buy that&#039;s a coincidence. People tend to buy exactly what they need for their purchase on the exchanges because the exchange rates are so volatile. <br />

				Thanks guys that&#039;s all useful info. That Forbes link answers my question I think. <br /><br />If I understand it right LE could build a (large) list of silk road deposit addresses and follow back the coins through the block chain to exchanges that require ID or at the very least places that don&#039;t allow Tor. Then they&#039;ve got your info and could target your mail. So basically you can never use these places safely. Given that 90 % of people don&#039;t even use pgp, would it be fair to say that LE could have a far more detailed picture of what&#039;s going on than most people think? This worries me.

Oddly enough, I cited it on another answer for a different topic, so I didn&#039;t read that far down.<br /><br />I&#039;m&nbsp; surprised that they&#039;re claiming they&#039;ve identified 300+k that belong to the &quot;drug market.&quot; With that said, they&#039;re not saying they&#039;ve identified them as SR; there are other markets.

				You should tumble the coins before sending them to SR so that coins sent to TOR dont match the ones bought by you. Some btc exchanges will take your coins if the wallet is on the deepweb so tumbling then into a wallet then to SR is the best. A guy had his coins taken off him for sending them to and from SR but he didnt tumble so.........
