				Alright so,&nbsp; 8)<br />My friend wants to send me about 7-9 grams of M1 *Methylone* but he&#039;s kinda scared and sketchy since it&#039;s his first time shipping. Btw he&#039;s shipping domestically USA from a state to another. I know this isn&#039;t the right board to post this on, but since I&#039;m still a newbie I can&#039;t post on the shipping board. I need advice on the best method to ship it. I told him to double vacuum seal it, crush the crystals a little, and place the bag in a DVD case carefully so he could ship via Priority or Express through a padded envelope. Does he need to use his real name and address when shipping? And does he need to provide my real name on the label? And what are the risks? <br />Hoping for an answer, Thanks!

				Use gloves so there&#039;s no finger prints. He should use a good fake company name for the return address but you need to use your real address. He should drop it off somewhere away from him to get shipped out. Domestic I wouldn&#039;t be too worried so the DVD case sounds like a pretty sound idea. Maybe try and seal the DVD case or something to make it look more legit/the post office wont be able to open it up as easily

Idk if sealing the DVD case would necessary but just taping it will do fine so it could look more legit. I don&#039;t have to use my real name if the envelope doesn&#039;t require a signature right? and USPS can&#039;t search a package without a warrant as I understand. Thanks for the advice again!

				BUMP! Anyone could answer me this ^^^^^^<br /><br />Also if he ships to a P.O. Box under a different name than mine, can the name be different from the P.O Box&#039;s if the envelope doesn&#039;t require a signature?

				you don&#039;t want to raise any suspicion to the package/envelope, so using the correct name is wise, but not necessary.<br />you can test by just mailing you&#039;re self a letter with the fake name see if it turns up ::)..<br /><br />also receiving mail with drugs isn&#039;t illegal unless you&#039;re knowingly doing so.. worst case, deny, deny,.. deny!..&nbsp; <br /><br />make sure the person shipping, takes some short of measure of smell proofing. with some sort of MMB like mylar packing..<br /><br />tell him wear gloves wipe everything down with rubbing alcohol..&nbsp; always use a legit looking return address..&nbsp; an make that package look like any other parcel there :)<br /><br />hope that helps some.. read through the shipping threads you&#039;ll find more then you need there.<br />

				Use your real name and address, it is much better. Don&#039;t use a P.O. box or a false name, it is just a waste. Deniability is actually worse with a P.O. box and with a false name you risk of the package not being sent to you.<br /><br />You want to blend the package as much as possible with usual mail you receive. The less complicated the better, the more normal the better.<br /><br />Naturally if then you plan on becoming a reseller the thing will change, but in that case you need to do completely different things.
