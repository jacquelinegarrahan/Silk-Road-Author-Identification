				We have recently given out a number of free test samples so that members could test the quality of our product. Please leave comments and reviews here. Please remember the coke is not being sold as 90% and is around half the price of other UK vendors so please bear the price in mind when you write your review..thanks guys&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				UPDATE: Hey people, We will be making a couple of slight changes after taking some advice from some very experienced members. We are generally wholesalers of cocaine and so currently the smallest weight we have advertised one ounce (28 grams). Until we build up a bit of trust and a good reputation we have decided to list some smaller amounts starting from 3.5 grams. I will post on the board once the changes have been made. Also the coke we have listed is our offline best seller- don&#039;t get me wrong it is VERY good quality for the price but not &quot;pure fishscale&quot;. We will also be listing pure fishscale flake cocaine over the next few days so that we have something to cater for all tastes and budgets...will keep you all posted on updates... ;)

				The package arrived in good time and I can say the stealth was more than was needed. I must also make a massive point on how good comms where with the new vendor, something I feel is important, I know vendors get a lot of messages but for me we are in the end customers and keep the customer happy then business should be good. I expect shine69 will be doing good business. <br /><br />Despite being a sample of half a gram I still weighed it, this is more because I have a new set of precision scales, the sample was very generously over.<br /><br />The look of the coke and when racking up a line was more to the chalky side.<br /><br />When snorting the coke it did not have a harsh burn in stead a nice mellow feel. I do not have a test kit and the purity is advertised as at 60% form my experience I can say that after a few mins of snorting a line I had a good buzz and the 60% I would more than agree with.<br /><br />The over all feeling was good a nice buzz with a slow onset of euphoria but no heavy rush. I had a nice numb feeling on my teeth which even I have not been getting from some of the top quality cokes from SR not sure what that means but some of you may have an idea. This is the kind of coke I like I do not want to the feeling of my heart pumping so hard that I might burst.<br /><br />I would say that I was doing normal size lines for me and doing them around every 30 mins.<br /><br />A final important aspect is after the session can you sleep, and I went to bed after an hour of finishing the sample and slept fine. I also woke the next day with no blocked nose which is another good sign an no coke hangover.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The person I did this sample with had the following to say about the product.<br /><br />&quot;It was like a Nandos sauce ( which I like Nandos sauce a lot ) which is smooth and creamy initially but follows up with a nice kick and tingle.&quot; <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I believe just because this was a sample that it is important to write an honest review and as such I have done so so others can make a decission based apon my expirence.<br /><br /><br />If you have any questions please message me and I will do my best to answer them.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packaging was good and arrived quick. Product was decent nice clean buzz and no jitters.It sort of creeped up over bout 10mins and after that lasted for quite a while before I had the urge to do another line.Overall good coke and good vendor what more could you want.Order with confidence

				Thank you for the excellent review. I have been leery of making more than a 1g or .5g acquisition, without testing the quality for myself. Also the pricing is quite reasonable, and when the funding arrives can see myself taking the product out for a long range reconnaissance patrol.

				I received a sample from Shine69, I was very impressed with the quality! I&#039;m no noob to coke and buy locally and on here. It&#039;s very well priced and very similar price/quality I get on the street! - I&#039;d recommend Shine69&#039;s gear, good weights, good gear, great stealth!<br /><br />Thanks man, I&#039;ll be putting an order in soon! <br /><br />DK23

				Below is a post I made in another thread, thought it would be best to paste it here.......<br /><br /><br />From my experience with many UK coke dealers on the road (and a handful outside the UK) I&#039;d definitely agree that this is the best value for money coke I&#039;ve bought on the road.<br /><br />My gram arrived less than 24 hours after ordering it.&nbsp; It came in a solid rock and was 15% overweight.&nbsp; The price was £65 and it was sent by next day delivery for free.<br /><br />It powders very easily and fluffs up well.&nbsp; The quality is exactly as described on the listings - it isn&#039;t high purity but the price more than reflects this.&nbsp; I feel that 2gs of Shine69&#039;s coke would give you far more actual cocaine than a single gram of very high purity&nbsp; coke from say Lloydsbrothers (who charge around £120 per gram).<br /><br />Normally whenever I have coke that isn&#039;t very high purity my nose gets completely blocked the next day and if a session goes on for a good few hours - by the end of it I&#039;m completely unable to snort anymore.&nbsp; This seems to be caused by the cutting agents rather than the coke itself since very pure coke doesn&#039;t do this to me.&nbsp; I was therefore very surprised to get no congestion whatsoever from Shine69&#039;s coke (either during the session or the next day).&nbsp; In no way am I saying that their coke is free of cuts because its clearly at least 40% cut but whatever it is cut with has no adverse physical effects on me.&nbsp; It seems to be completely inactive.&nbsp; There was no anxiety, no jitters and no strong urge to re-dose - the comedown simply isn&#039;t noticeable and I could sleep easily two hours after my last line.<br /><br />I really wish that all dealers cut their coke (if they must) with whatever Shine69 (or their suppliers) cut theirs with.&nbsp; It makes a huge difference to the experience and means I don&#039;t have to suffer for my sins the next day. <br /><br />I&#039;ve bought a lot of coke of Dispater in the past but his coke does aggravate my nose (not a reflection on his coke necessarily - I just have a shit cocaine hoover) and I have noticed lately that I have trouble sleeping after it.&nbsp; If Shine69 can keep up the standard of coke, generosity and speed of delivery then I&#039;ll be getting most of my mid-quality coke off them in future.<br /><br />In summary....<br /><br />*Good quality coke<br />*Excellent value<br />*Inactive and non-irritating cut<br />*Next day delivery<br />*Great comms and a pleasure to deal with<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on doing an acetone wash with the next lot I buy from Shine69.&nbsp; I&#039;m not expecting to lose more than 40% in the wash.

				Hi All, <br /><br />I thought I&#039;d share my experience with Shine and his product as I have a spare 10 minutes this morning. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a lot of the domestic coke vendors (LB, Dispater, DrCol, theXchange, MrMud etc. . ) and have reviewed a few of them for the good of the community. I only review those that I&#039;ve ordered more than 3.5g from at least twice so I can get a feel for the product and the vendor.<br /><br />Some here may remember the glowing review I gave theXchange a while ago (which stands for the product, for the vendor not so much) so I hope this review doesn&#039;t put the mockers on Shine!<br /><br />Firstly Shine has been a true gent when communicating, answering questions almost immediately and always politely. <br /><br />Shipping has also been reliable with all orders placed after 11am going out the next day using the shipping option chosen (I only say this because some other vendors haven&#039;t done tracked when requested and vice versa). <br /><br />Stealth has been fine for domestic, although could be better (Lloyds Bro&#039;s stealth for instance is my &#039;golden sample&#039; when it comes to stealth). <br /><br />The product (i&#039;m specifically talking about the 60% stuff and not the premium which I&#039;ve yet to try) is very, very good for the price. Other mid-market products I&#039;ve tried have active cuts and tend to be on the speedy / jittery side and also tend to block the nose and make sleep difficult. Shine&#039;s product however doesn&#039;t seem to have any active cuts as far as I can tell. <br /><br />Each delivery has been a single rock ( even the two 7g orders I&#039;ve placed) and cuts up nicely - it&#039;s somewhat &#039;chalky&#039; but this isn&#039;t a problem and in my view is preferable to some of the &#039;wetter&#039; product from other vendors. <br /><br />All orders have been overweight apart from 1 which was .05 under on a g. But Shine added 0.15 to the next order - super customer service !<br /><br />The coke goes up smooth with a nice but not overly strong numbing after 5-10 minutes - nice to find a product that doesn&#039;t overly numb to the point of it being down to a cutting agent. <br /><br />The product gives a nice euphoria without a massive urge to re-dose frequently and is, considering the price, bang on. <br /><br />I&#039;m somewhat wary of recommending a new vendor as my go to guy after the Xchange fiasco a couple of months back, but if Shine keeps this up then they will likely become a huge presence in the coke category. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got another order hopefully coming by the weekend and will update this thread if my perspective changes at all. Im also going to do a bit of a &#039;homebrew&#039; and mix a g of Lloyds Bro&#039;s with 1.5 o shine&#039;s product and see if that works out. I&#039;ve found Lloyds Bro&#039;s product to be exceptional but expensive, so a mix of the two might just make it last longer :).<br /><br />Erl. <br />&nbsp;

				Just got my high quality through by next day delivery.I ordered in the morning it was mark as dispatched the same afternoon and arrived in the post the next day. I have had problems with delivery times in the past from other vendors and I put it down to vendor turn around. But no problems here.<br /><br />So the stealth was good if you ask me way too good. Once i got the product out I weighed it and it was nicely over (thank you )<br /><br />First snort on the nose was strong and had a bite to it and I got a proper rush ( not done any in a month ) but I settled down and did small lines ( it is quite strong stuff ). It had the right smell and felt good. The stuff went down really well and I would highly recommend&nbsp; as very good value for money.<br /><br />Thank you very much shine69. I much prefer your strong stuff and am glad you are covering the whole market.<br /><br />I know where my nose is going to shop next time and its the little bit extra that swings it as well as the strength of the coke for me.

				Fast shipping, great stealth with moisture barrier bags, and honest quantity of product (my scale which isn&#039;t the best told me it was overweight). Pure cocaine was indeed of great quality, estimated&nbsp; 75-80% (out of 89% max purity for HCL). Probably the best value for money on the Road at this moment.

				Well I just got my half G through and it was definately on the better side of the half G of pure coke I ordered.&nbsp; <br />First I want to say that the picture of the brick you have on your vendors page was the thing that first caught my eye - it made me think that if you are dealing with that much then you are not going to scam a small user like myself - it is such a great pic also - and it seems I was correct. <br /><br />I have been a die hard Lloyds BRos buyer as the guy is very polite and I have not bad thing to say about him or his product but I seen the great write ups for you, and better prices, so decided to try yourselves for a change.<br /><br />I honestly cannot put anything between you two quality and service wise but I must say that you win on price and probably on quantity - will this always be the case, we will see.<br />The quality must be the high side of 80% IMO and lasted for an age.&nbsp; I actually snorted a tiny bit and iv&#039;d the rest of the line but thought I might have fucked up with the rush I got but it has steadied out into a lovely relaxed type, almost euphoric state with absolutely no edgyness.&nbsp; I could smell the petrol when I beaked it which is always comforting.<br /><br />You are charging a fiver for the postage - just wondering if this is because you used to do a faster post but changed it for security, as you mention on your vendors page, but left the price the same?&nbsp; because of the cheap coke it still works for me.&nbsp; Also you obviously put the time in on the packaging which you could probably cut down on and still be good.&nbsp; It tool me a while to get at the rock, that being said it is better safe than sorry and it shows that corners are not cut with this man.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cosidering there is about fifteen quid difference to the other best vendor on UK SR how can I afford to go anywhere else!<br /><br />I can see that you have a ton of orders over the last month that you have been here and I can tell you are going to be one of the biggest vendors if you keep up the good service/prices/quantity/quality.&nbsp; I hope you can keep up with the amount of customers that are coming your way and keep the quick postage and good comms then this is what will keep you in front in the UK IMHO.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck with that!<br /><br /><br />Thank you shine69 for a great experience.<br /><br />Shopper

				Hi All, <br /><br />I&#039;ve got to add that I&#039;ve dealt with Shine on many orders now (both his &#039;good&#039; listing and the &#039;pure&#039; listing) ranging from 1 to 7g per order and his customer service, product and shipping is unbelievable for a new vendor. <br /><br />Respect where it&#039;s due, Shine69 is top class. <br /><br />Orders are prompt, comms polite and fast, orders overweight and stealthly and the pure product is as good, if not better than LloydsBro&#039;s - and it&#039;s cheaper. <br /><br />All in all a great new addition to the road.

				Just placed an order with SHINE69<br /><br />Sent the BTC direct as I was a tiny bit short for what I wanted and he was kind and polite and helped me out, since he&#039;s been selling a lot and has high feedback I thought I&#039;d take the risk.<br /><br />5/5 for communication so far.<br /><br />Will write full review when received, can&#039;t wait :D<br /><br />Update!!<br /><br />Ok so I don&#039;t really know what to say... Next day delivery, perfect stealth, banging product. 2 to 3 times better than the stuff you get in this town for £50 a g and its only the good quality stock.<br /><br />Weighed 0.15 over which was nice considering I didn&#039;t pay the full amount and Shine69 let me off a few bucks.<br /><br />First buy on SR and he will be my only supplier from now on.<br /><br />10/5 Communication<br />10/5 Stealth<br />10/5 Product for price<br />

				I&#039;ve just received my first product from Shine69, I don&#039;t usually buy domestic due to the price, but he is very competitve!&nbsp; Product took 2 days to arrive, the good quality version.&nbsp; Stealth and packaging fine, communication good, and product is excellent for the price.&nbsp; You won&#039;t be disappointed if you shop here.

				The pure stuff is some of the best I have tried - hands down, and I&#039;ve used all of the high prices UK vendors, a bunch of dudes from the US, Canada, Holland - I&#039;ve sampled quite a few vendors you could say. <br /><br />So euphoric and rushy, lovely stuff.&nbsp; I still have a fair bit of my 3.5 left (although I did tuck in to it much harder than I&#039;d originally planned, it was just that good) - I hope the quality continues. <br /><br />

				Hi guys,<br /><br />As promised we have had our product re-tested by a SR member in Switzerland (free of charge I might add). As expected they do not match pineappleloves results and confirm what me (and hundreds of satisfied customers) have said from the start. The mid grade did come back at a slightly lower purity than I expected (51%) but as I always stated the only cutting agent picked up in the test was Benzocaine. Our premium product came back at over 90% which I didn&#039;t think was possible from (what I had heard 89% was the maximum, but obviously not). Check out the images of the test result documents below-<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/4z8gq2k7x/<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/r7idlfrsf/

				Hi,<br /><br />So I have placed numerous orders on the road for toot from all the major vendors. I have now placed 6 different orders total with shine. I have found his product, price and overall customer service to be the best of all the vendors I have tried. <br /><br />His stealth and packaging pleases me. With other vendors and their &quot;vaunted&quot; stealth methods there have been numerous times at the end of the night when I have known that I have not gotten every milligram of the product I have paid for. This is not the case with Shine&#039;s method, each and every time I&#039;ve ordered I have gotten every last milligram up my nose. For UK2UK there will be no problems with how he chooses to package the product.<br /><br />I have tried both products A and B and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the A product is the best i&#039;ve ever tooted and i&#039;ve done quite a bit in my time. <br /><br />The first five orders that came were all significantly overweight with one 1g order of the A product being 30% over!!! <br /><br />The last order that I placed was for 3.5g of the A product and was placed on a friday when he had a reduced number of his listings offered. To help me out he cancelled the order but unfortunately I got screwed with a drop in the value of the coin. I also f&#039;d up sending him my details, to atone for all of this, none of which really was his fault he sent me way over and above what could be expected as reasonable compensation. I&#039;m not going into major specifics here because I don&#039;t to attract the legion of scammers out there to his product but you can take it from me; if something goes wrong or there are any issues and you have solid stats behind you Shine will most likely take better care of you than your own mother would.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t tried him yet or are mulling over who to go with for your next purchase I would urge you to strongly consider giving him a try. Nothing in this life is for certain but there is a very high probability that you won&#039;t be disappointed and only fractionally less of a chance that you&#039;ll have found your go to guy for toot on the road.<br /><br />The Pott!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				See above:<br /><br />Gram arrived on Tuesday (ordered on Saturday, so couldn&#039;t expect it ANY earlier - many thanks for fast service)<br /><br />Packaging was very good, not amazing, but probably more than needed for domestic. Altogether happy.<br /><br />Next step was to weigh the contents: I weighed on a 0.00g scale the package, then put the contents into my own container, then weighed the original package.<br /><br />I was happily surprised to find that I had been sent a certain (quantity withheld) percentage over the advertised weight. Suffice it to say that it was a fair deal.<br /><br />Before even trying it I was delighted by the sparkly quality of the gear. It wasn&#039;t in a block, but the whole thing was in a single lump, which easily separated under slight pressure. All along it reflected the light like a bag of diamond fragments.<br /><br />Chopping was easy, but I&#039;m sure it would behave better after a couple of hours drying out over a lamp, or some such gentle heat source.<br /><br />On snorting, no irritation at all: a smooth, clean line, taking about 5-10 mins to kick in with a very clean high (no jaw clenching, etc). Very slight numbness, but nothing major, which indicates a lack of active cuts, and also demonstrates how massively cut cheaper cokes can be.<br /><br />Nice, smooth, long-lasting buzz, highly recommended.<br /><br />Thanks, Shine69

				POSSIBLE BAIT AND SWITCH<br /><br />This was my second order from shine69. The first was easily one of the best grams of coke I&#039;ve ever purchased; it reminded me of the stuff I used to buy when I had a friend who made a living selling coke. This second was one of the worst. I tested with an EZ Test cocaine cut kit and it tested positive for phenacetin / paracetamol / aspirin (they are all the same colour). The colour change also hovered around benzocaine and lidocaine for a while too. The consistency of the mix was very poor too. Some lines were average, some were amazing, and others had no anesthetic in them at all! Imagine snorting a line of aspirin; it was painful. Whoever put it together must have used the salt&#039;n&#039;shake approach to bashing, i.e. stick it in bag and mush it all together.<br /><br />I contacted shine and he accepted that he&#039;d received complaints from other customers, he&#039;d managed to get his supplier to take the gear back, and he&#039;d received good stuff again. He offered me a bit more on my next order. I said I didn&#039;t want more on my next order, I wanted the high quality gram I thought I&#039;d ordered. Remember: he presumably got a replacement from his supplier, why shouldn&#039;t I get one from him? His response was ugly; he accused me of trying to scam or blackmail him. You, my dear reader, can be the judge, but note that I&#039;ve finalised without even attempting resolution. I don&#039;t care about the money, I just want someone who can send me high quality coke. If shine were willing or able to send out the high quality stuff he sent first time, I don&#039;t see why anyone on the road interested in proper coke would ever go anywhere else. He could charge a fair bit more than what he is at the moment too.<br /><br />Either shine69 is padding his margins by selectively scamming, or his quality control is seriously lacking. It&#039;s impossible to say, but what I can say is that he doesn&#039;t give a shit about customer service. It&#039;s also worth noting that my EZ Test results agree with a lab test of his lower quality &quot;good quality coke&quot; posted on the forums, which showed phenacetin: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=212523.msg1543279#msg1543279
