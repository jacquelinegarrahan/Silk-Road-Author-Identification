				Been thinking about this for a while.&nbsp; Would there be any interest in a sampler package with 1 tab from some of the more popular vendors? For example a tab from JOR, JC, Jannis and a tab from albion. I would of course allow the avengers to test each tab, and I will be buying in bulk from each seller. (100 tabs at a go)<br /><br />Anyone see any problems? I plan to offer first class, priority, and overnight express.

				LSD is so easy, cheap, and safe to ship internationally (fast too given it&#039;s usually in a letter) so unless you can offer really good pricing or some other advantage (domestic isn&#039;t an advantage here because of the nature of shipping LSD...), then you probably wont do as well as you think. If you cold price 5-hit samplers around 40 bucks you&#039;d make a killing and sell many, many tabs.

Is this what the price is, or what you think it should be? No way to make any money off $40 5 tab samplers.

				None of them have good enough prices in bulk to allow your idea to be profitable. JOR won&#039;t even scale down his price for 1000 hits. People would much rather pay less to get LSD directly from the vendors. When reselling another&#039;s product, it&#039;s best to sell it in a different market, unless you sell it cheaper than they do, which you won&#039;t be able to do.

				That 15 dollar per tab price is why those vendors don&#039;t make a huge amount of sales and probably sell 1-2 sheets at a time.<br /><br />I know the prices you&#039;re getting for bulk. You can easily do strips for 80 if you&#039;re not greedy. Most people are not. Look at the Vendor JackieChan. He&#039;s doing it right domestically, once he can offer bulk it will be even better

When did UNICEF get into the LSD business?&nbsp; If you sell JC gandof at 80 a strip thats a whopping $170 per 100 tabs of acid sold.

				I&#039;m currently waiting on a large order from Haizenberg, who offers similar prices. I&#039;ll definitely report back once I finally get it. I feel like the older LSD vendors are able to charge what they want because there is so much trust in their product. The newer vendors have to have cheaper prices because otherwise there is no reason to buy from them.

				I&#039;m stopping you there. You missed the boat. LSD is not any more dangerous to ship internationally than domestically, especially with the shipping methods most vendors use now.<br /><br />

				Well LSD overseas is in transit much longer, possibly in heat longer, possibly degrading more, that&#039;s my issue with overseas LSD that was pre-blotted.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, this would be the same or moreso because it is getting shipped 2 times.<br /><br />Also, I would want at least 2 tabs to trip, so 1 of each woulnd&#039;t cut it ( I guess I could buy 2 samplers).<br /><br />I personally feel that LSD degrades too rapidly in heat to ship in the summer as well.

				Monkey Toes, I was hesitant ordering LSD this summer for that very reason. After snooping around forums online I found many cases of people saying that heat degradation of LSD is actually very much exaggerated. I have read countless stories of people leaving their tabs in foil inside tents at summer festivals and tripping just fine off of them.

				bdylan123veevee, yea heat degradation is highly exaggerated, although heat degradation does happen it does not happen at the rate most people say.&nbsp; I received 25 tabs from JOR and unfortunately have no AC in US northeast as it is 90 degrees steady for the past few days, tabs have been fine and have not noticed a change in their effect.&nbsp; In terms of domestic samplers, I would just rather have my lsd from the source vendor.&nbsp; not too much handling and trustworthy to say the least.
