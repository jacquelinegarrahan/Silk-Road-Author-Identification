				Depending on class, and the country, it&#039;s obviously the amount you buy that makes a target to the cops. I was just wondering how large an order you&#039;d have to make (say of molly) for the cops to consider it&#039;d been worth chasing you, say if they busted a vendor and found your address and how much you&#039;d ordered.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As you said it yourself, it really depends on the country you live in. Even within a certain country there can be huge differences among states. Generally speaking, I would say everything below 5 g is not worth to be worried about

				I think it&#039;s a pretty common tactic for LE to bust small-time users, scare them with stories of getting butt-raped in prison, and intimidate them into giving up their connections. Do this enough times, and you&#039;re all the way at the top.<br /><br />I would advise against looking for reasons why your illegal activity (as opposed to another person&#039;s) is going to be of no interest to law enforcement. If you&#039;re breaking the law, think and behave as if you&#039;re breaking the law. If I have a gram in my pocket or a pound in my trunk, my mindset and subsequent precautions should be exactly the same.

				Somewhere between 100g&#039;s and a kilo, Below that theyd have way to many&nbsp; people to go after.
