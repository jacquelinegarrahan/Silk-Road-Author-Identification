				So i&#039;ve been using Coke very casually for a while..<br />I&#039;ve never used it every day but here and there at parties and such.<br /><br />Recently I bought some fishscale from 2 prominent vendors... <br />Never had really pure stuff I would imagine from the sources I used so I was curious.<br /><br />Wow coke can be much stronger than I&#039;ve really ever tried, couple lines of this stuff and I was floored whereas Ive been known to get depressed fast from a coke night and I end up drinking till I puke on the dance floor (very rare by the way ...) so this was a change when i was HIGH like 2 hours later leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />Come allergy season and my regular allergies are going nuts but I am easily able to curb this with meds.<br />I get some more coke from the same vendors but this time one of the bags REALLY MAKES ME SNEEZE AND REALLY GETS ME CONGESTED ALL DAY, like Rhinitis x 100, inside of my nose feels hard as a rock no air coming though. Use some sprays and wait a couple days and Im kinda thinking now... Maybe it wasnt the coke.. maybe it was just my allergies.. let me try again.. and this time I only do the coke that was OK the last time.<br /><br />I get TOTALLY stuffed again but a little more wet not a hard congestion style swelling in my sinuses like last time. This never happened to me ANY other time in the past even when dealing with things that may not even have been coke (just being dramatic but ya sometimes it wasnt too strong or pure)<br /><br />Now... Am I allergic to really pure coke maybe? Or is this stuff cut with something Im allergic to? <br /><br />Basically I couldnt do more right now if I wanted to, and it was like a perfectly clean no prob nose.. one line and Im dripping and swelling up like its hayfever season... <br /><br />I dunno Im kinda bummed but maybe Im just too allergic or maybe its cut.. I dunno.

				I know someone who can&#039;t do coke because they get very sick. Vomiting, headache, etc..<br /><br />This could be from the cocaine, or the adulterant, or the way it was processed. People can become allergic to a substance at any time. <br /><br />This may be a dumb idea, but you may want to try to freebase using the ammonia/solvent method,&nbsp; and see if you get the same reaction. It will get rid of the cut, but it also changes another one of the variables (hcl vs base).<br /><br />Moopy

				Who were the vendors if you are comfortable saying? I noticed some top vendors have really bad marks in the purity tests.

				I&#039;d really hate to rat them out especially because these peeps both don&#039;t seem to have any issues with this sort of thing. I think it may be a problem with my nose as I am very allergic to pollen and somehow it seems to be affecting me in the same way, but much more intensely.<br /><br />I&#039;ve really looked closely over their reviews/comments and other than the odd &quot;didn&#039;t seem pure to me&quot;&nbsp; most of the comments are all praising the quality/purity. Also one has a purity test posted but it was definitely from an older batch as he has just recently come back from vacation mode due to new supplier.<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;m gonna find a friend who will put this up their nose and let me know what they think.<br />Thanks for the responses.
