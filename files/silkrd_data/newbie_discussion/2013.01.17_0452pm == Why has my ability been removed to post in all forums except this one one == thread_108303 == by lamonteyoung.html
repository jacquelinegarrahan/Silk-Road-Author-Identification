				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />Not quite sure whats going on, but it would seem that I now cannot reply to anything on any of the other forums, and cannot find any support to message.<br /><br />All was fine yesterday.<br /><br />For the record, I have no intention of spamming threads with nonsense just to get to Member status, in all honesty I couldn&#039;t give a toss, all I care about is being able to ask some related SR questions, and attributing to the SR community a by posting product reviews and vendor feedback, and if the Newbee&#039;s are being restricted, I&#039;m sure this will be counter productive for them.<br /><br />If anyone can enlighten me [which might be rare as I have read only Newbee&#039;s can post in here????] it would be much appreciated.<br /><br />I hope its not some bureaucraticial nonsense

				I will enlighten you my dear fellow &quot;newbie&quot; some1 high up in the forums, came up with a STUPID idea to make everyone under 50 posts denied access to post at the forumm...exept here, that is.. so, just post, and post , and so on, until 50 posts are reached..<br /><br />Im luckily not to far away, still annoying as fuck...<br /><br />47 now.... you just need to post 31 more ;)

				Needs to be more reasonable, 50 posts is way too many for people who don&#039;t want to be spammy assholes. Up until this point I&#039;ve only made posts when I have useful info to provide or when I have a question that has not been asked/answered, and yes I did research before asking. I guess I&#039;ll just post random shit for today so I can use the forums again :(<br /><br />An approach I&#039;ve seen that seems to be very sensible was a mix of a small number of minimum posts and a time based limit, ie you&#039;re a newbie until you&#039;ve made 5 posts and been online for 3 hours.

				It is a shame.<br /><br />My earlier suggestion was to prevent newbies starting any new threads, which is what the spammers seem to want most to do, but continue to let newbies reply to threads. That way you can contribute meaningfully to interesting conversations started by established members, whereas in this forum... well, time will tell.

				This is one of the dumbest things I think the admins have done. Like you guys, I am not a new member but I also don&#039;t jump in on every discussion or start to flame someone for saying the wrong thing like I see 95% of the members here do. So now that I have less than 50 posts I am unable to post in the vendor reviews or even ask a question? Thanks admins! Great timing too! I placed an order on Tuesday and I need to get ahold of the vendor, however since I have less than 50 posts I can&#039;t even post in his thread to get ahold of him!( He has told me that it is easier to get in touch through the review thread) So thanks Admins! It&#039;s been nice to use SR for the past few months but I feel as if it is getting too big and they have no idea how to manage all the activity.

				Well, that explains it. I thought I got stealth-banned, but I couldn&#039;t imagine why. I posted a nice command line tutorial for GPG to be helpful, then suddenly I can&#039;t post replies thanking people for suggesting additions to it.<br /><br />So I guess we&#039;re spamming this forum until we hit 50. That&#039;s the trouble with restrictions -- people will always find the quickest and easiest path through them.
