				Post your story in as much or as little detail here. Make sure to start off with the name of the substance, and then tell where you feel is the best environment to trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Shrooms = in the woods<br /><br />

				Shrooms,<br />Go to a viewing platform or lookout, anywhere with a spectacular view. Go 1 hour before sunrise on a day predicted to be cloudless and drop your substance. If you time it right,&nbsp; it comes on as you greet the dawn. Its actually pretty good without the drugs too&nbsp; ;)

				Shrooms and a few beers (not liquor - too harsh) in the snow, in the dead of night.The contrast, the soft powder, the sensation of cold; highly conducive to frank, but hopeful thinking. Its not a very colorful trip but one I thoroughly enjoy. I once walked 4 miles in the snow, wandering around alone at night. Which wouldn&#039;t be so bad, except that I was wearing sneakers and barely registered how sopping wet and cold they were. When I got back to my apartment, my feet were already starting to tinge blue.
