				Hey everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought a few small shipments of MDMA domestically in the UK and Australia over the years, but I&#039;m considering starting to buy more stuff more often (in Melbourne). So, naturally, I&#039;m worried about my security.<br /><br />Currently I just have the stuff shipped to my real address under my real name. There are obvious problems with this. But what are the alternatives?<br /><br />I could try to get a private mail box from AusPost under a fake name and address. This would require forged proof of address documents (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/429ed8cedc) and a fake ID. Has anyone tried this? Does anyone know where I could get a fake ID? Many of the ones that come up via Google look like scams. Would this even be worth it?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard about people using other people&#039;s letter boxes via a master key (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c3ecdfceb6). How should I go about finding one that won&#039;t raise suspicion / be used often? Can the mail be addressed to any random name?<br /><br />Would love to hear how you guys keep safe when receiving domestically.<br /><br />Cheers!

				An easy idea would be to find an empty house that doesn&#039;t look empty and still gets mail sometimes. Look at the name on any piece of mail it gets, and somehow be able to get your stuff without looking suspicious

				Not quite sure how AUS post works regarding the security of receiving your mail. But in the US, its as easy as opening a PO BOX online, yes you can use real information. Be sure to sign up for some free newsletters or free catalouges or magazines under a non suspicious person (most likely someone real in&nbsp; your area from whitepages). This will start letting the postal carrier learn that the person name (Fictitious name) is possibly receiving mail at your po box address which is fine because anyone can use your box, friends, family etc. Now once you establish and let the postal carrier learn that user and it becomes apparent in there system and will not raise future flags or suspicion you can actually have a package or parcel sent to that name to your PO BOX. Also another good method I&#039;ve used numerous times when a customer doesnt include correct receiver name, I use default sender information which is: <br /><br />Current Resident<br />PO BOX 420<br />QUALITY, CA 42000<br /><br />I have never had an issue with this method for sending or receiving as when I dont trust a vendor with my information I tell them to use Current Resident and use your real address even. If the package makes it to you and it doesnt look like it was tampered with then you can accept the package and dont even open it til you are far away and the coast is clear! Trust me I have dealt with many different postal services and carriers in many locations and this works every time! I have even had packages sent to my real address and say my name is Gary Coleman, I sometimes would change it but keep it the same to not arouse suspicion, ie. Gary Cole and if they every ask you play the stupid card obviously. You cant get in trouble for a package showing up in your mail box.. You can only get in trouble if you KNEW that the package was coming and admitted to knowing what was in the box.. Otherwise it is not your job to prove your innocence but it is there jobs to prove your guilt.. which we are all innocent so you can just drop all worries ;)<br /><br />When in doubt, play stupid and act dumbfounded. If they catch you after you opened the package and with the product then you go further into your stupid act as in.. ie. well a package came to me in my box and was unsure if it was addressed to myself or another based on the unclear name on the package and it was in my mailbox so I decided to open it and check for myself, is that a crime? &quot;I had just started looking on the internet on what to do if drugs arrive in my mailbox&quot; as to get this to the proper authorities! <br /><br />Never admit to guilt as they cant prove you knew what was in the package nor who sent it and for what reason. Just stay calm and act like you have not a care in the world, never speak without an attorney present! That means don&#039;t even converse with the cops arresting you or questioning you in hopes to get released as this will only fuck you further. Play dumb take your ride to the station, await your attorney and tell him your sob story and how this is ridiculous and then you get charges dropped.. (if any are filed with DA, doubtful!) Just be smart and deal with LEGIT and TRUSTWORTHY vendors that know how to package and ship with stealth! Dont get held up by LE because some joker vendor was in a hurry wrapping your package! <br /><br />Hope that sums it up, I have many loyal clients in AUS and I have had 100% success rate and I will in fact ask them a few questions I have myself to further spread knowledge to future AUS customers! Whether it be my Superior Stealth Packaging or the fact I know how to present any package or parcel with the utmost business appearance with a return address from various sources we use to ensure EVERY package gets through and that is why we offer a 100% guaranteed delivery to our customers now. Out of just 110 transactions with this vendor account we have not had 1 package get seized or lost and if we ever had an issue it was because of a customer not providing accurate sender information, but we still even gave them benefit of the doubt and provided reship to show good faith. Any other information or input from others is always appreciated as we are a growing community where knowledge is power! The more knowledge everyone has the safer we can be! Feel free to checkout my vendor page and discussion reviews! And I had some issues with someone stealing this Forum account name and luckily had vendor support give me the rights, so now that I am aware of forums on SR I will try and take the time to be here for support and advice as well as to learn and benefit from the knowledge of others! Thank you for your time and thank SilkRoad for there amazing effort in providing the community with a great service like this it is an honor to be apart of this network and wish everyone the best! Take care friends!

				I have now had quite a bit of experience getting packages here in Australia.<br /><br />First always choose a vendor from the US/UK with good stealth. Cannot guarantee that you will get it but your chances are much higher then the Netherlands for example, I learnt the hard way.<br /><br />Second, buy a master key. Go to your local apartment block (with new letter boxes) and try your luck with this master key late at night. This works on about 80% of the boxes for me.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b18be0a843<br />I bought a key then got it cut 3 times so I had multiple copies as I once thought I lost it. Not good when you are expecting a package.<br /><br />Third, make up a name to use. You don&#039;t want to be opening the mailbox and spending 5 min to work out which one is yours. A few vendors recommend to actually use the name of the person living there but I have found no difference. Trust me you will know when a package arrives.<br /><br />Finally look at what times letters are dropped for that apartment block in your area. If you have a 9-5 job you will find this difficult but you don&#039;t want the owner of the apartment to have access to the letter before you!<br /><br />As a thought I have had a few letters that never arrived. What I found is that during this period regular letter drops for that address decrease. Not sure if the post office get a note to flag a certain address, then all of a sudden boom the mail starts again. Suggest to use a vendor with the least lead time as possible and select multiple addresses. This way you don&#039;t spend up to one month going back to this mailbox!<br /><br />Enjoy and party safe.<br />
