				*** Face Palm ****&nbsp; ???<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Yes.. when LSD is made it is in crystal form.. from there it is made into a solution most time with some sort of ethanol base or there abouts ( depends on the person there) .. from there it is then places on blotters.. OR the crystals can be crushed down and dissolved into other suspensions like breath drops.. I have seen H2O a few times but it was with the funny purple stuff and the crystals were not breaking down well.. The white fluff pretty much melts away..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I would love to find some old school Clan Chemist Hippy left over from the family days, assuming any are still around.. One that still believes in the Gift that LSD is and what it can do to help the world and individuals.... it all sounds like fairy tails now a days.. everyone just seems to be out to make a buck..&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\ I will still hold out hope.. maybe one day.. I would love to learn all they could teach and be able to pass that gift on to the world on tab at a time! ;D

				A pound would be soooo much money.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know how much it would be. I&#039;d imagine only chemists who produce LSD have seen that much at once.

				This guy, he comes into a bar, walks up to the Bartender and says, &quot;Bartender, I got me a bet for you. I&#039;m gonna bet you 300 dollars that I can piss into that glass over there and not spill a single solitary drop.&quot; The bartender says ... now one more time this glass is like a good ten feet away ... he says, &quot;Now wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You&#039;re trying to tell me you&#039;re gonna bet me 300 dollars that YOU can piss standing over here waaay over there, into that glass, and not spill a single drop?&quot; The guy looks up smiling and says, &quot;That&#039;s right.&quot; The bartender says, &quot;Young man you gotta bet!&quot; The guy says, &quot;Okay, here we go, here we go.&quot; He pulls out his thang. He&#039;s looking at the glass, man he&#039;s thinking about the glass, he&#039;s thinking about the glass, he thinks glass, he&#039;s thinking of the glass, think glass, thinking about his dick. Dick, glass. Dick, glass. Dick, glass. Be the glass. Dick, glass. Dick, glass. Dick, glass. And then SWOOOSH. He let&#039;s it rip! And he&#039;s ... he&#039;s pissin&#039; all over the place, man! He&#039;s pissin&#039; on the bar ... he&#039;s pissin&#039; on the stools, on the floor, on the phone ... on the bartender ... He&#039;s pissing everywhere EXCEPT the fucking glass! Right. Okay, so, bartender, he&#039;s laughing his fucking ass off, he&#039;s 300 dollars richer. He&#039;s like, &quot;Ha Ha Ha Ha.&quot; Piss drippin&#039; off his face. &quot;Ha Ha Ha Ha&quot; He says, &quot;You FUCKIN&#039; idiot, man. You pissed in everything EXCEPT the glass!! You owe me 300 dollars puta.&quot; And he goes, &quot;Excuse me, just one, one second.&quot; Goes in the back of the bar, and in the back there&#039;s a couple of guys playing pool. He walks over to them ... comes back to the bar and goes, &quot;Here you go Mr. Bartender, three.&quot; And the bartender&#039;s like, &quot;WHAT the fuck are you so happy about, you just lost 300 dollars you idiot?!&quot; The guy says, &quot;Well, you see those guys over there. I just bet them 500 dollars APIECE, that I could piss on your bar, piss on your floor, piss on your phone, and piss on YOU, and not only would you be not mad about it ... you&#039;d be happy.
