				Hi guys, this is my first transaction and i got the following message from the seller:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">many thanks for your order, unfortunately due to your purchasing stats I have to ask you to release your escrow before I ship the product.<br /><br />If it&#039;s ok we will follow the following procedure:<br /><br />1) You confirm that you agree to these conditions<br />2) I mark the product in transit<br />3) You finalize<br />4) I will send on the next delivery day<br /><br />I apologize for the inconvenience but there are certain measures we have to take.<br /><br />Please confirm that you comply to the procedure.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know the buyers guide says i should report him for it, but as i am new, i wanted to double check.<br /><br />Should i point him at the buyer&#039;s guide and tell him i&#039;d have to report him?

				Many many buyers do this will people who have no buyer statistics it is so they can protect themselves from scammers just making new accounts.<br /><br />The seller is doing NO WRONG. however there are vendors who let u stay in escrow with 0 Stats i recommend finding and using them to build your stats.<br /><br />Beware some vendors may selectively scam you as you have no authority around here. i recommend going with safe domestic easy buys first to endure yours and the buyers safety.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />-Pinkfox

				The seller doesn&#039;t want to get screwed by a potential scammer.&nbsp; Best to build up your stats on some &#039;safer&#039; buys that don&#039;t require fe and then you shouldn&#039;t have this probem.&nbsp; When you fe, you give the seller an easy opportunity to scam you if they wish.

				NO do not report him. Im sure in his terms of service on his profile page it say that about new buyers. If it doesnt then please advise him. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also agree do not purchase from him u need to save yourself as well.<br /><br /><br />You should buy from someone who allows escrow for new buyers.<br /><br />Many sellers do what he is doing and as far as i know it isnt against the rules. It sucks but think of it if you were a vendor and someone without stats kept buying and leaving a 1 out of 5 everytime. it can literally ruin business.<br /><br />-Pinkfox

				I&#039;d just buy small from a highly reputable seller and finialize early. I don&#039;t think any of the big sellers are interested in ripping off new buyers for a few pennies when they could just give them a good first experience instead and end up with a good customer&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I think it makes perfect sense for sellers to ask first timers to FE. It&#039;s obvious that it&#039;s more likely for someone to make a new account and try to scam a seller than for a seller to go out of their way to rob a newbie of a few bucks. Even if you finalize early you can still leave 1/5 feedback if they screw you over, and the reputable sellers don&#039;t want the 1/5, they just want to sell the drugs, make their profit, get good feedback and move on.

				yeah i seriously never FE..well actually i did the first time but it was for a single stamp bag. just do some small RC buys(if ur into that sorta thing) you can rack up some stats with as little as $100 if u buy small quanitities of RC&#039;s. just sayin is all.

				SOMEBODY LIKE RC&#039;S<br /><br />jk hahaha rc are great.<br /><br />Tesselated is great for new buyers def.<br /><br />I disagree about going with big sellers. They are more likely to not send your item due to sheer mail volume and personel issues.<br />Id recommend going with a very well trusted seller who isnt too big as you can communicate with them easy and theyll help u out even.<br /><br />What are you interested in? im sure i can point you in the right direction.<br /><br />-Pinkfox
