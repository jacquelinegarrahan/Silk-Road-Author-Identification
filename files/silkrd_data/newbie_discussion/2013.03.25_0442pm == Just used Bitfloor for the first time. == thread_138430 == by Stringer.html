				Easy as fuck, like taking candy from a candy hating baby. BOA teller didn&#039;t even ID me (Then again, I did only spend a minimal amount). It&#039;s supposed to take a half hour but it took a little over an hour for me. You should expect delays with these types of things anyhow as far as I&#039;m concerned. That&#039;s pretty much it. If you&#039;re able to use it and you can then use that shit!

				Yeah I also use bitfloor to make deposits, it&#039;s really easy and they don&#039;t ask for an ID! I don&#039;t why anyone in the US would pay 10% in western union fees + whatever the bitcoin seller is charging...

				You shouldn&#039;t use tor to access your bitfloor account since that could get you flagged and then they may require you to give them your ID (it happens like that with mtgox anyways). You should go to your bitfloor account using an anonymous computer like in a library or cyber-cafe. I haven&#039;t used bitfloor for really large amounts, but you can deposit amounts up to $5000 without having to show identification in most banks, so I think it&#039;d be the same with bitfloor. $10000 is the legal limit I think, but I may be wrong. I&#039;m not exactly sure about the amounts but you can check the laws and bank of america policies.

				I didn&#039;t use Tor but I did use a vpn. I&#039;ve pretty much gathered that using Tor to purchase the coins wasn&#039;t a good idea. Buying the coins themselves is in no way illegal to begin with though.

				Buying coins isn&#039;t illegal, but someone got busted because of a money trail to a bitcoin exchange site. They intercepted a package, and they used the money trail to get a warrant to search his house. They only charged him for the stuff they found in his home though, and not for the package he may have ordered. So you should still be anonymous when buying bitcoins, unless you&#039;re not buying things on silkroad.

				Newbie here with 2 questions. I transfered directly from bitfloor to SR about 10 minutes ago. How long does it typically take for me to see the coin in my SR account? Secondl, I&#039;ve used tor to access my bitfloor account, but have used chrome on my home computer whenever actually making deposits/withdrawls. Am I in any danger? Sorry if these are basic questions.

				See when finding out about SR and hearing that everything is done with Bitcoins I was like WTF are they. Upon further reading I started to get a good idea of what they were and how they were used but also amongst allot of negative info about all the scam sites and people stealing each others Bitcoins. I then came across MTgox but saw many warnings including from their own site that if they found out you are a Tor user they would freeze your account and investigate. I also read that even accessing MTgox on the same computer as Tor was risky. I was scared away from MTgox in the end and stumbled upon bitcoin-24.com by this point I was so fed up with worrying I just transferred Â£390 in and within an hour it was in my balance I bought bitcoins with nothing more than a username and password and really enjoyed my experience. I then transferred from there to my wallet then directly to SR to pay the vendor fees. I have deposited and withdrew there twice now and it has been fantastic :D

And accessing bitfloor through tor could get you tor or something like that, your anonymity for that tor session was compromised since you logged in to an account linked to your real identity. If you didn&#039;t do anything else on that session on tor then I guess it&#039;s no biggie except for maybe getting flagged. <br />You should always use an anonymous computer when doing those kind of things, and not tor, especially when withdrawing to SR!<br />You can always make a new bitfloor account on an anonymous computer and withdraw the funds from your old bitfloor account to the new one, but go through several anonymous wallets first, that way you&#039;ll have a more or less anonymous bitfloor account.<br />All in all you&#039;re not too fucked if you try not to make more mistakes like that in the future.<br /><br />URL is bitfloor.com
