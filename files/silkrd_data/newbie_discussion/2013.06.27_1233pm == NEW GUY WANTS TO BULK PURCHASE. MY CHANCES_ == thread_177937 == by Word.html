				It&#039;s up to you, but if you pick a good reliable reputable vendor you could offer to FE for the purchase. Yes that&#039;s more risk to you though. Some vendors might still be willing to ship, because basically as long as they provide a DCN showing delivery they&#039;re going to get their BTC.

				People are suspicious because the buyer, like the seller is expected to build up a reputation before they are trusted. The seller takes the risk of sending out the product only to have the buyer claim it never arrived and decline escrow.<br /><br />Bide your time a little, start small, build up a rapport with good sellers. Good things come to those who wait, or something :)<br /><br />

				Buying bulk right out the gates with no purchase history? Yeah, not very likely. As others have suggested, you should probably make a few purchases &amp; establish a reputation before trying to buy in bulk.

				I only have a few purchases under my belt and they were somewhat large for a first time buyer: 25 grams of shrooms and then 50 grams of shrooms. But I found a trusted vendor and FE. I think it is more than fair that us new guys have to prove ourselves.

				FE means Finalize Early, in other words, the vendor wants you to bypass the Escrow system and release your money to him before he sends you the goods.<br />As a newbie, you will come across this a lot, at least for 5 or maybe 10 transactions.<br />My advice is to avoid FE if you can, but as a newbie it maybe impossible, it depends on your purchase, or drug of choice.<br />So do your research, check the vendor out on this forum, there is a thread for nearly every drug and other categories too. Also the feedback on the Vendor&#039;s page and sometimes the item page. Take your time, buy small at first and as someone said above try and build a rapport with the vendor/s you wish to ultimately purchase bilk from, and then you will find it much easier.<br />And has someone said earlier, if you can choose a purchase with a tracking option, then it will much easier not to have FE because they will know, via the tracking, whether the package reached you or got seized by customs. You will probably have to sign though, but that never bothers me, but I am in UK so different rules apply I believe.

				Start small, once you have plenty of transactions go bulk, BUT DONT FE. It just begs to get scammed.
