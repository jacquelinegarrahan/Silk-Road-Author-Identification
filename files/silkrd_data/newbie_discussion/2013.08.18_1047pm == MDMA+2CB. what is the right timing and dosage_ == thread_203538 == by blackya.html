				<br />So guys, thought about trying MDMA+2CB<br /><br /><br /><br />People say one can combine it both ways: MDMA first and 2CB afterwards, and other way around (2CB first and MDMA after it) as well.<br /><br />I suppose both ways have their good advantages. Still eager to know which way is better to combine<br /><br />And is it true that 2CB diminishes the come-down effects of MDMA?<br /><br />would also like to know the right dosage for both substances and the timing between taking them<br /><br />cheers<br />

				i took 28mg of 2c-b and felt great. i was super high for like 4+ hours....2.5 of which was intense tripping.<br /><br />never thought about taking mdma w/ it though. the body high was great with the 2c-b, came on quite fast actually. then the full blown tripping started, and as i stated the peak was 2.5 hours or so....kind of was transported back to 1989 listening to grateful dead from 1989/10/9 Hampton Coliseum Hampton, VA.<br /><br />but as for the op....i say go out with a bang and first start off with a tenth or two of mdma, then when that starts to peak take 28mg of 2c-b?<br /><br />have you eaten 2c-b by itself before?

				Not sure which way round would be best, i did MDMA first, then 2cb, I snorted both.<br />If you do snort 2cb, be aware that it is THE most foul thing I have ever snorted, even made me puke after 15mins, I did 25mg and that was pretty strong! But trust me you wouldn&#039;t believe how much 25mg burns!<br />MDMA I did 170mg.<br />In future I would start with 20mg of 2cb, its well documented that once you go over 20mg each mg makes a big difference (i.e. 25 seems nearly twice as strong as 20)<br />I still had comedown after 5 hours, ketamine sorted that.<br />Have fun!<br />

				Yes 2C-B brings you right back up and eliminates the MDMA comedown, but you&#039;re going to feel strung out after that wears off. I recommend taking your normal MDMA dosage and after you feel the feeling tapering off take ~18mg of 2C-B
