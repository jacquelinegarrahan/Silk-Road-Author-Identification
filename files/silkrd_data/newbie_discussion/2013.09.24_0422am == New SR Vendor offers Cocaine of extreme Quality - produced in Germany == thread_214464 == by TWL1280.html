				Hi Everybody,<br /><br />we are new to the online community and a new vendor at Silkroad.<br /><br />We are the only once who are actually importing coca leaves instead of cocaine that went through many hands and no one knows what&#039;s in it.<br /><br />We refine the Cocaine HCL from the leaves in Germany and offer you almost medically pure stuff. You have never done Cocaine, until you tried ours!<br /><br />During the beginning, we offer .5g and 1g as well as pulverized coca leaves (hard to get here), from which one can make an excellent tea.<br /><br />Once we have gotten a good reputation, we will offer larger amount and we will offer shipments from our second lab in South America. While the prices from Germany are high, the prices when ordering from South America will be around 25$ a gram (uninsured, i.e. FE and no refund) and around 45$ including full insurance (refund or reship).<br /><br />We aim to bring a product of extreme quality to you for a decent price. The Cocaine is always between 91% and 98% pure and has no other alcoloids (no speedy comedown).<br /><br />We will start to accept offers now for reduced prices. However, our first batch is still drying and will be shipped Sunday/Monday.<br /><br />Once you have tried our product, you will know what cocaine actually is and you will not go back to any other supplier.<br /><br />We are all chemicists. We know what we are doing :-)<br /><br />Please visit my vendor page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/366529fdc9

				Oh and you should put a link to your vendor page in your forum &quot;signature&quot; so every time you post people can follow it to your page.<br /><br />
