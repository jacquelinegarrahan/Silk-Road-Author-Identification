				Hi everyone,<br />tell me please -&nbsp; there are 2 indicators, which shows quality of sellers work:<br /><br />1-100 % feedback score and <br />sellers rank.<br /><br />What is more important? <br />For example, if i read next&nbsp; about seller - <br />ranked in the top 2% of sellers with 93.2% positive feedback from ....<br />which indicator in this case is more important?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank&#039;s

				Hard to say.<br /><br />But cant you be betrayed anyway, if a seller allows Escrow? So for me this would be more indicator of trust, as the feedback which could be faked anyway. Maybe if they make transactions with their friends.<br /><br />I wanne sell MJ btw. interested? Shipped from Spain. I want to have some pre-orders before I open up a vendor account, since it needs a quite huge pre-investment. The fee (appropriate packing material, etc.

				The feedback ranking is how a vendor has been rated by buyers when they leave feedback.<br /><br />The percentile ranking evenly distributes all SR vendors across a 1-100% range depending on a number of different factors. Essentially it tells you who is doing the most business.<br /><br /><br /><br />You could have a small time vendor with low volume, but very happy customers. They may have a 100 next to their name but only be ranked in the top 50%.<br /><br />A large vendor doing tons of business may be in the top 1% but less customer satisfaction, only earning a feedback ranking of 90.<br /><br /><br /><br />I would advise you to put more weight on the feedback rating then the percentile ranking.

				I&#039;m always impressed if a vendor is able to keep a high feedback rating and is doing high volume however.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think scanning through feedback is a better method for deciding whether a vendor is worth a try. The percentile score is calculated via a pretty complex algorithm with a whole bunch of variables that can skew ranking. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For instance buyers with long history, great stats and heaps of coin spent effect the percentile score more than other buyers. So a vendor who has an almost perfect run, but then gets into a dispute with a solid buyer who gives the vendor a 1/5 will see the percentile rank drop quite a bit.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Then there&#039;s those scammy vendor fucks who, after building good rep, do a mass fe scam, which can take a while to reflect in percentile ranking, but is usually pretty quickly obvious in feedback.

				Useful to know. I had thought that the percentile was just based on the feedback score in relation to all the other vendors. I see that it&#039;s more complicated than that.

				Buying in SR can be pretty straight forward but can turn into a hideous ordeal-like going to the DMV or the dentist.<br />We must always keep in mind that a DRUG DEALER IS A DRUG DEALER IS A DRUG DEALER.<br />Just placed my first order here with a trusted vendor.If it arrives all is ok , if not , who&#039;s fault is it ?Did the vendor actually sent it? Was it intercepted by customs?Was it lost by the Royal Mail?<br />There is no simple answer.

				I am talking from personal experience.I am an addict.20 years now and very few decent people out of the hundreds I ve came across.Maybe I was unlucky or I didnt command respect..Who knows?<br />But harsch?I thing not-but we the addicts are a very difficult bunch of people to deal with.So dealers must be a certain type of people.<br />As everything else in this life there are the good and the bad.I like SR because much of the bull you have to take when doing business face2face here is virtually non existent.But even here people bring with them all the flaws they pick up from the street-some because it was the only way to survive others because they liked it.I have seen dealers behaving so sadisticaly that it reminded me things I heard about concentration camps in WWII.I have no idea the people that you came in contact with but my experience so far-FROM THE STREET NOT FROM SR-left me with a very poor taste in my mouth ,and propably a lot of anger.I am no saint myself so who am I to judge.I hope I havent offended you or anyone else.The people here are real professionals.I hope that they will restore my faith and gain my trust. <br />NOBIS SOLUM HONOR MAMET...I live by these words.<br />
