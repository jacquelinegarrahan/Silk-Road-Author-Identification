				I have had 3 things sent to my house since June 8th. I have another coming in a day or two. I want to get a fifth one by Saturday or Monday.<br /><br />How often is too often? When does it get suspicious?

				Well depending on where you live you should be fine with 1-2 a week as long as it blends in with the regular mail <br />Me personally I would only have 1 a week max per drop <br />And I would also buy parcels that wernt SR related when I wasn&#039;t expecting anything delivered for a while

				Yeah, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything suspicious about that amount. Maybe you got into jewelry-making as a hobby and are ordering rare beads from all over the country. Who cares? The post office sees all kinds of weird shit. As long as it&#039;s securely packaged, it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				i wouldnt worry about it.. i literally have at least 1 package per day show up at my house (not SR related...) but the post office sees this all the time... nearly everyday..&nbsp; making numerous deliveries to a house in a given week they dont even give it a second thought...

				This is also the last time I&#039;ll ever be at this address, I&#039;m moving from an address where I can receive packages to an address where I can&#039;t. Think that changes anything?

				i would not be concerned in the least...things are shipped constantly through Amazon and other online stores, 5-10 packages in a row is not suspicious in the least.&nbsp; If you had 20-30 shipments coming in on a daily basis, then maybe it would be cause of concern.

				yeah - so long as the packaging is good and is not likely to raise eyebrows then no problem - I don&#039;t think the post people really care that much so long as it isn&#039;t really obvious - there was a postal guy on the forums this week saying basically if the package doesn&#039;t say actually say &quot;drugs&quot; all over it or stinks like skunk then no one gives a shit!

				As long as you aren&#039;t getting deliveries which might attract attention - such as ounces of weed - there should be no problem. <br /><br />Like some above have mentioned, I do a lot of buying on eBay and get loads of strange looking packages of various sizes and I also buy a lot of things from China - and some of the packages that come from companies over there look really bizarre. <br /><br />From what I have read and heard, it is mainly international deliveries from places like the Netherlands that might arouse suspicion on their own.

				I personally don&#039;t get any drugs etc sent to my home address but to be honest I don&#039;t think the Mail would ever think you receiving packages to your property would be suspicious. I order DVD&#039;s and clothes in bulk from play.com and regularly there will be 40 small white parcels coming through my door once a month or so, the postman does look pissed off but two years of doing this and have never been reported.

				I guess it depends upon patterns.&nbsp; I order a lot of things online, so having a package waiting for me where I live is nothing unusual.&nbsp; As long as the person on the other end is using good stealth, then there should be no worries.

				Don&#039;t sweat it, most people get more than one item a week in their mailbox, receiving 3 or 4 is definitely not suss at all.

				I&#039;ve been ordering oddbaal crap from Amazon, eBay, dealextreme, etc for years. Any small, non-descript package would cause little suspicion... even if I was receiving it 3-4 times a week.<br /><br />I probably depends on your previous habits... but for all anyone knows you&#039;re trying to complete your Pink Floyd CD collection. Don&#039;t sweat it.
