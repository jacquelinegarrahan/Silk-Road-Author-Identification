				I noticed Litecoin a few weeks back, and have already read opinions of it being forecasted to become to BTC what Silver is to Gold.<br /><br />I was gonna buy about a grands worth of them as just see what happens over the coming months to the next couple of years, I have a feeling that if BTC becomes more accepted into the mainstreams of society then it will also become traceable.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a professional, but that&#039;s just what I believe will happen eventually.<br />Which means goodbye where this site and BMR are concerned among others.<br /><br />What do you guys make of it?

				My opinion is at this point, when they&#039;re as cheap as they are It&#039;s basically a no brainer to invest 100 or so dollars in them.

				I don&#039;t know a great deal about Litecoins, but from what Ive read there seems to be no clear advantages that LTC has over BTC.&nbsp; If this is the case I don&#039;t see any reasons that LTC would be worth the risk. With btc becoming more known, there are more and more ways being developed to spend them on useful items, which is making their value skyrocket. With ltc lack of options to spend or trade for other items of value I don&#039;t see the value in them.

				I guess it doesn&#039;t hurt to cautiously invest in LTC, but I wouldn&#039;t expect the same turn around for BTC. JMO.

				I agree, it is a very smart investment. I put a sum into LTC as well as PPC TRC NMC...<br /><br />Just sayin to those of you who could&#039;ve bought BTC a month ago when it was at $40 <br />Dont start complaining when LTC inevitably starts trading on major currency exchanges online<br />and its hits $25usd. You all are being given a second chance to cash in on cheap crypto-currency<br />before it gets to the point where its too expensive and people can no longer afford a single coin<br />so if you don&#039;t take this second chance dont expect a third. Buy as much LTC and BTC as you can<br />over the next few weeks/months/years you wont be sorry!

				I bought about 4k worth at $2 something. I think once Mt Gox starts trading in them the price will skyrocket...

				My feeling is that there may be a scam going on with them. People promoting them often sound like they are scamming to me. I probably also thought this about Btc at first though. I think they will be great at first, better than Btc for value rise. Then I think they may well become valueless or be found to be a tracking method for LE or something. Hopefully I&#039;m just way too paranoid. But lets say you have 10k worth, can you spend them anywhere if speculators stop buying? I don&#039;t really know much about &#039;em or if they can be spent. I just get a sketchy feeling off the Ltc vibe. Buy soon and sell soon might be a great thing though.

Gox has never made a statement to this effect, and I doubt it&#039;s something that they would do. They already have a hard enough time sustaining the load of BTC trading.<br /><br />The only place this has been actually claimed is in a scam link that&#039;s been going around in a lot of Bitcoin-related chats which links to a Mt. Gox phishing site.<br /><br />I&#039;m on the fence about LTC myself. I haven&#039;t bought any.

				Gox announced today in a Reddit AMA that they will be introducing &quot;alternate crypto currencies&quot; within the next week or two. Their public API stream indicates LTC and NMC will both be added whenever they do the big release. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about LTC, but I just started mining it today. I noticed that on BTC-e the price fluctuates upwards quite often. We&#039;ll see what happens.
