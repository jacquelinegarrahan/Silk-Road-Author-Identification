				I&#039;m leaving for Florida in the morning and I really wanted to have 4-aco-dmt, 4-ho-met, and lsb for while I&#039;m there. Unfortunately these probably won&#039;t come in for another day or two. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal though, in a few days my sister will be staying at the house they&#039;re getting shipped to and then flying to Florida to meet us. I want to ask her to put the letter in her luggage, it should only be one normal sized and normal looking envelope since he shipped it all together. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve been thinking, and I&#039;m worried that it might somehow look suspicious and get opened by security if they go through her luggage. I might just be paranoid but with how airport security is these days I doubt it. I might just have my mail forwarded to the house we&#039;re staying at in Florida. <br /><br />So what are your thoughts, is it a stupid idea? <br />Should I just have it forwarded to Florida? I don&#039;t know how to do that yet but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not too difficult. <br />I definitely don&#039;t want to put my family at any sort of risk, so if any of you see a problem with it please let me know. <br /><br />Thank you!

				what form are they? (white powder)? And how much quantity? If so I would worry about them thinking its anthrax or something... I would find out the TSA procedures for screening luggage and would base my decision off that, but most likely your safest bet would be to just have it forwarded. Not worth the risk or paranoia imo

				well I would imagine they would still need a warrant to open the letter, and it sounds like, in reality, what you&#039;re doing is normal. you&#039;re just having mail brought to you essentially. i personally wouldn&#039;t do it, but I can be really paranoid. if i were to bring drugs on a plane like that I would put them in capsules and in an empty vitamin bottle. I hope somebody can clarify for you though, but even with TSA being federal agents, I do believe they would need a warrant from a judge to open mail. unless there&#039;s some terrorist clause about unopened packages, and also, if it were to be x rayed what would it look like? it might raise red flags, but i&#039;m just speculating here

				Thanks for the responses guys. The first two will be in powder form and the LSB is on blotter. My sister can&#039;t know what&#039;s in them though, so in the letter is the only way she could bring them. I&#039;ve decided it&#039;s not worth the risk though. I would never forgive myself if my sister got in legal trouble because of me. I&#039;ll just have it forwarded. Thanks again for the quick response.

				Just have it forwarded. The TSA basically has a blank check to sidestep the 4th Amendment, so if they decide that they want to know what&#039;s inside your mail, your sister is fucked (and probably you, too, by extension).<br /><br />As a side note, even if it were perfectly safe, I hope that you would tell your sister that she&#039;s carrying drugs and not just bringing you your mail. That sort of thing is pretty important to know.

I feel silly for even considering it now.

				I would consider having her take it out of the envelope and putting in a pocket of some clothes or something.&nbsp; Unopened mail looks a tad suspicious when traveling, especially if it&#039;s not addressed to the person carrying it.&nbsp; If she has a choice of carry on or checking luggage, I would opt to say checking would be safer, but has a higher chance of getting lost.&nbsp; Just my two cents - have a phun TRIP :)

				I think you are seriously considering having your sister unknowingly mule you drugs via air, and your not sure if you&#039;re a good or bad person and came here for some reassurance.<br />Do not do that without ASKING her first. You can&#039;t just have her think she&#039;s bringing you mail when shes really carrying drugs through an airport without knowing it so you can have the acid &quot;you really wanted&quot;. Rather selfish if you ask me. Ask her first.

It didn&#039;t dawn on me how dumb it was until I realized she was flying and not driving like the rest of our family. I more or less came here to see if anyone had knowledge on how security checks luggage and just how risky it would be. I decided to have it forwarded not to long after clicking the post button. I couldn&#039;t ever put my family in that kind of a risk with a clean conscious. I have drugs mailed to our house, yes, but I trust the stealth of the vendors here and psychedelics aren&#039;t too hard to conceal. I&#039;ll have a house of my own in a few months anyhow. I probably won&#039;t be making too many orders until then.

				Put it in the luggage. Everything you take with you directly on the plane is checked by x-ray, but not all of the luggage. Depending which airport and country you´re coming from, even nothing of the luggage could be checked.<br />

				Guys I get it :&#039;( I&#039;ve already pointed out that it was a selfish thought. It was. I could not live with myself if she were to get in trouble. Regardless, by the time I posted this, I wasn&#039;t going to have her take it on the plane. I was just wondering what the community had to say about it. I didn&#039;t realize how ridiculously stupid and selfish the premise sounded though. Yes, the thought passed through my head, but when the thought of consequences came to me I ditched the idea. I have high quality acid, galindoi&#039;s mushrooms, and a small amount of DMT that I&#039;m already taking with me. It would be absolutely pointless for me to put her at risk. Even if I didn&#039;t have these things I wouldn&#039;t risk it, because even if she made it through okay I would feel like piece of shit. And then the psychedelics would be pointless. They would just make me think of how shitty of a brother I am. I agree, it was fucked up to have the thought in the first place and now I&#039;m bummed out. All I want to do is love but my reputation here is already going down the drain :(

				It could probably be done, but it&#039;s just not worth it. Just have her mail it to you. The TSA are not the people you want your sister having to deal with. For $50 bucks she can overnight it to you. It&#039;s worth the $50 to avoid the risk no matter how small it may be.
