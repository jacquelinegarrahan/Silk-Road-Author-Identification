				It depends. If you&#039;re only an occasional buyer, and if losing that money wouldn&#039;t be a big deal, it&#039;s likely fine (and might even be safer / less incriminating) to just use an online option. If, on the other hand, you&#039;re a full-time vendor receiving the bulk of your income in BTC, you definitely need to secure your wallet(s) yourself. <br /><br />(And this should go without saying, but if you&#039;re involved with SR and using a downloaded wallet, please make sure to run it through Tor.)

				I order 1-2 times a month. Well on order day, I get a new btc address from my SR account. Copy it, then paste it on the BitInstant form. <br />(I use the&nbsp; &quot;pay to ฿TC to address&quot; feature)<br />Go down to Walmart, with my Moneygram already filled out, hand over the cash, get my receipt, and I&#039;ve got&nbsp; ฿tc in my account sometimes in less than a half hour! <br /><br />I have some offline wallets here and there. I went through all the growing pains and mistakes over a year ago. Thought Mt. Gox was the authority on&nbsp; ฿TC&#039;s. (wrong- in fact a waste of time and money-also they tend to be ever so cooperative with LE so forget Mt. Gox)<br /><br />Bitstamp does work well. Also I&#039;ve used https://blockchain.info/wallet/ when I felt the site was a little shaky, but usually, I get my ฿TC&#039;s in there, and I&#039;ve already picked out what I wanted. Usually in my cart already, so I just &quot;BUY&quot; and that is that. <br /><br />Over 80 transactions and thousands of dollars later. - No problems! 8)<br /><br />SoALone
