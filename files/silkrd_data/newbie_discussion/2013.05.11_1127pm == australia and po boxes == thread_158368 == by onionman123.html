				There is a lot of discussion about this.&nbsp; From what I have seen AUS is a difficult country to get goods sent to.&nbsp; I would not recommend taking a shipment from the Netherlands if you are in Australia.&nbsp; Whatever you are trying to get, there are many of vendors across the EU and US that are willing to supply you.&nbsp; I say take Netherlands as a last resort, and even then only take it when the vendor has a good reputation for getting past customs.&nbsp; Remember, too good of a reputation could mean they&#039;ve been doing too good for too long... which may not be a good thing either!

				Yeah ok thanks, do you no what will happen if the package is intercepted? will they just seize it? or will they come knocking on my door even though its a PO box? So there is less chance of getting caught when shipping from us and eu? Ive found a very good vendor from the netherlands and is exactly what im after. Thankyou for reply..

				Mate don&#039;t order international&nbsp; it to your home address or PO box in your name. If it gets intercepted then it could compromise you for domestic orders if you want to get that sent to your home (domestic is a lot less risk). Will they come knocking? depends on what it is and the quantity.

				Have to agree with worm11. If your order never arrives you&#039;ll sweat everytime there&#039;s a knock at your front door, not to mention compromising yourself for domestic orders. And as you say to open PO box they&#039;ll have your ID anyway. Also I&#039;ve heard a number of Aussies who say order from Netherlands scrutinized.

				Not sure how Customs work but international letters/packages will show country of origin. Netherlands is a well known source of drugs.

				I&#039;ve personally sent LSD blotters to an Australian friend who has an PO box. <br />I&#039;m in the UK though, dunno if that makes a difference. Probably. Compared to something coming from NL, for example. <br /><br />He&#039;s received all his gifts though. About 6 at the last count. But then, LSD is easy peasy to conceal.

Another option is to find a drop, it&#039;s more of a hassle finding an empty house with accessible mail box, send a few letters as a test. Its time consuming and increases the risk of not receiving but you never worry about a knock at the front door, and with the much cheaper cost of Int product you can afford to lose a few.

				I did hear some things about sending to Oz. Roughly 2 years ago a group of people were sending to Oz. The substance was ground to a powder and sealed. Some of the addresses were po boxes, others were houses. The story goes that the Boxes were with fake names through a dirty employee. As for beating customs, I&#039;m not sure what your operation is like but this was what I call an acceptable loss zerg. By that I mean that each 1kg of substance was broken up into many smaller packages. They were sent regular mail. Enough arrived that it was worth the losses as the cost &quot;here&quot; vs the cost &quot;there&quot; was enough to make up for what didn&#039;t arrive.&nbsp; This was a fairly large operation though but it functioned with a good deal of profit for quite some time. In fact if personal greed hadn&#039;t entered into it, it may still be going.&nbsp; From my understanding there was very little security/safety for the people on the other end. Then again, anyone receiving a package faces similar risk I suppose.

Ordering from the Netherlands, especially in amounts of that size, is crazy these days. It&#039;s a known world wide drug hot spot and packages face extra scrutiny from countries such as the NL. If you believe the &quot;anyone can send anything&quot; theory will get you off the hook, you&#039;re in for a rude shock and a dose of reality.<br />To suggest you&#039;re more worried about mum and dad knowing a package has arrived from O/S (could be from eBay for all they know) than going to jail for a considerable length of time is laughable. That&#039;s just ridiculous!! Naive in the extreme and an immature attitude towards the potential consequences of your actions if your caught. Sounds like a ticking time bomb to me.

				I suggest you put a false name on the package just so if it does get caught you can always fall back on &#039;thats not my name&#039;. But however supertrips is a solid importer for australia with fantastic stealth methods.
