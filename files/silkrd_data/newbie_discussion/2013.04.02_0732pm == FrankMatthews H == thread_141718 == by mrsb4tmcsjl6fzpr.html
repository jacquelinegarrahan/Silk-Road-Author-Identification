				Interesting... could you direct me to a topic where it suggests his H is no good? I can only seem to find good feedback.. reason why I ordered.

				Doesn&#039;t FM only do FE? His listings are by far the most prominent when I look at the opiods category.

				Yes he only does FE, I don&#039;t mind because he seems to be one of the best vendors on SR... but I am now wondering if shipping from NL to CAD is safe?

				Not sure what your Customs are like with Dutch post?<br /><br />Considering how much business FM seems to do,I don&#039;t read much about him on the forums. I&#039;d like to see some recent reviews.

				Do yourself a favour and try a half g of OPI pebbles. Yes it&#039;s expensive but it&#039;s probably 70-75%. You won&#039;t regret it. Laplace

				I&#039;d point you to the thousand odd page Heroin vendors thread! :o<br />go back half a dozen pages&nbsp; ...plus there are 2 seperate heroin threads, ones only 15-20pages long, it&#039;s the &#039;new one&#039; ;)

				^ What this guy said. Read the OP of the Heroin thread in the Rumor Mill, and see what vendors people are talking about on the later pages. A little bit of research will probably go a long way toward getting good gear from reliable people.

				I realise this is a old thread but wanted<br />To chime in quick, I have placed 5 orders now from frankMatthews to southern Ontario Canada. The first 4 came though fine other then a slight package problem where some was lost. The speed was amazing the fastest being Thursday to Monday average was about 5 days in total. <br />I just ordered the fifth time, a gram of #3 but after 12 days it hasn&#039;t shown up. Frank has agreed to send one reship so fingers crossed I&#039;ll get it in a few days. <br />Overall I&#039;m happy with frank and his service and as long as I get this reship I&#039;ll continue to order off him
