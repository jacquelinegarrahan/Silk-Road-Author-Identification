				Can anyone recommend me some decent reading on drugs, preferably psychedelics.&nbsp; My mate lent me The Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs and my other mates been reading DMT -&nbsp; The Spiritual Molecule which he says is really interesting so I might try and get that off him.<br /><br />Cheers

				The Psychedelic Experience, co-authored by Timothy Leary, is pretty good. It&#039;s a guide to working through psychedelic experiences. It was written back in the 60s. Too bad people aren&#039;t writing books like that today!

				Shulgin&#039;s PiHKAL and TiHKAL are both fantastic books written by the man who synthesized many different psychoactive chemicals and even tested them on himself. They&#039;re wonderful reads, and even throw in some of the chemistry behind his synthesis

				Doors of Perception is 100% worthwhile. Incredible imagery, brilliant guy.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick didn&#039;t do drugs or really write about drugs much but that&#039;s good drug literature nonetheless!<br /><br />William Burroughs is probably the best - his writing is mind-expanding even for straight folks who don&#039;t do drugs. Here&#039;s a fun, narrative, creepy-awesome introduction that everyone should read (clearnet):<br />www.ccru.net/archive/burroughs.htm <br /><br />

				LSD - MY PROBLEM CHILD<br />By Albert Hofmann<br /><br />Trust me, it goes very detailed on psychedelics as different psilocybin and lsd.<br />Goes a little too scientific sometimes for me, but you can skip it if you want.<br /><br />Even a good trip report my Albert himself!
