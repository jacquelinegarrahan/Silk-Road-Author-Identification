				I recently stumbled upon SR and I told a friend of mine who has more of an appetite for such things (I only use SR for personal green and some hash...once in a while shrooms.) We live in a small-town, paranoid cop area... he wants to use SR to hook others up with LSD and what not... I&#039;m afraid if he gets popped for something like that he may say &quot;so and so told me about this...&quot; <br /><br />This is just high-paranoid thought probably...just curious if I would technically be at any risk of getting into trouble. Thanks guys!

				Unfortunately, there was another friend there too. He has no internet and what not... I don&#039;t think he would be someone that would do any testifying or anything. I&#039;m naturally paranoid (that&#039;s why I&#039;d prefer a delivery to my house than driving with something illegal,) and I was just wanting to help a friend out who might get more use out of it than I would. I&#039;m sort of freaking out about it. Maybe I shouldn&#039;t...

				You&#039;ll have to get a reply from someone with a bit more legal knowledge than me for a difinitive answer, but I would try to forget about it. Might be easier said than done if you&#039;re always paranoid I guess.<br /><br />All vendors I&#039;ve dealth with so far are pretty damn good with stealth packaging, and domestic buying is almost failsafe =)<br /><br />Also remember that its a lot easier for your friend to say &quot;I typed &quot;how to buy drugs online&quot; in google and found SR&quot;. The Silk Road has had alot of online news coverage and is not hard to find instructions on how to get here with a few searches.<br /><br />Hope this helps calm you down a bit, if not.. hit a bong&nbsp; :)<br /><br />-S

				I don&#039;t get it...<br />Are you worried that there is some law that you broke by simply telling someone about SR? I don&#039;t know how that could be since it&#039;s not illegal to log onto, and browse SR.<br /><br />Or are you just worried that he&#039;s going to rat you out as a SR user who buys, etc.?

				Yeah, I smoke too much that&#039;s why I&#039;m paranoid...just a little concerned my friend would be a bitch with a big acid charge in front of him and say Jasper showed me a site where I can get anything I want and perhaps hip them to the fact that I order to (never anything over a half OZ of green or a quarter of mush or a gram of hash)... I don&#039;t know why they would waste resources on me, unless they suspected me of being part of a big ring.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how they would pin it on me if so. I mean, its not like I was placing orders for him or delivering him his orders I just showed him the website and how to get bitcoins...<br /><br />Thanks for any advice. I feel a bit more at ease.<br /><br />

				Not knocking you down or anything, but my rule of thumb for friends that don&#039;t know about SR or how to access.. Don&#039;t tell them. Just get them the gear they are looking for and be done.<br /><br />SR is already known by too many undeserving people as it is.. <br /><br />and by undeserving I mean, the scammers, haters, or anyone that does not have good intentions.. <br /><br />(im stoned.. sorry)

				Yeah I understand. I basically felt there were friends that could get more use than I. I don&#039;t really hook my friends up with anything. I am broke and rarely take stuff out of my house, ha. I wouldn&#039;t be worried if they were just using it for personal, but they are somewhat known in the area and may use it to deal. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be fucking paranoid if he&#039;s going to get in trouble or whatever you know? I&#039;d rather just let him make his own decisions and if he gets in trouble...so be it. I&#039;m just curious if there would be any case for me by showing him where to access this material.

				It&#039;s not illegal, just ill-advised. The less people who know about your use of SR the better. Just tell people you have a connection and never go into more detail. SR is on the downlow and personal use of it is just about the safest way to buy everything. Humans are a constant source of bust information which is why you should minimize your drug interactions with them.

				Ok. At first I thought SR was a scam or just too good to be true (like many others I am sure.) So I told a couple friends on top of the one I am speaking of;those friends I confirmed that it was indeed a scam site and that I would never be messing with it. They never thought anymore about it. Now, the other friend... he has the potential to be an idiot and the potential to be very intelligent. I guess I will consider this just a paranoid moment in the life of online scoring.<br /><br />From now on, I am going to pretend like I&#039;m not down with the SR in my area. I realize my first steps after finding the site were guided by ignorance..

				You&#039;re fine. Did you encourage, entice or promote a felony beyond a reasonable double? Basically, were you cheering on this person as they made a purchase while videotaped? What happens after SR could be a concern ... if they plan to re-sell, I wouldn&#039;t be anywhere near them or their stash. Even if you do chill at a stash house this is a pretty weak case. <br /><br />The real case is after the purchase and any mistakes made along the way that compromise your friend&#039;s anonymity. I am going through a situation with a friend at the moment, and your situation seems well before the stage of becoming an &quot;accomplice&quot; and well out of the reach of &quot;conspiracy&quot;. <br /><br />Also, just go ahead and tell your friend to not make any purchases (if you are SUPER PARANOID like myself) ... if you can get someone to back up your legitimate efforts to halt a felony, it will help mitigate any conceivable involvement on your end. Again, being part of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; or being an &quot;accomplice&quot; prior to the transaction are really the only concerns, and they are really hard to prosecute and I wouldn&#039;t be worried in the slightest. My two cents ... don&#039;t worry or even bother with this. If you can (although I know it hard ... I have been there so many fucking times) disassociate yourself with these guys. It is the ultimate protection.

				Yeah, what you&#039;re saying makes total sense. I told him about the site, showed him the process, told him it was for educational purposes only (jokingly), and wasn&#039;t involved with his transaction (he ordered 25x 25i). I did help him through the bitcoin process via text, but that is legal. I am probably reading too much into it. He may be less likely to mention me than I would imagine too. Who knows?<br /><br />I guess I will just wait around and see if he gets into some trouble by being an idiot. If he does, I will quit SR and clean up around the house... even if that is being paranoid. It seems weird to be charged with simply showing someone how to access a site and the process of obtaining bitcoins. I am a little less high than I was earlier... I feel a bit better. Until tomorrow! Ha!

				No, it&#039;s not illegal to show someone SR.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t be arrested and tried for it (well, distribution or something).<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not a bad idea.&nbsp; It could make people suspicious, and their suspicion might uncover things that can actually be brought against you.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a lawyer - if you&#039;re genuinely worried go talk to one.

				Oh I love law I used to want to be a defense attorney. Number one loose lips sink ships personally I don&#039;t tell anyone about SR no one why would you? I consider it need to know and people just don&#039;t need to know anymore then what they need to know.<br /><br />The more others know, the more people know, the more likely you are to having a problem its that simple. If in the circumstance I&#039;m good friends with you (trust you).&nbsp; I still never say exactly where I got it I just say from my source.<br /><br />No details, no names, no locations. Its the people that run their mouths brag, tell other people, and talk about these details that are almost always the ones that have the trouble in most circumstances. <br /><br />Tell no one its your business period.

				Ok, so I think I got it from what you all are saying:<br /><br />A. I&#039;m a dumbass for showing anyone the website and how to work it. (I know, I know... like many others, I didn&#039;t think it was legit. When I found that it was, I realized what a mistake I made.<br /><br />B. If my friend did get in trouble for dealing acid that he purchased from the SR and gave me up as the person who showed him SR, I would be in no trouble because I technically didn&#039;t do anything illegal. I simply pointed him to a site where you can see that illegal things are sold. Anything after that was his decision and had nothing to do with me.<br /><br />C. If I continue to open my mouth about SR, my buying would be in jeopardy (even though I order the smallest amounts and would never deal or even give anyone my stuff.) <br /><br />Does that all seem right?

				Your not a dumb ass your gonna make mistakes like all of us that our newbies just learn from them. Best bet only tell others the bare minimum of what they need to know or in this case nothing when it comes to that part of your life. The simple fact is man no good can come from it. <br /><br />Most of all don&#039;t beat yourself up for making mistakes its not the end of the world just don&#039;t do it again.If others or your friends want to know about SR&nbsp; they can do the work and find it themselves just like you did.

				Without disclosing my education or profession, I can say that telling someone about the road is not a crime.&nbsp; It is protected by the 1st amendment as long as the knowledge was not in furtherance of a crime.&nbsp; The doctrine/law that would be violated would be &quot;conspiracy.&quot;<br /><br />So legal:&nbsp; &quot;Hey, I know about this cool site where you can buy drugs.&quot;<br /><br />Illegal. &quot;Hey, I&#039;ll tell you about a site where we can buy drugs, and then we can start a partnership to distribute said drugs for profit.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Most likely, you have have to take some steps TOWARD the illegal enterprise before any charges would come.

				&quot;People like this&quot; MrChronicFlame is so superior and intelligent. Thanks for all your great insight dude... <br /><br />Anyway, thanks to the people to ease my mind. Lesson learned... no speaking to anyone about this website anymore and the ones that do know, I will make it seem like its a scam. Problem is: the person I&#039;m afraid will abuse the site and get scared by the threat of jail that he may say that I am the reason he knows where to find his stuff to sell, knows that this is legitimate. I did speak to a lawyer today and he said that it is all good. That I am able to show him the site if I am not aware of any plans he had to deal and what not, which I didn&#039;t. I was simply showing him a website for his own knowledge...something he could make use for if he was willing to do things on his own, which he does. Anyway, thanks a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hi Jasper800,<br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat for a second that showing someone SR is a legal issue, considering it&#039;s been in many newspapers, many TV slots, all over the internet in various articles, and it is public knowledge in the public domain. Even&nbsp; US Senators are on Youtube viewing it (just after the infamous Gawker article).<br /><br />Not the best idea to do, but we all make mistakes. Your potential problems are in Real Life, if you are in a small paranoid town and you think your friend is going to start spreading drugs around that will come to the law&#039;s attention. If you are associated with him, and LE crack down, they might come to you.<br /><br />You need to be aware and keep your house and your computer clean and learn from the posts on the forum how to disguise your tracks. <br /><br />SR is out in the open, no big deal, but you imply you&#039;re friend might get a bit flaky. We&#039;ve all had crazy cousins. Avoid.<br /><br />Take care.

				Jasper, I&#039;m sure you will be fine. Just be careful in the meantime. If your friend burns you, just deny. 5th amendment right to silence and 6th amendment right to lawyer. I can&#039;t think of any &quot;proof&quot; you mentioned that could harm you in court.<br /><br />*Disclaimer - I am not a lawyer.
