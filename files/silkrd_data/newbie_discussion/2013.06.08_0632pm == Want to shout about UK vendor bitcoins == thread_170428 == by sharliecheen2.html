				I&#039;ve used this guy twice now, swapping posted cash for bitcoin to my SR wallet. Both times were great transactions.<br /><br />In both cases, I made my order late at night and had a reply by morning. The guy transfers the BTC within a couple of hours of the cash hitting his doormat, so the entire transaction is complete within 48 hours.<br /><br />The second time, I received the wrong amount due to sudden changes in the exchange rate. I messaged the guy and he again replied within a few hours, over-compensating for the error. In other words, my worst experience with this vendor consists of getting more BTC than expected, and still within 48 hours of initial purchase on SR.<br /><br />There&#039;s been lots of discussion about MtGox&#039;s new rules, and maybe that&#039;s what&#039;s driving the recent drop in BTC value. Lots of newcomers are asking how to get BTC. Buying for cash simply removes anonymity worries. Before &quot;bitcoins&quot;, I used another SR vendor providing an identical service. There is not a single bitcoin yet which can be linked to my IRL self, even though I&#039;ve used lots of them to buy a lot of drugs. I don&#039;t worry about tumblers, shifting BTC through multiple wallets, fake ID scans or any of that. There is no simpler or less exposing way to go from money to BTC on SR.<br /><br />Having to change money for bitcoin as a prerequisite for using Silk Road, is probably a substantial block to the market&#039;s adoption. It&#039;s certainly a hurdle for newcomers. The easier we can make this transition the better, for both vendors and buyers. Good BTC traders like &quot;bitcoins&quot; improve the health of the whole market.
