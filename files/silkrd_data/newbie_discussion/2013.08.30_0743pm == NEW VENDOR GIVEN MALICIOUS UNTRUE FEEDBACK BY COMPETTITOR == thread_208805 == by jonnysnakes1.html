				Yeah. I&#039;ve heard of it happening, and it&#039;s really sleazy because they know when you&#039;re new that your feedbacks actually hurt. Vendors with 1,000s of feedback don&#039;t get hurt like that since they&#039;re already established. Keep vending and put under your discussion that they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about and you should still get customers if you advertise your mephedrone lower priced because you&#039;re a new vendor. Go to the forum and offer samples to people willing to write a review and post the review and the links to your thread on your vendor page. It&#039;s possible to beat this fairly easily.

				What are you selling? Do you have any small/cheap samples? I&#039;m looking to try some new stuff, mostly pyschs but I&#039;m also looking for a wax/shatter and coke vendor. If you&#039;re domestic US let me know, I&#039;ll write a good review and hit you with some positive feedback. Keep in mind, I&#039;m not looking for free drugs, just cheaper samplers. I&#039;m always left with random BTC in my account after making purchases.

				Both sellers and buyers need to read between the lines sometimes... Once great vendors may collapse in a sudden flurry of FE&#039;s and new vendors get whacked around before they even have a chance to make their case.&nbsp; There&#039;s a measure of trust for buyers, too, of course - do you risk hanging your funds in escrow for weeks with a deadbeat?&nbsp; Is it a troll or a newb or something worse?<br /><br />Best of luck to you.&nbsp; I&#039;ll certainly be checking out your store.

				It&#039;s tough because you&#039;re new yourself, so you can&#039;t exactly implement buyer requirements.<br /><br />However, you always have the right to decline a sale.&nbsp; If a buyer has a bunch of small sales from only one vendor, it&#039;s likely a puppet account.&nbsp; Not always, but likely.<br /><br />A good presence on the forums is also a plus.&nbsp; As long as you respond to false allegations with a professional manner, and not engage in &quot;flame wars&quot;, you should be okay.<br /><br />ie. don&#039;t feed the trolls.

				When reading some of the feedback (both positive and negative) I am concerned at what is written and how it is written.&nbsp; Likely the best way to improve that system (trash in trash out) is that you don&#039;t write feedback when you are trashed.&nbsp; Then you can clearly see that lots of feedback is fully worthless.

				It really sucks donkey balls, but I suppose in this game (right or wrong) then many different ungentlemanly actions take place.<br /><br />The trick is to rise above it (like you seem to be doing very well) and get on with it.<br /><br />Peace.
