				Why do people even tolerate the sellers that demand you leave a 5/5 in order to receive your product?<br /><br />What kind of bullshit is this?

				Because if you&#039;re dealing with an established vendor, there is almost no situation where you would need to leave less than that. <br /><br />Some problems arise that are totally out of anyones control. Legit vendors recognize this and are typically more than willing to work with you to resolve the situation to your satisfaction. I&#039;ve never ran into the need to leave less than 5/5, and I don&#039;t expect to. These ratings greatly affect a vendor, and a few high users who are angry that a problem occurred and are unwilling to work toward resolution can quickly damage a vendors rating.

				Not necessarily. The crux of the situation is that there are SOME situations where a lower rating is warranted. These are few and far between, as legit vendors will bend over backwards to satisfy their customers. People get impatient, don&#039;t go through the proper resolution channels, don&#039;t communicate and then leave a rating that wrecks an otherwise flawless record. This isn&#039;t an accurate assessment of a vendor and creates an inaccurate appearance. <br /><br />You can leave a text comment along with the numerical rating, which can reflect that you had a problem but the vendor resolved it, which people do all the time when leaving 5/5. So, if going through reasonable procedures does not seem like something a person can bother themselves with, based on these comments you can choose to go through a different, less established vendor.

				Luckily I am a smart enough noob to read all recent feedback and reviews in the rumor mill but unfortunately I may have run into a bad transaction. It could turn out good in the end but i am getting worried. I ordered from TopGear. His feedback was perfect when I ordered ands there were no negative reviews. He was responsive to my messages and he even sent a message saying he was sending the product on Thursday. <br /><br />It is now Sunday and the order is still marked processing. I sent him a message on Friday regarding the&nbsp; order status not changing and then one late last night telling him to cancel the.order if he planned on shopping it Monday. Also some spotty feedback and reviews appeared right after I sent the order out. Ia am praying that he sent the order and was too busy to change the status and his lack of response is due to the fact that he tales the weekend off even though he was seen online after I sent my first message. <br /><br />Overall I didn&#039;t freak out and send him a ridiculous amount of messages and am hoping it will get resolved Monday with the arrival of the product or the cancellation of the orders.. I woildbhave gone with my first vendor Kush but he was on vacation. :(<br /><br /><br />EDIT: also I don&#039;t think anyone should demand a 5/5 review because no one is perfect and if their service happens to falter below that range for some reason we deserve the right to give them the proper score. A 3/5 and a 4/5 isn&#039;t bad feedback. And a 99 score isn&#039;t bad either. As long as the buyer takes a look at the whole picture. If we are forced to write 5/5 every time the buyers who don&#039;t take the time to look will simply see perfect reviews across the board for the nest and worst of the top vendors.

				Yeah there is definitely some amount of merit to this complaint. Rating isn&#039;t everything in the end, though. I have gotten shit product from vendors with 100% feedback, and gotten great service from vendors with low feedback. I feel like the feedback is more a reflection of their reliability in general. For example, I&#039;ve ordered bud from vendors that I didn&#039;t think was very good, but it looked pretty much like the picture and they had good shipping time and kept constant communication so in my opinion they still deserved a 5/5.

				Woild like to point to my last post and ask of anyone has comforting words for my vendor problem? Maybe past experience with the vendor even?<br /><br />As far as the whole 5/5 thing goes I am going to stand my ground and give vendors the rating they deserve. I will talk with then first to resolve the issue but if they think they can make me give a 5/5 rating without deserving it then I don&#039;t want the right to buy from them. 5/5 vendors should be able to give 5/5 service...always. as far as the scam buyer I imagine those issues can be resolved by sr support and cab easily be pointed out on the vendor page as well.

Its not worth the risk that the vendor demanding that isn&#039;t just showing off some kind of little dick syndrome. Like how guys who announce they have a big.dick really are just insecure about the small one they have compared to vendors who really can&#039;t always dish out 5/5 reviews have to announce that they deserve it. I guess it can he a good marketing ploy. Unless we are smart enough to not fall for it.

I will get screwed over if these get cancelled too because my 130 dollar purchase will turn into about 100 dollars. All I want is 117 dollars so I can purchase my third gram fro Kush411. Seriously if you are into meth you need to order from him when his listing come back up. I had a next day delivery and a two day delivery (express and priority respectively). I was nervous to go to someone else and this experience makes me want to hug kush leg and never let go. If the order does get cancelled hopefully btc spikes up to something good so I.can order from my man again. <br /><br />As far as your order I would get the money back if.you don&#039;t hear from the guy. If any vendors have a problem they should be reasonable once you explain your situation. If not they are assholes anyways. Lol. I have no tolerance for assholes who simply want to be unreasonable. I think talking xab solve everything. Get your btc back and wait for a jump so you can order something good. That&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna do. It could he risky but hopefully SD have another spike in value coming.

I hope everything works.out for you too. Unfortunately we are the buyers and we have to mold into whatever position the dealer wants. But the dealers can do whatever the hell they want and we can get fucked easily. Sr give us.more power than any.streetvmarket at least. <br /><br />As to trying meth I would advise you too try it.only if.you cab overcome.addictive drugs. Meth is an easy substance.to get addicted to and start to make an everyday thing. If you do try it I advise waiting for Kush411 to get back from vacation or.possibly try heroinusa who has food reviews with his 35 .5s and 65 gs. The .5 is your best bet considering the sloppiness of the.meth vendors lately.

				That depends on a few thing. I think I might take off a point due to the fact he told me he was shipping it Thursday and as of now it seems like he didn&#039;t. I will have to wait until I have a chat about that. If he sent it Thursday I should receive it Monday through priority shipping. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I will take a point off for communication because he was communicating very well at first. And he had to learn English for us non bilinguals.&nbsp; But he does have trouble reading messages when he was seen o line after the message has been sent. I&#039;m guessing that is due&nbsp; he amount of orders or&nbsp; messages though.<br /><br />I can judge the quality until I get it but that Is looking iffy at the moment. I&#039;m notsure if this batch is bad and some people were fooled by the looks but thereare three negative feed backs and one of them claims to have been tested by three individuals. That one is also backed up NY a very lengthy review. I guess all I can say is a 5/5 is still possible but not very probable. It may be as low as a 3/5 but hoping for my and his sake it can at least be a 4/5.<br /><br />EDIT: motek: there is much more to the order than the quality of the product.if the product is amazing it will normally get a 5/5 if the other aspects were OK but with this order some of the other aspects may fall short. Luckily it is all conjecture and the vendor still might pull through<br /><br />And I am very calm ;-p

				thanks motek :)<br /><br /><br />I think if I got it in the next few days I would give him 5/5...and then maybe mention in the feedback if you do still have communication issues.&nbsp; that&#039;s interesting that he had to learn english, if he is still new at it it&#039;s probably quite overwhelming to deal with the amount of messages he is getting!&nbsp; obviously if it is shit quality I would go back later and change that.&nbsp; for me I like to finalize pretty much as soon as I open the package &amp; make sure it looks good...if it ends up being shit quality later when I try it then I&#039;d go back and change the feedback for that. <br />He shouldn&#039;t have told you he would ship thurs &amp; then not actually mark it as in transit, but maybe something happened &amp; he just didnt get a chance to do that &amp; you will still get it monday.&nbsp; if not he will probably ship it monday since he def says he doesn&#039;t work on the weekend (which sucks for timing purposes, but helps cuz seems more likely he&#039;s not actively ignoring you if he is just not working). I have no idea of knowing for sure but I&#039;m thinking you are not getting screwed over here &amp; you will get your stuff at some point...that&#039;s my guess.<br /><br />FYI only looked at the first page of his feedback but the first two that are less than 5/5 are talking about his coke, so hoping for you the meth is good stuff

				I did forget about the fact two were for coke. I guess I just have to worry about the metg review in the thread in the rumor mill. That one scares me a little. <br /><br />I am iffy on whether or not he should lose a point because of the whole tellih me Thursday thing. I think if it turns out he actually didn&#039;t and doesn&#039;t have a good reason for not informing me he should lose a point for communication or shipping. The problem is even if a vendor doesn&#039;t have a good excuse they will make one up. I&#039;m guessing its due to a floood of orders. I think everyone got flooded when kush went on vacation. That is how good kush is lol.

He is putting up products that he actually has but is maybe just one dude trying to handle the massive amount.&nbsp; He&#039;s probably making so much money that he doesn&#039;t want to cut back to relieve some of his stress.<br />As long as you get it &amp; its decent stuff, I&#039;d give him the 5/5 and then if he did lie about the shipping or anything else that was a problem, you could just mention it in the comments.&nbsp; I like to let people know in the comment about how long it took for me to receive my order so they can kinda guess at what to expect for that anyway. most of his comments say fast shipping so if yours isnt fast you could put it on there so next person knows if they need it ASAP to maybe look elsewhere. <br /><br />Alright, suns up...birds chirping...time for bed&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; let me know if you get your stuff! you will get it! :)

				Thanks! I guess spam is good though because it shows us who to avoid. Unfortunately those fuckers get to 50 quicker than us. I am only 3 posts away now. And there aren&#039;t any good threads to post on. Lol.
