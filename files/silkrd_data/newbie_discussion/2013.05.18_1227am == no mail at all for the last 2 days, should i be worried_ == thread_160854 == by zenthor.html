				Normally mail would have been delivered 2 hours ago, 1 hour ago at the latest. there are lots of people that live at the address and there is normally a letter or at least junk mail every single day. For the last two days (starting the same day my first orders shipped) there has been no mail at all. Should I be worried?

				It could be a bit odd...I didn&#039;t have mail yesterday.<br />Since there&#039;s several other people that receive mail at that address, are you sure none of them snagged it and forgot to tell everyone else?

				nope i&#039;m the one who gets to the mail first, if i don&#039;t then the other person who does makes sure everyone gets their mail the same day. <br />it may be because someone moved out and probably filled out the paperwork to have their mail forwarded to their new address, and USPS may have forwarded all of the mail to them, that&#039;s the only possibility i can think of.<br />&nbsp;if nothing is here by tomorrow then i might really start to worry.
