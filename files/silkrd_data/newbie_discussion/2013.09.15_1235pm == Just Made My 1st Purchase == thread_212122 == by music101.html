				Just made my first purchase on the site this weekend, and looking forward to getting the product. When you got your first shipment in, were you like &quot;Holy Shit - I just got XXX delivered right to my door [or the mom and pop shop down the street]?&quot;<br /><br />I still kind of can&#039;t believe how easy it was after reading how the process works. Looking forward to being a member of the community.

				Yeah, I have heard that, but never really had access to one. With the exception of weed though, I usually don&#039;t find anything else, and I like to avoid walking up to people and asking if they can hook me up with anything else. <br /><br />But yeah - I am a total noob on here, but looking forward to getting rid of that &quot;stigma&quot; soon. (From what I read on here so far though, the fact that I took the time to learn about encryption, bitcoins, and computer setup to actually get on here puts me at a different level than a lot of newbies on here anyway. Also, I will never beg for coins...so there&#039;s that) LOL

				Yeah its ace! Been involved in the drug market on the clearnet for years so its not new to me, and i held off coming to SR cause i thought itd be the same only waay pricier, but the selection here is incredible, was a real shock to me! Signed up last week and made 11 orders so far, 2 of which i&#039;m sure is with a scammer (Dr Holland) but the resk should be here soon, its truely a great system haha<br /><br />Also 1 thing i was wondering, with this order i have with the guy whos turned scammer, loads of people have confirmed it, when i can resolve in a few days i&#039;ll try and get my money back since he wont reply to PMs at all, will this effect my buyer stats? Since i&#039;m pretty new and most vendors doint like dealing with noobs, especially noobs with shittie stats? So would getting my money back through the resolution center effect my buyer stats?<br /><br />Cheers

				Nah, there are vendors that will deal with low stats and they have good reputations for product, honesty and stealth, check their vending rules and ask them questions, I&#039;ve never gotten a dishonest answer yet. <br />I finished my first few orders on Friday so I am really excited. :)<br />Especially finally getting my hands on some of&nbsp; caerus&#039;s Fire OG (even though the photo of Grandaddy Purple was tempting, the reviews of the OG won me over).<br />I ordered them on the same day so its sort of a competition to see who delivers first. ;) With myself of course.<br />Both marked in transit around the same time. ;) Neither I nor they asked any questions so let the good times roll!<br />Fuck the man! Never FE! Read the reviews! Ask questions!<br />Edit: Caerus won the shipping challenge! Had to edit my post because it was not agreed to. :)<br />Enjoy!

				I&#039;ve dabbled with RC vendors on the clearnet prior to taking the plunge into SR, and I have to say SR is eons better. It seems that the initial requirement of needing to download the Tor bundle, figure out PGP, and utilize bitcoins manages to screen out a portion of the types of individuals who were present in RC clearnet communities. So far that I&#039;ve seen, the majority of the community on here is reasonable and careful. I really like that there is a drug safety section here that&#039;s stocked with information and discussion. <br /><br />My first purchase was also rather exciting to go through. I thoroughly respect that vendors take the time and effort to appropriately stealth their packaging and keep customers safe.

				Man, this is bringing back memories of my first purchase (not that it was all that long ago...I just seem to have spent much of the intervening time intoxicated, shockingly, so my sense of time may be just a little skewed...).&nbsp; It took me days to work out the whole system, learn about Tor, get BTC, have them transferred to my account, contact a vendor and place an order, so forth--each step becoming more convinced that something was going to go horribly wrong and I was going to be burned out of my cash (or worse) as punishment for letting myself get suckered into world that seemed to violate so many long-held notions of the way things &quot;have&quot; to be.&nbsp; Even after ordering, I mentally prepared myself for a LOOOONG wait (if my order even showed up at all, which I was doubtful it would).&nbsp; I readied myself for many days of disappointment from the repeated opening of an empty mailbox, and imagined with dreadful anticipation writing a message to the vendor with whom I&#039;d placed my order, in which I&#039;d bashfully mention that my order never showed up and ask with supreme helplessness what he suggest I do (&quot;fuck off&quot; being my anticipated answer, since I had FE&#039;d in order to get my order accepted in the first place). <br /><br />And yet, only two days after pressing that order button for the first time, I opened my mailbox and gasped when a small padded envelope sat there.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t believe my eyes--not when I opened the mailbox, not when I tore apart the package and five beautiful tablets were revealed inside (underneath layers of stealth, of course), not when I Googled the imprint to confirm their authenticity...but I couldn&#039;t HELP but believe them when my vision finally started to blur with the warmth of intoxication, and I knew that I had found a place that was very unique and very, very special.&nbsp; That moment will, of course, always be amongst the best of my highs, because it was about so much more than taking the drug itself (a drug which I had previously desired, but never had access to); it was about the validation of the effort--minor though it may have been--to discover the Silk Road and join the ranks of its buyers, and the thrill of discovery of a world that may very well defy the way things HAVE to be, yes, but that has instead captured with remarkable consistency (despite the flaws and imperfections that we all know exist) the way things SHOULD be--and CAN be, thanks to the efforts of enough like-minded individuals.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know I&#039;m getting a little lyrical about an entity that many would still condemn, but, in all my experience, I&#039;ve never seen a place (physical or ethereal) where the facilitation of drug use was accompanied so thoroughly by attention to safety, equanimity, and community.&nbsp; And so, welcome to the Road--hope it treats you as well as it&#039;s treated me, and that you do your best to sustain it as the kind of place we all hope it can be, with all its promise fulfilled.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the kind words and the stories.

				I made my first two orders late Friday night. one of them was marked in transit the next day. The other is still processing, but they&#039;re a very popular vendor that might not send packages out on Saturdays.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m expecting the high from actually having the package in my hands and opening said package to see my drugs in all their glory to be a more extreme euphoria than what I&#039;ll experience from the drugs themselves.<br /><br /><br />Not that is gonna be true at all (hopefully, haha)...but I will probably flip my shit when I see the letters in my mailbox.

				My first delivery has arrived and I&#039;m delighted, excited, confused and frustrated, the last two due only to my own silliness.<br /><br />I ordered a number of different whitish crystalline powders, some being substances I&#039;ve never tried before, so I&#039;m not quite sure whose order reached me first. It could be a full (overweight) gram of some orders or half of another order. The lack of country on the address suggests that it was sent domestically, so that might slightly help in narrowing it down. I have to go out soon so tasting and other testing will have to wait for later. I just wish I knew enough to be able to finalize immediately (unless it&#039;s something that I&#039;ve FEed for).<br /><br />Perhaps if I do similar in future I&#039;ll add a different middle initial to my name for each order to aid identification.<br /><br />Silly Cornie :)

				Yay for second post!<br /><br />Two more things arrived, one being the two-gram order. Although I can discern no particular smell, the crystalline structure, chemical taste and domestic address lead me to conclude that the first arrival was Symbiosis&#039;s mephedrone :)<br /><br />And such a variety of packaging and stealth methods...

				So - it came! I ordered up a few pills from Apollonian - and the postage was upgraded to priority for me - not sure if it is cause he was on vacation or if he was just being cool since it was my first order.<br /><br />But yeah, it got here, and I flipped on last night - so much better than the shit I tried like 10 years ago (I&#039;m in late 20s). I am gonna try and make up a trip report at some point, but it was the real deal!

				I know that feel bro! Just made my first purchase as well, after like ten months of lurking and researching and wanting to order I finally worked up the nerve. I decided to start small with blotters so it&#039;ll just look like a regular letter. Sampling some of Righteous&#039; 25i for the first time. Was gonna go with IndigoChild but Righteous&#039; had the right price. I&#039;m trying to make some money off it when I go to this festie in October. Anyone have any experience with him?<br /><br />Also I didn&#039;t realize the final price is related to whatever the BTC rate is at the time you finalize. That&#039;s kind of a bummer since the rate has been dropping every day. I might be hitting you up in a few days, CLK. :P

				Awesome man!<br />My first time I was (groundlessly) scared shitless that it was a sting of some sort. After all who had ever heard of buying weed on the internet as easily as buying shit off Amazon? Now all I worry about is the package accidentally getting delivered to the batshit crazy old hag of a neighbor I have.<br /><br />Keep ordering from good vendors (which is most of them) and you will continue to be elated.

				Congratulations, man! I hope to do that by this week or the next depending on how long it takes for my bitcoins to come in. I bet it feels fucking amazing that first time opening up that packet and knowing you truly can do anything you want if you just find a way ;D. Just be weary of scammers and what not, but considering that you seem to be doing things the right, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll do fine.

				Yeah - thanks guys and gals. It was fucking amazing to.<br /><br />And I think I am doing everything right - Reading feedback on all the vendors both on the forums and on their pages - refuse to finalize early - finalize and feed bac as soon as the product arrives. Seems to make everyone happy/

				Just made my first purchase as well. I&#039;m kind of surprised how confident I feel about this, it probably has to do with the fact that what I&#039;m ordering is decriminalized in my state and the most LE can do is write me a ticket. Fingers crossed for the arrival next week.

				3 orders arrived out of 10 made, i have pretty bad luck!

Just bad timing/luck i guess..<br /><br />@music101 yeah sounds like you got it :)<br /><br />And guys remember, in the extremely unlikely event of you getting a call from some unwelcome visitors, you have no idea at all, &#039;drugs? to me? what are you talking about?&#039;.
