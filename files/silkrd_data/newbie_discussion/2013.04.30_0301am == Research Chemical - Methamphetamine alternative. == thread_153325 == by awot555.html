				Hey guys ,<br /><br />I was wondering if there was an RC similar in every way to Methamphetamine HCL. <br /><br />I thought i was new to the world of RC&#039;s but a longtime street dealer recently admitted to me that for a long time what i was actually purchasing from him was Mephedrone - which i am led to believe is the chemical compound 4-MMC. That was always used IV. (Nice guys these street dealers aren&#039;t they?) <br /><br />I have been using Amphetamine type stims for abot 15 years and kind of new it wasn&#039;t quite speed or meth but was close enough..<br /><br />So i was kind of on a mission now to find what it was and bought some 4-MMC and while the cathinone smell was quite familiar and all of a sudden made sence to me, I decided to IV a little and found the effects to be quite different from what i remember and didn&#039;t think that was a good way of use so I smoked some and noticed that it went black too easily and i do not recall his stuff doing that So i snorted some and ate the rest. Eating is was by far the way to go and i was pleasantly surprised at the roll just like MDMA.<br /><br />My next stop was MDPV which i find scary. I IV&#039;d about 50mg of it and was off chops in a way which was OK, but after my second hit about 12 hours later I decided that ending up in the nuthouse sometime in the next 2 weeks was not appealing. I have never really suffered psychosis or any of the usual delusions associated with amphetamines but i could tell very early on that this drug was probably the one that could do it, so i ended up giving the rest away to a few friends and pretty much watched them all get completely scattered.<br /><br />I also tried Pre ban DMAA which was good the first couple time&nbsp; and then became very crappy, very quickly. But if you are ever looking for a way to dehydrate you body to a consistency of beef jerky in a very short time then this could&nbsp; be the drug for you, otherwise there is not much more to refort about this one.<br /><br /><br />So does anyone know of an RC that is similar to amphetamine or the more potent Methamphetamine? <br /><br />please chime in and tell me your experiences.
