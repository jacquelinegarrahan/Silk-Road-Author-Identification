				Scammers will now not be able to make it more then 10 minutes after they commence their shameful shenanigans.<br />How is that so?<br />Very simple.<br /><br />The following came to me in a dream/a little birdie told me/ :<br /><br />DPR and his team have editted the code and tweaked the system over the last few hours so that whenever a scam is reported, the bitcoin address that money is to be sent to (scammers address), is put into a field known as &quot;Invalid Address&quot;. So when the innocent scammee puts in the scammers wallet address and tries to sent them money, they get a &quot;INVALID ADDRESS&quot; in red font (the same if one was too put a few random characters in the wallet address and try to send). Very clever, very efficient, and elegant. Perfect solution. Surprised they didn&#039;t think of this before. Now scammers are fucked. <br /><br />Me and my team might or might not have a friend inside the core technical committee here, we might or might not be able to see things others can&#039;t see, or we might or might not just be hallucinating and have imagined this. <br /><br />&nbsp;I think this is a HUGE plus for SR. This is a good thing that will keep us all safer from these shithead scammerz. <br />I hope I didn&#039;t reveal too much information. Knowing the eager-beaver censorers around here wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this thread gets deleted.. but that&#039;d make no sense.

				It still relies on people realising it is a scam and reporting it.&nbsp; The problem with the one the other day was that too many people believed it and put money in straight away.&nbsp; Apart from that and if what you say is true, it&#039;s an elegant solution.&nbsp; Nice one :)

				I have run into a big problem with the new system for preventing scams. I have run my little uninformed and disconnected from the powers that be - test. And the system is preventing my legitimate activities in one regard.<br /><br />However, having said that I have found a simple work-around that scammers will not be able to use without detection after a little bit of digital investigation.<br /><br />So although OP may have been the one who came up with the plan, and it may indeed help, it ain&#039;t what&#039;s being advertised.<br /><br />Nuff said.<br /><br />Modzi<br /><br />

				Sounds like something that would only apply to a very specific sort of scam. Who in their right mind is sending BTC to an addy versus sticking with the escrow system?

				It&#039;s sad that people out there want to steal from other members but it&#039;s good to know the people in charge have already slammed the door shut on these disgusting attempts to rip people off. Props to the SR staff for keeping their finger on the pulse.
