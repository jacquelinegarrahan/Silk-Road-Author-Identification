				Hey everybody!<br /><br />I recently bought my first bitcoins and transfered them to my wallet. Then I wanted to make a deposit on SR, but the coins didn&#039;t arrive yet!<br />It&#039;s been several hours now and I wonder what happened to my coins...<br /><br />Is it common that there is a delay when depositing on SR?<br />My wallet says the transaction is complete (confirmed).<br /><br />I doubt that someone scammed me, I&#039;ve been pretty careful!<br /><br />I hope someone can tell me what to do...

				BTC transfers to SR can take awhile for any number of reasons, sometimes there is a lag in the market due to high volume of trades. I&#039;d wait before getting too worried. <br /><br />SR was down due to maintenance yesterday so something could have been mucked up.

				Yes, there have been some pretty long delays recently.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t received your coins in 24 hours, send SR Support a message on the main site.

				I contacted silkroad support three hours ago and they still haven&#039;t responded. I&#039;ve also had a lot of problems with blockchain to SR recently. Anyone know why support still hasn&#039;t responded?

It sounds like you already had the coins in a wallet at an exchange though in which case the coins will leave that wallet but not show up in you S.R. wallet for several hours which is typical. Stay away from Bitinstant though. My &quot;instant&quot; transaction there took 4-5 days to get to the exchange and only after countless emails and messaging on their customer support forum.

				Do blockchain to SR transactions usually take a while? In general, does blockchain tend to be slow when executing a transaction?

				No, it&#039;s not blockchain&#039;s issue - it&#039;s an SR issue.

				I had a block chain not complete for days. The BTC transferred but not the change. I sent some more to the addy, and after an hours or so it completed both transactions.<br /><br />The network must be hopping today. BTC is moving up, and down wildly. Did a wallet transfer in about an hour today.

				I&#039;d say you&#039;re panicking a bit early.&nbsp; Check back in 24 hours. Transfers are not instant because SR obfuscates the transaction in a tumbler which requires some number n transactions between random SR-controlled addresses between the address they give you to send your BTC to and the final address where the BTC is held until you purchase (which you don&#039;t see).
