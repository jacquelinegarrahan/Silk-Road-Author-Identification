				Hey all, this is another of those &#039;please help me&#039; emails which I have read a lot of already on this forum over the past week.<br /><br />I&#039;m very new to this, but have progressed so far as to:<br />&nbsp;- purchase some bitcoins<br />&nbsp;- work out how to use pgp (thanks gpg4usb, you are very easy to use!)<br />&nbsp;- read a lot of forum posts on security, money, qualities of product etc.<br /><br />What i&#039;m now ready to do (I think) is get in there and start buying, mainly on Coke and E...&nbsp; Before I do that, I have a few questions, and if anyone can spend 5 minutes helping out a fellow newbie, then i&#039;ll be eternally grateful for any and all advice<br /><br />1.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on buying domestically in Aus for my first few purchases - it just seems as though international is a bit hard at the moment with all the publicity, and besides, the stuff I was buying through other channels was more money anyway.&nbsp; Does anyone have any comments on the quality and reliability of the mail service domestically in Aus?&nbsp; I have read a lot about the difficulty with international &#039;mail&#039; but domestic doesn&#039;t get a lot of airplay.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; With respect to delivery - I have read a lot of comments that talk about use of &#039;fake&#039; names - and yet the general advice is to not use your real name (for obvious reasons)... Does anyone have any advice here?&nbsp; I was going to use the previous occupant&#039;s name, as I still receive mail addressed to them all the time!<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Once I get the package - is there any advice on waiting to open it, in case you receive a visit from the authorities?<br /><br />As I said above, any and all advice will be gratefully received<br /><br /><br />
