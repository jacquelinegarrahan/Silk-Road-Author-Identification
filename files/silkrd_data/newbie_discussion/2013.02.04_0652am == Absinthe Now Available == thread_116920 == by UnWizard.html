				DrChong, there is also someone selling &quot;moonshine&quot; of very high proof on the Road. I felt the need to offer Absinthe for three reasons:<br />1- It&#039;s a psychedelic, plant derived drug that most people have never had an opportunity try.<br />2- It is regulated/prohibited in many parts of the world and therefore unavailable to most.<br />3- The few products on the market are made from non-organic herbs and non-organic/GMO alcohol, which is bad for you and the planet.

I use only the finest quality USP tested pharmaceutical grade certified organic alcohol which is free of methanol and other cogeners that would harm your body and ruin the flavor of the drink.<br />You should know that there are significant levels of the poison methanol in beer and wine, since they are not purified through distillation, and this methanol content is one contributing factor to the &quot;hangover&quot; you get after a long night of drinking these products. Distilled alcohol CAN be much purer but some cheap alcohol or bad moonshine will still contain some methanol and other cogeners.<br /><br />

So, it seems from all my research and historical readings that the sugar cube tradition came about when absinthe became so popular in France that the market became flooded with cheap imitations of the real thing; think industrial alcohol with wormwood essential oils, artificial coloring, and questionable flavoring compounds added to it. These products would have been so bitter and foul tasting that a sugar cube would have been a logical choice for making it more drinkable.<br />The product I produce tastes great and really needs nothing more than some chilled water added to bring the alcohol content down to a reasonable level (it is bottled at 144 proof, 72% ABV).&nbsp; That being said sugar cubes, absinthe fountains and slotted silver spoons do look really cool and help add to the magic and mystery of the legendary drink! Try it without sugar cubes but feel free to use them if you are trying to impress your friends! Real absinthe is naturally sweet (due to the high levels of Anethol, which is 11 times sweeter than sugar!) Unless you really like sugary drinks you will probably find that it needs no additions!<br /><br />A few years ago the authorities in the USA agreed to let seller market &quot;absinthe&quot; in the US. The regulations on it limit the amount of Thujone, a chemical found in Wormwood, Hyssop, and Tarragon amongst other herbs. This combined with the fact that Americans had never really tasted the real thing has led to a market filled with weak interpretations of the real thing that are missing a crucial component. I have spoken to some of the people who make these products and they found that they can only add trace amounts of Wormwood without exceeding the government set limit of 10 ppm (that equates to 10mg per liter of product). Alcohol content is also restricted to less than 60% ABV. <br />I use generous amounts of&nbsp; Organic Wormwood, Hyssop, Tarragon and 7 other herbs and can ensure a high Thujone content and a completely traditional absinthe taste and experience. It&#039;s just like you would have gotten if you&#039;d ordered a round of absinthe with the likes of Vincent van Gogh, Charles Baudelaire, or Oscar Wilde in a smokey Parisian cafe in the late 1800&#039;s!<br />Thanks for these great questions! Keep &#039;em coming!

People who rarely drink or become drunk very easily seem to feel the &quot;buzz&quot; and report a &quot;more than just alcohol&quot; effect after only a single drink (about 1 oz.). Folks who drink a lot of alcohol usually jump in head first and have a few glasses and are less aware of the &quot;come up&quot; and it usually hits them with a little more surprise. Usually this plays out as someone not realizing that they are intoxicated on absinthe because instead of feeling the usual &quot;fucked up&quot; feeling alcohol they feel relatively sober, clear headed, alert, and energized. But that&#039;s exactly what absinthe is all about; you are drunk but you are sharper, clearer more articulate than you are on alcohol alone. You find yourself engaging in conversation much more complex than the usual drunken chatter you&#039;d usually make. You appreciate art, music, architecture and everything else instead of glazing over like you might on a whiskey drunk. Your thoughts become more fluid, creativity and ideas flow easily, your imagination becomes alive! This is the psychedelic effect of absinthe, your consciousness is loosened, opened up and perception of the world around you is subtly changed.<br />This is what I can tell you about dosing,;everyone must try absinthe for themselves because just like cannabis or beer, everyone has a different preferred level of intoxication and requires a different amount to reach that state!<br />I do recommend drinking it somewhat slowly, having many glasses over a long evening rather than trying to rapidly drink strong &quot;shots&quot; of it. After all it is a powerful herbal product and should be treated with respect especially if you are unfamiliar with it.<br />

				Always found it amusing that a drink with such cachet and popularity/notoriety came from, basically, backwoods herbal medicine. I&#039;ve tried a couple variations of the stuff, european and the legalized u.s. stuff, and did find that the import stuff was more pleasant. I recall the american stuff (La Fee maybe?) was mostly just overpowering in alcohol, low in flavor, and tasted mostly like green NyQuil. The smaller european imported bottle I got as a gift from France wasn&#039;t bad, meanwhile.<br /><br />A brief word for those who think that drinking absinthe is going to &quot;make you see green faeries and trippy shit&quot;: It won&#039;t. Thujone does have some interesting properties (among them a chemical structure similar to THC), and consumption of the stuff seems to act as a mood enhancer in my experience, but it certainly won&#039;t prompt hallucinations. Having consumed a whole bottle in an evening, the worst part was just the hangover from high-proof spirit (and a certain amount of emotional lability and openness. UnWizard&#039;s suggestion that it&#039;s kind of an &quot;alcohol-plus&quot; in effect is pretty much spot on). <br /><br />It also won&#039;t make you crazy (unless you&#039;re suffering DTs or other alcohol-related physical/neural trauma). The old diagnosis of &quot;Absinthism&quot; from the past centuries was, from what I gather, the effects of metal or other toxic substance poisoning. Brewers working too quickly to cash in on the absinthe craze of the Victorian era were doing things like adding cupric salts to their mixture to get more vivid green colors, or other substances added in to improve the &#039;louche&#039; effect, or just fucking up royally and using oil of wormwood (a very poisonous alkaloid) instead of the wormwood extract (which contained the thujone and some of the flavor of artemisia absinthum).<br /><br />For any serious technical and experiential information beyond what I can provide, I definitely recommend Erowid (and for more than just Thujone, too, of course).<br /><br />That said, if you&#039;re interested in a historic drink with an unusual flavor, and something of an acquired taste (and yes, UnWizard is correct; this stuff is NOT meant to be slammed back in shots. The traditional bohemian preparation is the best method IMHO), I say give it a whirl. I&#039;m not much of an alcohol drinker these days, but I&#039;m still tempted nonetheless myself.

				Thank you Miles for you contribution to the discussion. I invite you to look more deeply into the herbal potion that is absinthe; it is a lot more than ethanol and thujone! The other traditional herbs used in the preparation, in my opinion, play a much stronger role in the psychoactive effects of the drink. If you are curious about it you should look into the effects of Anethol, from anise, star anise, and fennel seed. Hyssop, Lemon Balm, Coriander seed, Calamus root, and Tarragon leaf. All of these contain a myriad of psychoactive alkaloids and should not be considered mere &quot;flavorings&quot;! It&#039;s a remarkably complex concoction and it&#039;s effects have not been pinned down to thujone or ethanol with any level of certainty.

And how&#039;s the louche?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you. That is a completely natural emerald green from fresh herbs, which means that it will fade to an olive yellow over time, especially if it&#039;s exposed to UV light. The taste is actually where most of the work has gone into this product. I&#039;ve formulated it through countless recipe changes to have just the right amount of everything, none of the herbs taking too much of your attention. The feedback from people tasting it for the first time is overwhelmingly positive. Those who have had absinthe in the past are usually surprised that absinthe can actually taste good, or that it might actually be enjoyed BECAUSE of the way it tastes! I think you will not be disappointed!<br />Because the recipe has been designed to present a balanced profile of herbs and well matched levels of psychoactive alkaloids the louche is much less extreme than some absinthe. Louche occurs when Anethol, the flavor compound found in Anise, Star Anise, Fennel, and Caraway comes out of solution with the addition of water. Many absinthes have entirely too much Anethol and it dominates the flavor profile, probably because louche is a major gimmick factor or &quot;special effect&quot; that people demand from the fake &quot;absinthe&quot; they buy at the liquor store. <br />The product I make has a beautiful louche but it is best observed when mixing the absinthe with ice cold water. At room temperature the louche is more subtle. I find that it tastes best ice cold and usually serve it in a glass with purified water ice, enjoying the flavors change as more ice is melted and the alcohol content goes down.<br />The louche of my Absinthe Blanc (uncolored, clear absinthe) is the most impressive. It turns from crystal clear to a pale blue opalescent opaque liquid just by adding cold water! Light reflecting off of the liquid appears blue, while light shinning through a glass of it appears a pale saffron yellow! While the liquid has no true color itself the light is changed by the millions of tiny colloidal Anethol droplets, creating a gemstone like optical wonder in a glass!<br />Cheers!

				Responding to an earlier post but did not feel the need to quote. While it is true that they do sell a product in the US labeled as &quot;Absinthe&quot; it is in fact NOT Absinthe but the chosen verbiage is &quot;The Essence of Absinthe&quot;. Meaning like previously mentioned by OP that the levels of thujone it is allowed to contain are very miniscule and it is essentially liquor with the color and flavor of Absinthe but none of the effects. I brought a couple of bottles of real Absinthe with me from Europe. Have you ever been &quot;pass out drunk&quot; but fully aware of your surrounding environment to include multiple conversations at the same time? That&#039;s what I got when mixing Absinthe and Tequila. (So drunk I couldn&#039;t stand, let alone walk, but hyper-aware to what was being said in multiple conversations.

				Have wanted to try true absinthe for a very long time, unfortunately I&#039;m the kind of person who is scared off by new vendors. You seem legit though, and when I have some extra BTC to buy some you will probably be more established by then. Do you plan on being around for a while?<br /><br />I&#039;ve made quite a large list of substances I would like to some day try throughout the years, and now that I have found SR they&#039;re pretty much all available! Gotta love it! Only problem is that I&#039;d most likely end up spending over $1,000 buying drugs for just myself to try if I were to get only a few doses of them all, but I&#039;m definitely not complaining&nbsp; ;D

Do you have to drink it through a sugar cube or have I been reading too much Hemingway?<br /><br />I heard it is available in the USA now. How do you make yours differently?<br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The great sugar cube question! So, it seems from all my research and historical readings that the sugar cube tradition came about when absinthe became so popular in France that the market became flooded with cheap imitations of the real thing; think industrial alcohol with wormwood essential oils, artificial coloring, and questionable flavoring compounds added to it. These products would have been so bitter and foul tasting that a sugar cube would have been a logical choice for making it more drinkable.<br />The product I produce tastes great and really needs nothing more than some chilled water added to bring the alcohol content down to a reasonable level (it is bottled at 144 proof, 72% ABV).&nbsp; That being said sugar cubes, absinthe fountains and slotted silver spoons do look really cool and help add to the magic and mystery of the legendary drink! Try it without sugar cubes but feel free to use them if you are trying to impress your friends! Real absinthe is naturally sweet (due to the high levels of Anethol, which is 11 times sweeter than sugar!) Unless you really like sugary drinks you will probably find that it needs no additions!<br /><br />A few years ago the authorities in the USA agreed to let seller market &quot;absinthe&quot; in the US. The regulations on it limit the amount of Thujone, a chemical found in Wormwood, Hyssop, and Tarragon amongst other herbs. This combined with the fact that Americans had never really tasted the real thing has led to a market filled with weak interpretations of the real thing that are missing a crucial component. I have spoken to some of the people who make these products and they found that they can only add trace amounts of Wormwood without exceeding the government set limit of 10 ppm (that equates to 10mg per liter of product). Alcohol content is also restricted to less than 60% ABV. <br />I use generous amounts of&nbsp; Organic Wormwood, Hyssop, Tarragon and 7 other herbs and can ensure a high Thujone content and a completely traditional absinthe taste and experience. It&#039;s just like you would have gotten if you&#039;d ordered a round of absinthe with the likes of Vincent van Gogh, Charles Baudelaire, or Oscar Wilde in a smokey Parisian cafe in the late 1800&#039;s!<br />Thanks for these great questions!
