				so i&#039;ve looked up some discussion about this.. and it seems that bitcoins have almost tripled, mainly because supply is finite/dwindling while demand is continually rising..<br /><br />but man, it has tripled in price these past few months.

				if it does crash, i think it&#039;ll eventually return to its pre-crash prices. if there&#039;s a security leak (decrease in demand) then it&#039;ll drop for a while, but will eventually go back all the way up. <br /><br />i think i should put some more money into bitcoins.

				It doesn&#039;t really effect anyone in the long run who&#039;s buying btc to spend straight away, since most stuff is pegged to a dollar value on sr. But it goes to show, it&#039;s rising so quickly atm that in the hour it took me to a put in a few orders the total value dropped by about .10btc. Not much, but every little helps :P

				I actually plan to hold on to a few bitcoin after each purchase.<br /><br />When the new miners come out, and the difficulty goes up a few more times you will be glad you had a few in your pocket.<br /><br />Hoarding takes them out of circulation also increasing their value so you are helping your own price go up by not spending all of them right away. (I know look where we are.)

				I imaging that the people holding them will see the market stagnant and sell them off groping the price. <br /><br />Also I think if it goes too high people will find alternatives. <br /><br />Right now they are legal but I could see them become illegal at the whim of various governments which could make the worthless. <br /><br />But who knows. <br /><br />Also while I don&#039;t think sites like Sr could be shut down it is not impossible. But if something like that were to happen it could instantly drop the price of bitcoin. <br /><br />I think you will see people speculating in them but I don&#039;t know if long term investment in them is a good idea. <br /><br />However, I may be 100 % wrong on this and might change my thoughts on this topic. <br /><br />In the short term they are def on their way up so I think it would be good idea hold on to a few.&nbsp;

				BTC is a huge gamble.<br /><br />If you had $1k 2 days ago, you&#039;d have an extra $125 today. You can say in the long run prices will return to what they were in case of a crash. REALLY? They say bitcoins are peer distributed and don&#039;t have a single point of failure. What is silk road disappears for good. Will BTC prices return? SIlk road it bitcoins&#039; single point of failure. No road, no value, IMO. What else will you buy?

				We buy Bitcoins to save, as well as spend.&nbsp; A lot harder to buy them in UK, but not if you know where to look.&nbsp; BTC can be used for quite a lot of things, not just Silk Road.&nbsp; The fact you can hold them, and no one knows you have got them, like the taxman for instance, makes them a very attractive option as you can move money around the world quickly with no trace.

				80% of BTC volume is hoarded. So if you&#039;re going to buy in the thought of cashing out in 6 months or a year, realize it&#039;s risky. A few large actors could dump millions of BTC&#039;s, leaving all us small guys fucked.

				I so wish i had known about btc earlier and dumped a load of money into it, but then what do they say ... hindsight is 20/20. <br /><br />Interesting to see LTC (litecoin) in its infancy. Anyone have any experience with this? I guess it would be good to buy some in the hope that SR might start trading in LTC. I imagine that if SR did begin trading in LTC, their worth would skyrocket.

				Trading at around $17 right now according to MtGox. Went up to $19 today, seems like some asshole immediately sold around $150k at $19 which dropped it down to the $16-$17 range. Some of us have been expecting this since it first hit $15. We figured it would hit a wall and roll back and that&#039;s what happened. Didn&#039;t figure on it being just one asshole selling his entire wallet though. I&#039;ve still made some money off this little mini-bubble. My last Coinbase order was when it was around $14.50.

				I&#039;ve been using btc for about a year now and while the prices go up and down and fluctuate, the overall trend has been up, and pretty steadily by my observations. They were around $4-5 i think when I first bought some and now they are 4x that. Not bad if you happen to have some stored away.<br /><br />The only thing is I don&#039;t know enough about mining and the rate at which new coins come into the marketplace vs the increasing demand for them. BECAUSE, I expect the demand for them to increase, I&#039;d be willing to bet on this, I just don&#039;t know enough about the supply of btc to feel like I should be investing in them. I hope I don&#039;t regret it when I can&#039;t even afford 1 BTC!

To start, the current total number of Bitcoins in existence (as of this writing) is 10,698,425. Because of the architecture of the Bitcoin currency, there can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. So we&#039;re about halfway there, but not in terms of the amount of time it takes which I&#039;ll get to in a second. Enthusiasts have calculated that all of the Bitcoins will have been generated at or near the year 2140. <br /><br />This link is a graph of the total number of Bitcoins (in millions) generated over time by year.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/thumb/e/e3/Total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png/740px-Total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png<br /><br />So you can see that in 2010 there were around 3 million. You can see a pretty neat parabola. The infrastructure was built to mimic the mining of actual precious minerals, which because of their scarcity, maintain their value well. The system basically generated a lot of Bitcoins at first, and then less as time goes on. So if you&#039;re a Bitcoin miner, you&#039;re mining less Bitcoins per kWh (of electricity spent on running a mining rig) in January 2013 than you were in 2010, and you&#039;ll be making less next year as well. Thus the invention of ASICs, the industry name for specialized chips designed for Bitcoin mining, which you can read about here:<br /><br />http://www.technologyreview.com/news/508061/custom-chips-could-be-the-shovels-in-a-bitcoin-gold-rush/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107200.msg760457#msg760457">Quote from: #slothrop on January 25, 2013, 03:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m no expert but BTC seem to be to be especially volatile.

With the amount of Bitcoin being spent or otherwise transacted every year, all of the existing businesses that are beginning to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment such as Wordpress, and especially with the black market appeal of SR, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s likely to see very many more &quot;big&quot; crashes like in 2011 when it went from $30 to $2. It&#039;s pretty widely understood in the Bitcoin community that as they are accepted by more businesses, their value will stabilize.

The public keys are published in the blockchain which is public. But the private key, which is what gives you ownership of the coins and allows you to sign transactions as authentic, stays safe and hidden. In hindsight, it seems like an obvious idea. One of those &quot;Why didn&#039;t I think of this before?&quot; deals. PGP was invented by a guy named Phil Zimmermann in 1991, but it took until 2009 for somebody to think of creating Bitcoin. And nobody has any idea who the inventor is. It&#039;s a total fucking mystery. That&#039;s my favorite part of the whole story. The guy invented a currency under a fake name, provided technical support for a year and then left in the middle of 2010. No trace.<br /><br />If you&#039;re curious about how secure PGP is, devices containing PGP-encrypted files have been intercepted multiple times by a multitude of different law enforcement agencies. The more widely-publicized cases indicate that no law enforcement agency has the ability to decrypt these files without the private key. As of about 2007 police have resorted to using legislature to force people to provide their passwords/keys. In the UK for example a man was jailed for 9 months for refusing to provide police with his encryption keys.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality

The public keys are published in the blockchain which is public. But the private key, which is what gives you ownership of the coins and allows you to sign transactions as authentic, stays safe and hidden. In hindsight, it seems like an obvious idea. One of those &quot;Why didn&#039;t I think of this before?&quot; deals. PGP was invented by a guy named Phil Zimmermann in 1991, but it took until 2009 for somebody to think of creating Bitcoin. And nobody has any idea who the inventor is. It&#039;s a total fucking mystery. That&#039;s my favorite part of the whole story. The guy invented a currency under a fake name, provided technical support for a year and then left in the middle of 2010. No trace.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is intriguing that it took so long for a currency based on PKI to be implemented and become popular. As you said, in hindsight it appears to be obvious. I had actually been curious about the original BTC inventor but never curious enough to do the research. Very interesting, thanks!
