				I have read another post where people are having the same issue as me with this sam giancana retard. I ordered last week (7 business days ago) something that was going express post, 3 days gaurenteed. He sends me a us postal tracking number. This, for something that is supposed to be shipped from canada to canada. The tracking number is fake and now he will not respond. Do not purchase from this clown. I am unsure of wheater or not i can recover my funds or not. I did not FE this retard.

				Four days after your order is placed you can cancel it if the vendor hasn&#039;t placed the order into transit.&nbsp; Once they place it into transit you have to wait until the resolve link becomes active, at which point you can ask the vendor for a refund.&nbsp; Make sure you do not let it auto-finalize or you will lose your money and there will be little anyone can do about it.<br /><br />If the vendor has already placed the order in transit you can ask them to cancel it OR PM SR support/admin on SR and explain the issue and ask them if they can cancel the order (also, click on the &#039;Report Vendor&#039; link in their profile to report what you say has happened).<br /><br />If you have FE&#039;d then there isn&#039;t much anyone can do for you now.

				Is scamming really worth it?&nbsp; With the bond amount being so high you would have to do some pretty fancy footwork to make that up and get any sizable amount over that for it to be worth it.&nbsp; New vendors don&#039;t have customers so the only way I can think of would be to offer something that&#039;s probably too good to be true and in bulk then get multiple people to be stupid enough (or gullible) AND get them to FE!&nbsp; Really how is it possible?
