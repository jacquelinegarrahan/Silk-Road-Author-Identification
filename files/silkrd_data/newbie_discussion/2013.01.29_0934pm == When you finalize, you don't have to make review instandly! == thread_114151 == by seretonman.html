				Please make no review after you finalize because of FE. You can do that when you receive your goods!

				Try it at your next transaction. When you click on the finalize button, you don&#039;t have to make the review. You can wait some days. If everyone would do so, you would not see at the review FE, FE for trusted vendor...

				Tnx, thats good to know. <br /><br />And sometimes its good to finalize early so the vendors dont loose their profit, if the BTC have been very high when one orders, and <br />its in a downward spiral.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s only good for the vendor. The only vendor I FE is Afterhour. Supertrips wants it under 1000$ and i suggest not to do it!

				This is a very good point that needs to be known to newbies. If you finalize early, and as newbies you may be required to, you should only finalize and not leave a review, just close the page when the review screen comes up. It will save your spot, and then when you receive the product and test it, you can go back and leave a review. It&nbsp; makes for a better system than a bunch of reviews that are really just previews and useless therefore.

				Thanks so true. When people FE they usually comment based on past experience from the vendor and just update about the recent product when they receive it.

				Yeah it&#039;s very easy to go in and edit the feedback you have left for a vendor.&nbsp; Just click on account, view feedback, and then edit whichever feedback you want.&nbsp; Obviously, you aren&#039;t qualified to review services until you&#039;ve been fully serviced!&nbsp; This means receiving your package, seeing how stealthy it is, testing the product, etc.&nbsp; I usually just put &quot;FE for trusted seller, will update when it arrives.&quot;&nbsp; The trick here is you should actually update.&nbsp; Good vendors need and deserve positive reviews of the service they do for us!
