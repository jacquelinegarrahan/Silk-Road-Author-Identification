				Well this is an old post but it will get my count up.<br /><br />Really - you need us to tell you if you should get yourself a heroin habit?<br /><br /><br />Typical getting yourself addicted to heroin is a bad idea.&nbsp; I have never tried meth - but have been addicted to heroin all my adult life. 19 years in total.<br />Id say heroin addiction is not as bad for your mental health as meth is - stimulants seem to have a BAD effect on ppls mental health.<br />Physical its NOT as bad as ppl say it is to come off - not physically any way - its just people dont wnat to give up because like with any addiction it becomes a major crutch.<br /><br />If I was choosing an addiction - Meth or smack Id choose smack.&nbsp; Even before I took smack I think I would have said that. stimulants scare me. I am addicted to crack<br />and I dont like it - yeah I know weird not liking something youre addicted to - I chase how crack used to feel - the first pipe or speedball with crack is good but after that I just get wired and panicy and aaaaHAHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br /><br /><br />My general advice would be do not start ussing heroin as you will most likely become a poly drug user - mixing meth with heroin.<br />Not a good idea<br />If you need to replace - I suggest coffee, cigarettes and weed.
