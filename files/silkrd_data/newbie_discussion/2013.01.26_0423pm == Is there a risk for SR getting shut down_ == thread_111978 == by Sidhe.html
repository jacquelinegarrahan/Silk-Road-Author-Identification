				Hey everyone, I&#039;m a new member. So excited to start shopping from SR! This is a great organization and I am forever grateful that it exists. I do have a question though... I APOLOGIZE IF THIS HAS BEEN ASKED BEFORE. How is it not getting shut down? I&#039;m genuinely curious. How can a site like this operate without the feds being all over it? There are articles about it on the interwebz so it&#039;s no secret. Is there some sort of loophole (like Piratebay, for instance) where they can&#039;t take legal action against it? I&#039;d like to know because I&#039;m over the moon about this right now and I would absolutely hate for a gem like this to get shut down one day.

				This is a TOR hidden service run by anonymous individuals who are paid in untraceable cryptographic currency. Given enough time I&#039;m sure someone will make a mistake and it will get shut down, I hope not, but probability suggests that this will happen sometime in the future. If I were DPR then I&#039;d hand the site over to someone else after I&#039;d made my millions, because I wouldn&#039;t want to be the person holding the hand grenade when the music finally stops.<br /><br />If and when this does happen there will be lots of drama for a month or so, then ten more sites will rise to take its place.<br /><br />You can protect yourself by never keeping more money than you can afford to lose in your SR account, by always encrypting your address when making purchases, by never revealing personal information on these forums and by following general computer security advice.

				Bitcoins aren&#039;t untraceable. They&#039;re incredibly traceable as every transaction is in a public record. The anonymous (not untraceable) part of them is that you can&#039;t (easily) ID who owns what address. That is where the safety lies. SR also tumbles so coins in are not the same coins out. If someone got a hold of a list of addresses SR used then every BTC that passed through SR could be IDd.<br />You can easily follow BTC around where they have been though.<br /><br />However, no it is not likely SR will be shut down anytime in the near future. There are attacks that can occur on the TOR network but have not yet and would require a large amount of resources to do.

				Hypothetically if it were to shut down, would the price of BTC rice or fall. I feel like it would fall for a month or so then soar into levels unseen. kinda how when it went offline for a week. wish i had purchased when i wanted too when i saw it at 9

				Even if the feds/interpool could shut it down I imagine they would hold off because of what was already mentioned above: 10 more sites will pop up replacing it. If its the feds we are talking about.. I&#039;m HOPING DOJ is under orders to turn a blind eye to the whole thing. I know that&#039;s not likely though.

				I like to&nbsp; think that there are feds and LEO of all sorts, operating to some degree on the SR and forums at any given time.. Only the big picture is, they have enough to deal with at street and major IRL supplier levels. Secondly, I dont feel that the government will ever truly put an end to this place, whether or not that actually can is besides the point, what I feel it boils down to, is the general balance of things. If they were to shut this place down, that balance of cops and robbers, bad and good, dealers and those who bust dealers, along with the justice system and a whole lot more, would be thrown all the fuck out of wack. <br /><br />&nbsp;I made a post a while back, not sure what thread, but i went on to rant about our &#039;criminal justice system&#039; and prisons here in the states, and the bottom line is, A). there simply isnt enough room in the jails for even a fraction of the the buyers and sellers of drugs, and B) most importantly, the buyers and users of drugs play a key role in making the world go round. <br /><br />&nbsp;For any one that hasnt looked into it, the US government was rumored and in some cases proven to take a hand in the actual supply and distribution of massive amounts of highly addictive drugs, such as plane loads of kilos a top kilos of coke. Just my opinion anyway.

				If it does most vendor&#039;s have an tormail adress read your vendor&#039;s page&#039;s,it does say on them to be used in the unlikely event SR is ever down but I think that would probably apply to SR being shut down if that ever happens if you have good trust with a certain vendor and are a regular buyer,but I wouldn&#039;t expect them to be as open to anybody buying like we can now.<br />&nbsp;;)<br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)

				I truly just wish that I had gotten further involved earlier about 15 months ago when I found out about it. The BTC rate was about 1/3 of what it is now! fuck that woulda been a good financial investment

It also encrypts SR&#039;s location and gives it a URL that&#039;s only accessible on the deepweb. <br />2) Tor relays and servers are usually encrypted. If you&#039;re using SR and not using encryption, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY suggest you do.<br />If your computer is encrypted and locked, as soon as it&#039;s turned off, a password is needed to decrypt it. This password can be theoretically hacked, and that &#039;theoretically&#039; goes out the window if you don&#039;t use a long 15 to 30 character password.<br /><br />Basically, SR is hosted on an encrypted tor node that hides it location, and it&#039;s encrypted so that if the feds ever DID bust in, as soon as the power is killed then none of the data is able to be recovered.<br /><br />So don&#039;t use onion.to tor gateway, your passwords and activity is easily sniffed out and linked to your IP. <br />Also <br />&gt;interwqebz<br />This isn&#039;t 4chan or 7chan.

				It&#039;s likely to get shut down but it&#039;s more likely to be compromised and hacker attacks faked to fund the US government basically making the site a source of government income.<br />That&#039;s how the politicians think anyway.

				I love much of what I read on this forum, <br />this post is &quot;mucho amuzing&quot; (feels like reading Dune and &quot;the spice must flow&quot; - kinda talk)<br /><br />SR been shut down is always a risk, <br />don&#039;t put any money in here that you can&#039;t miss...<br />if anything does go wrong, just walk away and don&#039;t look back...<br /><br />in the meanwhile, I tend to think that the CIA has been making zillions of $ over the last half century on drug&#039;s, why would they stop now? if they ever get hold of SR (if this isn&#039;t already the case) why would they kill the goose with the golden eggs?

				Of course there is just like there is risk of anything at all.<br /><br />You risk getting into a car accident by driving.<br /><br />Guess its a legitimate question but I would worry more about the vendors you choose then this site going down very soon.
