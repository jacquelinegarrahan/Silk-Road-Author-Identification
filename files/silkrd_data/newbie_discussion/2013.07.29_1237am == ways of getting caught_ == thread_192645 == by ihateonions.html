				Just sussing a few things out. i got my first order last week and everything went really smoothly thanks to a bit of advise from a few guru&#039;s on this site. (thanks guys!) <br />without actually getting caught with stuff on you what are some of the ways that you can get caught?<br />bitcoins arnt illegal to buy, and even if they saw you going into a bank and depositing money surely they then have to catch you red handed receiving the goods. i also imagine if you one person buying say 5grams a week then thats not really what the cops are looking for is it? <br />what id really like to do is be able to buy small quanities every week and share them with my close mates, because where im from you cant find such good gear and such a good price. i just wondered if anyone knew of anybody that has had any real dramas or got into any trouble. cheers&nbsp;
