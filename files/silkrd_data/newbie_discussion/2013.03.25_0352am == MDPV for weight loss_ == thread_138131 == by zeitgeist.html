				Yes, friends and I have noticed having to go over in belt holes from weight loss. I lost 20 pounds in about 8 months with the occasional PV use. Not sure about dosage, I don&#039;t stop until the bags gone and with my skin left smelling like a meth lab. I&#039;ve heard MDPV is one of the active ingredients in qd8714&#039;s diet pills, which have good reviews, so I&#039;d assume they do pretty good for weight loss.

				Yes its a POTENT anorectic (appetite supressant) and also increases metabolism.<br /><br />But remember to come down and eat a meal rich in fat and protein and veggies... or you will go psychotic from lack of sleep and sustinence combined with forcing the brain to run at overdrive on empty fuel.

				I was hoping to revive this and am wondering about Ephedrine?<br />I&#039;ve never taken a weight loss supplement.<br />I have never tried it, and am curious if the side effects are worth the weight loss, if one would be able to not take it daily, and if you gain the weight easily back once off it?<br />Thanks, any help is appreciated!

				Follow-up, here&#039;s my &#039;review&#039; (of MDPV for appetite suppression and Silk Road vendors):<br /><br />The stories are true, MDPV is fiendishly addicting. Limit doses to 2x/day. Personally, I take 5mg before and after work, insufflated, and have lost 20lb in a month.<br /><br />At 5mg, a &#039;high&#039; lasts about 60-120 minutes. The high is difficult to describe, your linguistic skills may be a bit &#039;off.&#039;<br />Check out vendor&#039;s feedback or posts such as this:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95674.msg739593#msg739593<br /><br />A few tips:<br /><br />* Do NOT continuously re-dose. You&#039;ll want to, don&#039;t. Write sticky notes, get a time lock safe, etc.<br /><br />* Do NOT take an NDRI (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Cymbalta, Ritalin). MDPV *is* an NDRI.<br /><br />Vendors I&#039;ve ordered from:<br /><br />j1m1th1ng:<br />Recommend. Great communication and service. j1m1th1ng&#039;s MDPV is my first experience, so I cannot speak for product quality only service.<br /><br />qd8714:<br />First order of diet capsules delivered within 7 days. Second order, placed over 30 days ago, not received. <br /><br />Poor communication, dispute opened. He accepted resolution to reship (requesting address via PrivNote) but never read it/responded so I&#039;ve requested a refund. SR being up/down doesn&#039;t help. &#039;Ain&#039;t nobody got time for this.&#039;<br /><br />qd8714 if you&#039;re on here, contact me.<br /><br />nawlins:<br />Order shipped 12 days ago. Haven&#039;t received, contacted via TorChat. So, I&#039;ll update here later.<br /><br /><br />Those with questions pertaining to MDPV and weight loss, post!

				Leolo -&gt; Yes, but you&#039;ll need to know your tolerance. For me, it&#039;s 5mg.<br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t exceed your comfort threshold, you&#039;ll be fine. Start small, figure out what works for you. I&#039;ve never experienced &#039;shadow people&#039; or psychosis but, apparently, it&#039;s quite common at larger doses and if you smoke or IV it.

				I just received an unexpected gift in the mail, qd8714, must have reshipped as I received my goods!<br /><br />I will say his communication is a bit poor but he came through in the end, so I have to support that.
