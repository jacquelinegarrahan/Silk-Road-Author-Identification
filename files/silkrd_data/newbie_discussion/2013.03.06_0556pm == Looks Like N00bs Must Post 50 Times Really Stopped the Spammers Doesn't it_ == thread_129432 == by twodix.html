				&nbsp; Frunkly, thuckin sacarstic comment if you adn&#039;t all gissed by now. <br />The preceding comment has been made after having just noticed that every new forum topic is headed to the tune of;&nbsp; &#039;GIT RIPPED ORF FUCKEN HARD HERE! SHITT-HOT A-MAZING DEAL FOR YOU 30BTC FOR THE ASTOUNDUNGLY LOW, FUCK ALL PRICE OF MERELY JUST 21.00 USD AND ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I&#039;M WALT DISNEY AND SINCE I&#039;VE RECENTLY BEEN DEFROSTED BY GLOBAL WARMING I BOUGHT ALL A THESE HERE USELESSLY UNWANTED BY ME BTC&#039;S BACK IN THE DAYS OF WINDOWS 1959 WHEN ONE BTC WAS WORTH JUST A HANDFULL OF GREEN DUCK FEATHERS, ALL OF THE RED CARDS OF A G.I. ISSUED BATTLEFIELD-USE ONLY DECK OF PLAYING CARDS AND ONE LARGISH, SEMI-SPROUTED QUINCE-BOINTWELLE YELLOW DESSERT ONION!!! (WHICH I JUST FUCKING MADE UP),<br />And all of what you&#039;ve just read is, I&#039;&#039;m very sad to admit, enough to sucker someone into actually whipping out their credit card and even politely and apologetically going to all the trouble of giving the operator the little three digit code number on the back near the signature plate, so great is the state of human ignorance on this planet, and there certainly are enough gullible people here on this earth, (think about the state of the planet&#039;s governance and etc which is being run in a Jerry Seinfield ambivalence, Jim Morrisonesque nihilististic cynical narcisisitic hedonism e.g. &quot;I just wanna get my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames!&quot;, a&nbsp; planetary series of administrative &#039;movements&#039; deemed, in the half-blind half-asleep, half &#039;couldnae give a fuck&#039; morning train commuter&#039;s mind&#039;s eye sadly accepted, &#039;so-called, okay way of doing things&#039; for a sad example of people&#039;s general ignorance and gullibility and especially as an illustration as to the seriousness of this 50 post limit and its inability to stop these greedy little shits from reiterating their pea and shell game topic to fool the gullible over and over again.<br />A major review of the 50 post limit policy needs to take place. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Might I humbly suggest (and I hope that quarter oz reward&#039;s still goin!);&nbsp; to solve the spamming problem only let people with active selling accounts and persons whom they have had make actual purchases from their accounts, to the point of actual fulfillment of the sale, that is, (since if you check the list of&nbsp; available SR &#039;services&#039; someone with multiple bunk accounts will pepper your sales ratings with 5/5 shit hot glowing reports for a small BTC fee, so they&#039;ve got that scam loophole covered). <br />Make it a prerequisite that all legitimate sellers and authentic purchasers be allowed full privileges of posting topics and comments on the boards from the get go?&nbsp; <br />Even perhaps you could go all NAZI and fine people who prove themselves spamming cunts by skimming their accounts of, say say one BTC per offence or just plain closing their accounts and seizing their BTCs which sounds a whole lot simpler and vicious now I&#039;ve stopped noddin&#039; off<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a cop, I say in the truest of corporate owned,&nbsp; nuclear-powered, mechanical-monkey drum kit playing, and sometimes, (oops! nana sick puking), mindlessly-unrealized brain dead slogan-chirp regurgitating, shoulder-parrot squawking shit gibberishj, don&#039;t keep on with this failed experiment, act now, and in the words of that stone chick without any arms, legs facial features and a pair of useless stone wings,&nbsp; &#039;just do it.&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, as a cop and wanting to seriously fuck any n00bs from easily finding any useful advice that they really need to remain, or even to actually become secure users of SR, then putting a 50 post regulation would serve my purposes well in the;<br />A. slowing down of the learning process required to become a more elusive SR user who isn&#039;t going to make those mistakes we as cops need so much as clues that we can use to catch you all,<br />and; <br />B. Helping me to greatly centralize the major key target players on these forums that as a cop with limited funding, resources and time I need to be finding and fucking up the ass (in a bad way) this almost unstoppable SR thing in order to sabotage this potential free market tool of the black economy from inevitably through force of numbers becoming something that perhaps its creators envisaged originally for it to become one day. <br />&nbsp; In the future (at whatever speed that may be approaching) perhaps achieving, at status that is, being a future model for a time when human beings take from the administrations of the earth through their own unstoppable prowess in the from of devices such as SR, the right to experiment with their own consciousnesses by creating a model market structure, a level playing field of semi-reputable*, non-territorial based, gang violence and syndicate excluded chemical market place. Leading to&nbsp; perhaps one day, a globally legally endorsed drug dealing&nbsp; industry model market structure where freedom of information, harm minimization and resource access combine to entirely change the nature of the contemporary drug dealing economy so that it&#039;s no longer just another unfairtrade, big, fat, dirty, money pie for corrupt government officials to push their filthy fat fingers into, and for bloodthirsty warlords to swap highs for AKs to destroy women and children in the name of their version of &#039;freedom&#039;,&nbsp; and perhaps to finally stop being a place where the insane, sociopathic mega-rich, drug sodden zomboids of the earth bling-glare rule the muthah fucken waves and free crowds of yes-men addicts made up of human suck-holes who spend their every waking hour a slave to an entourage to a repulsive being whom they detest, just grovelling for another evil deed to fulfill to acquire the reward of that agonizingly craved fix, as inwardly they hate themselves and everything else that hhas or ever will exist in the entire universe . (Hey I just saved myself&nbsp; $175.00 at the psychiatrists office!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So anyway, I reckon your 50 post rule has failed and is playing the cops game for &#039;em, but hey whadda I know, I&#039;m just a junkie cunt?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Those measures I&#039;ve put forth must have some negative effect on spammers since I&#039;m here to buy drugs and you&#039;re here to sell &#039;em to me ,so we ain&#039;t gonna spend all day trying to rip the shit out of each other are we, after all, isn&#039;t that what the whole fucking clearnet is all about?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, it&#039;s really fucked when it takes you, as a 50 post limited n00b, literal days to hunt down half of one half arsed sort of relevant answer to a very serious security problem that could potentially bring both you and your seller unstuck when your drug addiction is driving you to extreme risk-taking behaviors, sadly, because it just doesn&#039;t conform its mode of action upon your body by the same slow process that hunting for the very much important and necessary to remain as &#039;safe&#039; (as can be) answer to your question does. <br /><br />Obviously as I&#039;m blathering shite I need to explain more. <br />If you&#039;re looking for an answer to a question because you&#039;re not confident to ask the question in the n00b section, then you might be caused to make a series of unsound decisions in regard to your security &#039;on a whim&#039; and &#039;just hoping for the best&#039; and all because someone&#039;s made up a rule that will supposedly stop spammers (which hasn&#039;t stopped them at all) <br />That&#039;s one reason to change the 50 post rule.

				Your post was so long that i stop reading it very quick..<br /><br />I have thought about this 50 post for noobs. One&nbsp; thing could be that you cant post more than 10 posts/day so your post could be checked that they aren&#039;t total carbage.&nbsp; The reason for it is obvious and i dont see it as too bad. I feel quite happy here :D<br /><br />If someone has something so&nbsp; important to tell s/he&nbsp; could make a new thread in newbie section, it surely will be noticed then. So&nbsp; stop bitching about the 50 post for noobs.&nbsp; <br /><br />But surely it haven&#039;t stopped the spammers so something else/more has to be done.<br /><br />-RealSal

				and imagine how clogged it would be if there wasn&#039;t a 50 post limit?<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mind the 50 posts.&nbsp; I started off using the spam threads to up the postcount then just kicked back and enjoyed paddling around in there.&nbsp; the newbie forum probably gets quicker replies to questions than any of the others.

				tl;dr<br />But the newbie section has helped against spam from scamsites. So it is better than nothing, but I believe there might be better solutions to the problem.
