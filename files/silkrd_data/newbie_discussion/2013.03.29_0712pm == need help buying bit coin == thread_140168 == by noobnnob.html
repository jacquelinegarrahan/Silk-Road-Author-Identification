				noobnnob,<br />&nbsp;The one thing that you should always keep in mind is that the purchase of btc is not illegal. At least not yet. Most of the time, the advise that I give about purchasing btc basically breaks down as follows.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Choose your method of purchase (ie,MtGox, BitInstant, Blue Sky Traders, etc.)<br />&nbsp; Make your purchase<br />&nbsp; Send your coins through 3 wallets at Blockchain.info<br />&nbsp;<br />At the next step you have to decide for yourself how comfortable you are and the risk you are willing to take. After your coins clear your 3rd wallet you can either send them to your SR account or you can put them through Bitcoin Fog. If you choose to use Bitcoin Fog, know that it takes minimum of six hours for your coins to be dispersed to your SR account. Put them in the night before you want to use them and wake up the next morning with them in your account ready for whatever you want to do with them. <br />&nbsp;I have used the fog on larger buys and skipped it on smaller ones or when I was in a hurry. This is ultimately your choice. In my opinion, the more paranoid you are, the safer you will be. The fog does charge a random fee of 1-3% of your deposit amount. Not much to ask to keep you safe. Hope this helps....<br /><br />Hers a link:&nbsp; &nbsp; fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion
