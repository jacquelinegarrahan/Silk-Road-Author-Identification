				Am familiar (or was) with PGP back in the 1990&#039;s. But I am stumped on how to start a vender acct. SR wants 5+ BC to start.<br />Do I need to purchase BC with legal currency somewhere and then transfer it to SR?<br />I like most am &quot;Cash poor&quot; so coming up with $1500. US is not going to happen anytime soon. Was hoping to sell on SR to start earning BC. <br />I understand the idea of creating a &quot;escrow&quot; account (assuming that&#039;s what the 5BC is to start, or is it a payoff to the Dread Pirate Roberts for just the account.)<br />Or can I find a current vender who will sell my legal (non drug) items and take a cut allowing me to be a start-up.<br />I just have some new excess office supply inventory (ink) I would like to sell and ebay is just not doing it.

				How about opening an online ink store at one of those web sites hosting bitcoin-only transactions?&nbsp; That way, you wouldn&#039;t have to hassle with converting $ to -, HEY, how come there isn&#039;t a bitcoin symbol on my keyboard???

				No real way besides putting the money up bro...gotta pay to play. There used to be ( a couple years ago) when anyone could vend scammers that would switch names every couple weeks and get tons of people...That&#039;s when the fees started. I used to vend back then under a diff name and never paid a fee, surprised it&#039;s so high now.

				no offense but if you don&#039;t know how to get btc, do you really think you should jump into having a vendor account...? yes you have to buy btc with legal currency, and you should transfer it to sr in a way that keeps you anon, especially if you want to be a vendor. You should aslo beef up ur security bigtime because vendors are the main targets of LE on here. learn how to use truecrypt, or use tails or liberte from a live usb.. have you even thought about how you would turn the btc you make back into legal currency in your country? thats one of the hardest steps to do safely.<br />pgp isnt completely safe, especially for vendors who use the same one frequently, the header keys can be used to figure out who you are. look at Pine&#039;s posts in the security forums. Those are great guides for those interested in being vendors

				If you can&#039;t come up with how to get BTC or come up with $500 then you shouldn&#039;t be vending.
