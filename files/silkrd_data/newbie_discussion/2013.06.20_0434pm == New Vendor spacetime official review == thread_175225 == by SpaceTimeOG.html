				UPDATE 2013/08/05:&nbsp; WE&#039;RE BACK!&nbsp; Starting off small with two lotteries, excellent odds-<br /><br />Scratch off-&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/428a3fb78b<br /><br />bk-MDMA lottery (1:7 chances with 3 prizes!):&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b78fd94d18<br /><br />It&#039;s cool to be back, cats&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />~ST<br /><br /><br /><br />UPDATE 2013/07/10:&nbsp; Well, the chemist for spacetime recently dropped out.&nbsp; Which means we can no longer offer DMT.&nbsp; We&#039;ll still have some harmalas left for a little bit, and Methylone.&nbsp; But unless something changes soon, we may have to close up shop for a while (I say we, it&#039;s pretty much a one man show at the moment).<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who made this possible for me, it was brilliant.&nbsp; I hope this is not &quot;the end&quot;, but rather a new opportunity.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep anyone still interested updated here and on the seller page as to whether or not we intend to close up shop.<br /><br />A million times, thank you and much love from spacetime!<br /><br />UPDATE 2013/07/08:&nbsp; Had a bit of a scare, and almost lost my life.&nbsp; Rest assured, all orders were sent out today and anyone who was made to wait (you know who you are) will receive compensation if you should choose to order through us.<br /><br />Also, we have added Methylone.&nbsp; We tried crushing up the rocks in order to increase stealth, but just know that whatever you receive IS NEVER STEPPED ON.&nbsp; EVER.<br /><br />If you have any questions about the quality, find a way to test it or ask us, but the answer will always be the same.&nbsp; Get it while it&#039;s hot, we&#039;re stepping up our game here and you won&#039;t be disappointed ;)<br /><br />Hey there, all!&nbsp; We&#039;re spacetime and we&#039;d like to rock your world.<br /><br />We&#039;re a brand new vendor here on the Road.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been buying for longer than any of us can remember and are excited to bring what we&#039;ve got to the table.<br /><br />All samples have been sent, most received so far.&nbsp; From the replies coming in, it seems&nbsp; like everything&#039;s going brilliantly!<br /><br />We&#039;ve even got a few paying customers so far (the first to order got a generous extra helping).&nbsp; All shipments will either be on point or overweight.<br /><br />Sorry to everyone I couldn&#039;t include for whatever reason.&nbsp; Keep a lookout, though, we do intend to offer international samples in the near-future, a few of which being sent domestically, just for funsies.<br /><br />What Time is it?<br />~SpaceTime!<br /><br />

				Fantastic, glad to see interest is *finally* picking up&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />We&#039;re sending all samples placed before noon tomorrow out at the same time, First-Class.&nbsp; <br /><br />And a reminder, since I just got a question asking, this is Freebase DMT and smokeable harmalas, two separate products.&nbsp; This is not a changa infusion or pharmauasca.&nbsp; We recommend smoking it in a machine if you&#039;re combining it with the DMT.&nbsp; The DMT is, of course, smokeable too :P<br /><br />

				First off thanks Spacetime for the free sample. The shipping time/stealth were great, shipped Friday received Monday. I&#039;ve never smoked DMT before so nothing to compare it too and it&#039;s kind of hard to explain the trip. However his gear is good and 100% legit and very great prices and amounts would order again from Spacetime.&nbsp;

				Just received it. DMT smells great. Shipping time was good and stealth was excellent. Will edit this post later when I get a chance to smoke it tonight. Say, should I smoke the MAOI or just take it orally? Also thanks a ton for the sample! You da man, SpaceTime.

				Stopping in to thank spacetime for my sample!!!<br /><br />The shipping and communication was great!!! Spacetime messaged me after i placed the order and once it was shipped,&nbsp; giving me a better since of security.. enuff said <br /><br />Now the product!!!&nbsp; I really loved the Full Spectrum, Iv tried DMT from all over the place but only once from SR and that was from jor, I loaded up 25mg of the full spectrum lastnight and its very good stuff.. its been a few months since iv smoked dmt and i felt like this experiences reset me.. I didnt have a break through but still enjoyed ever min of it!!!&nbsp; dmt is kindda like crack to me, once i start i just wont more and more, so i ended up vaping the other 25mg and smoking the harmalas throughout the night. <br /><br />Ill defiantly be back to buy some next time i get some coins and try to wright a proper trip report...But spacetime is legit and his products are great!!

				My apologies for the delay. Ended up working some extra shifts and got distracted. Here&#039;s my review:<br /><br />I chose not to smoke the MAOI. I used to take a MAOI for depression and it would intensify trips a little too much for me. Did a lot for depression though.<br /><br />The DMT smelled like good DMT. I made a light bulb pipe instead of my usual method (pack it in a bowl with cannabis). Turns out this wasn&#039;t the best idea with my terrible coordination. The DMT smoked really well and didn&#039;t stink as much as I remember. Because I didn&#039;t inhale enough I didn&#039;t break through, BUT the quality is good and I&#039;m considering buying more to make some pharmahuasca. The trip lasted about 20 minutes and the visuals were beautiful. I have these LED Christmas lights up in my room and the reflections on the wall turned into these floating orbs that swirled around me. I ended up resolving some personal issues and admitting to things I couldn&#039;t admit to before. When I came down I was considerably less anxious and was able to focus a bit better. When I woke up this mining I felt super fresh and well rested.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad I saw SpaceTime&#039;s listing. He/she has the potential to become a great vendor. No complaints here. Thanks, man!
