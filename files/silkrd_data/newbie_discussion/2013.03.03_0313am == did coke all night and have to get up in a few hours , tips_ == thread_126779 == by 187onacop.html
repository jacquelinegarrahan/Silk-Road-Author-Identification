				Having been there many times before I can really empathise with you, take a big deep breath, lock the coke away, make a cup of tea, and listen to some calming music. If you want to stop doing it you&#039;ve got to have some self control and change your mindset, keep telling yourself the party is over and it&#039;s pointless carrying on. Smoke a heavy indica, if you do that and have got some to hand, it should help. Mind over matter and you&#039;ll be fine :)

In the morning when you wake up have something small to eat with some orange juice, drink plenty of water throughout the day too to flush it out, get one of those little inhalers too (if your in the UK olbas or vicks make them), treat yourself gently tomorrow and apart from this meeting don&#039;t overexert yourself, when you get home tomorrow increase you&#039;re sleep by 30%, you&#039;ll be back to normal the next day.

				Go lay in a dark room until 45 mins before you need to leave for meeting. try and think of nothing as you lay there and rest your eyes. body, and mind. Get up, have a couple of lines, have a nice hot shower, some coffee, and some food. Make yourself look good so you can look in the mirror and feel good about yourself. As you leave try very hard to simply focus on this meeting, try and only think of it but also try and relax - everything will be fine. When you get home, smoke ALOT of weed.

				If it were me and I only had a couple hours I wouldn&#039;t dare try to sleep if that is even possible. If I did manage it I would never get up for the meeting. Liquids, try to eat something, and just get through it. Buck up Sally and just keep telling yourself the reward is rest when you get home then get out of there as soon as you can. Best of luck.

				I find Modafinil and/or Armodafinil are good for this situation where you did coke too long and now have to stay up for a while the next day. Modafinil usually comes in 200mg, try 100mg first before you use the full 200.

				I you should always have Valium/Ativan on hand.&nbsp; It will kill the buzz of coke or other drugs, speedy ones especially.<br /><br />&nbsp; Antipsychotics (zyprexa , seroquel) will stop a bad trip or psycadelic madness.<br /><br />Ritalin, speed, adderall, will get you up if you can&#039;t&nbsp; function or seriously hung over .&nbsp; Don&#039;t take too much or to will be flying again.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can score OTC versions of these a any 24h pharmacy. <br />&nbsp;Sudafed/decongestant = speed.<br />Benadryl or gravol = downer<br />Advil for pain.&nbsp; In Canada we can ask the pharmacist for Tylenol #1 with 15mg of codeine.&nbsp; Only one per customer and you sign a book and show ID.&nbsp; <br /><br />For god sake put it away and definitely don&#039;t do more before you meet sober people .&nbsp; You&#039;ll reek like all night party man if you don&#039;t shower well.<br /><br /><br />
