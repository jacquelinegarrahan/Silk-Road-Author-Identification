				Hello, first of all sorry if my english is bad, i don&#039;t speak english very good but i&#039;ll try to do my best effort to write this review.<br /><br />Well my first order from Emerald was Pakistani TMAX like 5 months ago. 0,5 overweight.<br />When you put the fire next to the hash, it begins to do bubbles, taste.. for me very delicious, smooth and floreal, very delicate.<br />I don&#039;t remember good the colour but i think the hash was colour dark brown, too much sticky!<br />The high very pleasant and potent, in short words, very nice hash, very recommended TOP QUALIY<br /><br />My last order from him was Culero, weeks ago.<br />It&#039;s adverticed like eggs of &quot;5gr&quot; but mine was 6g. thank you emerald<br />When you put the fire next to the hash, it begins to do bubbles too obviously and more bubbles than the TMAX! the hash seems it will exploit like a bomb when you&#039;re heating with the fire haha<br />The bundle was awful obvious haha but when the film is off the hash, you see that veryyyyy dark hash, toooo much sticky, more than the TMAX too!!! and you say fuckkkkkk my brain the next days :p hahah<br />The flavor exquisite like TMAX, although I think TMAX&#039;s a little more flowery and i like that!.<br /><br />undoubtedly i recommend this seller. the stealth is very good and the postage options are very very good, express shipping too!<br /><br />he is very friendly and communicative.&nbsp; :)

				I`m also writing a review for Emeralds Culero Hash. <br />Order was confirmed quick, delivered in four days(EU). It was about a half gram overweight like said and very nice hash!<br />Very resinous, hard when temperature is about twenty Â°C, melts away in your hands if warmed um a little or higher room temperature:-)<br />will definitely order again, very trusted seller.
