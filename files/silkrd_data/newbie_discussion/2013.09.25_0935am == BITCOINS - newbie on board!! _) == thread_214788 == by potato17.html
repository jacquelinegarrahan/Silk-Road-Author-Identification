				So, I am new here (obviously) and I&#039;ve got tor and a bitcoin wallet, only thing is I dont have is bitcoins&nbsp; :P If I&#039;ve got it right i will use bitcrow/escrow when buying things but I obviously need bitcoins first, so my question is how do I get bitcoins in a (relatively) safe way if I don&#039;t have an account to transfer money from?<br /><br />can I find somebody that will take cash in exchange for bitcoins? <br />-and follow up question on that: does the escrow/bitcrow thingy work in that scenario aswell?&nbsp; :) <br /><br />kind regards potato17&nbsp; ;D

				Find a bit coin exchange, the ones I use is usually bank deposit, so I do a buy order they give me an account number etc and a reference and then I go to the bank they choose and deposit money wait 1 to 4 hours and I have my bitcoins. I think that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking.

				set up an account at http://localbitcoins.com, then click on buy bitcoins link at the top of the page. they will list all bitcoin sellers that are in your country, first list is usually the sellers that use bank transfer, bank deposits and other online payments. there will be another list directly underneath that lists sellers that will meet you in person and sell you btc for cash. the sellers that meet you in person do tend to be quite a bit more expensive than the online payment ones. i guess they got to factor in travel costs and time spent meeting people tho.<br /><br />if you are too paranoid to do a bank transfer then just do an over the counter cash deposit. this just involves writing down the sellers account number and stuff, then going to your local branch of his bank. you just give the bank teller the account info, reference number and cash and she will pay it straight into the sellers account. it goes in instantly and you are not asked for any info or ID at all.<br /><br />just make absolutely sure that you write the sellers account number, sort code and the reference number down exactly and clearly. quadruple check it to be on the safe side because if the money gets paid into a wrong account then you are very unlikely to be able to get it back again.<br /><br />also for cash deposits you have to take into account that a localbitcoins transaction has a time limit of 90 minutes before it is automatically cancelled, so you will need to be able to get to the bank, make the deposit and get to a computer to mark the payment complete within 90 minutes.<br /><br />might be best to message the seller to make sure he is online and ready to make the transaction, and that he is going to stay online for the time it will take you to get to the bank and back. you can only message them when you make an offer, but you can always make an offer just to message them and then cancel that offer and start a new one if need be. just mention you are doing this in the message so the seller knows what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />localbitcoins is so easy and pretty much safe to use if you make sure you only use sellers that have the (100/100) feedback score next to their names. everytime i&#039;ve done a cash deposit the btc has been in my lbtc wallet by the time i got home.<br /><br />good luck

				I just found this on Localbitcoin.com.&nbsp; It might not affect us Newbies at the moment but it is food for thought and possibly worth following.&nbsp; I am new to this so if anyone can repost this somewhere useful if you think it&#039;s needed then please do so.&nbsp; For me the thought of turning over more then, or anywhere near £79k is but a distant dream<br /><br /><br />I have been in lengthy discussions with HMRC as of late to clarify bitcoins situation with regards to our tax laws. Today I received a letter reversing an earlier ruling they made saying that we are required to pay the full 20% VAT rate for bitcoins sold if the turnover is over £79,000 per year, effectively rendering the UK bitcoin economy inoperable at such prices. This effects both buyers and sellers, over 90% of bitcoin sales in the UK is between myself and several of the other major vendors of the site who easily turnover in excess of £79,000 and unless they are pricing the sales including VAT, both buyer and seller are thereby responsible for the tax evasion.<br /><br />I have already rallied on HMRC with a damning letter that they will be handing over market control to tax evaders and criminals but as of now all sellers above the threshold are committing a crime so I can only encourage you to be extremely careful about your activities as HMRC are currently investigating not only localbitcoins, but the bitcoin economy at large.<br /><br />
