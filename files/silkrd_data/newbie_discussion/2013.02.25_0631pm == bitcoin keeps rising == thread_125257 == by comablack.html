				Bitcoins are trading more like a commodity right now; as in supply vs demand.&nbsp; As more people learn about the &quot;value&quot; of the BTC there is an explosion in the demand and a fixed supply meaning a jump in price.&nbsp; Once something goes wrong (like maybe a person/corporation with a lot of money slowly buying up millions of $$ in BTC&#039;s then dumping them on the market to make quick money) then you may see the price drop by factors of 10 as loads of BTC&#039;s hit the market.&nbsp; The good news is that many of the vendors on SR base their prices on local currency (now: 1g H = 8.8 BTC = $300 6mos ago: 1g H = 75 BTC = $300).<br /><br />The best example that I can thing of is the apparent &quot;explosion&quot; in gold prices.&nbsp; The problem is that Gold has been worth the same amount for hundreds of years.&nbsp; For example If I went to a tailor in NYC and bought a top of the line custom suit in 1850 it may have cost me ~$20.00, but that was when when Gold was trading at ~$10/oz.&nbsp; If I go to NYC today and buy a custom suit it may cost me $4000.00 but now Gold is trading at $2000/oz.&nbsp; Even though the cost of the suit seems to have increased quite a bit it actually hasn&#039;t changed at all.<br /><br />FYI FUCK the FED (Federal Reserve)!

I have only a couple of hundred dollars in bitcoin, and it&#039;s nice to see them going up -- future drugs will cost less! -- but eventually there will be a crash, or local governments will clamp down and either extinguish bitcoin, or put on so many restrictions that it&#039;s unusable.

				Bitcoins will continue to rise in value until SR encounters some form of problem. I have to imagine that the majority of the driving force of bitcoin prices is SR, as SR becomes more popular/well known prices increase. If in some nightmarish circumstance SR is completely compromised, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see bitcoin prices drop to the $5 mark like they were a while ago.
