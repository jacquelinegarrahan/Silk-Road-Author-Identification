				I found a free sample being advertised on SR.&nbsp; It said you have to pay for postage, but to post in UK is free because it&#039;s domestic.&nbsp; However, there&#039;s no option to pick free UK postage, so surely I&#039;d have to pay anyway? Plus, on the item page it actually says that it costs a small amount for the &#039;free&#039; sample.&nbsp; This can&#039;t be legit can it?<br /><br />(Would post the link but it&#039;s a limited offer, however the fact that it&#039;s still on SR indicates to me further that it&#039;s a scam)

				Honestly, tossing a vendor a few Satoshis for free drugs sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Keep in mind it&#039;s not just the cost of a stamp but also the time a vendor has to put into packaging the order. Unless shipping is oddly expensive you&#039;re probably getting pretty cheap drugs, and shouldn&#039;t be complaining.

				I would do this too for samples, it proves that the person getting the sample might have some capacity to order more as soon as they get it / try it. Giving drugs to some 13 year old who made an account, but couldn&#039;t fund it doesn&#039;t sound like a fun time either...

				Very rarely will you find samples that are completely free. Remember, a lot of the vendors include the packaging costs as part of the postage fee. So you&#039;ll be charged for envelopes, baggies/MBB, capsules and so on. Honestly, I don&#039;t see how a few euros/dollars wouldn&#039;t be worth a sample since it&#039;s still usually cheaper than buying off the street. Sample of 1g of weed or a 200mg mdma cap for $3 on SR? Or $10 from your dealer?<br /><br />From my experience here, you should stay away from the samples that are completely free (or like 0.01 btc), as those vendors are usually LE or address harvesters, especially if they don&#039;t use PGP.<br />

				Ok cheers, I wasn&#039;t complaining really that there was a slight cost, I just wanted to make sure that it looked legit, never asked for a sample before
