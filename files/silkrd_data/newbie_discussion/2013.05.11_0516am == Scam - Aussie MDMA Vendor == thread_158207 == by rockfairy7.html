				Hi guys,<br />Thought I would share this with the newbie community hopefully save you the same drama. Brought an 8 ball of molly back in January from &quot;Neon lights&quot; who I had previously had several good transactions and received quality products. This was for personal use with a couple of friends of mine, and in the 8 ball were some very large rocks (biggest 8 points, next 5 and so on with lots of smaller ones). Naturally we saved the big rocks till last and rolled on the smaller crushed powder which was decent. Well we have got to last, and my friends came round for dinner last night to break the bad news to me. That sketchy cunt &quot;Neon Lights&quot; had got some large rocks of sugar and heated them up so that they were tacky and rolled in the MDMA powder so that on initial inspection they look like large rocks of molly. Crunched the fuckers between my teeth, no mixing up that molly/sugar taste. Now I sifted through the forums and found out he has just cleaned house in Feb, done a runner. Very disappointed as had several dealings with and exchanged many polite msgs with him and thought I had built some level of re-pour with him. Not delusional in thinking he was my best mate, just wondering how much quick cash it takes to turn a good vendor bad? Anyway hope my story serves warning to some of you and above all check your rocks, give em a scratch to make sure not a large sugar rock underneath. Since I have hung onto this for so long the rocks have fully dried and the powder just falls now. Don&#039;t pay $750 for 3.5g for something that costs $2 a kilo at the supermarket like me and finally Neon Lights i know your out there, I hope you get cancer fucker.<br />rockfairy

				Any recommendations, have tried a couple of times and all ways got no show packages. Not sure if I was being selectively scammed cause I am an Aussie or customs got them. PM me if you not comfortable post this sort of info.

It was suprising it got here actually because the stealth was almost non-existant and straight from netherlands.. Goes to show what might actually be happening to the missing packs coming to australia. But if i were you I would have a look at the UK sellers, bloody good prices and I think their stealth is a little ahead of most europe md vendors I can&#039;t vouch for anyone right now, but i have an order from a UK vendor and a german vendor at the moment. If you&#039;re still around i&#039;ll tell you how I go bud
