				Coke, H, Crack, and Crystal are all pretty expensive (imo) compared to the street prices<br /><br />u can find weed cheap for wholesale, but weed concentrates/oils/hash are pretty expensive unless you want hash mids... pills i&#039;m not too sure of<br /><br />lsd/shrooms are around the street value price (shrooms maybe a little cheaper)<br /><br />oh and dmt is pretty expensive<br /><br />overall the most over priced item is crack, considering it&#039;s so much cheaper in real life... but crack is wack

				Depends on how the venders get their supply.<br /><br />&nbsp;I could imagine that coke and meth vendors get their product from trafficking organizations and those groups have pretty wild expenses (street muscle, mules, bribes, lawyers, weapons, risk, buying the product from the producer). It would be ignorant to say the cost of those groups&#039; expenses don&#039;t get passed onto customers on SR. Then you have to include the vender&#039;s time spend packaging and shipping product. Unless you live next to and know the producer, expect a far heftier price.<br /><br />&nbsp;Drugs like weed, mushrooms, and other easily produced goods can cut out the trafficker, thus passing wild savings to customers when the vendor produces the product them/him/hers/self. All you would pay for would be shipping, materials, producer and packaging wages.

				I noticed that although the pill prices seem awfully steep and set in stone (not much undercutting going on), they are roughly on par with prices you can obtain by shopping around on various online pharmacies.&nbsp; &nbsp; The added benefit here (for US shoppers, for example) is that you can source your meds internally and not have to be subject to the whims of Customs or dealing with dodgy overseas quality control.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know a goddamn thing about trying to source RX meds (or just about anything) on the street.&nbsp; The Internet has almost made this a thing of the past.&nbsp; I think it would be very interesting to create a FAQ dedicated to buying shit on the street...I know it&#039;s at odds with what the SR is about...but there&#039;s no other obvious place to talk about this...and we have the knowledge base here to create something pretty definitive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just an idea........ 8)

				I voted crack, just because crack is supposed to be cheap, but seriously the pills are ridiculous, at least the opiates and Adderall are.&nbsp; I remember getting 30mg IR on the street a few years ago for $4 a pop.&nbsp; Hell a few years ago, I used to get Opana 10mg IR for $6, but I know that was just a really good deal.&nbsp; Roxies used to be as cheap as $10, but no more than $15 for a 30 a few years ago and now where I live they are over $40 and Diladid 8mg is $25-$30.&nbsp; When I do opiates, I usually just go with H if it is halfway decent at $20 a bag or 3 for $50.&nbsp; The cheapest I saw 8mg D&#039;s so far on here was $24 a pop for 5 including shipping, but damn they only get me high for a few hours a pop.&nbsp; The weed and psychedelics and usually the MDMA seems pretty reasonable to me though for the most part, just as long as it is legit, the prices usually don&#039;t seem too bad.&nbsp; Especially LSD or DMT; I can&#039;t find that on the street and I am not making it, so if I pay $10-$15 for 120ug or so of LSD that is not too bad even with shipping on top of it; if it is a legit source, then the next time I can save by ordering 10 or so tabs; that&#039;d last me a while.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like LSD is something you do more than a couple times a month.&nbsp; My main thing is getting medical weed to always have to smoke everyday and be medicated 24/7 and I have seen some legit, quality looking vendors with reasonable deals, cheaper than the street and I don&#039;t even know anyone on the street at the moment anyway worth my money.&nbsp;

				Certainly the coke is overpriced. I can&#039;t seem to stomach paying more than 100 dollars a gram or 300 a ball, even for awesome quality. Oxy seems quite pricey as well.
