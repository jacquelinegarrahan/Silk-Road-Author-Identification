				Mu configuration is window7 desktop pc. How can I prevent my computer from being proved that tor was used. To be more precise how to delete event log permanently in windows? If I open events and click clear on each chosen log is it enough? Or should I also clean the register?<br />Basically what should I do, if not destroy the hard drive. I know that using tor is not a crime and nobody will know what i used it for, but it&#039;s still an evidence. Of course before all I will delete tor with something like file shredder.<br />Thank you.

				Keep your torbrowser.exe file on a small USB, the whole Browser Bundle I mean, along with any PGP keys and applications of that nature. <br /><br />Download CCleaner for free from ccleaner.com . This is an application that makes it easy to clean up the registry and get rid of temporary internet / log files files. <br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t hurt to do a wipe and reload the hard drive operating system about every six months to a year to keep the operating system running smooth but that&#039;s just a maintenance issue.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I can think of at the moment. But you&#039;re good. Stay safe.

				Get a copy of wipe drive. Wipe it using DOD specs. Then reinstall freshly from your install disks. And don&#039;t use it again for tor purposes. Put tails&gt;tor on a dvdr or cdr. No possiblity of anything being written or saved to them. Or like previous poster said, usb, easier to destroy, but also easy to lose.

				USB would be the best way to go but that is just my personal opinion. Theres alot of guides out there if you look around.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bluehorn
