				Tomorrow will be fully one month since I placed an order from Eric Cartman and I have received nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication is not great, but could be worse.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see that others have had exceptionally long wait times with this vendor, but a month? I&#039;m starting to wonder if some of the (little) feedback he has isn&#039;t fake.&nbsp;

				Bought a gram from CapeCrusader, received the product in 12 days, delivered to the EU.<br /><br />Products looks fine, white/slighly yellow powder, almost completely dry. Dont have a scale so can&#039;t comment on the weight. <br /><br />As for the effects of the drug, I don&#039;t have any previous experiences with speed so can&#039;t compare the quality, but for what it&#039;s worth;<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have a scale, so started with very small line and waited to see where it got me. After sniffing a couple of very small lines I got a nice buzz going. The stuff isn&#039;t bad on the nose imo, a slight burn for a couple seconds, kinda enjoyed it :p The drip wasn&#039;t bas either. <br />Experienced an energy rush and some euphoria. Felt very clearheaded, noticed an increase in focus, normally I&#039;m easily disctracted but now I could focus on tasks with ease. The energy was mainly in my head, the product was very easy on my body. Did have tense yaws and wide eyes, also a bit dilated pupils. All in all the feeling of this speed was very enjoyable.<br />In about 1-1,5 hours after the last dose, the energy rush seemed to die down. Was still very awake tho, just no energy rush or euphoria anymore. Redosed a couple of times. The only negative thing I noticed when using this speed was that I was having very cold hands and overall felt pretty cold. Turning up the heat didn&#039;t help much.<br />Checked my resting pulse between doses a couple times, was at 80-100 most of the time, and at 120 after a relative big line. I checked this just out of curiousity, I never felt my heart beating hard or anything. Stopped redosing after 7 hours from the start.<br /><br />Started this experiment at 11:00 and stopped around 18:00. Felt the urge to redose but didn&#039;t know yet how I would react to speed sleep wise, and didn&#039;t want to risk a sleepless night, so didn&#039;t redose. Wasn&#039;t hungry at all, but felt an emptyness in my stumach so forced myself to eat a meal. At 03:00 I was still awake, feeling kinda tired but awake at the same time. Suspecting I would lie awake if I would go to bed in this state, I popped a 5mg valium and 0,5mg xanax and a glass of wine, fell asleep in minutes without any troubles. Slept for 7 hours, feeling fine the day after, no hangover whatsoever, maybe a tiny bit groggy but that might just as well came from the benzo&#039;s.

				I am planning to buy from BoyMaster for its good reviews. Although he is double the price of other vendors, but he sells powder and no wet paste. Thats a big plus.<br />
