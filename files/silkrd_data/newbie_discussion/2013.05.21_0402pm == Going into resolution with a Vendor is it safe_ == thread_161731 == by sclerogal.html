No vendor will risk losing their account by threatening a buyer - one who tried to do that recently, &quot;liston&quot;, was suspended and nothing more came of it. If a vendor threatens you in any way whatsoever report it immediately to one of the mods here and we will see that an investigation takes place and the vendor is dealt with if the need should arise.<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Libertas.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t threaten.&nbsp; I had a question since this is a sticky subject not on the wiki for us newbies.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure you know the vendor I have in question and it&#039;s correct to say that Vendor is active with other products.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m not the only resolution case for this one.&nbsp;

				Anythings possible i guess, Best thing you can do , and that I have done is try to be as polite and cool headed as possible and talk to the vendor let him know you&nbsp; are a reasonable guy and just want whats fair for both parties.&nbsp; and hope hes as reasonable as you<br /><br />Really the best way to protect yourself against this is to research vendors as best as possible (easier said then done sometimes when the best deal is a new vendor youve never dealt with ) and try not to deal with any loose cannons (again easier said then done as scammers are polite and sincere as they come at first)
