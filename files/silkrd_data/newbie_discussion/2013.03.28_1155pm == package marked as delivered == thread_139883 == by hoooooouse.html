				title says it all. i check the tracking # and it says delivered 3 days ago. what should i do from this point? call my apartment complex? call the post office? I did a little research on packages being marked as delivered and a lot of people say that they call the post office, they admit they made a mistake, and are able to get the package back. but i don&#039;t know, that sounds... risky?<br /><br />please, any help is appreciated.

				I&#039;m in the same boat. Today I had a package delivered but it wasnt to where it should have been. While I HATE to lose nearly $300 I&#039;m just not calling the PO. Hopefully whoever got it will just put it back in the box tomorrow. <br /><br />Sorry for your loss.

				Damn. At least my order wasn&#039;t as big as yours. I really hope yours shows up, that will really suck if it doesn&#039;t!<br /><br />After searching the forums a bit more, it seems like this has happened a lot in the last few weeks. Interesting...

				If you can maybe get someone else to call from a payphone, I would assume those calls are recorded. You know, just in case its contents get discovered.<br /><br />You think they would do anything to someone if they got someone elses mail delivered by mistake then opened it and found drugs and reported it to the police? Opening someone elses mail is a crime to right? lol

				That&#039;s what i was thinking. If it was illegal to open someone&#039;s package, why would they turn themselves in. I think they would just throw it out or use it. but i don&#039;t know if they still could get in trouble for that if they did turn it in..
