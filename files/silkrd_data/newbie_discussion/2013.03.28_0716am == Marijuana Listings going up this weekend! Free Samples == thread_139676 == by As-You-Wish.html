				I am going to be adding Marijuana to my list of goods for sale and need your guy&#039;s input! Should I go with an Indica or Sativa strain? The price per OZ will be right around $190 regardless of which type of weed i get.<br />I have the shipping down and am all set up with mylar and vacuum sealing equipment.<br /><br /><br />I am going to need 4 reputable forum members to try out my new product. I will be offering 1 gram samples to forum members that would be willing to try my stuff out and leave a review.&nbsp; Any Takers?

				Been a member for a while with several transactions under my belt. Just started to post to get full posting abilities and also by chance decided to check out info on marijuana to lean me in the right direction. I think it would be helpful to have fresh input from someone who&#039;s opinion won&#039;t be swayed by past experiences. This way you have opinions from both ends of the smokers field. If you decide to let me try it out, I will in turn give you my honest review of it along with stealth and my whole experience dealing with you from start to finish. If you decide not to then I would like to wish you the best of luck on SR and hope you get great reviews. Peace.

				Hello,<br /><br />I am placing an order. If you see my stats and they suffice, then awesome. If you have reservations, it&#039;s understood, and a cancellation is in order.<br /><br />Question: Does a cancellation hurt my purchase rep as a buyer?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />surmer

				Not quite a vet...<br /><br />...but I enjoy mid-grade to Chronic. Price is an issue. I&#039;ve bought from several vendors, and post reviews for my favorites. $ and potency. Taste and intoxication.<br /><br />Profitable vendors approach every scope of the market. Sensimilla... (top shelf). Trim (mid grade)... seeds: mid-to-low grade.... Generally, I avoid &quot;low grade&quot; because it becomes difficult to distinguish from RCs.
