				&nbsp;Why is it, that long after being marked in transit, my silk road orders don&#039;t show up for days.<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s bad enough that vendors start saying they only ship a couple of times a week ( they give a line of bullshit about this being for safety to prevent LE watching the mailbox, but that is bollocks--only a moron would use the same post office/post box on a regular basis or even post a single days order all in one box)<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve got an order, with a vendor who ships on specific days. He advertises a cutoff time to get your order if placed on a shipping day. I ordered with hours to spare, my order was marked in transit on Wednesday, and here I am on Saturday still waiting.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not the UK mail system,&nbsp; I have had 5 orders sent from ebay, all sent 1st class on the same day as my SR order and on Thursday and Friday and every single one of these has turned up, but my Coke is still nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t limited to one vendor, I have had the same shit from another one, who I decided not to use anymore. I used this vendor and got my order next day(after marking in transit) last time.<br />&nbsp;Frankly, if you can&#039;t be arsed to do a mail run every weekday, you shouldn&#039;t be vending. If you have so many orders that you can&#039;t keep up, then you should get some help, or close your listings to new customers/take them into stealth mode, or quit vending.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think my order has even been sent yet, everything I ordered from ebay has showed up, it is only my SR order that is regularly conveniently delayed in the post.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would be able to cancel my order and take my money elsewhere if he hadn&#039;t marked it in transit--this is a shitty trick, it is the internet equivalent of the local dealer telling you he will be there in 10 minutes-every 30 minutes for 6 hours.<br />&nbsp;Will not be using this vendor again, which is a shame as the Coke was good last time.&nbsp; I only ordered this time because my go to guy didn&#039;t have a listing up, that guy always comes through next day if I get my order in before his cutoff.<br />&nbsp; Slack motherfuckers.
