				Howdy SR family. I am not one to quickly call out a vendor. I am curious if anyone else has ordered some bunk phentermine from mdpro? The stash we received is not in fact phentermine at all. I have messaged him in regards to this and he has read my message yet no response. It has been over 24 hours since it was read. <br />I have not read anything bad about mdpro on the forums which was one of the reasons we ordered from him, unless there is something I have not found in my forum searches. <br />Really kind of a bummer to spend over a $100 and get a bag of speckled chalk. <br />I even offered to return the product minus the one pill we used for testing. <br /><br />If anyone could help steer me in the right direction to get this straight I would greatly appreciate it.

Have never had a problem. Haven&#039;t ordered the phentermine. Xanax, oxycontin, and adderall. The adderall didn&#039;t do anything. I only bought 5, but they were the 30mg IR. I think it&#039;s because i have had ADHD, and that&#039;s why they didn&#039;t do anything. How is it you can tell if someone has read a message you sent them. I&#039;ve been reading alot about that and don&#039;t understand. I haven&#039;t had a problem with any orders with him yet.&nbsp; Did you test the phentermine? How did you find out they were fake?

				Yup, I had the same problem. I&#039;ve taken Adipex-P before, so I know that Phentermine has a very distinct bitter flavor and a speedy effect that lasts all day. The pills I received looked legit, but tasted like chalk and had no effect. I reported the listing to SR, and have sent a message to mdpro to try and resolve the issue. I was surprised to receive fake pills from a vendor who&#039;s been so highly rated, and who placed so much care into the packing and shipping of the product. Fortunately, I checked out the goods before finalizing, so my payment is still in escrow.

				I tested the &quot;Phentermine&quot; tabs I bought from mdpro using a Marquis Reagent test kit from NIK Safety. As expected, there was no color change. I sent photos of the test to an e-mail address he provided, yet he&#039;s insisting that there was an orange color change. I&#039;ve reported him as a scammer using the &quot;Report this Vendor&quot; button on his profile page and at this point I&#039;d encourage anyone else who&#039;s received bunk product from him to do the same.
