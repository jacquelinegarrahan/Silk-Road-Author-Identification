				So I have been a member here on SR for a little over half a year. During that time period I have been completing my senior year of university studies. Everything has been wonderful about my experience here and I wish to continue my path down the road, so to speak. I see how this community has changed and developed over the past several month and it has given me hope that maybe we can all retain our freedom of choice in how we live our lives. Despite all of the technical difficulty recently I am convinced that DPR and the other individuals that help keep this site up and running are saints and champions of the individual’s freedom of choice. Each and every one of us here has a valid personal reason why we are here. Regardless if it is because of need, quality of goods, or just to support the cause.<br /><br />However, one problem stands in my way…<br /><br />As I transition from being a student into a productive member of society it has come to my attention that I will have to make certain changes in order to move forward with my life, those plans include getting a really good job so I can pay off my student loans, lol. I have an excellent GPA from a business school that happens to be highly accredited institution for which only the 5% of the top international and domestic schools qualify for. <br /><br />Aside from that, I also have many years of experience in the arts. Being raised in a family run art and framing gallery has greatly influenced my path in life. I have an extremely detail oriented, creative, and analytical mind that thrives on combining beauty, form, and precise functionality. I have been looking at some tech companies recently because it has become more apparently that even thought I have concentrated and exceled in quantitative literacy across all disciplines, my ambition is to combine the arts with my degree and make new technology not only functional, but beautiful.&nbsp; Clearly banking and finance is not the path I want to take even though it has been my course of study with a major in management, not to mention that route originally planned will probably pay off my student loans faster.<br /><br />So yes, I have hit quite of a road block personally and will have to contemplate what direction to take in the future. But for now, I have one obvious problem and I would greatly appreciate the kindness and wisdom of this community to point me in the right direction.<br /><br />I love to work hard and exceed in my studies as well as professionally. I also like to party really hard when I have the time, space, and energy to do so. That being said, I will be finished with university in about 8 week and will turn the page on the next chapter of my life. Of course, this means resumes, interviews, and an ultimate a pre-employment drug test, which I am sure of. <br />Here is the issue, when I party I love cocaine. When I am on break I will keep a stash and use it daily. I also love a good Xanax to take the edge off when I am coming down. This is pretty much my only cocktail that I use now. I used to love to smoke pot until I found out that it stays in your system from quite some time so I have put that aside for now. I would like to know from all of you what to expect, how long should I put the coke and Xanax away before going in for pre-employment drug testing? Is it possible to detox your system to ensure a clean test? Please enlighten me if you can, any advice is welcome and I thank all of you in the community in advance. <br />

				Hey, first off good luck with future endeavors. You sound like you&#039;ve worked hard and will have some opportunity to pay off those loans. haha :)<br /><br /><br />With regard to your questions, of course you can detox these chems from your system. Just stop taking them a month before your interviews start. This is not a joke either. Seriously, do you want to start a career with dope in your system? With the thought of having to cheat, lie or do something&nbsp; that you sound like you will regret, in order to get the career you have worked so hard to get. No! <br /><br />Now don&#039;t take this is as some anti drug reply. That&#039;s not it. Just get the career and then fit the stuff around you being and making a successful living.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, wish you all the best.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />How can you go wrong with a name like PIXIEPIE&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp; love it...&nbsp; 8)

				Thank you so much for the reply SOUTHPAW. Box much? I have to say that it is in my humble opinion that the greatest southpaw is Antonio Tarver, did you see how quickly and precisely he took out Roy Jones Jr.? <br /><br />Being a southpaw is un-orthodox to say the least. No one can quite expect it or fully prepare for the impact from the opposite side. I saw an old trainer that I used to know through my ex (who was a southpaw himself) 10 years ago on TV last week. Xavier Biggs is apparently now working with Usher in his fitness program; it is always good to see the old timers with real knowledge and experience doing well for themselves in life. <br /><br />I find your name quite interesting, it brings back many memories. And I thank you for your advice, I do believe that will be the best course for me at this time although I have heard that benzos will stay in your system for up to 12 weeks in some cases so it looks like I will have to stop that as well very, very soon. It is all about the bob and weave at this point my friend. In any event, I thank you for your kindness and words of wisdom. I wish you all the best. <br />

				Pixie,<br /><br />Good luck with the interviewing process. It&#039;s been a long time since college for me but I know how stressful this process can be.<br />Southpaw gave you great advice. It sounds like your a recreational user, therefore, stopping for 12 weeks shouldn&#039;t be difficult and <br />should be plenty of time. I found a website that you might find interesting. http://www.passadrugtestingforall.com. <br /><br />There are many different cleanses/detoxes available here. What&#039;s nice is you can input some details about yourself and usage<br />and this will give you a list of products to use. <br /><br />These types of cleanses are also avaialble at many head and lingerie shops. Years ago I used one for a drug screening when I was <br />starting with a new company and It worked just fine. Hope this helps.

				Urine tests check for metabolic byproducts of cocaine, and in infrequent users a urine test is positive for up to two to three days after cocaine use. However, in those who use cocaine regularly, a urine test may be positive for two weeks after the last use. Hair samples can detect cocaine for several months after using. <br />You can get those kit things that supposedly clean you piss, but I&#039;ve not really got any experience with those.<br /><br />In my opinion, give it at least a few weeks before you can be sure that a blood and/or urine sample will be clean.

				From what I&#039;ve heard hair tests are pretty possible to happen in this way. So if you really are concerned you should try to be clean for 3 months at least. There are reports about special methods how to cleanse your hair but it all depends (type of hairs, times of drugs used etc.) and these methods don&#039;t work 100%. Of course you can shave all your body hair off but anyway my point is please be aware and learn about tests there are plenty of info and experiences around the web. Search for it.
