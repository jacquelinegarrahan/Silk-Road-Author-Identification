				Has anyone tried this guy&#039;s shroom caps. They&#039;re supposed to have .5+ of shroom powder in each one and they&#039;re pretty darn cheap. I fucking love shrooms (except for the taste). I would love to buy an extra large pocket full of these and take them out to my local late night hang spot and just spread the love like a baller. can you imagine a good 200 lovely people tripping on shrooms together in one of america&#039;s larger cities on a friday night? that&#039;s the american dream to me. I would be wearing the biggest grin ever all night just knowing that I&#039;d created so much joy and love.

				Since I am also a domestic shroom vendor my post will seem biased, but no one caps a full 0.5g+ per pill. I tried to go about this way of storage/sales, and 00 capsules simply CANT hold that much. If you order, you should realize you are loosing 0.05-0.1g per capsule. Times that loss by how ever many capsules you have and you will see what the REAL weight you are buying is. So lets say you buy his listing for 400g. 800*(0.075)= aprox 60g loss out of 400. So for nearly 700 dollars, you get aprox 340g of product. This type of mushroom requires 2-3 times the amount to trip as it takes with cubes. So honestly it is like you are getting between 4-6 oz of cube&#039;s for 700 dollars. Sorry to say, but that is not a good deal. Heck I sell 4oz for 400 when in stock. Remember guys not all shrooms are created equal as far as being able to trip so do your research before you start buying. Since I have no stock at the time of this writing, I receive no benefit if he makes sales or not, just wanted to point out that this is NOT a good deal on shrooms based on his own info and my experience with that type of product in the past.

				@Blueveil: Your agenda is obvious.. go generate your sales elsewhere.. and don&#039;t use&nbsp; the podium to fan your ass.&nbsp; thanks.<br /><br />Each capsule averages .6g.. .1 for the empty cap, and .5g of sclerotia powder.&nbsp; You are getting the weight you order + I throw in extra weight for shits and giggles, because I can.<br /><br />The potency is at it&#039;s maximum for my product.&nbsp; The sclerotia is aged to 9 months before harvest.. you can&#039;t get much better than that.<br /><br />I rate it at 2/3 the potency of cubensis.. but I have no doubt numbers of people can stand up and say they think that potency quote is low.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone would like to chime in.. you&#039;re welcome to do it now.<br /><br />If you have any questions on Sclerotia.. I can answer them.&nbsp; <br /><br />And as far as USASHROOMZ and Chocolates. .I believe they have stopped selling chocolate.. and are only selling dried powder now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace, Everyone..

I sell out as fast as I can list items so I don&#039;t need to steal your sales(not bragging just stating a fact). I just personally disagree with your assessment as a fellow mycologist. If you give extra caps that helps, but I doubt you[re getting .5 powder per cap. Keep it classy and passive aggressive if you like though lol. There is more than enough domestic business now that Rocker left.

				I can usually trip off of a gram of cubensis (that&#039;s like golden t&#039;s right?). So three or four caps should get me started, huh? Sounds like fun. That&#039;s the great thing about mushrooms too, even if you don&#039;t trip hard, you&#039;ll still get some little visuals and feel happy. Love it.<br /><br />Thanks for all the input guys. I think I&#039;ll order some of those caps. Out of curiousity, @Galindoi, do you have a machine to fill them or do you pay little leprocons or what? ;-) I saw a machine that&#039;s supposed to fill like 100 at a time online, it was pretty cool. I think it tamps them down too, which might explain your ability to get a full .5 in there.<br /><br />Also, @bluevail. I once tried a pressed pill that was smaller than the average pressed roll (looked like a birth control pill). I don&#039;t know how they made it and I wouldn&#039;t have tried it if I hadn&#039;t had 100% faith in the guy who gave it to me but it was mushrooms somehow. Tripped like I had just swallowed 3g (which is about a medium to heavy trip for). So I think there may be factors that you&#039;re not considering. Maybe parts of the mushroom have a higher potency to volume ratio than others.

				Well I will most likely be ordering from Galindoi next week. So for some of you guys I will post some honest reviews of his product and let you know what a few of my friends thought of well.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do love the idea of caps since I got a feeling with regular mushrooms I would be puking everywhere.

				@ funeightyone : I do use a hand machine to fill them.&nbsp; It does a fair amount at a run.&nbsp; I apply all my weight into the cap filling process.<br /><br />I have done my share of capping ground up cubensis, and I agree with blueveil that getting .5g of cubensis in a 00 capsule is near on impossible.&nbsp; The stuff is like fluffy marshmallow powder when packing.&nbsp; Real moon dust.&nbsp; The P. Galindoi Sclerotia is WAY more dense that cubensis when ground, similar to a cornmeal or sand silt, depending on where I set my grinder settings for the day.&nbsp; Either way, it packs tighter than cubensis powder.<br /><br />Swallowing the capsules is easier to get down for a lot of people.. I personally enjoy making tea with mushrooms.. way easier, hits faster, peaks higher, and the trip ends quicker.. 3 to 4 caps is going to make most people feel really stoned.. not tripping balls in any way.. but the best stoning you&#039;ve had in a while.. 10 capsules is an enjoyable trip..&nbsp; Without the Cubensis mental warping ego death episodes.&nbsp; Like having a steering wheel on your tripping experience.<br /><br />Stomach cramping from mushrooms comes 95% from the fiber of the mushroom itself reacting with your stomach walls, and intestines.&nbsp; Your body cannot break down the cell walls of the mushrooms.&nbsp; Make a tea... your trip will thank you.<br /><br />Peace,<br />Galindoi

				@Galindoi +1 good info on your stones. I agree cubes are moondust. I wasn&#039;t thinking about the density difference so yah it would be possible with that variable. I wasn&#039;t trying to diss you just protect users in a thread asking for advise which is why I started by being transparent and saying that I was a direct competitor so my advice comes with at least slight bias as no one can be completely objective with their own product. No hard feelings with you. Honestly if we sell 1mill I will still get the same pay as were not in this for the money. Profits are donated to 501c registered charities so that we know the money goes to help others. I have read up a bit more as I was misinformed of this strain and the trip sounds fascinating. I would suggest people give these a try after the new information that has come to light. From what I&#039;ve heard his customer service is good too.

				Hey Galindoi, does it make a difference of like 10 vs 12 caps to take, or is it basically wasting 2 extra caps? <br /><br />I kind of want to try out the tea method but I&#039;m wondering if it would just be horrible tasting and end up puking from it..

				I love to make tea. Use whatever flavor you like and brew it a little strong and it will mask the mushroom taste. It just has a slightly earthy taste added to the usual flavor. Grind up your wanted amount to take and brew them in a french press coffee maker for best effect.

				I&#039;ve eaten Galindoi&#039;s capsules. When he first started he sent our samples, I got 22 pills. I ate 10 of them one night and spent many hours curled up around a wood-stove pushing bits of dirt around with a piece of dog hair while thinking my life was a TV show. It was amazing. I would not recommend taking more than that though. Also, 2 of them is great for a small party, it&#039;s like being mildly stoned or somewhat drunk, just a bit of a buzz.<br /><br />I also tried USAshroomz chocolate bars, much weaker and equivalent dose (3 pieces) was barley anything in comparison, much more visual but not very mental.<br /><br />Also, galindoi had the best stealth I&#039;ve ever seen on the road, definitely one of my all time favorite vendors.<br /><br />If your trying to choose between USAshroomz and Galindoi I would say go with Galindoi, his shrooms were a lot more bang for their buck.<br /><br />And, I don&#039;t usually hype vendors this much, I tend to be pretty objective and often times hypercritical, the only other vendor that ever made me quite so happy overall was ChemicalBrothers, and that was mainly just because of the insane stealth (on MDMA).

				Well I saw Galindoi and the other seller Manna that sold Chocolates.&nbsp; I also was going to check otu another seller but don&#039;t think I could eat the mushroom without puking. I&#039;m just about 100% sure I&#039;m going to go with Galindoi do 10 capsules and see how that goes. :)

				I&#039;ve made tea with golden t&#039;s many times. If you put some frozen (or fresh- even better) strawberries in there (sounds weird, but it works) along with peperment herbal tea (or better yet some mint leaves), it actually tastes quite enjoyable. And I&#039;ve shared a quarter oz between three people and still all had a really nice trip. I think somehow the tea is more potent. Anyway, some of my best experience have been with tea. <br /><br />But then, I have yet to have a bad experience with mushrooms. It&#039;s SUCH a happy, love the world and everyone in it kind of high for me.<br /><br />
