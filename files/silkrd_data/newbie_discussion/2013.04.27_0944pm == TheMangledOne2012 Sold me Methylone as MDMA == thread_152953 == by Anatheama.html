				So, had a previous large order with the above seller, on a more recent one I (stupidly, and against my better judgement) FE&#039;d, and at first I thought everything was good. Shipping was fast, the product appeared clean, and based upon the quality I&#039;d been sent the time before (which was very good!) I was very happy.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t until I started giving some out and had a very angry customer come back with a pretty obvious not-MDMA reagent test result that I realised my mistake in not testing the stuff, so here it is from my own test kits:<br /><br />http://i43.tinypic.com/k7tx3.jpg (warning clearnet).<br /><br />Pretty clearly NOT MDMA.<br /><br />I&#039;ve put this forum thread up here so that other potential buyers can be warned, and so that the vendor can have a chance to make amends for what they&#039;ve done.<br />Unfortunately I was foolish and FE&#039;d, so there&#039;s very little that I can do asides make things very public like this.<br />I&#039;ve tested this methylone with EZTest kits bought over the past month, as well as with some bottled marquis reagent, and it&#039;s a pure-yellow methylone reaction every time.<br /><br />Edit - Link to the vendor page in question:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a9d0046760

Honestly, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any excuse for selling Methylone as MDMA. If you&#039;re a vendor on SR, you shouldn&#039;t be that incompetent. Impurities in drugs can kill people for fuck&#039;s sake.

				Hello all, <br /><br />Sorry about this unfortunate mishap, as I have explained to Anatheama there was a big problem when me and my supplier picked up off our source, and recieved what was told to be MDMA but very clean. It did look a little questionable to me as I have seen MDMA look like that see through and bright, but the crystals just had something different about them. <br />Anyway we got it back and tested it on Robadope and Simons test as that is all I have left currently and it went blue instantly which led me to believe that it was indeed MDMA.<br /><br />But now Anatheama has pointed out, that the Robadope/Simons also goes blue for Methylone, and he had tested it with his kit containing the Mandelin &amp; Marquis and it went Yellow for Methylone, as soon as he informed me of this me and my supplier have spoke straight to our source as he has fucked us over, leaving us with a lot of the stuff telling us it was MDMA, when clearly ,we now know it is not.<br /><br />After alot of hassle with the source we will be getting a refund for all the rest of the product we have and are in the middle of establishing a different new source for the Golden/Brown sugar MDMA sweet safrole crystal, its a little bit more costly but shouldnt be much different on SR, going to be worth it though ,as we wont be doing business with the other source anymore, I am investing in another full EZ test kit again as my Mandelin has ran out and the Marquis has seemed to of gone off to a nasty brown liquid inside.<br /><br />We will be giving you a full refund Anatheama, I can personally get an ounce of the MDMA what is coming back in to send out to you today, it will cost me more at the moment because it will just be me buying that straight for you at smalls prices like £450, then when the big lot comes in this week I will get reimbursed.<br /><br />I hope this has not put anyone off ordering from us, We are here to please, and this is the first experience for us to go wrong which agreed, was our fault for not FULLY testing the product with every reagent test.<br /><br />That is not the reason we ask to finalize early either, its mentioned on our page why we ask for FE but my supplier is getting abit more trustworthy of our regulars and such and will start to ease up on it soon, its just as we were starting off he did not put much trust into things.<br /><br />I hope this clears up the issue, the next MDMA in will be real 100% guaranteed if not then we will not have anything until we do get MDMA :)<br /><br />Cheers<br />Mangled

I&#039;d be kicking myself until my legs were bloody stumps if I&#039;d bought as much methylone as you guys have. It&#039;s something that cost me once before in my early days, wound up with 50g of the stuff and that was painful enough at the time.<br /><br />Second, you should probably contact SR support about the ratings thing - if the user has reported you (and it looks like they did when this whole thing started) then vendor support might have put a penalty on your rating, and in that case they&#039;ll probably remove it once it&#039;s resolved.<br /><br />Alternatively if you have outstanding orders which you marked as having not arrived then in the absence of user reviews that might impact your rating, I&#039;m not sure.

				Why bother with reagent tests? www.ecstasydata.org will test tablets with mass spectrometry for $40 (USD) and all other samples (e.g. powder or crystals) for $140. It&#039;s not dirt cheap, but it would be very affordable for a vendor who has a bulk supplier.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it a small price to pay for the safety of your customers?

				Vendor has offered refund/reship so I&#039;m just waiting now to see how it goes. Have been told it could be a few days so I&#039;ll keep this thread updated and revise my feedback as appropriate.

				I&#039;ve been trying to get a refund/reship out of the vendor since they posted here over a week ago, I notice their MDMA listings are back up again so I&#039;ve readjusted my feedback appropriately. Hopefully this does all get sorted out but just wanted to leave another update&nbsp; ::)

				Had a big issue with a large batch of Methylone which we got sold as MDMA, I only had Robadope and Simons testers at the time and it showed up blue leading me and my supplier to believe it was the real deal, but a regular customer tested it with the full reagent kit and it showed yellow for Methylone, I didn&#039;t realise that Methylone went blue on the Robadope/Simons too. Basically we got stitched for a massive massive amount of it and we are now having to resolve alot of issues with a bulk order and many other people this had been shipped out and sold to.<br />We have now scrapped that source and will be going back to an older source, more reliable with the same lovely sweet old school synthed MDMA, like clear/golden sugar.<br />It could be around a week until we can reload, at the moment we only have about 5grams or so in stock.<br />For anyone that had an issue with this we are terribly sorry, my supplier has lost out alot from it.<br />Also that was not the reason we finalized early on big amounts, my supplier would like to cash out the coins asap due to the volatile market a couple of weeks back, we should not be so bad with this now and FE will not be as necesserary depending on Purchasing stats etc<br />This has been a real bad turn of events for us, our first problem since we started back up the shop and have been trying to get our Feedback / Ratings back up how they used to be a year ago.<br /><br />You can trust in me that I will go to the best of my ability, along with my supplier to handle any problems that might pop up along the way like this one.<br /><br />But, please see faith, I am not a scammer, I despise them, I always strive to supply only great quality chemicals at very competitive prices, I have also been a huge long term customer on the road with a different username for nearly 2 years and I did get scammed myself a few times to begin with, so I know what its like,&nbsp; not nice. <br /><br />My purchase stats are <br />Total transactions: 146<br />Total spent: ฿1880.64<br />Refund rate: 4.14%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 year<br /><br />Thankyou for hearing me out,<br />MangledOne<br />
