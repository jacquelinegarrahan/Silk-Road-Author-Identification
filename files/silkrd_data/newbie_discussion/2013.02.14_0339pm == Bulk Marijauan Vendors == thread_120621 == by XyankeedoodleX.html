				So I&#039;m sure there are a bunch of people like me out there. When I first found out about SR I was all happy &quot;Yeah I&#039;m gonna have the best bud at the lowest prices!!! I&#039;m gonna make so much money!!!&quot;, well that dream involves a lot of work and research. I spent nearly a month shopping around different vendors, messaging them asking what type of pries they could do on a QP - 4 pounds (I never go to 5 because I don&#039;t want a federal charge). So anyways back on topic. I am making this thread so newbies can easily figure out who they should begin talking to for bulk marijuana sales! <br /><br />I have used a couple of different vendors on here for bud, first person was tastEtrEats. His prices were good and so was his service...in the beginning....then it all went to shit and I stopped using him. Now I am using cocezero and I think I have found my go to vendor for bulk buddddd. <br /><br />I started talking to him in December when I first ordered a QP from him for $740. The quality of the bud that I got is what I was expecting for what I had paid. Shipping took about 3 days to the East Coast with double vac seal. I flipped it, made over $600 and ordered a pound for $2000 FE! The quality on this was the same as before, fluffy leafy outdoor buds that STINK. Again about 3 days to the East Coast, same good packaging. Made mad bread on that pound after this he went on a little hiatus for about a week. After he came back I ordered 2 more!!! <br /><br />Now these 2 most recent pounds I have gotten from cocezero....WOW&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D AM I A HAPPY CAMPER!!! The quality on this bud is PHENOMENAL. It is sooooo dense a QP looks like 2 ounces. The smell is OUT OF THIS WORLD. This looks like indoor bud I got at an outdoor price. The shipping was overnight, shipped Wednesday received Thursday. The packaging was TOP NOTCH this time. I wont go into too much detail but he used mylar and double vac seal. I don&#039;t know what all he did on his break but he sure stepped his game up! <br /><br />If anybody has any more reviews on cocezero or any other bulk marijuana vendor feel free to contribute!!! Please do if you have dealt with any bulk marijuana vendor, remember how it was when you first started? Sifting through all the bullshit. Don&#039;t you wish you had a nice helpful thread like this to read?&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES/REVIEWS SHOULD NOT BE YOUR ONLY RESEARCH WHEN FINDING A BULK VENDOR! THIS IS MEANT TO LEAD YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO SAFE/TRUSTED VENDORS AND AWAY FROM SCAMERS. PLEASE LOOK UP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN HERE ON THE FORUMS AND ON THEIR VENDOR PROFILE BEFORE ORDERING. ONLY FE IF YOU REALLY TRUST THE VENDOR. NOBODY HERE WILL FEEL SORRY FOR YOU IF YOU LOSE YOUR MONEY BECAUSE YOU FINALIZED EARLY.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120621.msg832126#msg832126">Quote from: Festivalia on February 16, 2013, 11:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> ;D Was looking for this thread! Thank you for making it... I just ordered a LB from CoceZero, and I have not gotten much info on his bud from anyone. I&#039;ve seen some people saying negative things, but reading this is somewhat reassuring to the quality. So, what was your honest opinion of your first bulk order from him? Some say he &#039;sprays&#039; his bud w/ TastyPuff... I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s not the case, since you just posted this a couple days ago, and those posts I read about that were a month or two old.<br /><br />To stay on topic, I will add reviews based on experience for several Marijuana vendors from best to just okay. Most of these guys(and gals) do bulk. Some do not, but fuck it. Butt-fuck it.<br /><br /><br /><br />First place vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Alien-Grade&quot; Cannabis: &quot;BajoZero&quot; - Price Range ($300/ounce, $55/8th, $50-$60 grams of concentrate)<br /><br />My experiences with BajoZero from first transaction to weekly purchase, have all been flawless. This guy goes through each order and handles them with extreme care. He will make sure that he makes the package &quot;crush-proof&quot; before vac-sealing. And he separates individual strains, and even professionally labels everything. He reminds me a lot of myself. Very organized. The quality of cannabis he offers is simply unmatched on this site. That&#039;s not to belittle other vendors, as Bajo currently does NOT offer bulk. He offers everything else though! From personal 1g, or even 1/2g listings of oil, wax, bho, and shatter... to eighths, quarters, and ounces of MMJ. He typically picks up strains that are familiar, but at times he&#039;s got some oddities. And none of it comes from Cali! It&#039;s all Pacific NW - &quot;Washington&#039;s Best&quot;.<br />Stealthier than anything from Cali, just off the bat. And then it&#039;s all super professional, printed labels, etc. Above and beyond expectations.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Second Place(a) vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Professional-Grade&quot; Cannabis: &quot;Christy Nugs&quot; - Price Range ($275/ounce, $1000/qp, $350/ounce of hash)<br /><br />From the beginning I noticed Christy had the reputation of being one of the best. I reluctantly stayed away because she made herself sound so... picky... and I thought her prices were &quot;high&quot; ... and then months later I bought her weed. Holy shit. This chick knows how to grow some dank fucking bud! That &quot;Fire OG&quot; is some of my favorite chronic I&#039;ve ever smoked, and I will always pick up more when she has it available. She&#039;s the best stealth just because she goes above and beyond to make sure her packs are smell proof, xray proof, and sometimes even open-proof if you don&#039;t have the right means! 2-3 days Coast to Coast, and I would HIGHLY recommend her qps. They fly out the door...&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Second Place(b) vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Alien-Grade/Pro-Grade&quot; Cannabis: MRGreenThumb - Price Range ($900-$1000/qp)<br /><br />This vendor popped up out of the blue, with a pleasant, business-minded attitude and their listings sat untouched for 2 weeks... I sent them a message, chatted a bit, and ordered a bunch of strains they had available. 2-3 days later, my jaw was successfully on the floor. This is the same quality I previously described as &quot;Alien-Grade&quot; in my Bajo review. FRESH, STICKY, GORGEOUS, COLORFUL indoor bud. The only reason &quot;he&quot; doesn&#039;t get first place, is, because &quot;he&quot; isn&#039;t around much with listings. This is another vendor(mentioned in this post)&#039;s alternate account for selling their friend&#039;s grows... nothing wrong with that! Purple Dragon(omg) Blue Dragon(fuck yes!)... Hindu Kush(omfg)... Alpha Kush(OMFG). Fantastic products, when they&#039;re around.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Third Place vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Top-Shelf Medical-Grade&quot; Cannabis: NorCal420HookUp - Price Range ($300/ounce, $900-$1000/qp, $3300-$3600/lb)<br /><br />This was my first (weed)vendor I&#039;d ever used for bulk. NorCal offers some of the finest Kush strains available, for those who want something different than all the listings for OG. His Master Kush is simply the best, most potent indica-heavy strain I&#039;ve had. It hits me like a sack of bricks, puts me on my ass. And it&#039;s powerful earthy-skunk taste just lingers... and lingers. He&#039;s always been willing to go out of his way to customize, or even worth with me on price. Once he even fronted me a portion of the cost of an order, because I had money locked up elsewhere. A real stand-up guy, providing some of the best quality cannabis on the road. Watch out for his Bubba Kush and Cheese! Both wonderfully grown, and cured treats! His blue dream is nothing to shake a stick at either... but it&#039;s not as available as other strains. Very on-par and similar to the Blue Dream provided by Christy Nug! Stealth is simply the best. Not as &quot;fancy&quot; as the above vendors... and there will be &#039;some&#039; compression... but the nugs are healthy when they arrive! This guys been doing this a lot longer than some of the younger bucks. Definitely a go-to for bulk.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Fourth Place vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Top-Shelf Medical-Grade&quot; Cannabis: &quot;SolidRain&quot; - Price Range ($275/ounce, $650-850/qp, also sells oils.)<br /><br />This guy always has STEALS on qps of the BEST quality cannabis. Get em while their hot, cause they NEVER last!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Fifth Place vendor based on Quality ~ AAA+ &quot;Top-Shelf Medical-Grade&quot; Cannabis: &quot;MrHumboldt&quot; - Price Range ($300/ounce, $750-900/qp, 3200-3500/lb)<br /><br />Not much to say other than he&#039;s quiet, quick, efficient, and loves his CAPSLOCK. haha - Great quality weed. Carries similar strains as NorCal420HookUp. Makes sense since their packs come out of the same post office. Shit, they&#039;re probably friends irl. Who knows! Recommended for quality.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />6th - KaliforniaProducts $3500/lb (Indoor) - Very fast, very stealth, and people seem to forget about him a lot. So he doesn&#039;t run out often.<br /><br />7th - HeartofHumboldt $3200/lb (Outdoor/Indo) - Very fast, stealth. Indoor is decent, not the best, but better than average. The outdoor is some of the best outdoor I&#039;ve had. Good strain selection.<br /><br />8th - HappySmoke420 $900/qps (Indoor) - Fast, Washington State, bud is great quality... but I find it to be somewhat trimmy at times. Think he thinks the leaves make the buds prettier. :P<br /><br />9th - HumboldtsFinest $750-950/qps (Greenhouse/Indoor) - Fast. Reliable. Consistently stocked. Good stuff for the price.<br /><br />10th - Sour Diesel Man $2600-3100/lbs (Greenhouse/Indoor) - Fast as hell. Sometimes inconsistent. Mostly good.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well you seem to have ordered from everybody I have become a fan of and want to order from to see how their bud is! I can&#039;t wait for you to get cocezeros bud so I can FINALLY see somebody who can actually compare it to other vendors on here. I personally think maybe the first couple of packages I got from him MIGHT have been sprayed. Only reason I even say that is because once people start accusing you automatically think &quot;oh this bud smells way to nice for what it looks like&quot;. I&#039;ve seen plenty of bud that doesn&#039;t look like it should from the smell. However, with that being said, I did notice the smoke with the first couple of pick ups from him (outdoor fluffy, leafy, poor trim job) definetly had a VERY VERY VERY harsh smoke. That could have been from the poor trim job though. I&#039;ve never come across bud that I knew was sprayed so I don&#039;t really have anything to compare it to. <br /><br />The most recent order I have from cocezero...OH MY SWEET BABY JESUS. He gets me a REALLY good price, best one I ever see on his listings, so when I opened my package my jaw DROPPED. It isn&#039;t alien nug but it&#039;s on the end of indoor/medical/pro. The only thing missing is a super dank smell when it is in small amounts (quarters and eights) it&#039;s got the sticky and its got that icky ;) <br /><br />I do plan on ordering a supplemental QP or two from some of the top vendors on your list for my high priced customers to make them happy for paying $4,000 a pound :D

				mrouid should be on that list too, <br />His bud might not be the best, but his stealth is amazing. <br />And he delivers bulk to Europe (that&#039;s a huge plus for us people who live across the pond)
