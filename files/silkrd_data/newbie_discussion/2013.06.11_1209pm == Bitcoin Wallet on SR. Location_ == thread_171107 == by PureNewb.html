				Hello.<br />Im newb so ofc its a newb question.<br /><br />Does anyone know if the bitcoin wallet on SR is located in or outside the EU.<br />I ask for this information because, the service which converts my normal money into bitcoins is taking a 2.1% if the wallet is located inside the EU. <br /><br />Hope my questions is understandable. <br /><br />-PureNewb.

				What exchange are you using? that doesn&#039;t sound right. <br />No one knows where the servers are so i don&#039;t think anyone can help you with that.

				The site seems legit up to you whether you use it or not. All i can advise to avoid that fee, is download a Bitcoin qt wallet to your PC and then you will be transferring to a wallet inside your domestic country.<br /><br />http://bitcoin.org/en/download<br /><br />BTW when you have transferred coin to your wallet make sure to back it up and encrypt.

				Ye the site is legit. I used it on my first bitcoin purchase. Bought the bitcoin straight to my bitcoin wallet on SR. On my first purchase i accepted the fee since i didnt knew where the wallet was located. <br />I&#039;m just wondering if i can get avoid the fee on my next bitcoin purchase. <br /><br />I already have a bitcoin wallet on my computer and since i live in the EU. Does that mean the wallet is located inside the EU?

				i&#039;m fairly confident this is not based on the location of the btc wallet. it may be based on the location of your bank acct. It is a better idea to put the btc through a mixer like bitfog or bitlaundry, before transferring to SR. <br /><br />SR has a mixer between you and the dealer, but if you transfer money with your bank info, exchange into BTC and send directly to SR, any cops that look at you are going to know where your money went.

The wallet is stored on your PC so the wallet is where-ever you are. From there you could transfer to SR.

				Pure red eye:<br />I&#039;m not sure i get you or vice versa.<br />The fee comes if they are sending the bitcoins (you have paid for in &quot;real&quot; money) to a wallet located inside the EU.<br />Therefor i ask if my bitcoin wallet on SR is located in or outside the EU. But it looks like it isnt possibly to get this informaiton, and another user tells that its risky to get money straight from the exchange to my wallet on SR.<br /><br />Since i am located inside the EU and i want to avoid the fee, i need a wallet outside EU. I have just created an account on Bitcoin fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion). It would be a pleasure if anyone could tell me if the wallet on bitcoin fog is located inside the EU or outside. <br />

				Yeah its correct that the situation is i need to get a bitcoin wallet outside EU, where i can get my exchanged bitcoins at, so i can get around the fee.<br /><br />Since no one knows where the SR servers are located. Would there be a great chance, that my wallet on SR is located outside EU?
