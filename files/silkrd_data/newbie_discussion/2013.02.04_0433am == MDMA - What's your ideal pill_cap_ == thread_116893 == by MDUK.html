				So, I&#039;m registered on here investigating the possibility of bringing some high-quality MDMA capsules/pills to market some time soon, and since I can&#039;t post in the actual forum for market research until I&#039;ve made my required 50 posts.<br />Oh well, if that&#039;s the cost of doing business then so be it.<br /><br />Basically, the capsules I manufacture locally are ~150mg each, but I notice most of the other sellers on here selling caps put them at more like 100mg, so for those of you who are in the market for this sort of thing what would be your preferred dosage, given that I can do anything up to 300mg/cap fairly easily? Do you like the low-dose pills/caps so you can double-drop if necessary, or the high-dose pills/caps that hit you like a freight train?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any trouble shifting the 150mg caps around here, but I imagine things are a bit different in an environment in which I&#039;m far from the only person with decent molly. The ones I do here are MDMA + Microcrystalline cellulose (inert) or MDMA + Microcrystalline Cellulose + Caffeine.<br /><br />(to the mods: If this isn&#039;t acceptable for this section feel free to close and I won&#039;t try to open one of these until I have access to the right forum - obviously I have no intention of trying to sell over the forums, I&#039;d much rather wait until I have the demand here sussed and can open a seller account to do this properly.)

				Most people in my area find 120mg to be a good size, and if they need to simply redose either half a pill or a whole pill later in the night. I&#039;d assume that in areas where MDMA is more available people would have a higher tolerance and as such need more, but I&#039;m not sure.
