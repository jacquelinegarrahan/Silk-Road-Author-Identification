				I placed an order two weeks ago, and then the site started getting attacked.&nbsp; The seller said that they were shipping it out last Wednesday or Thursday.&nbsp; It&#039;s just shipping within the US so I feel like it should be here by tomorrow or saturday at the latest.&nbsp; &nbsp;How long do you guys wait before you start asking the vendor about it?

				depends how it was shipped... from within the US at least, it shouldn&#039;t be more than 2 business days for express, 3 business days for priority, or 7 business days for standard mail, (mon-fri) but the usps does fuck up now and again. if its been longer than the appropriate time for your shipping method, from the day that your order was actually marked &#039;in transit,&#039; nothing wrong with letting the seller know you still haven&#039;t received it. i usually pay for priority so i dont have to wait around wondering for very long. i&#039;d give it another few days beyond the average shipping time before starting to worry or anything.

				Okay, yea im pretty sure it was sent the slowest possible through usps.&nbsp; I will be doing priority from now on.&nbsp; It sucks waiting around.

				2 weeks is TOO long for something within the US .......contact your vendor and get him to confirm shipment. If no answer it&#039;s likely you are waiting on something that isn&#039;t coming. Don&#039;t panic it&#039;s possible there has been some kind of mix up .... I would definitely send him a message .

				Sorry I did not see ( saw it did not read it) where you had communication with the vendor and last Wed or Thurs was part of the trouble time frame for SRr&#039;s DOS attack. Be patient but I would think even a week is a bit long and I don&#039;t know of too many vendors doing snail mail.
