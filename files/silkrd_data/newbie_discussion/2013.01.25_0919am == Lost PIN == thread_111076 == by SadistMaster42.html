				Hi, I am not aware of anywhere you can just look at it like in account details or something.. Don&#039;t think you can. When you created your account you should have had to make a pin. Try anything you can think of. Just don&#039;t go over 5 attempts. If worse comes to worse you can just create a new account and go ahead and send you bitcoins to your new account. Remember the pin this time.

				Please see the wiki on forgetting your PIN:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=PIN<br /><br />Basically, put the wrong PIN in 5 times and it will then make you wait a period of time, after which you can reset your PIN.

What was the last SR wallet address used to deposit BTC into the account?<br /><br />~SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read....I have never told nyone anyone of my oersonl info up here so itd hard to beieve that some random SR staff would be trying to steal from me. She sent this letter to the new account&nbsp; I was told to made where i wrote SR staff from. <br /><br />Pleaase scout, what do I do now? I am somehwta lost and confused at this point. My account was fucked up days ago when i enetered the wrong info over 5 times or whatever. Is there anything that can be done at this point? What would you do scout?

				It depends on the problem.&nbsp; SR Support seems to think you were locked out of your account entirely because you forgot your password, but here, you say you lost your PIN.&nbsp; So which one is it?&nbsp; If you&#039;re entirely locked out of your account, then, yes, you needed to create that new account and will need to provide SR Support with info to verify that the account belongs to you.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you lost your PIN (which is what you stated here) then you should still have access to your account and should still be able to reset the PIN on your own.<br /><br />
