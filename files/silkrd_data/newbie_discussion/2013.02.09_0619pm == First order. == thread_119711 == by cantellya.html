				Will vendors decline an order if you&#039;re a newbie? I do a lot more reading on these forums than posting- so I just wonder how that reflects, if at all on the actual SR.

				No, most vendors will work with newbies :)<br /><br />Some require things like finalizing early (which I wouldn&#039;t do except under exceptional circumstances), or won&#039;t give you a full refund if you&#039;re new, but - depending on what you&#039;re buying - it&#039;s usually possible to find a vendor who&#039;ll treat newbies well. AFAIK, post count has no effect on whether vendors will deal with you or not - only your purchase/refund history.

				It depends on the seller, but most are very understandable. There&#039;s always the escrow system which helps alleviate some of the concern of sellers selling to newbies. If you&#039;re still unsure with a particular seller, then just message them. Almost everyone is very nice.

				If a vendor refuses to do business just because you&#039;re new, he is an asshole, and you should decide NOT to do business with him.&nbsp; It&#039;s a different story when the potential buyer has a long list of forced finalizations or returns, but if it&#039;s just because you&#039;re new, that&#039;s just a dick way to be.&nbsp; There&#039;s one vendor on here who says that if you have less than 5 transactions you must email him first for permission to place an order, and guess how many transactions he&#039;s made?&nbsp; ZERO.

				Check their vendor page to see if they are open to it or not.&nbsp; When in doubt, shoot them a message to confirm - use PGP even though youre prbly not gonna be sending sensitive info in this message just to show youre with it.&nbsp; Stay in escrow, dont FE, should be good (at least I hope as I am waiting on my first in transit)

				On the mdma i would recommend staying domestic unless your trying for bulk or something.&nbsp; <br />My 10g order w SuperTrips is on it&#039;s 12th shipping day and still nothing.&nbsp; I however made the mistake of FE, since he request it for orders under 1000usd.&nbsp; It hasnt been too long i suppose, by the 22nd day if still nothing i&#039;ll message his team.&nbsp; Great first order experience for me..

				Oh, man, that sucks.&nbsp; You might want to go ahead and email his &quot;team&quot; now.&nbsp; SR&#039;s escrow system is the single most powerful tool the buyers have against fraud.&nbsp; When you give that away, there&#039;s no going back.

				My first order I ordered a gram of weed domestically and apparently the weed was seized pfft, didint even get a customs letter. The guy must of been testing to see how fucking retarded I was, but I kept bugging him 24/7 and he evantluy did a 100% resend and it arrived 2 days later, just be careful alot of vendors a dicks and take of advantage of you because your new, but whist saying that there&#039;s some awesome vendors out there that will do the right thing by you.
