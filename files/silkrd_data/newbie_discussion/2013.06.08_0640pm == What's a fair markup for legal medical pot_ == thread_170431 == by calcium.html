				Reference: https://legalmarijuanadispensary.com/ - lists prices for a whole lot of medical marijuana dispensaries.<br /><br />What do y&#039;all think is a fair markup over that? The dispensaries sell legally (at least by state law); SR vendors take on serious legal risk by packaging it for sale and shipping it out of state. And of course, they serve customers who aren&#039;t in legal states. <br /><br />How much is that worth?<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that some listings seem to be significantly above the CA market prices, some (e.g. Canadian) are actually lower, and some (apparently from CA vendors) are almost exactly the dispensary rate (to the extent that I&#039;m not sure how they manage to make enough margin, after shipping etc).

				Most of the people selling cannabis on here are getting it much cheaper than the dispensary prices.&nbsp; They would be very dumb to be getting it from a dispensary for that reason.&nbsp; $1,000 a pound for very good strain name outdoor is a pretty standard price in NorCal.&nbsp; Indoor varies in prices depending on your connections.<br /><br />Think of it this way.&nbsp; Quad dose indica, sativa and hybrid Cheeba Chews cost $8 or less in a dispensary.&nbsp; Those ARE bought at a dispensary.&nbsp; Now go look at the prices that people are charging on here.

				Keep in mind also, that in addition to the risk of prison time, for me, sourcing and packaging orders takes a lot of time.&nbsp; I hear rumors about vendors getting rich from SR, but I&#039;m definitely not in that situation.&nbsp; If you break down my hourly wage, it&#039;s not very good, and that&#039;s for a job that could lead to federal prison.&nbsp; So what do you think is a fair markup?&nbsp; For instance, as a percentage?
