				localbitcoins is the easiest most straight forward site. Seriously, just forget all the other bs methods and use them, i did the same signing up to fucking shitload of different sites trying to figure out the easiest method, turns out it&#039;s local bitcoins. sign up click a vendor, send the money to his account a viola within minutes the btcs will appear in your wallet.

				If you&#039;re in the US, the best is blue sky traders : http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm&nbsp; It&#039;s the easiest and also cheapest way to get them.<br /><br />If you&#039;re somewhere else then it&#039;s&nbsp; localbitcoins.com&nbsp; but you should only access that using TOR and sign up with an email you made on TOR if you want to be anonymous, also don&#039;t give any real info just make up a fake name.<br /><br />You can also buy them if you have an anonymous prepaid credit card, an anonymous PayPal account and other things like that. Localbitcoins is usually pretty expensive compared to other services but it&#039;s always better than using a vendor on SR where you have to pay western union fees on top of huge fees from the vendor.

				You will receive text updates to your phone confirming the various stages of the transaction i.e your moneys been sent, the btcs have been sent etc. I just input my real number. Unless your trying to be anonymous, in which case local btc may not be the best option, i would just enter your correct number, buying btcs isn&#039;t illegal.

				If you don&#039;t care about being anonymous just buy bitcoins with a wire transfer. You don&#039;t even need to use the LBTC escrow system, using your phone number is optional anyways. And buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal but that doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t get them anonymously, buying precursors and glassware isn&#039;t illegal either, but not buying them anonymously isn&#039;t such a good idea if you don&#039;t have plausible deniability as to why you have it. Furthermore, if you do everything through TOR, putting your real phone number makes you linked to everything you&#039;ve done on TOR while logged in to LBTC.

				just have a couple of wallets and tumble it that way if you are paranoid about traceability and need to use a wire transfer with your real name.<br /><br />SR tumble it anyway once you send it through to your account and you can always follow the blockchain if concerned.<br /><br />Re getting BTC, try setting up an account with Mt Gox, but you&#039;ll need ID etc.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can get them through Virwox easily enough but they gouge you a bit with fees but its instantaneous and if you do it a couple of times then they stop implementing the manual step and send your BTC to wherever straightaway.

				Why the hell would you use MtGox when bitstamp.net is as reliable and doesn&#039;t require verification? MtGox is a big no-no for silkroad. You can also access bitstamp through TOR, they don&#039;t flag your account for that. Fuck MtGox.<br /><br />With localbitcoins, buy in person with cash. If you use your bank account of a traceable payment method then you shouldn&#039;t use TOR to access the site.

It&#039;s all explained on localbitcoins.com.. Don&#039;t use a bank transfer or PayPal or things like that.

				No problem Tree, i just can&#039;t be bothered with being too secretive etc. I&#039;m not a vendor so am not overly worried.&nbsp; I generally buy my BTC using a CC and transfer that way.

I don&#039;t know if bitinnovate is okay..
