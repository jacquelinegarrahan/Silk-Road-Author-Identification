				Hi all,<br /><br />It appears that my account has been compromised.<br /><br />On the original thread, Libertas strongly suggested that I:<br /><br />&quot;Backup all your important data to an external hard drive, scan it with as many different anti-virus / anti-malware / anti-spyware / anti-rootkit programs as possible (preferably portable versions), then re-install your OS and create a new account...&quot;<br /><br />Before I do all of the above, would it be equally effective to simply roll-back my computer via Time Machine to a date prior to ever having visited SR?<br /><br />If not, does anyone have any suggestions about effective anti-malware/spyware/rootkit software for Mac?<br /><br />I&#039;m currently scanning it with freeware called Avast, which was highly rated. Would that find the problems mentioned above? Running most current versions of OSX and Tor.<br /><br />thanks!

				How is it that you think you were compromised? I have been on Apple computers since 1995ish and I have NEVER had a virus/trojan/malware. I do not run anti-virus software and NEVER will, but I do scan it occasionally with macscan just to be certain. I do use icefloor firewall software and subscribe to a blacklist site for known bad addresses, etc. Give me some details on how and why you think you were compromised and then go from there...<br />I will subscribe to this thread so we can stay in touch...<br />Good luck

I also use Little Snitch. It&#039;s most likely that that I got phished. Also, my PIN was VERY weak.<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;ve written it off to experience. I only lost about $100, and only had a few purchases on my record. I&#039;ve set up a new account, with much stronger passwords.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to reply.

				Oh man, terrible... Sorry to hear this.<br /><br />Do you run parallels on your Mac?<br />I use Macs and only Macs but I&#039;ve never had issues. <br />My rule of thumb: If I don&#039;t absolutely need it, I don&#039;t download it.<br />If I were you, I would either:<br />1) Check my password/username/PIN a gadgillion times. I know this is dumb advice but be sure to pay attention to CAPS too.<br />2) Assume I got phished, because I have a hard time believing that someone installed malware&nbsp; on your mac to get on your SR account. It&#039;s possible, sure- but I think targeting PC users would be a lot less work for anyone that wanted 100 dollars. In this case, time machine doesn&#039;t matter.<br />3) Run time machine or just back up the files you want on an external drive and reinstall OSX.<br /><br />Hopefully everything works out for you man.. Hang in there &amp; good luck with your new acct. <br />

You don&#039;t need your PIN to login to SR<br />2. You (and everyone else) really should be using a password keeper. 1Password is great on the Mac. Lastpass is supposedly good, too.<br />3. Your Mac is probably fine.

				You don&#039;t need a PIN to log into SR but an SR account is useless to anyone who doesn&#039;t have a PIN. If his account got jacked, the money can&#039;t be touched nor can purchases be made without the intruder having the PIN. Correct me if I&#039;m mistaken.

The most likely explanation is the user didn&#039;t write down the user/password when the account was created. Or just simply forgot/doesn&#039;t understand simple instructions to retrieve a password and pin. <br /><br />If you can get logged in to the account, entering the wrong pin trying to make purchases or change the wallet info will lock the account for 72 hours (as a safety precaution) after attempting/entering an incorrect pin combination 10 times. <br /><br />Once you wait the 72 hours SR will give you a link to click on at the top of the page once the 72 hours has passed and after the next login. <br /><br />When you see the first welcome page you can reset/reselect a new pin (whatever length you want, the longer the better the strength) without having the previous unknown pin. Pretty simple and worth trying to retrieve that $100 in the account.<br /><br />Good luck<br />

				You could roll back to whatever date you want to, but I would just suggest to rebuild the machine from scratch with fresh installs of everything. You should be able to keep files such as mp3&#039;s, documents, and iphoto stuff, but as he had said put them on a remote time capsule drive and scan them before dragging them back with a virus program. <br />You probably did just get your stuff phished, but once you have been exposed it can screw you over all over the place. If you do like most people and have a gazzilion things using the same passwords your life could be very miserable. <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t do business with Communist Countries. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160441.msg1133717#msg1133717">Quote from: alexcutter on May 16, 2013, 12:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi all,<br /><br />It appears that my account has been compromised.<br /><br />On the original thread, Libertas strongly suggested that I:<br /><br />&quot;Backup all your important data to an external hard drive, scan it with as many different anti-virus / anti-malware / anti-spyware / anti-rootkit programs as possible (preferably portable versions), then re-install your OS and create a new account...&quot;<br /><br />Before I do all of the above, would it be equally effective to simply roll-back my computer via Time Machine to a date prior to ever having visited SR?<br /><br />If not, does anyone have any suggestions about effective anti-malware/spyware/rootkit software for Mac?<br /><br />I&#039;m currently scanning it with freeware called Avast, which was highly rated.
