				I recently made my SR account and have yet to use it.&nbsp; Ideally, I&#039;d like a nice indica strain to appear in my mailbox, but before I order something that bold, I&#039;d like to try the system with something that the local cops might not throw the book at me for if something goes wrong.&nbsp; The two things that have crossed my mind are coca leaves (or tea), which I&#039;ve always wanted to try, and khat.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any luck finding them using the search feature, and the general slowness of the site makes the categories on the left less than ideal.&nbsp; Not to mention that I don&#039;t even know what category khat would fall under.<br /><br />Does anyone know if these item are even available through SR, and if so, where I can find them?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				If you have never purchased anything before and are a bit wary of SR, trust me I was the same way, then just buy something very small that is either legal, or barely illegal like schedule 4 or something.<br /><br />I know what khat is, but never seen it on SR before.<br /><br />There&#039;s probably alot of legal nootropics available, a sample of that would be lost cost. Modafinil is schedule IV, so even if cops caught you with that, I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;d really give too much of a shit. Zolpidem is schedule IV also.<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of legal shit you can buy on SR, i know there&#039;s a porno section, ebooks and shit too.<br /><br />Honestly tho, if you ordered weed as your first purchase, and it was a relatively small amount you&#039;d be fine. The first thing I ever ordered was a 1/4 oz of weed from a reputable vendor, showed up in my 3 days later. And I&#039;ve had no worries buying whatever I want since then. As long as you buy domestic and the vendor ships discreet, there&#039;s like a 1% chance of the package being intercepted. And even if it is intercepted, there&#039;s no way the cops can prove you ordered it, unless you make the mistake of telling them.

				Thanks for the information!&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably just go ahead and order the bud.&nbsp; If anything goes wrong, I&#039;ll just play dumb.

				I agree, order something relatively innocuous like viagra. Also as long your source is domestic and their packaging is on point your chances of getting caught are slim.

				I felt the same at the start but if it helps, I&#039;ve made 8 orders since, all international class A substances and I&#039;ve never had any problems with cops or vendors. Just check out the vendor feedback and their reputation before making a purchase. You&#039;ll find most people around here are nice and not out to scam anyone, but be aware nonetheless.

				I was freaking out after the first order, stoked when it arrived, but I still get nervous every time I place an order.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry so much, go about your day, and try to forget you&#039;ve got anything coming in the mail
