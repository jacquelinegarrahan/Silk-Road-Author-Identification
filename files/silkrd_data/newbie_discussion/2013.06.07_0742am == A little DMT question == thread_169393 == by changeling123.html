				Hello, guys<br /><br />So I ordered 200mg of DMT freebase from a reputable vendor. I just received the item and I see it&#039;s very yellow, though, in the picture it is white. I am aware that some of them products are yellow and some are white.<br /><br />But yet I&#039;m curious: could goods be damaged on the way and become yellow? But the most important question is: is it safe to try? : )

As for the color, some vendors don&#039;t update their pictures regurally, or do it slowly. I&#039;ve had numerous products come that looked different (browner etc) but the product was fine. I think your vendor just sent you DMT from a different batch with same quality, but it is possible he&#039;s using better DMT to take a picture. <br />You should however get more help if you stated the vendor&#039;s name right into the subject. More people would help you. Otherwise, ask the vendor a look for reviews on these forums and on SR.

				Big thanks for the information, Derry. :) The envelope was not damaged, everything looks proper inside.<br /><br />The vendor&#039;s name elvis. I have no reason at all not to trust him, so yes, probably it&#039;s just a different batch. <br /><br />I&#039;ll try it out soon. Hope not to waste it. : )

				Honey, i just made the same order and, ive smoked dmt for 4 years over 50 times.&nbsp; elvis&#039; shit is the real deal, it is yellow, dmt is yellow, it is not damaged or compromised in ANY WAY!&nbsp; &nbsp;it is the real, full on experience. and i was sorely disappointed to have to buy 200 mgs, thinking theres no way it would last. but i smoked on that packet for two weeks, turned my buddy on 2 good times, and ive still got three good hits in the corner of the baggie plus the baggie scrapin and the unburned hit in my pipe; all&nbsp; thats just &#039;put up&#039; for a week or so.&nbsp; i ordered and recvd it around may 3rd.&nbsp; do not fear......elvis has not left the building!&nbsp; &nbsp; if you dont burn it up, you can toke on it for a while!&nbsp; &nbsp;keep it dry, and double down with another good empty baggie for storage purposes.&nbsp; store in in a dark, room temp, dry place, and enjoy candyland- original home of elv-es!

				Big thanks, lady meth! C;<br /><br />I wonder how much does he usually put in - pretty accurate/ a little more/ a little less. haven&#039;t seen baggie of this size before and no scales around. I think I&#039;m just going to try eyeballing the thing. ;)
