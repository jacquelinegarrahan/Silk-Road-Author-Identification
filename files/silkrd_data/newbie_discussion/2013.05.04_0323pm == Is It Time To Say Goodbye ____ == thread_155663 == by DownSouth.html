				I too was worried for a while yesterday, at least, that I might have to kiss SR goodbye. But there is many things that can be done. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 is my thread attempting to raise awareness of the many things that SR users can get involved with to try and squeeze this pissant motherfucker&#039;s tolerance for continuing to attack one of the most effective and concerted efforts to destroy prohibition ever conceived and executed.<br /><br />Part of the idea is in encouraging as many SR users as possible to run non-exit tor relays, widening the channel so the cost of the attack is raised, and another idea I have to do with http-keep-alive, to lock open legitimate user&#039;s access to the server such that the number of available connections remaining at any given time are diminished for this spamcunt&#039;s mischief. Oh, and another idea, a browser extension (for firefox, at least, since most SR users use torbrowser, most likely) that interfaces with SR&#039;s server to grab a JSON list of onion addresses. This list could be picked a few out of a pool, and might enable the user in question to be locked out, and to top that off, set up a 30 minute delay between creating an account (or longer) and being able to first log in. This is a relatively easy (maybe 1-2 weeks work) bit of coding to do, and if anyone reading this knows anyone who might be able to write the javascript code for the extension and maybe write a script to generate new onion addresses (it&#039;s just a matter of inserting lines into the torrc and sending a SIGHUP to the tor server) to shuffle around the onion addresses. <br /><br />If we all work together we can kick these slimebags in the nuts and still get and send our drugs in the mail. The solution at the end of the last paragraph would stave off the attack, especially combined with as many SR users setting up non-exit tor relays, and extending the keepalive timeout so that more of the server&#039;s connections are tied up with legitimate (funny word to say, but i think it&#039;s appropriate) users of SR versus the attackers.<br /><br />I am glad that at least some of the newbie population here is concerned with the situation. What is related by the OP was exactly in my head for about 4 hours yesterday, actually, until a few hours ago when I decided to start being active here on the forum instead of being just a silent vendor (take the 9 off my nick, that&#039;s me)

Silk Road has been online for 26 months. The 97% estimate translates to online time of 25.22 months, which I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll agree is fairly accurate given the fact that the site has up a lot more than it has been down over the past 30 days, and previous outages lasted no longer than a couple of days in total.<br /><br />I am unaware of a site that has measured Silk Road&#039;s up-time from the time it went live, but if you can find one I believe it would reflect my 97% estimation.<br /><br />Referring to DPR&#039;s statement above, if it is indeed something that cannot be resolved unless the Tor software or the Tor network itself are restructured then there&#039;s not much that taking SR down and rebuilding will accomplish.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No. I have only been able to log on 1 time for 10 - 15 minutes in the last 3 days. So I cannot confirm if the site has been up 97% of the time or not.<br />However, the site being up 97% of the time does not matter if there are only 3 good working nodes for many people to connect with.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The 3% downtime includes the past 3 days. I agree that if there are connectivity issues then site up-time is irrelevant, however I was simply stating that it is premature to suggest an onion site with 97% up-time needs a re-build to resolve those connectivity issues.<br /><br />I do see where you&#039;re coming from though.<br /><br />Libertas

				it&#039;s sweet, and all, to give so much credit to DPR and her team. but there is things we all can do. i have started a thread about it here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0<br /><br />i am not meaning to second guess DPR, but i would think that she is not in a position or motivated to get mass action going from users. me, on the other hand, i am a vendor. my sales are being fucked over by this. i am 1 transaction away from getting a 38 bitcoin security deposit back. i am very motivated to motivate others to fuck this attacker&#039;s shit up. i will literally be homeless in a month if this is not sorted out, and starving in 2 weeks (on the outside) if this doesn&#039;t get sorted out.<br /><br />yes, slack of me to not participate in the forums sooner. i apologise. i know a lot about cryptography and network security, as well as military tactics in general. i too thought that DPR and co had this one sorted, but a week of mostly downtime tells me she needs help. <br /><br />if you like what SR does, then think through what i&#039;m saying, on that post, and make your decision as to what and whether you can do anything about this. i personally think that enough SR users getting active and helping could be the margin that makes this all work out for the better.

				just remember it&#039;s only noobs in here. not all of them are not trolls (reason for the 50 post limit, so they can be weeded out), but a lot of the ppl posting in here are not long-time crypto people, the number of orders that i as a vendor field that people just put plaintext addresses in their orders, too many, about 2/3rds. not even using privnote, which is pretty secure as long as both sides use tor.<br /><br />anyway, i am a 10 year veteran of online forums and irc chatrooms. the troll content here in the noob jail is about typical. i am pretty confident that the whole point of the 50 post limit is to decrease the amount of outright trolls that get onto the main forum.

				I cannot believe how many a&#039;&#039;holes and bigots are on this site! If I ever leave, it will be because of the people, not the site.<br /><br />All I was trying to say on this topic was:<br /><br />First, If SR is down for a little while, maybe the attacker will lose interest and go somewhere else since there is nothing to attack.<br />Second, I have over 25 years IT experience and I support many large financial companies, so I know what it is like to be able to take the system down for a little while, regroup, re-evaluate, and trying some things...without any stress.<br /><br />Not to mention...Don&#039;t you think it would be nice to let DPR and people work on system without any stress. Or maybe even take a couple days off from this and return with a new perspective???
