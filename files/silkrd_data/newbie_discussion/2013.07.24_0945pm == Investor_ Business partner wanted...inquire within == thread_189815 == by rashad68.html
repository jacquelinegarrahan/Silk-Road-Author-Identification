Infact thats the opposite. Most of the drugs bought on SR are for people in rural areas for the most part because people living in cities have greater access to drugs. The drugs flow out from the cities and the farther you get from a major city the more expensive and rare drugs become. <br /><br />You are a poor scammer! Get your facts straight! Why dont you get a job! Dont try to ruin this great site. <br /><br />-This guy is some loser high school kid that cant get a job so now hes trying to take our money.

				Right.&nbsp; Nobody in their right mind would ever use SR to buy $10 hits of acid and $10 hits of XTC to sell for even more than that on the street.&nbsp; <br /><br />Silk Road is higher than street price.<br /><br />But maybe rashad&#039;s celebrities will pay a LOT more for the anonymity&nbsp; ;)

You sound like a 15 year old &quot;trole&quot; who happened to have stumbled upon Tor and decided to sound smart on such a forum. The only way we can judge you, is based on the way you type, the way you convey your message. You strike me as an uneducated, inexperienced stoned nigger who spent a year in the &quot;streets&quot; thinking he knows organized and professional distribution, just because you&#039;ve got a group of 12 year olds with bicycles in different parts of the states, &quot;standing by&quot; to transport your dope.<br /><br />Kill yourself. You haven&#039;t even taken the time to build up your forum account, thinking &quot;hurr huur nigga imma start me a biznees on dis forum, get me oen of dem suppliyers and we be makin $$ and fuck bitches lyk ASAp rocky n juucy J durr&quot;. <br />If you can&#039;t even put some effort in typing a coherent and simple paragraph without sounding like an illiterate nignog, do you think anyone would trust you putting any effort in what you&#039;re doing?<br />Its called presentation.<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;m highly positive you&#039;re an &#039;epik trole&#039;. But thanks for the laugh

You want to get peoples attention and show that you are a worthy distributor, its common etiquette to come off as a reasonable person, to show some professionalism. You get the chance to correct your mistakes on the internet, you&#039;re not speaking face to face. I&#039;m just saying, the only way we judge people on an anonymous forum (which it kind of is), is by your behavior and the way you TYPE. you&#039;re coming off to me as another brain damaged monkey. <br /><br />Brag about how many bitches you&#039;ve &quot;fucked&quot;, brag about earning 6 figures when you were 21, for all I know and care you could be another basement dwelling neckbeard trying to create a persona to make yourself feel better because you&#039;re a shallow swine. If whatever you&#039;re saying is somewhat &quot;true&quot; then good for you pal, well fucking done. But my message to you is that you should put some effort in you&#039;re account, prove you&#039;re not another pleb troll, build a reputation, plan out and think things through.. and for the love of god try to type decently? I know all this is a waste of time but nothing is easy, and again if what all you say is true, you would know that.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey rashad, alittle advice for the business world. When looking for business partners it is probably not a good idea to go around telling everyone that their &quot;mothers and sisters are selling their asses for a nigga like you&quot;. Oh and also calling everyone names saying they&#039;re nerdy guys or old fucks that get no pussy, not really a good look. For all we know that little nerdy guy that gets no pussy and has his family selling their asses to &quot;niggas&quot; could be you rashad! If you&#039;re going to recruit people into your West Side Rainbow Rollers gang that&#039;s one thing, but you don&#039;t have to go around talking shit to everyone while you&#039;re doing it man... low key... low key....

				&quot;West Side Rainbow Rollers&quot; made me lol.<br /><br />rashad68, lets face it, you&#039;re not black. None of my black friends would refer to themselves as nignog/monkey etc, both those words are extremely racist. <br />If you were a true business man, you would know that in situations like this you have to conduct yourself in the right way, any possible business connections you could have potentially made were destroyed the moment you started writing like a ghetto kid. Wise up.

You don&#039;t have to have understand quantum mechanics to learn this shit! <br /><br />But homie, all I is just sayin is dat a lil&#039; effort in presenting yourself goes a long way ya dig? no nigga thats got $$$ and fine bitches is gonna think twice bout sum 2nd class nigga that wont speak without swearin n struttin about.<br />It aint too late youknowwatimsayin? get to know sum peeps, get active in them threads, order sum dank kush n shit from da road, youll get ta know some venduhs and nigga, you just might meet some people and build ay rela-shion-ship! <br /><br />And actually, I apologize for sounding like a dick and making fun of you if you really are serious about this, and I&#039;ve already given you some advice, just get to know people, be active in threads, order shit and build relationships with vendors! I&#039;ve been here for only over a month and I have met some amazing people, very friendly, helpful. Some even wanted to help me get stuff from their country to mail to me! (thats not on SR). <br /><br />I got to know new vendors and supported them, helped bump their threads and give positive feedback on products or comment, and in return they send freebies etc. Its just a really nice feeling to build a reputation or get to know people, and get along! Some vendors say they have connections with &lt;insert item&gt; from &lt;insert country&gt;. If you&#039;re serious about it, you may get hooked up...<br /><br />Like I said I&#039;ve only been here for over a month and it may take some time for you as well, but it will be all worth it. Its difficult to just jump in and make a thread as a newbie with such a request, since this IS this internet, and trust is a major issue, but I understand you just want to find someone ASAP.<br /><br />Keep being active and i&#039;m sure sooner or later you will meet the right people, it may be the internet but it works the same way in real life I would think, get to know people, friends introduce to other friends, etc etc! <br /><br />Good luck rashad68 <br />
