				Please excuse me if this looks too pessimistic. I hope it will help others here though.<br /><br />This post is just to confirm what I think most SR members have been seeing lately, that is, things are more difficult at the USA customs that what they used to be just a&nbsp; few months ago.<br /><br />After several successful purchases at SR and similar sites, finally I had two packages intercepted.<br /><br />First one with 500 g of a certain precursor ( not liquid, solid ). Tried to contact carrier several times. Nobody knows. Tracking stopped at USA customs. Never got any paperwork. A few months ago already.<br /><br />Second one, this time it was 1 g ketamine, and this time I received a letter from the US Customs and Border. A bit inaccurate, they say they seized approximately 3 g of ketamine, given it a value of $ 7.98. Just received the letter today.<br /><br />They ask me to fill and return the last page, I have to choose one option. They gave me five options. I think the best thing to do is just to ABANDON it ( option # 3 ).<br /><br />They say also that besides the forfeiture there might be a civil penalty. Two options follows, I might get more information included, or being prepared and mailed soon. NONE option marked, no info included, so I hope it ends here.<br /><br />That&#039;s all folks.<br />&nbsp;

				Seems like common sense, but, once they seize one package, you should probably never use that address again.

				Wish you the best of luck with this one.&nbsp; If it were me I would get a very low profile very quickly, so small they wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; even remember or think of me.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best way really, maybe give it a year or two and move to a another locale.&nbsp; These are Fed&#039;s and they are really nasty people, you don&#039;t want to talk to them ever if at all possible<br /><br />If you do have to talk to them, don&#039;t, get a lawyer to talk for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like I said good luck.<br />

				I wish you luck in this endeavor and I hope it ends there for you.<br />I would recommend no longer using the address that you had these items being delivered to.

				Can you say if the K came from the North or East? Just wondering which direction is safer to order from. I&#039;m assuming your domestic.

				From Canada.<br /><br />Regarding the letter content, it says that I have five options, it describes them briefly, and I should return the last page with my choice marked, plus my typed name and signature.<br /><br />The options are, Petition, Compromise, Abandon, Court Action, Release on payment ( if not illegal only ).<br /><br />Well typed, good paper, US Customs and Border Protection logo on top.<br /><br />I think if just this one, just a bit of ketamine and ( hopefully ) not enough to cause big problem, and most probably nothing else will happen. I am avoiding to order anything from other countries, at least for some time.<br />

				I&#039;ve heard the phrase &quot;plausible deniability&quot; repeated on these forums so many times.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t this the perfect instance to put that into practice? Like they say around here, &quot;you can&#039;t control what someone sends you over the mail&quot;<br /><br />And if you covered your end and there is no trace of the order you placed, then what evidence do they have that you purchased these drugs. As far as they&#039;re concerned, someone may have painted a target on your back.

				Sorry I&#039;m a bit slow and briefly read through the thread. To clarify, You ordered from Canada and the package was both times coming from US and intercepted?

				The precursor was from China, nothing from this one so far, I hope things stay like that.<br /><br />The ketamine was from Canada. Both stopped at the US Customs.<br />

				Sounds like they&#039;re watching the address to have two intercepted from different locations.
