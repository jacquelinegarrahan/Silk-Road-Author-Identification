				Hi, I am trying to buy some Bitcoins and thinking of giving the Transferwise - Bitstamp method a go.<br /><br />I have considered buying coins from a vendor on SR but it seems Bitstamp offer a better price - Around $65 for 1 coin which works out about £42. This is the lowest price I have seen. Lower than localbitcoins.com and lower than SR coin vendors.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to deposit EUR from Transferwise into a Bitstamp account? I can&#039;t see how this works.<br /><br />Also, does anyone know if I can sign up for both of these services anonymously via the Tor browser and by using a Tormail address? Or is there no need to sign up anonymously?<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated! As you can probably guess I&#039;m new to SR...<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :)

				Another question. What is the reason for using Transferwise to send money to Bitstamp if you can just do a direct bank transfer to Bitstamp?

				Firstly, you need to make an order with Bitstamp, they will then give you details of the account you need to pay into via transferwire. Secondly, open transferwire and send the funds to Bitstamp&#039;s account.

I sent both a bank transfer and a Transferwise transfer to Bitstamp at the same time and the former took 2 days whereas the latter took 4 days.<br /><br />To transfer money with Transferwise, you will need to set up the payment from Transferwise to Bitstamp of the desired GBP to send which will then be converted to Euros and a small transfer charge will be taken. You will then have to pay the invoice with your selected method which include UK Bank Transfers and Debit cards.<br /><br />With the routing number problem, try and look for your international payments page. They require and BIC Code and an IBAN which you are given by Bitstamp.<br />

				Nice one. Thanks for the advice. So am I right in thinking it would be quicker and less hassle to just to do a direct bank transfer to Bitstamp and then transfer the BTC from Bitstamp into a Blockchain wallet and then into my SR wallet?<br /><br />Or do you recommend using Transferwise instead of a direct bank transfer to Bitstamp?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions and apologies if it sounds like I&#039;m repeating myself!<br /><br />Cheers

Add in the other wallet if you like. Bitstamp only accept INTERNATIONAL transfers which take more time then using transferwise with a uk bank transfer.

Sending the money to a European account involves expensive bank fees unless you transferwise. Transferwise charge about £3
