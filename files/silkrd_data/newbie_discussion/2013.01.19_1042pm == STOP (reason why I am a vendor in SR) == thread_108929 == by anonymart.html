				Hell yeah, f*ck being a slave to society!<br /><br />Well said..<br /><br />But..&nbsp; Preferably is to combine some kind of regular job with this kind of hustle, to not attract too much suspicion when you start making some good profit and it&#039;s visible!

				You are right, vendors who plan to do this longterm ideally need a cover up plan...whether is having another job or something else.

I love making money but our jails are businesses in bed with government whose purpose is to jail people so they can keep their budget which comes from our taxes. As a result I want legalization to happen but yes at the same time I dont bc I profit from it.<br /><br />If we ever reach a true anarcho capitalist free society type of world, prices would stay low in general and so education and healthcare would be affordable for everyone and of good quality not like free healthcare always ends up been bc competition would keep people trying to improve quality of service and product so we would advance as a humanity faster. I hope the time comes when we are ready to try something new bc what we are doing right now is not working..In a true anarcho capitalist free society I would be able to find other ways of making money more easily and life in general would be more affordable.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

				i believe like selling drugs on SR is a lot of work, too, but at least it&#039;s for the greater good, as opposed to many other jobs ;)

				And do you suppose the stress and worry of possibly being arrested and sent away at any time does for your health? Not bashing anybody, just saying.

				I got raised right. I got educated. I want my steady paycheck. But why? It really all seems like bullshit. Why not move off and build a cabin in the woods and live off the land hundreds of miles from people???<br />oh wait. that&#039;s government land. land for the people... to not be allowed on.<br />There just needs to be way less people in the world. Although most of them that I get to know are alright, there&#039;s still just way to many of us here.<br />The rich will get richer and do whatever they can to keep that deep divide between making ends meet and flourishing.<br />-tastylures

				As someone who&#039;s going to university to study and become a &quot;professional&quot; I agree, the system is fucked and I see so many kids suffer because of it as well.<br />Nonetheless, keep the drug trade alive - it&#039;s the ultimate form of freedom we have in this society!
