				Gambling with bitcoins is just too easy and addicting. I&#039;m not surprised it pulls in that much money.

				I agree bitcoin based gambling is the best of the best!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because anyone who&#039;s gambled online over the years knows what a pain in the ass it can be to get money OUT.&nbsp; Never a pain to get money in but it&#039;s payouts that suck when you&#039;re trusting your money with some chump in Jamaica or Bolivia.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once upon a time http://www.sportsbook.ag/ (formerly sportsbook.com) failed to pay me a $2000 payout.&nbsp; It was the most incredible run I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I turned a $50 deposit into about $600 after taking 2nd in a big poker tourney.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I hit the craziest bet of my life for about $700.&nbsp; I&#039;ll never forget it.&nbsp; Lakers favored by 7.5 at home over the Spurs back in the playoffs in &#039;08.&nbsp; Lakers are up 5.&nbsp; Spurs take a shot with about 5 seconds to go and miss and Sasha Vujacic grabs the Spurs rebound and runs the entire length of the court and drills a meaningless 3 at the buzzer.&nbsp; Not one other person on either team made it past half court because the game was basically over.&nbsp; Spurs players were PISSED and got right up in his face.&nbsp; He did it because the crowd was chanting for tacos which they got when that shot put the Lakers team total over 100 points.&nbsp; It cost betters $100 million dollars.&nbsp; I found a link about it <br /><br />http://slumz.boxden.com/f16/laker-vujacic-s-meaningless-shot-costs-bettors-100-million-1096480/index3.html<br /><br />And yeah those fuckers never paid me a dime.&nbsp; They sent me a bunch of checks that kept bouncing and giving me the run around when I&#039;d call them.&nbsp; They just kept redepositing the money back into my account and I lost it all eventually lol.&nbsp; Oh well it was only $50 really.&nbsp; <br /><br />Flash forward to today and I&#039;m using www.btcsportsbet.com<br />These guys are legit!&nbsp; I was using them a ton during the basketball season earlier this year.&nbsp; They&#039;ve since upped their minimum bet to 1 bitcoin.&nbsp; They sometimes take a few hours to credit you after a win so if the game is over and the bitcoins aren&#039;t there within a few hours don&#039;t sweat it, they&#039;ll pay ya.&nbsp; <br />
