				Hello SR! we are currently out of town for a few days due to **family emergency**all orders that were submitted yesterday for oxy&#039;s or bitcoins have been refunded..<br /><br />Please check the forums for when we will be back up &amp; rolling!!! <br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />**Also SR member name &quot;cityofangelsxoxo&quot; sent us the wrong address when they ordered..Fortunately we use a **Decoy Return Addresses** to catch undeliverable packages...that way we can attempt to get our products back without a lost.. Member &quot;cityofangelsxoxo&quot; package was returned back to us for address reasons..&quot;cityofangelsxoxo&quot; was&nbsp; also refunded 100%...But still &quot;cityofangelsxoxo&quot; is upset??? Look SR its very simple, please send proper addresses..If you order priority your package will be shipped out 24-48hrs..If you order next day shipping, it has to be in the night before or early in the morning in order for your package to be sent out the same day...Understand that we have lives too! We are not robots!!<br /><br />***We thank the 99% of our customers that our satisfied!! As for the 1% we will try to do better ;)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />NL22

				LOL <br />I rarely go on forums and forgot my old user name, however I am actually a VENDOR and ordered 10 measly tablets for a regular client because he didnt have bitoins and paid me in a vanilla card so I did them a favor because they iorder about 50 -100 blues from me every month. i made sure he could do overnight because if he couldnt, my client didnt need them (i was due to get my load the next day, and so they just needed a small order before i could mail my load.)<br /><br />I know how to triple check an address, and they sent me some bullshit story about how the package bounced back. They never provided a tracking number to verify that they had even sent it, and he actually sent me emails saying &quot;oh the system says it wont show up til monday&quot; (i had ordred on a friday for saturday delivery to my clients address, that i ship to at least once a week) and then monday rolls around and he says it bounced back,,,i emailed my poor client with every update, and completely made a fool of my flawless reputation. i dont know if actual people fall for this shit (i have a feeling he sold a 50 pack and didnt have enough to fill my order so he made up some B.S story) but any vendor knows that express mail takes less than 24 hours to &quot;bounce back&quot;, let alone triple checking addresses IS very important, and its clearly something this vendor doesnt do himself.<br />U can read my negative feedback on his page, i dont need to write the whole story.<br /><br />let feedbacks speak for themselves, hes had 3 negative transactions in 30 or so odd transactions since hes started,&nbsp; i have zero and always go out of my way to make sure i can mail what i have listed on my page.<br /><br />this guy is a mess. stay away. he even had the audacity to threaten me when i left him negative feedback. tempted to post our discussion in forums, but im not going to stoop to his level.<br /><br />
