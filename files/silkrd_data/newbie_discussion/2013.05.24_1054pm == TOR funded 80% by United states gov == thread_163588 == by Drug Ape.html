				I learned the other day that TOR the tool we are all using to keep ourselves anonymous is funded 80% by the united states gov<br /><br />This makes me question how safe tor actually is ? can you trust software that is mainly funded by the people who your trying to stay anonymous from ? You guys can do the research yourselves , You could start with TORs projects donation page. Whats your guys take on this&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not sure where THAT statistic came from. However, if you Google it, or even read the Tor forums, you will discover that the FBI have already been in discussion with known developers of Tor - not to shut it down, but to discuss it&#039;s justification in the dissemination of free speech world wide. No doubt the DEA and FBI are fully aware of the other functions and services Tor provides, but for now, and considering the political situations worldwide in Syria, Iran and even China, it for now poses more so as a tool that may balance in their favor in an uncertain world. <br />Despite it&#039;s volume, the illicit trade on SR in miniscule in global terms. However if any level of political global stability should manifest itself - which is no time soon - no doubt focus could return to Tor and it&#039;s ACTUAL political value Vs the illicit (as they would call it) trade.<br />Remember, we can talk all we like about how the stealth and encryption keeps us all safe here.. a simple law passed by US congress regarding Tor would certainly have an impact on it&#039;s capability to function, not only in the US, but also it&#039;s &#039;allies&#039;. Let&#039;s hope that day is far far away.

				I have no idea who pays for the majority of tor but I do know tor was developed for and sponsored by the US Navy back in 01.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think many of the people who developed the alpha version were in the navy, not sure though.&nbsp; <br /><br />We enjoy so many things today that were originally developed by the military.&nbsp; For example, airplanes, gps, mircrowave ovens, walkie talkies I wont go on but they all started out as military inventions.

				If this is true that is crazy information.&nbsp; And yes lets hope SR does not go down for a long long time.

				There;s no doubt that if SR or Tor were to go down, either technically or legally, other &#039;onion-like routing&#039; network options - which by the way are already out there, would come to the fore and take over. It&#039;s going to be a very difficult task for FE to catch up with this technology. Thank heavens!
