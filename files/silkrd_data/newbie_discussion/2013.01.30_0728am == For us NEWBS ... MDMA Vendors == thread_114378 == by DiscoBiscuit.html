				Well, we&#039;re all here either because we&#039;re newbs or because we&#039;ve never felt the need to post on 50 different occasions. I&#039;m a newb, been on here for a month browsing and basically silently window-shopping until I&#039;m confident I have everything as I need it. Molly is why i&#039;m here, for the most part. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve had any sort of experience with Molly off the Road... TELL! (in a safe manner that doesn&#039;t jeopardize you or the vendor, obviously). Include your personal ratings for product, shipping, communication... you know, typical review stuff that would be helpful to others. <br /><br />

				Juergen2001<br />His MDMA varies from excellent white to wet brown looking like it&#039;s cut with another white powder. Broke my cherry and always gets through...<br /><br />Ivory<br />Pretty much the gold standard for me in terms of MDMA and 2CB. His stuff is clean, strong and always gets through. I&#039;ve had him reship once (no charge) and that arrived. He&#039;s a classic, but you pay for it. Then again, compared to local prices...I don&#039;t know why you would do that unless you need drugs in a hurry. <br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />

				XTCexpress has prompt shipping and good quality, along with decent stealth. Supertrips is cheaper, and does always come through in the end, but you might be waiting for a month or more due to how busy he is.

				Emonkey is my current vendor of choice, but for personal/friend amounts, not bulk.<br />His MDMA crystals are beautiful. Super washed, clean and strong, but not the cheapest at $45USD/Gram<br />However, the care with which he deals with transactions, his stealth (seriously it is quite great) and incredibly fast shipping times (even from NL --&gt; NA, which shocks me) keep me coming back.<br /><br />His vendor page (closing in on 300 transactions too!)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/4ef5547148<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />exis

				i&#039;ve been doing couple of days of comparing and this is just my personal take on some vendors that i contemplated on:<br /><br />juergen: honest, helpful seller, very good communications. placed my 1st order with him but I wasn&#039;t clear on my delivery address and he canceled my order and refunded by BTCs. he first asked me to clarify the address, but i was out of town, no access to comp and when I returned I realized he had refunded me after waiting a full week for me and getting no reply, so all&#039;s good. i wanted to reorder but he had no stock left. imo as a top 2% seller with 1300+ fans and still so quick and sincere with his communications, this guy&#039;s got a good heart. <br /><br />FM: was extremely tempted to buy from him because his 5g was at a really low price. wasn&#039;t comfortable with his requirement to FE, so i hesitated for a while. and as he said on his profile, if i can&#039;t accept his policies, don&#039;t order. so decided to read up on the forum abt other buyers&#039; experiences instead of relying on price, his stats and his SR reviews as selection criteria. read a thread on the forum from several buyers having a super long wait time for their orders and some were becoming concerned. due to the mixed reviews and the recent &quot;logistics mystery&quot;, i decided to continue searching. <br /><br />fartbomber: also good price, comparatively low among current listing. he has another listing page &quot;discount shop&quot;. his profiles says he will reply within 48hrs and he really did. not only did he answer my questions, he&#039;s also helpful in offering suggestions. wanted to order multiple qty of his MD but couldn&#039;t do it. then his listing came off. he responded explaining he&#039;s (almost) outta stock but will look into his inventory and work something out for me. some vendors will just not bother reply or tell you to wait.<br /><br />mister m100: i was glad i finally have the time this weekend to plow through the MD listings and read all the feedback on vendors (mainly because i have nothing to roll on this week) and mm100&#039;s 5g listing attracted me because 1) there&#039;s no need to FE 2)gd reviews about stealth packaging 3) free shipping 4)prices are pretty decent. not the lowest but for what i can find now, it&#039;s good enough. there&#039;s hardly any reviews on him on the forum, which makes it pretty difficult for me to make a decision to order from him. (then again it&#039;s the same when there are tons of reviews but mixed ones) so finally i made my decision on what mattered to me more: the FE part and the packaging part. placed my order this afternoon, PM&#039;ed him and now i&#039;ll have to sit back &amp; wait for him to reply + work on my order. will have to travel again in a week&#039;s time so really hope he&#039;ll be prompt in his communications. I&#039;ll not want to repeat another juergen episode. a coke buyer gave him a good review on his communication. will give mine when he responds.<br /><br />emonkey: a vendor with many positive reviews on the forum and seems to 1) have good stuff 2)know his stuff 3)be competitively priced 4)offers 75% refund as compared to mm100 who gives only 50%. would have bought from him if his prices were as low as mm100 and if i hadn&#039;t seen reviews of un-arrived shipments (but seemed to be fairly managed). rather inclined to make my next purchase with this him though. <br /><br />i&#039;m not making personal assessments for the rest of the sellers because their prices are outta my league. anyone with any reviews, please share your thoughts/experiences.

				Ordered from Symbiosis and Ivory recently. Stealth was acceptable on both accounts. Both sellers have great comms and delivery was impressively swift.<br /><br />Onto the product...only reviewed symbiosis myself and thus have to take into account the word of others for the Ivory. Word from my girls on Ivory&#039;s was that his shit is fire, best stuff they&#039;d ever had. Both rolled on 0.25 each split three ways over the course of the night. I&#039;m told the roll was extremely intense and lasted roughly 4-5 hours. One of my friends reported half an hour or so of some light OEV&#039;s however nothing off putting and had been experienced before. Another friend told me it took her a while to come up but once she did she was more than pleased... Ivory&#039;s reputation precedes him for a reason, whether you&#039;re willing to pay the price for this is up to you.<br /><br />Next up is symbiosis. I took a 140mg bomb to start and had a 80mg booster that i took roughly an hour and a half after the first. Come up was reasonably soft, peak lasted about 45 minutes. Can&#039;t say it was the most intense MDMA I&#039;d ever sampled but it certainly did the job. Felt very nice, euphoria was marked albeit not extreme (bit disappointing). Roll lasted roughly 5 hours. One thing I would comment on is the &#039;cleanliness&#039; of his gear. I thought it was top notch. No sweat, no excessive gurning and an extremely blissful comedown which was slow and smooth. To add to that the next day I felt perfect, as if I hadn&#039;t taken anything the previous night. Impressive. Oh and my girl who also took it in equal amount but chose to dab had a fantastic time. Lost track of the amount of times she told me she never wanted to come down and how good life was. All in all very good stuff too, and at a respectable price. Still itching to try Ivory...<br />

				updates:<br /><br />PM&#039;ed FrankMathews and FartBomber with shipping &amp; packaging method questions and was very satisfied that both replied within 48hrs with straight to the point answers. pleasantly surprised by the reply from FM, wasn&#039;t expecting it, partly because of the mixed reviews i&#039;ve read. <br /><br />another positive find was that FB lived up to his words by relisting his MD. and he doesn&#039;t seem to BS about the MD&#039;s purity, stating it at 79% instead of &gt;85%. he ships internationally.<br /><br />no word from mister m100 yet. maybe because his profile said &quot;do not contact me unless it&#039;s necessary&quot;? imo checking if he ships to my part of the world is rather necessary. wish he&#039;ll reply before i need to travel. <br /><br />

				I am much too paranoid to receive MDMA from outside of the US. I was considering XTCEXPRESS, but in the end I went with KarmaPharm, who has 50 dollar grams. Piece of mind is priceless, I suppose.

				Ugh.. I&#039;ve been on this forum and SR for over a year, but just recently have I started to partake in both. Was going to post in the MDMA vendors until I just say they noob&#039;ed me lol.<br /><br />So here&#039;s a review of Empathy101&#039;s (LuckyLucianno&#039;s) 5G MDMA listing.<br /><br />Excellent communication: He was pretty quick in replying to me and gave me no BS when it came to what&#039;s going on. Even told me that the product wouldn&#039;t be shipped/arrive when I was expecting it to, and gave me the option to cancel the order if I wanted.<br /><br />Shipping: I estimate about 3 days. Stealth is about what you&#039;d expect - there&#039;s no reason anyone shouldn&#039;t get this product when shipped domestically (as long as he uses the same means). Opened the bag and a strong licorice smell immediately escaped. Very dark brown stuff - looks like brown sugar for sure. The product was about 250mg short, but I didn&#039;t fuss as the price was still good for domestic, and I felt this was negligible.<br /><br />Quality: Did a reagent test - instant black and it smoked (knew this would happen anyways!)<br /><br />OK... So I had sold half of it before I actually took it. One guy that bought 2g off of me, took it with 5 of his friends at a club to see a big dubstep (ew) act this past Friday. They said it was strong stuff, but they thought this was MDA (and not MDMA) as the lovey-dovey feeling wasn&#039;t there, and they were getting some intense visuals. So intense that they ended up having to leave the club early as it was just too much for them - I guess this act had a lot of lights for the show or something.<br /><br />So this past Saturday, me and my wife and a friend of ours took it at the friend&#039;s place. I think I ended up doing about .4-.5g by the end of the night. I weight around 260lb so it takes a little more for me to get where I want to be. I won&#039;t go into too much detail about the roll, but when the roll was at it&#039;s peak (peak lasting a good 2-3 hours I&#039;d say), the euphoria was intense, and the lovey-dovey feeling definitely was missing like my friend mentioned,<br /><br />BUT, I was also seeing some intense visuals/hallucinations: <br /><br />-Faces of the two people I was rolling with were morphing and changing really fast. I had to concentrate really hard on their face to try and get it to slow down enough to where I could recognize them again.<br />-When I laid down and shut my eyes, I was having massive closed-eye hallucinations - very dreamlike, and rapidly changing. When I reopened my eyes, I had a sense that my body was sinking down into the couch a couple of feet. (Very weird but cool feeling!) It was like when my eyes were shut I was flying, and when I opened my eyes, whoever was holding me while I flew, gently laid me back on the couch - sounds crazy but it really did feel like that lol.<br />-When I spoke to people, after I was done, I could hear the last few words I just said (like someone had recorded it and played it back in my head), and it gave me a feeling like I had said something incoherent to everyone.<br /><br />Those are the key points I remember. Very trippy stuff! I&#039;ve been rolling since 2001, and I&#039;ve never come across a roll that made me trip like this before! It would be like taking a roll with shrooms or acid - maybe not quite acid, but some really strong shrooms. We didn&#039;t take this with any other drug - it was a pure rolling night, so it was all from the stuff I got in the mail.<br /><br />Because of this trip and what my friends trip was like, I do think this stuff is MDA, or at least has a lot of MDA in it. I&#039;m not going to spend the money to send a sample to ecstasydata because they want too much, plus it&#039;s not like it was a bad trip - we all had a great time. We just prefer MDMA over MDA. :)<br />

				OldAmsterdam - SlickSuit and Symbiosis are my 3 favourite. <br /><br />Slick is new but a fantastic vendor so far although I went to order earlier and he is out of stock for a few days, O.A has been around for a while and his delivery time isn&#039;t the best but his gear is great and symbiosis is a uk vendor who has good delivery times and decent MD.<br /><br />Ordering from any of them is a good idea.

I&#039;m told the roll was extremely intense and lasted roughly 4-5 hours. One of my friends reported half an hour or so of some light OEV&#039;s however nothing off putting and had been experienced before. Another friend told me it took her a while to come up but once she did she was more than pleased...

I couldn&#039;t work out why I couldn&#039;t reply to Ivory&#039;s thread because I wanted to ask a question, I was sure I wasn&#039;t seeing the reply button somehow.

				I have ordered from UnderGroundSyndicate and ForeverStrung.&nbsp; Both vendors are absolutely incredible.&nbsp; I have to say, I liked ForeverStrung better for only one reason - the shipping was considerably stealthier.&nbsp; The only problems I have with UGS are his pricing and he doesn&#039;t vac seal any size orders as far as I know.&nbsp; The product quality was virtually identical between the two.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to figure out someone to order ten grams from.&nbsp; Considering bombr, but he&#039;s very new and there&#039;s not a lot of reviews up yet.&nbsp; UGS just took down his 10g listing.&nbsp; Literally I added it to my cart, went to walmart to MG the cash to turn it into BTC, came home, and the listing was removed.&nbsp; ForeverStrung doesn&#039;t have any current listings.&nbsp; Empathy101 might be an option if he&#039;ll make a 10g custom listing, but he only ships once a week so I wouldn&#039;t get it before this weekend, which is what I&#039;m hoping for.&nbsp; KarmaPharm did overnight delivery for a very good price, but ended up running out just a day or two ago.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out who to go with.&nbsp; I have the BTC in my account, I just have to find someone who can fill my order.

				mdma is basically what I came here for, and I&#039;ve made a couple of orders since then. Let&#039;s start off with juergen2001, since I believe many people bumb into him when they first load up the molly category.<br /><br />Juergen2001, i was completely new to SR, and found that this guy looked reliable due to alot of nice feedback and he was highly ranked. Quite a few days after purchase it went into transit, then after a week when nothing has shown up, I write him, and tells me he&#039;ll take care of it asap. Then a couple of days after that he tells me that &quot;oh, the stuff you ordered is out of stock&quot; ..and offered a full refund or let me wait a while until he has some new stuff. This apparently never happened, and a week after again I got something looking like 75% refund, I wrote him asking for his calculations since I&#039;ve seen lots of other people getting 100% refund in the feedback, but he never replied..<br /><br />I don&#039;t doubt that he&#039;s legit, but after this experience I wont be going to him anymore.<br /><br />AceDrugs, this guy is offering a little range of cheap samples and I saw molly on the list and jumped right in. He doesn&#039;t lie when he claims &quot;next day air&quot;, cause the shit got here quick. I had read some feedback about his product being very good, and I gotta admit, compared to other mdma I&#039;ve tried on the road this was weak. The peak was short, the crystals were quite dirty, and I ended up with a headache along the night (that might&#039;ve been my own fault)<br /><br />HIIII Power, this guy scared me a bit, he keeps talking about himself/themselves in third person, but he offered a sample on the forums and I thought &quot;why the hell not?&quot; ...and I don&#039;t regret this one second... Hands down best mdma i&#039;ve ever had.. Such a clean high, nice and long peak, the crystals were big and clean, very impressing altogether from a brand new vendor.<br /><br />The Pill Company, while waiting for my very first deal with juergen I had some btc left, which I spent on some pills from TPC, i had a great experience on just one pill (90-100 mg mdma) so i ended up ordering 5 more which I took with a friend, and they worked out perfectly. The pills are cheap, not very strong, so you can control your high quite simple.<br /><br />Haizenberg, for the time being I&#039;m anticipating an order from this guy. I have a somewhat sketchy feeling about it, but as I see more and more satisfied feedback pop up on the list I thought I might as well give it a try. I dunno about the &gt;85% purity that he claims (i read some other forums about mdma and 84% purity, but people who are really into this will know more about it), but I&#039;m really excited to receive his product.<br /><br />This is my experience so far, and I&#039;ll keep checking out various vendors as the time goes.. I&#039;ve already built quite a fine list of vendors I feel I can rely on, and expect what to get from. And this was after a little bit over a month on the road :)

				I bought a gram of Interways MDMA for his special ($20 you can&#039;t beat!).<br /><br />Shipping took about 9 days from Germany to US East.<br /><br />Package was stealth, however if they really wanted to, the item could have been easily found if they broke through the first layer.<br /><br />Quality: This stuff was on the weak side. The product was a dark brown color (similar to Empathy101/LuckyLucianno&#039;s stuff) but it&#039;s got to be cut with something. Gave it to my wife who rolls hard off 150mg and she ended up doing .5g by the end of the night and said she really wasn&#039;t rolling that hard. The last time she rolled was over a month ago so I doubt it&#039;s tolerance. Plus other people have mentioned this stuff wasn&#039;t as strong as others out there.

				So I, like many others before me, became fed up with the scumbag dealers in my area pushing Methylone that had been stepped on like 20 times and calling it MDMA. I personally feel that MDMA dealers specifically have a responsibility to be honest and helpful to buyers; the product they are selling should have taught them the true value of relationships, it&#039;s MDMA for fucks sake. Dealers should be in it to sell love and empathy, and bring childlike wonder and acceptance to their customers. No harm in making a few bucks doing so, but straight up lying to buyers, while endangering their lives to make huge profit margins is an insult to the chemical and what it represents. Having to take 8+ points to even feel anything is a load of shit, and for $10/point with no bulk discount? Fuck that, I might as well put some cash in a blender and eat that instead. I went into this endeavor with one purpose: make real MDMA available and affordable to those who want it, and make sure that they partake safely. Me and my friends were tired of getting ripped of with bunk caps, so I decided to find us all some good shit from the Road. Enter DankHank&#039;s MDMA. <br /><br />I had been scouring the depths of the molly listings on SR trying to find a decent deal for domestic rolls that didn&#039;t require finalizing early (because fuck that). I found DankHank&#039;s listings, and they were among the lowest prices I could find for domestic molly, all his feedback was stellar, no FE required and no bullshit hoops to jump through. He had around 80 transactions with 100% positive feedback, so I searched around on the forums and found relatively sparse forum feedback regarding his product. Obviously most SR buyers don&#039;t bother with the forums, unfortunately, but that&#039;s their loss.<br /><br />So without further adieu, here&#039;s my experience with DankHank and his MDMA:<br /><br />I sent him a message with a few questions, and he quickly (within ~2 hours) responded to all of them in a professional manner. I decided to take the plunge, and ordered several grams. The package arrived stupidly fast, it took &lt;48 hours to go from being marked &#039;In Transit&#039; to my mailbox. A+ communication and shipping speed. The packaging was stealthy; very well done, multiple layers, printed label, the works. Definitely more than up to snuff for domestic. The best part of the package however, was the contents. I expected sandy powder, what I found was one HUGE ass moon rock and a scattering of small crystalline pebbles. When I got all the layers of packaging removed, my nose was immediately assaulted with that oh-so-wonderous liquorice smell, and I knew I had made an excellent purchase. I weighed it all out, and it was over by .1 which is always a great thing&nbsp; :D<br /><br />After shaving the big ass rock up into a more powdery consistency, I put a few grams into gel caps containing .1 each and headed out to that night&#039;s pre-party. There were quite a few people in attendance, as we were all going in a big group to a local rave. Some had already bought their drugs for the night (boy were they in for a sad surprise). I walk in, and my close friends who knew I had the good shit from SR immediately run over and I hand them their points for the night (3-4 each). Of course everyone else becomes inquisitive, and I took the opportunity to drop some knowledge on their faces.<br /><br />I asked them to show me what they had bought for the night (knowing it was most likely just going to be the same stepped on M1 that all the deceiving asshat locals are making fat stacks selling) and sure enough, it was clearly not MDMA. They had huge ~300mg caps chock full of white clumpy powder, if it had been the real deal, one cap would have them on their asses. I asked them how much they had paid for their &quot;molly&quot; and they had predictably paid $10 per &quot;point&quot; and each bought between 7-12. They insisted that it was the same stuff they had last time and they loved it. I can&#039;t imagine that; loving paying $70-120 for 1 night of diluted mediocrity in pill form. I wouldn&#039;t even pay $10 per point if it was pure bk-MDMA. Shit&#039;s cheaper than dirt.<br /><br />Not only was it obvious that they had been ripped off, (no sane person in my area would sell 300mg of pure MDMA for $10 at street level, lol) it also appeared that the dealer they had got it from had no idea what a &quot;point&quot; actually was, and was selling .3g caps of bunk crap as &quot;points.&quot; Sadly this is a very common situation in my area. Stupid people shouldn&#039;t buy drugs, and stupid people definitely shouldn&#039;t sell drugs; it ruins it for the rest of us. I proceeded to show them the blatantly visible differences between the pure stuff I had from DankHank, and their &quot;molly&quot;. Obviously you can never identify a substance just by looking at it, but in this case the contrast between the two caps was so stark that I had to point it out. My caps contained .1g of mildly tan MDMA sand and pebbles, theirs held .3g of whatever the fuck white powder (like flour/baking soda style powder that stuck to itself and the gel caps; shit was obviously not even pure bk-MDMA, god knows what was in there).<br /><br />Many of the people in attendance had been raving for a decent while, and yet still hadn&#039;t taken the time to research what they were supposedly putting in their bodies. Yet another thing I will never comprehend; people who do drugs without researching them first. God damn. Y u no brain? Anyway, I explained that a typical starting dose of pure MDMA is between 80mg-120mg depending on body weight, with a heavy dose being 300-400mg, assuming no tolerance. Then I explained the obvious; if they were taking 7+ caps of .3g each just to feel something, it was CLEARLY not MDMA. Taking &gt;2.1g of pure MDMA in a night? Good fucking luck. The first 300mg cap would have you on the floor caressing the throw rug, and if you took 2 or 3 at once (as they typically had been doing) you&#039;d either be melted to the ground of a different planet or the in hospital with SS. After a bit more general discussion about MDMA (in the interest of harm reduction I gave them a short summary of its neurotoxicity and interactions with prescription meds, told them to give the appropriate amount of time between rolls, explained pre-load and post-load routines, the value of antioxidants, piracetam, choline, magnesium, 5htp, etc.) they eventually asked if I had any extra of the pure stuff. <br /><br />Of course, I had planned ahead and brought plenty of party favors. I gave out a few sample points for people to try it and erase any remaining doubts, I knew full well that they&#039;d be back for more, and ended up selling a stupid amount throughout the night; made my money back and then some without even selling all of it (always gotta have a backup stash). Everyone loved it, they couldn&#039;t believe how amazing they felt from just .2-.3! My closer group of more experienced friends were almost as astonished even though they knew what to expect. The whole group of us all had an excellent night, full of amazing shared experiences, endless empathy, hours of dancing to awesome music, insane light shows, and pure unadulterated joy and love. <br /><br />It was the first time many in&nbsp; the group actually got to try pure MDMA, and seeing their beaming faces and hearing their unceasing flow of thank you&#039;s made the night even more enjoyable for myself. I love being able to bring that kind of happiness to people, pure MDMA is something everyone should experience and the fact that I get to have a role in helping friends and strangers safely indulge in the blissful wonder that is MDMA brings such amazing satisfaction (especially while I&#039;m rolling too&nbsp; ;D). There&#039;s no feeling quite like it. No expression can top the first-timer E smile, its fantastic. Everyone spent the entire night grinning like kindergarteners who were just told that they&#039;re permanently moving to Disney Land.<br /><br />I started the night off by taking .2g before entering the venue, then a few boosters throughout the night (probably about 500-600mg total, not completely sure due to the fact that I was rolling titties, among other things). I was feeling wonderful for a solid 8-9 hours. Music was extremely enhanced, I felt nothing but love for everyone around me, every touch felt amazing, some random chicks gave me a massage with furry gloves that rocked my world! I didn&#039;t get much of a speedy-edgy feeling with it either; it gave me just the right amount of energy and endurance. My inhibitions were completely gone (but in the clearheaded, filterable way of MDMA, not the herr-derr I&#039;m retarded booze way) and I was striking up conversation with total strangers with ease, enjoying the company of anyone and everyone around me. Got the eye wiggles while peaking, pupils were the size of saucers, everything was amazing. Had my mind melted by quite a few glovers and some amazing dual lightshows. All in all, it was everything I expect from a night on good rolls. I was gurning like a motherfucker despite taking plenty of magnesium, but the next day my mouth and jaw were surprisingly completely fine. I had no trouble eating, no pain in my teeth, jaw, or the roof of my mouth. It was a bit difficult to fall asleep afterwards but that&#039;s to be expected. I didn&#039;t get any of that burnt out feeling in the following days; I felt fine aside from my muscles being sore from dancing for hours. No depression or negative emotion whatsoever, just a nice little afterglow accompanied by great memories. <br /><br />Overall, my experience with DankHank and his product was 100% positive, and I&#039;ll be back for more once he stocks up again. He&#039;s been moving his shit so quick lately I haven&#039;t had a chance to get more, haha. Definitely understandable as his prices are excellent for domestic MDMA, his packaging is impeccable, especially for domestic mail, not to mention that his shipping times are STUPIDLY fast. Most feedback says 2-3 days in transit, which was my experience as well. He responds quickly to messages and communicates in a professional manner. His product is top notch, I loved it, as did everyone that tried it; not one single complaint from anyone, only thanks and praise. <br /><br />TL;DR: If you want some godamn boss MDMA without the worry and hassle of customs checks, long ass shipping time, or early finalization, DankHank is your man. Awesome gear, awesome price, awesome guy to do business with.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />Packaging: 5/5<br />Shipping Time: 5/5<br />Product Quality: 5/5

There&#039;s a lot to learn about, both technologically and scenewise. The learning curve is steep. So though threads like these are helpful to noobish folks like me, there&#039;s probably no substitute for watching quietly for awhile.

				Cousin Frank has some quality MDMA.&nbsp; Not sure if he&#039;s still in stock but it was some of the cleanest stuff I had.&nbsp; Excellent communication and fast shipping.&nbsp; Everyone loved the product.&nbsp; If your looking for MDA TheILF has the good shit!&nbsp; I have ordered 5g on numerous occasions and it got to me in 4 days every time.&nbsp; For the people who didnt know the difference between MDMA (150mg capped) and MDA people preferred MDA.&nbsp; 120mg rocked everyones world all night off just one.

				Those of you in the US, just be aware that there have been TWO busts in the past five days, of individuals who received international shipments of MDMA. Both largish, and about the same size, 106 and 107 grams. One bust in Louisiana, one in Naples, Florida. Possibly the same vendor. Both were controlled deliveries.<br /><br />Be careful out there.

				Just got my first shipment from the Netherlands (not on SR). I must say at first I was feeling sketchy about getting MDMA from a non domestic source, but it came through. The way they packaged it no one would be able to see what it was at first glance. If your vendor knows how to stealth up a package and if you keep the shipment 5g or less there&#039;s little to no risk imo.&nbsp;

				Here is my review of Interways. I got my order of 3 grams in about a week to the east coast US. Shipping was very fast, and very stealthy. The product did seem a little bit weaker then the last time I got stuff from the NL, but still was pretty good. I took around .18 with a booster of .08 or so after an hour and a half. Clean, pretty much no comedown at all. I would most likely buy from him again, especially at his prices. I did test it with Marquis, it went to black after 2 or 3 seconds and fizzed up a little.

Thank you for doing so. <br /><br />I feel there must be a misunderstanding as the MDMA I send out comes from Lucky and is widely regarded to be some&nbsp; of the best there is. I do not adulterate it in any way. I have only had two batches and this is the only report of it not being strong or entirely MDMA. <br /><br />I send it out crushed up as others who have ordered can confirm. A solid brown crystal would be impossible to receive from me and I assure you 150mg would floor anyone without an extreme tolerance or on medication that inhibits MDMA. <br /><br />One other thing that strikes me as odd is I&#039;m not sure I have ever sold 4g&#039;s before, ever. This is because you can get 5g&#039;s for $20 more. I am 99% sure I have never sent out a 4g order. Maybe SR staff can confirm?

I do not have and haven&#039;t had any other MDMA.&nbsp; His stuff is white so there&#039;s no way I could have mixed them up when I sent them in for testing (you can see the lab results say it is a brown powder).&nbsp; Is there any way I could prove it to you?&nbsp; If i send you close ups of the powder and a Mecke test on the powder will that do?&nbsp; I can do a video mecke testing it there is a secure way to do that over tor?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Realized the Mecke results the lab says they got (Turquoise) align with MDMA, so scratch that idea.<br /><br />

				Hey,<br /><br />I am sorry but I will not be issuing refunds for this. I get the MDMA from Lucky, who is regarded to have the best MDMA on SR, then I ship it out. This is all I do. If Lucky wants to refund me and every other buyer despite every single person besides you being happy with the product, I will happily pass on the refund. <br /><br />You have been very rational and polite throughout this and I am sorry I can not offer a better resolution. That said, I find it very hard to believe you took the amount you said and felt nothing if there was no previous use of MDMA or other drugs/medications that have a cross tolerance. <br /><br />As I have said repeatedly and as you can find plastered across this entire site, it is the best MDMA around. The batch you are talking about was likely multiple KG&#039;s in total (with no other complaints) and my portion of that batch was at least 250g&#039;s and was made with the same recipe, cook and ingredients as the ones before and after it. If this MDMA is not for you, it is not for you. I am sorry you had a bad experience when dealing with me and wish there was something more I could do.

				I think the very first molly I tried was from UnderGroundSyndicate. I don&#039;t roll too often, and prior to that I&#039;ve only had pills. But for what it&#039;s worth, I have to say I had one of the best rolls from UGS&#039;s molly--felt very clean, with little to no come down, was able to sleep well, and nice afterglow next day.<br /><br />Yeah his prices can be on the high side, but I&#039;m much more comfortable with domestic orders and the reviews are fantastic.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the states and don&#039;t want to go through the potential hassles/issues with international orders (especially if you&#039;re new) I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with paying a little more and getting your MDMA from someone like UGS.
