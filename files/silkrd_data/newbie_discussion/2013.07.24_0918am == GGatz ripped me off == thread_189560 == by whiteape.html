				I placed a $500 MP to btc order on thurs, on sun i msgd and minutes later had my order cancelled, MP was empty so I immediately reported the vendor. The vendor account and my money are gone. Nothing else to report, I dont know if they left on their own, if they were shut down by SR , no fucking word from anybody. I have made about 20 purchases over a year and a half but this is the last, just cant afford these ripoffs

				I was lucky there.<br />I was chatting with him on torchat, wanting btc-&gt;eur but he couldnt offer me EUR, since he &quot;had no guy in&quot; country that does it. One day later he msgd me with &quot;now being able to ship from France&quot;.<br />This was very quick and made me cautious. Apparently rightly so :o.

				Yeah, he got me and my associates for a 500USD pak too. Sucks, man. I&#039;m glad that we have more money to put in, but that&#039;s just bullshit. Does anyone recommend someone else to get coins from while bitinstant is down?

				That definitely sucks... I don&#039;t know why people buy bitcoins from anybody that has the potential to disappear... There are enough people who will meet in person or companies that take bank deposits etc.

				Glad that he was banned. Make sure you only deal with trusted vendors with a well established history. If you do deal with new vendors with limited history then you are taking a big risk. Many new vendors pop in with good deals but I would rather go with an average price from someone I trust.
