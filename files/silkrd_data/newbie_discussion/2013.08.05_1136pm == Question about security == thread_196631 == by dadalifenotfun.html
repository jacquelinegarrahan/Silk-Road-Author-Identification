				Recently ordered some MDMA, but my bitcoins were from a traceable wallet that linked to my potential home address. I encrypted using PGP and send it to a completely different address than my potential home address. Am I safe?&nbsp; This is a small amount of MDMA and it is my first purchase. What are the chances of getting visited by a LE/ getting a CD?

				I&#039;m always super paranoid and never purchase coins in a way that can be traced back to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never once given any info, showed and ID, signed anything.&nbsp; But that ability is getting harder and harder (thanks to the govt).&nbsp; I&#039;ve resorted to using coin vendors on here, but that&#039;s risky cause they can rip you off and SR can do nothing about it.&nbsp; I did my research tho and have had good luck.&nbsp; Anyway, I have a friend that used to give his info all the time, and didn&#039;t give a fuck.&nbsp; Nothing bad ever came of it for him.&nbsp; I know SR &quot;tumbles&quot; coins, so in theory, they shouldn&#039;t be able to trace it to you anyway.&nbsp; And there are third party sites that you can tumble them through before they are even sent to SR.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t trust any of the tumbling.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it probably works.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not going to risk my freedom on some website&#039;s word lol.

				Really I think the only time it would matter is if something you had got seized, and then they looked for proof that you purchased it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to give them further evidence.&nbsp; In the scenario you provided, I don&#039;t think it would increase your chances of the package getting caught... just make the case easier to prove after the fact.&nbsp; This is just my opinion tho.. I&#039;m no expert ha.

				If you bought here (SR), then the coins were tumbled, and the chances that anything can be traced is tiny. Not impossible, but tiny.<br /><br />Why would you send it to someone else&#039;s address? If you get caught taking something out of someone else&#039;s mailbox, you can only claim one of two things: either you knew what was in the package, in which case you are going to get in a shit ton of trouble for trafficking across state lines. If you deny you knew what was in the package, then you you are on the hook for postal theft. There are no mitigating circumstances. There is never a reason to be in any one else&#039;s mailbox, unless you can prove that the owner asked you to pick up mail, which is something that can be easily proven.<br /><br />If it is delivered to your house, then you can at least claim that you know nothing about it. In fact you could claim that you just read a story about an attempt to frame a reporter by sending drugs in the mail. After that, don&#039;t say anything without a lawyer.<br /><br />If you are sure that you can get the package without being detected, then don&#039;t worry too much. The chance of you getting caught fucking around in a mail box that doesn&#039;t belong to you is probably greater than a package being intercepted. I have no empirical studies to back this up, but reason suggests that one is better off leaving themselves a way out, rather than locking themselves into one of two bad choices.

				Thank you both for your replies. I sent it to a different address since it is a friends house but he doesn&#039;t know what it is.&nbsp; I am concerned about any CD&#039;s or LE that will come to my door asking me what I purchased with my BTC.&nbsp; The stealth is superb from this vendor (so I&#039;ve read).&nbsp; I am worried about them tracing my deposit and searching my house (there is nothing here, my family resides here).&nbsp; The amount ordered was less than $300 worth.&nbsp; I am hoping and praying that it is such a small amount that, in the worst case scenario, I will get a &quot;Love Letter&quot; if the package were to be seized.&nbsp; What are your opinions on this?&nbsp; I am sorry, I am very new to this and more anxious since I realized my BTC could/may have been traced.&nbsp; May you all have a fantastic day/night.

				I&#039;ve read stuff recently on the silkroad subreddit that indicates tumbling isn&#039;t as sophisticated as one would like to believe. Apparently it&#039;s tumbled but there&#039;s talk that all the associated addresses can eventually traced to silkroad, albeit with significant effort.<br /><br />Personally, it&#039;s not swaying me. I&#039;ve bought what I want on and offline. I used to deal casually before the days of SR, which gives me a bit of perspective. The sheer volume of people today that buy drugs and talk about it with electronic mediums is staggering. Even if someone was tracking everyone&#039;s non-tor communication, police and lawyers are damn expensive. Casual drug users/buyers and even small drug dealers aren&#039;t worth it to LE, on or offline. Think about it -- even if they could build a case, it&#039;s probably not strong assuming you&#039;ve taken the appropriate precautions.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve given my ID to the digital wallet company and it&#039;s linked to my bank account. I see myself as one of the more cautious ones out there, but I don&#039;t see a compelling connection between my bitcoin purchases and SR. What if I accepted cash from a friend for the bitcoin then transferred it to the address they gave me -- how would I know where that address goes or whom it is associated with? And if I did, why would I care? There&#039;s a reason you don&#039;t hear about people getting busted for this stuff.<br /><br />If you really think about it, logically, you have nothing to be worried about if you&#039;re a small time buyer and take the appropriate precautions. Go enjoy some of your product and relax a little. Enjoy your roll. You&#039;ll be just fine!

				ChewbaccaDefense,<br />Thank you for your insight.&nbsp; I am a very very cautious person (I am also someone no one would expect to be a drug user) so I feel like this is a big stretch for me.&nbsp; I am using this drugs strictly for personal use and I will roll extra hard once I receive this package (;<br /><br />More questions I have to anyone that can answer:&nbsp; <br />-What is the cut-off for MDMA for personal use?&nbsp; (is 3.5+ grams still considered personal use? How about 5? 10?) I mean anyone can order a big bulk for their personal use over a long period of time correct?&nbsp; <br />-Also, what are the chances of my friend being caught&nbsp; (he won&#039;t sign for anything, has a clean house, no flags on house, but is a new resident there and has been there for less than 3 months.)<br /><br />Safe travels to all here on SR!
