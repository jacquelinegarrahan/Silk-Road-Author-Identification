				So, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s highly illegal (but hell, what isn&#039;t?), but do you think its possible to open a P.O. box under a fake name, by using a fake ID?<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard you need 2 forms of ID, so perhaps a fake passport w/ the same fake name, as well?<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t do it, but it may be wise for bulk orders of things

				You could try but it would be wiser to go with an independent mailbox rental place, they really don&#039;t give a darn as long as you pay your bill ;-D

				I&#039;ve wanted to do this to, but I think I&#039;ve changed my mind recently...<br /><br />I&#039;ve ready here (too lazy to find the links) that post 9/11 some things have changed. My understanding is that while you can acquire the necessary forged documents (photo id + another id) from Silk Road to open the po box, USPS will make copies of your ID&#039;s and send them in to be &#039;verified&#039;. I&#039;ve read that even the mom n pop shipping stores are required to do this now, too. Thanks, Bin laden.<br /><br />I&#039;m not certain what this verification entails, but I would imagine that there are several things that can throw some red flags, like name / address mismatch, no physical address, etc. Then once these flags are raised, I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t take much for facial recognition software to find your face on your real license or who knows what else. And if you get flagged, what happens to your box? Do they shut it down and change the locks? Who knows... Too many variables for me to feel safe doing it. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s the notion of adding felonious mail fraud to the list of your crimes that surely will not help your chances of plausible deniability and will certainly add to your sentence if busted by LE. <br /><br />If anyone has any experience in obtaining a PO Box with faked credentials I would love to hear your experience.

				Lol bin laden fucking seriously, I think its a different reason then that maybe the fack the government are nosey mother truckers who want to control every aspect of everyones lives and not just americans either everyone world wide, wankers.<br /><br />Maybe try a international licence and just say you are on a extended holiday blah blah blah might work

				Yeah, that&#039;s what I was afraid of haha. Well, it&#039;s probably safer to simply have them be delivered, at that point. You can always say you didn&#039;t order them, that I friend was using you as an alias or the like. It would have been cool to be completely unidentifiable, but I suppose it&#039;s simply not possible here in the US. ):

I honestly doubt that IF you can get the PO box in a private PO box joint, that it would be a bad idea, I&#039;d think it would work. Those places just want to do business, they prolly wouldn&#039;t be trying to be mail cops, and , even if they did, what could they do. As long as the package looks legit, what would they do to fuck with ya?? I&#039;d just open it in your name and go legit with it. i&#039;VE USED my real name/addy for $10000+ in orders at my real addy, mail is just mail and the need for a warrant applies to it just like other search/seizure situations.

				2 options that I&#039;ve heard are successful<br /><br />1) Setup box at a UPS Store/Independent Fax/Copy/Mail type store.&nbsp; The employees 99.9% give zero fucks and you should only have to pickup a package hand 2 hand if you rent a small box or have a big box but order larger packages<br /><br />Most experiences with the above they ask for 2 forms of ID but is rarely strictly enforced.&nbsp; Especially with the independent or &quot;mom and pop shops&quot; are just glad to get the biz.&nbsp; You could also form an LLC and open a box with that.<br /><br />2) Find someone who owes you a favor or even your local, friendly homeless person/crackhead.&nbsp; Pay them 10$.&nbsp; Make sure you secure your keys<br /><br />Also, both options above aren&#039;t classified as &quot;PO Boxes&quot; so can be used to register prepaid cards or anything else for whatever your needs are
