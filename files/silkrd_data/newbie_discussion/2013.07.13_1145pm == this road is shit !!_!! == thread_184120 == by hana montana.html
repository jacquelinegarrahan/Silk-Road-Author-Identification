				Cocaine is one of the more troublesome products on the road, quality wise anyway. At least that has been my experience. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a thread you can use to research current vendors and results of the folks that have been sampling their wares:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.msg1335740;topicseen#new<br /><br />Happy Reading!&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve noticed that NUMEROUS vendor&#039;s require &quot;newbie&#039;s&quot; to FE if that haven&#039;t made &quot;X&quot; amount of purchases or they haven&#039;t spent &quot;X&quot; amount of money.&nbsp; How the hell are you suppose to turn down the &quot;FE&quot; that they are asking for?&nbsp; All of us &quot;newbie&#039;s&quot; are taking a chance with every purchase we make.

				I&#039;ve been on the Road for about a year now.&nbsp; In that time i haven&#039;t made tons of purchases, but not one of my purchases has ever been scammed or shit.&nbsp; All that a buyer needs to do is some homework before making their purchase.&nbsp; If you are using one of the reputable vendors you will get your product whether you are requested to FE or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				OP, little miss miley cyrus, calm down and use some punctuation, darling. Like plainsman said cocaine can be a trouble spot for sr and I would check out that thread he linked you to. Buy small amounts and test it out so you don&#039;t end up buying a bunch of something you don&#039;t like. May I ask what country you&#039;re in? Are you an aussie by chance? I can see how getting packages from overseas is frustrating. Try to order domestic if you can or from an allied country to minimize the risk. And of course from a vendor with great stealth.<br />Of course if you do a lot of cocaine or are used to real quality shit straight from the border, of course nothing is going to compare. However, keep looking, don&#039;t fe, and it&#039;ll work out! :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184120.msg1336605#msg1336605">Quote from: spunky on July 14, 2013, 12:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve noticed that NUMEROUS vendor&#039;s require &quot;newbie&#039;s&quot; to FE if that haven&#039;t made &quot;X&quot; amount of purchases or they haven&#039;t spent &quot;X&quot; amount of money.&nbsp; How the hell are you suppose to turn down the &quot;FE&quot; that they are asking for?&nbsp; All of us &quot;newbie&#039;s&quot; are taking a chance with every purchase we make.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are plenty of vendors out there that do not require early finalization &quot;fe.&quot;<br />You just need to look. You can always say, &quot;Hey i&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m not comfortable with fe.&quot; Message a vendor if they do not state on their profile whether they ask for fe in newbies before you place an order. And if they do and you want to do business with them either take that risk (which sr itself does NOT recommend) or ask if you can come back to them once you make your proper requirements. Ordering small amounts from very reputable vendors that check out in the forums is a good way to boost your purchases and still be able to figure out a vendor that does you right and has great product. <br /><br />Good luck to all of you!
