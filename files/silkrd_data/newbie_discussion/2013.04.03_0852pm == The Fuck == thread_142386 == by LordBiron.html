				I will tell you that many years ago when I first encountered DMT, I got nothing out of the first attempt. Nothing. The second time (maybe 1 or two days later?) with the same batch, same everything, it was whoa baby! Dancing buildings!&nbsp; I have known a number of people who have had the exact same experience, although I never have read of it on, for example, Erowid. Kind of a hassle when you&#039;re trying to introduce friends to a new, cool experience, let me tell you. <br /><br />It&#039;s worth the wait.

Pull the smoke in. It tastes like SHIT (burned plastic) so you have to be willing to pay the price. Doesn&#039;t take much to at least get the visuals - for me kind of like Aztec art in motion.&nbsp; Enjoy!
