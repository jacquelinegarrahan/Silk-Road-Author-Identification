				Good day to all the SR members, <br /><br />Just like you have heard a thousand times from many new vendors, the story of how great their products are &amp; the service that they are going to provide. Let us skip that and get straight to the point.<br /><br />We have now released a number of free samples to members in exchange for a free &amp; honest review, whether good or bad, we need to know the positives as well as the negatives, so to ensure we get this right before expanding our product range.<br /><br />Looking forward to receiving the feed back, please come and review our products.<br /><br />See you soon<br /><br />Regards <br /><br />ToYou Team.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/79fc2b9815<br /><br />

				Well &#039;ToYou&#039; very kindly sent me a sample in return for an honest review for you all...here goes :<br />- Delivery time was next day so top marks for that.<br />- Packaging was also perfect and there will be no chance of it being stopped and it was also vacuum packed so no smell will get out.<br />- Coke itself had that lovely smell when I opened the bag. The appearance was shiny and had the look of what I know to be fishscale which would certainly indicate that it is un-cut. It was workable to chop up, a little bit sticky but again that is a good sign in my opinion that it&#039;s not cut. The sniff was clean and the hit was lush. Nice and subtle and euphoric and chatty. It was strong and little lines gave me a nice kick. <br />Overall I can&#039;t fault this vendor or the coke at all.<br />I wish to add I have no ties to this vendor and was asked just to do an honest review on everything.<br />p.s not to mention the extra free gift of some poppers lol.....so thats a free gift on top of a free gift...bargain.<br />I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE PURCHASES FOR SURE!!!

				<br />thought i would chip in my two pence on this thread.<br />bought 2g based on toyou&#039;s bio and excellent but sparse feedback ( new vendor ). I felt like i was taking a risk as they are so new, but the risk has definitely paid off -&nbsp; i&#039;m a very happy customer.<br /><br />I contacted toyou and asked a few questions about speed of delivery ( wanted it for the weekend but didnt get paid till friday) and also fe requirements etc. The toyou team sent me the product a day early to ensure i had a fun weekend. They answered their messages very promptly and had a nice tone about the replies, which i liked alot. it felt like a respectful exchange, which is something i value. <br /><br />The product itself is high quality and whilst i cannot verify the percentage claims, I have done a fair bit of coke in my time and was really pleased with this product. the texture is great, has a slight sparkle and came in both lumps and powder. After a day of use ( i probably had about 0.3 over the last 12 hours) I can say i was pleasantly but not crazy high, and that the high had a nice quality to it -&nbsp; not too speedy or spaced out, just chatty and happy. It is also smooth on the nose and has a great smell.&nbsp; My lucky nostril is a bit blocked but this may be due to over use in the past few months. luckily i have two of these so no sweat. I have tried about 5 different&nbsp; vendors in the past month and would say that this product easily sits in the very top end, compares very well and i will order again very happily. I should also mention price point , which was moderately cheaper than others&nbsp; -&nbsp; i think this pricing is pretty fair and also a bonus.<br /><br />Pgp is used and stealth was very good too -&nbsp; so all happy there.<br /><br />Really all in all i would say this was a top notch transaction and i would highly recommend.

				Like the man says no bullshit coke. It arrived on time and was nicely disguised, it weighs in over a gram and feels good. Well worth the price and would buy from again for sure. Thanks.
