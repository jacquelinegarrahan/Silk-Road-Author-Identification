				Not sure how it would work, other than knowing that a person in a city put a parcel in a mailbox. Isn&#039;t preventing this sort of situation the whole point of good stealth?

				Don&#039;t kid yourself, there&#039;s LE all over this place. They&#039;re data mining everything we post and I bet there&#039;s at least one person here with a 500+ post count that&#039;s DEA. They probably buy shit all the time just to see how it&#039;s done and just to see if anyone is sloppy enough to leave prints or anything other evidence. <br /><br />The one thing they probably don&#039;t do is make honeypot vendor accounts(at least not for chump change amounts). The feds aren&#039;t gonna ship a little bag of drugs in the mail just to show up at your door to say Gotcha! Going after personal use buyers would be cost prohibitive and wouldn&#039;t lead them to the big players.<br /><br />In light of the Snowden revelations, the biggest concern is what groups like the NSA are doing on the cyber side. You know a lot of Tor nodes are run by LE, and on occasion your entry and exit nodes both end up being theirs and they can easily follow your traffic when that happens. Let&#039;s hope that only happens once in a blue moon.<br /><br />LE is desperate to get at us, and probably want DPR big time. So far, they can&#039;t fuck us up on the internet side, but they&#039;ve had a ton of luck making BTC hard to get in and out of for a lot of people. They probably will find a way to fuck us at some point, though.<br /><br />Stay smart. Stay safe.
