				I think simple availability is one of the main reasons that alcoholics so often turn to the bottle.&nbsp; If they had access to a greater variety of drugs, they wouldn&#039;t be such problem drinkers.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons finding Silk Road is so exciting to me.<br /><br />For example, after tripping on mescaline, I found I literally had no desire to drink for at least a week, maybe even two.&nbsp; But mescaline is not easy to get.&nbsp; So I hope to find that and other things that will help me not always be thirsting for a drink.

				I know for a fact that LSD is to date the best known treatment for alcoholism. I&#039;m also fairly certain that this is a shared trend with most psychedelics. Ive known people who used to be raging alcoholics who quit cold turkey because they took a nice journey down the rabbit hole on some shrooms or DMT

				LSD, Ketamine, Shrooms, DMT are all great for depression and anxiety or so the studies are indicating. As an ex-alkie I can defintiely say that depression/anxiety lead to me becoming an alcoholic.

				That&#039;s really interesting. The last few trips I&#039;ve had didn&#039;t go that great. Not the best of acid I guess. I bought it locally and since find SR I won&#039;t be doing that again. But you guys are motivating me to trip again with hopes of experiencing a turn away from alcohol. I&#039;ve been drinking a lot more recently... Not a habit I want to pick up.

				Hi everybody and thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely hoping to get into more psychedelics soon as suggested.&nbsp; But WingWong is exactly right.&nbsp; It&#039;s the depression and also especially the fear and anxiety that easily lead back into the warm embrace of alcohol.&nbsp; For example, I&#039;ve found some shroom trips to be really paradigm-shifting and awesome -- but the last few times I&#039;ve tried them I ended up getting scared enough (even on light/common doses) to where I feel like I want to drink to deal with it.&nbsp; Do you guys think that moderate drinking is possible/desirable for someone who&#039;s had trouble controlling it in the past?&nbsp; It&#039;s so funny because without alcohol, I&#039;m often so very scared, but with too much alcohol, I&#039;m often so very scary.

				If you are lazy there are multiple studies done in a clinical environment that supports the LSD &lt;-&gt; alcoholism connection. Here is an article that references one (*clearnet*):<br /><br />http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=lsd-helps-to-treat-alcoholism<br /><br />Also, the founder of AA was an avid LSD user. <br />

				Ibogaine is used experimentally for opiate addiction, however it&#039;s been found effective for the treatment of alcoholism as well.

				Aside from realization through psychedelics, there are many nootropics that help with alcoholism. Interestingly enough, I&#039;m a bit tipsy and can&#039;t think of any supplement names.

				I am surprised no one mentioned MDMA, that is supposed to be one of the best drugs out there to treat all kinds of mental issues and alcoholism and depression.
