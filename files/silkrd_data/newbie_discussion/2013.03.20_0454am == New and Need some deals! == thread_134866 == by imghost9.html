				Hi, been browsin the forums for a lil while now and to keep it short and simple where I live In the U.S. most product available on SR is around twice as much here! I&#039;m planning on buying CHEAP (keyword CHEAP) product on here and flipping it for money IRL. I&#039;m not to picky on the product with the exception of Crack,Meth, and Heroin. So to be clear I&#039;m Looking for the cheapest/best deals I can get on SR (trusted vendors) to get my business plan started. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks and goodluck!<br /><br /><br />

				Scour the forums.<br /><br />Search: [intel]<br /><br />Sometimes good sellers hit rough patches. People seem quick to post negative reviews than positive reviews. Help correct the problem by posting successful transactions. Remember that feedback on SR is easily forged, and most likely influenced by drugs! : )<br /><br />I am also doing the same thing... buying cheap, and flipping... I am looking into Watlanboon. S/he seems to be a good investment, with professional stealth--as advertised.<br /><br />Cannabisarbiter is another one I am considering. Products look very appealing, but mixed reviews. Elsewhere on the forums is a painfully true statement about &quot;dank&quot;. It&#039;s been hard to come by. Since everyone&#039;s getting fucked up all the time, it&#039;s difficult to sort out the signal from the noise.<br /><br />Patience. Willingness to take risk--obvious since we&#039;re all on the SR.... Willing to lose a few coins...<br /><br />Most important... as is also stated elsewhere: DON&#039;T FE....

				Not the case. As a new buyer, I was never asked to FE.... put another way, no one asked me to FE because I was a new user. bcpltd required it, but that was on his/her profile (package never arrived, btw).

No, wait. I am fucking smart. But intelligent people do unintelligent things. So, how can I call myself smart: It only took about $20 to learn that FE is NOT the way to go... Ok.
