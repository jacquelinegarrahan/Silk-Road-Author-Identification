But no matter where you live you should NEVER FE early. If customs is taking forever or for whatever reason your product is delayed you can click resolve and ask for more time. Also if the vendor says they shipped it then maybe they did and customs got a hold of it. Not saying it is your fault because i believe its the vendors responsibility to insure stealth packing. Anyhow sorry to hear of your trouble.

				Sorry to hear about your losses, BUT that&#039;s WHY you just DO NOT FE&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I live in the same place and I was able to get good stats without ever FEing!,. just start slow and in time you will establish some good connects with vendors who WILL look after you 8)<br /><br />&nbsp; There ARE MANY vendors who dont &#039;expect you to FE, regardless of where you live ... you NEED TO spend more time &#039;researching&#039; the vendors you wish to use ;)<br /><br />I was ripped of by Jesus of Rave&nbsp; (my FIRST no show!) but he just told me I was lying BUT gave me 50% back EVEN THOUGH he states,&nbsp; &quot;he wont refund &#039;more than 25%&quot; of lost orders<br /><br /><br />I like MANY ozzies was &#039;selectively scammed&#039;&nbsp; BUT when I tried to say anything, I was pilloried by his lovers!&nbsp; TF he&#039;s gone ... makes you wonder just how much $&#039;s these dudes make!&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />Sadly you dont have enough posts (50) to post in the main forums, SO, find a spam thread and do so, and that way you CAN &#039;share the love&#039;&nbsp; BUT it seems you have given the guys &#039;room to move&#039; so if by say 3 weeks you have nothing, SURE, go and name them in the &#039;scammers thread&#039;&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; That&#039;s what I would do ;)<br /><br />cheers, have your first +1 for being honest BUT &quot;PLEASE&quot; drop the caps lock ... you dont have to shout, we&#039;ll hear you!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />m m m&nbsp; motek

				Hmm, your CAPS LOCK seems to be broken.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyway, i am not sure if you had all these orders in the mail at the same time, but i really think that would be a very bad idea.<br />Imagine that costums got their hands on the first package, discovered what was in it, and decided that it might be a good idea to check out what else might be heading your way! This way you would have lost all 8 orders, and probably gotten a knock-and-talk.<br /><br />Also, i think i heard somewhere that Aus was running a campaign against drugs in the mail at the moment, so you might just have been unlucky with the timing, and the packages with sub-par stealth was intercepted.<br /><br />I dont think that you should name and shame seeing as you lost 3 out of 8 packages, which seems like a very high percentage. I think this is indicating that the problem is probably in your customs. <br />Also, it seems to me that these were probably not big orders, and therefore it wouldn&#039;t make that much sense to scam you.<br /><br />How long have you been waiting Btw.?<br /><br />Some ppl just have long shipping times, so this might also be the case.?<br /><br />Anyways, i feel sorry on your behalf, and hope that everything turns out OK, because it really, really sucks to wait, and wait, only to have nothing arrive in the end.

				there&#039;s some good advice here hana, Intraterrestrial makes a good point, take it &#039;easy&#039; at first till you get the hang of how long stuff usually takes to get to you, what the vendors are like (some reply fast, some take forever! :P) that kind of stuff<br /><br />Read around the forums about security and and other peoples experiences .. you will learn a lot by reading about &#039;other people mistakes&#039;<br /><br />AND ALWAYS CHECK&nbsp; &quot;THE RUMOR MILL&quot;&nbsp; BEFORE doing&nbsp; ANY&nbsp; transactions, coz you will be able to read about all the others who have done biz with the vendors you&#039;re interested in ... and always check their &#039;forum profile page&#039; AND the &#039;scammers&#039; threads.<br /><br />Do these things and take your time (&quot;Patience IS A HUGE virtue&quot;, esp when using the Road!) and you will have things flowing just as you want, it took me 2 accounts and about 2 months of LOTS of time on the forums, before i felt I had &#039;started to get a handle on this place&#039;<br /><br />Remember, most of us posting here, take drugs, and we post in ALL kinds of &quot;states of minds&quot; ... and they&#039;re not always consistent in what they say ... (like me/us&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; ... but we&#039;d like to think we&#039;re pretty &#039;consistent with our opinions&#039; ... and rarely feel we need to go back and change what we wrote.<br /><br />&nbsp;Be thoughtful and keep in mind there ARE LE (Law Enforcement) here who are trying their best (in a variety of ways) to &#039;get information&#039; about whatever they can, and you will see threads that &#039;appear innocent&#039; (and MAY well be)&nbsp; with topics like &quot;what kind of cars do you drive?&quot; which just could be LE getting intel :o They have lots of people they can &#039;put on tasks like this&#039; ... becoming members here and chit chatting away in search of &#039;intel&#039; ... topics like &quot;what&#039;s good stealth&quot; and &quot;who&#039;s got the best stealth?&quot; are also topics which make me think twice!<br /><br />It&#039;s not hard for LE to open accounts here AND ORDER products, just to check out stealth methods and such....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WE DO NOT NEED TO HELP THEM in Any way!! :o&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Please think about what you write on these forums,<br /><br />&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; recently&nbsp; a vendor sending me a &quot;random number&quot; as a reply to my question about &quot;where&#039;s my delivery&quot; <br />&nbsp; I had NO idea this number was the tracking number to my package, which the vendor told me in the next pm, when I asked &quot;what&#039;s that?&quot;<br /><br />Later I made a comment in the forum about this and used a &quot;similar BUT NOT the &#039;same&#039; number&quot; in my post as an example of the &quot;confusing and super short replies that I got from the vendor, to my pm&#039;s&quot; <br /><br />MANY people didn&#039;t fully read or understand my posts, and hammered me &quot;for being SO stupid as to post a tracking number&quot;* ...&nbsp; and copped heaps of flack!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Dont worry about the karma, you keep it real and you&#039;ll find people &#039;on your side&#039; ... btw, there are quite a few &#039;hardcore haters&#039; on this site, dont take em to heart, they&#039;re &#039;keyboard warriors&#039; and &#039;words are cheap&#039;<br /><br />That&#039;s why great vendors use their &quot;actions&quot; to show what good vendors they are, and everyone else &#039;talks them up&#039; becoz they DO the right thing <br /><br />We need to help each other become and stay aware of this shit!&nbsp; We need to work together to &quot;out&quot; the scammers and liars.<br /><br />Take it easy hana&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />m m m motek&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />*which i didn&#039;t,&nbsp; BUT I keep forgetting that many of the people here are &#039;drug affected&#039; and probably misunderstand&nbsp; or dont even read most&nbsp; posts longer than 2 paragraphs!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the great and comprehensive advice Motek!<br /><br />I am in the same place and have been starting slowly; one package at a time, getting an idea of how long it takes to arrive from different locations and which vendors I feel comfortable doing business with.<br /><br />Multiple packages, especially to this place, is silly unless you are sending to different addresses.<br /><br />Sources tell me that once LE claim one package they put a watch on your address to see what kind of products you are receiving in the mail and you risk losing a LOT more. <br /><br />So one package at a time (although you require patience) is a much smarter way to go about it.

				I KNOW that feeling of wanting it yesterday, hana, but once you get used to using the road, you can have one or two packs a week max, that will keep you well supplied, and&nbsp; you&#039;ll meet cool vendors who you&#039;ll get on with, who look after you, and you will be able to rely on them.&nbsp; <br /><br />bbIt&#039;s good practice at planning you drug use &#039;ahead&#039;&nbsp; a little ... you dont need to pig out on the road all at once!&nbsp; It&#039;s Not going anywhere matey, and as long as you stay cool and stick to the &#039;guidelines&#039;, neither will you be!&nbsp; (at least no where you dont want to go!)<br /><br /><br />Take care all<br /><br />motek x
