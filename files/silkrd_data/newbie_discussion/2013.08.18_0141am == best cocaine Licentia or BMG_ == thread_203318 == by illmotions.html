				How about you just get some MDMA instead? It&#039;s much more cost efficient on the road, and the high is usually considered better.

Your right, Bcpltd is good stuff, I&#039;d put BMG in roughly the same category. There is also a new vendor...<br />.Surfacelord66,&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1f5c92f2bc<br />The pics look beautiful for what that&#039;s worth. He does mention in one of his C ads that IV&#039;ers specifically like his product. He has 2 different kinds too,m same price I think but different product.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of giving them a try, anyway, I&#039;m off topic.<br />Either wait for bcpltd or go for BMG . Licentia ? I&#039;ve never tried.<br />There&#039;s another new vendor selling speedballs, vendor name is emmafrost.

				Beware of vendors who don&#039;t even know how to encrypt. To you vendors who don&#039;t use encryption -&nbsp; Think about it! These are fly by the seat of their pants vendors - NOT professionals at all! You do realize why you encrypt your personal info and then using each vendors public key block so they can open it - in a box [your order cart] that Silk Road encrypts anyway - right?<br /><br />So you type your real name - like you should - and your real address - ditto - and then BANG! Silk Road bumps you and you&#039;re locked out - as the rest of the member&#039;s and vendors are - and there is you just typed your shit and it is there for anyone to see until The Road loads again and either cancels or encrypts your order. Million to one? Sure! Maybe worse odds. But do you want your personal shit out there on any odds?<br /><br />Shrug? This is why Support strongly suggests you encrypt your cart shit and then paste it in that window. I love ya all! Don&#039;t use vendors that don&#039;t take the time to incorporate encryption! I don&#039;t care if they happen to have meth, junk, coke - WHAT EVER! from Mars! You act like a junkie when you know you should encrypt; when you even have your encryption Key Manager installed and then you ignore those precautions and buy from them anyway!<br /><br />IDK. That&#039;s just my 2.4 cents worth. Downloading and installing Gpg is easy and fast. Don&#039;t over think it and it becomes a simple device! I just went to buy some smack and 3 vendors had no public key. Pass.<br /><br />Y&#039;all have a good day/night! Be careful! Be smart!<br /><br />http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html
