				I&#039;ve watched the Price of Bit coin go up from around 20 btc to what&#039;s now approaching 30 per btc in this month. Will it go down soon?&nbsp; I still have a lot to learn about the nature of btc. What will ultimately drive the price down?&nbsp; The demand for btc but there&#039;s always a demand.<br />Can anyone explain?

Good grief. This is actually the first I&#039;ve heard of the hack happening. I hope it goes back down to at least around $20 a btc.<br />And stabilzes. That&#039;s the main thing is stabilizing. For the ones that&#039;s got mega btc they are making a ton of money no doubt if they are selling.<br />

				I have a bunch of friends who buy/sell on a daily basis who have been hoarding coins for the last month. Now they are starting to sell more so maybe it&#039;s an indicator they think the price will drop. I usually buy or cash out quickly so I don&#039;t worry too much, although, I do have concerns like anyone. In the back of my mind I always think the music will stop and I will have 20k in coins lol. Reminds me of that scene in Margin Call when Irons is giving his speech..... &quot;I don&#039;t hear a thing.. just silence&quot; ouch!

				The price of Bitcoions fluctuate often but over all in the long run the price of Bitcoins should continue to rise due to increased demand unless many more Bitcoins are added into the monetary system pool of funds like the Fed does with the dollar...

				I certainly hope that nobody here is saying &quot;I wish BTC value would fall!&quot;<br />Folk, since MOST good vendors have their product prices tied to USD, as the Bitcoin rate goes up... the required BTC per Item goes down.<br />You are NOT paying extra money simply because BTC goes up.<br /><br />What WILL happen if BTC goes up... say you buy 10 coins today. (Bitrate is $30 today)<br />Tomorrow Bitrate hits $31.<br />You just earned 10 USD for doing absolutely nothing.<br /><br />As for vendors like me, I&#039;ve been keeping a balance in my Account for the past 2 months and have earned a couple thousand off the Raise of BTC.<br />All for nothing.<br /><br />Only a fool would wish a Bitrate crash!<br />

				I&#039;m guessing that the price of bitcoins is going to slowly rise for the next 8 months and then plateau.<br /><br />Purely a guess based on nothing of note.
