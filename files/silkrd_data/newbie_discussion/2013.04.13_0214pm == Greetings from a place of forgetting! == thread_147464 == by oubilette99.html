				&nbsp;;)<br />Im a newbie on the road here. I&#039;ve been a member for about 4 months. I&#039;ve made several successful transactions but, in the beginning it was tough. For all you fresh buyers I have a few words of advice from my prior experience. In the beginning I knew that I needed to FE in order to gain trust. Likewise, I knew there were people out there trying to scam new buyers. I suspected these scam sellers were the same people/person running scams off of the Hidden Wiki. Let me state this. THE HIDDEN WIKI IS RUN BY SCAMMERS!!!!! Alot of BMR seller are scam artists too! Never ever go out of escrow on BMR. Seller accounts are FREE. Scammers can leave feedback for themselves to build up their fake rep. Don&#039;t trust BMR! I never attempted a purchase off hidden wiki or BMR but, after a few months of watching BMR, Hidden WIKI, and SR and reading every bit of information I could I came to the conclusion that my coins (hard earned cash) was safer here than ANYWHERE else. IF your a SR virgin like I was a few months back, here is some advice. Don&#039;t be a bargain demon! Selective scammers will capitalize on this and offer something that looks legit at rock bottom prices. Then when they have made enough money to pay for their seller account (about $650) they fuck the newbies every time. Look at the sellers feedback; read every single feedback. Stick with sellers who have been on the road at least 4 months. BTW silk road is only about 1 year old. My first order was with Marley&#039;s Main Man (MMM) somewhere in the sunny state of East Coast retirement homes. The stealth was 5/5 the price was on par with street price and the ship time was about 3 days! Boy was I stoked! I spent the change on some lotteries to get my stats a bit higher and then came my second order. I placed a small order with Tyler Durden. Tyler is a fucking pro 8). I got my order within a week; however, my whore of a GF was getting the mail out of the box and leaving it in random places around the house. Every day I would ask her &quot;Did I get any mail? Did I get any mail? I figured it must be customs delaying my letter. I let the order Auto Finalize. That was a big mistake! NEVER EVER EVER AF or you will be treated like a red headed step child! After a month and a half, I said &quot;hey dude did ya ship? Can you verify it shipped etc etc.&quot; I said look dude, I won&#039;t leave negative feedback because that would be bad business I just won&#039;t order from you again.&quot; The dude shipped it AGAIN and even doubled the amount. Needless to say I felt he was on the up and up and left 5/5. Now here is the rub. I cleaned house after I got the skank out of my house and guess WHAT. There was the original order tossed behind the T.V like the skank couldn&#039;t care less about my mail. Now I look like a scum bag scammer in the eyes of Tyler and, the rest of SR! Needless to say if I had no morals I would have been like &quot;cool free dope, let&#039;s see if I can scam some more&quot; No no no no no no no no! Never again! <br /><br />Listen newbies, If you don&#039;t have 100% control over your mailbox (your GF, Room mate, Mom, Dad whoever) can also get mail at your box be warned! You probably DID get your order. Your other house mate probably DID something with your order. If your House Mate KNOWS you have a SR order coming guess what? They will probably try and intercept it or, the bitch will drop it behind the T.V because she doesn&#039;t care about YOUR MAIL. As for feedback, Don&#039;t leave negative feedback UNLESS the vendor really IS a scammer/rip off artist. Even if the order isn&#039;t perfect, and you did get your weed,dope, product wtf ever leave 5/5 because your lucky to have received anything at ALL!&nbsp; If your new and you threaten to leave negative feedback YOU ARE THE SCAMMER and deserve to be murdered in a dark alley by your best friend!!&nbsp; &gt;:( :-X<br /><br />I&#039;m running out of time but, I will continue to post on my own thread. I have more to say!<br /><br /><br /><br />
