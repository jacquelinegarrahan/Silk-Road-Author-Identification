				Bitcoins are a giant scam. It is nothing but a giant fee generating scam for the people who mine them. The guy I met with locally sold me for an 8% free on top of the spot price. He is using his works network to mine for them, I have half a mind to call them and say something. Why can&#039;t we use moneygrams, visa prepaid cards, barter etc? Bitcoins suck, and if they had an escrow service for moneygrams the community would grow exponentially.

				Sounds like someone needs to take a basic economics class.<br /><br />If bitcoins are a scam, CASH is also a scam. There is no expressed value in cash. If the economy were to collapse, cash would not be of any use than the tiny bit of heat it would give off to burn it. Bitcoins are the same way. Like any commodity exchange, the value is based on market fluctuations, volume of exchanges and a multitude of other factors. It works the same way with gold, tin, coffee and cocoa. There is no difference. I suppose one could argue that capitalism is a scam because bitcoins are literally capitalism in its purest form.<br /><br />Your argument is invalid. Maybe you&#039;re trolling, maybe you&#039;re not. I don&#039;t know. If you really think bitcoins should be transformed into a traceable commodity, you should probably not be using this site at all.<br /><br />

Bitcoins can be used to buy things on the clearnet, and hell, even some physical stores will allow purchases with Bitcoins.

Gox.&nbsp; You need to bargain better with whomever you trade with--don&#039;t let them rape you in fees.&nbsp; Tell them that you should get a deal for buying with cash: they get an immediate payout and avoid the fees associated with an exchange.&nbsp; Stand up for yourself before you purchase anything.&nbsp;
