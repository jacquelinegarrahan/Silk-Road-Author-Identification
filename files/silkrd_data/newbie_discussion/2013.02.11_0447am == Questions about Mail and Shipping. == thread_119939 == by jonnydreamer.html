				Hi I recently discovered this site about 6 or 7 days ago. Havent made any orders yet but would like too. Anyhow I have a few questions. First, since I discovered this site and researched it then made an account through Tor I noticed about 2 days later my mail was getting held back a day and then shipped all together for the past 2 days wrapped in a rubber band. This happened twice in one week and it has never happened before. I dont know if it has anything to do with me simply researching silk road through regular explorer browser before downloading tor. But I think it might? And if that is what they are doing my god they have NO respect for peoples privacy in America! hahaha. Jeeze. What do you guys think? Do you think they are already hammering my ass in the post office just for researching Silk road through explorer? Or is it just a quincidence? My ohter question is. Do you think they send mail to houses that havent been used in a long time. I have 2 locations in which im thinking to send packages. One is a house thats been abandoned for like 5 years but its in my grandmothers name. She died last year and it still belongs to my family in her name they just havent done anything with the estate so its dormant. So I was wondering if you think mail can still be shipped there or is it possible to cancel mail deliverys being aloud to certain houses. Either way its the perfect place to send packages and the chances of me getting caught or blamed would be extremelyyyyyyyyyyyy slim. Also my uncle bought the house next store to mine and no ones living in it. He is going out of country for 6 months and im thinking of maybe sending the packages there instead. The only thing is both the house I live in and that house are both under his name. So if anything happened to the package that got sent to the house next&nbsp; store itd be easy to trace it right back to me and my uncles place of residence. But that house would be much more convientent and not under what I believe to be the already suspicous eye of the FEDS. What do you guys think about all that, how safe do you think the house next store is and what do you think I should do&nbsp; ?

				No, I doubt they would be monitoring your internet usage. Probably just some screw up at the post office. <br /><br />Using an empty house you have legal access to is much better than using a random abandoned one. However, if it has been empty for as long as 5 years, I think there might be a chance of the local post man noticing that it is suddenly receiving mail, and then it is all up to how many shits he gives. I think your uncle&#039;s house would be a better bet for the short term, but then what will you do when he comes back? It may be a good idea to test out your grandmothers old house first though, if you can send several packages there and no one notices it will probably work for The Road. You may want to spend some time making it look like it is being lived in so it is not as shady, and I am not sure how you would work the addressing on it. If it works though, then it would be perfect.

				I think I will send the illegal stuff that i want now to the house next store because its a safer bet and I dont need to worry about post men or maybe my package not making it. Then I think I will send a carton of cigerettes to my grandmas old abandoned house just to test it and see if it makes it. If it does then ill have a carton of cigerrettes and a good thing going but if it doesnt then oh well i tried.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; So if that works ill have a place to use once my uncle gets back. I prolly wont be shipping alot of packages anyways. Im not really a heavy drug user or dealer although now with the silk road making things so avalible and cheap its awfully tempting to want to start dealing my self. But that is another story i have yet to think on and decide. hahaha&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just got another idea. Ill send the packages next store in the name of the lady who used to live there but moved out a month ago. hahaha thatll be really slick.
