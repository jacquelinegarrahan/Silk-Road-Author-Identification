				There is a thread about this in the grown up forums which is out of bounds to lil old me. I&#039;ve lurked &amp; read the forums for a loong time but the only reason I&#039;ve signed up tonight is cos I really want to join that thread and discuss that programme with somebody...<br /><br />Did anybody here see it? The title gives away the topic, legal highs, which took the UK by storm. It also had some pretty interesting coverage about finding these drugs in the post - they couldn&#039;t seize them for being illegal but would take them if they&#039;d been incorrectly declared. Seemed they were finding masses of them. <br /><br />Also very interesting interview with &#039;Dr Zee&#039;, self-proclaimed Israeli inventor of mephedrone and (by the sounds of it) all research chemical / legal highs produced since then! <br /><br />It was a good documentary - balanced, non-judgmental... but it showed the dark side with a gang of kids banging up any research chem they could lay their hands on. I have no phobia of needles but that made me shudder.. Worth a watch.

				Yep that&#039;s the one. It was really fascinating and of interest to anyone on SR I reckon, regardless of your drugs of choice. Very balanced in many ways, although the footage of the kids would probably alarm most people - still, the viewer gets to make their own mind up about it. Enjoy!
