				My wife knows i take xanax, but i&#039;ve ordered painkillers and even stamps as well. She&#039;s okay with the xanax, but if she got to the mailbox before i did and saw the latter two that would suck. Would be way too much drama! I&#039;ve got a stamp coming tomorrow or Monday, and i&#039;m gonna have to employ some aversion tactics and make sure i&#039;m there to get the mail. Can anyone else relate.

				Dude, how could your wife not know about stamps? You shouldn&#039;t be married to somebody that doesn&#039;t know that kindof shit, it&#039;ll come back to bite you in the ass. Either get off the road or get honest real quick brother.

				oh yeah gotta sneak out to get the express packages that are dropped off before all the other mail and then (it&#039;s a habit I always get the mail) grab my envelope and stuff it somewhere while I&#039;m walking in and all I gotta do it hide my giddiness lol

				Yes, lying to the wife is not cool. Honesty in a marriage is crucial, and we have that, but by god i&#039;m a man and like a good opiate buzz from time to time

				I like big butts and I cannot lie.&nbsp; Yeah honesty is important and I really would not want someone that could not understand, definitely if it is only in moderation and not causing any problems, but I get that sometimes it is just best to lie.&nbsp;

				The po box is a good point. Seems to be safer all-around from what i&#039;ve been reading on these forums. Why don&#039;t i have one? Probably for the same reason that i don&#039;t just go to a doctor and get a legal monthly script for benzos that would cost me at least half of what i&#039;m paying on sr in a month now. I still don&#039;t mind though, because i hate doctors offices, but who doesn&#039;t right?

				Whilst I totally get where you are coming from, you are going to have to factor in your wife eventually finding out.<br /><br />And I guarantee you that it will be better by comparison that you are the one to eventually let her know, because if she finds out on her own terms, that is one big out-of-control mess.<br /><br />Get the PO box.&nbsp; Be as safe as you can with it all until you can find a way through with your partner.<br /><br />I hid my addiction for many years and always wished I was more open about it sooner.<br /><br />Peace

Mine know i like opiates but would have a big problem with the H word. <br />She doesn&#039;t know shit about drugs and is scared of sr. So when I&#039;m expecting I just tell her I have drugs on the way and&nbsp; to not get the mail until I get them and don&#039;t open my mail if she does..<br />I do my dope in my man cave and she doesn&#039;t want any part of that either. But in the rare case she sees what I got and asks what it is, powder becomes &quot;morphine powder&quot; and tar becomes &quot;opium&quot;. Weird how people get so hung up on semantics.<br />I&#039;m a functioning addict and have been married close to 30 years. <br />Don&#039;t believe the hype bro. Sometimes leaving someone in their ignorance is the best route to martial bliss. ;)<br />

				Now reading a bit more I&#039;m getting more curious, I already know the standard rules not to sign, keep yourself clean etc but if I live alone is there any reason why I can&#039;t get personal small amts without having to go through a P.O. box.<br /><br />But in all honesty, I think you should tell your wife; It can only come back to bite you in the ass when she finds out.
