				If you have a problem conversing and doing business with drug users and dealers then maybe you&#039;re in the wrong place...<br /><br />In any case, maybe you should try reading the Rumour Mill you&#039;ll find a lot of review threads for vendors which will be positive feedback from their customers. <br /><br />I&#039;ve received every order I&#039;ve placed so far - maybe you should check out this thread:<br /><br />How many succesful orders have you made??<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85359.0;viewresults<br /><br />Of course you will find scammers on Silk Road, whether they&#039;re vendors scamming their customers or customers trying to rip off their vendor in some way - it happens, and it happens in the real world too. You just have to remember to be cautious. Before you buy from a vendor read their feedback on SR, then search their name on the forums to see if they have a review thread.<br /><br />For the most part vendors are brilliant to deal with in terms of their communication and delivery speed, and I&#039;ve never had a vendor that I wouldn&#039;t use again.

				wow this is crazy. i&#039;ve had 10 transactions (got 11 and 12 in transit), all received without issue, in a bit over a month and there was only one issue i&#039;ve had w/quality. i find everyone here generally intelligent and reasonable, and the vendors i&#039;ve used are so professional it&#039;s like i&#039;m dealing with a legitimate store. they really seem to care about their product and making our experiences great. i think this site is fantastic and i&#039;m not going to bother trying to get stepped on crap on the street anymore or go anywhere else. like someone said do your research on the vendor and see who is really there for your satisfaction. i can&#039;t get enough of SR!

				I don&#039;t see why you are flaming. I have seen some odd users that you can obviously tell they make a few sales and try to get someone to purchase a lot and take off and scam them. If you look around you can find people with over 100+ good transactions and I haven&#039;t gotten ripped off once or any of my packages seized. You are obviously looking into the wrong places my friend. Sorry to hear that. If you need advice on who to buy from for legit products and quality let me know.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)
