				Well, I don&#039;t have the proper post count... so I will just wing it on this forum. I purchased something from a seller in the Czech Republic. He has good ratings, he is very nice and cooperative. Oh his vendor page, he posts that the average postage time to the US would be 5-12 days. The order was shipped on January 9th and 1:39 P.M. so, to my calculation, it has been 9 or so business days that it has been in transit. I normally get packages quickly (if not earlier) than the expected date. I was wondering if this is just normal, since it is an international shipment and from CR. Also, if you haven&#039;t guessed already, I am a super impatient person X_X

				Hmm... well it&#039;s great to hear someone else&#039;s experience... (but shh about the post ;P) Guess I just have to try my hardest to be patient.. :p&nbsp; Although, I must admit it is a bit hard. I want to order more in the mean time... but if it was seized, I don&#039;t want to trigger another seizure at customs and have to go to court for the second offense. xD

				Don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; Remember, a watched pot never boils.&nbsp; The only way you&#039;ll trigger a seizure is if you look up the packages whereabouts using the Tor browser.&nbsp; <br /><br />And now I leave you with a joke:<br />I had sex with a Chinese prostitute once, 30 minutes later I was horny again.

				It&#039;s a reference to chinese food always having MSG in it and making you hungry again right even just after eating it.&nbsp; I guess I ate her out and she must have had some MSG in her vagina or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also tracking a package through Tor Browser potentially red flags the package.
