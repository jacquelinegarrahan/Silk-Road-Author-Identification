				Thanks Wobble!<br /><br />Hopefully the vendor restocks soon. But what do you mean the shipment got sent in two packages?

				I believe the vendor offered to split and send a single purchase order through 2 different packages (maybe for increased chances of getting through?) and only one arrived. I&#039;m not sure if I should get detailed but it was a decent quantity ordered, but only half of it ended up coming. My friend mentioned that he might have been &quot;selectively scammed&quot;, but I know he plans on using this vendor again. I wish I knew more, but I am a noob myself :( Like I said tho quality was superb, I&#039;ve probably only gotten MDMA/MDA that good off the &quot;street&quot; twice in my life.

				I find MDMA to be less stimulating, slightly sparkly vs slightly trippy, and a lot more subtle in general. MDA also makes me maybe overly emotional, while MDMA I still get some empathogenic effect but i think with clearer thinking. This is just my experience.

				Yeah my first SR order was 1g of MDA from the ILF.&nbsp; Was my first time trying it, I&#039;ve had X and molly before.&nbsp; ILF is a great vendor, very good communication and I got my order in 3 days.&nbsp; Great packaging.&nbsp; I have tried it twice so far, the first time was about 80mg (not sure, I didn&#039;t yet have a good scale) and I felt it pretty strong for 8-10 hours, much longer than I was expecting.&nbsp; It was different but I enjoyed it overall.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second time: I finally got a good scale and dosed the stuff out into capsules.&nbsp; The remainder in the package I decided to take.&nbsp; It weighed out at about 50mg.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really anticipate getting much off that, it was kind of a threshold test as well as just getting rid of the remainder after dosing the caps.&nbsp; But even that amount had me going for about 8h, not as strong as the first time but still I was surprised at the effect I got with such a small dose.<br /><br />When I get the chance I intend to try a real dose of about 100+mg and see where that takes me.&nbsp; At my doses I feel like I got a lot of body high but not much visuals.&nbsp; The first time I did see minor visuals and watched some trippy videos which definitely showed me the stuff was working.&nbsp; The second time I got no visuals at all, just the body effect.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing where a higher dose takes me.<br /><br />I highy recommend ILF.&nbsp; Very nice person and great transaction.

				Thanks ftjoowqijf!<br /><br />I&#039;m checking out ILF. I&#039;m almost thinking of getting some and putting a tiny bit in with some mdma capsules so it&#039;s a 1/2:1 ratio.

				I also give a +1 to The ILF.&nbsp; Based on what brain receptors the drugs have the most affinity for, MDA is more visual than MDMA, MDMA is more of an empathogen (love drug).&nbsp; But both have both effects just to different degrees.&nbsp; And of course individual experience depends a lot on the skill and integrity of the chemist (meaning is what you think is MDMA really MDMA, vs. MDMA + impurities + adulterants like caffeine?)&nbsp; &nbsp;So that&#039;s how pure M.D.A. and MDMA are supposed to be different based on their chemistries, but individual experiences may differ from that.

				The ILF has some really good MDA.&nbsp; People in my area prefer 120mg of MDA capped than 150mg of pure dutch MDMA.&nbsp; One dose of MDA had people going all night and they were more than happy.&nbsp; With the MDMA people only got off for 3 hours or so.

				Yes, the ILF all the way! ! They are great, hands down. I plan on doing&nbsp; 50/50 MDMA/MDA once my MDMA order gets in. May have to re-dose on the MDMA though since it only lasts half the time. Plenty of experience with both, but never the opportunity to try both at once. Also a gram of some good Psilocybe Cubensis makes for a fun trip, social shrooming ;-) <br /><br />mushmold
