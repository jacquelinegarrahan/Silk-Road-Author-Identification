				So I placed my first order and it&#039;s in transit.&nbsp; Guessing it will be here wed or thurs.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of freaking out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten anabolics shipped here before with no issue and didn&#039;t feel scared at all but this is different.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure everything will be fine but there&#039;s always that chance.&nbsp; Anyone have this feeling on their first order and how did you calm yourself down?

				I remember my first order on here. It was kinda a weird rush. I was in the house when the postman dropped the package through the door i remember thinking &quot;oh my god, it&#039;s here&quot; <br /><br />Now i love getting my package&#039;s in the post, even done couple international orders as well. I actually prefer SR to real life connections. <br /><br />But anyways your be fine, most vendors on here have been doing this a long time so they know what their doing.

				Ya staying with ordering from whatever country you reside in definetly makes everything feel safer, but in all reality, you are safe either way, all will be fine. I personally have never lost a package.

				trust your instincts, always look for something out of the ordinary but once you get your bearings you wont be as paranoid, just don&#039;t get too comfortable down the road. As much as we are giving a big fuck you to prohibition it sadly still exists, don&#039;t forget that&nbsp;

				I get nerves too but what I usually think about is the odds of getting busted from a package sent to you in the mail with millions of other packages are much smaller than you going to a physical location in your area to pick up drugs because most of those locations are probally under suspicion.

				I didn&#039;t have jitters because I did my research and use reputable vendors and after tens of thousands of successful shipments, let alone domestic ones, I&#039;d be silly to worry. <br /><br />Research and knowledge is how you overcome jitters.

As I think someone said it helps keep you alert and from getting complacent. Personally I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be completely blase about receiving.

				Don&#039;t sign for a package. Read about plausible deniability&nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability<br /><br />Also check the wiki and forums here - there are quite a few good tips.<br /><br />If you are really paranoid why not let the package lay closed for a day or two - if nothing happens after a few days the probability of you getting busted is getting asymptotically close to 0<br />

I actually let mine lay for an hour or so then it gets to be like Xmas morning when I was a kid and that pkg gets opened.
