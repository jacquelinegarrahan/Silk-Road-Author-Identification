				@s1llyn355 I hadn&#039;t read the seller&#039;s guide until you posted it.&nbsp; I found it very interesting to know what rules vendors must follow.&nbsp; It will definitely help in choosing a safe vendor to do business with :)

				I&#039;m currently in the process of figuring out a way to enter the Bitcoin world completely anonymously, leaving no trace whatsoever. So far I&#039;ve not been having fun!<br /><br />I can&#039;t get on #bitcoin-otc because I need a services account before I can log in via Tor, open proxies are blocked. Bitmit won&#039;t let me sign up via Tor or with a Tormail account. It&#039;s not possible to sign up to bitcointalk.org via Tor either, proxychains does appear to work there but it&#039;s a pig to get set up and find a working proxy.<br /><br />I can&#039;t pay people to create accounts for me because I&#039;d need some Bitcoins first. My goal is to get $500 worth of BTC so I can become a vendor here, then once I&#039;m profitable I&#039;ll stay inside the system spending my money on drugs and anonymous services.<br /><br />

				@quixotist if you sign up for an account with blockchain.info you can make deposits using cash.&nbsp; Here is a quick guide on how to do it without revealing any personal info. <br /><br />1. sign up for the account at blockchain.info by clicking wallet in the upper right hand corner then click &quot;Start A New Wallet&quot; on the next page (located to the upper left)<br />2. once you have created a new wallet using a fake email that you can access go to Wallet again then click &quot;Login Now&quot; then &quot;Open Wallet&quot; on the next page.<br />3. after opening your wallet click cash deposit on the right of the screen.&nbsp; It will redirect you to zipzap for a cash deposit.&nbsp; Follow the steps through using fake information but keep track of all the info you use and make sure you use the same email you signed up with for blockchain if it asks as you will need to access your email.&nbsp; Proceed to the bottom of the page and after you submit it will ask you to launch something and the tor browser will warn you that it is possibly unsafe.&nbsp; To get around this CANCEL it.&nbsp; Then wait 5 minutes and you&#039;ll receive an email with all your information you need.<br /><br />4. at this point head on down to your local walmart and pickup a small stack of Blue MoneyGram Express Payment Service forms to fill out at home.&nbsp; Fill in your fake information along with the details for zipzap (obtained from your email) like the receive code account number, company name and city/state.&nbsp; Take the form back to walmart with cash or have a friend do it for you to remain even further anonymous.&nbsp; Walmart won&#039;t ask for your ID, if they do I read you are supposed to just tell them that the last person didn&#039;t ask you and that you forgot it.&nbsp; I can attest that when I did my first deposit they did not ask me for my ID.&nbsp; <br /><br />At&nbsp; this point your deposit should show up within a few minutes, now you can access your bitcoins in your blockchain.info account.&nbsp; Send them around to some free wallets if you want to tumble your money up a bit.&nbsp; I won&#039;t cover that here as it is different for each provider you want to tumble with, otherwise you can just send them straight to SR and you&#039;re done.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please note that deposits to your SR account generally take an hour or so to verify funds and show up.&nbsp; I hope this helped a bit, I learned a lot of this from browsing other posts.&nbsp; About the only original content here is the CANCEL suggestion for running the external app.&nbsp; I figured that out by accident because I didn&#039;t want to compromise my identity with external software and then saw the email come through minutes later.<br />

				I forgot one thing, when making your deposit at wal-mart another helpful tip I read in another forum post is to tell them you are paying a bill IF they ask.&nbsp; Otherwise just let them do their job, it&#039;s not illegal to deposit money :)

				Thanks for the info JohnMaddox but unfortunately I&#039;m in the UK where anti-money laundering is strong and CCTV is everywhere. I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable putting money into a bank.<br /><br />I&#039;m really looking for a method where I don&#039;t make any financial transactions, cash in the post would be ideal (I was going to list some pounds sterling on Bitmit) because as far as the post office know I&#039;m just sending a letter by registered post.<br /><br />I have other options but they all involve doing morally gray things for the money, I don&#039;t want to cash in by ripping people off; it&#039;s not like I need the money, living off the grid is just a new hobby for me.

Have previously used www.spendbitcoins.com.au As far as I can tell totally anonymous. You do have to use an email as part of the process but it&#039;s just a matter of setting one up for the transaction.

				Guys I think most of don&#039;t know or forgot to mention localbitcoins.com , its pretty simple they got plenty options to sell and buy, with cash or with bank, you can arrange a meet with seller/buyer, both bring a laptop and wifi and you should be good. <br /><br /><br />

				Hey Chronos, don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll accept visa. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but paying by cash over the counter is pretty anonymous. You&#039;re basically depositing into their account and quote a reference no.
