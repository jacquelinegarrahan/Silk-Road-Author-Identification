				I can&#039;t stop thinking about DPR and the Road.<br /><br />Where&#039;s the media footage of Ulbricht in court? Of the fbi agents patting themselves on the back? <br /><br />Protests outside the coffee shop where they got his IP?<br /><br />Vigils outside the public library where they nabbed him?<br /><br />&quot;Best friend&quot; Pinnell, swooping in w a hot shot lawyer?<br /><br />Defense fund raised in BitCoins?<br /><br />Are people worried about being outed and identified with The Road? Or being labeled as a sympathizer for a possible &quot;murder for hire&quot; scheme? This feels like scare tactics to prevent DPR&#039;s martyrdom. Fear and character assassination will seal the case against him.<br /><br />The whole &quot;meditating on life in prison&quot; thing - still processing that one. Is it a life worth living if you&#039;re not willing to die for what you believe in? <br /><br />I&#039;m just projecting here, but you can almost see the birth of SR when he talks about a broken heart, experience with psychedelics, and shippers from China, in that heart-to-heart he had w/ Pinnell. In that discussion, I get the impression Pinnell is willing to hang up his dreams and ambitions to settle into a &quot;middle of the road&quot; life, but Ulbricht is saying &quot;fuck it, there&#039;s no turning back.&quot;<br /><br />More projecting and speculating - but if people still think Ulbricht wasn&#039;t the original DPR, and Ulbricht was lured into coming to live in SF because of a business proposition, isn&#039;t Pinnell an obvious person of interest as source of said &quot;business proposition&quot;? According to their talk, Pinnell did the convincing to get Ulbricht to make the move.<br /><br />I hope his defense turns out to be as revolutionary as the Silk Road was.<br /><br />In solidarity DPR.<br /><br />

				I bought 3 bitcoins on the 26th at app. 00.15am and transferred them to my SR account. I needed 5 but some new anti money laundering policy has been implemented on the site I get my bitcoins only allowed a purchase of 3 in a 24hr period. This month I could only buy 3 instead of the five I required. I slimmed down the order to suit 3 and placed it. 24hrs later I purchased another 2 bitcoins and placed the remainder of my order. <br />On Friday the first order arrived, all of it including one item that was not illegal. This came from plutopete. I was expecting the second order the next day. Thats a week ago now. One of the items on the second order was also from plutopete, again not illegal. In total I lost 8.5g of smoke. I dont mind that if Im to be honest but what I do mind is that no parcels get delivered to my house anymore. I ordered other items not via SR, but a perfectly legal online store for my childs birthday and they never arrived either. <br />So heres my two cents: The site was hacked some time ago. Probably the last time it wend down a few weeks ago. A script of some kind was installed. This collected details of sales, e-mails, etc. When the feds in America had as much info as they wanted they lifted DPR. In or about the same time in the UK plutopete was lifted. The installed program/script/virus kicked in sometime between the 26th and 27th of last month. This took complete control of the server. I spoke to plutopete about my order before the server was lost. He couldnt understand why my second order had not arrived, in fact he knew nothing at all about the second order. I suspect the script stopped orders from going to vendors and re-directed the names and addresses to their servers while at the same time marking the order as &#039;in transit&#039;.<br />Very clever feds and UK (M15? M16? whoever). You stung me for Â£180, if I was planning a scam like that I would have taken all 5 bitcoins but thats just me.<br />Let me spit in your face now. I always used my real name and real address because I dont give a flying F*U*C*K* that you know I smoke ganja. Arrest me and throw away the key and let your tax money pay for my room and board for as long as you like. While your doing it you can suck the cheese of my bell end. Back to buying of the ........ wait for it...........terrorist gangs here in Northern Ireland. You dumb government muppets are keeping terrorism alive. Well done, pats on the back all around.
