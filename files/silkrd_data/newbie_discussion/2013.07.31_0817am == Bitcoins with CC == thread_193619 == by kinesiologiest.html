				Are there any sites that are legitimate that will allow people to purchase Bitcoins via credit cards?&nbsp; I find the whole process of getting Bitcoins complex (sorry).&nbsp; I&#039;ve read guides and have done searches and I am wondering if there is an easy (yet secure) way! I am very new to SR and would greatly appreciate the help from fellow SR members.&nbsp; Have a great day and be safe!

				Not a chance in hell. Since you can do chargebacks with cc nobody will take them. Same with paypal. Getting coins are a bitch now-a-days.

				There probably is but would highly suggest against it. Bitcoins are meant to be anonymous. Using a credit card will just leave a paper trail linking the BTC right back to you. Go to localbitcoins.com and find someone that accepts bank deposit. It&#039;s real easy. He will give you his account number and some other info and you go to the bank that you guys agreed on and fill out a deposit slip to put cash straight into his bank account. It&#039;s not that difficult.

				localbitcoins is not good for me because of location (reside in Hawaii) and there are little to no vendors.&nbsp; I have tried contacting the few and none have responded.&nbsp; Sorry if I sound stupid, I&#039;m very new here :p also thank you for your advice and comments!

My favorite place in the world. Anyway, state doesn&#039;t matter. Most people who accept bank deposits use big banks such as Bank of America,Chase,Wells Fargo,etc. Find one that accepts bank deposits from a bank closest to you. For example, if a guy lives in new york and accepts bank deposits for Bank of America, you can go to the closest Bank of America near you and deposit the money. It doesn&#039;t have to be in the same state. I actually went on there today and saw someone accepting PayPal. Just look around the site, many payment options to choose from.
