				There are far better vendors out there. I will slowly update this thread with our conversations so it gets to be seen by everyone. <br /><br />If you notice, he answers my questions about money and finalizing but as time goes on,&nbsp; he becomes more and more silent and withdrawn. <br /><br />SON OF A BITCH FUCKING COCKSUCKER<br /><br />Yes I did FE. FUCK ME!!!!!<br /><br />He will not respond to me at all now. This isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve ordered from him. It&#039;s like the sixth or seventh time.

				This is truly cruel what you are doing&nbsp; --&nbsp; optikai0110 <br /><br />I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I trusted you completely with my money. I FE&#039;d, no fucking problem. Now I am getting the silent treatment.<br /><br />You told me that you would get in touch with me tomorrow but you never did. Mate, I didn&#039;t ever receive the fucking packages. They simply were not in there. Since this was a no show. Could you at least split the difference at 50%? I am willing to take half of what I am actually owed.<br /><br />This is not how you treat people. This is not how you treat large purchasing customers.<br /><br />I have literally poured my heart out and given you some very personal details about my life. Why would I do that?<br /><br />Why won&#039;t you give me my products? I really need my money back as well.<br /><br />I tell you what, you give me my money back and well deal together at another time. I will stop this campaign against you.<br /><br />I swear to god, hand on bible, may my sons lives be cut short and die if I am lying. I swear on my entire family&#039;s welfare and health that I did not receive your packages. I am sure you see my intention.<br /><br />Don&#039;t for one second doubt me. Because I honestly do not have it in me to do such a thing to anyone. Believe me, I would of been ecstatic and very thankful if the product would have come in. But you have me by the balls because I FE&#039;d.<br /><br />Please be more engaging with me regarding this. Look at how much time I spend trying to get to you and make things right. I spend all day writing you messages. Day after day. There can only be one explanation to this that I don&#039;t want time to pass and you just put it on the back burner. Would someone who already received their meth go through all this trouble? I swear to god I wish that I had received those packages!!!!<br /><br />JUST PLEASE THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING. THINK ABOUT MY WORDS AND LISTEN TO YOUR INSTINCT.<br /><br />You have no idea how important this money is to us. If you did you might actually have a conversation with me. I have sat here on the computer for days on end, waiting to hear a response from you.<br /><br />You promised resolution and you promised that you would contact me. Why haven&#039;t you kept your word.<br /><br />Don&#039;t force my hand to do things that makes this transaction a regret.<br /><br /><br />We converse until a conclusion, or I will make sure of certain things&nbsp; --&nbsp; optikai0110<br /><br /><br />&quot;We do really need to resolve this mate asap as i don&#039;t like these situations especially when im in here to build a solid reputation on trust and honesty!!&quot;<br /><br />Was exactly what you told me a couple of days ago. yet there has been no movement toward resolution. Tell me like a man what&#039;s going on. I can handle it.<br /><br />I wish you would have seen our faces when we opened the box, it was like bewilderment crossed with pure confusion. We did not find it funny and thought it was a practical joke. Right after that, I placed the box beneath my bed because there were no packages inside that box. I tried to inspect later to see if I missed anything but I already told you how that went. Even went so far as to make a video.<br /><br />Oh, and I just received a half gram package. But where is my other 14 grams. WHERE IS IT? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??<br /><br />You seemed to have stopped replying to me which leaves me no choice but to continually report you to SR and take back my 5/5 and turn it into 1/5 across the board. Also, I will be starting a new thread that will receive constant updates regarding our transaction. I will even create many many accounts to report you to SR. I will also email SR support updating them to your lack of delivering a product which didn&#039;t cost $10. $1500 to be exact.<br /><br />There is a difference between a threat and being diplomatic. You could come to certain terms with me or I will use every single option I have at my disposal to seek the justice that I deserve. I&#039;ve given you days over deadlines but you still don&#039;t respect me as a customer. You cheated me out $1500. This calls for some responsibility to surface.<br /><br />I am sorry I have to do this but I will launching an ad campaign soon if no communication is established. You are not taking me seriously enough.<br />______________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Need to talk ASAP&nbsp; --&nbsp; optikai0110 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/88039ebfeb)<br /><br />purchase transaction #916ff070af ฿-13.09 ฿1.27 August 13, 2013, 11:09 am UTC<br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br />status: finalized<br />buyer: optikai0110<br />seller: happyman 4.5<br />item: 14 grams of pure crystal meth<br />quantity: 1<br />shipping: overnight next day delivery<br />postage: ฿0.3023<br />total price: ฿13.0870<br />ordered: August 13, 2013, 11:09 am UTC<br />shipped: August 14, 2013, 9:22 am UTC<br />finalized: August 14, 2013, 9:27 am UTC<br />&nbsp;:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(<br /><br /><br />status: finalized<br />buyer: optikai0110<br />seller: Three 4.7<br />item: 10 Grams Pure Crystal Meth Methamphetamine INTL<br />quantity: 1<br />shipping: International<br />postage: ฿0.2600<br />total price: ฿5.8315<br />ordered: August 1, 2013, 12:16 pm UTC<br />shipped: August 3, 2013, 5:07 am UTC<br /><br />status: finalized<br />buyer: optikai0110<br />seller: his royal highness 4.9<br />item: The Fire. 7 grams Crystal Meth<br />quantity: 1<br />shipping: international FCM<br />postage: $4.88<br />total price: $420.72<br />ordered: August 1, 2013, 12:23 pm UTC<br />shipped: August 1, 2013, 1:19 pm UTC<br />finalized: August 1, 2013, 1:43 pm UTC<br /><br />status: finalized<br />buyer: optikai0110<br />seller: Miss Demeanor 5.0<br />item: Crystal Meth / 7 Grams / Australia<br />quantity: 1<br />shipping: Free<br />postage: ฿0.0000<br />total price: ฿4.7451<br />ordered: August 1, 2013, 5:01 pm UTC<br />shipped: August 1, 2013, 5:33 pm UTC<br />finalized: August 1, 2013, 6:00 pm UTC<br /><br />status: finalized<br />buyer: optikai0110<br />seller: happyman 4.5<br />item: 0.5g ( 1/2 gram ) of high quality crystal meth<br />quantity: 2<br />shipping: 1st class<br />postage: ฿0.1832<br />total price: ฿1.7300<br />ordered: August 2, 2013, 11:35 am UTC<br />shipped: August 3, 2013, 5:05 am UTC<br />finalized: August 7, 2013, 5:53 am UTC<br /><br /><br />Feel free to contact any of these individuals to check how my transaction went with them and this will give you a picture of how I conduct myself. I need this resolved quickly mate. I have been waiting going on two weeks now for my order. Now you can either pay me back my money or give to me what you owe me. I&#039;ve stated to you enough about those fucking packages and how I&#039;ve not received them. I paid for them why can I not have it? ???<br /><br />Let me give you some insight as to how I cannot be lying about the packages. The parcel I was expecting from you wasn&#039;t expected until Monday, remember? Saturday I received the box. My wife and I thought it was a prank. We found it childishly amusing. I had no earthly idea who sent the box. Think about it. Why would I place it beneath my bed for two days?<br /><br />For your sake as well as mine, please release to me what you owe me. I am begging you. I keep telling you that we go back far to long for me to EVER do something like this to you. I wouldn&#039;t cheat anyone out of anything. I have a complex about stealing. Our house was burgled while we were on vacation a long time ago and I remember feeling disgusted that someone actually went through our belongings. I was raised and brought up to work for what I have and respect others at all costs. My wife has never done a drug in her life. She is Asian and does not do drugs at all. Neither of us smoke, I drink beer on occasion. She condones what I do because I am without a job because of my visa status at the moment. We have serious bills to pay with that money that I am using to flip. It&#039;s unethical and risky but it&#039;s what I have to do at the moment to keep ourselves afloat.<br /><br />My wife is one of the greatest people you could ever meet. She would not allow such a thing to happen to you. She would literally protect YOU from my actions if I were to steal from you. Thats her character mate!!!! If she had seen the packages as well as knowing that I am begging you to give to me what I paid at the same time (ie trying to scam you) she would be livid and angry at me to the point where she would make me return it and apologize. She keeps asking me, &quot;Do you think he is going to send our stuff&quot;? My reply is that I think so.<br /><br />My wife was raised in Buddhism and she is a firm believer in Karma. Mate, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to please make this right. We all know the difference between right and wrong and I think you already know something is wrong.<br /><br />Look at these transactions I just sent to you. Not one of these had a problem during or after the transaction. Why would I start with you? It just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />If I got caught running a scam on SR I would be permanently banned and my reputation would be destroyed. I would literally have to begin all over with a new account. I use this account proudly because it shows my true past performance. MATE PLEASE MAKE THIS RIGHT.<br />__________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/88039ebfeb) I need to know what&#039;s going on!!! You forgot about me. Keep me in the loop on everything. I would like to know what your decision was. I thought we were close to a resolution. Aren&#039;t we close to a resolution? We simply must for the sake of both of our time and reputations. Do you want to keep haing to deal with me on this situation? I bet you don&#039;t. I will not stop until I get what I paid for or my money back.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I have deadlines and a schedule to meet my friend and this transaction is way over due.

				__________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds fantastic. I&#039;m not worried about the decision because I don&#039;t have it in me to ever do such a thing to anyone. And a fellow vendor at that. The bags were either taken out right after you packaged them or the mailman is psychic. For two days I didn&#039;t know who the box was from. That alone proves that I never received the packages. Someone else handled the package, knowing the contents and took advantage of the situation. I don&#039;t care how many times he or she says that it wasn&#039;t them, is flat our telling a complete lie. Someone knows exactly what happened. They know. It&#039;s deductive reasoning. Truly place yourself inside my shoes. Would a person who is just trying allegedly to run a scam go through this much trouble? Look back at our track record overall. I think that because I am on a so called &quot;blacklist&quot;, it makes me look like a scammer or someone who would steal from another person. I already explained to you why I was on a &quot;blacklist&quot;. Which is no reason at all. Me being on a blacklist, would therefore automatically create a negative image of myself when in fact I hold exquisite stats. You know how I get angry sometimes and threaten only because I am so honest with everyone and sometimes don&#039;t receive the same respect. The vendor who blacklisted me didn&#039;t want to give me a refund that he owed me. I still have the letter from the Border Control Agency telling me that they confiscated 7 grams. My point is that I never have to FE for anything because of my stats. Whoever took it might of been thinking that since I was on a blacklist, I could be fucked over and you would not believe me.<br /><br />Not once have I gone outside the rules of SR. I have always been straight forward, honest and cheerful with everyone. Yes there can be an exception because I have a South Louisiana temper. That does not mean I don&#039;t know how to conduct a successful business transaction professionally, which is truly my first goal. No one in their right mind would go through the trouble that I have had to convey to you in order for you to understand and believe that I would ask god to strike my family down if I were lying.<br /><br />It really only takes logic to come to the conclusion. You don&#039;t know very well, therefore you find it hard to trust my word. I can completely understand this.Would a person who was guilty be a bit shy about all of this or would he be open and forthcoming about it all?<br /><br />The truth is for the last time, is that I never received my order. You were just as surprised as I were when you found out. This tells me that you delegated the responsibility to someone else to ship it if I am not mistaken. Someone knows this and has my meth. It surely would not have come out in the post. They couldn&#039;t admit to such a theft. Whoever they are!!<br /><br />I can write alll day about this experience but you have a decision to make. <br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi, i wil be having a meeting with my seniors this evening about your parcel, if i fdont get back to you tonight i will let you know tomorrow.<br /><br />cheers<br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to talk to you today. Could you get in touch with me ASAP?<br /><br />If you don&#039;t feel like having a phone conversation, can you get back to me today? I really need to know whats going on. Can you do that for me?<br /><br />ASAP, thanks<br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When do you think we will finally be over this mess? What are you deciding? How are we going to come to a resolution? The reason I ask is because I believe the option is still on the table to either refund my money or send me the goods this week. I also ask because I am on a time frame to sign up for the training course. If I miss this training course date then I will have to wait another month.<br /><br />Also you never mentioned in your letters that you would want to continue supplying me with Ice. I don&#039;t know what your intentions are. I feel as though it could be a worthwhile business relatoinship.<br /><br />Or do you want to just refund me my money and call it quits? Your call. But you have to be more verbal and answer these questions. Can you please give me a date as to when you will know about your decision? Are you out of meth and waiting for more? I noticed you took down your meth listing.<br /><br />Holla back ASAP<br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot thank you enough for agreeing to come to a resolution because they are not in the box. I opened the box while sitting on my bed using a fresh razor blade. I did not rip it open so stuff could not fly everywhere. My wife was staring at me while I was opening the box the entire time. I slowly ripped the box apart like you eventually seen in the video. I had taken the video 2 days after I had the box lay beneath my bed.<br /><br />My wife was sleeping when I woke up to get something to eat. I thought about the box beneath the bed, went get it and took another HARD HARD look. NOTHING!!! I had just then responded to your message.<br /><br />The next day I recorded the movie on my phone because my camcorder would not give me the video files off of the camcorder. My wife had the phone so I had to wait until she got home from work.<br /><br />The packages I can assure you were NOT in the BOX when I received it. There is no way I could overlook those packages. I was LOOKING HARD for them.<br /><br />Thank you for finally resolving this with me. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it. Thank you!!!!<br /><br />When can I expect my package then? Could it be this week? Thanks again bro!!!<br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the packages were in the box, sorry for late reply as i get my messages checked but i can only reply to them once im free<br />i don&#039;t know who to believe right now as Ive never had this problem, yes i did pack it my self, did u open the package yourself or did someone else open it for you?<br />you wouldn&#039;t be able to miss it cos its right there in the box where i put it myself<br /><br />if i don&#039;t reply now i will reply once i back in the office this evening, we do really need to resolve this mate asap as i don&#039;t like these situations especially when im in here to build a solid reputation on trust and honesty!!<br /><br /><br />

				_________________________________________________<br />optikai0110<br /><br />--Wednesday 14th August--<br />Finalized early for 14 grams of high grade meth. Very trustworthy vendor. Have had a long time working relationship with him thus far and trust him with this. Everything goes smoothly each time and it should go the same this time around as well. I will definitely update this section upon arrival which will be tomorrow. This is a UK 2 UK order. Postage agreed upon was for overnight express delivery by 9AM with signature required.<br /><br />--UPDATE-- Friday 16th August--<br />Got a response about the package. Should be on it&#039;s way now.<br /><br />--Saturday 17th--<br />Still no change in status.<br /><br />--Monday 19th--<br />Still nothing.<br /><br />--Tuesday 20th--<br />Still nothing. I am sure it was nothing but a mix-up and I should be receiving my package any day now. Changed all of my status back to a 5/5. Should be getting it now. I think we have come to a resolution. <br />_______________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or can I please have a refund of my money. Which ever is good with you. <br />_______________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place yourself in my shoes for just one moment. You can about imagine how pissed I am. I don&#039;t understand why you are doing this to me. Now you are choosing to ignore me instead of making this right.<br /><br />I NEVER RECEIVED THE STUFF - FACT<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t already noticed, I am a vendor just like you. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ac8fe59ccf). I need this order to come through because I have a safety course to go offshore in September. My visa is also due next month. I am straight begging you to help me with this. Please come to some kind of resolution with me. I know none of this has to do with you but I am simply giving you specific reasons why this is so fucking important to me.<br /><br />Yes I get angry because I feel cheated and for some reason or another you don&#039;t seem to give a shit. I wasn&#039;t cheated out of $20, I was cheated out of $1500.<br /><br />I will even take less. I will even take 10 grams, forget the ketamine, forget the half. Look how long we go back. Look at our message history. I am probably one of the most loyal and genuine type of people you would ever meet. I am asking you man to man to please make this right. PLEASE.<br /><br />I am your customer. We came to an agreement between us. I payed you my money. I lived up to my side of the bargain. Please don&#039;t ignore me. I am asking you nicely and from the bottom of my soul to make this right between us. I am just trying to make a little money for a training course (BOSIET) which is expensive.<br /><br />So let&#039;s talk and come a resolution. I know we can. I cannot simply go away. NEITHER CAN YOU. So we must come to a resolution about this mess. Can we now both agree that I didn&#039;t receive my order. BECAUSE I DIDN&#039;T!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Man please I am asking you to make this right between both you and I. Can you please just send me what you owe me (or 10 grams)? Can you please send it by tomorrow. It&#039;s so important that you make it happen. I cannot express to you the importance.<br /><br />PLEASE JUST TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. Tell me did you pack the box or did someone else pack the box. Maybe you forgot to place the packages inside. I am easy to talk to. I am trying to be civil and courteous to you. If someone else packaged the box maybe they forgot to place it inside. A mistake could happen. Mistakes happen. I could understand that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t always have the best reaction especially when being shocked like I am. Look, I know and you know I was angry earlier and said some things, and for that I apologize. I am even offering you the option to purchase a lot more once my order comes in. Who would do that if I were lying. Think about it. We could become truly solid business partners. I have a great reputation and I can move some ICE. That&#039;s all I fuck with. I don&#039;t smoke weed, or anything else. Truth is I am prescribed Dexedrine so I don&#039;t even touch ICE that often anymore.<br /><br />Look I know you probably don&#039;t know what to say about all of this. You made a mistake. SO WHAT!!!! SHIT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. But what&#039;s fair is fair. I know I am rambling on and on but I need to make sure that we are on the same page. Think about it............<br />_______________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://youtu.be/DaQey6pD7Bk<br />______________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wed. morning or I&#039;m raising HELL WATCH IN THIS BITCH<br /><br />WATCH<br /><br /><br /><br />and I don&#039;t smoke hash<br />__________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please understand that I have almost 80 successful transactions under my belt. I don&#039;t play with people nor would I lie about something like this!!!!!!!<br /><br />I did not receive the packages. Please take a long hard look at this and know that I wouldn&#039;t lie to you. This is very important to me that I receive these goods. I don&#039;t care about the 1 gram of ketamine but I need my 14.5 grams which are not here. Think about it. Why would I tell you all of this and not say I was happy with my order which I usually do for everyone else. Just check how much praise I&#039;ve given over my time here. I am going to post a video clip of my going through the remains of this box. <br />__________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am NOT TAKING THE PISS. I swear on both my sons lives that they are not in the box. I will video me going through the box, piece by fucking piece. I am not trying to scam you. I have two witnesses that watched me open the box with nothing in it. I am begging you.<br /><br />Did you pack the box yourself or did a mate pack the box?<br /><br />There is nothing inside the fucking box except broken iPhone parts. NOTHING ELSE and I can prove it. I don&#039;t find this funny nor am I taking the piss my friend. I SWEAR TO GOD ON MY FAMILY&#039;S LIFE THAT THEY ARE NOT IN THE BOX. <br />____________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;please dont take the piss out of me, the silver packages were in the box, vacume packed with a sign saying diamonds on them, mate you cannot miss them, please stop taking the piss out of me, im no MUG!!!<br />_____________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no silver packed packages. I have looked everywhere inside this box. Torn the pieces of phone apart. I have taken the box inch by inch. Where are the silver packages at exactly? I need my stuff. Come on and stop playing.<br /><br />Are they in the phone parts themselves? I have taken that box apart piece by piece. I will show you pictures. Something is wrong with this. THERE ARE NO SILVER PACKAGES INSIDE THIS BOX. I AM LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW. THERE&#039;S NOTHING IN THIS BOX EXCEPT BROKEN IPHONE PARTS. AND I HAVE LOOKED GOOD. NOT ONE SILVER PACKAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />HOLLA BACK<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lol, ofcourse i sent you the phone parts!!!, u know it!!!, did u miss the silver vacume packed packages in there too, 5 of them to be exact.<br />you should be thanking me not asking if i sent you the package!, i put a couple little pots of hash slate in there too as an extra!!<br /><br /><br />enjoy!!!!<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say he got a ticket on some ICE? We don&#039;t play!! Looking for that connect my friend, looking and looking hard.<br /><br /><br /><br />Looking forward to Monday.<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you send me a box of broken iPhone parts? I just received a special delivery sent overnight to the name I use when ordering. It has nothing in it except broken iPhone parts. Did you send it? Just curious.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Looking forward to Monday&#039;s delivery. By the way, how did you send my package? I wish you would of sent it overnight like this one came.<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I apologize for saying what I said. I just tend to over react. I have a family myself (2 boys) so I completely understand where you are coming from. I never meant to cause you any grief I just truly wanted to make contact with you because you seem honest and approachable. I didn&#039;t realize that I was getting on your nerves by sending you messages.<br /><br />I like to keep things simple and straight forward as well mate.<br /><br />My only problem was the cost of the shipping you charged me. I made a total of three orders with you (14g + 1/2g + 1g ketamine). You charged me over $60 for next day shipping when three days had past by. Now I get told that my package will arrive on Monday, hopefully. But you should have made sure that I was getting it tomorrow (Saturday). See my point?? That&#039;s a total of close to a week.<br /><br />Now you are telling me that we cannot do business together in the future. I am asking you to rethink this and truly think it through. Please. I feel like we can make great money together. Especially if you can get me ounces at whatever price you choose. I would much rather deal with someone in the UK. So please please reconsider this choice.<br /><br />I will be needing another ounce in less than a week. So let&#039;s make a deal. <br />_________________________________________________________________________

				optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am far from being a rude human being. I can understand that you have a life outside of SR. BUT GIVE ME AN UPDATE. I asked you more than 10 times if you mailed my stuff. Just a simple Y or N would have kept my mind at ease. Man, I know you are busy.<br /><br />I will give you all the props you deserve and praise you for days on end. But I ain&#039;t no one to play with either.<br /><br />All you had to say was something along the likes: Chill, it&#039;s coming OR go fuck yourself OR 25 lighters to the dresser OR SOMETHING.<br /><br />You just had to explain to me what&#039;s up. But I suppose I get nervous when I have to FE for that amount OK, so there it is. I apologize for seeming to come at you like that but it&#039;s my natural reaction these days. I over react. Specifically I can over react when it comes to my money.<br /><br />Misunderstood<br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your account is about to be suspended. Your stats are dropping faster than a dead fly to horse shit. All for what reason? Huh? Time for a new account, happyman.<br /><br />Here is your section on the forums: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=202851.0<br />______________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only you have the power to stop this. I am going to use every option I can to fuck you over, son. Please give me what I spent with you.<br /><br />I am asking you this last time to please send me my products that you owe me and I will stop reporting you to SR and to the forums.<br /><br />I am begging you to please deliver my products to me or I won&#039;t stop!!!!!<br />_______________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Wednesday 14th August--<br />Finalized early for 14 grams of high grade meth. Very trustworthy vendor. Have had a long time working relationship with him thus far and trust him with this. Everything goes smoothly each time and it should go the same this time around as well. I will definitely update this section upon arrival which will be tomorrow. This is a UK 2 UK order. Postage agreed upon was for overnight express delivery by 9AM with signature required.<br /><br />--UPDATE-- Thursday 15th August--<br />Did not receive my parcel as promised because of some heat around the house. I understand completely. I will update if he makes good on his word. I have dropped my star rating to 1/5 and will raise it back up when I receive my $1500 worth of material.<br /><br />--UPDATE-- Friday 16th August--<br />HE FUCKED ME. DID NOT DELIVER AS PROMISED. He reads my messages but will not respond to any of them. I lost $1500 dealing with happyman. PLEASE STEER CLEAR and FAR AWAY from this THIEF!!!!!!!! I am going to be writing a huge writeup in the forums based on our conversations. I will post a link to this ASAP. I am also reporting him as a SCAMMER to SR. <br />________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU FAILED. WATCH THIS..........<br /><br />I cannot make you give what you owe to me. But I can assure you one thing. This writeup regarding this transaction is going to be all over the forums. I am going to place it it each column. Thank yourself for fucking yourself. Watch my karma raise and yours fall. Enjoy your $1500.<br /><br />Cheerio,<br /><br />Devil Dog<br />_______________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will you read my messages but not respond to me? Just let me know if everything went smoothly yesterday and I should be expecting my package today.<br /><br />I need for you to create another listing for me, please. Would you be comfortable selling me a full ounce this time? TALK TO ME MATE, please......<br /><br />What is going on? Why won&#039;t you at least give me an indication? I am asking you nicely to respond to my question. Did you mail my stuff off yesterday or not? Quite simply, give me as well as yourself the courtesy of not giving yourself a bad name. You are making me quite nervous when you are radio silent.<br /><br />I can potentially make you a lot of money my man. But you are making me quite nervous. Please just answer me!!!!!!<br /><br />I am waiting for the post as I write this message. It usually passes around 9:30 to 10:30. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just please tell me that you were able to mail my stuff off yesterday.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already have another order for you. When my stuff arrives tomorrow, I have another order for you. Kinda drunk right now, Will give you the particulars in the morning. I am spent. Goodnight. Really glad we finally got this order behind us. More coming though. I&#039;ll wire you the money in the morning. This time I need an ounce. Can you do that amount?<br /><br />I cannot wait until the morning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES SIR<br /><br />lata my friend<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you mail my stuff yet?<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought a book called &quot;The Guide to Postal Smuggling&quot;, in PDF. I can send you a copy of the book if you like. Very interesting read. <br />________________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow is Friday. It is very important that I get my stuff by tomorrow. I have a birthday party that my wife and I are attending. Please don&#039;t make me arrive sober. LOL<br /><br />Seriously, have you even mailed it off yet? I really really really must have it by tomorrow, absolutely NEED it by tomorrow. Hail, sleet or snow. Don&#039;t make me worried.<br /><br />So is everything safe around your house now?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I was not implying that you do cut your stuff at all. I was just rambling like I usually do. Dude, those two half gram shards that I received form you the other day, were badass. I mean, clean clean. No body load, straight d-meth mental focus that lasted for hours and hours. I am talking from smoking one bowl, I didn&#039;t need any for at least 6 hours. That&#039;s a damn long time for smoking. I snuffed a line and didn&#039;t want any more for at least 8 hours.<br /><br />Your shit really, truly rocks ma boy!! Best on the SR by far. Blows (MrMerlin25) out of the water and many many others. I hope you keep this connection/cook for a long while.<br /><br />So it&#039;s 1:00PM right now. Please tell me that you have mailed it and I would like a response, if you can, please. <br />_______________________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time are you going to mail it today? Be careful, mate. Just tell me when it&#039;s done being mailed off. When it&#039;s done let me know the tracking number.<br /><br />Growing some bud right next door huh? Better be careful with that.... I take it they were arrested and all. If you can grow 25 plants at full capacity, from start to finish (which only takes 45 days). Your looking at a cool $100,000 tax free in profits. Not too bad but you must consider not to steal peoples electric. LOL. Never grew weed myself.<br /><br />Make sure those shards are mint for me PLEASE!!!!! Otherwise I have to do a acetone rinse, then recrystallize with methanol. I don&#039;t mind purifying the product because I can always tell if there is cut by doing my simple bleach test then seeing how much black residue it creates. I always typically purify a gram for myself. But small batches like this would give me considerable waste, which I cannot have. Not at this amount. I LOVE having the most pure product for my customers. They always know if there is cut and if there is they usually don&#039;t come back. We like our product pure around these parts.<br /><br />I used to cook small (100 g) - medium (500g) sized batches. Make my own Methylamine and all. Haven&#039;t done that in quite a few years. Was quite successful until I got tired of that particular game.<br /><br />I know some people have been selling meth recrystallized with MSM. Adds weight but tastes almighty different and doesn&#039;t crack back and has that awful taste. The formation of pinwheels within the crystalline restructuring itself after heating and cooling down does not do the same thing is MSM is present.<br /><br />The tweakers know.<br /><br />I once had a friend come around with 4-5 ounces of class-A totally uncut meth. He started cutting it so he could double his profits. We got into a huge debate over whether or not he should cut it. He said it was too strong for people. I said that&#039;s the point. People can decide the strength. <br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really sorry about today, electricity in my building went down which left me completely stuck, later found out some chinese guys downstairs where growing weed with stolen electric, police was all over the place and i didnt dare go out there past them<br /><br />il be posting it this morning mate, and il throw in a few extras to make you happy.<br /><br />really sorry and i do appreciate your help

				___________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, I do have the utmost trust in you but it&#039;s just not like for you to completely radio silent. If you said you mailed it. Your word is your bond. Looking forward to tomorrow then. I&#039;ll finish that positive write up for you in the forums. I didn&#039;t have to do this for you but this will help you tremendously. I hope you come to appreciate it.<br /><br /><br />PS a tracking number would be worthless since it was sent overnight. Take care, I am off for the night. The mail passes early here. Thanks for everything.<br />___________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you at least confirm that this was sent out. I get nervous as you can understand. The last thing you told me was that I would get a tracking number soon thereafter but have been waiting for one.<br /><br />I need you to talk to me man, tell me what&#039;s up. Is there anything wrong?<br />________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send me my tracking number ASAP. Also, please confirm that this is on the way, I know you are busy but just let me know, please. I am worried about it not getting here in the morning. Just a simple yes or no. I am particularly interested in finding out how the process went.<br /><br />When I get my goods tomorrow, I will help you out be writing a lengthy review in the vendor&#039;s forum about our overall transaction. I have a degree in Journalism so I could make your name truly shine in the forums to help you drum up more business.<br /><br />If the quality is there then people need to hear about this and I will do what it takes to make sure that you get the recognition you deserve. In fact I already began creating a forum entry detailing the outlines of our transaction.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me some good news, I am excited about tomorrows delivery. I know I sure as hell bother you a lot but that&#039;s just me. Can I have my tracking number please? Were you able to get it delivered before 9am including signature?<br /><br />Mate I cannot tell you how excited I am to finally have found someone as reliable as yourself. For sure, I will have another 14 gram order from you next week. Starting rather small like this was probably wise on both our sides.<br /><br />Do you know I have a very strict policy against FE. I almost cancelled the order because I NEVER EVER FINALIZE. But something told me that you could be trusted and I decided to go with you because I know from our past dealings, you always delivered. <br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payed for. Yes include it in the meth package. Thanks<br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I placed an order for the ketamine (1 gram). Can I just finalize the ketamine once it arrives and have it placed in the same order as the meth? Otherwise, mark it &quot;in transit&quot; and I will finalize with you now and you can include it in the same package as the meth. What time are you going to be posting my package? Thanks.<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, please confirm when you have shipped my product. Just gives me piece of mind.<br /><br />Oh and I have another order for you for a gram of ketamine. Could you squeeze this is in this particular order or would this have to go into another order?<br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;ve finalized both orders by the way for a total of close to $1500 including the half g and express shipping options. Please tell me and let me know when you have shipped my order.<br /><br />I had another question for you. Is it possible to keep ordering 14 gram amounts from you say every week or week and a half. Would you be able to deliver those quantities and that consistent quality each and every time? The reason I ask is because I am looking for a reliable source and I would like to make you my go to guy for this. I am looking for a trusting person, which I think you are just the person who I have been looking for. All I ask is that you communicate with me regularly. I may ask for communication that may seem to be frivolous and unnecessary but this communication is all we have with one another and is extremely vital. If you get back to me like you have been doing, then that&#039;s all I can ask for.<br /><br />Let me know if you can deliver 14 grams every week or week and a half. I might need more than 14 grams, if you can handle that.<br /><br />So could I get you to give me a price on an ounce. Get all that info together for me and I will greatly appreciate it.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finalized and done. Your turn to deliver some of those high grade shards. Are you going to get a tracking number for me and could you get it sent priority overnight by 9am, signature required. Thanks bro. Now awaiting tomorrows delivery. <br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive accepted the order and its in transit now, please let me know once you have done it, the post office is in front of my house il run over and send it as soon as.<br /><br />cheers<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for me to finalize you are going to have to mark the package &quot;In Transit&quot; on your side. I cannot finalize right now because I don&#039;t have the option on the 14 grams order.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes il add the half gram to your 14gram order, il give you a total of 14.5 grams, please FE asap so i can post it out to you.<br />sorry about the trouble you had with the vendor and its unfortunate that he placed you on the blacklist, im sure we will have a good business relationship, u seem a genuine guy.<br /><br />please FE, i can post it out next day delivery for you, it will reach to you by tomorrow<br /><br />many thanks<br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a separate issue altogether. This is pertaining to my order for a half gram I ordered last Thursday. Can you please give me an update? Are you requiring FE for that as well?<br /><br />It was supposed to be here by yesterday but didn&#039;t make it. I know you already know this but I paid $20 for first class shipping but it has not showed up yet. You mentioned that you were moving to a new location, do you think that due to the move you might of forgot to mail it? Just wondering because I am flat out. Thanks for your help in locating it. <br />_________________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check it out. I don&#039;t mind FE but I HAVE TO HAVE IT BY TOMORROW. Can you assure me that you can do this for me? I would greatly appreciate it!!<br /><br />I know exactly how I was placed on a blacklist to begin with.<br /><br />Bro, check out my stats, look at how long I have been a member. Look at how many times I have ordered from you without fail. This should be your guide not some &quot;blacklist&quot;. Please take a look at my statistics.<br /><br />The only thing that has ever happened between a vendor and myself was that I got a package (7 grams) confiscated from (MarijuanaIsMyMuse) out of Canada. I received a letter from the DEA telling me that they had my package and all that jazz. I even scanned in the letter using an anonymous imaging service for him to see. He almost refused after all that evidence to pay me what he owed me according to his refund policies. He eventually made good with me and paid me what he owed me. But that is the only time I ever had a problem with a vendor. Does it show who put me on a blacklist? I would like to know because I am especially good to those who I purchase from because I place myself in their shoes.<br /><br />My apologies, sir for being freaked out it&#039;s just I cannot believe my name would ever be placed on a &quot;blacklist&quot;. If you choose to take a look at my stats, which I am sure you already have, it will show only that one time with (MarijuanaIsMyMuse) I got refunded so it equals a 1% refund rate. That&#039;s it!!! I have spent over $7000 throughout my time here which may not be a lot to some but that&#039;s as much as a nice used BMW for goodness sakes.<br /><br />This is the only reason I have been placed on a blacklist. <br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi, before we post anything out we do a check on the vendors forum where there is a blacklist, we found your user name on this blacklist, for this reason we would require you to FE before we can post it out to you.<br /><br />its all ready and packaged<br /><br />sorry for any inconvenience and i hope you understand<br /><br />cheers<br />IF YOU NOT HAPPY WITH FE THEN LET ME KNOW AND I WILL CANCEL YOUR ORDER<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you able to get it sent off, in time, for a tomorrows delivery? I noticed that it is still in processing.<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes its the same as last time mate<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think we need a tracking number to go along with the overnight delivery? What do you think? Let me know. <br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done. All wrapped up my friend. Awaiting tomorrow&#039;s shipment. Will finalize as soon as I receive the parcel. Thanks again for your time with this one. <br />___________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldn&#039;t be much longer. I am watching it on block-chain take it&#039;s merry time. Also, I wanted to ask you if this is the same shards that I received last week, because those were dynamite my friend. <br />____________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi mate let me know when you going to order so i can have it ready for you for tomorrow, im waiting for your order so i can go post office and send it out to you,<br /><br />cheers<br />____________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to send the order to you within the hour. Just moving the bitcoins from one place to another. Keep a look out for it. Thanks mate. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mate, we need to get the price correct firstly. You first gave me a quote of $1200. Then $1225, now $1250. But on the link you are charging me $1452. I have the $1250 right now. Can we just go with that, the highest quote you gave me?<br /><br />And I still have not received my half gram package yet from last Thursday.<br /><br />Please get back to me ASAP because I want to place the order today and receive it tomorrow. Thanks.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br />happyman 4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ok, $1250, i will send special delivery super stealth!!, opoligies for the slow response lately its just we have been moving to a new location and its been hectic as hell.<br />but we are settled and ready to get back to work asap!, when did u want to order???<br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to order from you to start 14 grams. I would like it delivered overnight. Could we say $1200 for the 14 grams? I will need for you to create a stealth listing for me. <br />______________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why shipping takes so long with you now. I mean at $20, I am being charged already, whilst still in the UK. This should call for super fast shipping times. At $20 for shipping, I should at least get it overnight!! It was never like ths before with you. You used to be faster with your shipping and responses to messages. I am not trying to be rude at all but today is Thursday. If the same thing happens like last weeks order, then I won&#039;t get my stuff until Monday or Tuesday. This is really unfair. I understand that management has changed but the overall process has gotten slower by all standards. All I am saying is that $20 for shipping is already steep and yet my order comes days later??? Put yourself into my shoes.<br /><br />My order went in at 11:00am and is still in processing. Has this even been shipped?<br /><br />Thanks for understanding and I hope you take this as constructive criticism. <br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paid almost $20 for shipping and it still didn&#039;t arrive today. Should I be worried or just be patient? Thank you and sorry to disturb you on your sons birthday.<br /><br />Thanks<br />___________________________________________________________________________<br />optikai0110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for letting me know but it still did not make it here today. Do you think it will arrive tomorrow?<br />___________________________________________________________________________
