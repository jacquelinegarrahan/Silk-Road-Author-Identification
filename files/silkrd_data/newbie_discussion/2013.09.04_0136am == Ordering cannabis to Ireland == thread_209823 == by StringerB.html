				I want to buy 1-2 one oz packages per week from the uk (as unfortunately there are no current vendors in ireland) and i am just wondering how a one oz package would be treated if it was picked up by customs. Would it be considered personal and get a letter, or would i be looking at a controlled delivery? There will be nothing illegal at the delivery address so if there is a controlled delivery could I still be charged for importing the ounce?

				Have to bump this sorry I need answers before I buy abroad. A good domestic dealer would be great if any potential Irish vendors happen to read this.

				I looked for vendors from Ireland a few weeks ago there was one but he/she was extremely expensive compared to UK vendors. I therefore am now more looking more of good stealth reviews MBB packaged instead of if it&#039;s from UK or Ireland personally. They could be from your region but if they&#039;re packing poorly then it wouldn&#039;t make much difference? I believe was vac seal they were using not mbb.<br /><br />Try read reviews on their vendor page.<br /><br />From what i&#039;ve seen people order from nederlands etc and receive their orders.

				I&#039;ve seen people say on these forums that the netherlands is a &#039;flagged country&#039; so mail is more likely to be searched if it&#039;s from there. MrCronk seems to have great stealth packaging but i&#039;m not sure if i&#039;m comfortable with finalizing early. If only we had the same standard of vendors in Ireland as in Canada or the US
