			<dd class="postbody">
				Several weeks ago some friends and I started some cocaine testing on various vendors on Silk Road. Along with an accurate purity test, we give reviews on customer service as well. We have tested four vendors so far and we have another package on the way. As we don&#039;t have an unlimited supply of money, we are trying hard to keep the reviews at a good pace for now. We are fairly new so the newbie section will have to do for now but soon we will move to better discussions.<br /><br />Our tests are accurate and are always anonymous! No vendor will ever be aware that their product or service is being tested and we will stay true to this, unlike PineappleLove. No disrespect to him, but I feel like vendors will go to extra lengths to give him the best product when he orders without anonymity or makes agreements. We just feel like the best approach is anonymity and we will always believe in this. Purity ratings are out of 100 and service ratings are out of 5.<br />The four vendors that have been tested are:<br /><br />(Purity/Service)<br /><br />07/1/13 Lloydsbrothers: 80%/5<br />06/1/13 10toes: 61%/5<br />06/21/13 Chaletla: 71%/4<br />07/13/13 steadyeddy: 57%/5<br /><br />*Please note: Purity is subject to change over the course of weeks or months as vendors do not always get the same quality product! This thread will be edited as time progresses and more threads will be created on here and Reddit UNDER THE SAME SCREEN NAME. We take pride in who we are and what we do.<br /><br />We are just a few guys who are trying to help Silk Road buyers and sellers with a few tests here and there. We do look to speed up our testing and possibly move onto other things as well (MDMA, Ketamine, Speed, etc.) But for now it will just be what we can get.<br /><br />If we do not have a review after a few weeks, do not worry, be patient! And as everyone knows, Silk Road is not necessarily a cheap place, especially for cocaine. So we are trying our best and we will accept donations! Since we do not make agreements with vendors, we do not receive free products. Donations will not necessarily be needed but will be extremely helpful if you all would like to see reviews more often than what has been the case.<br /><br />BTC Address for donations:<br /><br />1FhjXN2vqXNxNcvw44p9TDN55aGngfa5Ma<br /><br />***The address provided is NOT an account that makes purchases. BTC will be tumbled several times before making purchases! We are not out to just get bitcoin. Reviews WILL continue without donations, but they will just be slower. Donations are just something that would be very helpful and would speed up the review process. You can also reach us at alldayandnight@tormail.org. Thank you all for reading.

				Very interesting and nice idea...<br /><br />I&#039;m quite curious about how your results will compare to those of PineappleLove...<br /><br />Do keep the anonymity at all times! Never post any comment on the forum with the useraccount you&#039;ve created anywhere else but on the pages that you started for the testing. <br />Never buy or send PM to vendors with this account on SR. <br /><br />Stay ANONYMOUS all the way. Be paranoid about it. <br /><br />And get the results of your tests out here so that we can compare them to PL&#039;s and/or learn from it. <br /><br />It&#039;s a very nice way to help out this community!

				We would rather not disclose all of our testing methods but I can tell you that we are very knowledgeable on the subject. One of the main ways we test is by using hot plates. Pure cocaine begins melting right around 195 degrees celsius so a lower melting point will indicate that there are impurities in the coke. This isn&#039;t the only way we test or the best way but it just gives you a little insight on what we do.<br /><br />Cuts can normally consist of: <br /><br />Quinine<br />Lidocaine<br />Procaine<br />Lactose<br />Caffeine<br /><br />and many other common ones.<br /><br />Most cuts with cocaine will have melting points far below cocaine but some others (lactose, caffeine) will have melting points above cocaine so they will be left over far after the coke has melted. <br /><br />***THIS IS NOT OUR ONLY WAY OF TESTING. IT IS ACCURATE BUT SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS THE ONLY INDICATOR OF PURITY***<br />

				I will elaborate and say that we use numerous types of simple tests and more complex ones. It should be noted that we do NOT use equipment that is worth tens of thousands of dollars. We do not claim to be world class chemists who use the best equipment and tests, but the equipment and tests we use are rather expensive. From research and experience, we have gone to lengths to not use any tests or chemicals that would provide a false positive or ones that are unreliable. We use tests that identify certain things and we also use tests that take purity into account.

				And don&#039;t get me wrong, your hesitation is good. Most people have no way of knowing the purity of their drugs at all. We do not claim to be able to get it perfect down the tenth of a number. But we do know we are extremely close.

				I can&#039;t confirm all of these as I have never tested any myself (only done coke like once anyway) but my bud told me he got some chaletla ice and coke about a month ago. He didnt test the ice but he said the coke was probably about two thirds pure. figured this from a few ez tests and other ones but I&#039;m not sure of their names. so i&#039;m not sure if that has any indications for this guys credibility and i&#039;m a little hesitant too but alldayandnight listed chaletla right around what my bud thought his were at so i feel a little better about this guys tests

				That&#039;s good to hear that the results are similar. And also, if you have anyone else not listed in the poll that you would want us to test, feel free to comment and let us know. We can&#039;t guarantee that we will be able to but we can always try!

Their coke, is soooo nice no horrible side affects like impotency,<br />paranoia, just a nice feeling.&nbsp; Op are them kits dear to buy, we should all have a fund where we can supply these guys with some BTC towards these kits as they are doing the community a massive service here.+1 for you sir.

				I&#039;d like everyone to know that we do agree with Candy and more people on&nbsp; the forums should analyze posts like this. These tests SHOULD be taken with a grain of salt. I will say again, we do NOT claim to be world class chemists but we do have access to quality equipment. We do not use EZTest. We do not use cheap hot plates either. They are of a very high quality but once again, they are not our only method of testing. We have numerous other methods. These results will NOT be spot on every single time down to the tenth of a number. However, we guarantee that they will indeed be very close. We are looking to gain access to better equipment soon but be patient. And also, we would like to reiterate that vendors&#039; quality changes from time to time. ***Just because a vendor has poor/high quality from one batch, that does NOT mean they will always have the same quality product. It is always subject to change. Whether it be a small change or a large change, anything is possible.***

				Hey! Out of your poll, I&#039;d vote for godofall, but are you going to test his unwashed, acetone washed, and ethyl washed varieties? If not, I THINK his acetone washed is the most popular, but you should probably just ask him.<br /><br />Some other ones that interest me are Licentia, and blueberry91. Blueberry91 seems to have people vouching for him in the forums and has good feedback, but doesn&#039;t use PGP, so I&#039;ve been a bit iffy with him. I&#039;ve messaged him a bit though, and nothing was immediately off-putting about him... well, besides that he uses privnote, but that&#039;s not really a character flaw, it&#039;s a methodology flaw, which is what&#039;s important and why I personally haven&#039;t ordered from him.<br /><br />Anyway, here&#039;s a link to PineappleLove&#039;s Stimulant analysis webpage, but all of the data is a few months old, so things may well have changed. <br />http://braqrsskizlusigz.onion/<br /><br />But good luck with everything you&#039;re doing! The more purity testers there are, the better, and with enough donations maybe equipment can be upgraded, environment can be updated, noise can be reduced, etc., so keep working toward that!<br /><br />Edit: Clarification

It should be noted that we do NOT use equipment that is worth tens of thousands of dollars. We do not claim to be world class chemists who use the best equipment and tests, but the equipment and tests we use are rather expensive. From research and experience, we have gone to lengths to not use any tests or chemicals that would provide a false positive or ones that are unreliable. We use tests that identify certain things and we also use tests that take purity into account.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the slight elaboration.<br /><br />I hope that none of the tests you are referring to are ez-test?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, they can be used to give indications on which type of drug you have, but i think that the general consensus is that they are very unreliable in determining purity level, and quite often give out false positives.<br /><br />Aside from the melting test (Which, again, i only think is valid with high grade equipment, and not with a home-depot hotplate and an infra-red thermometer), I would probably try to determine purity by performing various cleaning procedures, (washing with acetone, ipa, ether, chlorophyll, etc), and perhaps perform an A/B extraction, but personally i would not post the results of such procedures to the forums, as the margin of error would increase tremendously with each step in the process.<br /><br />Again i think it is commendable that you want to help out the community, but i also think that your results should be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The thing about doing tests as these, (with no way of verifying whether or not you and your methods are professional enough to be trustworthy), and disclosing the results as being accurate, is that bad reviews can essentially make or break some vendors (especially new ones), and i just don&#039;t think that is fair.<br />Of course the knowledgeable users here are probably wise enough to draw their own conclusions, but seing as this thread is located at the newbie section, i am afraid that a lot of newbies are just a little to gullible, and easy manipulated, so if they blindly believe these results, it could be hurting the vendors future costumer base.<br /><br />I will get of your back now, and see what the future will bring. At the moment i have not yet tried any of the vendors you have tested, so i have no idea of the legitimacy of the provided results, but i will be watching the development, and if you should happen to do a test on one of my vendors, i will probably chime in with my experiences and perhaps a comparison between your results and my own (I test most of the product i receive, but again, i keep the results to myself as i don&#039;t consider my tests accurate).<br /><br />On a side note, I always do my best to get the highest purity possible, but this is mostly to avoid the nasty cuts. I would rather buy&nbsp; a product that consist of 60% coke, and 40% caffeine, than a product with 87% coke, and 10% levamisole, or phenacetine.<br /><br />Actually even though i think the purity is very important, i think it is far more important to know what the impurities consist of.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 to you for this, it&#039;s spot on<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>And what makes you qualified to ask such erudite questions, you have a degree in Chemistry or maybe an MSc Toxicology?

				First, thanks for stepping up and providing this great service to all the SR coke aficionados. Although highly sought after, uncut blow seems to be one of the more difficult things to find. This should help.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping you&#039;ll be able to provide some information on cuts. Like others, I&#039;d prefer to buy something that was 60% cocaine with no active cuts, than 80% cocaine with Levamisole. Are you testing for that?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen posts criticizing EZTest recently. They have two: &#039;EZtest for cocaine purity&#039; and &#039;EZTest for cocaine cuts&#039;.&nbsp; While the Purity test may not be the best way to gauge overall cocaine levels, the &#039;cocaine cuts&#039; seems useful. I&#039;m not aware of another simple test for Levamisole.<br /><br />

This isn&#039;t the only way we test or the best way but it just gives you a little insight on what we do.<br /><br />Cuts can normally consist of: <br /><br />Quinine<br />Lidocaine<br />Procaine<br />Lactose<br />Caffeine<br /><br />and many other common ones.<br /><br />Most cuts with cocaine will have melting points far below cocaine but some others (lactose, caffeine) will have melting points above cocaine so they will be left over far after the coke has melted. <br /><br />***THIS IS NOT OUR ONLY WAY OF TESTING.

				So what kinds of tests would you recommend? I live in this US so it would be hard to buy anything.

				A basic test for what it is cut with is just an EZTest cocaine cuts test. Cheap, easy to use, pretty effective/accurate and it won&#039;t have the feds knocking on your door. Let it be known this shouldn&#039;t be the only test to use either. More tests=more accuracy

Along with an accurate purity test, we give reviews on customer service as well. We have tested four vendors so far and we have another package on the way. As we don&#039;t have an unlimited supply of money, we are trying hard to keep the reviews at a good pace for now. We are fairly new so the newbie section will have to do for now but soon we will move to better discussions.<br /><br />Our tests are accurate and are always anonymous! No vendor will ever be aware that their product or service is being tested and we will stay true to this, unlike PineappleLove. No disrespect to him, but I feel like vendors will go to extra lengths to give him the best product when he orders without anonymity or makes agreements. We just feel like the best approach is anonymity and we will always believe in this. Purity ratings are out of 100 and service ratings are out of 5.<br />The four vendors that have been tested are:<br /><br />(Purity/Service)<br /><br />07/1/13 Lloydsbrothers: 80%/5<br />06/1/13 10toes: 61%/5<br />06/21/13 Chaletla: 71%/4<br />07/13/13 steadyeddy: 57%/5<br /><br />*Please note: Purity is subject to change over the course of weeks or months as vendors do not always get the same quality product! This thread will be edited as time progresses and more threads will be created on here and Reddit UNDER THE SAME SCREEN NAME. We take pride in who we are and what we do.<br /><br />We are just a few guys who are trying to help Silk Road buyers and sellers with a few tests here and there. We do look to speed up our testing and possibly move onto other things as well (MDMA, Ketamine, Speed, etc.) But for now it will just be what we can get.<br /><br />If we do not have a review after a few weeks, do not worry, be patient! And as everyone knows, Silk Road is not necessarily a cheap place, especially for cocaine. So we are trying our best and we will accept donations! Since we do not make agreements with vendors, we do not receive free products. Donations will not necessarily be needed but will be extremely helpful if you all would like to see reviews more often than what has been the case.<br /><br />BTC Address for donations:<br /><br />1FhjXN2vqXNxNcvw44p9TDN55aGngfa5Ma<br /><br />***The address provided is NOT an account that makes purchases. BTC will be tumbled several times before making purchases! We are not out to just get bitcoin. Reviews WILL continue without donations, but they will just be slower. Donations are just something that would be very helpful and would speed up the review process. You can also reach us at alldayandnight@tormail.org.

				Fantastic work! I&#039;ll be making a donation when I get my coins and SR is back up, I am definitely interested in the cuts though. <br /><br />To me that is the main thing. I don&#039;t sniff coke that often so when I do I want something nice and I don&#039;t mind paying for it but the &quot;active cuts&quot; are what bother me with coke. If it&#039;s 70% with no active cuts I&#039;d take that over 80% but with 10% lidocaine. I don&#039;t like putting foreign speedy chemicals that give you a nasty anxiety come down so if it&#039;s lactose then again I would be ok with that but not benzocaine or anything like that. I can&#039;t be bothered to do an acetone wash in a coffee filter I&#039;d probably get it wrong and lose too much product or it would take too long to dry or something, I had a bad experience with an acetone wash making DMT once but that&#039;s another story!

				Good thread.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I&#039;ve done an EZ test on the Sukey Ultra Clean Coke (UCC)<br /><br />Results are good, no active cuts, purity as high as you see with an EZ test.<br /><br />Photos to be published on the Sukey review thread.<br /><br />Cheers.
