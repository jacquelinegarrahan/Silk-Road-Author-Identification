				I am about to buy some coins for the first time on mon. I was going to use BitInstant because there are alot of good reviews and it is in most of the newbie guides as to being pretty easy to do. But the last few days I have been seeing numerous threads pop up that they are stealing $ and stuff. Is there a better option out there? I&#039;ve heard OK things about bitfloor.

				Bitfloor is a much better option than Bitinstant. Bitinstant has been going downhill for a while now and is terribly unreliable at the moment.

				Bitfloor is good, however I am not impressed with their server&#039;s capacity to handle a lot of trades. If you are not actually day trading or hoarding bitcoins then I would definitely give them a try, you can buy as much as you want at once. The other day I used it and I only paid $25 for a $1500 deposit. It was in the account within 30 minutes too. I&#039;ve used bitinstant a lot but I don&#039;t like bitinstant&#039;s 500 limit and fees associated with it. Plus I&#039;ve had problems with their API twice now and have had to contact their support to get my funds released. Their support is good but I much prefer bitfloor now.

				Ive used bit instant numerous times in the past two weeks. I&#039;ve had any issues with them. It is a bitch having to make mulitple deposits especially when you&#039;re depositing $6000 ;)<br /><br />However, I noticed that I couldn&#039;t use the same phone number twice in one day when you fill out the money gram order. THAT WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS! I had to drive to multiple locations and use different identitys with different phone numbers :/

				I will vouch for bit floor as well. If I didn&#039;t want too many people lagging the servers I would say everyone should use it. My used always goes to my bitfloor account the instant the bank teller sends it. It takes seconds to trade for bit coins and normally 15 maybe 30 minutes.<br /><br />I did have a question about it though. I was.wondering if you had a bank of America account whether or not you could use the boa app and bill pay it to them. I have had multiple tellers suggest it to me but I don&#039;t think you could because it says that you must send local till a cash deposit. And I&#039;m guessing you would lose a tiny bit of the security when it comes to purchasing the bit coins. Although I do only enjoy the security of the transaction as a precaution because buying btc is completely legal.
