				this vendor shorted my order two weeks ago...i paid him and left him good feedback anyways, as he had many reviews stating he is a great vendor and stands up for his mistakes.......so I messaged him and let him know my bag that was supposed to be 3/4 gram only weighed 0.7 gram with the bag....the bag weighs 0.22<br />he took a week to respond and only offered free shipping....so i replied and explained myself better so he understood I weighed with the bag and I was quite a bit short on my order......he did not respond for 2 days , so I changed my feedback and he finally responded as he was worried about his rep......then he sent me a message saying he did not understand that i weighed with the bag and so I explained that it was stuck to the bag from mailing and that is what I meant and i apologized for any misunderstanding and even changed his feedback ....so he messages me back and offers a credit for part of the product he shorted me or a refund (still partial)with the exception that if i took a refund I would be cut off from ordering from him.....so I messaged back and explained that I do not wish for a refund and that I only want what I was shorted and he said he did not want to risk shipping another package....ISNT THAT WHAT VENDORS DO???? SHIP DRUGS???TAKE RISKS&gt;....you dont think its a risk for me to receive a package?? and should I not have gotten the full amount the first time......he has now not responded to my messages for 3 days and it has been over 2 weeks since I ordered and still no resolution to this.......so i changed his feedback back to a 2 which may be too nice, but he did ship fast and the product is fire....and I really want to give the guy a chance.....but its not looking good right now

				If he was underweight then he should make it up.it was obviously a half gram he sent you not 3/4.Have you taken it up with SR seeing as you are not getting anywhere with him?<br />I wouldnt set up a post saying&quot;dont buy from nod4less&quot; because he hasn&#039;t ripped you,just made a mistake and sounds to me like there might be a language barrier when pm-ing each other.

				I have given him over 2 weeks to fix this, and he is now completely ignoring my messages, so there is no language barrier....he just does not want to send me what is owed....I already paid for this order 2 weeks ago, so there is no fixing this through silkroad......the only thing I can do is protect others and this is why I have started this thread in the newbie section...if he makes it right, I will let everyone know and I will change my feedback....but honestly I think he ripped me off on purpose at this point<br />why would he simply refuse to send me what he shorted me, saying its too much risk to send another package when that is what vendors do here??&nbsp; I gave him plenty of chances to make this right and still I wait for his reply after 3 days of no communication at all so I am warning others not to buy from this vendor and this is with good reason.....do you think it is a bad thing to be honest about a problem with a vendor and keep others from getting ripped off ??&nbsp; I dont want to be the bad guy here and I dont want people to think I am trashing a vendor.....
