				Hi all,<br />Just a heads up for anyone who wasn&#039;t aware, Infinite Source scammed&nbsp; a heap of buyers, particularly Aussies. I&#039;m still relatively new, although these are my purchase stats.<br /><br />Total transactions: 13<br />Total spent: $6677.49<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />Had never FE&#039;d for anyone, but after about 30 PM&#039;s back and forth, gave this guy the benefit of the doubt -BIG FUCKING MISTAKE- anyhow, after going through the rumor mill meth vendors thread, I found out a whole heap more that I should have been intelligent enough to investigate BEFORE I FE&#039;d.<br /><br />I have PM ed him on Atlantis , as he claimed he would return BTC &#039;LESS VENDOR ACCOUNT COSTS&#039;, However, I won&#039;t hold my breath.<br />If anyone is checking out Atlantis - PROTECT YOURSELF- DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SCAMMING ASSHOLE!!!!<br /><br />Any genuine vendors E.G - Kush, Hammertime, Have NEVER EVER asked me to FE, even when I had less than 3 Purchases. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra coin, and go with these trusted pro&#039;s,- at both stealth, and quality!<br /><br />NEVER FE to ANYONE <br /><br />

				Will post on Atlantis, just that most people headed there are from SR, or so it seems.<br />&nbsp;<br />Not sure of exact Atlantis url, was at a friend&#039;s place when I saw it, will suss it out and get back to you. Wouldn&#039;t waste my time though, seems to be SR vendors mainly the ones with bad reps on SR, afew legit SR vendors, though I think I&#039;m just gonna stick with the road, what, and who I know.<br /><br />I never had a problem until I took the bait from I S, but that&#039;s my own fault, should never have FE&#039;d to the asshole. SOmetimes it&#039;s easy to get scammed by some asshole pretending to be genuine, particularly after you&#039;ve pm&#039;ed back and forth for a little bit. Then again, if you never took the chance , you&#039;d never get any decent , suitably priced gear and we&#039;d all still be at the mercy of some wanker, street level dealer, who&#039;ll probably just rip you off anyway
