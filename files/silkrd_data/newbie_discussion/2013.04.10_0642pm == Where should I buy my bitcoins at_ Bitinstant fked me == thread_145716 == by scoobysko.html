				Well I lost 750$ to bitinstant yesterday.. unless they eventually plan on<br />sending my money to me, but they haven&#039;t responded to anything.<br /><br />Where should I buy bitcoins at right now? I want to be able to take my cash<br />to a bank or somewhere to deposit money and have the bitcoins fast. Any suggestions?<br />I checked out the blueskytrade and they&#039;re sold out, so was a bitcopia or something else<br />I checked out.

				I am having a similar problem, I made a deposit early monday morning to bitinstant through blockchain, and can&#039;t get support to email me back after 2 days.&nbsp; I made my deposit through moneygram though, so I can get it back.

				There are several threads on this right now guys and i went through the same situation using bitinstant and zip zap to send funds to an exchange. Bitinstant is really fucked up now and as i understand Bank of America is the cheapest way to go but i am unclear on the process. At any rate go to this link on bitinstant help forum and ask USRAY (a bitinstant rep) to open a ticket for you and escalte it for you as you have already waited too long. Include your order ID from your bitinstant transaction or whatever info you have. If it is a MTGOX code do not post that in the forum or you could get robbed. PM it to a bitinstant rep like USRAY. Here is the link and good luck. It took me 4 days to get my money but there are alot more people suffering on this now.<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.4400

				I used bitinstant 3 days ago to purchase over $300 worth of bitcoins and they were in my blockchain within an hour of sending the moneygram. I&#039;ve always sent mine directly to my wallet rather than getting a coupon for an exchange and it&#039;s went through flawlessly everytime. Not saying you didn&#039;t get beat for your money I&#039;m just saying I have never had any problems.
