				Well, since this is a &quot;What If&quot; scenario..<br /><br />Might as well go for the gold medal and just use Rohypnol instead of Viagra, most people take MDMA before going into a club (from my experience anyway). That would be pretty hilarious in all honesty.

				Eh.&nbsp; I&#039;m against this type of thought.. even if it is only &quot;hypothetical&quot;.<br /><br />There was a guy around town here, not too long ago, selling capsules of &quot;molly&quot; that had no effect at all.&nbsp; He was dead two days after I heard of the scam.&nbsp; There was another guy who was selling &quot;lsd&quot; which were bunk hits.. he has been discredited and as far as I know he&#039;s all alone these days.<br /><br />Bad idea.. never do this.&nbsp; Why even bother to think of it?&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculous, unhelpful, and possibly harmful.&nbsp; The game is fucked up enough these days; people like this are making the name worse and making it harder for people to obtain what they want.

You never know what they put in that shit. I had a friend who&#039;s dealer tried to pass on catnip as weed, and not to like a bunch of naive high school kids but to people you wouldn&#039;t regularly deal to. Rest assured he won&#039;t be walking anytime soon, or ever in fact. That&#039;s why you should only buy online from trusted vendors or from someone you know who won&#039;t try to pass on catnip to you off as weed. It&#039;s fun to joke around, but like I previously said there are people retarded enough to actually do it. Most people here know better, and know when someone is joking or not.

				there is definitely a special place in hell for all those grimy dealers. Selling you short, cutting things, selling dangerous stuff, sell things under false pretenses. etc. they should all have shit carved into their foreheads so we can easily recognize them.

				I did this to my little brother once.<br /><br />Although, I never sold it to him. Just crushed up the pill, and told him I had just crushed a new kinda&#039; triforce (because he loved those) and he swept all the powder in to a glass and drank it. <br /><br />Two hours later when he was moaning about the pill being dud, I told him. He was like.. &quot;What the fuck, man!!! I was wondering why I&#039;ve had a hard on the for the last 45 minutes!!&quot;<br /><br />Was a good laugh for me and my mates, not for him so much.
