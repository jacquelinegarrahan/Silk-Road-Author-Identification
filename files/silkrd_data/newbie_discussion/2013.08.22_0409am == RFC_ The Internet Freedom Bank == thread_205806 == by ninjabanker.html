				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA512<br /><br />The Internet Freedom Bank (IFB) is a proposed distributed,<br />censorship-resistant bank that can fill the vacuum left by Liberty<br />Reserve in terms of permitting the type of private, neutral, and<br />unobstructed electronic fiat transfers that the legacy banking system is<br />legally unable to provide. The purpose of the bank is to provide<br />cryptocurrency exchanges with fiat liquidity until such time as no more<br />demand for fiat currencies exists.<br /><br />The organization itself is run by a network of volunteers who can elect<br />to operate under their legal names or pseudonymously. Organizational<br />roles are generally horizontal, except for a group of trustees. The<br />trustees should be 7-9 individuals, not more than half of whom can be<br />anonymous, who must live in different legal jurisdictions. The only role<br />of the trustees is to hold the private keys necessary for the bank to<br />distribute its BTC assets, an operation which should be infrequent. The<br />private keys will be split such that (n/2+1) trustees must agree to<br />approve any outgoing transaction.<br /><br />Unlike most banks, the IFB will not hold reserves in a central location.<br />Instead, individual members all over the world are responsible for<br />holding deposits and redeeming bank-issued electronic notes. Customers<br />who want to make a deposit to the bank must find a member near them<br />willing to accept fiat. When a customer deposits fiat with a member,<br />their account is credited with the appropriate balance. Withdrawals work<br />in a similar fashion. A customer who wants to withdraw fiat must find a<br />member willing to redeem their balance.<br /><br />This basic structure will allow the bank to offer account denominated in<br />any currency or commodity, as long as members exist who are willing to<br />hold that currency or commodity in reserve and remain available for<br />redemptions. For the rest this discussion will refer to<br />dollar-denominated accounts, but the same principles apply to all other<br />currency (or precious metal)-denominated accounts. Also for the<br />remainder of the discussion &quot;dollars&quot; will refer to traditional USD (in<br />cash, legacy banking system instruments, or mainstream services like<br />PayPal) and &quot;vUSD&quot; will refer to USD-denominated balances in the IFB system.<br /><br />Members join the bank by forming a reserve agreement with the IFB. For<br />example, Alice might sign up as a member, agreeing to hold $1000 in<br />reserve, she will make available for redemptions via in person trades,<br />ACH transferrers, or mailed money orders, within 72 hours of any request<br />she receives. When the agreement is accepted, the IFB credits Alice&#039;s<br />account with $1000 in vUSD, which she is free to spend, with the<br />understanding that every vUSD she spends is one she is obligated to<br />redeem in the future.<br /><br />In order to give Alice the incentive to uphold her agreement, and to<br />give customers and other entities a reason to trust the solvency of the<br />IFB (and by extension, the validity of vUSD), the IFB requires Alice to<br />post collateral in order to approve the membership agreement.<br /><br />The IFB trustees hold collateral in the form of the organization&#039;s BTC<br />reserves. Each currency for which the IFB offers deposits is assigned a<br />single, publicly-known bitcoin address. Members deposit their collateral<br />to this address, so any interested member of he public can independently<br />verify the bank&#039;s reserve ratios and thus its solvency.<br /><br />In order to determine the amount of collateral necessary for a given<br />reserve agreement, the IFB will conservatively value bitcoins at 95% of<br />the 200 day simple moving average of the volume-weighted exchange rate.<br />Based on past history, the 200 day SMA for the USD-BTC exchange rate<br />rarely decreases significantly, so this should give the bank plenty of<br />opportunity to maintain solvency.<br /><br />The bank will periodically check to see which members have excess<br />collateral based on improvements in the exchange rate. Those members<br />with excess collateral could request a BTC refund, or could receive<br />additional vUSD credit. The bank will never issue vUSD to a member<br />without an explicit agreement, because the member is responsible for<br />holding as many vUSD as they have been issued in reserve to fulfill<br />redemption requests.<br /><br />A member closes their account by returning all the vUSD they have ever<br />been issued back to the IFB, who then returns the collateral and takes<br />the vUSD out of circulation. If a member does not possess enough vUSD to<br />close their account, BTC from the reserve address is sold on the open<br />market for vUSD to make up the difference, and the amount of BTC sold is<br />subtracted from their collateral. This is also the same procedure that<br />would be used if a member defaults.<br /><br />In the event of a prolonged reduction in the BTC exchange rate, the bank<br />will request additional BTC collateral and/or return of vUSD from its<br />members prior to insolvency in an action similar to a margin call.<br /><br />The computing infrastructure for the IFB will be built on Open<br />Transactions, with servers distributed around the world both in the<br />public Internet, and in the major anonymization networks. vUSD will be<br />issued by the IFB, and will be tradable on any OT servers and any other<br />services which implement the OT protocol. By adding OT support to their<br />platforms, cryptocurrency exchanges can allow their users to move fiat<br />between their exchange accounts and their IFB balances. This his how the<br />IFB will provide fiat liquidity to the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem.<br /><br />IFB customers need an easy way to locate IFB members near them, or<br />otherwise willing to exchange dollars to and from vUSD. In order to<br />accomplish this, the IFB could potentially work closely with LocalBitcoins<br />(LB). IFB members will list on LB just like traders there already do, and the<br />process of conducting trades will be identical to the existing process,<br />but instead of trading to and from BTC, they will trade to and from vUSD.<br /><br />Bob is a LB user who wants to buy bitcoins. He logs on to his account<br />and sees that his wallet contains $0 and 0 BTC. The first thing he does<br />is find a trader willing to load up his dollar account, either via in<br />person cash trade or some type of online trade (the same as the two<br />existing trade types on LB). Once Bob provides this, the seller releases<br />the escrow and Bob now has a dollar balance in his wallet. From this<br />point, Bob can simply click the &quot;Buy Bitcoins Now&quot; button and the site<br />will execute a market order behind the scenes and credit his BTC<br />balance, or he could navigate to the trading section of the site and<br />conduct his own trades. When he decides he wants to cash out some<br />dollars, he does the exact same process in reverse: finding a trader<br />willing to buy his vUSD for a local cash or online sale. IFB members are<br />allowed to set their own commission on trades, with LB taking their fee<br />as well, in the same way the site is already structured.<br /><br />Should LocalBitcoins prove to be uninterested in such an arrangement, it<br />would be possible to partner with another site, or create a new site<br />specifically for the IFB.<br /><br />The advantage of restructuring LB in this way is that it allows the site<br />to focus on the P2P interactions, while the currency trading is taken<br />care of by a dedicated engine (perhaps based on Buttercoin). With the<br />IFB providing liquidity and LB providing the customer interface, the<br />Bitcoin ecosystem will become much more resilient to legal and banking<br />attacks. This arrangement allows the members of the IFB to leverage<br />their collective dollar liquidity, which is a resource that is too<br />distributed to be effectively regulated or censored. As long as<br />individuals are allowed to conduct financial transactions with other<br />individuals, the IFB will be able to manage large dollar flows without<br />relying directly on the legacy financial system, in a manner that would be<br />extremely difficult to regulate or censor.<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Comment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org<br /><br />iQIcBAEBCgAGBQJSFY7gAAoJEILQpxmt+6JWcH0P/j4eWnNsDqDOXQYBB8wFjuO6<br />sMqZfC0mc9NUh1M4Qyd529pqhU5trA6x6aZqkm+GH7IzSxDrc2NmlCCiYlEC0LvK<br />bx7o1vVK5fhYuonPVsWjFlWEBdqk3RI/Vmbs2estg42n73pPybIc9RX3f1hGKf3J<br />0PMSicIcY/yDlFOjoyLA+D2CFO2gbplAayK0TbXEL6oIfL5SQEHj6MYc1RoFDRlt<br />bTm2cUYAEkneqmSrIUtAL7T0Cx7kMtAPVhxYjcR/j+5pT1eQDyHSGq3u1SblEsl6<br />TxFkKw45f5xqiIw8Q+bg/YUERK2ntJcL7/LK/gyQh9SDe9CaF8izPsixNvbcSlAJ<br />/JB6IMCMywUHBlBvINfnRCYjwX6i51Gf6lQs41St6YkfG7M5dsqwhUDGWZKR8Llc<br />hA+4LOwgvA5R6fi9+V0jbY1kpvCH2U6SSxqYnopmjdwpDWW9+qXBanwZr6Zw6BBF<br />kDQTh4Hylag/D5OZnbDdCGujWunyWp7TQ7C8RU5XFCv8d2ixwI6v3KCcELLJkLpI<br />/L2ErDnOa0zlHW74ElDAQC7vYLqZYBx+9IyStt3eDvBF2HBLifX00AmdLHaTV0oA<br />pjV8Dw+53Kg9J2sEhNj/dag3XTfSXKgtbeO2RNZOW3c+FYIJxSVIUnza67utzWFY<br />iEKKQ93/SK2XisfhMb38<br />=708p<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
