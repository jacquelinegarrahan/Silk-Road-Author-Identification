				Its a smaller operation with less moderation and monitoring, you can sometimes find things cheaper than on here, that&#039;s there main selling point, but its also full of scammers and has no where near the product listing your find on here. It loves to say its the SR competition, but its got a long way to go before it can raise a stake to that claim!

				I browsed as well and believe there are a few legit sellers and good prices but it just doesn&#039;t feel as safe or professional as sr.

				I started out there as the bond was lower, <br />I don&#039;t think there was more scammers per say as feedback is a bit better and very rarely do they ask you FE but there was more vendors new to the game for sure. <br /><br />One thing I did notice there was 1 cent joints everywhere as people are keen to make their mark there too.

				there are a handful of vendors who are on both SR and Atlantis and I would guess 100% of them do far more business on SR. As far as prices go, it all evens out in the end really. Some vendors charge somewhat high prices, others offer introductory deals. The key is to find someone you can rely on, which is worth an incalculable amount of coins in my opinion. There is more of a selection of vendors to find that one to put your trust in on SR, but that doesn&#039;t mean it is impossible to find on Atlantis. As long as you do your due diligence by feeling around the forums and reading reviews / feedback, there is no difference between the sites besides Litecoin being accepted on Atlantis.&nbsp;

				No need to cancel it if you&#039;re not going to use it.&nbsp; What connection do they have to you if it&#039;s a different account name and all?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.
