				<br />What country do you live in?<br /><br />To be honest I have only used this site in england but im sure it is good for pretty much any country. It is a very good site <br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ ( WARNING CLEARNET)<br /><br />It is pretty much just a listing site for people to advertise there service of selling bitcoins. It has a good feedback and escrow system much like SR. For example at the moment if you are in England there is a dude called arachnic13 selling them for the exact same as the current MTGOX Price. Which is wicked. <br /><br />The site has a build in wallet for each account holder. Use follow the on screen instructions, buy the coins and then send them to your SR Waller. Simple!<br /><br />Clockwork

				Agreed, BitInstant is great. You can have it send to an address instead of coinapult too. Also look into Bitcoin Fog Company, or other BTC tumblers. They basically wash your coins for a small fee so no one knows where they came from/went.<br /><br />Personally, I use localbitcoins. It&#039;s sort of like a drug deal, but you&#039;re not doing anything illegal and there&#039;s no pressure or any shady feeling. I&#039;ve built a relationship with my trader, and he&#039;s really nice and accommodating. Plus this is completely anonymous. <br /><br />Bitinstant wants a phone # now-a-days. So if this is what you&#039;re thinking of using, I&#039;d recommend getting a throw-a-away celly. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				I used Bitinstant for my first two bitcoin purchases. Since then I have used Blue Sky Traders because of their great reviews in the Rumor Mill Forum. <br /><br />You send them an email with your request and your SR wallet. They reply with instructions to make a cash deposit in their bank of america account (so there needs to be a branch near where you live).&nbsp; You go to the branch, fill out a deposit slip (none of your info is required) and hand it to the teller with the cash. The coins are in your wallet very quickly.

				Bitinstant had some problems for some people apparently, but I&#039;ve used them and it worked out just fine. I have my friends go to get the coins for me with instructions if thats the route I&#039;m taking, although the fees do such. RXking, is a reputable vendor on here who does a straight exchange of cash thru WU(using fake names and such) for BTC straight to your SR account for larger amounts, and he also pays ALL of the WU fees, unlike going thru bitinstant..&nbsp; I know its a big leap of faith to take, but it&#039;s worked for hundreds, maybe thousands of us on SR.

				Bitinstant -&gt; non-SR wallet -&gt; SR wallet worked fine for me last week. In fact, the transfer from bitinstant -&gt; my other wallet was done in &lt; 15min. Probably less than that, because it was 20 min from the time I got the zipzap slip to the time I got the coins, including driving to a moneygram location. I do know they&#039;ve been inconsistent in the past couple months though.
