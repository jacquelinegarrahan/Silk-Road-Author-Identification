				Hello, I&#039;m asking for advice on how to open my mind while using LSD. I&#039;ve never used LSD yet, because it&#039;s impossible to find in my area. All I&#039;ve found in my area is DOI and 2ci. I ordered two hits of LSD from Tess, and they should be here any day. I wanna explore parts of my mind that have been locked away. I wanna better myself as a person overall. I would also, if possible, like to use LSD as a therapy, if you will, to help shake my addiction to cigarettes. <br />With that being said, what are some things I can do to get into the correct mindset? What should I surround myself with? Questions of that nature.<br />Thank you.

				the best advice that i ever heard for my first trip was to forget any idea of what it might be like and go along for the ride. as far as cigarettes go, i usually find that during the trip, i will chainsmoke like there&#039;s no tomorrow, but after the trip, they kinda just lose their attraction

				I agree with above. Looking/waiting for things to happen kinda spoils it. <br /><br />I&#039;m new to LSD too, and I&#039;m finding that settings and surroundings are important, ie, comfortable and safe. Then just try and forget you&#039;ve taken it. Don&#039;t clock-watch, and don&#039;t stare at stuff trying to figure out if it&#039;s moving or whatever.<br /><br />Start small, and just let it happen.<br /><br />Some people recommend a &#039;sitter&#039; be present. Someone sober who can stop you from eating the cushions am stuff (lol), but in my experience, I didn&#039;t bother with that. Just keep calm and enjoy the ride.<br />Maybe have a couple of benzos to-hand if it gets a bit hectic and you wanna take the edge off.<br /><br />Main thing, relax and enjoy it.<br /><br />

				Just roll with it... you&#039;ll start to see things as they are and somethings as they are not and start to question the reason you believe the things that you believe.... I&#039;ve broken all my cigs on an LSD trip and stopped smoking for a few weeks but have always found myself back on them after reality takes over again... though i do think i could have stopped... good luck and happy hunting

				Thank you, everyone, for the advice. I wanna add that I have tripped on DOI, so I have the basic idea of an LSD trip, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be more &quot;majestic&quot; this time. <br />And I already planned on having a sitter. Can never be too safe!

				The past 6 months have been really eye opening for me thanks to LSD. Its an absolutely beautiful chemical and can really help a person for the better if taken responsibly. As Leary said, its all in the &quot;set and setting.&quot; I recommend dosing with a very close friend and just spend your trip chatting, especially on topics of life and spirituality. Youll see reality what for it really is. Im beginning to find my inner peace and spirituality as a person, and owe it to LSD. I dont want to say that its all because of the chemical, but it definitely opened my eyes to what is important in life. Love and friends. I wish you the best of luck with your journeys :)

				My tip is:<br />First began to write down the things you like about yourself.<br />Then write what you have problems with.<br />Then things you are afraid of, write on three different pieces.<br /><br />Find a safe environment where YOU feel is nothing can go wrong.<br />Give the note you wrote to a friend that YOU are comfortable with and will not take lsd itself.<br /><br />He will be your guide during the trip.<br />He can be exchanged environment and help minimize the risk of flipping and finding the right

				Hello space cadet,<br /><br />So you are interested in exploring the universe. Don&#039;t worry! There are plenty of experience cosmonauts happy to guide you along. Here are some of my policies when taking medium to large amounts of LSD. *Note that the same rules can apply to small amounts by I tend to be a lot more liberal with myself/environment when on low doses.<br /><br />Rules/Suggestions (The only real &quot;rules/laws&quot; are those of physics. Nothing is truly forbidden.)<br /><br />-Be in a safe environment. Your home or a close friend&#039;s home is the best spot. You will be comfortable and familiar with the things there and more ready to handle them in an expanded mindset.<br />-Have all of the necessary means of survival. This one is pretty obvious. Availability of food, shelter, a bathroom, water, first aid, and a working phone are basic necessities. Having them around you is simply a good thing.<br />-Get the right number of people. 2-4 is in my humble opinion the best number. I find that when alone, a feeling of loneliness can set in, especially when your mind begins to expand beyond your ego. Plus socializing and comparing experiences is a ton of fun :)<br />-Pick the right people. The last thing you want is the drama queen/king who will make a big deal out of everything and force their presence on you. The chiller they are, the better they are to trip with. If you know anyone who is ludicrously smart then, so long as they are chill enough, trip with them. It is a blast.<br />-Don&#039;t have anything to do on days you trip. Seriously. I can&#039;t stress this enough. The last thing you want is the weight of responsibility and consequently guilt in your subconscious or conscious. A friend of mine, upon experiencing loss of ego, decided his trip had lessened the universe because it removed his ability to achieve a goal he decided his body was required to achieve. Extreme example? Sure. But it paints the picture. Guilt is a trip killer.&nbsp; <br />-Now to soften that blow a bit. I don&#039;t really think, given a medium to mid-strong dosage, you can have a disaster trip. I&#039;ve yet to see it happen or hear of it happen from anyone I know. This is taking into account people of all types of personality including a few with histories of mental instability. Try to get excited about the new things you are doing rather than get nervous about the potential problems. LSD is incredibly safe, beloved by those whom know it, and a wonderful experience. Ignore popular media&#039;s portrayal and see for yourself.<br />-Ok. This one is gonna catch me some flak. I still stand by it. Try not to be around sober people. The experience, especially the first one, is much better when you don&#039;t have someone tethering you to earth. LSD is not nearly as debilitating as people pass it off to be. You should be able to converse, perceive, and generally function at nearly the same capacity as when you are sober. If anything bad enough happens that you would need a sitter then you will be more than functional enough to remedy the issue.<br /><br />Well. That&#039;s my 2 cents. If you have any questions just post &#039;em here or send me a message.<br /><br />Happy journeys,<br />Smith.
