If a 11 year old girl gets on here and knows what she wants, who are we to deny her?<br /><br />We are not her parents, and her parents are obviously incompetent as hell if she&#039;s here rather than at her doctor asking for drugs.<br /><br />That isn&#039;t to say doctors are NOT incompetent, but it&#039;s not like denying teenagers drugs is going to make their lives any better.<br /><br />At least on SR, the drugs are very high quality, the teenagers have relative anonymity, and are unlikely to get stabbed in the gut and left to die slowly in some gutter somewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;d much rather have teens buying drugs here than one some shitty stabhappy street somewhere.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d say vendors should never sell to anyone who is 11 yrs of age.<br /><br />Imagine in real life if an 11 yr old asked for a gram of heroin? Would you sell it? I doubt it very much.<br /><br />Even 13 yr olds, sorry but they ARE children, they should be in school getting educated not listening to DJ Whomever and snorting coke, heroin or even smoking a ciggarrette!<br /><br />Drugs are for adults.<br /><br />Children would not be able to buy alcohol unless they are aged 18.<br /><br />I would not dream of selling drugs to any child. <br /><br />And if someone sold heroin to my daughter when she was 11, I&#039;d give him unconciousness for free. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;ve never used heroin and never will.<br /><br />Its just too addictive - its too good for most to never use again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And prey tell how does said vendor on the road assure against selling to an 11yr old? <br />Its anonymous dont have to fill out a form with your birthday on it (not that you cant just lie on them)<br />An 11 or 13 or even 15 yr old is not most likely to buy heroin off here for the first time they use it if they are after a gram logic dictates have have used before and failing that they would just buy it off the street with christ knows what in it to cut it&nbsp; <br />I can tell you in my country there is 11yr old heroin addicts a product of there enviroment

				Ouch what a thread - think the OP got lost in translation.<br /><br />As for selling anything illicit to kids that&#039;s a big no no in my book.<br />I can generally discern who is an adult by the way they write while it&#039;s not fool proof it&#039;s the best at my disposal also younger people tend to brag try impress which is another useful signal. SMS txt speech type communications are cut off immediately no qualms. I would never work with the OP of this thread seems unhinged.<br /><br />Peace

				No vendor knows the age of their customers.<br /><br />Any kid who can install tor and figure out how to get bitcoins and find the Silk Road is determined enough to find it from some junky on the streets. Either the kid already has an addiction or he is hell bent to try it.
