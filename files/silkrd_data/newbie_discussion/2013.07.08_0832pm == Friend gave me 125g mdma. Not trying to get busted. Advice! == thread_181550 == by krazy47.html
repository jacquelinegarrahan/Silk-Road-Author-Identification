				My friend has been dealing in person for quite some time now. Hes pretty big and has some homies underneath him getting rid of it all... Hes been giving to the same kids for quite some time now..<br /><br />Anyways, he left the country and after making nearly a half million, he handed me his last 150g of nice Amsterdam mdma. I showed him this website and how to work btc, so I guess he felt thats the way to pay me back.<br /><br />However, I am not really into making aliving selling. I like to hook my friends up with little personal ammounts, but nothing more. I dont want people dealing under me...<br /><br />However, I still have like 125g left. Ive been hooking up my friends homies (the older dealers peddlers), and just losing mad sleep over it...<br /><br />My friend tells me as long as these guys come by themselves to my house/apt then I have nothing to worry about. And if I am really paranoid, make sure no one else is in their car...<br /><br />I know none of these guys are under covers because of all the mutual friends, but I am worried about them getting popped and setting me up... <br /><br />Obviously the best answer is save my treasure/throw it out, but I cant just throw that out, and I cant just have 125g of a scheduled one substance in my house/apt which frequently has parties, but at long as these guys are coming by themselves im straight right?

				You will be fine with 125g. If you are really worried take like half of it or however much you know you wont use for a long while, vac seal it and throw it in the bottom of a plant pot or something like that. Hell, if you want to sell it quick go to a club and find someone who is selling molly. Ask him what he pays and under cut his dealer for a 1 time offer. You should be able to sell ounces no problem if you show them it is quality 1st.

				Figure out some stealth packaging and get a vendor account. That is enough MDMA to make some good money and get your bond back.<br /><br />If you do it right it is safer than dealing to your friends. If you keep doling out small amounts to a small goup you will become known as the &quot;MDMA guy&quot; before you get through 50g.

You&#039;re asking what to do with FREE DRUGS? Are you serious? <br /><br />Dump it. Either in the river if you&#039;re that scared, or on one of your &quot;homies&quot;. <br /><br />If I had that much free Molly, I&#039;d dump the ENTIRE lot at $20/g and be done with it. It&#039;s free, so there isn&#039;t any profit margin to worry about. It&#039;s 100% profit.

				Everyone is really missing the point here..... <br /><br />I am asking, if I have sold these guys some weight before, and no po po came knocking on my door, its safe to say I can unload my stash to them??<br /><br />Selling molly at 10/g is still selling a scheduled 1 drug<br /><br />

				Usually only happens if one of those dudes gets popped then narks you out.... <br /><br />Moves up the food chain to receive less time in exchange... Doesn&#039;t seem like you can trust these guys.. You have already sold it to them. Sell the rest and be done with it.

				I guess. If your friend vouched for them, then you should be fine. Only deal with them directly. No one else.

Not only has my friend been hooking them up for awhile, they know how the game works. They almost laugh when I make it a point to come alone, because they know the procedure. Not only did my friend hook these kids up, other of my well trusted friends vouch saying as far as they know they are any avg person.<br /><br />I was so sketched one time I just told the kid I was going to drop it somewhere and then drop some cash... He actually did it... No issues.

				There is always some risk but there are ways to mitigate it such as using a dead drop.

				Find a small handful of people who like it, then just sell it at $70 a gram to them as they keep wanting more and more. You&#039;ll go through it fast as hell if it&#039;s good stuff.
