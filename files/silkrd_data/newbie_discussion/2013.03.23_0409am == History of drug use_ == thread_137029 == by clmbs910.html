				Just curious: folks new to SR, how many of you are looking for a new market to augment your existing drug habits? How many are curious and using SR as a gateway to new drugs or to try drugs for the first time?&nbsp; Anyone here for another reason entirely? LIke, to buy other blackmarket goods/services?

				I think most people were existing drug users, as was I. What attracted me was the range of quality drugs, So yes very gateway. I have tried many drugs I maybe wouldn&#039;t have due to availability.<br />But It still doesn&#039;t make more likely to bang some H. So I don&#039;t know if being able to use the drugs that I want would make me less likely to try something that I wouldn&#039;t usually do because its the only thing available or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thanks, BoNgOn. I&#039;m just curious about how SR works to augment exisit drug culture, or whether it is creating its own, new drug culture. Not that it&#039;s black &amp; white exactly--clearly it&#039;s doing both...<br /><br />I hardly use drugs at all, but I like them, I&#039;m interested in them, and I feel like SR could be a game-changer...

				I use it to get more pure drugs then getting ripped off from the street, also I read alot about harm reduction as I recently started using sharps and dont want the family to find out so I try find beneficial posts for body repair etc.<br /><br />It has opened up a phase of trying new drugs recently, trying to get as fucked as possible on all different drugs at the same time is an awesome feeling if you know your limits!
