				anyone purchased anything from this guy?&nbsp; he seems to have 37 good transactions but on a second look they are all in a period of about 1 week 15-25 days ago and now all new items are listed.&nbsp; it sucks tou can&#039;t see who the feedback is from to see if they are real buyers or just ghost accounts.&nbsp; also it says he has been a member for a year but all his feedback is recent?<br /><br />here&#039;s his seller&#039;s page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/80ac6ef804/10

				Hey there,<br /><br />I&#039;m legit and I guess all those mofucking samples I mailed out to those SOB&#039;s were for nothing. Three of those peeps said they would make me a review page on this shit. I&#039;m in it to win it and won&#039;t to spread that shit like fire. Only reason my account was a year old with no tans. for that time was because I was nervous as shit to use this site. Please feel free to shoot me a message on SR any time, I doubt I&#039;ll check this shit very often if ever. Thanks to the people that have ordered through me and the people that nabbed all those free samples, you guys are the opposite of awesome!<br /><br />RB123

				Free sample = Review. Always. <br />It&#039;s for YOUR benefit people.<br />Personally I&#039;ve started two review threads for two vendors. <br />Just needs a few details. Speed of delivery, stealth packaging quality, cost, and of course product quality.<br /><br />New vendors *need* to demonstrate they are trust-worthy and have good product.<br />Review threads help a lot with this.<br /><br />More vendors = more choice for you when buying. <br /><br /><br />Shame on you, whoever just took the freebie and did a runner.

				First off,&nbsp; no offense RB123, you may just be new but...<br />Did you do the invite for samples via PM, because there is literally no open invitation anywhere on the forums.<br />The number of orders completed, with the lack of forum presence and the interesting feedback and product listing just makes me think scammy.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been here a year, you should know to lead with an intro in the product offers or to create your own review thread.<br />If you have a number of vials, why not part one out into some hits and send samples that way, minimizes your risk and customers are likely to jump onboard quickly.
