				&nbsp;I originally wanted to send my love to project 4 but cannot post in that section so I will go ahead and briefly contribute my own experience .<br />&nbsp;I thought this site was too good to be true and now I wonder how I managed without it.&nbsp; Just did my 3rd order and I laugh at how I worried in the past. It is just mail. I am at peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;I also want to thank all previous posters for helping me nut up. You all made it possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />project 4 -&nbsp; words cannot properly express the love that I have for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks!

				There&#039;s someone that hangs around here who will place reviews in the regular forums if we ask. I forget who it is though and can&#039;t find their thread. Maybe he/she will drop in here.
