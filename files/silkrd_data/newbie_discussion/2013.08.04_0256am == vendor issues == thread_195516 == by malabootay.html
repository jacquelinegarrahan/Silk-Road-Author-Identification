				Sorry I&#039;m a dumb ass I dont even know how to see if they read it. I have left 3 messages just seeing if he had seen the order. Not one response in over 24hrs. Kind of sucks for my first purchase to go this way. What do I do if I don&#039;t get any response. Use the report vendor tab or what? I really just want to cancel now but it won&#039;t let me just shows money in escrow. Please help the noob

				Don&#039;t jump the gun dude . This stuff doesn&#039;t always go exactly how you think they will. We are talkin drug deals here. Just don&#039;t freak out and start talkin canceling so quick.<br />Go to your messages page on SR. Hit the link for &quot;sent&quot; messages . The message links will be in bold lettering if they are not read yet.

				Dude, just chill.&nbsp; 24 hrs is not long...remember what type of business you&#039;re actually engaging in..this isn&#039;t amazon.&nbsp; Also, it is the weekend, even if it says &quot;in transit&quot; it aint actually moving and sellers, believe it or not, have lives of there own.&nbsp; It takes 4 days for the cancel button to show.&nbsp; So just be calm and don&#039;t freak, your funds are safe in escrow, you&#039;ll be good.

				Thanks guys. It shows 2 messages read. Last one has not. I&#039;d be happy with a &quot;stop fuckin blowing up my inbox dude I got the order&quot;. I guess I was hoping for a nice and smooth transaction for the first time. Oh well, I will just wait and see.

				I don&#039;t place orders on weekends for just this reason. I like to watch the progress from processing to &quot;in transit&quot; etc, etc. I know on weekends things just won&#039;t be the same.

				stoned vendors can be slow ;) but as an experience volume fast shipper 1) usps last pick up for Saturday is 12pm - 4pm depending on location... so if the vender was couch locked... he&#039;s banking on the 4 days to ship SR offers... USPS will not pick up until Monday 5pm and vendors Never go wait in line at the post office. so from Monday night you may feel that package start to move or Tuesday... that&#039;s just how usps roll&#039;s: slow! no incentive to move any faster... just trudging through thousands of packages trying to make it through another day waiting to retire ... have mercy on the poor bastards ... <br />vendors: &quot;the golden goose is always better then 1 gold egg&quot; (more on that later)

				Before you make another order, you should probably just relax for a minute and wait till Monday. If it&#039;s still processing and you get no response you only have one day to wait until you can cancel your order. Weekends are always slow for everyone.

				I hope your order was for Xanax. Sounds like you need it.&nbsp; ;D. I&#039;ve placed quite a few orders, and never felt the need to message a vendor just to see if they got my order. Of course they did. It wasn&#039;t until I got my first automated message from SR Support 10 days after the package was marked in transit, that I even thought of messaging the vendor. It just slows them down if they have 100&#039;s of messages to go through each day.

				Chill out. The vendor has your order. Soon, he will either mark it as in transit, or he will cancel it. If he doesn&#039;t, you can cancel it yourself after 4 days.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to spam his inbox with your messages, and if he is a busy vendor he probably has a policy of not responding to messages like that.<br /><br />The only thing that you should check at this stage is his vendor profile page, to see if he requires early finalisation for new buyers. If he does, out of courtesy he ought to send you a message telling you so, but he may not. If he does require FE for buyers like you, then you need to wait until he has marked it as &#039;in transit&#039;, and then you need to finalise. FE at your own discretion. We tend not to like FE around here but is is unfortunately a necessary evil for many new users of the road.<br />

Well, maybe a little. :-) Just don&#039;t want you stressing about something out of your control. Even when you spend hours researching feedback before choosing who to buy from, there is still vendors that will disappoint you with their communication and shipping. Others don&#039;t work weekends, or have full-time day jobs. Most of my purchases have been received in a week from ordering. International, I&#039;d count on 2 weeks. <br /><br />PS: I probably have more purchases then posts. So little time.
