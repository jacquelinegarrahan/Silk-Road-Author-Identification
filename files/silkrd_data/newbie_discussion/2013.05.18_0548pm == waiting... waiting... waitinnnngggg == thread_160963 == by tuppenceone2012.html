				Looks like he&#039;s scammed a good few thousand pounds worth of customers and disappeared - I doubt he&#039;ll return.<br /><br />Why the fuck are people FE&#039;ing on big orders? - it&#039;s beyond me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Look at his latest feedback - even a few pages back he was at it, yet people still FE&#039;d. <br /><br />SERIOUSLY GUYS WAKE THE FUCK UP AND NEVER FE<br /><br />But to the OP - it sounds like you haven&#039;t finalised so atleast you&#039;ll get your coin back, and it shouldn&#039;t be too long if SR have revoked his vendor rights. You should get your coins back pretty soon - but yeah just be patient mate.

The process that is in place is there for a reason; it protects both buyers and sellers in the event that something goes wrong.
