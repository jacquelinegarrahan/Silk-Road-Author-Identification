				This thread will contain useful information and links to internal [forum] threads and resources and approved [external] websites and resources. This thread is a great resource for any new comer who is looking for tips on buying from vendors on Silk Road, using BitCoins and Tor itself in general. Please take some time and look through the resources provided below before making a purchase or using Silk Road. All credit goes to the authors of the threads, websites and resources provided, I&#039;m only making this thread as an AIO &#91;&#039;all in one&#039;] resource for newcomers or those who want to get the most out of their Silk Road experience, safely. Please note, neither I, administrators, moderators, or other members of Silk Road, or Silk Road forums are responsible for your safety when going on external websites, always use caution and common sense. Use [external] resources at your own risk. Most are approved to be safe to browse, but that may change at any time. <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to take the time and request you to submit any useful links you&#039;d like to see or to be in this thread or if you have made a useful thread or guide, please submit it here so I can add it to the list. I don&#039;t think we need tutorials on how to setup or use Tor, since you&#039;re already browsing an .onion website you probably already have the knowledge how Tor works. But if you&#039;d like to know more about Tor or how to set it up more securely you&#039;re more than free to reply to this thread and ask and someone will surely assist you.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------[Internal] Guides--------------------------------------------------<br />---------------------------------------------------Everything Silk Road, Buying, Selling &amp; Safety Related------------------------<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page [OFFICIAL] (Silk Road Wiki) - Please read the Wiki, it contains all of the information you need.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide [OFFICIAL] (Silk Road&#039;s Buyers Guide)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112029 (A Very Comprehensive Guide to Silk Road &amp; Other Things)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383 (All in One Guide on Using Silk Road Anonymously)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112872.0 (U.K Buying Guide)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11784 (U.K Royal Mail Guide for Silk Road Vendors)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46692 (U.K Guide for Buying BitCoins)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85401 (Guide to BitCoins Through BitInstant and Walmart)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=48212 (Guide on Removing Virtual Memory Paging Data [Unintended saved RAM data])<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7832 (Isolating Firefox from Tor with Virtualbox)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141 (How to install Tails onto a USB with Persistent Volume)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39320 (Pine&#039;s Tutorial On Stopping LE Malware With a Virtual Machine)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8235 (An OSX Tutorial for Setting up Tormail with Thunderbird/Enigmail)<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------[External] Guides--------------------------------------------------<br />---------------------------------------------------Everything Silk Road, Buying, Selling &amp; Safety Related------------------------<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/ (GPG4USB Tutorial)<br />http://torvpn.com/access_onion_sites.html [Clear Net] (Tor/Onion Tutorial)<br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en [Clear Net] (Tor/Orbot Tutorial)<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------[Internal] Guides &amp; Websites------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------------------------Everything Drugs Related---------------------------------------------<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048 (MDMA Rolling Guidelines)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------[External] Guides &amp; Websites------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------------------------Everything Drugs Related---------------------------------------------<br /><br />~None at the moment, this section will be updated shortly.~<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------Other Useful Resources &amp; Info----------------------------------------<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/anonymousanon/sfp/forum.html (Paper Describing a Highly-Secured Forum System)<br />http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion/ (The Tor Library [E-Books])<br />http://p2uekn2yfvlvpzbu.onion/ (LiberaTor [E-Books])<br />http://hq3hmoa4thdplmta.onion/index.php (Heidenwut [Tutorials])<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------Other Interesting Stuff-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110816 (Lucid Dream Tutorial)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please note these lists are nowhere near to being complete, more and more guides and resources will be added each day as new threads and new submissions are added/received.<br /><br />~Cooler.

				Kudos to you for putting this together! I know that a lot of new buyers will benefit from this thread; you covered a lot of the great security threads that I can remember but I will keep an eye out for other good ones. There&#039;s a couple of worthy OVDB information dumps in its subforum that I thought were cool - I&#039;ll try and dig them up. :)<br /><br />My only other tips:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Put the PGP tutorial/PGP club right up at the top of the thread/list. I would argue it&#039;s the single most important thing a newbie can do to improve their security and many of them don&#039;t realize how EASY it is with the help of all the great people here on the forums!<br /><br />- For Canadian bitcoin buyers I recommend www.canadianbitcoins.com - they&#039;ve been around for a while and I can vouch for their services. Cash in the mail is one of the easiest, most secure ways of getting BTC.

				Guys I need help ASAP!!! for some reason i could not find out how to post for the longest time and after like 3 days of going through this forum, i realized that newbies can only post in a very few discussions...I think i figured that part out, AND I am soooo glad that my buddy told me about this place!!! It is a GODSEND!! I am sooo proud of the creators of this site because they are now offering me a safe way to get quality drugs.&nbsp; I have very strong beliefs that we should be able to decide for ourselves what is OK for our bodies! anywayz, i need to get some damn BC on my account, But i dont fuckn know how, i clicked on the account thing and they gave me some long ass web adress to deposit funds so i am assuming i have to use that, and should i keep this private or can i give it out?. Thank you sooo much in advance for any answers or responses to this statement/?.
