				Yeah a gay friend of mine told me it was awesome so I tried it a year or so ago, tried quite a few like Kronic and Silver Haze etc. LOL, one day I had this crazy one called &quot;Red Bull&quot; like the energy drink, I had about 4 bongs of it and suddenly it felt like I was going to die!! <br /><br />Crazy shit sometimes! You gotta watch out which fake cannabinoids they put it in I smoke the non-synthetic herbals now when I don&#039;t have choof!

				Synthetic cannabinoids must be respected to harness their value. They are usually stronger than any top notch hydro, people think that just coz it&#039;s legal they would have to have more to acheive the effect. Another bonus of synthetic cannabinoid powder is that you can soak it into tobacco and cigarettes so you can get stoned in public without anyone knowing. I was smoking a cigarette with this in it casually talking to a cop in malaysia, he had no idea I was getting baked in front of him!
