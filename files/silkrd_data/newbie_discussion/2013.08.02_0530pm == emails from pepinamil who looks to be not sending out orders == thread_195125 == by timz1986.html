				Timz<br /><br />I got the same emails from that guy. I think he is trying to get some orders in so he can start back up but by the looks of his feedback he has been scamming people or he is just plain bad at this kind of work. :)<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />M<br /><br />

				Pepinamil as a new vendor, probably need some more experience. <br />A couple of weeks ago I recieved my blow from pepinamil in europe. Didn&#039;t use a tester but the product was quite pleasant, no irritation to my nose. Stealth package was also quite good. <br />To be honest, for that price I wish I could order more often, then only once in 3 months.

				I do not appreciate being SPAMMED by vendors &gt;:(<br /><br />Yes, me too! PEPINAMIL is a spammer and not a very good shipper!! Only 3 of the last 20 feedback actually received anything. Why do people leave 5/5 for a 50% refund? I could understand it if only a few packages went missing but when 17 out of 20 do not arrive, it seems highly likely you have just lost 50% of your coins the second you order. Sounds like a good scam to me. Pretend to ship something then get 5/5 feedback and keep half the coins for doing nothing. I think Ill sent up a vendor account right now.
