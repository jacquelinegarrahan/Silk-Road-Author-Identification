				Taking drugs via your penis hole is the only way you should be taking them. I usually smoke my joints that way as well, only downfall is people hate sharing joints with you.

				I&#039;ll admit it; if i was 10 or 15 years younger i would have tried it before researching it first! One of my biggest quotes before going to the hospital when i was younger was &quot;hey dude, check this out! Lol

				The biggest difficulty is getting it in deep enough, like you push it through but it doesn&#039;t get very far after entering your knob. <br /><br />Solution?... Paper clip!!! After unraveling, you can use it to push the Xanax (hell even 25i as its a great way to absorb this chemical) even further down the hole. <br /><br />Congratulations!!!! You are now a plumber, time to go make an honest living fixing people&#039;s pipes.

Go for it and let us know how it worked out for you. I&#039;d love to get a review before trying it myself. <br />I&#039;ve had some mitigated feelings about it, as since I did some blotters a few days ago, the swelling hasn&#039;t quite reduced. I reckon I should be fine if I crushed it to powder?
