				Noob here, testing the waters. Question is, do most of you on the forums here use the same user ID as your SR account?&nbsp; Seems like most of the vendors do in order to promote business and respond to feedback, but what about the buyers?<br /><br />I know that there could be security risks to linking your open admittance to illicit activity to the account in which you&#039;re actually engaging in the activity. However, one of the purposes of this forum (among many) is to provide reviews and feedback of the quality of the products you&#039;ve purchased, for other potential buyers and the vendors.&nbsp; Using the same ID in both accounts allow the vendor to identify you easily when you give good reviews as well as bad ones. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				I use the same ID, as I assumed this is SR also and take every precation when coming here. I did use vastly different passwords. <br /><br />I wanted to interact with the community and the buyers, so I thought it would be a good idea

				Use different passwords just to be safe, but you should never have any problems purely from using the same nickname on SR and the SR forums.&nbsp; If one site is compromised, it would be fairly safe to assume the other is as well, so just keep that in mind, and limit your exposure the same as you would anyway.<br /><br />And of course, don&#039;t use a nickname that links to your real life.

For example if you just got a new frying pan or something that you just posted on twitter, don&#039;t talk about it here too.<br /><br />Definitely use different passwords everywhere.&nbsp; KeePass is popular because it can run portably.&nbsp; The slight inconvenience of copy and pasting a password is worth the extra security.&nbsp; To give an example I&#039;m sure there were people that had the exact same username and password here, on sr, and on tormail.&nbsp; Hopefully they don&#039;t any more..
