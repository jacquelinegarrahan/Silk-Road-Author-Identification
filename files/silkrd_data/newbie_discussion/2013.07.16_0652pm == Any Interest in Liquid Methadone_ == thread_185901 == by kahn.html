				I&#039;ve just recently established a connection for MMT (Methadone Maintenance Treatment) clinic liquid, 100mg doses. This is oral administration ONLY!!! Cannot (should never) be IVd no matter what. It is measured at the clinics lab facility and shipped sealed. Obviously I cannot send the sealed doses as it could be tracked by that.<br />If anyone has any interest, I will s/u a vendor acct. and go from there. Answer in this topic and we can PM for details. Please don&#039;t ask, I will not go outside the SR system for both our protections.... 8)<br /><br />kahn

				Saved my ass on many &quot;rainy days&quot;&nbsp; ;)<br />Best part is you can stretch it out (100mg) to keep the jones away for days and days.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br />I&#039;m thinking of offering it @ about .75 - .85/mg. (shipping included). What do you think?&nbsp; &nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody? I know there&#039;s enough hardcore guys and gals that could use it.<br /><br />PM me and we can discuss options.......<br /><br />kahn

				I might be interested. I use to be on the needle, and i remember doing an iv of 20mg&#039;s liquid methadone. Buddy had it, and i can&#039;t remember if it was a half cc or 1cc syringe, but either way it literally went to right around the 100 units mark on the needle. That was alot for just 20 mg&#039;s. I got away with it, and didn&#039;t die, but i did alot of stupid things back then. Anyways, i&#039;m expecting a small order of methadone&#039;s 10 mg&#039;s today. Weary of buying liquids of anything off SR, but send me a pm and maybe we can work something out. Thanks.

				The pills are completely different from the liquid the liquid acts faster and lasts longer due to the high sugar levels in it&nbsp; because of this the liquid is used for treatment/replacement therapy and the pills are for pain relief <br />drago73 yes i too have main veined methadone but i mixed mine with water(as instructed by a mate) si the sugar didn&#039;t block the tip I had a 20ml barrel 5ml methadone and 5ml water i would have looked like the epitome of a junkie

				I just listed some liquid methadone a few minutes ago. Only one available though so it most likely will not last long. 170mg for $120 plus sr fees. Check it out!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6ebb92fc4b<br /><br /><br />Ill even send your shipping costs back if you mention this thread in the address box.&nbsp;
