				We&#039;ve seen a lot of theories floating around about who and why SR is being attacked.&nbsp; But one theory I haven&#039;t seen much of is the fact that taking down SR creates volatility in the bitcoin market.&nbsp; Whenever a crime is committed (and yeah, I think taking down or beloved SR as a crime) I ask, who stands to gain financially or otherwise.&nbsp; In this case, I have to wonder if it&#039;s not the same group that was DDOSing Mt. Gox for the past few weeks to create huge rises and falls in bitcoin price, or perhaps a group another group that realizes this is just a great way to create volatility in the market. <br /><br />We&#039;ve seen the Mt. Gox attacks dwindling because they are becoming less and less effective at getting speculators to panic and sell, so why not attack the other largest group of bitcoin users on the market.&nbsp; Yes, it could be purely coincidence, but I&#039;ve even noticed that after SR had been down for a few days and finally came back online, perhaps because users could finally cash out their wallets, the value of the bitcoin fell pretty dramatically- creating a perfect buying opportunity for hackers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Discuss.
