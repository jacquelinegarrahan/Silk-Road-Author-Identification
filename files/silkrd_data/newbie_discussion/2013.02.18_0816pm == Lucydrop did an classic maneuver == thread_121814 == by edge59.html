				Judging from your post history have you ever ordered from LD? <br /><br />I have multiple times and have been satisfied with every transaction. Just because a few people are up in arms doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s &quot;the norm&quot; nor does it mean that everyone should shit on a vendor who has provided a rather top-tier service *regardless* of the FE part. There are a lot of vendors who require FE and sometimes it just is what it is. <br /><br />If you have any personal experience with ordering from LD and getting burned I would like to hear it, otherwise I&#039;m taking this as the typical ego-validation nonsense that goes on.<br /><br />I felt they were fairly priced, fairly marketed, and were pretty accurate, at least the batch I tested and I am *hoping* the second batch I got is the same, but at the same time if not, you know what, he is doing something and did something that a lot of people can&#039;t manage. Being in the top 2-3% of SR vendors in volume and trying to keep a supply chain like that running without ANY hiccups isn&#039;t an easy thing to do and I&#039;m not surprised that there are some minor issues when you consider the SHEER VOLUME of transactions going on. <br /><br />I mean, hundreds of orders a week, all over the 100 dollar mark, week after week, international, etc... that&#039;s a pretty big commitment for one dude to run successfully even with a fully functioning site. Add to it the sometimes-up sometimes-down nature of SR and it&#039;s just another monkey in the gears.<br /><br />Whatever floats your boat, but I have had no issues with LD and sincerely hope that he gets this thing sorted out, if it really is as widespread as people are claiming, and keeps spreading the LOVE and LIGHT. <br /><br />Aight, I&#039;m out&nbsp; 8)<br />

				You really do think he is a scammer.<br /><br />My 3 theories..<br /><br />1.) His supplier is selling him bunk product and is planning to take over business on the road.<br />2.) All this BS started when he decide to sell his product south of the canadaian border.&nbsp; <br />3.) Avengers have been paid off to move him down.<br /><br />The guy is legit in my eyes.&nbsp; I know people and I know Acid, and he is goodon both parts.<br /><br />

				I have ordered from him and received VERY weak tabs, best guess would be 24ug-27ug per tab, hoping he will answer my PM split a 10 strip with 2 other people got maybe 80-90ug, very clean but very underwhelming to say the least, this was my only order from LD. Currently leaving my feedback to 5/5 until he answers. Note to OP maybe shouting &quot;Fuck Him&quot; isnt the best way to get a positive result out of the situation. Not trying to defend him, but maybe you leave the possibility that an honest mistake was made and you leave some room in there for him to fix it. I am currently in the process of going through the 50 post &quot;garbage&quot; so that I can post on the Avengers thread. Best of luck to you, but maybe you should edit that post and I hope for both our sakes that he will make it right to the people he has wronged.

				I understand, but with thousands of tabs mistakes can be made, all I&#039;m saying is please don&#039;t piss him off to where he just jumps ship and says fuck everyone. That isn&#039;t going to make you happy, it isn&#039;t going to make me happy, or anyone else who has experienced similar problems. Trust me I believe you, I just ate 3.33 and didn&#039;t have anything except light body load, no OEV or CEV to speak of. I&#039;m not very happy about this, but I chose to start out with a 10 strip instead of ordering a 50 strip because I refuse to FE unless I&#039;ve worked with the vendor before. I am hoping he makes this right. But as of right now I&#039;m not able to bring myself to FE for an order of 50 with these kind of quality control issues (or whatever they may be)

I think instead of screaming at someone for something that could be a simple mistake (even on a large scale) has a better chance of being rectified if all partied involved are being sincere and honest. It looks like I&#039;m not the only one with this problem, and I see more reports coming in through this forum and through his feedback, I can only hope that he will make this right in the end. I&#039;m an optimist and I believe that he is not intentionally trying to rip people off, that he will make this right, and will continue to be a valued vendor on SR.

				It looks like your stats are good, I think he is likely to do the right thing.&nbsp; His product is fantastic and I hope the wrinkles get ironed out.&nbsp; I still see lots of positive feedback so I really dont think he is a scammer.&nbsp; Just give him some time for this to blow over.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he has a pile of spam messages right now and the time to get through them all must be unimaginable.

				It&#039;s just odd that the hardest drug to get on SR is LSD, I&#039;ve never known anyone who has done acid and then turned into an asshole. Why is it that it is easier to work with people on the other side of the world for a product that is usually very impure on the street (such as Ketamine or MDMA) and they send without delivery confirmation and don&#039;t have to worry about scammers? While sending very pure products they live off repeat buisness. I mean if you are experienced with Ketamine and then get ahold of some very pure product why wouldnt you go back to the same vendor? Same with MDMA I&#039;ve went through 3 vendors and I&#039;m sticking with the one which is beyond a shadow of a doubt pure and clean and dosed as advertised. I don&#039;t think LSD should be any different. I also ordered from Tess and have yet to try them just yet, but hopefully it I have better luck with Tess, and if he comes through for me, why would I look elsewhere? I really hope LD comes to the table to make this right with the people he has wronged (either intentionally or unintentionally) otherwise I think his sales will soon drop off...

I have used him twice and his MDMA (I can only speak for the pills not the powder) will make you question all other MDMA you have had before. I had previously tried some MDMA capsules from SR that I believed to be very pure and I had a great time, but that seller dropped off the site so I went elsewhere and found a lesser quality and continued looking and found xtcexpress, he is overseas, does not require FE, and has a great track record, if you are ordering bulk you get a bigger discount for each quantity you go up. I have heard people ordering quantities of 100+ being disappointed at the amount of broken pills that come in. I would personally stick with 50 or below. His pills are very recognizable and high quality pressed. I did try a small batch of the skulls (300-310mg), but I would prefer to get twice as many blackberries (150-160mg) because the skulls are not scored down the middle and they break off in a 60/40 split (by weight) personally 150mg is about where I like to be with one re-up as I&#039;m coming down. I have never seen anything close to that purity, even when previously taking what I believed to be 100% pure, in retrospect was far inferior. As long as he keeps doing good I will stick with him. There are not that many vendors that I would say are the go-to-guy but for MDMA XTCExpress is my only go-to-guy. With that being said, I have recently read reports about a lesser quality straight powder which makes me sad because I was considering straight powder as its cheaper and lets me tweak the dose to find the perfect one without doing crazy math (how much the pill weighs/how much is mdma/how much is binder/approximating dosage per weight etc) (IE maybe I would prefer 140mg with a 155mg re-up, I can&#039;t say for sure but 150 has provided the best experience)

				I think it is too early too tell if LucyDrop has truly fucked us over. He has been active in the forums and I believe he just said he is respoding to all of his messages(over 300 of them)and said he is going to try and make things right. This next week is going to be interesting for all those who ordered the bunk tabs.

				I just noticed the Avengers moved him to the &quot;Bad Vendors&quot; Section... But he stated in that thread : <br /><br />&quot;I am not in this to make money. I&#039;m trying to spread lucy. If i was looking to make a quick buck by taking a bunch of money and running, i could have done it numerous times in the past during the peak of my orders.<br />Clearly there is a problem with some people receiving weak tabs (not the majority), and i need to find a way to resolve it... please remember that i am not some rich guy with unlimited money... this whole thing has already cost me a ton of money and im still resolving with some people.. on top of answering hundreds of messages.<br />I ask for a little bit of patience please because this whole thing is starting to make me depressed and i have so much stress.<br />I will take care of everyone, and answer everybody... all i ask for is time to do both.<br />love&quot; <br />(Quoted from Lucydrop on the Avengers thread)

				The above post is why we don&#039;t just jump to screaming &quot;Fuck you&quot; at people! He has admitted there is a problem, and has asked we give him time to make it right. I don&#039;t expect him to make everything better overnight, but I do expect him to make amends, and I believe that he will. I think we owe him some patience as it looks like he is trying to come to the table and make this right.

				I had an issue like this with HardHustle (25i-NBOME) and half expected him to tell me to fuck off, then it turned out that his feedback crashed over the period of 3 days from people all saying the same thing &quot;Bunk hits&quot; they were all completely ineffective and only caused chest pain. I was a long time customer, but still expected him to tell me to fuck off, because in his vendor profile it stated &quot;no refunds for claims of weak tabs&quot; but he quickly realized that alot of these claims were coming from people like me (long time customers) many who had excellent feedback, then he came out and publicly admitted he had a bad batch and sent everyone affected new tabs and even threw in a bonus. Personally I find it much easier to politely bring an issue to a vendor, and in an issue like this give them the chance to respond before jumping all over them with hostility and negativity. Could you imagine if you made a mistake and had 300 people telling you to go fuck yourself? Probably wouldn&#039;t make you full of enthusiasm to jump right in there to fix the problem, might instead make you quit. That would end up hurting the community as a whole, tons of people screwed over, a seller who would rather just leave than make amends (and most likely just start another seller account), and then all those people bitter about the community doesn&#039;t exactly stimulate this economy. People think about the longevity of this community. We want to attract more quality vendors, the kind of vendors that if they make a mistake will come to the table and make things right, not just quit and start up a new account. It only takes a $500 DEPOSIT which you get back if you sell legit for a while. If people instantly bring hostility when mistakes are made it would make sense that it would increase the scams and encourage people to be more fraudulent with seller accounts because that would become the norm, after awhile everyone would just attribute that as one of the common aspects of this community. Personally I would like to see LD make amends for this mistake, then remove the FE requirement as a token of good faith, maybe that means he would have to slow down, but if he has more time to process each order, he would have more time to ensure the quality of each order...&nbsp;

				I&#039;m Pretty sure he will take care of those affected, we just need patience and I&#039;m sure it will all work out in the end. He seems like a great guy. I will continue to support him in the future once this has been made right. I just hope that he will remove the FE requirements at least on a 25 strip even if it has higher purchasing stats, or some kind of customer loyalty program for repeat purchasers.

				I am glad to see DefaultUserID can stay calm and give LD time to correct the mistakes. <br /><br />It&#039;s all the people who get so angry that cause an even bigger delay and they should learn to step back and wait a while before freaking out.

				I had no problems with Lucydrop. Great service and super clean LSD from the first few orders. The last one have not tried yet but I trust LD if I try them and they are not as advertised we will find a resolution.<br /><br />Otherwise LSD is NOT hard to find on SR...

				I&#039;m starting to get worried, personally. And unfortunately I decided to stock up for the summer and bought 50 tabs from them at almost $300. I ordered on Feb 11th and it was marked in transit on Feb 13th. It&#039;s now Feb 28th and nothing has come in the mail. LD has replied to each one of my messages within 24 hours, but I am still beginning to get very nervous. I would be very upset to lose a considerable amount of money and also not to have the acid. I will never FE early again no matter what, even if the tabs do arrive. What a fucking expensive lesson to learn.

				Yeah it seems to be happening more frequently or I just have bad luck. Each time everything has looked great and everyone raves about the vendor, so I put my money in and that it starts to get shady soon after. I always check the forum and check the feedback, but I keep getting in right before shit goes down. I&#039;ve been checking my mail every day without fail as soon as it comes, but things are looking pretty grim.
