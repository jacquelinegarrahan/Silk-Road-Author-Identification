				its too bad I can&#039;t sell one of my kidneys on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />sorry, just trying to get my post count up.&nbsp; and to participate.&nbsp; and why is there no longer an armory?&nbsp; I guess there could be many reasons why.<br /><br />Probably, I will initially purchase something like prozac or modafinil, just to familiarize myself with the process of communicating with vendors, getting bitcoin(s) ready, and placing an order.&nbsp; Or, maybe just a single dose of MDMA.

				You can buy some digital goods if you&#039;d like to get familiar with the process - up to you! eBooks or Goldenlotus&#039; coupons, something like that.<br /><br />There are some $10 samples of weed floating around too these days

Not a money maker by any means. It shouldn&#039;t make you &quot;trip&quot; being a dopamine and serotonin antagonist. If you were to ingest a psychedelic substance, theoretically it can &quot;abort&quot; a trip. I find it&#039;s a good &quot;shut you up&quot; drug. Seroquel will straight fuck your shit up. Try waking up off a couple hndred mg&#039;s of that shit...&nbsp; <br /><br />You can&#039;t sell organs due to US law. but I guess you could get a &quot;donation&quot;... Thanks Al Gore. <br /><br />I&#039;m a fuckin&#039; start meetakidney.com and you can pick out people and choose their organs. Like if you were racist and didn&#039;t want a nigger kidney or something.

				white kidney pow&#039;r!<br /><br />ha, imagine the logistics of that.&nbsp; The surgeon performing the operation, and then transporting the organ. lol.&nbsp; good to know you can actually sell prozac on here.&nbsp; I got a script of that, and I dont even pay for it, so it would be free money to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t imagine it sells for very much, I say that because its easy as hell to get a script for it.<br /><br />what exactly is a bridge?&nbsp; I&#039;m unfamiliar with the term.
