				Posting this thread here until I reach 50 posts, then I&#039;ll move it to off-topic.<br /><br />I’m going to cut right to the point here to save you time; I would like to enter a business venture with you. There’s one catch though, I have no money to bring to the table. This is why I’ve made this post, in the hopes perhaps you’d like to invest in my operation. Set your disposition and suspicion to the side for now…<br /><br />The plan is simple in theory, obtain roughly 500 GBP in order to set up a small 6-8 plant cannabis grow. Once harvested and sold, re-invest a large amount and expand the operation to about 15 plants. Complete several&nbsp; cycles with these 15 plants until roughly 6000 GBP is obtained; at this point hire a mini-digger, purchase a 20ft shipping container and fit it full of growing gear – I’ll leave you to guess the specifics.<br /><br />Within a few months time, we could be hitting 20k profits and more, I intend to reinvest this until I’ve got roughly 5 shipping containers continuously growing weed, it’s up to you whether you take your lump sum and leave or re-invest with me. Hypothetically, we could end up with 20 40ft storage containers in a secure complex underneath a legitimate cover business; But greed is not a wise way to go.<br /><br />I suppose it’d be right of me to explain why I can’t invest my own money, for several reasons I’m unwilling to get a job and would much prefer to seek out alternatives, this post being one of them. Of course, this sounds like an excellently terrible scam, and unfortunately there’d be little way I could reassure you otherwise on-line. Continue reading though, even just for amusement. <br /><br />First things first, I would much prefer to have just one investor to work with; This will minimize complications and risks, plus I’d feel much more safe only introducing one individual to the grow operation, rather than 10 people from around the country knowing where I’ll be growing weed. I am willing to accept multiple investments, but if this is the case I’d be suspicious towards showing you all where the money at.<br /><br />I have grow locations, both for the initial ‘wardrobe’ grow and the storage container grow. Both are secure and safe from theft, not least because there&#039;ll be a few protective dogs living there, but also because the grow room will be carefully constructed with stealth in mind. The initial location will be a flat rented from a trustworthy asian landlord who is a-ok with grow operations, he is happy with collecting rent (with a bit of profit) once we’ve completed a grow. The second location is some land owned in rural Wales (uk).<br /><br />There will be only a small handful of individuals involved in(and knowledgeable of) the operation; Myself, you, the landlord, and my friend through which the landlord was found. My friend is 46 years old, female and no bull-shit. We will have a face-to-face meeting before proceeding with the operation to get to know each other and build trust. If there are multiple investors, I will say only those investing more than 150 GBP will be aware of our identities and location of the grow OP, although I may change this standpoint.<br />&nbsp;<br />Finance wise, the plan is to re-pay you a set profit. If dealing with one individual, we will come to arrangement of how much profit you’ll like to be paid; Once this sum is reached, you can choose to either continue investing or take your money and walk. If dealing with multiple investors, the individual profit will be decided based upon the investment ratio, once I&#039;ve taken my share necessary for the next grow. You can choose to be re-paid through either cash, weed, or money laundered through an off-shore bank account. I would prefer long-term investors, as this would allow the operation to grow at an increased speed.<br /><br />If you are interested or have any questions post here or e-mail me<br />thelosthermit@tormail.org or thelosthermit@hushmail.com<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFFpaP8BCADreE1i1KUiUjTV9nmk2BXa3lGtcdXtWSzPOVoO5JFc24+5gSKn<br />zVl4M/EmckgIUOwM5v5otT/zToaYlQn9SzZAjzaNHi3bp6IYXQ5PaKRvwetVVNkk<br />JaZhRDf9afV9StFrptLhwstinCxGg1wOCaQgWvTTH83FW6UthCm8AKAXzpAJBvrD<br />f+EPrS+pknlsZLSjQivnFyMJMPI5jXw+xQp1/0/YuR+mV3m0OWqn+FmlkhR4I5r7<br />rCYGQDbDG0w3rrvOQfnGWK/KtP6YD8Z245Ac74HjlyRSqje1YdpqvMMcYqLtvm3H<br />CVMzsj3NkAWjOgb5wEE2XG8BlAu4Kn/aeW9zABEBAAG0LXRoZWxvc3RoZXJtaXQ3<br />NzcgPHRoZWxvc3RoZXJtaXRAaHVzaG1haWwuY29tPokBOAQTAQIAIgUCUWlo/wIb<br />DwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQ4dejynmWeVKOzwgAlsJ0k3SV<br />UgKdh8x4O99Sa6e+xMQgAfv6MLpB0u3yu06aNchTkrPy6FJvtL6fRzpq5lXkxW0m<br />aqYs+AErlCbwhOW6EdcEPbg0n8AZkhhDXhGaGMbjBrN8OD9ITccjxTbmkQxMOcLd<br />2vWYItqPCIj3t3uEaJJTn6jQZPg7yjmOuRd5z/UNYlJyPM0gnML46ZLBjtwOnzvG<br />L7g94aoZF4Hdb/qNU1Uv2eFZCTcoMYTI6jDMRWTZ9YLXzsjvmEWW4cKSQS7lB1VB<br />xinOJjHLNMIqKhnOU+aei94k0xB/TJvejfWeuug6WgxLc2y5d7YBbBOgf3O6PVrj<br />FwbQ6hnzjSyXNw==<br />=Zn0R<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />

				Hello, I think if someone does invest with you whether they seem trust worthy, or not that unless they plan on helping you on-site with the grow that it is none of their business where you actually locate your grow.&nbsp; &quot;plus I’d feel much more safe only introducing one individual to the grow operation, rather than 10 people from around the country knowing where I’ll be growing weed.&quot;&nbsp; I feel like that is too risky, and if you want to build up a rapport with them or vice versa then they can communicate with you via encrypted messages, or maybe burner phones or something, but it just seems like a police officer could offer you the 500gbp just to bust your grow later on.&nbsp; I know that sounds silly, or paranoid, but in the USA I would not put it past DEA to do so in a heart beat. Just my two cents.. I wish you well, and hope for the best! Love to sample the finished product!&nbsp; ;)

				I have no doubt it can be done, but it will take a lot more planning and £500 start-up capital isn&#039;t enough if your including running costs? Secondly this will all depend on your experience as a grower or if you&#039;ve got a grower. I know many people who have attempted this but ultimately failed due to experience in growing. If your looking to make a profit on your first grow your looking at it wrong.<br /><br />Food for thought; Maintenance/Running costs, Contingency funds, Growing experience, Target Yield, Buyers (you should have buyers lined up before you harvest, otherwise your going to have cash flow issues), Police activity and there&#039;s plenty more but no doubt if you plan it through it can be done.<br /><br />With a ounce of high-grade running at £230-£250/£7000 a kilo (London market), everyone&#039;s at it these days in the UK, but remember there are more applicants than successful professionals in this game. <br /><br />Good luck and if it all goes well make sure you start vending on SR I&#039;ll buy your whole harvest ;D

				The suggestion to Plan Plan Plan is correct. Might want to add - Think Think Think. To be successful in an underground career you have to be suited for it, just like being suited for any career. Make sure being quiet/secretive, tough (everyone wants to rip off in the underground), and able to withstand heavy exposure to addicting chemicals and circumstances matches your personality. U.S. jails and cemeteries are full of folks who had the same career aspirations but weren&#039;t really cut-out for the job.
