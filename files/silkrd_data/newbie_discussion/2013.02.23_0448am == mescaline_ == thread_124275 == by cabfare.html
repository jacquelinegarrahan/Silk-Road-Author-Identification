				i&#039;m sure plenty are aware that whether a substance is in freebase, hcl, acetate, hbr etc form&nbsp; can effect how quickly the drug is capable of passing through blood brain barrier<br />one example acetylated morphine (known by Bayer brand name Heroin)&nbsp; and how that has a large effect on speed crossing blood brain barrier making for quicker effects and higher potency (even though there is less morphine per weight, more gets to the brain)<br /><br />anyways i&#039;m trying to decide if i want acetate or citrate.&nbsp; i&#039;ve read some of erowid and also 69ron&#039;s posts on solubilities, and molecular weights etc of different forms&nbsp; &nbsp;but&nbsp; i haven&#039;t found anything about relative speed/efficacy <br /><br /><br />anyone tried different forms of extracted mescaline and noted differences. or have information from someone who has?<br />

				I can&#039;t exactly answer your question but i have used san pedro in the past, if your looking for a quick easy way to get a mescaline high you can make a mescaline tea, if you have more time you can do a isypropyl alchohol extraction or if your looking for crystals a standard a/b extraction will suffice, all of these forms are with a acid base because mescaline is soluble in a acidic base, make sure you use the right cactus worst thing is drinking down a pint of bitter tasting shit then realising you used the wrong kind, mescaline is a rarity which im still keen to try good luck :)

				already made tea before<br /><br />i actually don&#039;t have sufficient means to extract for pure mescaline<br />will prolly in spring though<br /><br /><br /><br />tea i used concentrated acetic acid (15%)&nbsp; before and had okay results,&nbsp; &nbsp;effects onset very quickly noticable in 20 min,&nbsp; significant visual abberation&nbsp; beginning at 50-80 minute range&nbsp; <br /><br />i think i may use citric acid this time&nbsp; and see weather i experience a difference.<br /><br />won&#039;t be prefect experiment<br />but.&nbsp; &nbsp;eh shit&nbsp; i&#039;mma go to bed&nbsp; &nbsp; starting to zone out. get back to this tmrw

				a Acid base extraction is suprisingly easy and you can extract pure mescalin crystals with relative ease, im not sure if this is the exact method (its the DMT method) but its very similiar<br />De-spine<br />cut into very thin stars(drys faster)<br />leave in sun(increases Mescaline content)<br />grind into powder<br />mix warm water with with 4(i think check for exact measurements somewhere else)<br />tablespoons of lye(NaOh, Costic soda you can find it in the supermarket)<br />make sure you wear goggles and gloves and add one tbsp at a time stiring then waiting till bubbles die down<br />leave to set then mix napatha,(Shellite in australia or any strong non-polarsolvent) into mason jar and agitate dont shake<br />leave to sit for around 1 to 3 minutes till there is a clear layer of napatha which you suck out with a turkey blaster<br />place napatha in pyrex dish in freezer for 3 days to freeze precipitate crystals, you will be left with yellow crystals<br />Chill disttiles watter and place crystals over papper or cheese cloth or some shit and pour over then leave to dry( some people use amonia, fuck that shit)<br />leave to dry and there you go, i may have gotten a few steps not right and measurements youll have to check to be completely sure but thats the general procedure im dying to try pure mescaline if i ever become a vendor, ill sell mescaline for a affordable price shame we dont see much of it as its probably the safest(after Psilocibin) Hallucinogenic drug and has been compared to a natural lsd+mdma
