				I thought this was an interesting article as well.&nbsp; Most alarming, it says law enforcement is using some kind of device that I&#039;ve never heard of that lets them know when a package or envelope has been opened (alas, there&#039;s also a picture of the poor lad being prosecuted):<br /><br />http://alaska-native-news.com/general-news/7664-juneau-man-sentenced-to-170-months-for-drug-conspiracy.html<br /><br />Juneau resident, Darrell W. Dawson was sentenced in Juneau to federal prison for drug conspiracy.<br /><br />U.S. District Court Judge Timothy M. Burgess sentenced 44-year-old Juneau resident Darrell W. Dawson, to 170 months in prison for his role in a drug trafficking conspiracy. There is no parole in the federal system.<br /><br />The sentencing stems from a case that was investigated jointly by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Postal Service and the Juneau Police Department.<br /><br />In July 2012, Darrell W. Dawson and Gema G. Thomas conspired to transport methamphetamine from the lower 48 to Juneau, Alaska.<br /><br />Thomas was the owner operator of Peer Amid Beads, Southeast Artworks, as well as a Gown and Tuxedo rental in downtown Juneau<br /><br />Prosecutors in the case said that Dawson paid G. Thomas $15,000 for a previous shipment of six ounces of Methamphetamine. Thomas made arraingments with a Washington state source to have another six ounces of meth shipped via USPS express mail to a Mendenhall PO box which she then picked up and took to her home and left in her unlocked garage for Dawson to retrieve.<br /><br />Dawson had an ongoing drug dealing relationship with Thomas, who fronted drugs to Dawson. <br /><br />But, unbeknownst to the two, the package had been intercepted by the post office, tested, and an electronic device was inserted into the package before a controlled delivery was made. The device alerted authorities when the package was opened in the garage of Thomas and investigators swooped in. Most of the drugs were removed from the package and Dawson was contacted to pick up the drugs. When confronted in Thomas&#039;s garage, Dawson attepted to flee but was apprehended.<br /><br />On July 20th, 2012, Dawson was arraigned on Drug Conspiracy to Distribute and Possession with Intent to Distribute charges in Juneau.<br /><br />In September, Dawson pled guilty to a charge of Conspiring to Distribute Methamphetamine.<br /><br />Thomas is scheduled to be sentence on March 8, 2013, for her role in the drug conspiracy.<br /><br />Prior to imposing sentence, Judge Burgess stated the serious of the offense, deterrence of the defendant and others, the protection of the public, and rehabilitation of the defendant related to his criminal history as reasons that supported the imposition of the above sentence.<br /><br />Dawson has a serious previous criminal history that includes Sexual Abuse of a Minor.

				I think eventually the mainstream mail might not be so viable anymore but hey, we&#039;re on the internet so the next step could just be a peer to peer delivery network.<br /><br />That said, I think we still have plenty of time left in this cat and mouse game.

				The defendants did almost everything wrong, frankly.&nbsp; Truthfully I think about all the cops succeeded in doing was giving us all recent confirmation that they&#039;re still doing things that way in at least some cases.&nbsp; If you&#039;re getting six fucking ounces mailed at a time, you have to do things differently.&nbsp; If you&#039;re seriously interested in how to mail those kinds of amounts, you better spend a LOT of time researching it.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably have a heart attack getting that kind of quantity shipped to me.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just buying personal amounts, ignore this story.&nbsp; It&#039;s virtually impossible anything even remotely similar will ever happen to you.

				Cheers for the rapid response. Maybe I have been a bit harsh. I shouldn&#039;t disrespect him really. I can understand why he feels neglected. We should all take it in turns.,with the manpower we have here, why leave it to a select few. Who obviously haven&#039;t grasped&nbsp; the gravity of their undertaking and had nothing but good intentions. You know what the pathway to hell is paved with don&#039;t you SS. 6 months. *looks incredulous* You certainly have gleaned a lot. My guess if I may, would be your some kind of professional person well educated, and probably got a few quid, Judging by some of your responses, you might well be a&nbsp; teacher, maybe philosophy&nbsp; &nbsp;;) Maybe your an ex con with form as long as your arm, That&#039;s the beauty of anonymity I guess! either way you&#039;re the epitome of a good community spirited comrade! The kind of person every roader needs.

Even though I&#039;m rather new to this. A few things strike me. 1. The Alaska meth guy was not using the anonymity of SR or Tor but real life connections, big mistake. There is nothing that protects you more than the near perfect anonymity of SR. 2. Another recent article about a couple being arrested was because he had it delivered to a PO Box, another huge mistake. There is no deniability if you pick up a package from your PO box. 3. The Beach Park guy did things correct and I would imagine his defense will hold up in court. The laws pertaining to mail are on the recipients side. It must be a real pain-in-the-ass for LE to get warrants and search mail. Too many jurisdictional issues and the overarching DEA and FBI don&#039;t have the manpower to waste on your three grams of weed.

				I ordered a couple DVD&#039;s from Howard HughesMedicalInstitute, had them sent to my PO box, and lo and behold, they were sent in a cardboard envelope,which had been opened on one end, and stapled back together, I would be wary of using USPS in many areas, seems the ones in my area are checking packages, not the first time I&#039;ve heard this.......I have also heard the UPS will check out a package also, but that FEDEX pretty much doesn&#039;t give a shit..........what do you guys think, USPS, UPS, or FEDEX, and why?<br />

Only feel for the victims of your crimes when your Iced up to death you animal. He is the only intelligent person I have come across. You would get robbed and slapped trying to score, so trolling me because I&#039;m not up2 speed with you&#039;re stimulants is pointless, and shows you&#039;re another gimp who would get hurt in the street drug game, so carry one&nbsp; giving out crap hiding behind you&#039;re screen, acting the big bollocks, and&nbsp; you will get a shock.

My god, do you even have a mirror in your house? Geek? &quot;LONG LIVE SCOUT!!&quot; LOL!! Sounds like theres a geek here all right, but it aint me. &quot;SS is the only intelligent person you&#039;ve come across&quot; because you havent come across anyone here. You just started junior.<br /><br />And lets get our facts straight because it seems you&#039;re behind the eight ball a bit. I didn&#039;t troll you, you trolled Nomad behind your computer screen, so dont try and twist it around. I wouldnt go to drug forum and call everyone who takes drugs &quot;animals&quot; either. If you come to this forum looking to &quot;kick up a hornets nest&quot; as you just admitted to, go off elsewhere, this forum has too many problems as it is.<br /><br />If you want some advice follow splint&#039;s lead, and just say thank you instead of berating them. No one has to kiss the mods&#039; asses. But don&#039;t call them plums either and say who&#039;s good and who&#039;s not when you registered 2 weeks ago and dont even know what meth is. Dont even think of showing your ignorant, ugly head in here again. Im sick of it. Sick to death of it.

				Meh I wouldn&#039;t want to be a moderator. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s fun at first but after a while having to deal with the same shit everyday for nothing but the gratitude of a few select members has to be nerve racking. Hosting an illegal drug trafficking forum certainly has its fair share of anti-authoritarians... if all they work for is the respect of it&#039;s members then give them as much as you can, even if you don&#039;t agree with their opinions. I&#039;m sure the alternative of having no moderators would be much worse.

				Latest controlled delivery story out of Wisconsin, 28 year old male becomes the target of a controlled delivery, and unfortunately for the old soul, accepts almost 3 lbs of cannabis, whereupon the unfortunate bloke (picture included) is nabbed by the sheriffs.&nbsp; Note that the detectives applied for and obtained a search warrant to be executed only upon acceptance of delivery.&nbsp; Well, brother has not been found guilty yet, and hopefully he didn&#039;t confess to the deed, but do you think the police would have called it a day and left him alone if he had said &quot;I don&#039;t know what that is and am not signing for that!&quot;?:<br /><br />http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/article/20130130/WDH0101/301300497/Package-intercept-leads-felony-drug-charges<br /><br />A Spencer man is facing more than 13 years in prison after a United States Postal Service inspector discovered a package filled with marijuana and alerted authorities before the drugs were delivered.<br /><br />Cody Wynn, 28, appeared in Marathon County Circuit Court on Wednesday on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and maintaining a drug trafficking place. Wynn was arrested Monday after investigators searched the apartment he shared with his fiancee, 27-year-old Heather Martens. Police said they discovered about 1,200 grams of marijuana in small packages and more than $7,000 in cash in the apartment.<br /><br />According to the criminal complaint:<br /><br />On Monday, an inspector with the U.S. Postal Service in Green Bay, who regularly conducts inspections on packages sent through the mail, contacted the Marathon County Sheriff’s Department after he discovered that a package addressed to Wynn contained a large amount of marijuana. The 13-pound package, which also contained blankets and other items, had a return address in Chester, Calif. Detectives with the Marathon County Sheriff’s Department immediately applied for and obtained a federal search warrant to be executed only in the event that Wynn accepted delivery of the package. It is not clear why the package addressed to Wynn was chosen for inspection.<br /><br />After delivery personnel from the U.S. Postal Service delivered the package to Wynn on Monday afternoon, investigators searched the apartment and discovered evidence of drug activity including marijuana, paraphernalia and cash. Official charges were filed against Wynn on Wednesday, and police said Martens is being referred to the Marathon County district attorney’s office for possible criminal charges related to the investigation.<br /><br />This is the second time in four months investigators have foiled the delivery of drugs after packages were intercepted prior to delivery. On Oct. 1, police seized more than $18,000 of marijuana and other drugs at a home in Wausau after a United Parcel Service supervisor discovered drugs in a package with an incorrect delivery address. Josiah Mays, 21, of Stevens Point; Joshua Geoffrey, 23, of Wausau; Mason Moody, 22, of Wausau; and Joseph Howe, 21, of Wausau, all face felony drug charges stemming from the October arrests. Their cases are pending in Marathon County Circuit Court.<br /><br />Wynn, who is originally from California, is being held in the Marathon County Jail on a $15,000 cash bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6.

				These cases all hinge around the fact that they didn&#039;t do what we know here as required for safety. The meth guy opened the box instead of waiting a few days. There&#039;s no way they were going to let that box sit around for a few days. And, the others had drugs in the house that served as the delivery point. If they had taken delivery, not opened the box, and had no drug evidence in the house, they might have a chance to beat it. Now, one of these guys has to take the weight for the others, or wait for one of them to tell. All I read here could&#039;ve been avoided, or they could have at least been smart enough to practice safe crime.
