				I wanted to post up on my very positive experiences with this vendor.&nbsp; Nod is in the process of establishing a very professional business for Cocaine and H.&nbsp; This review is for his C.&nbsp; The product is very good, the best that I have had yet here on my, admittedly, brief time on the Road.&nbsp; I have tried about 7 or 8 different vendors for Coke, ranging from I have no idea what that white powder was but it wasn&#039;t Cocaine, to what Nod sells.&nbsp; It is a delightful high, without much in the way of jitters, a little bit of bloody nose, but that could just be me, and a very, very mild come down.&nbsp; When he says it&#039;s off the brick without adulteration from him I believe him.&nbsp; I did some Cocaine back in the 80&#039;s and this Cocaine, from Nod, is the closest to what I remember having back then.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have made multiple purchases from Nod and he ships promptly with the package arriving within a couple of days (west coast) and very discreetly packaged.&nbsp; I will continue to order from Nod when I feel like getting a little C.&nbsp; Thanks Nod for being trustworthy and for shipping the real deal.<br /><br />TT

				&nbsp;:)&nbsp; What can anyon&nbsp; say about NOD this guy or girl is absolutely the best.. He has a 100% rating for a reason and thats because his customers come first.Trust me i had&nbsp; problem a while back my package arrived late&nbsp; 4 days late.(usps fault)&nbsp; and this guys sends me a half of a gram of xrta!&nbsp; WHo does these things!<br />Take time to read this.Dude if anyone has any lingering questions or fears about NOD Put them aside.This Man Woman is all freaking class.100 % i really wish you could leave feedback somewhere else like on the forum I will go into more detail there because i am pushing off now.I did a tiny bit and i am a long time 40 year old user of H.Delivery was so fast it was crazy! I think just around 34 hours more or less.<br />A++++ on delivery<br />Comm. Is always great he,she is very nice to speak with if you have a problem .I have had one problem with the shipping out of 4 buys and Nod was on it and sent me extra stuff &quot;alot&quot; just for my troubles.This is iinsane customer service.!<br />A++++++ better than good i had an order go late by a couple of days.(usps fault) and he said that he would make up for it on my next order and he did!.When i ordered With this order he sent me what looks like a freeking gram (he says .25 damn fibber! lol)of free Coke for having to waite .It damn well looks like any other vendors gram.another great customer service from NOD. he does what he promises no shit!If you want fotos ill do it if its ok with Sr NOD A+++<br />I mean who does that type of thing not any others ive seen on SR or at least very few.This guy,girl really know how to run a business.Thanks NoD you make my week all the time. I plan to use NOD all the time now .I tried others but they just dont compare to all you get with this guy,girl..He has a 100 rating for a reason and not just a 100 out of 20 deals.Check the stats these people are very good at what they do.take care M..

				Just going to add to all of the praise you guys Nod are giving. Placed an order for a G of the BTH with a sample of the coke. As far as communication he responded pretty quickly to the question I had. Shipping time was perfect when he marks it in transit you know he dropped it off/plans to that day. Stealth was pretty good def seen better but it got the job done!<br />As far as the product definetly some of the better of not best H I&#039;ve had the pleasure of doing. I smoke it left nice trails that you can resmoke and very little got you very high for along time. seemed to last longer than my usual H which was awesome. As far as the Coke goes definetly the best i&#039;ve ever had (I restrain from buying coke on the street because it&#039;s never flakey/rock and always shit. Came in one big .5 rock. Very Clean feeling and numbness, Very little needed to get high the half gram lasted 3 people 3-4 hours<br />WILL BE BACK FOR MORE

				I&#039;m pretty new to SR but one thing that I&#039;ve learned is that once you find a good vendor, STICK WITH THEM!.&nbsp; I&#039;ve placed a few orders for some BTH from Nod and loved the shit.&nbsp; After that I tried saving a few BTC&#039;s by going with some other guys and all I did was waste my time and BTC&#039;s on some mediocre product.&nbsp; Enough of that I&#039;m sticking with the best BTH on the Road; Nod.<br /><br />BTW I also got some of the free Coke with the express shipping and I&#039;ve yet to find anything else on SR worth doing.

				NODS customer service is just absolutly awesome . Unlike my spelling.<br />Whenever there is a problelm and i dont remember one except when the usps f....ed up HE STILL GAVE ME AN XTRA&nbsp; 1/2 of a gram for my 2 day wait.! How can you complain about that?<br />This guys goes way beyond and yes i have said his prices are high but for the service ,safety and the general&nbsp; attitude of which i recieve all the time is well worth it.Go to your local project and except the same and see if you dont get your money back or your ass handed to you .Hmmm ill stick with NOD any day thank you ..If its bad he makes up for it .IF something goes wrong and its his fault your good.Even when it wasnt he fixes things. you cant go wrong. All the nay sayers well go back to waiting or hopeing you will get your package but&nbsp; dont hold your breath..<br />This isnt to dog all vendors but few are off the caliber that is NOD.

				I&#039;ll add in my praise for this guy.&nbsp; Extra weight on the order, the coke was the best I&#039;ve had in years, and he&#039;s a professional guy.&nbsp; The shipping was fast....I believe it was two days to get to me.....that&#039;s his regular option, not express.&nbsp; The coke was VERY euphoric and I had a great time.&nbsp; If any new people are thinking of ordering some coke, Nod is a sure and safe bet.&nbsp; You will get what you expect and more.&nbsp; You will get it fast.&nbsp; You will have a great time.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only problem I had was trying to cut up more coke when I had already been going for quite a few hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to stay focused and actually chop well when you&#039;re having such a great time, lol.&nbsp; Maybe I should look into one of those homemade things a friend of mine had.&nbsp; It was criss crossed razor blades built into a fixture that he used to chop up rocks.<br /><br />Take care guys and gals.

				I have to send out anothe of these reviews because i had a problem about a week ago with NOD.Not NOD himself but the services that he is forced to use .IE&nbsp; &nbsp;USPS.Sometimes this service is pretty bad :-\ and but most times &quot;if they are not down they do a pretty good job. I get packages from him regularly from 2 to 3 days from door to door.. I love this guy( no homo) and nothing against homosexuals either.lol<br />So back to my problem,my package came about `5 to a week late which is unusual for NOD I was mad to say the least but i said very little.With NOD this seems like the best thing to do nd let him know and leave it at that.He will get back to you he is famouse for that.Ive talked&nbsp; with him many times real cool dude and when you order next you will get extra trust me.Its as if he is going out of his way to just help you! Its really good customer service lol.I will&nbsp; always be going back to NOD

				I&#039;ve never ordered from NOD but also have heard lots of good things (if one likes to spend money)<br />From what I&#039;ve heard, his heroin can&#039;t be beat.<br /><br />I however, recommend Purest.<br />He is the absolute best BTH dealer on SR for the price.<br />Last week I ordered a gram priority<br />He upgraded my package to Express for no reason.....<br />I got my shit next day.<br />Over weight.<br />I couln&#039;t even finnish it in a timely manner so i gave about 100 millagrams to a local junkie who is used to street dope.... he was able to inject the first 50 millagrams.... i had to shoot the second 50 for him AND I still took his cash while he had no idea where he was.&nbsp; :)

Thats how he tests out what he is going to buy&nbsp; so i dont know but NOD ships out so fast its sick!&nbsp; thats the truth my friends. I will give purest a test though.. take it slow brothers.peace.

				Has anyone else here tried ordering BTH from Purity (especially if you&#039;ve also ordered from Nod &amp; can therefore compare the two). <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m going to order BTH from Purity a bit later today, but I keep feeling like I&#039;m making a mistake by not going with Nod. <br /><br />Can anyone else weigh in?
