				So I was told of the deeper internet and the perks it had to offer (such as SR) by a friend whom I sometimes think i may have met just because the world wanted me to, I have talked to this friend once in person, and met them once in person. Now this person told me that years ago they found of this Silk Road and deep internet and that they would post to this forum about how they wanted to be Frank Lucas, or even bigger than Frank Lucas. How they wanted every cop to say where are these drugs coming from. Well I find myself here now doing the same thing. All I can say is I have the connections to get off over 50 pounds of weed a month potentially depending on the price I can be offered. I not only can do that but have connections to get off molly, K-Pins, and just about anything else you would like to introduce. I have stalked to a lot of vendors on the road about their prices on pounds and its not what my friend described to me. So what I am saying is I want to take it FURTHER THAN THE ROAD. I beleive there ties to larger groups like the mafia that are able to safely supply these kinds of amounts. All i can say is I&#039;m a damn good learner and im all ears when we are talking money. I&#039;m saying I have the connections to all the suppliers in my area and it is just business waiting to happen, all i ask is for a mentor to show me. I can read and read on this forum all i want but theres nothing better than hearing being coached from the man themselves. So if anyone would happen to know anything, I encourage you to message me here or via mail @<br />m6v1p7@tormail.org<br />And if anyone knows what exactly the DPR Book Club is I would love to get involved but as you can see I am too lazy to contribute 50 posts to no longer be a noob

				Hmm.. too lazy to make 50 posts and to use paragraphs, but you want someone to trust you with a task such as this?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see this happening.&nbsp; Also, this post is very sketch.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-X

				Not advertising myself as a scholar more of an entrepreneur with little respect for the way i format my writing on a black market forum. Its not that i am unintelligent, just ignorant with little patience. And you can take it how you want but the matter of the fact is that I am on a computer using this as a marketing tool, and that 50 pounds is a number that is and should be taken very seriously because what it comes down to is the massive money-flow that fifty plus pounds creates.

				I also want to learn all your deepest secrets, especially where you get your drugs and your shipping methods and connections. <br /><br />Please mentor me by emailing to FBI@tormail.org or my 100% legit safe email at info@usdoj.gov<br /><br />Thanks all!

				Ah, but here is a little bit of fun information to all: Interpol doesn&#039;t have any arrest powers, its just a big ol&#039; switchboard. Only in movies do they sweep in after our hero has managed to save the president of Russia from being assassinated and replaced by a lookalike (you get karma points for knowing what terrible movie I am referencing). <br /><br />No, in our sad world, the DEA is the international arm for fucking up our shit.

				That is some deep shit friend. We have gazed into the abyss and we find that we are the monster all along. <br /><br />You&#039;ve blown my mind. <br /><br />I am going to go buy some mescaline and go on a spiritual journey.

INTERPOL, WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY BUT WE BITCH ALLOT,&nbsp; FUCK YEAH!, they nick Hitman, &quot;CIA&quot; (I think) shows of their new Audies, Interpol gets jealous in shitty Range Rovers, stops to feel each other up, Interpol-guy &quot;We are transporting an international criminal blablalbla&quot; CIA-oldster &quot;No your not&quot; *swift oldster on you Interpol-guy*, Hitman gets: out of handcuffs, out of car, the Interpol SWAT Team to not see him, away although very: &quot;Where the fuck is I gonna go now?!&quot; surroundings, Interpol gets sad, *TIME TRAVEL*, Hitman &quot;Are you a good man?&quot;, Interpol-guy &quot;You really think I gonna say No?&quot;, Hitman looks like an egg, Interpol-guy &quot;Yes of course I´m a good man! So I said it, pleas leave so I can take care of the fucking corps you dumped on my office floor?&quot;, Hitman leaves still doing egg imitations... The End!<br /><br /><br />Did I miss something?<br /><br />Well I know one thing, I will not waste any time of my increasingly shorter lifespan on: the Saint, babysitting, picking up dog-poo, Bangkok, crack, train my future daughter in the fine art of A.T.M., pole vaulting, the Bee-nax challenge (every time you finished a Beer you have to drop a xanax bar... well let´s just say that after beer number 5... or 6 you start &quot;malfunctioning&quot;, and you always wake up in 1 of 3 places: at home, in jail, underneath some fat-girl´s fucking lead-heavy blubber-arm so either you take of your glasses and becomes Superman and no one will know it´s you, or you admit defeat because of fat-girl-kryptonite-poisoning and spend the time, until she will free you, praying that all the nasty stuff took place last night and that you don´t have to repeat them), re-installing my Office package, support women rights, trying to find out why my brother have 2 girlfriends which where girlfriends already and they are movie actresses..................... yes, those kinda movies, making women in high heels stomp on my balls, becoming a hairdresser, sniffing glue, convincing people I´m invisible, eating bananas without peeling them, train my future son in the fine art of A.T.M., Facebook, try to shake hands with Mr Hands, covering The Pentagon in post-it notes, Justin Bieber, running the marathon, watching: the marathon, tour de france, Italian football, Teletubbies, commercials of any kind, Pedro or what´s his name the guy that wont stop &quot;shushing&quot; dogs even when they´r quiet as fuck, or any other retarded, food related, news, religion, knitting, contemporary art, improv, mimes, fatties, medical, Disney, chess, dancing, non-violent porn, finger painting, boring sports (men know which), sitcoms where old people play young, fashion, crab fishing, MTV or any other fucking shitty-asshole-fuck-tard-ball-sucking-cunt-kicking-game-show ther´s on TV at any given time&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
