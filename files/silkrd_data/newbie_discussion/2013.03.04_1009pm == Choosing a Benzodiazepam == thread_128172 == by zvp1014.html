				So I might be placed on legal benzos for my anxiety in the near future, so I&#039;m curiousâ€“<br /><br />What&#039;s the best benzo? I&#039;m mostly concerned about how good they work and whether or not they have diminishing returns (needing hire and hire doses).

				Depends what you are looking for I guess. I&#039;m not big on benzos myself, only ever took valium and etizolam (and etizolam isn&#039;t technically even a benzodiazepine). For anxiety I&#039;ve never heard anyone say that valium doesn&#039;t do the job. You will develop a tolerance, but I think the tolerance only really spirals out of control when you are taking it recreationally. People get prescribed the same dosage of it for a long time, so I think when it is small amounts taken as advised it isn&#039;t that big a factor.<br /><br />Valium is great fun unless alcohol is involved. The few times I&#039;ve been sober and took a few blues I just feel ultra relaxed and worried free (perhaps a little mentally numb, but not in a bad way). When I take it drunk I just turn into a junkified spastic and blackout.<br /><br />Etizolam just knocks me out. When I take it I take it it&#039;s like I&#039;ll be sitting up typing, then I&#039;ll feel a kinda benzo feeling coming on, then I&#039;ll just wake up the next morning, lying down on my couch with no memory of even lying down. I&#039;ve always been on my own when I&#039;ve taken it, so I don&#039;t even know what happens. Either I just suddenly pass out, or I get really fucked off of it and just don&#039;t remember. I don&#039;t like it.

				Fortunately I&#039;m not a huge fan of alcohol. I&#039;ve always thought of Valium as being one of the big abused drugs amongst celebs- did you find it very addictive?

				Klonapin and Clonezapam are very nice for anxiety. They even make you a bit social and outgoing. To much and you&#039;ll fall asleep. 1 - 2mg is a nice dose per day. I would be careful to not take too much because they are addictive and will stop being beneficial if you develope a tolerance (could cause anxiety / social issues / anger)

				Forgot to add that you should use Benzos as needed and not at a routine time everyday. They kick in pretty quick, about 15-30 mins.

That&#039;s not because it isn&#039;t addictive though, it definitely is and I know people who have had very bad times with valium, just hasn&#039;t been a problem for me personally. I&#039;m too busy having a problem with alcohol lol&nbsp; ;D

				i would recomend ativan (lorazepam) 0.5-2.0mg or valium (diazepam) 2.5-10mg for acute anxiety management i.e. &quot;panic attacks.&quot; Klonopin (clonazepam) is used for long term therapy for treatment of persistent anxiety from drug and alcohol withdrawl and in pulmonary patients who suffer from anxiety due to hypoxia (low oxygen). <br />the idea with long acting benzo&#039;s like librium and clonazepam is: you take a specific dose twice daily until desired effect and then maintain that dose. you must taper off&nbsp; when discontinuing after long term use. they have long half lifes. be careful not to take too much! start with 0.25 to 0.5mg clonazepam initially. it does have a strong amnesia effect with me...especially with tequila, coke, bud, and beer! so i must admit it is one of my favorites for i resort weekend when i am not driving ;)<br /><br />KYmatt

				Temazepam is my favourite, though a good batch of REAL orange C10s goes soooo well with a glass of wine!

				You&#039;ll most likely be prescribed ativan, don&#039;t tell the dx that you have a preference (unless you have been previously prescribed) unless you want to be tagged with drug seeking behavior or previous drug usage.&nbsp; I have severe anxiety and had to self medicate because I told my dx what med worked best for my anxiety, and it came across as drug seeking behavior

				I had a bad experience with xanax and alchol. It actually didn&#039;t hurt me or get me in trouble but it easily could have. I took half a bar and I remember drinking about half a beer then I woke up 6 hours later on the side of the road 45 miles from where I started $3400 poorer and didn&#039;t remember a thing. I figured it out the next time I went to my fav titty bar and the girls all came a running. lol. 3400 in a high end strip club and don&#039;t remember a damn thing. <br /><br />I think the worst part about it is that that is the first and only time I have ever blacked out on anything. It scared the shit out of me.

				I think they are right when they said you probably dont have a choice, choosing your flavour with your doctor<br />just screams Dr Shopper. In saying that:<br />Valium, good old favourite cant go wrong, nice warm comfortable feeling without drowsyness<br />Ativan second favourite, once again not too drowsy with all the goodness<br />Mogadon not bad but doesnt compete<br />Temezapam and Midazolam good for sleeping<br />Xanax, really think this one is the most overrated<br /><br />BUT DO NOT ABUBSE BENZOS!! You will ruin your ability to get high ever again,<br />After about 2 years of daily 50mg Valium I can no longer feel anything of Benzos, I have tried<br />taking 100mg Valium with 50mg of Ativan and feel absolutely nothing, its devastating,<br />Im 3 months of not trying anymore aiming for 1 year and hoping tolerance will be gone<br /><br />But i wouldnt order off SR, this place is ridiculously overpriced
