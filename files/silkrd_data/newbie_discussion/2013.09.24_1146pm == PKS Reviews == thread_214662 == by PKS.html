				INDEX (#INDEX)<br />1. Welcome message &amp; How-to guide for using my reviews thread. (#WELCOME)<br />2. Explanation of my reviews, the ratings, and what it all means (#BUTWHATDOESITALLMEANBASIL)<br />3. Product Reviews (#PRODUCTS)<br />4. Contacting Me (#CONTACT)<br /><br /><br />Welcome to my review thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;#WELCOME<br /><br />I will be reviewing anything I order on the SR here, using a couple of categories.&nbsp; <br /><br />Safe Assumptions:<br />-Anything I&#039;m reviewing, I&#039;ve tested.<br />-I did not FE for any of these orders, ever.&nbsp; <br />-I will never be purchasing Cocaine or Marijuana through the Road.<br />-I do not review shipping times.&nbsp; Not only are there too many factors out of a vendor&#039;s control, but I order my drugs long before I need them.&nbsp; If you know you want drugs, and you have access to the SR, then you should be able to obtain them well in advance.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t plan that far ahead, maybe you should rethink casual drug use.<br /><br />How to use this review thread:&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ll be making use of hashtags (#) for tagging parts of my review thread.&nbsp; Each product will have it&#039;s own header (#MDMA, #LSD, etc) and you can find a list at the top of the products section.<br />Additionally, you can see what sections are called at the top.<br /><br />Explanation of my reviews: #BUTWHATDOESITALLMEANBASIL<br /><br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Poor<br />**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below average<br />***&nbsp; &nbsp; Average (or, what I&#039;ve come to expect from SR.&nbsp; Usually this is above street average)<br />****&nbsp; &nbsp;Above average.&nbsp; <br />***** Amazing.&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; Buy now!<br /><br />Price: How does the price compare to other vendors.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be comparing to local prices, strictly to other vendors on the Road.<br />Quality: Was the drug what I was expecting to receive in the amount advertised?&nbsp; <br />Stealth: How good was the packaging? <br />Bonus: I&#039;ll something add (or remove) a * for whatever reason.&nbsp; Usually customer service.<br /><br />Format for Reviews <br /><br />PRODUCT<br />Vendor, Quantity, Pertinent review information.<br />Price: *** Notes<br />Quality: *** Notes<br />Stealth: *** Notes<br />Bonus: *** Notes<br /><br /><br />And now, without further ado, onto the product reviews. <br /><br />#Products <br />#MDMA <br />#LSD<br />#DMT<br />#4ACODMT <br />#2CB (I&#039;ve seen it referred to as &#039;Nexus&#039; a couple of times)<br />#2CE<br />#5MEODIPT (AKA Foxy, or Foxy Methoxy)<br />#VIAGRA<br />#KETAMINE<br /><br /><br />#MDMA<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2c851dc401]MaidMandy[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/fc762d7f20]1 gram High Quality Dutch MDMA[/url]<br />I&#039;ve ordered this a few times.&nbsp; Absolutely some of the best MDMA I&#039;ve had, on- or offline.&nbsp; Offwhite, huge crystals, felt amazing.&nbsp; <br />Ships out of Ireland, which gets examined less by customers if that matters where you live.&nbsp; Also, she has exceptional customer service. <br />However, she&#039;s more expensive than most MDMA vendors.&nbsp; If you go through a lot of product, or are poor, she might not be for you.<br /><br />Price: **<br />Quality: ****<br />Stealth: ***<br />Bonus: * (customer service)<br /></code><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d331e1b87f]TheHeineken[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/72db207f57]1G&#039;s MDMA Crystal[/url]<br />Recently had a chance to sample his wares that a friend ordered.&nbsp; <br />The crystals were slightly tan in colour, but crushed the powder was closer to the usual off-white you see in MDMA.&nbsp; <br />Good product, a standard quality MDMA that you can get from the road.&nbsp; He will ship a variety of volumes, and has many other wares.&nbsp; <br />300+ Ratings with an average of 5.0, this is a vendor you can trust.&nbsp; However, he will not ship to the USA.&nbsp; Sorry Americafriends.<br /><br />Price: ***<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: [pending my own order]<br /></code><br />#LSD<br />Before I review any of this stuff, you should probably consider checking out &nbsp;The Averngers LSD Vendors Review Thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0).&nbsp; They&#039;ve been reviewing a lot longer than I have, and I went to them when I first started buying the stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5ee411ef21]Haizenberg[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e86da45bcd]Haizenberg Hoffman HQ LSD 100UG x25 blotters[/url]<br />Standard Hoffman blotter.&nbsp; Upon sampling, I would say that these are at least 100ug, probably slightly over - first time I&#039;ve experienced ego death on a single tab.&nbsp; <br />Very good product, and among the lower price points I&#039;ve seen for a 25 LSD order.&nbsp; He will probably become my go-to for LSD.<br /><br />Price: ****<br />Quality: ****<br />Stealth: ***<br /></code><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/93af9ae133]Tessellated[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b26085cd57]10 hits of POTENT and CLEAN LSD - White label[/url]<br />Advertised at 200ug, these tabs are a significant dose higher than most of what you get on the road, and you can tell.&nbsp; <br />A lot more intense than the usual LSD I get, these are for special occasions.&nbsp; Tessellated ships out of Canada for those looking for something local in the north.&nbsp; <br />However, given that he&#039;s in Canada and he&#039;s selling higher than average doses, he also raises his prices. <br />I would say they&#039;re fair for the actual amount of LSD, but generally when people buy, they&#039;re buying per &#039;trip&#039;, not per microgram. <br />&nbsp;So I would say he&#039;s slightly more expensive than average.&nbsp; However, his stealth is amazing.&nbsp; You can almost always find rave reviews of his stealth on his feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />Other vendors: Take heed, this is how it&#039;s done.<br /><br />Price: **<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ****<br /></code><br /><br />#DMT<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cdc40792f6]RingoDeathstarr[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a0381577b3]1g DMT Freebase[/a]<br />Pretty basic DMT order.&nbsp; Got what I wanted, in a timely fashion, at a solid price.&nbsp; <br />Worth noting that this is another vendor with exceptional stealth.<br />Price: ***<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ****<br /></code><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c454ea9fd9]Asylum[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/17c3b3b83e]1g Changa[/url]<br />For those who don&#039;t know, Changa is a blend of herbs with DMT in the mix.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s smokeable out of a pipe, bong, whatever - the herbs absorb the impact of the immediate fire, so you don&#039;t need to vaporize the DMT. <br />&nbsp;This was how I first smoked it, and I daresay it works.&nbsp; You need about 2x as much Changa as you need DMT for a &#039;breakthrough&#039; experience. <br />&nbsp;Smoking changa is also a lot easier on the lungs than smoking DMT directly, if you do insist on trying to smoke DMT with a vape.&nbsp; <br />Price: ***<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ***<br /></code><br />#Ketamine (K?&nbsp; K is for horses.)<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b54698f8da]MarijuanaIsMyMuse[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b19f1099dc]1.0g Premium S-Isomer Ketamine - Reagent Tested[/url]<br />Another Canadian vendor, MIMM has been around for well over a year now.&nbsp; Well, insofar as ketamine goes, MIMM was professional, friendly, and quick. <br />A huge selection of products, this is a vendor that&#039;s been growing their customer base for a long time.<br /><br />Price: ***<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ***<br /></code><br />4-AcO-DMT (#4acodmt)<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/64a70cf0f0]PuffyDaddy[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/fd27c0b7b7]5 Gel-Tabs 4-AcO-DMT x 10mg[/url]<br />Not much to say.&nbsp; Good product, good stealth.&nbsp; Definitely a bit on the expensive side - but the vendor is packaging up individual doses for you. <br />&nbsp;You&#039;re not paying as much for the product as you are for the presentation.&nbsp; <br />If you don&#039;t have a proper scale (+/- 0.001mg), then this is a great resource for drugs.&nbsp; If you do have a proper scale, I would just order the powder.<br /><br />Price: **<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ***<br /></code><br />#Viagra<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/93e8dfc3c3]Angelina[/url]<br />[url=http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/159b3a7d8d]Generic Viagra - Sildenafil Citrate - 12 x 100mg[/url]<br />Angelina provides her product quickly, stealthily, and it&#039;s the right product.&nbsp; <br />For those of you who enjoy a recreational dose of it (or are too scared to visit the doctor) give her a shot.&nbsp; Also has quite good customer service.<br /><br />Price: ***<br />Quality: ***<br />Stealth: ***<br />Bonus: * (customer service)<br /></code><br />Contact Me (#CONTACT)<br />I&#039;ll update this with a public PGP key shortly.&nbsp; In the meantime, if anyone wants to contact me for any reason, please message me on these forums, and include a PGP key I can use to contact you private.&nbsp; If I can&#039;t talk with you encrypted, I wont talk to you.
