				cyanspore is a great vendor with some serious shrooms, but there are lots of great shroom vendors here on the road. DReaMensioN has psilocybe azurescens which are sitting in a drawer in my kitchen right now. Haven&#039;t tried them yet, but he is a great vendor also. BreezeTheGnome and Lynx Industries I can also vouch for. Just get yourself into the shrooms section (Psychedelics&gt;Shrooms) and browse around. There&#039;s only like 3 pages of listings so you could go through everything that&#039;s available on the road in quicktime, and new listings pop up all the time.<br /><br />:)

				last time i tripped i had chocolate peanutballs not a clue to what was in them, my girlfriend had a freak out on the comeup, i was fine had a really nice body high a few visuals here and there. at one point me and my bestfriend swore we were talking through our minds?&nbsp; i ordered the galindios because they claim not to cause the freak out but can still have some cuisines effects when taking more dosage. Hoping to have an awesome experience at the beach with 5 of my friends, 1 who has never tripped.
