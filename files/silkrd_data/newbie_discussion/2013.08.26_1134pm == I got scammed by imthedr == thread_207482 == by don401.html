				Hey guys. In a little bit of a situation here. I recently made 2 purchases from imthedr. I will be as detailed as possible. I need help from a mod to look at my account history and see that he never refunded me the rest of the BTC I was due.<br /><br />First order was made on the 12th. Said he shipped it but never did, refused to provide tracking. Then yesterday he finally issued a full refund for this purchase.<br /><br />Second order was made a few days later (we were negotiating, first order was a sample but I figured I could trust him), it was a larger order, just over 15 BTC. <br /><br />On this order (2nd one, the one I am having issues with), after we made the order for 60pcs, I needed to change it to 40pcs. So then he told me that I have to finalize early. So I did, but I did not leave feedback. So he proceeds to issue 2 refunds (one that same day, and one 3 days later, but the refunds ONLY totaled 5.06 BTC!).<br /><br />My order was 10BTC more than that! So now we have been talking back and forth, and he comes to this conclusion:<br /><br />&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refunded $, then shipped that&#039;s the policy I CANNOT do anything else its clearly marked on our profile! I already lost 5k with these packages I cant afford anymore losses! My partners would literally kill me. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;imthedr 3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Silk Road Support, please dont contact me anymore. Too much cursing and just being rude when I clearly stated our refund policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 seconds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />imthedr 3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. Please contact support. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 minute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete&quot;<br /><br />This is unreal. He REFUSES TO refund me the rest!! <br /><br />HE CURRENTLY STILL OWES 10.63 BTC. I NEVER GOT A SINGLE SHIPMENT. NOW, HIS POLICY STATES THIS:<br /><br />He says recently he had some issues with an arrest and will be refunding ALL unshipped or undelivered orders. So that means I qualify yes? BUT, he only refunded my SMALL order. He refuses to refund the whole purchase! Not cool and not my fault. He is complaining that he lost 5,000$ already, even though he just stole over 1,000$ of that from me!<br /><br />Please, can anyone help at all? I really hope there is something that can be done.. Vendors like this should be booted. I know what its like to sell and experience issues, but we, the SELLERS, have to take the loss, unless something else can be negotiated. He does not even care about me.<br /><br />Here is what his page says:<br /><br />&quot;BULK REPLY: I really can&#039;t answer all these messages. 45 just from today. I am doing my best, I completely refunded ALL orders and I moved to another city so I will be handling shipping myself but we have had to make a few changes...<br /><br />We have been having shipping errors. We are updating our profile now, we will now only ship twice a week (Monday and Thursday). We will only be using USPS Priority (non express!), so packages can take up to 7 days. We will only be offering listing with 10+ pills, we simply cannot offering singles. If you NEED a single listing we can offer them for $40 ea but VERY limited quantity please PM for listing link. Please DO NOT EVER FE, EVER. The only time you will need to do this is if your order doesn&#039;t show up and you opt for a re-ship instead of a 100% refund, which is clearly stated on our profile that we offer 1 free re-ship or a 100% refund. Case by case but because of all the problems I am giving EVERYONE all of there money back. I am sorry for the delays that were caused, 2 arrests of my drivers pretty much clogged my schedule. If you get your sample (or Roxi, etc... again, bulk reply) then its a gift. We are re-doing our listings now and will be back up in the AM. We cannot check this many messages a day, PLEASE check our profile for our TorChat. If didn&#039;t answer you question I apologize please TorChat or PM and I will reply as soon as I can. Thank you I appreciate the communities considered support..&quot;<br /><br />He says he will never ask for FE? Why did he ask me RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT ARRESTED THEN? Also he claims that he will do 1 free re-ship OR a 100% refund. I have got none of those. This is screwed up. Please, someone help?<br /><br />Thanks and please let me know if I can be more detailed.

				Also guys, I can use my account history to prove that I am missing 10.63 BTC. Would that help at all? Is there any mods or anyone in specific I might able to explain the situation to and be helped out? I know I should not have FE&#039;d guys, so please don&#039;t flame for that. He seemed trustworthy.. <br /><br />Thanks

				As detailed as it is, as soon as you finalized early, that was the end. The Buyer&#039;s Guide says it, it&#039;s all over the forums about the dangers of finalizing early. If you are about to say &quot;yes, but...&quot;, just the first word applies. ;)<br /><br />Your options now are limited to working it out with the vendor (looks like he is done working with you), leaving a thread on his vendor discussion page and posting to warn others here. You can report the vendor detailing your story if you want, see what they say about it...maybe it will cause them to keep an eye on the vendor but finalizing early cuts the resolution center completely out of your options. <br /><br />The mods over here won&#039;t be able to help you at all, either. SR and the forums are two different entities and the mods over here have no tools for dealing with SR. That&#039;s why you have to go through SR support over there.&nbsp;

				What you are doing right now seems to be sufficient (for anyone that checks the forums).&nbsp; That&#039;s a tough loss, especially because the vendor is essentially just stealing your money.&nbsp; You are handling it much better then I would don401!&nbsp; Very mature. <br /><br />Hope you and the vendor come to a resolution.&nbsp; Always better then an ugly, drawn out feud.&nbsp;
