				Okay this might sound stupid but here goes. My question is, when it comes to my address, should I give my P.O. Box Number or my home address? I don&#039;t have a home mailbox. I guess I want to know if the package will be sent/put in my P.O. Box or is it going to be something that is delivered to me. Someone please answer this fast as I am itching to try some products on SR/ Thanks

				I don&#039;t have a PO box, but if I were you I would ask the vendor. Possibly even place the order and enter both options...

				So is it like an actual package that will be delivered by someone or is it like regular mail that can be put in a P.O. Box? If I get it set to my P.O. Box are the workers even going to put it in my box or am I going to have to talk to one of the workers to get it? I just want to know that if I get it sent to my home address that it will arrive since I don&#039;t have an actual mailbox. Lol I&#039;m over-thinking this way too much but I don&#039;t want to make any mistakes and not recieve my product.

				It depends on what your ordering dude, it its a kilo, it will not be a letter. Safe bet says send it where ever it is you get your every day mail, letter from granny etc.
