				I moved into the Uk for a fresh start. After many years of using H I needed this. So I cleaned up and stayed like that for a couple years and then SR comes along.<br />I love my gear, but H really fucks up your life if you let it control you which, lets face it, happens all the time.<br /><br />So how is SR good for me?<br />Well, Im middle aged, no way Im going back on the street looking for gear, waiting, getting robbed, and most important getting sick after continuous use. SR enables me to put some kind of control om my use. I buy half gram for the weekend and thats it. Even if I want more, we always want more, I have to wait to buy bitcoins, get online, no orders on weekend blah blah so It just turns me off. I change chips and wait for next opportunity to buy.<br /><br />So I never get sick and I enjoy my gear.<br />Thank you SR.<br />

				My addiction is coke and I do agree SR provides me with the exact same &quot;solution&quot; <br />I know H is much more addictive (haven&#039;t tried though and I probably shouldn&#039;t till I am 70 and half dead) but still I am<br />hooked pretty bad on coke - but the street gear we can get here is so fucking bad and the risk is crazy.<br /><br />long time ago, the last time we tried local blow - I mean it was ridiculously bad, the high was OK but it took me 12-14 hours to get down - so that was definitely mixed<br />with something crappy - now I only use SR and buy limited every time and the blow we get is so clean that it brings me back to the 80&#039;s when we could get excellent quality on the streets.<br /><br />I got a supply last weekend and an old friend wanted a gram - he was over the top he hadn&#039;t had blow for years cuz of the quality here, this was so pure and the high is perfect - an hour you are down <br />and no jitters nothing - but as you say then you just want more and more so SR limits that, see money is not the issue anymore as it was when I was 17-18 and that is a danger with my craving.

We have the buying power, we r not going on the street, we dont need no hassle from shady characters and we r not to be bothered with too much work to get our gear.<br /><br />Its a perfect match.

				Yes, I can agree that it does keep the addiction rate down. It takes a few days so unless you are a bunch of cash and order all the time there is no way to create a habit.

Im lucky there are a few good vendors here. Having said that I have FEd a couple of times for trusted vendors and had no problems. Remember these guys need to protect their reputations, its all they got to keep in business, so find one with 98 or more and fe him on a small order.<br />good luck.

				Until now I have only got one order through, that was from FM. Thing is a couple days later i made another order from him, and that one is taking too long (12 days, vs 5 days the other one) so now we&#039;re are trying to fix that one, I know it can be a pita for him, since I too only order 0.5s<br /><br />So now since the Xchange is back, and said he would re send his missing orders for free! (We had all gotten refunds already) I may give him a second try, hoping to get that order and see how it goes. I&#039;ve seen there are a couple sellers looking good but who only ship uk domestic. I&#039;d rather order domestic too but there&#039;s not a single H seller from my country.<br /><br />Anyway there are quite a lot of other goodies I&#039;m getting so, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m unhappy, at all!! :)

				I find that before SR I would chase my high on the streets every weekend, always getting teased by weak substances. But now that SR has came along I can do 1 big binge a year &amp; be satisfied. Leaving me to be a more productive member of my society 95% of the year. Also I don&#039;t have to put all my minds effort into sourcing, arranging a pick up, the nervousness of meeting with people who will gladly give you shit product, is it going to be good is it going to be bad....of course it&#039;s going to be bad, your on the streets! &amp; then SR came along. Life saver!<br />Peace.&nbsp; :D

				Looks like TheXchange is back in business, just got some and it rocks. My favorite vendor, topnotch is still nowhere to be seen which is a pity, I loved this guy lightspeed delivery. but now i have to wait 3,4 days domestic to arrive ( I dont get it, vendors, why mark in transit if its not?? ).<br /><br />But on the topic, this wait is kind of good, you know... keep the hungry monster under control.

				i enjoy the quality of the H here only prob it seems is finding a vendor that sticks around or stays in supply as it sucks wondering what kinda of stealth ,speed,quality ect are to happen with the new guys i end up having to go with. (i try and look for good deals) for instance i thought i found my vendor in Heavenly Black now he dissapeared&nbsp; . Saws gone . subs is always out in 10 hours FF is good but high in price like many of the other full time vendors although i have been lucky i still get a knot in my stomach as my mail man walks around the neighborhood with a package not knowing it&#039;s new vendors methods. other than that what more can i ask for this is the future . no more worring about the other things you listed above or getting beat up ect.

				weed is my poison been a toker since 88, I also fit the demographic of 40 something bored of getting ripped off or buying poor quality etc.<br /><br />before sr came along for me I had 1 guy who I trusted, we went way back, school days. but his weed came wth cropping cycles, every few months he would have a bulk batch of weed and I found myself having to buy 3 ounces on drip and hoping this lasted until his next crop, sometimes it came up short and i would have go go on the street, I hated it and hated the people I would wind up buying off.<br /><br /><br />the anxiety drove me to a point where I needed to know I had weed or life was intolerable.&nbsp; now I know I can get good weed within a few days delivered to my door so my consumption has dropped dramatically.&nbsp; now I buy a gram every few weeks for the weekend and really enjoy my skoke rathr than being a slave to it.<br /><br />thank you DPR and everyone else who makes this possible,&nbsp; we are on the cutting edge here.

				I agree wholeheartedly that whilst inconvenient its probably better in the long run.&nbsp; I find that you dont have to worry so much about quality, as even with a regular local dealer if he has been given shite he is gonna need to pass it on... And reviews on here are better than word of mouth as realistically how many customers do you know of your dealer.<br /><br />I suppose as well from a vendors point of view they know people can complain easier &#039;over the net&#039; than face to face, so if not asking for FE they need to ensure their product is good.

				Where I live I am somewhat lucky (or unlucky) to have an area nearby where H is literally everywhere. Pretty decent quality too since I live in a port city. The Road has had an opposite effect on me. I am able to try new things, keep my mind off the H, and keep going. I&#039;ve lost so many close to me to death or prison, that I am so excited to be a part of this community where I can use alternatives, and not have to worry about robbing my own family or friends because getting H was just that easy.
