				Yeah, it was pretty awesome when I got my first package. Was starting to think it wasn&#039;t going to show, as it had been about a month since I ordered, but then a dvd case turned up... Six months later and this has literally completely changed my life.

Getting drugs in the mail through a website you&#039;ve never used before from a stranger you&#039;ll most likely never meet, is a pretty reasonable thing to stress over. Some times things are scary, even if you know they&#039;re okay. Also international shipping still freaks me out some times.

				I remember my first online drug transaction.<br /><br />Communicating PGP through email, vendor feedback on safeorscam (anyone remember that site? lol), going to western union to pay, and finally seeing that beautiful letter after a several weeks.<br /><br />Good times.

				Maybe your right about the international orders. I wouldn&#039;t know. Also if your worried that is one reason the forums were made.&nbsp; ::) Locally I haven&#039;t bought weed locally since I don&#039;t know lol.. Seeds in my weed haha I actually ordered from a vendor here and the page says AAA Top Shelf Medical Grade! I&quot;m not going to give out their name but the weed has seeds and meds my ass. I am not sure if I could even call it mids. I&#039;m never worried about getting the package. Its the quality that worries me. Every single fucking time. Do your research.&nbsp; :)

All I do is make up a simple name that&#039;s easy to remember, find an address that isn&#039;t mine but definitely exists, and memorize all that info. I&#039;ve got a buddy that goes all over the place to make sure he doesn&#039;t hit the same Walmart twice for a good while, but the effort just doesn&#039;t seem worth it to me. For the record I&#039;ve used CVS once and am not behind bars yet. The other advantage Walmart had over CVS is that you only have to write all you info on a piece of paper and had it to the cashier, while at the latter, a red phone manned by a computer with an obnoxious digital voice. This method is prone to failure and I&#039;ve spent a lot of time talking to tech support at Moneygram call centers in India.

For those of us who don&#039;t deal, these measures are for personal peace of mind more than anything, as well as the fact that no amount of security is too much, so long as it does impede leading a healthy productive life. For those who do delve into dealing drugs, however, these measures are not really even that paranoid, since the law has this obnoxious tendency of expending enormous amounts of time and energy hunting down drug dealers and locking them up in cages. If the police (or God forbid the DEA) notice a significant increase of say, high quality MDMA in the area, they might endeavor to shut that operation down. Because the law affords us certain rights and liberties, this can sometimes be a difficult task. Basically, they might find out you&#039;re dealing, or have a strong hunch pointing in your direction, but often enough won&#039;t have enough evidence to act. Thus, making sure things like BTC purchases are well disguised is a extremely worth-while thing to do. Even if no single piece of evidence is sufficient for a warrant, an preponderance of circumstantials can be enough to convince a judge which is all that really matters where warrants are concerned. <br />This seems like a long response now that I look at it. Turns out Tramadol makes me speedy as shit.<br /><br />Source: My OG of a law professor + my own experience and intuition.

				Wiring money isn&#039;t an issue, not if your half way smart about it. Either get someone else to wire the money for you (paying them well for their services of course), or use a fake identity (easy to make with ID purchased on SR). Either way, it isn&#039;t connected to you when the police start snooping.

Buying bitcoins is perfectly legal, but if you&#039;re the paranoid type, going to, say, CVS and having them check your ID can be off-putting to say the least. At least in my area Walmart is the only place I&#039;ve found that will process cash for btc with fake information. That and Walmart is good for small businesses in your town, the employees who work there, and the economy in general.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />thanks for the heads up @#slothrop<br /><br />from reading on here the CVS method seems a bit sketch...<br /><br />plenty of walmarts in my area...<br /><br />do you recommend composing a list of fake names or use the same fake every time?<br /><br />also, should i circulate walmarts in my area?<br /><br />whats the best practice in your opinion?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not quite that paranoid. All I do is make up a simple name that&#039;s easy to remember, find an address that isn&#039;t mine but definitely exists, and memorize all that info. I&#039;ve got a buddy that goes all over the place to make sure he doesn&#039;t hit the same Walmart twice for a good while, but the effort just doesn&#039;t seem worth it to me. For the record I&#039;ve used CVS once and am not behind bars yet. The other advantage Walmart had over CVS is that you only have to write all you info on a piece of paper and had it to the cashier, while at the latter, a red phone manned by a computer with an obnoxious digital voice. This method is prone to failure and I&#039;ve spent a lot of time talking to tech support at Moneygram call centers in India.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />thanks for the advice!<br /><br />i agree, its better to a bit paranoid than to leave any kind of trace..<br /><br />cant wait to to get the ball rolling on my first order

				Fear is a product of a darting uninformed brain. Calm your nerves, research and heavily debate your decisions and I assure you much more positive will happen then negative.

				Yeah man sure does. Ive had 30 packages and only 2 didnt make it. They were both from Amsterdam so really is nothing to worry about ordering of SR.<br /><br />I would say though, do a bit of homework before ordering. Look at feedback left and have a good look around on the forums. Do a search in the forums on your chosen vendor. You will learn a lot. One other thing is to start of with a small order first and gain some knowledge. <br /><br />Have fun!

				It might be stupid (since there&#039;s no guarantee people are telling the truth) but it&#039;s so comforting to read these posts coming from people who have had success with SR. Can&#039;t wait to figure out my encryption setup so I can start making some purchases.
