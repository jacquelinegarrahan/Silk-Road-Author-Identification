				Finally -- I have a BitCoin to play around with on here.<br />The Coin came from coinbase and my first question is: How do I transfer it over to my TSR account? Is it traceable?<br />My first purchase is obviously going to be quite small (and I&#039;m not into the harder stuff).<br />I&#039;m currently renting a house with two other guys, yet we still get mail from the previous renters.<br />Would it be safer to use one of their names (And not sign when the package comes)?<br />Once I get my coins into my account and make the purchase, is there communication with the seller or some kind of order confirmation?<br />These are just basic questions and that is all I really have for right now.<br />Any insight is greatly appreciated!<br />-Danielson

				I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s traceable (I don&#039;t think it is) but you go here: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account and then press a button that says something like &quot;Click here to make a deposit&quot;. You&#039;ll see a code and you can use that to transfer your coins from wherever you have them to SR. <br /><br />Can&#039;t really comment on using another name. To be honest, I&#039;d rather use a bogus name. That way you can&#039;t get in trouble nor can your previous renters. That&#039;s just me though.<br /><br />You&#039;ll see an &quot;in transit&quot; on your account once the stuff&#039;s been sent.<br /><br />

				Once you&#039;re logged into SR, click the &#039;account&#039; link at the top of the page. In your account page you&#039;ll see &#039;To deposit bitcoins, send them to this address&#039; followed by a string of numbers and letters, which is your bitcoin address. Send coins to that address from wherever they are currently residing. Don&#039;t panic if they don&#039;t show up right away. After each transaction on SR, it&#039;s a good idea to hit the &#039;get new address&#039; link on your SR account page, and a brand new bitcoin address will be generated for you. Good luck and be careful.

				Thank you for the replies and yes I&#039;m trying to be as safe as possible.<br />As far as using fake names, I heard that&#039;s a bad idea from various sections of SR.<br />Like I said I&#039;ll be ordering small quantities (of cannabis) from reputable vendors.<br />I&#039;ve also read things about P2P for sending my address?<br />Not sure how to do this either...<br />Thanks again!

				Not p2p but PGP! Google PGP. I myself use GPG4win. It&#039;s basically a method to encrypt. You can find guides on the internet everywhere.<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/wiki/guides/multiplayer_dreams_/guide_1 Look here under &#039;encrypting your address&#039;. It basically makes sure that whatever info you send (your address in this case) can only be read by a person with a proper code. That&#039;s why most vendors have a PGP key you can use to encrypt a message to them. Only they can decrypt it.<br /><br />
