				Hi Sr, I&#039;m a new vendor who goes by the name MarloStanfield. I will be selling #4 Heroin for $100 a gr introductory and $150 a gr there after. Cocaine also for 200 a ball 375 a quarter 700 a half 1350 an oz. Also offer hard (crack) for the same as coke prices. I always have fire and don&#039;t require Fe even for newbies. All my coke is either flake or scale and will cook and iv always unless I state like this so called &quot;social cocaine&quot; which I&#039;ll offer later down the line for 125 a ball 900 an oz. All my product comes in rocks including heroin. I only ship to the US. I&#039;m looking for season members to send 8 free half a gram samples of each to. You pay the shipping which youcan keep in escrow. I ship express but if you prefer priority you will also have that option. My start date is March 6. My vendors page will be up next week for the samples though. No more $100 a gram coke or 250-300 a gram heroin. Or vendors selling bricks with no pic or its in a wrap or bag in the pic. I&#039;m the real ..&quot;Meet the connect&quot;

				I&#039;m not familiar with sending any product outside the u.s. But have never lost a package domestically. I can&#039;t believe the markup on the products here. 1700+ for an oz of soft or 4500 for an ounce of 60/40 heroin. Ridiculous. The brick prices dropped the end of January. I have everything ready to go as of now but this pgp thing and how to get large quantities of cash off of Sr.

				Do you have a vendor&#039;s account already?&nbsp; I love your name; big fan of the wire here!&nbsp; I will definitely review your dope and coke, no problem.&nbsp; I can also start a thread for you since you don&#039;t have enough posts to make a thread outside the newbie section.&nbsp; msg me here or get at me on the main site.&nbsp; my name is the same in both sites.&nbsp; peace!

				The listings are up but I&#039;m not starting shipping til tommorow. I atleast want you to see what your buying. I have pix I will load in a couple hours using a desktop computer. This ipad onion browser keeps crashing. I only have one sample going out so far. Only sending 4 instead of 8 now. Real Samples..not that .1 bs. You drop that on the floor its a wrap. I send a half gram of each. No hard sample though. I&#039;ve found its hard dealing with some who smoke crack, that&#039;s why I only wholesale it. Remember NoFe. I got oz for $1350. I want to do $1200 but I&#039;m already priced lower than anyone else. I even keep it in a drought.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not worried about the quality. If you want good shit that isnt a bag of flour or loose shake thats unidentifiable then I&#039;m your go to guy. There&#039;s vendors on sr that get coke from west bubblefuck and can have the best shiit in the world. But for $250+ a ball.....A chick better jump out and perform like her life depended on it. And all this fish scale bs. Fishscale is crazy shiny all the way through and cooks up white. That&#039;s why dudes way down south call it tilapia. Sometimes you get fish and sometimes flake but its shiny. But the price is the same for the squares. Your connect doesn&#039;t go up on you because this batch is better than the last. That sale method works with diesel. And for the most part they tell you if it&#039;ll take a 1 ..3..or 6. I don&#039;t touch it. Give it to you how i get it. Heroin is so readily available that you would do yourself a dis service by jumping on it. Your clients are gonna run. I sell nothing less than 50 grams in the real world. But do my friends and family solids and and sell 5gr to them sometime. If you look in my diesel listing you&#039;ll see in the picture 2 bags, those are 5 grams a piece. One on each side. The 30 grams is in the middle. All my coke is cook-up. And the pot don&#039;t lie. I get bricks of yay from 3 sources and you cant sit there and perform a chemistry test more than eztests for every square you get. Its not like in the movies. They might send they driver to you with 5 keys, you cut a square or triangle out the back and front of each wrap, inspect the stamp and the brick and throw him or her your bag(money). If anything is wrong they&#039;ll swap the ones you don&#039;t want out on the next trip if its still wrapped up. Now the diesel aka heroin you test that buy using certain chemicals to see what bs falls out or your Veteran dopefiend pops a vein an fires that shit up. He tells you about the rush the first feeling and if he immediately nods you know you got a champ. In Jay-Zs words &quot;Niggas don&#039;t know a brick from a bike, they keep buying hard white.&quot;

				Yo Marlo, I just put in the order for my sample.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget, I&#039;ll start a sample review thread and quote what ever intro you wanna have.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the straight ass sample you&#039;re sending!&nbsp; I&#039;m sorta late getting that order in, so I assume it&#039;ll be tomorrow that you get it out and I&#039;ll get it Friday at the latest and get that review up, pronto!&nbsp; You can check out Ballzinator&#039;s reliable reviewer thread to find honest reviewers that actually keep their word and review.&nbsp; Peace

				I am interested if you are still offering the free samples! Hell, even if you are out of them, if you could make an exception and do one more for me, I would be buying VERY soon. Needing Blow and Gear for a bunch of people!
