				All the sellers here say that track and trace seems to attract problems..<br />Is it a red flag for a package to have tracking? Dont all legit businesses sell their products with tracking numbers?

				I&#039;ve often wondered this myself. It could be that (although I&#039;m not sure) some tracked packages require signature and so in the case of a controlled delivery, you lose plausible deniability.

				From my understanding, it is customers repeatedly checking (Stupid customers&nbsp; 50-100times a day.)their tracking for no good reason., which of course raises a red flag. Check it is as little as possible in my opinion and definitely NOT with TOR

				What sellers have made this comment to you, and was it when you asked about tracking or something? I had a package from Europe take about 40 days, though over the holidays, and that was tracked via track-trace by two different people/IP addresses (myself and another) so do third-party tracking sites invite extra attention or just track-trace? I must know...

				I call total BS on this one. I sold on auction sites for years. Every item I sold had tracking. There is nothing suspicious about this at all. <br /><br />Ship with flat rate priority box with delivery confirmation and it will get to its destination in 2-3 days domestically. The less time a package is in the monkey handlers hands the less likely something will go wrong. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t check on the tracking number with tor as tor does throw up flags these days. So that part I believe. <br /><br />I even send mail to family with tracking because I know it is less likely to get lost that way.

				People are dumb and track their package through Tor, which automatically raises a red flag with the postal service to check it specifically.<br /><br />If you need to track, don&#039;t use a VPN or Tor, just go to a coffee shop and use their wifi to check it with your browser on private/incognito mode.

Anyone can send anything to anyone else, even something that needs to be signed for. If the postman comes to your door with a parcel with your name on it and says it needs a signature, you&#039;re not gonna say &quot;hey hang on mr postman, I&#039;m not expecting a signed for parcel&quot;, you&#039;ll just sign for it and then look to see what it is. Plausible deniability wouldn&#039;t be any less for a signed for parcel as an unregistered unsigned one... in the UK at least, because anyone could have mailed you that parcel without your knowledge<br /><br />I guess where you could run into problems, whether it is signed for or not, is if you are ordering bulk drugs and they wait for you to take delivery and then raid your house. In that case, as with any time when police are involved, just keep your fucking mouth shut and speak to your lawyer. Under no circumstances start babbling to the police about how it&#039;s not yours and you have no idea where it came from and in fact you&#039;ve never even heard of Silk Road (and woops... that&#039;s you incriminated yourself lol). Never talk to the police about anything, let your lawyer do the talking. Chances are that without you incriminating yourself it would be tricky to hold you accountable for a package of unknown origin that arrives at your door.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t have a browser history full of stuff about SR and how to buy bitcoins. If you&#039;re a geek you should use full disk encryption and even within that keep stuff clean. I use tor from an encrypted pen drive, on a encrypted computer running linux and set up to keep as little info about what I do as possible. Also I use a VPN for everything I do online so that the cops can&#039;t ask my ISP to tell them what sort of stuff I look at online (this comes from when I was extracting DMT all the time and didnt want the cops to be able to potentially charge me for buying legal items due to my internet history identifying what I planned to do with them, also because I am constantly pirating... and also I just like privacy and don&#039;t like being surveilled lol) <br /><br />I&#039;d have no problem ordering tracked and signed for stuff from SR, but I think keeping it domestic if possible is a good idea (not just tracked, just stuff in general). If I was ordering bulk I think I would probably prefer it was tracked, I don&#039;t think it raises any flags. I can certainly see how checking the tracking through tor, or even a vpn, could raise a flag though.

				Thanks for the useful info. I really need to look into doing an encrypted USB drive. I&#039;ll look for a thread on it.

				It&#039;s really easy. If you just want an encrypted pen drive to run tor from and maybe store some sensitive passwords or info then just download truecrypt, Choose &quot;create volume within a partition/drive&quot; and then select your usb drive, it will format it and then you choose a good strong password for it. Then when you want to use it you just plug it in, open truecrypt and tell it to mount it and enter your password. Anyone else who looks at it will just find random data with no sign that it is an encrypted drive, it looks the same as if the pen drive had been securely wiped. In the UK you can be charged if you refuse to give up passwords for an encrypted device, so being able to say that the drive contains nothing but random data because it had been secure wiped is a good form of deniabililty.<br /><br />Anyway, no tutorial really needed for that. it really is just a case of downloading truecrypt and doing it. Another option is running an operating system, like Tails for example, from a pen drive. This allows you to use a computer without leaving any trace at all that you have used it, with all internet traffic routed through tor. Not really any need for such stringent anti-surveillance though if you&#039;re just buying the occasional bit of weed from SR or something lol.

With multiple parties (buyer, vendor, buyers friend) checking it could be quite a bit. So if this damn package is getting 300 hits a day from all over it would seem suspicious, but I guess that&#039;s my paranoia. <br /><br />Personally, I only ever use tracking for resolving a problem. It will get here/there when it gets here/there&nbsp; ;) no rush.
