				I agree, Loyalist&#039;s behaviour has turned odd. I&#039;ve had at&nbsp; &gt;3 transactions with them in the past and they have not required FE and have shipped next day. <br /><br />My stats are good (0% refund in the past 6 months, 0% auto-f for the past year and more than 200 transactions and more than 200 BTC) but the last order with them they asked me to FE. When I wouldn&#039;t (after being asked twice) I offered a split order that I would 50% FE on. They responded with &#039;FE and I&#039;ll send half your coins back&#039; - yeah right!). <br /><br />I refused this offer and asked them to cancel the order (they have marked in transit but would only actually send if I FE&#039;d). <br /><br />They haven&#039;t cancelled the order or responded to the last&nbsp; message. <br /><br />BE VERY CAREFUL - I always recommend THAT YOU NEVER FE. <br /><br />I&#039;ll update this thread if they come through with the product or this gets messy and we have to go to resolution. . . . <br /><br />Stay safe everyone. <br /><br />Erl.

				if its against the rules to require anyone to fe why do 90% of sellers get away with it even if they only require newbies to fe its still against the rules why doesnt sr force them to stop by threatening to cancel their accounts if its against the rules then why do 90% of sellers get away with it????

				If I were DPR I woundn&#039;t enforce the no-FE rule either and I can understand why the powers that be don&#039;t:<br /><br />1) Sales volumes would be lower <br />2) The speed of money exchange between buyers and vendors would slow, causing cash-flow issues on the supply side.<br />3) Buyers that FE ultimately only have themselves to blame - even 5 minutes spent on the forum would be enough to learn to never FE. <br /><br />To all the newbies - do some research and find vendors that will deal with you without requiring FE until you build some rep then you can pick and choose your vendors and products. <br /><br />Start small and learn the ropes then you&#039;ll be a man my son. <br /><br />Erl.

				I am having the same problem with loyalist, he has put a message on his vendor page saying it is down to him not having vacuum seal bags but he has not answered any of my messages, he has not even read them either.<br /><br />He accepted my order for 4g Special delivery and it says on his vendor page to use this for next day by 1pm. It was into transit within the hour but nothing arrived, this was 3 days ago now. Looking at his feedback he is asking people to FE but he never asked me. Maybe because I have over 250+&nbsp; successful transactions but now I wish he has so I could have said no and ordered elsewhere.<br /><br />I really do not want to have to wait to SR resolve but he is not even reading my messages so it&#039;s looking it it will go that way. Abysmal service to be honest, a small message explaining why it was not sent would be enough, or if he is not going to send it give me my money back and don&#039;t fuck me around like this.<br /><br />At least I never finalised early like the tons of mugs who have.

				I am a little concerned as I have an order that is 5 days old (FE&#039;d - I&#039;ve always had to FE as &lt;10 transactions) but to be fair to the guy if he was scamming he probably wouldn&#039;t post a message on his page saying don&#039;t order for a couple of days.<br /><br />I have ordered the same off him a few times and they have all come through - always takes a few days mind you.<br /><br />Anyway I will give it another few days before getting too worried.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Yes this is a new account and no I am not Loyalist (I think you only have to look at the writing style to see that)...no offence Loyalist if you&#039;re reading.&nbsp; :P<br />

It was there 14 days.<br />Since I wrote 3 new messages that have remained unanswered.<br /><br />I still have received nothing.<br /><br />I do not think the seller is correct. I lost $ 85.64 weed $ 2.93 shipping.<br /><br />Never finalize an order with loyalist. Go rather order elsewhere, other sellers are honest and more &quot;loyal&quot;.<br /><br />However, I would put this message up to date, if the order arrives, or if Loyalist finally responds to my messages!

				I don&#039;t know WTF this vendor is playing at right now. Ive ordered before and had no issues, hes the only vendor I have ever FE for, he insists on it, so I gave him a shot on a small order and he came through, I made another 2 orders, and neither have shown up, strangely he HAS NOT asked me to FE for either! I certainly won&#039;t be if he tries it either lol<br /><br />This guy is taking money from everyone and not sending anything, and does not appear to have for several weeks, I did a post on another thread saying I had some faith he might come through, but I retract that now. He is clearly about to do a runner once he has taken enough cash, things have been shakey on the road recently as we all know..<br /><br />REPORT THIS VENDOR AS A SCAM - serious I have and the more that do the sooner SR can get this idiot of the road!!!!

				Maybe im outta place expanding this discussion to the whole vendor state of SR, but with a lot of posts about selective shipping from vendors<br /><br />it seems it should be related that this is a common, shitty, dealer tactic. They are trying to force the hands of small orders, and avoid having <br /><br />their time wasted. FE for under 10 trans is almost like a cover charge because of the heaps of orders vendors get and like cyberscour said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&#039;Vendors require FE for new buyers because they can extort the vendor very easily and get free drugs by opening up resolutions and saying the vendor is a lying cheating bastard that ain&#039;t got no pancake mix.&#039;<br /><br />Lets be real, most big vendors probably get their profits from like 33% of their customers and the rest arent worthless but new buyers honestly <br /><br />dont have a right to take up so much of their strung out time for negligible amounts of profit, or scams. That being said most people here on<br /><br />the forms like to teach and will help with any question, but as a vendors order volume increases in fold with popularity their distribution <br /><br />systems get severely strained, and put up answering form-type questions less and less. Eventually they either start to pace themselves, e.g. <br /><br />stopping orders to restructure, or just keep the cash flowing as their orders boom, and try to expand along the way[VERY COMMON!!] This is <br /><br />how you get situations like bringing in new people to control the vendor account and they run off with all the FE btc even though the vendor <br /><br />had excellent reviews.[Lucydrop] Or even the vendor themselves just start loath the spam mix of real vs. fake problems new buyers bring and <br /><br />just use FE for one last cash out, while keeping people on the hook with reassuring messages till the final exit.[F16] And finally in its simplest <br /><br />of forms to keep the cash flowing vendors will mark in transit before they actually acquire more product, then ask to FE.[SuperTrips] I implore <br /><br />anyone who has ever FE or needs to or whatever to learn the history of any of the vendors mentioned. Vendors earn their worth through <br /><br />reviews which drives that 5/5 insanity, but the buyer should respect the power they wield from one bad review. Earn your buying stats so that <br /><br />you never have to FE. Once youve earned it help keep the peace against those who havent [spam newbies] and those who dont deserve it <br /><br />anymore [misleading vendors]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />~~~ With great power comes great responsibility~~~&nbsp;

				Re,<br />For my part, I think it is a big mistake to give opportunity for FE of SilkRoad. The escrow policy SR is very developed.<br /><br />A buyer who does not respect the deal must be definitely ruled out.<br />A seller who asks FE too.<br />It should be sharp as a thin blade.<br />I think the greater part of buyers, such as the greater part of sellers are honest about SilkRoad.<br />Vendors who fear not being paid are tied with buyers who fear they will not be delivered.<br />However, I understand that some sellers fear new buyers, as buyers may fear new sellers.<br />However, some sellers do not require FE, business and works perfectly.<br />And some buyers, probably too excited, do not hesitant to FE on request, although that possibility should simply be dismissed.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I think of it ... But maybe I do not have a good analysis? ...

				Agreed man, if he had done what he claimed, sent everything Saturday, then the SD items would have come by now (you can post them on a Sat, they just won&#039;t get there till Monday). The fact that I have not seen anyone update or leave feedback on anything coming, it does not appear he is telling the truth again!<br /><br />All I can do is repeat what I said in regards to reporting the vendor, the more of us do this the faster a resolution will come about!

				Just noticed 2 people have received orders today so far.<br /><br />Although I have a feeling these guys are small orders as one of them say he doubled their order. Can&#039;t see him sending me 8g instead of 4 somehow. Despite all the hassle they have also given him a 5/5. Are people this fucking stupid? All you are doing is ensuring other buyers do not know the full story and think he is OK to buy from.<br /><br />One of them says he kept in contact, he has not even read my messages. Selective scammer seems the right phrase and I will be honest with feedback when I get the chance.

				Well it looks like those lucky enough to not FE have got a refund from SR, I think with the amount of scam reports and resolutions SR have finally taken notice. I still have 8 days on my resolution so I just have to wait myself, glad I didn&#039;t FE (Although he had of asked as usual, I would of).<br /><br />What an utter arsehole!

				No nothing today - at least nothing from loyalist. Never had a non-delivery yet looks like this may end up being my first.<br /><br />The thing that bugs me the most though was that he actually had really nice oil which as far as UK goes, is a real rarity.<br /><br />I&#039;m FE&#039;d so nothing much to do really other than hang for a bit and perhaps update my feedback down to 1/5 next week - I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp;get the impression he&#039;s not scamming, just a bit of a mess at the moment. If he is scamming then he could do a much better job. Liek I said if you were scamming new vendors asking for FE then surely you wouldn&#039;t post a message saying don&#039;t order for a while. Then again maybe you would...

				I&#039;m inclined to agree that this isn&#039;t 100% purposeful scamming, more likely cash flow or personal issues. <br /><br />Still, the message on their profile today says that all orders have shipped out - then he gave a date in the future for when they shipped.?!?<br /><br />It is a great shame because as 329156 said his oil is very good and hard to find in the UK. <br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure I can deal with vendors marking items in transit and not actually posting - it makes managing drop / burner addresses very difficult. <br /><br />I burned two addresses when the vendor &#039;theXchange&#039; had similar issues and don&#039;t have an endless supply of willing mail handlers.<br /><br />Loyalist - I think it would do your reputation the world of good if you updated your forum thread (and&nbsp; / or this one) with a bit of an update. <br /><br />As for now i&#039;m heading down the resolution route. . . <br /><br />Peace all, <br /><br />Erl.

				Kinda stuck as to what to do now, apparently my order has been sent out today. Not sure to wait until tomorrow now or what? <br /><br />Kinda feel bad for the vendor now as he is clearly having problems and I don&#039;t want to take it to SR and then get my stuff the next day. Don&#039;t get it wrong, I am still annoyed as I ordered Special Delivery last Monday but I a am not the kind of person who will take advantage rip a vendor off. I think the best thing to do is wait one more day, I will be pissed off if it does not come though as I could just resolve it and order elsewhere today.<br /><br /><br />Gaz

				He does not seem to be even considering refunds without a resolution so if that&#039;s what you want your need to see that through.<br /><br />I think your find your package will turn up 2nd class post this week man. I cant see him refunding the postage, I recon he will be hoping people are just relieved to have got it...<br /><br />Ive had further comms with him throughout today, short and cryptic lol Once I have this last order with him resolved Im won&#039;t use him again. I appreciate all vendors have problems, I really do, but its how they go about resolving them that is key to me. <br /><br />I have a handful of vendors now that will PM me and say if something is out of stock. If something is late I also have a handful of vendors I know will answer coms and keep me updated, its just logical to stick those who do well. After all what is to say this wont happen to Loyalist in the future and he will deal with it in the same way he has this!!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Just as a heads up Loyalists claim of being the only UK hash oil vendor is not currently true. BillyBigBuds has some oil back in stock, its more pricey but its much more refined so... <br /><br />Also NaturalOils Super Ball is what I currently have, lovely stuff, not cheap, but well worth a look in if your into hash oils (currently have discounted offers, these guys totally rock man, professional all the way!) They are not UK based so delivery takes a week or 2, but well worth it<br /><br />On that note BudWorxUK wax is incredible stuff :) BudworxUK service is not the best at times, but they keep up coms and always deliver :)<br />
