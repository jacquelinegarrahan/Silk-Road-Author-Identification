				I have been doing business with Moon Unit for a very long time now, and I think I need to write this to set people straight on Moon Unit.<br /><br />Moon Unit has always been my favorite vendor. I have such a sense of security ordering from Moon Unit because of his &quot;somewhat&quot; strict restrictions. If you follow Moon&#039;s guidelines, he/she is one of the most wonderful vendors you will ever encounter. My stats on SR show that I am a veteran, even though I&#039;m in the friggin noob section on the forums :( ...<br /><br />Moon is stealthy and fast.... I have never had a package take more than 5 days from Moon. <br /><br />I often just find myself messaging Moon just because I enjoy talking to him/her. If that doesn&#039;t show you that he/she is one of the best vendors....then try his product.<br /><br />Moon&#039;s product is the only dmt that can &quot;get me off&quot;. I have had some of the most profound experiences with Moon&#039;s dmt. ( It takes you to the &quot;Moon&quot;).&nbsp; It was rumored that Moon&#039;s last batch was jimjam...And for those of you reading this that think alike that, I feel sorry for you. I truly do. (May try holding it in longer or smoking it right?)<br /><br />I have had damn near every vendors dmt. Moon Units dmt is literally the only stuff I like. Even rogerpetes WAY over priced dmt isn&#039;t even as good. (trust me). <br /><br />I am telling you, if you step up your security, and increase your stats, you WILL get the same quality of service I receive. He has a 100 rating for a reason :)<br /><br /><br />Product : 10/5<br />Shipping: 10/5<br />Stealth: 10/5<br />Communication : 10/5<br />Friendliness: 10/5<br />Overall: Over 9000!<br /><br /><br />To Moon: If you see this, put it in your review thread. <br /><br />Ill see ya in hyperspace Moon. ttyl<br /><br />&lt;(^^,)&gt;[ L ]

				So I am very interested in ordering from moon unit but I had some questions about his security policy.. I have never used PGP before so I just set up GPG4usb, made my key, and sent him an encrypted message via SR&#039;s messaging to confirm that I have the correct stats necessary to make a purchase. When I encrypt my address, I then insert that PGP key that I created into the address box? What does he mean by &quot;Your GPG key version must be *NIX&quot;? Thanks for the help, I&#039;m just trying to make a purchase fast as I can
