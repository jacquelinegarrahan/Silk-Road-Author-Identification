				First let me say this: I COULD BE WRONG<br /><br />Otherwise, this vendor is showing all the signs of a massive payout scam.<br /><br />Only 3 Months as a Vendor<br />A recent review reports of a product not showing up<br />Mandatory FE<br />Huge amount listings at MAXIMUM item listing of 99<br />Only shipping very small amounts <br />Newest pictures of his bud show some tiny nugs stating &quot;Ran out of the big ones&quot;<br />Another forum member swears this guy is a scammer<br /><br /><br />This needs to be known. PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT COULD BE IN PROGRESS. <br /><br />I really feel this shit is about to go down, you fuckers should spread the word.<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t, I&#039;ll eat my words and take it in the ass.<br /><br />

				He is in the top 6% out of all the vendors on SR, If he likes making his huge amounts of cash then I am sure he will not quit. He is just peaking right now and needs to expand. <br /><br />I would suggest him to add more people. (I would relocate for him)&nbsp; If he could get some runners to make drops for him to speed up his shipping to around next day shipping would increase his profits by 10fold.<br /><br />And for the scammer part, I placed a qp order on the 26th and will update when it comes. He says 10 days is his limit so I will have to wait and see.

				I must side zyx and wn on this one. I dont know if my opinion matters really, but i ordered from tj a few weeks back.&nbsp; on weight, he does it by fe bc he takes the money up front to buy the larger weights.&nbsp; He does sometimes offer qps and hps without fe, for a $50 premium.&nbsp; they just get sold out very quickly. a great, honest vendor.&nbsp; and a pleasure to deal with. hope this helps,<br />mmr

				Nothing yet, and barely any people who have orders QPs, HPs, or LBs have updated their FE feedback.<br /><br />Only a couple have, and they both smell fishy.<br /><br />I just won&#039;t be surprised, I&#039;ve had this feeling for about a week now.<br /><br />Time will tell.<br /><br />

				Fuck you stupid mod. Your going to eat my shit when this comes to light. Stop encouraging people to continue&nbsp; buying from a fucking apparent scammer.<br /><br />Thurgoods source went bye bye along with all his FE funds when SDM got arrested. I know this to be fact. He&#039;s snatching up everything and anything he can now. Thurgood was waiting for SDM to ship his bulk order when he got arrested. He lost all of every ones money and the weed. He has no connections because he is not a real drug dealer.<br /><br />You will regret this. But continue to denounce the only beam of truth. Your fall from grace will be entertaining.

				FE scams in general are one of the main reasons we tell people that they should NEVER FINALIZE EARLY.&nbsp; We aren&#039;t here to hold everyone&#039;s hands though - there is personal responsibility involved and when people decide to finalize early, they are making that decision on their own.&nbsp; I wish people would listen when we say DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY.&nbsp; :-\

				Astor:<br /><br />As soon as anyone has any proof of me scamming is the day you can feel sad. As it is I&#039;m filling many orders a day and have lots of weed despite coachellas claims. Notice how none of my customers are dissatisfied? Every FE order has gone scam-free, I will admit, some took a little long. <br /><br />Edit: Doesn&#039;t the fact that I&#039;ve been revamping security alone show that I&#039;m not running away? Why would I want to move over to tails 100% and buy a new computer to do that if I was just going to scam people and close up shop?<br /><br />Jack:<br /><br />He can call me a scammer all he wants. I&#039;m motivated by money and any businessman will see that a $60,000 scam isn&#039;t worth a $400,000/year business. It&#039;d be ludicrous for me to do that. I&#039;m not going anywhere despite one asshole&#039;s words. <br /><br />Cirrus:<br /><br />I don&#039;t want any special treatment. If actual customers label me a scammer, then I expect to be banned. That won&#039;t happen despite this one asshole&#039;s words. <br /><br />Crimson Chin/Dod/pyschopath:<br /><br />Show us the proof of me and SDM. I don&#039;t know a single fucking thing about SDM except for that he got popped before I was even on SR. What strains do I have that are only from SDM and wouldn&#039;t be possible to find in the state with legalized marijuana and every strain imagineable. Do you realize where I live. You can say that&#039;s a photoshopped picture, I don&#039;t care. You say it took me way too long to upload... Hey, Jack, Bruce, do you guys keep your product in the house you live in? You do, right? So you can take pictures of it at all times of the night for people who don&#039;t believe you have weed but have 0 proof. Cause that&#039;s what I do...<br /><br />Lets see the proof. That&#039;s all I ask. We have more proof than needed to show that you&#039;re a liar and a scammer, but I&#039;d like to see what proof you have against me. I&#039;ll leave it at that.<br /><br />Customers:<br />Everyone who&#039;s bought from me knows how good my weed is and has loved my service. That&#039;s why I&#039;ve been on here for 3 months, over 1170 fans, and top 6%. Scamming won&#039;t get me there. You&#039;ll see when you get your package. Thank you for your business.

				Why are you over extending yourself so much?? It seems growing your sales is your priority over customer service. Why not just have a higher priced non fe lising? Seems like you have a tendency to go away for a few days a time,&nbsp; or wait a while before shipping perfect cover for a scammer.&nbsp; Everything is gonna seem normal till after a week of FEs.<br /><br />This guy is way to overambitious its not good one way or the other. He seems like a really nice guy, but so have many other scammers in the past.
