				Hello everyone i am new to the board. Have been on Sr a while now but was always apprehensive about ordering until my mates had tried and successfully succeeded. That is when i decided&nbsp; to go ahead and make my first order and i made a newbie mistake of Fe to LegalizeMj and lost £600 dew to my mistake. I am fully to blame for that.<br /><br />So next i decided to go with a top UK vendor JesusOfRave and made my order for his well praised Mdma. I messaged him asking If i needed to Fe dew to my stats and thankfully he said no. So i make my order and eagerly await my order. two weeks have gone by and i have yet to receive anything no package or seizure letter ( This is a domestic order btw ). I have messaged the seller numerous times with no response, it states on his page because he is shutting down he will no longer be replying to pms. ( Im not happy with this because at the end of the day he may be shutting down but he still has outstanding orders and in my opinion should be staying in contact with those customers until they receive their package) but its his business his rules so i go along with them. He says anyone with outstanding orders will be dealt with in the resolution center and he will deal with customers through that, Iv been in the resolution center 3 days now and he has yet to reply to me or accept any resolution i have suggested.<br /><br />Two more days Sr admin will be taking over and i just don&#039;t understand why he is not contacting me or giving me any help to resolve the situation what so ever. Im already down £600 from that scammer LegalizeMj, and cant afford to take another hit. I am in no way accusing JoR of scamming obvious he is not a scammer, Im only here to ask if anyone could help me understand whats going on? and if anyone has any experience on how this scenario is going to play out?<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance for any reply&#039;s and information giving. Much love<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Generally if the vendor doesnt respond to the resolution from what I have heard you will get what you ask for. I have done business with this vendor before and he seemed like a stand up guy but you never know as people can change in an instant. Best of luck

				Yea all his feedback makes him seem like a standup guy but unfortunately my experience has been other wise. I gave him two choices of resolution to choose from so i guess the admin will just pick from them. Thanks for your imput.

				Aw Sorry to hear that Smoky20, I can&#039;t say much since I&#039;ve never dealt with JoR, Either way, by the looks of it I think it will be alright. I believe that either your order will come through, or you&#039;ll get a refund, and hopefully a 100% refund. That must really suck for a second order! <br /><br />I can vouch for Schizofreen&#039;s ecstasy pills (Mortal Kombats to be precise). He also sells MDMA crystals and at a very reasonable price (Not sure about purity though). He maintained good contact with me and I feel that he&#039;s a trust able vendor. But its up to you ultimately :)<br /><br />Best of luck with your JoR issue, hopefully others who have ordered from him have some advice for ya.

				Thanks for your kind words, i don&#039;t understand why this has happened with JoR as he is a top seller for a year here and everyone has given him positive feedback a number of his packages have not showed up recently as i have noticed in his feedback but they all stated that they came to an agreement with the seller and sorted out a refund, yet with me he is showing no communication and not responding to any resolutions.<br /><br />I have now requested 100% refund in the resolution center due to the fact he wont contact me or help resolve the matter in any way two days the admins will decide and i hope they take my side as it has dragged on longer than i had hoped or expected buying from a domestic top seller first class delivery.<br /><br />I&#039;m also starting to question if the package was sent in the first place, i think because he is shutting down he might have been overwhelmed with orders and maybe marked my item in transit before he realized he was out of product and instead of admitting his mistake he has just let it drag out to see what the admins decide? guess I&#039;ll never know why he treated me with such disrespect&nbsp; &nbsp;when all his other customers rate him so highly.

				I cant see any reason for JOR fucking you in ANY way. In short, he is the man.<br /><br />He recently closed up shop for a hiatus. I also cant see him taking an order if he does not plan on filling it..<br /><br />This would have to be a postal error.

				If that is the case then why wont he reply to any of my messages, he will not reply to pms which i don&#039;t understand why just because he is shutting down doesnt mean he should ignore his customers with outstanding orders. But i put up with that and let it go to the resolution center because on his page thats what it says to do and i requested the extension like it states on his page and yet he does not reply. I asked him if the item was sent and no reply to that either, im not here to run the guy down because it is obvious he is a good honest seller so it doesnt make sense as to why he has left me with no contact what so ever. First class domestic from a guy who knows about stealth has the highest chance of anything to get through and it was a small amount also 10g mdma and yet i have received nothing not even a letter to say it was seized and he wont accept resolutions or messages from me so i will have to see who side the admins take on this.&nbsp;

				Interesting to see your post as I was considering using him as all info indicated he was reputable. I saw his messages about him shutting up shop. It could just be that he&#039;s gone on holiday for a week or two and maybe mistakenly didn&#039;t complete all outstanding orders. You definitely wouldn&#039;t want to be dealing with this kind if shit while you&#039;re trying to relax on a beach somewhere.<br />Keep us posted, would like to know how it turns out.

				I will keep this updated to see how it turns out, it will be up to the Sr admins in two days to decide a resolution. I would still advise giving the guy a go once he is back as i am not here to destroy his reputation in any way what so ever. Just stating my experience with him and was hoping someone could shed some light on my situation or give me some advice if they have been in a similar situation before. I&#039;m sure their is a reason why this has happened but yet to know why and i probably never will unfortunately, all i want is the situation sorted and out of my head because it has really started to annoy me. Thanks everyone for your input
