				also posted in the thread made by ralph.<br /><br />i became a fan and sent GS a pm on sr, was going to wait to place my sample order til i got an answer, but i just saw the listings are down :( still haven&#039;t heard back from GS either, but maybe that&#039;s his way of saying the samples are gone and i don&#039;t get one? idk kinda confused cause i&#039;m on ambien but i definitely want to try and review both. i have extensive experience with both rolls/mdma and xanax

				Received Sample Pack today!&nbsp; Great pack BTW, nothing like some xanax after a fun night of partying.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realize how few samples you gave out. Lucky me.&nbsp; I will provide a report later this weekend, but it is almost not needed as everything looks legit and these are great pills based on all accounts I have read.<br /><br />Also keep in mind, his current listing for the superman&#039;s is for 2 pills. Best price I have seen. Grab them up!<br /><br />+1 for you my sir.<br />I only have one minor gripe. Packaging. All in all, there isn&#039;t any problems with it so don&#039;t be alarmed. <br />GEAR..PM me here or on SR for any advice if you would like!<br />Keep up the good work!<br />You should start a thread in the rumor mill for more exposure!

				I wil be having another round of samples son as my product arives. I&#039;ll be giving out 5 more samples as son as my sour desiel shows up. Are there anyone interested in do a review for my sour desiel? It wil be for 1 gram and that&#039;s how they wil be listed. I am not a bulk dealer by no means but if you want more then just ad to the quantity. Before I set the price I am going to lok at the price that other vendors charge for it but I was thinking about $12 a gram. Al my prices right now are going to be low because this is my grand opening.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m thinking of runing a loto to find my 5 samplers for it. I know one thing. My keyboard is screwed and I got to get a new one<br />

Everyone was scheduled to receive their samples by the 18th and 19th so I hope we will hear from the rest in a day or two.

				I just wanted to stop in and show my buddy GS some love and good luck doing ya thing vending!! this is a cool cat!! So i know he will make a awesome vendor. Just thought id stop by, i was wanting to leave something in the dicussion on your page but i got banned for 20 days for ripping a shiity vendor a new one , he deserved it though and No one else was saying a thing, and any of the old school that have been here for 1 year or more know me well and know im not gonna just leave a 5.5 and sinning review when a vendor does not truly deserve it.. <br /><br />Come on to all the new guys, thats whats wrong with SR today, shitty vendors with perfect scores no on speaking about them for fear of being blacklisted.. DONT SWEAT THAT PEOPLE!!! ANY RIGHTIOUS VENDOR THat even has the 1% chance of seeing your name actually put on a blacklist will fully understand ..<br /><br />Some vendors are just as honest and want things to run like a well oil tuned machine, just buy,send your drugs,releaser money give good review, but seems these days we have asshole vendors trying to blackmail and everything they can to a buyer. FUCK THAT AND FUCK THEM DONT TAKE THAT SHIT NEW GUYS!!<br /><br />GEARSHIFTER WILL DAMN SURE TELL U ALL THE SAME!!&nbsp; LOVE LIVE SR!!
