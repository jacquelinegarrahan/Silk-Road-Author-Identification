				I regularly use cocaine on weekends at social events. My normal guy i get it from charges me on average Â£40 pounds for a half gram of what i thought was high quality cocaine. It&#039;s probably not even weighed as a half gram, probably 0.3 - 0.4.<br /><br />So anyway i decided to give Lloydsbrothers stuff a try after reading some good reviews about his product. Amazing stealth packaging and fast delivery time. Looked a lot bigger than the half grams im used to, so it was either overweight or more likely bang on 0.5 and im used to being fucked over at 0.3 ;)<br /><br />First thing i did was move it from the vacuum sealed packaging into a baggie for easier access later. Smelt really potent. Accidentally got a tiny bit in my finger and decided to rub it on my top gum. Whole top of my mouth went numb for about 10 minutes. Really wasn&#039;t expecting that off the very very small amount i had on my finger.<br /><br />Later on I had my first line, it hit me pretty quickly, really nice clean stuff, mild euphoria, sunk straight into my nose, just like good cocaine should. Left no annoying stray power visible on my nose. Very strong stuff, small lines will do the trick! 0.5 goes a long way and i managed to make it last me Friday and Saturday night. Overall very impressed and will be ordering again. Just wish i could afford this quality gear more often! I experienced no comedown affects what so ever also which i was very pleased about.

				Received my first order from Lloydsbrothers on Friday.&nbsp; Only ordered a gram this time but I&#039;ll definitely be getting an eighth on my next order.<br /><br />The smell alone when you open the bag is enough to put a big smile on your face, its really overpowering.&nbsp; Just like coke I used to get in the late 90s (when I didn&#039;t realise how good I had it).&nbsp; Gives you a good euphoric high with no edginess at all.&nbsp; One of the biggest plus points (for me anyway) was that I didn&#039;t have a blocked nose the next day and I ALWAYS do even after tiny amounts of C.<br /><br />My only regret is that I forgot to weigh the fucking thing so I&#039;ve no idea if it was under or overweight. Looked about right though.<br />

				Latest batch is not as pure as my previous order from him (week before xmas).<br /><br />This batch definately has a small amount of amphetamine and other cutting agents, which gives me rock hard yellow sheet plastic boogers.<br /><br />However<br /><br />It is still very good quality, with a high C content IMHO.<br /><br />Will be using this guy again.
