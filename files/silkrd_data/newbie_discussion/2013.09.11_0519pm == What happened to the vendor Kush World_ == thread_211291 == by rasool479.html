				I placed an order with Kush World yesterday. Today, I still see my order &quot;in processing&quot;, but the product ad has been withdrawn along with their whole vendor site. I have messaged them, but received no response. Meanwhile, I cannot cancel the order, and my bitcoins are tied up in escrow.<br /><br />Does anyone know what is going on with this vendor?<br /><br />Thanks!

				The same thing happened to me today with Mastermind Designs. Does this mean a vendor is banned? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s stealth mode, because I prior vendor I purchased from went in to stealth mode, and I can still see his vendor page (and that he is operating in stealth mode) when I click on his name. Mastermind Designs still comes up as a member; i.e., I can message him. <br /><br />In any case, after a certain period of time, if you haven&#039;t received your order, you can click &quot;resolve.&quot; This will take you to the resolution center. You can propose a 100% refund. I think you can also message customer support and request that the refund not appear on your stats (vendors are wary of users with refund rates).

				It usually means their vendor privleges were removed. If you have something &quot;In Transit&quot; It should still come to you and you release the funds like necessary.<br /><br />If it says &quot;Processing&quot; It will probably stay like that for 4 days until you have the availability to hit cancel.<br /><br /><br />He probably was doing something against the TOS like accepting money out of escrow, etc. In the chance it was something petty and he can rectify then his vendor account will reopen but more likely then not if when you click a vendor and it goes to message them then they are demoted.

				I had some issues with KushWorld a couple weeks ago. Found him to be a VERY shady character and will not be ordering from him again.<br /><br />There are so many better sellers (and his stuff isn&#039;t as good as he claims either) so don&#039;t waste your time and money on him.<br /><br />

				I made the mistake of trying to buy BTC from KushWORLD (Listing:My BTC FOR MONEYGRAM OR WU 5% FEE)<br />When I tried to check my order, his vendor account had been removed, but my order status was &quot; In Transit&quot;.<br />&nbsp;I figured that I would still get my coins, since all he had to do was put them into my account. <br />His vendor account is back up, and I still don&#039;t have my coins.<br />ordered: September 7, 2013, 10:46 pm UTC<br />shipped: September 10, 2013, 4:54 pm UTC<br />I placed that order with KushWorld 7 days ago, and have not received anything. <br />The order has been &quot; in transit&quot; since the 10th.

				C8indiaMIKE1,<br /><br />Have you had any luck messaging him since his account came back up?<br /><br />ONE (of the multiple) issues I had with Kush World was that he marked my package In Transit, waited 4 days, and then put it in the mail.
