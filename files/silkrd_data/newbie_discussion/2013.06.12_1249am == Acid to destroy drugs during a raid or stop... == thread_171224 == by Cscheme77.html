				Um.. shiat I&#039;ve heard about people doing this. It probably depends on the drug you are trying to destroy.<br /><br />You might want to look into <br /><br />ACIDS: Hydrochloric acid, Sulfuric Acid, Phosphoric Acid<br />BASES: Sodium Hydroxide (lye)<br /><br />I imagine you want the &quot;bath&quot; to be the strongest concentration possible, I also think it would be wise to run Marquis tests on your destructive chemicals to determine if there is a reaction (might make it hard to verify next step if there is one)<br />Then you could say drop small amounts of a drug (say MDMA for example) into a tiny amount of your acid or base, and then test that to see if it still tests positive for MDMA (would turn black)

				I never though of this before but sounds like a great idea because if you had the acid ready you could just throw in your drugs in a matter of seconds and even if the police get in quite quickly I would like to see them try and stop the reaction!! lol<br /><br />I cant really answer your question about which acid to use but +1 for the risk reducing idea! now for some research!

				your idea is solid in theory..<br /><br />but..<br /><br />generally speaking you won&#039;t get raided on at 3pm, it will be 3am when you&#039;re sleeping.<br />How&#039;s your acid bath going to help you when the next thing you know a swat team is screaming at you to put your hands behind your head?<br />&nbsp;???

				Heh I&#039;m no longer a noob but I like chatting!<br /><br />Ok, first off this product and probably others are widely available (at least in U.S.A.) over the counter so a silk road vendor really isn&#039;t necessary. Pool shops, hardware stores, pharmacies/grocery.. etc.. check drain cleaner section first :D<br /><br />Granted it wouldn&#039;t look good.. but as long as it doesn&#039;t test positive for controlled substances i don&#039;t really give a fuck.<br />Its better than say getting caught red handed with a kilo of MDMA or Coke. Shit, even if your already fucked, I think it would be difficult for them to quantify the drugs that you had. I feel like that would &quot;probably&quot; be a good thing. Plus maybe it is possible to completely destroy the said substance than say, flushing down the toilet which would prolly leave powder on the seat. Then your still in trouble as you do have testable product and you tried to destroy the evidence. Better than nothing, but I think if you do it right you can stay pretty safe.<br /><br />But hypothetically if i was going to set something like this up, I guess I would get a 5gallon bucket (or 55 gal for you big timers out there) Fill it up with 3 gallons of distilled water and dissolve the maximum amount of NaOH possilbe.<br /><br />3 gallons = 11356.2 mL&nbsp; and with a solubility of 1.1g/mL of water you could throw in 113456 g (25 lb in only 3 gal, redic!) I would do it over time cuz its gonna get really hot. After its dissolved and cooled, i would seal up the bucket and store it with my stash right next to each other. <br /><br />Maybe I have security cameras to wake/alert me to pigs about to break down my door. With the extra 15 seconds I run upstairs where i grab my easily accessible stash, make sure the bag is open so the solution can fill it, drop it into the bucket, and then cover it with a pre-selected weight to completely submerge it. Then maybe walk away from the bucket and hopefully it gets a little time to react before they figure out what you&#039;ve done. Maybe your house is otherwise COMPLETELY clean, and that by the time they get your sizzling bucket analyzed its destroyed organic material.<br /><br />If there is no other evidence to suggest illegal activity, and the product is completely destroyed then they really can&#039;t prove that what you destroyed was illegal, case closed for now.<br /><br />Since I am a psychedelic enthusiast, my Lifetime stash can pretty much fit in my hand. I&#039;m all about super secret caches.<br /><br />

				bleach is your best friend.<br /><br />Cops regent test drugs and regent testers use colors. So if you put your drugs in bleach even if they are recovered the regent tester would be messed up on the colors because of the bleach.

It would also be a lot of extra work for no benefit to anyone apart from serving as database of evidence against me if my computer ever fell into the wrong hands. That is why I don&#039;t do it. I have never threatened a buyer, don&#039;t need to as they are a pretty happy crowd which makes me happy. Also pretty sure it would be pointless; think the police would be more interested in the vendor rather than the buyer who might have a couple of grams of hash. <br /><br />Joolz and his alter egos have been slinging this shit at me for weeks now, and none of it sticks because I pretty much everything he claims about me is just wrong. His buyer account blufields placed an order with me nearly a month ago but it was never done as I had 4 message from him when I logged in, with the upshot of the incoherence being to cancel the order, which I did. Then the shit-storm. Here is a link to one of the first threads the accuser made, who is now threatening to release my details in a turn of beautiful irony. Its a lot of reading, but I doubt it will take the whole lot to make up your mind. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164643.msg1195637#msg1195637<br /><br />Peace

				I would save your time and effort and put them into hiding your stashes well and finding a suitable solicitor/lawyer BEFORE you get into trouble. <br /><br />Should you get busted, you want it to be for a small amount (because the bulk is hidden away and all they found was your in hand amount), and you already know not to say a damned word to the cops until you have spoken to your legal advice, right?<br /><br /><br />
