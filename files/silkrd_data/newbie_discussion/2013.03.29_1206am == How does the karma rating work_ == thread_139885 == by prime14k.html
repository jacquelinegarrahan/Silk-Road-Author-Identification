				Karma isn&#039;t the only reason to aspire.&nbsp; I just found out from someone who recently turned 100 that the best kept secret is that at 100 posts you don&#039;t have to do CAPTCHA&#039;s ever again to post.&nbsp; I think I have about 5 posts left to get there.&nbsp; Saints be praised!!<br />
