				You can setup an email account at like lavabit or inbox.com but the thing is they all require scripts to be enabled in your browser, This is a problem for anonymity because enabling scripts can leak your IP, You could however just use another connection like public wifi hotspot and register the account there.

				I dont know, nothing appeared on the screen . How to check if I enabled scripts? The safe mail site is very simple. Nothing I accepted from the site. That is what the website states :<br />Safe-mail is the most secure, easy to use communication system. It includes encrypted mail system with collaboration features and document storage functions. Always accessible at any time from anywhere!<br />3 Mb space is free. More space and functionality is supplied under Premium Packages. There are no advertisements, downloads or cookies. Safe-mail supports most hardware platforms and any operating system. Includes file storage, spam filters and anti virus protection. Full compatibility with most browsers, email clients and all relevant protocols including POP, SMTP, IMAP, S/MIME and PKI.

				Ok, so I checked the ip adress from which the safe mail account was created and it was tor ip adress. Success I think :) I blocked all the scripts as well

				safe-mail.net has an interface that doesn&#039;t require any scripts so it&#039;s a good choice, to turn off scripts, click on the S next to the torbutton and click on forbid scripts globally.<br /><br />Riseup.net is also a good choice but it&#039;s not that easy to get an account there.

				I think you can use i2p.to to create your account but there isn&#039;t any webmail except for the one in i2p itself which is more of an app.. Even if using something like thunderbird I don&#039;t think you could use i2pmail without downloading i2p, or it would be a lot harder to configure which would make it easier to just download i2p :P You can use tor-&gt;i2p if you use i2p in whonix though, if you&#039;re concerned about i2p&#039;s security..<br /><br />Safe-mail is good too because of the option to use an interface without scripts. Secure-mail.biz also seems pretty good, whonix&#039;s developer has a secure-mail.biz address so it shouldn&#039;t be that bad.<br /><br />@VinnieJones : You can&#039;t use gmail or hotmail without scripts so it&#039;s not too good over tor.
