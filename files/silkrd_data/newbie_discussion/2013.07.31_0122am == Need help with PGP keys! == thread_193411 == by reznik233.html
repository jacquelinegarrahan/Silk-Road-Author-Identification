				Hey all,&nbsp; <br /><br />I am new to the SR, and after doing many hours of research, the only thing I cannot quite grasp is the PGP encryption process.&nbsp; Is there anyone that could maybe provide a link or help me out with a step by step guide to sending a vendor a message using PGP and decrypting their message they send back?<br /><br />I would appreciate it so much!&nbsp; The people on here seem very helpful so I am looking forward to the responses.&nbsp; Thanks again

				gpg4usb is what most people here use and recommend. I don&#039;t use it myself but I believe there is a guide on how to use it on their site as well as the freeware.<br /><br />The first thread on this board is also dedicated to helping people with PGP. If you having any questions after trying the software for yourself I would suggest asking in there.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				It&#039;s not too difficult. I also downloaded gpg but it seemed harder to use in my opinion. I used a guide to set up PGP but still also was clueless as to how to send and receive messages. I&#039;ll tell you how. <br /><br /><br />Once you set up your account and have a key, to add another person&#039;s PGP you just copy their PGP block and paste it into the window that says, &quot;All keys&quot; and shows them which at first should only show yours after you&#039;ve made it. It will automatically find the person and you can add it. To get your own key right click on your key name and hit, &quot;Copy public key&quot; and share that with whomever you want to send you a private message. Do this same thing to get anothers public key. The only problem I had was how to encrypt and send a message or receive one. It was easy though. On the PGPtray icon, right click and you&#039;ll see &quot;Current Window&quot; and &quot;Clipboard.&quot; You can test this by sendin&#039; a message to yourself. Go to clipboard and type a message. Click &quot;Copy to clipboard.&quot; Go to &quot;Current window&quot; and select &quot;Encrypt and send&quot; and it will ask who you want to receive it. Choose your name. Type your passphrase. And it&#039;s done. Go back to clipboard and you&#039;ll see your message in PGP form, encrytped. You can now copy this and send it to the chosen recipient and only they can read it. Now go to &quot;Decrypt and verify&quot; and open your clipboard. You&#039;ll now be able to read the message.<br />Enjoy and ask any further questions you want. <br />
