				Title: <strong>Signing for Packages</strong><br />

				Everyone here says that signing for your packages is the biggest no-no of all.&nbsp; But how are you supposed to get your package if you HAVE to sign for it?&nbsp; For example, say the recipient lives in an apartment complex with a security guard stationed at the front desk.&nbsp; If a package is too large to fit in the mailbox, it&#039;s held at the security desk, and the security guards will not hand it over unless the recipient signs for it.&nbsp; What to do?<br /><br />Can&#039;t the recipient just sign for the package, and if any trouble arises, claim that they had no idea what was inside?&nbsp; I mean, that happens all the time.&nbsp; People often order things online, and by the time the package arrives, they&#039;ve forgotten that they ordered it.&nbsp; Also, people get surprise packages from friends and family members.&nbsp; That&#039;s a pretty normal occurrence.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, isn&#039;t it plausible that a person would sign for an unknown package, assuming that they ordered something and forgot about it, or that a friend or family member sent them something?&nbsp; Both of these situations have actually happened to me many, many times.&nbsp; If I get a package, I always sign for it and take it, even if I genuinely have no clue what it is.<br /><br />Obviously this is not a problem if the package is small, but in the event that it&#039;s not, what do you do?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering about other types of mail services that require you to sign for the package.&nbsp; Like, if you use FedEx, or UPS, or even if you pick it up at the post office, don&#039;t you have to sign for it?&nbsp; If they won&#039;t hand it over to you unless you sign, what do you do?

				If its a controlled delivery. Its not going to fly. I didn&#039;t know anything about it. You just have to make sure the package isn&#039;t in your possession if a controlled delivery were to take place.

				I woul not worry to much about it, i never order something from here without it being signed for, to many thieves in the postal system for my liking.<br /><br />If it some thing you requested from an order from here rest assured the vendor wants you to get your goods intact, so there packaging should be first class or better.<br /><br />And yes say for instance you signed for something and 10-20 mins later there&#039;s a knock or your door just gets kicked in JUST deny it and say i just opened it up no idea what it is, i think its drugs officer i was just about to go to the police station and hand it over. Its up to them to prove anything, but it wont ever get that far, if anything your signed for package was poorly packaged warranting a closer inspection, and well unless your ordering kilos of stuff they wont bother with any thing under 8 ozs i know i got a love letter from them once saying they seized my goods from xxx weight xxx will be destroyed on xxx you have 30 days to come and collect dispute it.<br /><br />

				I do wish you &quot;newbies&quot; would put what country you live in ATM in the title of your thread, it would make it so much easier for us &quot;old timers&quot; to give you a relevant answer, since the law on drugs (No pun intended) is different from country to country.<br /><br />That said, I live in the UK, and anyone that lives at the delivery address can sign for a package, with no problem.<br />It is called &quot;unsolicited mail&quot; and means that anybody can send anything to anybody via the mail as long as there is no packing slips or other means of identification in or on the packet. <br />That is why some mail gets opened in the United States apparently, if the outside address is not legible they can open the package to look for a packing slip or invoice copy etc.<br />But I do believe the situation is different in some of the States of America and maybe Canada. The easiest way is to Google it, (or whatever search engine you use).<br />Just ask &quot;who can sign for a package delivered by [insert courier name] or post service.<br /><br />As you say, there is no way they can do anything until you have opened the package and look as if you are about to use it. And as for the so called &quot;controlled delivery&quot; - it would be far too expensive just to catch an end user with a few grams of whatever.<br /><br />&nbsp;Of course if you were importing a Kilo of coke or weed even, that maybe a different thing all together, but even then the authorities(Postal service, FedEX, LE etc) would have to synchronize their activities and it would probably standout.<br />&nbsp;If you knew which day or days to expect the delivery, just before you expect the delivery from the Postal worker, you could walk down the street/road and check out any dodgy looking car (brand new Nexus for example) or beaten up television repair van.<br />There is far too much paranoia about this, I have been doing this for 15 months and never had a problem) although there is always a first time (LOL) :)<br />Sorry about the length of this rant but it gets asked many times.
