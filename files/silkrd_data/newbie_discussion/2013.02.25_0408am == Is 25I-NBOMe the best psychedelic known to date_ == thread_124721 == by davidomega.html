				Is 25I-NBOMe the best psychedelic known to date? Or do you like other psychedelics better like 25C-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 5-MEO-MIPT, Allylescaline, Methylallylescaline, 2C-B-FLY, etc.<br /><br />I personally like 25I-NBOMe the best. Good visuals and great body feeling.

				ive had 25i-nbome and i dont know what all the hype is about.. it either doesnt effect me alot or the bioavalablity is shit. Ive tried it like 5 or 6 times and all it does to me is on the &quot;come up&quot; i get super horny and can orgasam like 4 times in a row if i want then i just feel a bit tense and have slight pschadelicness.. just tracers and wavy computer screen / words etc but never anything really more than that! only other psch ive had is mushrooms and those are an experience. If i was horny and wanted sex though i may use it for those come-up like effects but then ide feel tense for another 2 - 4 hours

				i have done acid, nbome and DMT, at least 5 - 6 times each.<br /><br />the LSD euphoria is missing in the nbomes<br />LSD visuals are different from nbome visuals, although i have not managed to get strong visuals on (supposedly) high doses of LSD.. just things breathing.<br />25i complexed tabs only made things wiggle for me. also, looking at the moon was fun.<br />25i/c combo tabs from tyler actually gave me some nice CEV<br /><br /><br />The mental high is much more pronounced on acid. Nbome&#039;s leave the control of your mind in tact ( at lower doses ), so you can still have a normal conversation with people, and socialise at a club n shit ( 1mg dose ). higher doses tend to make me paranoid. 3mg over the course of the night started getting me into a bad zone towards the end, but since it is relatively easy to handle, it was not as bad as it could have been had i done acid instead.<br /><br />DMT is on another level altogether.... i am still experimenting with it at present, but i did get some nice fractals, and got into a much more perceptive state. time &amp; space dilation(if thats the right word) is most noticeable on DMT..<br /><br />Please take care with your approach to DMT. Set and setting, as has been said many times before, is VERY important..<br />

				Having tried a relatively decent amount of different psychedelics, I found that 25I is my personal favorite.<br /><br />While it might nor be as pontent as LSD or shrooms, it just has a great feel to it that I&#039;ve come to love. My whole body feels like its been licked by cool flames, everything that touches me leaves me tingling. CEVs are nice but not overwhelming, but OEVs are just basic fractal patterns with a ton of light refraction.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t waste my time with small dosages. When my tolerance drops back down, I find 5.5mg does the trick. My first ever dose was 2.2mg but it was nothing special. The magic number for me is 11.1mg of 25I and my highest dosage was 19.8mg. I prefer complexed blotters. I&#039;m sure there was some variables I haven&#039;t accounted for but blotters I&#039;ve had that weren&#039;t complexed were a major disappointment in comparison. If I&#039;m gonna be buying 25i, it&#039;ll be from nawlins, love his shit!<br /><br />As for the mention of Allylescaline, its nice but not something I&#039;d go out of my way to find. Besides heightened emotions, it had nothing else going for it. When I was on it I felt great but I&#039;m sure it could also make you feel all mopey and worthless. <br /><br />This is just my personal preference and thoughts on it. Everyone reacts differently to substances. :)<br />

				The 25I NBOMe will soon disappear and be replaced by the new RC du jour.&nbsp; Numerous possible overdose deaths, no real data on human safety; I wouldn&#039;t touch the shit........LSD is the real thing. Virtually non-toxic, with a long, long history of safe use.&nbsp; I will eat shrooms if I want to giggle but if you want to see God, eat some clean acid.

				Does anyone else feel like conversations are difficult (moreso than on other psychs)? I enjoy 25i thoroughly, but getting words from my mind to come out of my mouth just seems impossible at times. Frustratingly so. <br /><br />It&#039;s really my biggest issue with it.

				Somebody correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I thought that the NBOMe had a low lethal dose, and affected everybody differently, like what would get somebody high might not work for others, and might kill somebody else. It&#039;s sounds like that might be a folk tale. I did read where this one guy accidentally killed his girlfriend and they charged him with murder, because he gave it to her, and then when she had problems he wouldn&#039;t call a ambulance <br />I heard that 2CB is good, Shulgin liked it, and it&#039;s hard to get more authority than that!

				Every drug treats everybody differently, but for my money nothing I&#039;ve done so far compares to LSD. As far as psyches go, I&#039;ve done LSD, 4-Aco-DMT, 2c-b, MDMA and 25i-nbome, and I&#039;d say overall 25i was only my third favorite after LSD and 2c-b (and don&#039;t get me started on the combo).<br /><br />25i is very visual and erotic, but I get body load from it and the overall experience is never as interesting or memorable as LSD. LSD makes the world new and alive in a way that 25i can&#039;t come close to. For me it&#039;s not the hallucinations that are important per se, but the way LSD magnifies my aesthetic experience of the world and makes everything burn with raw significance and meaning. <br /><br />25i is an interesting and sometimes even enlightening way to spend an afternoon, and it&#039;s nice to be able to work the remote control, but LSD will always be my home away from home.

				I think the NBOMes are too heavy on the vasoconstriction, whereby someone mistaking it for LSD and taking several hits can lose a limb or die. That&#039;s pretty worrying to me and it&#039;s awful how many dealers hand it out calling it LSD. Bless The Avengers for helping sort the good from the bad in that regard. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0 <br /><br />Lots of love for LSD, DMT, and 2C-B! It even rhymes!

				I&#039;m not a fan of 25i for the same reason others have said in this thread, the vasoconstriction and the strange stimulation. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a good handful of different psychedelics but by no means enough to be an expert on the matter, especially as one as subjective as &#039;best psychedelic&#039;.<br /><br />Personally though, I&#039;ve got a place in my heart for LSD and MDMA. Both seperately and the combination. <br /><br />In highschool LSD was easier to acquire for me than it is now IRL,which may have something to do with it, me and my buddy agree that most people usually love the first psychedelic they tried. I&#039;ve always had great times on LSD, the way it opens my mind and expands my perceptions. Its great. Things get hilarious pretty easily for me <br /><br />Mushrooms can be cool, but I&#039;m not as in control of the experience, which at times can be great, other times it can make it extremely disorienting, weird or awkward. <br /><br />The few times I&#039;ve done 2c-b it was usually pretty underwhelming. My buddy just gave me some out of the blue and i tried that batch at a festival and was blown away. A lot of my friends say its an amazing booster to LSD, and since I have some LSD saved up finally, I&#039;ll have to try that this Summer. <br /><br />MDMA is an obvious one, (although I wouldn&#039;t necessarily consider it a &#039;psychedelic&#039; in terms of drug classification)&nbsp; I&#039;m naturally a social guy, so MDMA makes me wanna go out and make a bunch of new friends, and when I&#039;m on MDMA i usually do. <br /><br />I hate the DOx&#039;s, had fun on em once at an old small festival i used to go to (R.I.P Camp Zoe) got sold DOC as acid, me an a friend spent the next 14 hours running around the property with LED swords doing battle and conquesting with other hippies. So i guess they CAN be fun, but in a normal home setting, I&#039;ve never fallen in love with em, although I have had some extremely intense trips off &#039;em. <br /><br /><br /><br />All in all, I&#039;ve learned that drugs are awesome

				The vasoconstriction and the stimulation are minor issues comparing to the overwhelming benefits and long lasting therapeutic effects, not to mention the inspiration 25i gives you!..

				Can anyone vouch for those Tyler tab 1200ug nBOMe? I&#039;ve never hallucinated before (besides ambien......) and i chose to only get 5 of them because they seemed incredibly cheap and I really have no idea what I&#039;m buying. Help :|

				I&#039;ve only ever done acid, shrooms, and foxy, and I enjoy all 3.<br />I am very interested in trying 2C-B.<br />Kind of interested in 25i but it seems everyone has mixed reviews...maybe eventually.

				@danknasty:<br />5-MeO-DiPT, lots of people say it&#039;s a little like MDMA and shrooms put together. I would agree for the most part, but I do find it a little more relaxed. Good to do with a SO.

				Personally I prefer 25i on 1200ug tabs, but as mentioned previously, drugs, especially psychedelics effect everyone differently :)&nbsp;

				Love 25i!! My mates do too!! I get these in sheets of 900 and give them out to my mates cause they are so cheap! Make great money too cause they so cheap but I always make sure I tell people they are not LSD strickly cause I also find them heavy on the bodys breathing function and dont want this shit falling back on me. High school and University students flock to grab this off me, I struggle to get enough of it in!

				As of right now, I&#039;ve had the most amazing trips on 25i. It&#039;s been so colorful, and spending hours looking at the stars. Watching them shake, melt, disappear and reappear in a new location while an aurora calmly waves across the cross. I&#039;ve had only beautiful experiences. I&#039;d say I&#039;ve tripped on 25i at least a dozen times, and each time was just as amazing as the first. However, I can definitely feel the effects on my brain. I forget shit constantly, almost every morning I wake up and everything is waving like I was tripping, constant lights shooting across my vision, and sometimes when I speak I lose my thoughts and quickly forget about what I was even saying in the first place. I remember experiencing ego death on about the third trip while me and this girl were staring at a map of the world posted on the ceiling. I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve really been the same since tripping on 25i

				Booms<br />Acid<br />&nbsp;<br />(i am assuming) DMT (but ive never tried it...cant wait)<br /><br />then RC&#039;s and bombs <br />but ive tried <br />25-i it was really strong nothing i couldnt handle but LSD and shrooms are just so much more eye-opening and spirtitual <br /><br />bombs are heavy and &#039;primitive&#039; idk drugs are pretty tricky to describe :/

				25I is good, I&#039;ve got 90 hits in my pocket that will be gone in a few days im sure.&nbsp; Personally I prefer LSD over it but most people like 25I more.&nbsp; It seems to last a little shorter which most people like but not me.&nbsp; DMT is my favorite psychodelic though, cant wait to try it IV haha
