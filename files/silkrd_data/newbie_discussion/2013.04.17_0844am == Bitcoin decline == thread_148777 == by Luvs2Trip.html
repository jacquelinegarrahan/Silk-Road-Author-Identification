				At the moment the value of the bitcoin is decreasing rapidly! How will the sellers with pending transactions deal with this? Surely sellers are going to lose a lot of money! Other than lose money the only other thing they can do is hold on to the bitcoins in a hope that it starts to go back the other way, but that is a gamble.

				I bought a product 18 days ago when 1 bitcoin was about 70 USD. In the days after it, the BC price raise to over 200 USD.

He sold my BC as quick as he could and made a 200% profit. IF HE FUCKED UP, he kept the bitcoin and lost alot of money on the crash. We don&#039;t give vendors our money to speculate with it, we give them our money so they can convert it into real money asap and get us our product.

				1. Vendors can hedge.<br />2. The trend has favoured vendors for many many months now.<br />3. The margins and markups vendors have cover even the most severe bitcoin devaluing, especially considering they can hold on to the coin till prices re-stabilize.<br /><br />The same cannot be said for buyers. Vendors have all the protection. Buyers bear all the risk.<br /><br />-CR<br />For the People.

				Offcourse, bitcoin is one of the most unstable markets, but it&#039;s also a new and very small market. Vendors must me aware of this. So if they don&#039;t unload there bitcoin asap, they should know they can get burned.&nbsp; One of the reasons bitcoin was created was so that digital transactions could take place anonymously. <br /><br />If people are gonna start using the bitcoin currency for &quot;investment&quot; or start &quot;speculating&quot; with it, things are gonna go bad very very fast. Bitcoin is suppose to be the answer to the CRAZY stuff the regulated monetary system or banks in general are doing resulting in an worldwide economic crisis.&nbsp; At the moment, clearly some people have been buying high amounts of bitcoin to artificially create a bubble, and no, it weren&#039;t the people in Cyprus (Doesn&#039;t make any sense). At the time the bubble was created, the people in Cyprus their bank accounts was locked and could only withdraw very small amounts on money daily (I think 100USD). There are some big players involved doing this; seems obvious.
