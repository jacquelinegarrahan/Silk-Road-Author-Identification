				Hi guys<br />I am kinda newbie<br />last 3-4 weeks searching SR<br />and forum like<br />along with regular broswers<br />My main problem atm is how to acess quite fast bitcoins<br />any suggestions or sites&gt;?<br />I tried several of them, but all results were disapointing for me<br />1st tried bitcoin.de quite reputable<br />but needs 3 days like till u link your account with your bank account and verify<br />then i wanted by bitcoins from there (using escroow system) so i bought them and spend some euro<br />but bank transfers usually make 2-5 days ( i am at day 5 now and its saturday... lets hope for Monday..)<br />Then since i am new account and 1st transaction, i cant use that bitcoins... untill a period of 15 days pass (that happens only 1st time for security reasons..&nbsp; yeah lol i have in total for like 26 days minimum??)<br />tried bitcurex but seems their site isnt really functional, tried with 3 diferent broswers make account, at different times also<br />with real email adresses, but i never received email verification.. (only when i testsed with a fake email generators email it worked..)<br />Then heard bitmit, had seen some bitcoins offers near the amount i want and through paypal also..<br />so i went back to mine old paypal account, had to verify the new card i use ( 2-3 extra days)<br />posted offer to buy bitcoins for mine euro through paypal..<br />but seems, from what i also read on forums, no1 trusts paypal transactions, since paypal dont recognise digital curencies, and some1 can easy exploit it..<br />local bitcoin dealers sell at really high prices, <br /><br /><br />So wtf guys?<br />Any fast way?<br />I just want buy few bitcoins like 0.5-0.8 so test SR for start...<br />but days passing without sucess<br /><br />Seems bitcoins problem is that one..<br />U cant find some secure fast way buy bitcoins<br /><br /><br />Anyone have to propose some site? or some FAST way? (hopefully with debit/credit card i guess, or paypal[but i guess no1 trusts it..])<br /><br />Thanks guys for reading that

				Ya, buy local, get an exchange at a bank (highly unlikely you&#039;ll get tracked just with security footage), or make a deposit to a bitcoin dealers account. <br />I wouldn&#039;t trust any other method. Buying local seems to be the safest - though the last dude I bought from was way sketch.

				You can use localbitcoins without leaving your seat as long as you have a phone and a computer. I&#039;d avoid meeting a stranger who knows exactly how much money i&#039;m carrying for a face to face buy.
