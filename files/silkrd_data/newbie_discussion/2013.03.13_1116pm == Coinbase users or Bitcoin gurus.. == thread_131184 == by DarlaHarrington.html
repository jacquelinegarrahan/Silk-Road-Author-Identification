				So I have a question. I used coinbase to buy bitcoins. It took a week to clear but as soon as it cleared I put it in my Blockchain wallet and sent it off to SR. This morning I get an email from Coinbase saying the purchase has been reversed. I already used and made purchases so what happens now?&nbsp; I&#039;m so confused.

				It seems legit and you go through a long process to link your account. The email said the bank reversed it due to it not being an account. I still have the money in my bank account and I already used the bitcoins. So I&#039;m just confused as to how they can get ther coins back. I want to pay them legitimately.

				I think they have a certain amount of coins sold each day. So I&#039;m not sure you can purchase any at the moment.

				I have been using Coinbase for quite a while now.&nbsp; Never had a single issue with em.&nbsp; They sell you BTC, buy your BTC, transfer your currencies for you.&nbsp; The only downside to them is the waiting period.&nbsp; Sure you can can buy and sell instantly at the current market price, but you then have to wait their mandatory 3 to 4 days holding period before they release the BTC or USD over to you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trust me, if you get yourself on a schedule of set days a week designated to your trading habits, it makes it so much easier and a whole lot less stressful.&nbsp; There&#039;s no trying to get that last BTC at the last minute buy running all over town making bank deposits, western union transfers, money grams, etc.&nbsp; No more WU fees, ATM fees, and all those fees you don&#039;t even think about when your scrambling around desperately trying to get that coin,&nbsp; I just sit back and relax knowing I can take comfort in the fact my BTCs will be here when I need them.<br /><br />To top it all off, you can link your bank account info with the site.&nbsp; The fees are pretty painless as well.&nbsp; I am sure of the exact % they charge, but it&#039;s either &gt; = 1% or &lt; = 1.6%.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, the only time they have issues is when there are blockchain problems.&nbsp; And when those occur, everyone&#039;s down.&nbsp; They do put a cap on your spending at first.&nbsp; They limit the amount of BTC you can purchase in one day to 10 BTC.&nbsp; After like 2 weeks (might have been less) it goes up to 100 BTC per day.&nbsp; <br /><br />So if you have a little bit of patience, throw some coins at em.&nbsp; See what happens.

				So I basically got free bitcoins? Once they&#039;re in the SR wallet can Coinbase take them&nbsp; back? That&#039;s what I&#039;m worried about. I ordered some more stuff on SR, I don&#039;t want to fuck over a vendor.

				&quot;To top it all off, you can link your bank account info with the site.&quot; use account for bitcoin purchases only?
