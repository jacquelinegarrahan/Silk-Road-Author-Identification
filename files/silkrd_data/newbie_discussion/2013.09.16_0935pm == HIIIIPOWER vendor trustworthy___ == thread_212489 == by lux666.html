				Bump for interest.<br /><br />I am also looking for any info on HIIIPOWER, particularly whether FE is required. I&#039;m inclined to trust them personally; good stats, long-time seller, good reviews - but it&#039;s not my money but a friend&#039;s so I&#039;m not really in any kind of position to lose it. However, for my shopping list he is the very best candidate, and with 7 months presence with an overwhelmingly large proportion of 5/5 to other ratings, I&#039;m probably going to go with them.<br /><br />So, I just talked myself into trusting them.

				I am waiting a week now. Didn&#039;t FE of course (remember this: you Never FE).<br />Apart from all the FEs with no updates there is a problem of logic. The vendor asks for FE because he &quot;wants to keep good stock&quot; but then he says that he uses a private network for his shipping. The last part doesnt make sense, you dont have a network and then need like 20â‚¬ units to buy new product.<br />I think Hipower is GGatz, he used the same &quot;I have my people&quot; line.<br /><br />My tip: Wait with this guy until it&#039;s cleared in one or the other way.<br /><br />cu<br /><br />Jardallah

				His transaction meter rised from 155 to 248 within just the last 10 days and there is not a single positive feedback. Recently he added some big amount listings on top, so its pretty obvious whats going on there, isnt it!?! I bet he will disapear in a few days with all FEd Btc.<br />
