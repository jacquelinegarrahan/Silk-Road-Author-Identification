				is basically like meeting someone on a street corner (that you dont know) but has heard from someone that its legit, and giving them money to walk into an apartment building to go &quot;get your shit.&quot;&nbsp; If you wouldnt do it in that instance (and i hope you wouldnt) why would you do it on here?&nbsp; When theres possibly 1000&#039;s of miles between you and the connect?&nbsp; <br />Although one thing I have seen is vendors REQUIRING FE ....which sucks because usually these vendors prices are really fucking good....which is a whole nother debate.

				personally i would never fe. that is what escrow is for, it safeguards you from a vendor going rogue or not sending it. start off small,go domestic and pay as soon as you get the item.then your stats should speak for themselves and if a vendor asks you to fe find another one.

				Hey as in everything we are supposed to read as newbs it says Do Not Finalize Early! And as long as your escrow is hedged it is locked to the dollar value of what you are buying until you finalize so no surprises for either you or the seller. Go buy some shit from people who don&#039;t require FE, once your stats are up then most drop it unless your stats suck...<br /><br />mushmold

				That is a good point django, find another vendor, I think as SR grows this will become more popular, I think SR still has a lot of untapped potential and needs more vendors, more competition.<br /><br />YoungnReckless the vendor who I mentioned in the last post was actually referred to me by another vendor (after studying both of there messages I was convinced it was the same person) <br />But I think this will get less popular as the community are becoming smarter and quicker at recognizing scams. <br />Having said that check out what just recently happened with the vendor Slicksuit http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101907.90<br />This guy had fake forum handles who had many posts and a lot of karma!

				I was just also wondering about something else when mushmold mentioned &quot;hedged.&quot;&nbsp; I placed two orders Monday night.&nbsp; One was hedged, and the other wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; If the escrow is not hedged, that means the vendor is obligated to take the loss or gain from market fluctuation?&nbsp; I guess I should re-read that part, eh?&nbsp; :)

It works in your favour when the market is being bullish like at the moment.<br /><br />Sorry to answer your question more clearly, yes the vendor is obligated to take the loss or gain from the market fluctuation, but you are also obligated to as well if you are to receive a refund.

				wait what?<br /><br />I skipped all the replies after the OP, but basically what you said is &quot;FE is bad ... it&#039;s like trusting and giving your money to a stranger and asking them to go into a building and get your stuff for you... unless the seller says they require FE and the prices are really good ... so in that case, trust the stranger&quot;<br /><br />??????

				django, I am still very skeptical about him. and do believe that he is a scammer. <br />Like I mentioned, the people who said they had received have very bland previous posts, and almost a similar writing style, There is no real questions or personalisation. I find it all rather fake.<br />The deal is very very very (too?) good (with extra samples of coke as well!!!) I have been scammed before, this feels just like it. Both my nervous systems are going off.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, If you think my points are invalid then come refute them. I really do hope people get there orders from him.

				FE is for 2 types of vendors. Small timers that can&#039;t float money properly to do business here and scammers. I don&#039;t use FE but wasn&#039;t offering refunds or reships for a time while the USPS rules were being figured out. If you stick to good vendors and don&#039;t FE for a &quot;special sale&quot; like the last two cut n run scams you will be fine.

				Don&#039;t FE for more money than you are willing to lose.&nbsp; However, even people with good stats will FE for the right vendors and things often work out.&nbsp; FE is more needed if the vendor doesn&#039;t offer tracking.&nbsp; One solution: use a vendor that offers tracking and doesn&#039;t require FE.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to sign for an international package then often you need to get the package untracked unfortunately.

				I&#039;ve been on both sides of the equation. As a vendor, I don&#039;t ask buyers to FE but I also will not sell to someone with bad purchasing stats. I&#039;m a very small time vendor and I am constantly having buyers trying to scam me, do deals outside of SR, claiming orders did not arrive when I have delivery verification. Buyers can be real scum.<br /><br />But so can the vendors. I use a different account to buy and have only made a few purchases so I don&#039;t have too many horrible stories but the one time I FE&#039;d I nearly got burned. Luckily SR admins ran the bastard off before he made off with my money. Got every penny back and learned a valuable lesson - NEVER FE. Read up on your vendor before making a purchase. Never before have buyers had so much data available about their dealer. Make sure you take advantage of it.

				How did you FE and then get your money back through SR staff?&nbsp; If that happened then that is exceptionally rare.&nbsp; People that FE should 100% expect zero help from SR staff.

				This is the unpopular opinion, I know, but I am okay with FE when the seller is established and the customer is new. As far as legal risk, sellers bear the brunt, and the alternative would probably be that it would be very hard to find sellers willing to sell to new users.
