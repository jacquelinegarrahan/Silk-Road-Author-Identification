				If he says to you that he shipped it, then he shipped it and just wait for the package.<br />Talk to him about it, its both of you business to have this transaction fast and smooth.

				Always read vendor&#039;s page before you order. If a vendor asks newbs to FE then either FE of don&#039;t order. If your vendor requires you to FE they wont ship the order until you do. Do your research on vendors. Ask around on forums. <br />It&#039;s easy to fake feedback. ~90% of buyers who get scammed are newbs. Honestly though if you get scammed because you didn&#039;t bother to do some research before you give your address to a stranger who promises to send you drugs in the mail you deserve it.<br /><br />Tell me who&#039;s the vendor and I&#039;ll give you some info if I know them

The majority of scams happen when people finalize early. If you place an order and you have already finalized there is nothing that the SR admins can do about it if the package does not show up.

It means the seller is new and is not allowed to ask you to finalize early.<br /><br />In other words the seller is BREAKING THE RULES for being a seller on SR. He is not allowed to ask you to finalize early at all if he is under a certain number of sales. And like caerus said, it is easy to fake feedback. I suspect you might be about to get scammed.

Neither of you can do anything. The site does this intentionally.

				That&#039;s why then. He did not process the order yet. If you wait 24hrs time he should be done and you should be able to finalize.

				You,re convinced he,s a good vendor but if i was you i search for a vendor who allow you to use escrow!!!<br />it,s awful if you get a first neg experience so follow previously mentioned advises/instructions,be wise!<br />Never finalize early Sr support can,t help you after this and escrow is your protection.<br /><br />

Well&nbsp; maby it,s a red flag country and now your order is processing when he ships ```in transit``` appear,hope you understand..<br />and what i saw on Frank M profile he requires everybody to fe and is a very busy vendor who gets more than 100 msg a day,hmm at least he say<br />so wait till you see in transit or wait a few days and cancel your order!!! (option appear after 4 days)and try someone else who allows escrow and&nbsp; is less busy... ;) good luck
