				Hey man, I&#039;ve got 25 25i NBOMe blotters coming, should come by this week! I&#039;m in Malaysia and I&#039;ve already made 3 ordered that successfully came (even one of them was a FE but i&#039;ll never FE again just to be cautious) Anyways... I&#039;m preeeetyyyy sure you&#039;ll be fine, If you&#039;re getting blotters especially, they&#039;re really easy to conceal in a letter and sending loads of them shouldn&#039;t be an issue! <br /><br />If i were you, i&#039;d take the chance anyways, Its like the least riskiest drug to get, same goes with LSD, but its a bit pricey and I&#039;m a scumbag and wanted 25 blotters of 25i NBOMe since it will last longer and its cheap as fuck compared to it! <br /><br />Anyways, best of luck to the both of us, hope our deliveries are successful!
