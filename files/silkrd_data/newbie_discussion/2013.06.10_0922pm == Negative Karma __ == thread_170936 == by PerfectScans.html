				I would give you a karma bump, but I don&#039;t seem to be able to. It might be from your high volume of posts.

You need to have over a hundred posts I think. I don&#039;t like getting negative karma just because someone doesn&#039;t agree with me. But thats the brakes here.

				don&#039;t mind it. i&#039;ve seen a few smart and thoughtful posters who have negative karma. and i know you have a good reputation over at BMR. just do business as you do there and you&#039;ll be fine.(at least on the mainpage)<br />karma is just like it&#039;s on reddit, say what the mob likes and you get showered with upvotes. say something someone doesn&#039;rt like and you&#039;ll get&nbsp; negative karma from him and if you&#039;re unlucky from some idiots who just jump on the bandwaggon.and complaining about it usually makes it worse<br /><br />edit: wording

Assholes will be assholes. There is no rule about dishing out karma. The only people who really care about karma are newbies. The people who understand how things work here don&#039;t give a shit. Once you reach you&#039;re 50 posts you can post elsewhere, it makes sense right? It gives you a chance to learn forum rules and gain some momentum. Besides, newbie forum is the most active one.

				I have no idea where I got my bad karma from. Even when I spammed my first 50 posts, I wrote something usable in the vast majority of them. Like a fun fact or something. But hey... I guess ppl. just have a bad day sometimes, and wants to see the world burn.
