				They&#039;re in stealth mode right now trying to catch up it seems.&nbsp; People are still receiving orders I just think the supply cant keep up with the demand.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had an order processing since Monday, hope they can fill my prescription soon.

				I messaged him for the first time yesterday to see how things were going since it was still in processing and never got a reply.&nbsp; Now later today it was marked in transit but still didn&#039;t reply.&nbsp; If his username says anything about his location there is no reason why it shouldn&#039;t be here very soon.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update if and when.
