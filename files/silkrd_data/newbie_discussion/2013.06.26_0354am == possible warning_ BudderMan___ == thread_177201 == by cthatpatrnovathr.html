				The chemicals in your cannabis which get you high are called cannabinoids. There are hundreds of them and they each have their own effects. THC is the compound which creates a large majority of the high. Wen buds are first picked THCa is on them which is unusable by our cannabinoid receptors. This can be converted to nice and bioavailable THC by curing, decarbing, or committing the cannabis to other processes in order to bring out it&#039;s &quot;full potential&quot;.<br /><br />BudderMan is not a scammer. I think that $100 for something this potent is not a bad deal at all.<br /><br />Also please fully do research before accusations begin to fly. Maybe try asking the vendor himself about the validity of his processes, 99% of silk road vendors are very friendly.
