				Hey there all<br /><br />Just wanted to post a review of my order with Tweetb.<br /><br />So a couple weeks ago I decide to try ordering from Tweetb as I have read some rather nice reviews about his &quot;medicinal cannabis&quot;.<br /><br />I decide to go with a 1/4 at first just to see what&#039;s up with Tweetb&#039;s operation and product. Everything is &quot;top shelf&quot; cannabis from what I had read so I ordered a slice of Cheese and a slice of Maui Maui.<br /><br />My order was processed fast, communication was stellar and the delivery was stealth and fast. Good signs so far.<br /><br />Now for the herb. Just awful. Both stains were literally dirt. No trichome development at all on the maui, and the cheese was definitely kief&#039;d. Both were very old and looked as if they were rolled thru dirt then shipped. The Cheese was also moldy and a lot of the nugs were burnt. With that said, how could these be potent? They just can&#039;t and weren&#039;t. I tossed the 1/4 in the garbage about an hour after delivery. <br /><br />So naturally I contact Tweetb. I made it very clear that I wasn&#039;t looking for a handout at this point, but that I was just completely dissatisfied w/ their product and that I only ordered because of what I read on the reviews and on Tweetb&#039;s vendor page. I smoke good cannabis, I thought I would just try Tweetb for the variety; but medicinal cannabis is what it is, medcinal, very potent, kind nuggets, beautiful all around, loved all the way through to the end......there is no room anything less when advertising &quot;medicinal&quot; or high quality.<br /><br />Anyway, I contact Tweetb telling them of my extreme displeasure with the product and they message me back a couple days later. They tell me that I am correct and that others have complained; that the cannabis was not top shelf (they only specifically named the maui which was then lowered in price on the vendor page, tho both the cheese and maui were equally as bad) and that a new supplier was used this time and it was not up to Tweetb&#039;s high standards. Shit, I understand things get fucked up once in a while, it is the black market....but why send that shit out at all? Without even smoking it anyone with even the slightest knowledge of marijuana could see that it was straight schwag...<br /><br />So Tweetb is telling me I can pretty much choose whatever and they&#039;ll send it out to me no cost. Very cool, wasn&#039;t expecting that. Like I said, despite the awful herb, Tweetb was definitely very responsive throughout this all and wanted to fix this and do the right thing, which I absolutely respect. (Mind you, I still gave the 5/5 for the great communication and delivery)<br /><br />At this point I am very hesitant to try any other herb of theirs, but shit, I&#039;m out $120 at this point so I tell Tweetb to just send me a 1/4 of the very best quality cannabis product they have; whether it be other strains they have or their famous bubble hash. They respond and tell me the herb inventory is low and old so they send me 9g of their bubble hash. Awesome, 2g&#039;s extra is definitely a nice gesture as is all hash. I am still weary but excited at the same time to see what their bubble is all about.<br /><br />The hash arrives promptly and 9g&#039;s of Tweetb&#039;s bubble it is. Ha, man. I hate to say it but the hash sucks. Seriously, it&#039;s just not good. Despite it not bubbling, it smells of like minty menthol nasty trim or something. It is not as bad as the maui waui or cheese they sent me but still not smokeable for a person that is used to smoking high quality marijuana. Sucks. Texture is semi soft, black/dark brown color, doesn&#039;t melt at all and the taste is gross like the smell.<br /><br />Of course I have to message Tweetb just to let them know. As always I am very nice/professional. I just stated my displeasure once again and that obviously we have different opinions of what high quality cannabis is and that I don&#039;t want anything else but that I will still check out their vendor page to see if they ever post real quality cannabis. I also stated how I respected them for doing the right thing and trying to fix the situation, $120 is a lot to throw away tho.<br /><br />Just letting others know of my experience with Tweetb, and that I do think they mean well and want to supply people with high quality cannabis products; but sending out just anything will not cut it.<br /><br />\\\\Turtle11

				I am fairly new here and have been sampling some hash here on SR. I have a strain of weed that I am very happy with. I just received some OG Kush Bubble from&nbsp; tweetb on thursday and I have to say the stuff is really good. Looking at it under the 10x loupe it is nice clumpy crystals and you could smell that kush smell. I did see that there was some leftover ash in the bowl when I burned it but very little and yes it really did not bubble. I am sure it was ice hash, years ago it was explained to me by my dutch friend when the whole bubble /ice hash thing took off and that the clippings from certain strains would not bubble and were less desirable because the coffee shops were marketing it as bubble hash not ice hash, maybe it was a strain that does not bubble out?.&nbsp; I understand you first received some bad weed and this was even listed as a known issue, Like I said I am very new and I am not saying that I have any knowledge of the logistics of operating here on SR as a vendor but it sure sounds like the vendor tried to make it right. All that being said I also purchased some B grade ice hash from Northcalkindness and that was the mid range and it did disappear in the&nbsp; screen , I can only say when they advertise full melt as their top of the line that may be on lines of what you are looking for in terms of a melt or bubble hash.I will try some on my in next inevitable next order.&nbsp; I have also tried some pollen hash here from heartofhumbolt&nbsp; that was really nice too. Pressed Keif in a coin very smooth and nice,up high. Priced right and smokes smooth. Out of stock but I will reorder when i see it again.
