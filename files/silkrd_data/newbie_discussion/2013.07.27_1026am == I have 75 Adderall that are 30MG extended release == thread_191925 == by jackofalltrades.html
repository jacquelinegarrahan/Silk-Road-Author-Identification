				Best bet is wait till you&#039;ve paid for a seller account, that way you will get positive ratings for selling them. You might need to send out one or two as free samples first before people trust you.

				I&#039;d recommend selling these IRL and using the funds from those sales to purchase your seller account.&nbsp; Adderall fetches a decent price on the street, especially around college campuses.&nbsp; Source:&nbsp; Have multiple friends in college who fiend for the stuff every now and then and pay through the nose for it.
