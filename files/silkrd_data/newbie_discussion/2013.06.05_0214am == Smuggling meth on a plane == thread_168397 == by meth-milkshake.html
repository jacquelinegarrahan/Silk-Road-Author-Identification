				I know this isn&#039;t the right forum for this, but I don&#039;t want to deal with spamming to 50 at the moment.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how safe it people think it would be to stow a personal amount of meth (half a gram to a gram) on checked luggage while leaving the United States and flying into Central America (no meth for the return trip back to the US)? My current idea is to crush the meth into a powder, distribute it into 10-15 size 00 capsules and then fill the capsules to the top with creatine or baking soda (or some other inconspicuous white powder). It would of course then be put in a &quot;sealed&quot; container (not MBB, but something air tight). Is there a better way to do this, or am I asking to get fucked in federal prison for 20 years?

				Interesting first question. Using 00 is a good idea, but i could recommend investing in colored caps, even better if you could imitate a legit prescription or generic over the counter pill. Then stow it with your toiletries, if anyone looks they will find a completely normal bag with normal items. And you would definitely want a filler to reduce the movement inside the pills as it would be odd. Thats what i would do, have never actually tried this before.

				DO NOT CHECK DRUGS IN LUGGAGE!<br /><br />It is far safer to carry any substance on you.&nbsp; Airport security can open your luggage after you check it.&nbsp; Dogs are more likely to be sniffing the checked bags and not in the terminal (I don&#039;t know if it is legal for dogs to smell check passengers though I have seen them in the passenger areas).<br /><br />Your pill idea is one I use frequently.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; A pill bottle, especially for a prescription medication or even a nutritional supplement will do. Have a couple of different pill bottles for vitamins, meds, etc. You can even empty out some of whatever is in the capsules of the bottle you are using and fill it with your shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep it with your other toiletries in your carry on. <br /><br />With the introduction of the full x-ray machines, storing any substance on your person is not advised.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about traveling internationally.&nbsp; I have only done this domestically, but have been successful with this technique several times.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bon Voyage!&nbsp;

				Be advised those god dam body scanners will pick up any kind of hidden cavity you may try to hide it in. Most major cities now have those god dam things so I wouldn&#039;t go that root.

				Would keeping it on you versus putting it in your bag that gets X-rayed make a difference? Does anyone know if meth turns up somehow different on X-ray than other supplements (such as creatine)? If so, that&#039;d be a huge red flag, is there something legal that would show up similar enough to meth to pass through unnoticed? Definitely put it in toiletries bag and definitely be sure to remove anything and everything from your bag that may get your bag double checked (liquids, metals, electronics). I&#039;ve flown out of the US before and I don&#039;t remember them putting me through additional security checks (although maybe they do it randomly?) but I know that flying from Mexico back into the US they did random security checks on people.
