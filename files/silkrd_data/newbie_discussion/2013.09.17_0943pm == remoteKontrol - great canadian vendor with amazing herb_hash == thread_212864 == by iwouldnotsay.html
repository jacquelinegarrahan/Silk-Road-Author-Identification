				Hi,<br /><br />Trying to get my post numbers up as I am currently using a new name other than my username on SR. (Dummy)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve purchased from RK about 5 times now. First his hash - then his weed.<br />His hash is the best I&#039;ve ever smoked. It is very potent and clean burning. <br /><br />It is soft and pliable yet dense and very strong weed/thc flavour rather than the earthy-ness I&#039;m used to locally.<br /><br />His Hempstar weed is very much some of the stronger stuff available on the road.<br />I&#039;ve tried Canadaflag (good homegrown rarities), greenworks (good G-13 hybrid love potion very unique sativa feel and amazing HQ bubble totally gummy hash tastes so good and burns like HQ oil almost.) Mr Ouid (too many threads about his pot - its good and expensive except in high qty), beachcomber (unbelievable quality, high tech stuff, lots of options, pretty expensive ever since the Mt Gox price issue)<br />annnnnd.... RK&#039;s Hempstar really trumps them all. It gets you very high, much higher than even the best purple kush that i&#039;ve smoked off the road from beachcomber. <br /><br />Buut unlike canadaflag&#039;s Satori (which you can just keep smoking and get yourself dizzy high)<br />&nbsp;- you cannot smoke more than one joint a day due to the fact that the burnout is heavy and prevents me from feeling the high later - maybe after a long nap it works though.<br /><br />I like to switch around all day with my herb intake (i smoke about 4g a day slowly all day) <br />It works well with my drawing and painting regiment:) <br /><br />He also always throws in a free gift - i&#039;ve received 2 tabs of MDA, 2 grams of hash, a gummy (i think it is THC forgot to ask him)<br /><br /><br />
