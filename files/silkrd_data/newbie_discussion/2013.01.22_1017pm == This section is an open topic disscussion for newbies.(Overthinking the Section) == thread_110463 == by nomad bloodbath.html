				You guys are using this section to spam post your account to post in various sections of the forum, when you should just use this section to submit and answer questions, I don&#039;t understand why everyone thinks they have to have 50 posts to ask a question or submit a review.<br />You guys should just use this section as an all topic discussion instead of laboriously trying to reach 50 posts for no real reason.<br />Submit your questions in this section moderators will more than likely be answering the questions and you cant really get better answers from anyone than the moderators.<br />You guys are working too hard to do what you could do with your first post.<br />Wanna know about anything, then just ask.<br />It&#039;s simple, don&#039;t over think this, just act like a normal section.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Might I suggest to the vendors in this section to start using their posts to answer newbie questions and you guys can even setup bewbie section vendor reviews and thread here instead of wasting your time with post boosting. Why not get your new customers from the new members.<br />Seems no brainer to get grassroots new customers.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Agreed.&nbsp; Take advantage of this time to search on the forum, ask questions, try to help each other, and make this subforum a worthwhile, welcoming place.&nbsp; It&#039;s here to stay, so instead of complaining about it, why not make the best of it?

It means we can&#039;t add reviews to the most logical place for others to find them (either the vendor&#039;s own thread, or on a consolidated thread like Avengers LSD thread).<br /><br />It&#039;s not a case of us not realising we can&#039;t ask a question or post a review here, rather that we understand -perfectly well- that the best place to ask a question is in relevant main forum, and the best place to post a review is on a vendor&#039;s review thread, and we&#039;re attempting to do that as quickly as possible to work around these spammer-imfluenced restrictions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110463.msg753260#msg753260">Quote from: nomad bloodbath on January 22, 2013, 10:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You guys should just use this section as an all topic discussion instead of laboriously trying to reach 50 posts for no real reason.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are very real reasons to reach 50 posts, namely that it will open up a vastly wider audience for questions and discussion, and help keep the boards better organised by ensuring reviews and discussions are in their logical place, not split half-and-half between their correct place, and an unorganised catch-all Newbie subforum.<br /><br />Really, I understand why you&#039;ve introduced this posting requirement, in order to give yourselves some breathing space to try to fend off the spammers, but please try to recognise it for what it is - a very blunt instrument brought in as an emergency until a better solution can be found. Which I hope you do! ;D

				Well filling this section with useless spam post for username boost post is not the right way to use this area and if it doesnt start being used in a productive manner it&#039;s gonna get some rules that make it even harder.<br />Most forums that use this type of section would allow boost posts a to reach the required posts to move on from the section.<br /><br />This is a new section I see no reason why there can&#039;t be vendor reviews by newbs here as well as the rumor mill, it&#039;s not like there not gonna be a constant new crop of newbs that could use info in this section help them rather than this pointless fodder of crap posts. This is a new born section so of course it&#039;s gonna need a little time to become organized and setup to be just as useful as the other sections of the forum...treating it like a punishment for being new is not the way to look at it. Why not create threads yopu can leave behind to grow as a legacy, Like FAQ&#039;s on certain subjects that new members and browse as a location to answers everyone have when first getting into the forum community.<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m just telling you guys that this current spam boosting post crap is gonna be a limited thing soon it&#039;s gonna be phased out because this is also to slow the increase of throw away shrill accounts as well in the forum that creates all kinds of deception in feedback and review threads in the rumor mill. It&#039;s only currently be allowed because it was put into place without anyone given in warning.<br />This section isnt just for the btc spammers but for slowing down several issues that plague the community.<br /><br />I want everyone to understand that the answers you get here are gonna be from the most knowledgeable in the community. As long as ppl say this is a useless section than that&#039;s how many will think but in reality it&#039;s far from useless and can be very much a great section for easing into the way things work around here and the do&#039;s and don&#039;t for new members. I believe posts in this section are just as important as posts in any other section. We reap what we sow. <br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				I am actually pretty upset about this.&nbsp; THE only reason i joined SR was because whatever i was getting got too difficult to obtain.&nbsp; Ive been submitting reviews and posting comments in the Avengers LSD review thread and the offical lsd review thread...a few days ago i realized that i couldnt post anything and was not aware of this new rule.&nbsp; I had no way of knowing what was going on and when going to support there was no helpful info.&nbsp; i understand your reason for doing this but it should have been made aware to all users via PM to let them know before they go reinstalling software and checking settings for hours.

				ok so i can encrypt/decrypt messages thus i can communicate with vendors, however, i now need to put some btc in my account. do i have the next steps right? (i know there are several sites offering these services -btc conversion, btc wallet- so ill just go through the way i understand things currently- download electrum the wallet; create an account on mt. gox to convert my currency to btc, send these btc to my electrum wallet address, send the btc from here to my SR account address, at this point i will have funds, and am ready to buy?<br />thanks a bunch for any guidance

				Maybe it&#039;s my age I don&#039;t know maybe it&#039;s because I had t use my street smart&#039;s for 10+ years as a dependant heroin user but it seem&#039;s to me that alot of people really shouldn&#039;t be here I dont meen to cause offence to anybody and appologise if I do but when I see post&#039;s about people worrying about having post come to they&#039;re mum&#039;s house it make&#039;s me wonder what the average age is,I dont care to be honest aslong as you have some common sense,and although I do think nomad came off a bit strong I totally get where your coming from,it must be a pain in the arse especially having to delete all the verwex crap I know it&#039;s getting on my nerve&#039;s, aswell as seeing thread&#039;s being made for thing&#039;s such as where to get btc and have I been ripped off because its been 10 mins since buying my btc,just log out and back in again that&#039;s the fastest way of I know to update your account found that out monday after sitting refreshing the page for 3 hours and missing last post&nbsp; ::) but it&#039;s not to hard to have a looksee around the forums,it&#039;s not rocket science,like I told the guy wanting to know how to stash drug&#039;s stop over thinking it just go with what feel&#039;s safe do a little research first and your gonna be cool,i&#039;m no expert and PGP is getting on my nerves so bad i&#039;ve had to back away before my laptop goes through a window but i&#039;ll figure it out,if I can ever find out what it is i&#039;m supposed to download and when I can actually connect to the servers I need but I use privnote for a temp stop gap not the best solution but better than nothing,if anybody has got a pdf file on PGP for dummies with a basic step by step set up i&#039;de be gratefull and ive got a tormail you could send it to (infact let me see if KAT has anything to DL) because i&#039;m reading the site and having to jump arund page&#039;s so much I forget what i&#039;ve read before simply because there&#039;s a lot to take in,if anybody does have a pdf or is willing to sit and type up a step by step guide for a 34 year old that only got a pc 2 year&#039;s ago (but isn&#039;t stupid I can follow stuff to an extent) i&#039;de be gratefull,i&#039;m not to worried about my address to be honest but it&#039;s good to know this stuff even if it&#039;s not for use on SR I know I can find plenty of uses for encryption messaging,especially when the NWO take over the world and we all have to be sneaky MOFO&#039;s...lol<br />No offence nomad&nbsp; :) <br />And no people i&#039;m not arse kissing it&#039;s called respect,something you learn to do and earn to get.<br />Peace <br />&nbsp;8)

				Hey Nomad,<br /><br />Haven&#039;t spoken to you before despite being around for a while, but nice to see level-headedness.&nbsp; I guess this measure has traded some of the work needed to head off the bitcoin scam for work to police threads designed to inflate post counts to 50.&nbsp; So hope the mods don&#039;t find they have more work.<br /><br />I&#039;m in a similar boat to the other poster where I&#039;d like occasionally to post to vendor threads and say, the avengers thread, but am not in a position.&nbsp; Anyway no biggie, I can always PM and I&#039;ve not got any genius to drop so nobody is losing much.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that the forum software doesn&#039;t have better tools to combat the problems you guys have had.<br /><br />Overall I do believe it&#039;ll increase the snr for the forums as a whole which is great - over the last year hysteria, paranoia and people not paying enough attention have, despite the many great folks, given the forums a bit of a strange flavour.&nbsp; Maybe things will get a bit more sane.&nbsp; Either way, interesting experiment.

				Admittedly I am a rare case and I hope this post doesn&#039;t sound like complaining, but this new 50-post limit has really put a potato in my tailpipe of my new vendor account. :( I am in the process of putting up listings, and I was hoping to use the product offers and rumor mills forums to post up grand opening specials and reviews/samples just for forum members, just as all the vendors who have come before me were able to do.

				i ordered express i had to go sign, box was checked but sendors address not provided and it took a day longer than priority. The PO lady said you always have to go to the counter for express unless you sign the notification slip to have it delivered which adds ANOTHER day. supremesmoke refuses to send any way other than express-i haven&#039;t ordered from him- and this smells like honey bacon when they is no way to at least not sign the paper (meaning you know you are expecting a pkg) not sign and have to go to PO to pick up w the paper and why would he do this if its not faster and puts a customer at more risk?

				Fact of the matter is that this 50 post rule sucks but is necessary. I&#039;m not trying to shoot the messenger (nomad), but telling people to quit &quot;overthinking the section&quot; is subversive. You aren&#039;t fooling anyone. Keeping everyone locked up in the Newbie thread harms the quality of posts in and out of the Newbie thread, excluding posts by scammers, spammers, and illegitimate reviewers. And that&#039;s what this is about. Ability to post in the silk road forums is not a civil liberty, I understand that. whatever. But don&#039;t pretend that you&#039;re doing anybody a favor, SR administration is merely doing what they feel they have to in order to protect the integrity of the forum at large. And THAT should be their stance: Sorry SR forum members, but we need to do this to protect the quality of the forums in the long run- once you have 50 posts and waste a ton of time in the Newbie forums it&#039;ll be like none of this ever happened.<br /><br />

				As you guys can see, the 50 post quota doesn&#039;t stop the spammers. They just spam in this section for 50 posts, then head on to the other forums.<br /><br />So basically, this is doing nothing but harming the actual users of this forum. I&#039;m really, really surprised that the people who created the ultimate online anonymous market cannot come up with a half-decent solution to this problem. This 50 post idea is actually EMBARRASSING and I cannot fathom how it&#039;s been in place for longer than a few hours.<br /><br />Like I suggested before, please look up RECAPTCHA and implement it instead of using the useless old version of Captcha which has been cracked by the spammers. If you don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about, I&#039;m referring to the Verification letters you need to type in after every post. I have a forum of my own and the version you guys are using is outdated and completely useless, and it only serves to annoy your users and waste all of our time.<br /><br />Recaptcha does not completely stop spammers, but it will for sure reduce the amount of spam. Big established organizations and businesses use reCaptcha and it works well enough. This 50 post quota is doing nothing but wasting all of our time so please remove it ASAP

				<br />vectorsalimundo <br />&quot;So what actually counts as a post? Does this simple question in an existing thread count? I should also mention I had to message a kind member I could find active in the Technical Support board just to find out about this new rule. There was nothing whatsoever made clear on the main SR forums page or anywhere else about these new rules, which frustrated me for hours until in desperation I messaged the most recently active member I could find to ask WTF was going on. It is really a shame they isolated a lot of devout members like this. Just because I am not super active in the forums and only place orders every few months doesn&#039;t mean I should be lumped in with spammers for fucks sake. Hell if you look back at my post history you can find a specific comment I made pointing out that some people might not necessarily choose to maintain profiles on the forums due to paranoia about law enforcement or simply because they don&#039;t have the time in their lives to frequent the forums. Whoever made this decision is really punishing the semi-lurkers who still have much to contribute to the community. I hope someone in power sees this and passes on the suggestion about grandfathering in older accounts or at least grandfathering in old accounts that have more than 20 posts or something.<br />Quote from: C20H25N3O on Today at 04:14 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Displeased with this situation .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am a member since September 2011&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />We could start a thread for Grandfather Candidates like us and try to get enough visibility the admins see it and start manually grandfathering in people that are obviously not scammers.&quot;

I&#039;m not trying to shoot the messenger (nomad), but telling people to quit &quot;overthinking the section&quot; is subversive. You aren&#039;t fooling anyone. Keeping everyone locked up in the Newbie thread harms the quality of posts in and out of the Newbie thread, excluding posts by scammers, spammers, and illegitimate reviewers. And that&#039;s what this is about. Ability to post in the silk road forums is not a civil liberty, I understand that. whatever. But don&#039;t pretend that you&#039;re doing anybody a favor, SR administration is merely doing what they feel they have to in order to protect the integrity of the forum at large. And THAT should be their stance: Sorry SR forum members, but we need to do this to protect the quality of the forums in the long run- once you have 50 posts and waste a ton of time in the Newbie forums it&#039;ll be like none of this ever happened.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&nbsp; really would WISH members stop making accusations towards me, I&#039;ve had not the first thing to do with any of it and Om not trying to cage anyone up O was simply trying to help but suggesting my time to answer questions for the new members and now instead of a ty I get all the blame.<br />Let me let you guys in on a little something in general i DONT FIND OUT ABOUT CHANGES TIL 24-48 HOURS AFTER IT&#039;S HAPPENED SO i IN NO WAY KNOW WHAT&#039; GOING ON ANY BETTER THAN YOU GUYS,<br />aLSO idk WHO ACTUALLY STARTED DELETING POST IN THIS SECTION UNLESS IT WAS PUT INTO EFFECT RIGHT AFTER i LEFT THIS AFTERNOON FOR A NEW MEBMER ACCUSSERED ME OF CALL ALL BOOBS RETARDS WHICH IN REALITY i DONT USE EIThER WORDS RETARD OR noob WHEN REFERRING THE NEWBIES i CALL THEM NOOBS SI THAT WAS A BLATANT AND TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT ME AMONG,YOU ALL WHEN ive been nithng but nice and very educating to every question i&#039;ve been asked here.<br />I&#039;M GONNA FIND OUT who RGW OISR DEKERIONS GAOOENED AND iM GONNA FIND OUT WHO EIE ITM i HATE WHEN OTHER&nbsp; PPL MAKE ME KIIJ KIJE IVE DONE SOMETHING TO BE SUSPECT OF AND i CANT STAND IT.<br /><br /><br />i&#039;VE BEEN A&nbsp; MODERAToR HERE SINCE R FIRST DAY THE FORUMS WERE OPENED AND i DIDNT JUST SPEND 2 YEARS OF MY life GAINING&nbsp; RESPECT AND TRUST TO HAVE OTHERS DISCREDIT AND ME KTR AWAT DRIBN <br /><br /><br /><br />lOOK i&#039;M SORY YOU CANT UNDERSTAND HALF i JUST POSTED BUT i SPENT 40MINUTES EDITING TO ONLY HAVE THE PAGE AXXDENTAKKT BACJKIAD AND KISE RGE EDIT...i&#039;VE BEN AWAKE FOR DAYS TRYING IMPROVE THIS OVERARE EXPERIENE FR EVERYONE BUT AS YOU CAN TELL FROM MY SOELLING ITS TIMR TO HET SOME SLEEO BEIRE I STROKE OUT...

You have made some post as of late that have been uncommonly reflectful. You posted them, and they will be there when you wake up again. These boards can run themselves for a little bit, I think.<br /><br />No. You did not just spend 2 years to have this happen, so don&#039;t worry about it because the Newbie section is not the only section on Silk, thank God for that.

				personally, I&#039;m glad there&#039;s a newbie section so people can get the hang of it. It helps weed out the impatient. SR and the security involved is no place for the impatient. As a long time mushroom hunter, I can definitely say the good things in life take time

				Rather than simply vent my frustration at the fact that I have wasted a month being able to post anywhere and made only 16 posts, I will try to turn this into a useful post for newbies ... Here are my questions/issues:<br />1. Ratings - 5/5 given to a vendor seems to mean very little - when I read actual comments I see that packaging can be (very) poor, communication slow and deliveries hit and miss and yet vendor gets 5/5. Why? I feel we need to stop doing this as this is disservice to community and neither helps vendors to improve. I feel that comments like &quot;FE on vendors request. Nothing arrived and vendor refuses and re-send or rebate because I am a newbie&quot; should not be next to 5/5 score. Make it at least 3/5.<br />2. FE - in Black Market Reloaded guys have an interesting system where they break an escrow into two parts - shipping and actual product. Some people sassed this out and started breaking their total price into two chunks 50% of which should be released upfront if user is a newbie. Seems to be a lot more reasonable. At least having this option instead of an arbitrary &quot;users who spent less than $1000 should FE or order will be cancelled&quot;. This could allow for a lot more flexible approach<br />3. GPG/PGP - Due to lack of time I still find this whole area just too taxing - too many things to install, read, absorb, etc ... I agree it is important, but here is a small tip I would give to those paranoid buyers who are worried about putting their address into the order form - use www.privnote.com and generate a link that can be used only once and its contents are being deleted as it is displayed first time. This way even if your order remains on the system and imaginary perpetrator gets to this record all they will ever be able to see is a dead link<br />and 4 and my biggest frustration so far - where is more mescaline? :) I would really welcome ideas or suggestions on how I can get access to extracted mescaline<br /><br />Sorry for the long rant - may be I should have broken it up into 34 pieces and be off :)

				I don&#039;t really mind the newbie section too much, It is annoying but it serves its purpose. One thing that would be cool would be to add sub forums for newbies, having it all crammed into this board makes it very difficult for stuff not to get buried in spam. Or really just buried in general, imagine the entire main forum all on one board, it would be a bitch to find what you&#039;re looking for or to get a question answered. Just an idea.

				Hi everyone. As my status say I&#039;m a newbie, I&#039;ve heard about SR months ago but decided to join in these days. The fact is, I point to be a vendor and to respect the place that probably will make me have a more anonymous, trustworthy job. That&#039;s my question: after reached the 50 posts am i allowed to post in vendor&#039;s section? In particular, what&#039;s the procedure?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was reading a few people&#039;s recent comments and wanted to make some of my own:<br /><br />1) I agree with the general idea of the post minimum to deter scammers and such. I haven&#039;t heard of any official word about only having a month to reach that number or being stuck here. If that is the case, however, I agree with some of the other users that that seems silly. Many of us have day jobs, lives, etc. that greatly limit how often we can access SR. On top of that, like someone said before me, in a forum as clusterfucked as the newbie forum, particular threads get overshadowed quite quickly. Especially like right now (at the time of this post) when there is 40+ threads of spam going on.<br /><br />Zombai, do you know anything about this month long time limit to hit 50 posts?<br /><br />2) I agree with PotatoConnoisseur: Having the newbie forum in one giant block does seem like poor organization. I suppose there could be an argument for the status quo being more effective in deterring spam, but I can&#039;t imagine why.<br /><br />3) I think Incogmagnito (cool name btw) raises some good points as well. The 5 of 5 ratings do seem far too easy to get. I&#039;ve seen several transactions with people saying the shipment never got there (even domestically) next to a 5 of 5 rating. Something as important as that shouldn&#039;t be so superfluous. I also think the option of splitting up finalization is more fair than either doing it early or when the product arrives.<br />On the other hand, I don&#039;t think PGP is as hard as it looks. With only the newbie forum and the Compendium to help me, I was able to figure it out with relative ease. Privnote, while useful in the short term, I think gets to be too much of a hassle once you start ordering things more regularly. What I did was sit down with my computer for about 15-30 minutes (I don&#039;t have much time atm) and piece through it little by little. Walking away from computer trouble for a little while keeps you from getting frustrated and thus helps you fix the issue more easily.<br /><br />Sorry if the post was too long, just trying to be a good supporting member while also aiming for my 50 post mark lol.

				Are members still locked of this forum once they hit 50?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been said before but I&#039;ll say it anyway (mostly to boost my post count), what about people who are genuinely valuable and useful to the community but are new here. Take that ex-prosecutor, HJSlinger? Something like that, his thread would be nothing if he could only post in here. The throwaway accounts giving insider information would no doubt get lost. Assuming 50+ people still can&#039;t post in here.<br /><br />Seen there is a thread giving legal advice...Why the need for two? Once people reach 50 I doubt they&#039;d come back to check here for information...You&#039;d need to set up a new account just to ask a question.<br /><br />Had a little look to see if this is still the case, looks like it is? ...Had another look...it has been sorted I guess. Problem solved. <br /><br />(I&#039;ve written this now...I&#039;m not gonnna not post it).

I do not think anyone can answer this for you with certainty (correct me if I am wrong), if you have an awesome street guy that you know of very, very well then it could be just as risky as SR or less risky. It depends on so many factors, if the vendor on SR is using really good stealth packaging and what not then it does not really make much difference what it is you are buying. A professional, long time vendor with good feedback and many transactions with a year membership will probably deliver more reliably than a street guy. Read up on packaging stealth in the forums, I stumbled upon a very useful thread once explaining the importance of uniformly distributing the contents inside the package making it look less like powder or pills or whatever. But there are also so many other things these professional vendors are doing right. <br /><br /><br />I hope I have not confused you further, but it depends on so many factors. The best advice I can give you is to not take anyone&#039;s advice on a whim, do a lot of reading on the forums and in the SR wiki, try to find stuff that applies to your country. Domestic shipments are usually very, very safe. I would say that in my country, which has very strict customs, (only one order from Netherlands caught by customs because Netherlands is flagged and vendor used poor packaging methods), any domestic purchase would more than likely come the next day and also be as safe as it can be. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SR WIKI<br /><br />I choose to do ALL of my drug purchases here on SR since I stumbled upon it a few months ago. I have been scammed once of about 350 USD. IN MY EXPERIENCE:&nbsp; I still believe SR to be worth it and that it is safer for me than in the streets of my country considering the rate of success I have had with good vendors so far. What I am trying to say is...<br /><br />Make up your own damn mind! To quote the great Oracle, it is still a risk there is no denying that. If you choose to use SR, do research as much as you can to minimise the risk (read your local drug laws, read up on stealth packaging in SR, find out which vendor is reliable and pro etc). <br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Entity<br /><br />

				Nomad, <br />This Newbie forum is, and always will be, useless.&nbsp; This whole policy was poorly thought out from the beginning.&nbsp; I&#039;m an established vendor doing business for 6 months.&nbsp; I have a legitimate review thread in the proper location.&nbsp; Not only do I have to spam 50 messages to be able to access my own damn review thread, but worse than that, new customers won&#039;t be able to post their feedback on my product.&nbsp; Now my thread will be fragmented, with separate comments in the newbie section. <br />Likewise, I was legitimately contributing to other threads with a different username that I will now have to start a whole new discussion in the newbie forum, where the &quot;pros&quot; aren&#039;t even going to be looking at.<br />If the goal was to reduce spamming, then this policy fails big time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent two hours today spamming the damn forums to gain access again, and I&#039;m likely going to have to do it with my other account too.&nbsp; <br />Brilliant plan!

				anyone other thinks that SR staff takes always sellers side if seller brings in enough money(i mean like seller rank top 1%)&nbsp; when escrow goes to staffs judgement? i just got raped in the ass by supertrips and SR staff. supertrips did not show any proof that he even sent any pills for me, ofc we dealt through escrow and I waited ~50 days to get this case closed. Supertrips just commented that &quot;your address is flagged, refund 0%&quot; and staff accepted that. In supertrips T&amp;C says, 100% refund or resend if package wont show. I never got anything, waited through xmas holidays extensions with resolution center. when i didn&#039;t want to get resend (because it has turned it is very very hard to get packets through&nbsp; scandinavian customs nowadays) resolution center just released my money to ST and said its my fault my address is flagged. AND I AM PRETTY SURE MY ADDRESS IS NOT &quot;flagged&quot; BECAUSE JUST YESTERDAY GOT NICE PIECE OF HASH WITH INTERNATIONAL MAIL. its just, I did not want to get resend because it was worth big money( ok only ~450 usd, big amount of cash for me but maybe not for everyone). <br />I sent message for ST if he still wants to give me some refund, lets see what he answers before I go to leave feedback. ofc 1/5 if nothing changes, but if ST or SR Staff comes to some other resolution than 0% refund then i will give 5/5. <br />This just makes me feel like ST is doing huge ending-scam ATM because he just changed his T&amp;C to FE every order under 1000 usd.

				this was something like fifth or sixth deal I made with ST and always before everything has went perfect, always packets to scandinavia in 4 days and really dont want to believe he just turned scammer. <br />was I just too blue-eyed faith with SR Staff and ST? I really wanted to believe in SR Staff but this is first case what went to their judgement, and now i feel i got 10 inch dildo in my ass.<br /><br />Remember always when doing drug-business that nothing is 100% sure and you&#039;re ALWAYS DOING BUSINESS WITH CRIMINALS, in every country in the world dealing drugs is illegal. so use your brains and NEVER FE! I have never finalized early and it was very very hard and it took a while to get those couple first deals done and built some &quot;reputation&quot; but after that, every good vendor accepts escrow. and even if your money is in escrow, its not 100% sure, there is always change your money is gone.

				Hi everybody<br /><br />there is something I can&#039;t understand with this new rules<br />I ama legit SR Vendor, I am here as a seller for more than 6 monthes<br />I have always be between 95% and 100% in my selling stats<br />etc....etc....<br /><br />But what a surprise I can&#039;t even post in my own official thread<br />I mean I have created a Thread for my customers 6 monthes ago<br />This thread is linked on my main vendor page so my customers can post their review, delivery issues....<br /><br /><br />BUT NOW I CAN&#039;T ACCESS TO MY OWN FORUM PAGE<br /><br />So I can&#039;t reply <br />I can&#039;t post new about my listings and special offer<br /><br />What&#039;s wrong with you guys<br />I understand your 50 posts rules<br />But really....I have other things to do with my real life job and my Silk Road order than spend my time to reach this 50posts<br /><br />The stupid thing in this situation is that like other newbies I will reply and post bullshit thing just to increase my post count<br /><br />I can understand the rule for newbie but for&nbsp; the legit and old seller it&#039;s a non sense<br />And I know that other seller are in this situation, just because they don&#039;t spend all their time in the forum and don&#039;t have 50 posts<br /><br />If a mod can aswer me it would be great<br /><br />Thx<br />Merlin<br /><br />

				I was introduced to SR about three weeks ago and have been trying to do as much research as possible before placing my first order. However there is one question I have not been able to find the answer to. My question is about the vendors adjusting the price of their product based on the changing value of bitcoins.(assuming that they do) Because, what was once a reasonable price two months ago is now an exorbitant amount. I&#039;m sure there is a simple answer to this, but i did not want to ask any vendors a potentially (newb) question. If anyone knows the answer to this please let me know asap. I am anxious to get started! Thanks.

From what I was told it depends on the vendor; some vendors&#039; prices reflect the change of the BTC value, while others choose that their BTC prices stay the same, regardless of the current value of BTC. If you see a vendor whose prices do not change based on the changing value of BTC, you can always PM them to work something out regarding the price. Or if you don&#039;t like their prices you can go to another vendor. Hope this helped.

				Hey all.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was going to post a new thread to ask this very specific question, but then noticed this thread and decided to ask here.<br /><br />Anyway, I just made my first order and am wondering if I should worry about a top vendor that does not seem to be up on his game when it comes to security.&nbsp; <br /><br />First of all, this is a top 15%** vendor with more than 200** transactions, &gt;98%** satisfaction rate, and an active review thread here on the forums.&nbsp; The trouble started when I sent him my address which I encrypted at 2048 bits using gpg4win.&nbsp; He sent me a message ~27 hours later saying he had a problem with the message and asked if I could re-encrypt it or send it with privnote.&nbsp; Now, I am 99.9% sure I encrypted it right, but just to make sure I:<br />&nbsp;1) Made a public/private key with my anonymous information<br />&nbsp;2) Saved his 1024 bit public key in a .txt file using notepad and imported it into gpg4win<br />&nbsp;3) Opened up the clipboard and wrote a brief message including my address and MY public key<br />&nbsp;4) Encrypted the message using HIS public key<br />&nbsp;5) Pasted the encrypted message in the order form and checked out<br />Now, I looked into privnote and I really do not feel comfortable using it because there are too many unknowns.&nbsp; For example, somebody else might have access to his tormail account or privnote might itself be corrupt.<br /><br />Now, here is where I started to get suspect about his security practices.&nbsp; I noticed that on his seller profile, several links are given as .onion.to addresses.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that he may be using onion.to to conduct business and read my private messages, and I am unsure about the safety of it. If it is NOT safe, as I suspect, then he is putting me in major risk of exposure.<br /><br />So, what does anyone think, am I safe?&nbsp; I am pretty sure that even if this goes through I won&#039;t order form this vendor again.&nbsp; I made the order on Feb 3 at 9:30pm UTC and he didn&#039;t message me for over 24 hours, and the reply I sent him 2 hours after he sent his message hasn&#039;t even been read.&nbsp; This just seems very rude of him.<br /><br />**I adjusted with worse figures because I do not want to give away who this vendor is.&nbsp; If I have nothing to worry about, then I do not want him to get bad exposure.

I feel like if he didnt have tracking, well i dont know whats the best - refund at half price or resolve? Plz help me out , I never had this sitch- the other no show (ironically the same country of origin) guy refunded 100% and i gave him a btc for his trouble.

This is a new born section so of course it&#039;s gonna need a little time to become organized and setup to be just as useful as the other sections of the forum...treating it like a punishment for being new is not the way to look at it. Why not create threads yopu can leave behind to grow as a legacy, Like FAQ&#039;s on certain subjects that new members and browse as a location to answers everyone have when first getting into the forum community.<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m just telling you guys that this current spam boosting post crap is gonna be a limited thing soon it&#039;s gonna be phased out because this is also to slow the increase of throw away shrill accounts as well in the forum that creates all kinds of deception in feedback and review threads in the rumor mill. It&#039;s only currently be allowed because it was put into place without anyone given in warning.<br />This section isnt just for the btc spammers but for slowing down several issues that plague the community.<br /><br />I want everyone to understand that the answers you get here are gonna be from the most knowledgeable in the community. As long as ppl say this is a useless section than that&#039;s how many will think but in reality it&#039;s far from useless and can be very much a great section for easing into the way things work around here and the do&#039;s and don&#039;t for new members. I believe posts in this section are just as important as posts in any other section. We reap what we sow. <br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well Stated, sir!&nbsp; I agree. Yet honest questions get about 9 views and 2 replies, and last check... another spam thread &quot;PLACE SPAM HERE TO GET 50&quot; had 26,651 Replies vs. 31,000 plus views.&nbsp; That is what I wanted answered.&nbsp; Why cant these threads get blocked or locked?

				Thanks for hints.&nbsp; I was able to find a CLI utility called jhead I can install in tails.<br /><br />To remove all EXIF info from a single image just open a terminal window and type:<br /><br />jhead -purejpg /path/to/image.jpg<br /><br />You can also use wild cards so you can use:<br /><br />jhead -purejpg /path/to/*.jpg<br /><br />or<br /><br />jhead -purejpg /path/to/*.JPG

				Fine thread. I feel that overspamming just to reach 50 posts is not appealing. <br /><br />On the subject of questions: I was actually just wondering about the karma indicator. For what it&#039;s worth - if it&#039;s no inconvenience - I&#039;d like to read some official text on why the karma system is here.&nbsp; I can make sense of the system in my head, however I would like to hear a second opinion.&nbsp; Specifically, I have capriciously wondered why the system allows such a publicly manipulated indicator to be seen to all viewers of the forum.&nbsp; How can it be strong if it can be carelessly moved?&nbsp; A user could, for example, arbitrarily - or + another users credentials, thus creating a false image.&nbsp; Is there a fail-safe for this system, or is it just inherently that weak? <br /><br />I&#039;m merely curious.&nbsp; I did not design the system, therefore, I may not see the big picture as the dev team did/does, but I am interested to hear the pro&#039;s reasoning.<br /><br />Also &gt; I do wish to take the opportunity, as a newbie, to type some thanks for this community.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been excited about this flock of folk and I hope that the system at large keeps up the good work!&nbsp; Ray John, everyone, Ray John!&nbsp; 8)
