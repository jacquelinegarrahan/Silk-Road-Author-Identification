				I was wondering what people&#039;s preferred method of purchasing BTC were?<br /><br />I recently made my first purchase through localbitcoins. It was fast, simple, and more importantly anonymous. Never had to give my name anywhere along the line.<br /><br />When I researched using bitinstant it said you had to give your name during the stage when you&#039;re at CVS/Walgreens.<br /><br />What about Coinbase? Anything good there?<br /><br />Also, when you transfer your funds to SR wallet is it good to change wallet address after you receive coins? Is this something I should do after the completion of any transaction?<br /><br />I am in the beginning process of an order, still has not been marked as in transit. Should I now, or after switch wallet address? Or wait for this order to be done?<br /><br />I have read this is important in minimizing traceability on the blockchain.

				That&#039;s what I am thinking. 5-10 more per BTC, but so simple. Have you ever did this with larger deposits, say 800?

				Nope, never anything that big, but if the seller has good reviews, you should be totally fine.

				Just to be clear I meant 800 USD, but that&#039;s cool if you haven&#039;t. <br /><br />That seems to be the reigning overtone, RESEARCH. If the guy on local bitcoins is legit, which the one I&#039;ve tried is 100+/100% and did good today, then getting BTC is safe.<br /><br />Then it comes to researching vendor. Plus the beauty of SR and using a escrow system, as long as you are playing legit, getting f&#039;ed can only happen from the post office it seems. <br /><br />I am going to start another thread on that right now.

				Yeah, I just usually buy a couple BTC at a time, so I&#039;ve never spent $800. Sorry! But yeah, as long as somebody has good reviews (or for a vendor, if people on here say good stuff), it&#039;s probably safe.

				Thank you for your replies, and don&#039;t be sorry. Where I live prices are ridiculous for midgrade weed. And I simply want to provide a safe commodity to people at a better profit for myself and a better price for them. It&#039;s not unusual here for people to buy zips for 350. If I can sell mid grade at 250, the responsible people I deal with are going to be stoked.

				I&#039;ve had good success with localbitcoins.com - one transaction in person went so flawlessly - we had a 1/2 hour conversation about tech - we swapped coin on smartphones - when I saw the confirmation I handed him an envelope, which he walked away with without counting. There is something to be said for face-to-face interactions in building trust. He was an awesome guy, into BTC for a while, had two listings open one local and one in the EU where he was going on vacation.<br /><br />2nd trade on localbitcoins I went with escrow and bank deposit. I anonymously deposited cash into their bank account and received coins the next morning (we traded over a saturday night otherwise he said it would have been faster)<br /><br />You can get cheaper bitcoins on coinbase.com, but you need to link your bank account and when you first create your account you will have to wait up to a week for your coins. But you&#039;re paying a fair amount less, and you can always make them untraceable by splitting them &amp; moving through a few anonymous wallets. Bitcoins are a commodity and it&#039;s not illegal to trade in them.

				Yeah I think I am going to stay with them. The guy I went through was awesome in how fast he does it. Responds almost instantly to anything you send him.
