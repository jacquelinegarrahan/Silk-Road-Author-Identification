				Hello Silk Road and welcome to my third lucid dream/astral projection thread. This thread will have you soaring through the sky in your dreams hopefully in no time at all. Now to keep this thread alive I&#039;d be greatful if you would take the time to post your thoughts, results, or ideas. <br /><br />WILDs<br /><br />WILD is an acronym quite well known throughout the lucid dreaming community. It stands for wake-initiated lucid dream. To successfully perform this will take a night or two. Listen to me when I state that sleep paralysis IS NOT SCARY. You&#039;ve most likely heard how when you open your eyes there are demons and scary shit everywhere this is true and false, it depends on the person. The trick is is to keep calm and have your eyes closed at all times. Relaxation.<br /><br />The Actual Tutorial<br /><br />You are in your bed and ready to try sleep paralysis before you start calming down you need to have good posture when sleeping. I preferably lie as straight as a board with my hands on my hips. This will help when going into SP.<br />The easiest thing you&#039;ll find about this tutorial is that it is JUST breathing. In through the nose out through the mouth. Simple. <br /><br />Lying down on your bed while doing the breathing I want you to say the alphabet in your head for every breath in and out. <br />A<br />B<br />C<br />D<br />E<br />F<br />When you hit around the letter F you will feel super relaxed, a funny feeling at first. <br />G<br />H<br />I<br />J<br />K<br />L<br />M<br />N<br />O<br />Around here you&#039;ll feel next to nothing in your legs and hands like you are well... paralyzed. <br />P<br />Q<br />R<br />S<br />By this time your fully unable to control your body and you will not be able to move for a thing, stay calm and carry on :).<br />T<br />U<br />V<br />W<br />X<br />Y<br />Z<br />By this time you should start to feel surges of electricity through your body it feels great but it&#039;ll startle you. It&#039;s fine. By this time you&#039;ll also start to enter your very first lucid dream. <br /><br />You can&#039;t move by Z but your ready to start playing with your mind and having a wonderful time in your own head. Just drift asleep ;). <br /><br />Look out for the next lucidity guide on how to lucid dream without sleep paralysis and how to master the art &lt;3.<br />

				This sounds like it&#039;ll be fun haha I&#039;ve also been interested in this but thought it was some real hard thing to do and never really looked into it. I&#039;m going to give it a try and hopefully I&#039;ll remember to continue doing it for a while! Have you ever nodded off or fallen asleep while trying to do this? Also, I tend to smoke bud at night, do you think that would effect it in any sort of way? maybe make it a bit easier to drift into the lucid dream state perhaps if you stay focused on it? I&#039;m excited to give it a try, Thanks!

				Try adding in some ZMA and or Alpha brain. Both compounds are great for lucid dreaming. It&#039;s amazing how much better you feel after a night of deep REM sleep compared to a night of light sleep.
