				you mean you want to BUY a USB with all the security stuff here on SR?&nbsp; <br /><br />why? <br />everything that is on them is available for free, you just have to do a bit of research how it works.<br />(take a look at the security sub here)<br />and (even more important) you have no clue if the vender left you a little &quot;surprise&quot; on the stick for free.<br /><br />just my 2 satoshis

				tails is a devian OS and is all you&#039;ll need, plus 1 or 2 8gb usb flash drives<br /><br />here - read thru this thread, it&#039;s not terribly long http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0<br /><br />i&#039;m a fred flintstone of this stuff, and i still managed - granted it took me three 4-5 hour sessions but i got there<br /><br />is it worth it? - yeah, because now all traces of your SR visits, TOR mail visits (i open my tormail online, etc are now contained on an ecrypted usb drive that you take out when thru and it wipes virtually all the bread crumbs your computer would normally store<br /><br />once Tails is installed on your usb drive, you insert it in one of the usb sockets or ports on your computer, turn computer off and reboot, this time booting up using the USB flash drive<br /><br />go thru the thread, order the flash drives from wherever (newegg.com is a good source) and try it - if i can help, PM me, it&#039;ll be something of the blind leading the blind but i&#039;ll also be familiar the blocks you&#039;re not seeing cause i just went thru them<br /><br />hope that helps

				ok well if i can get a blank one it has to be Linux compatible because TAILS is correct? also if i get a 3.0 USB stick and use my friend computer but he only has a 2.0 or lets say lower, it will still run just slower right? oh and why are you saying 2? <br />any why does the tutorial say a dvd to a usb im comfused as hell now!
