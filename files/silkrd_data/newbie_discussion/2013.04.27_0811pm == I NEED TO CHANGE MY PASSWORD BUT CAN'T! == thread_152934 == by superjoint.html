				Yesterday after all the trouble i began to think that the attackers were trying to get out pass words and personal info. I had already had tons of trouble to get into the sight using regular and only password and using name. Just to be safe i decided to come up here and change everything, as its safer than being sorry.&nbsp; I nmde a purchase and it accepted my pass number pin, but i have still had big time troubles just entering the site. after trying trying ton change my info, it locked me out, saying that i tried more than&nbsp; times. Sometimes it takes longer than that just to access the sight. the big problem is, I am gonna own my vendor his money soon and i cannot be late or mess him over, hes too legit. I also don&#039;t think this was my fault. it obviously took my money when i ordered it (after a few times.) Is there anyone out here withn authority this site who could help me out? there&#039;s gotta b a way. i could answer my home address ....you could give me anything to help me get in. hours is a long time. Please, if you know of a way to make this process go quicker, please write me. i will give you my user name on SR in private, i just dont want to mingle the two. BLOODBATH? ANYONE? GOT ANY GOOD SUGGEST|IONS OR AM I JUST&nbsp; SCREWED. THANKS YOU ALL.<br />

				Calm down a bit. You won&#039;t be able to think clearly otherwise.<br /><br />Just take your time and make sure you type your passwords correctly.<br />The site has been working great for me lately. Approximately 10 second response time. (lol... Tor)&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Good luck man.

				There&#039;s no way to speed up the process - the only thing you can do is to create a new account and message SR Support from that new account.&nbsp; Ask them to reset your password on your original account.&nbsp; They will probably ask for some information to verify the account belongs to you.

				THanks for the info...here&#039;s what has me the most worried about starting a new account....Warning:<br /><br />DO NOT forget or lose your PIN and passphrase!!! Your PIN is required to make purchases, withdraw funds, and make important changes to your account. If you forget your PIN or passphrase, or give it to the wrong people on a phishing site, for example, there will be NO WAY to recover your account. All money deposited to your account and reputation associated with it will be lost!!!<br /><br />Does this mean I will lose my money, my that&#039;s orders that;s comimg in? sorry i sound a bit stressed and confused but this has me&nbsp; freaking out. thank you for your help.

				I&#039;m just saying start a new account so you can get in touch with SR Support.&nbsp; They can help reset the password to your original account, so you can go back to using that account ...

The only way that you lose money is if you had funds left in that account or if one of your orders either doesn&#039;t arrive or is bogus. Otherwise you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />Like Scout has said, it&#039;s best to just create a new account if you forget your password. In fact, that used to be the only way when I started out here. I didn&#039;t know they were resetting passwords now until I read Scout&#039;s post.<br /><br />If you forget your pin, then you can&#039;t make any purchases or transfer any coins to any other member. That&#039;s it though.<br /><br />That happened to me when they first implemented the PINs (they didn&#039;t always have&nbsp; them). In that case, you have to use the maximum number of attempts to guess and let it lock your pin. Then you have to email support 7-10 days later and ask them to reset it for you (which they do promptly -- there&#039;s info on this on the SR site -- this is to the best of my memory as to what happened to me over a year ago).<br /><br />Losing your PIN is more of a PIA than anything. I THINK (not 100% sure) that if you lose your password and start a new account, they can move your buyer&#039;s stats to the new account if you can provide enough information on the old account to support.<br /><br />All of this is in the wiki I believe.
