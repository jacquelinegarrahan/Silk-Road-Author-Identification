				I&#039;ve read TOR isn&#039;t as safe as first thought and that the NSA probably could get to you if they really wanted to.<br /><br />In one thread someone said they had a big antenna and can use the open wifi signal down the block but that is not feasible for me.<br /><br />Should I worry about that if all I am doing is going to be making small purchases like $100 - $200 USD<br /><br />Or is it worth the drive to the local place offering free wifi.<br /><br />What do YOU do?

You know, more hops must be better, right?. That&#039;s just incorrect -- if anything VPNs make the situation worse since they basically introduce either a permanent entry guard (if the VPN is set up before Tor) or a permanent exit node (if the VPN is accessed through Tor).<br /><br />Similarly, we don&#039;t want to support VPNs as a replacement for Tor since that provides terrible anonymity and hence isn&#039;t compatible with Tails&#039; goal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not to mention you&#039;d have to trust that VPN not to cave to gov.<br /><br /><br />Wifi on a public lan... I&#039;m not too hip on that.&nbsp; It&#039;s much easier to fuck with a computer on your same lan than it is elsewhere.&nbsp; Not sure how this plays out with tor traffic though.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t fell comfortable with it.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve set up something else... followed a few of the long tutorials in the security forum. vbox os stuff.<br /><br />But yeah, I&#039;d trust that.&nbsp; Many here use tails.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to look for a thread where a resident computer/security expert here lists the safety of setups.

				Dude with free wifi comes 0 encryption think about it not safe at all<br /><br />There are lots of vpn&#039;s that openly admit to keeping records etc and lots that say they will close the servers and move before handing out info to LE I use one called private internet access as all you need is a email (easy to get with fake name etc) and they accept btc as payment but as I stoped being lazy I just got tails running as is much safer i believe

Then use the VPN over the open wifi connection. It make no use to sign up with a VPN like private internet access with a fake name from your home IP address which could be traced back to you.<br /><br />I am still not sure how tails hides your home IP address any better than just TOR because i thought TAILS uses TOR

				The best set up in my limited technical know how would be as follows<br /><br />Tails + 2x VPN&#039;s (paid in bitcoin) + Onion Pi<br /><br />That would be pretty secure I think...a bit much...but in my mind is sounds&nbsp; bullet proof.

				Basically, Tails isn&#039;t widows based.<br /><br />The FBI took over servers/sites... and when you visited them, it secretly injected malicious code which somehow gave up the IP of windows users.&nbsp; Well users that didn&#039;t have up to date tbb and javascript disabled. <br /><br />People using linux or tails were not infected.<br /><br />I guess windows is just real leaky compared to linux/tails

				Personally I think both TAILS and Liberte Linux on bootable USBs are both very secure options for buyers and good starting points to learn about Linux, PGP and Security in general.<br /><br />As far as VPN&#039;s go, I recommend Private Internet Access, they keep no logs and only require an email address to sign up, plus you can pay with BTC for anonymity. You could always run Tor, your PGP program and a wallet from an encrypted USB stick and connect to Tor via the VPN.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
