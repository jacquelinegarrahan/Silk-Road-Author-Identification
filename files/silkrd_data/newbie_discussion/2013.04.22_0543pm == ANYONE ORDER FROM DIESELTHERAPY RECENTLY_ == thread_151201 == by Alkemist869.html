				I&#039;m looking for other feedback about Dieseltherapy that has not already been posted. I placed an order last tue and wednesday he said he would ship on thurs. On friday he said he would send me a tracking # but I haven&#039;t heard from him since and i&#039;ve been PM&#039;ing him everyday. Anybody else waiting on a shipment from him? I hope he didn&#039;t get busted or anything. On his vendor page some of his reviews say they received shipments in 3 days but I just wanted to know if there was anyone else out there that are waiting for anything from him or if anybody has heard from him since Friday? Thanks

				Hey, sorry about not being able to respond to you on Silk Road but it has been hell for me logging onto the site. Take right now for instance, the home page is the only page that will even partially load for me and that is taking twenty complete minutes to do. I left a message in the review thread that some of the packages that were shipped fell victim to the flood here in the midwest last week. I have been checking the tracking and for all of the ones that have not yet registered, they have been repackaged and will be shipped as soon as I can download today&#039;s orders. <br /><br />I apologize for the inconvenience. The packages that you all have on the way will be compensated though.

				I messaged him a couple times between my order on last Thursday. He did finally message me back on Monday night sometime when i was asleep just saying that his SR has been acting funny lately. I was getting worried for a minute because i got a bday coming up and if my coins were to be returned i wouldn&#039;t have time to order myself my bday gift lol. But he marked my order Monday as in transit so i will get it in time and will post a review as promised on his review thread. I normally don&#039;t order from anyone other then DeluxeDelivery if i am looking for stamps or hatter if im looking for cold shoot. But i am gonna give this vendor a chance because DD is already sent me something. I had just enough for a sampler of each from DT. so look for my review on his page and so far so good DT. welcome to SR.

				He did get back to me Mon and said he reshipped me a package on monday to make up for the one that was suppose to be sent thursday. He did post on saturday that some of the express orders he sent got flooded out but mine wasn&#039;t express and on friday he said he would send me a tracking # but never did. When i questioned him about the shipment and the tracking # later he got all cheeky about giving me the number for the order he was suppose to send on thurs which makes me think that he never sent it then, i hope i&#039;m wrong and the proof will be if i get two packages!! he did say that he was going to put extra in the reships and i originally requested a sample of blow so we&#039;ll see. i really want to give this vendor a chance but as my first order i&#039;m not very satisfied at the moment. i&#039;ll give him the benefit of the doubt on the first shipment getting lost in the flood but if the reship sent monday doesn&#039;t hit me by thursday then i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll be able to use him as a regular supplier because i&#039;ll need someone closer that can get me my shit in 2 days!<br /><br />i&#039;ll keep you all posted and likewise do the same. let me know how long your packages took to arrive. I live in the delaware valley and i gather he is from midwest where the floods were so we&#039;ll see what the transit time is...

				DieselTherapy came through for me!<br />Ordered Mon, got here today (express shipping).<br />I ordered some stamps, but got lil baggies instead.<br />Stealth could definitely be better though. A lot better.<br />Overall pretty smooth transaction, was worrying for nothing.

				This is really starting to push the limits of my patience. It&#039;s been &#039;in transit&#039; for 7 days. I&#039;ve put off other orders because of this and kept faith that mine was in the bunch that were waterlogged. Today there has still been no arrival. I&#039;m not busting balls or trying to taint a new vendors name cause I know it can be hard but come on. Under my assumption that my package was in the water delayed group I was hoping it would be expressed and it hasn&#039;t yet. Also, some feedback would have been nice. I know SR is having problems but seriously. <br /><br />Edit: Obviously I was not in a decent mood at the time I wrote this. My bad. Hope to hear something soon.

				I hope that doesn&#039;t mean that my order was not sent until tuesday because you told me that it was reshipped monday. I placed my order Tue the 16th and was &#039;supposedly&#039; sent thurs but was &#039;flooded&#039; or something. I was told that my order was reshipped on Mon but according to your last post it was Tues since mine was regular mail not express. So basically one week from order to ship. I get that you want to take care of the express people but their shipments are guaranteed for two day delivery whereas priority and regular mail take a little longer. It would&#039;ve made sense to send the slow shit out first since those customers have already been waiting too long also. For future reference as a vendor you should prioritize your shipments based on when the order was placed. I know you want to please the people who pay a little more but like I said before to you, the H game is about repeat customers. You may have lost me because my small order seemed minor and put me on the backburner meanwhile I got a fat stack here and three friends that would have spent several K a month but they have their doubts as to your reliability. The reship may redeem you if its here tomorrow, if not, well lets keep positive...<br />Also for future reference you should mail your shit from the post office itself. There is usually a drop slot inside if you don&#039;t want to deal with the postpeople. If you are sending anything big, write on the outside &quot;Your Amazon.com order is here!&quot; I sell on Amazon and have to write that on my packages. Its actually good to get to know your postpeople, tell them you sell on Amazon if they notice you coming in frequently. I&#039;m in the post office 3 times a week sending books (books are a good way to send contraband, cut out a slot and no metal packaging in case of Xray). Media Mail is cheap but slow. If you are sending in say a three state radius media mail is just a couple days. They will give you an estimated delivery date and if its too long then upgrade to express or priority. You should definitely hit the vendor forums and work on your shipping methods and times. I&#039;ll PM you tomorrow morning after my mail comes, hopefully with good news!

Please do not order from me ever again. I am almost of the mind set that you are a competitor attempting to stir things up. What do you not understand about there being a flood that covered multiple areas throughout the Midwest. It was spoken about on umm.... every national news report in the country for multiple days. What do you not understand that people who pay for extra services such as express mail take precedence over someone who chooses not to pay for these additional options. This is not rocket science. Your order is in the mail. I actually lost money here by having to replace everything that was lost in the flood. I am not complaining. Please...<br /><br />Thank you.

				Ok yeah maybe media mail isn&#039;t good. All mail is subject to inspection though. I just use media mail all the time. Sorry that i&#039;m raving but my patience has run out. The reason i said about taking the packages into the post office is because apparently the mailbox is not free from flooding. Also it speeds things up by putting them right in. I&#039;m probably biased about postal employees because 2 or my uncles and my father-in-law are all postmen. I suggested getting to know them if he was going to be mailing stuff alot to pretend he was selling on amazon, but you&#039;re right its probably best for the postpeople to never see you. I thought to get the tracking you had to deal with a person because they postmark your slip/tracking receipt but now most mailing services can be completed online. Its just been 9 days since i ordered and haven&#039;t got anything when I was expecting 3 or 4 days. This is my first order and i got people waiting to see how this goes before they jump in. I lost half my money when the coins dropped and now the delivery is taking forever. They obviously don&#039;t have any faith in the system. Also keep in mind that we are dope fiends and need shit right away. But I&#039;ll try to keep my opinions to myself. LE?? thats funny, i get that all the time on the street but my track marks prove otherwise.<br />DT you can understand why i feel the way i do based on all our PM&#039;s. I&#039;m not trying to make you look bad but i&#039;m honestly not happy with the time this is taking and the replys you gave me. I know I asked way too many questions but there were simple things you could&#039;ve done to shut me (ie tracking #, answer all my ?&#039;s). When I receive one or two deliveries I&#039;ll owe you a huge apology...

As I stated earlier, your business is the type of business that I try to avoid. I do not have the time to hold your hand after a thorough explanation has been given. Initially you came across in the pms as if you had ordered express. Once I found out that you did not, I explained that the tracking would be given if your package was taking too long BUT I was reshipping a package to you because of the fact that a shitload of packages were apparently destroyed in the floods. If you are going to complain because of matters beyond anyone&#039;s control, I do not want your business. Please shop elsewhere. Thank you and have a nice day.

				Thanks for clearing this up on SR Alkemist but I believe that you also need to clear it up here also because the last anyone has heard from you is that you are a discontented client of mine who hasn&#039;t received anything. Please clear this up here.<br /><br />&quot;Heroin Stamp Bags &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alkemist869 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first order on SR and not what I expected. Placed order on Tues at 2pm, Wed evening was told it would be shipped out Thurs morn. Floods came and package was lost so Mon was told it was reshipped but it was actually Wed by the postmark and sellers posts on the forum. Received Sat for a total of 11 days! But in reality 3 days to reach me on the east coast. Quantity was equivalent to 3 stamp bags here so decent weight, quality was about a 7 in a city that normally has 8/9 quality dope. Cooked up clean with little residue, dark amber color but was much more bitter than what is here (more quinine). Did a full bag shot and got a rush equivalent to 1.5 bags of our 8 quality dope. Mild initial rush but stayed coming for about 15 mins, so it was a nice level, long onset. Did another bag about 40 mins later with the same effect. Gave me the energy I was looking for and was able to go out on the town and drink a few beers without nodding or getting sick. 18 hrs later the sniffles started. Our city has some of the best powder dope in the country according to our local needle exchange so this dope was slightly above average here but would be considered fire out in the boonies. Was a fair value for the money and someone with a lower tolerance could easily get 2 or 3 doses from one bag. I probably could have done both bags in one shot and been nodding like I did 3 of our stuff. Stealth of package was great, blended in like regular mail. If someone in my house opened it they would not have found it but may have been suspicious of blank papers inside. Was hidden well enough that it took me a few shuffles through before I found it. Overall I was unhappy with the time it took to get and how long some of the sellers replies took but in his defense he did refund my order a few days before I got it and SR was down for a couple days and hard to log onto for several days around the shut down. My initial messages were answered within 24 hours but I was a real pain in the ass with all the question as a first time buyer. Was told I would get &#039;a little something extra&#039; for the shipping issues but only got what I ordered. I requested a coke sample since on the forums he was offering free samples but didn&#039;t get one. I got what I paid for but then got a full refund so in reality I got two free samples. For me and my tolerance I would need 1.5-2 bags for one shot and its simply not cost effective. This dope got the job done and may even be considered high quality in some areas. DT will do well on SR, he seems like he&#039;s trying to do a good job but started out with a few hiccups that I&#039;m sure he has worked out already. You can buy with confidence but be patient if you don&#039;t get express shipping. As I sample more of the dope on SR I&#039;ll have a better idea of whats available out there but as my first sample I was satisfied. Good luck DT!&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for the review

				I ordered from DT last week, chose the Express shipping option and showed up like clockwork two days later in despite of the fact that this was during the start of the current DDOS mess.&nbsp; Product is very good stuff for the money, and has some unique characteristics that are a world apart from what I am used to. Once it&#039;s back up he&#039;ll be getting a 5/5 from me, definitely.&nbsp;

				So just to put closure on my experience with DieselTherapy, my first order on SR. Although there were some problems with shipping that were not entirely his fault I feel that he did not ship as quickly as he could&#039;ve and even told me he did ship when he didn&#039;t. I did end up getting my order refunded (at his request) so I received two free bags. They were definitely fat and the potency was above average. They did taste alot more bitter than any dope I&#039;ve had, presumably the quinine cut. The amount of undissolved product after cooking up was acceptable, but there was some residue left in the cooker that the cotton didn&#039;t get so it wasn&#039;t the purest it could be. I have a high tolerance and shot a whole bag at once and got a nice rush and long lasting buzz that didn&#039;t put me out so I could enjoy it instead of nodding through it. I shot the other bag about 45 mins later and got another rush and went out to a festival and had a few beers and enjoyed the night. The legs were good and about 18hrs later the sniffles started.<br />Overall DieselTherapy is a good vendor. I think he still was working on getting his shipments out quickly but I&#039;m sure that he is doing his best and wants to have satisfied customers. The dope I got was above average quality (7.0) and the quantity was as much or more than stated. I live in a city with really good dope so a 7.0 here would be 8.5 most other places. I got dope from Terabitha that was not as good, but he knew it wasn&#039;t as good and is also reshipping me a few bags free of charge to make up for it. (It was a 5.5). The product I got from SupremeSmoke (1/2g of China White) was the best I&#039;ve gotten so far on SR (8.0) although I don&#039;t think its truly &#039;China White&#039; since it was an off-gray mostly powder with little rocks in it. The 1/2g lasted me two days and I got about 8shots out of it which although didn&#039;t give me a good initial rush, surely had me nodding hard. A shot for me is about 2 stamp bags so his 1/2gram is about 15 stamps bags worth. <br />&nbsp;So I&#039;m still traveling the Road trying to find the best dope. I tried to order from Freeway but he just dicked me around for a week before I asked him to refund my money so beware of him if you want to have you stuff shipped promptly. Supremesmoke only offers express shipping and I ordered thurs and got it sat to the east coast, truly express. His shit is a little overpriced I think but good quality and fast shipping. DieselTherapy sent my package on Wed and I got it Sat. Terabithia also sent me thurs and I got it sat priority mail. Opt for express mail if you can afford it and trust the vendor will ship right away then you will be getting your shit within 2 days. Good Luck and be safe and smart....

				I just wish he would read his messages. I ordered from him late night tuesday with express. He marked it as in transit on weds. As of today, friday, it did not arrive. I live in a major metropolitan area and first class packages arrive in 2-3 days, priority 1-2 and express always 1 day. He has not read any of my messages in more than 2 days and now I will be junk sick all weekend. I hope it was a minor mistake and he will look into it asap.
