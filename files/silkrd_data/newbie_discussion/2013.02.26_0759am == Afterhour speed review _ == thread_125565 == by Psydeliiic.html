				Have ordered 2x100g Speed and 10g Amnesia 5-7 days ago. Did FE since I know AH as a trusted vendor, I hope this was not the wrong action. Nothing arrives until today, beeing very unsatisfied.<br />Will update on Arrival. Had a probe of speed before and was very nice. Hope all goes well.

				Ordered 50g speed from AH recently, shipped in EU 8 days (6 working days). The product itself was overweight 56g approximately and a little wet/moisty, but not too much. The product was tested and seems to be like described, rather around the 55% mark. Unlike in the picture, the color was white. Strong smell and product 3x vaccuum packed.<br />Remember, amphetamine speed powder or paste, even pure, has never been tested above 73%, so overall 55-60% at this price is a fair deal.

				I am also very interested in hearing what people think of the quality of this speed.<br />Have been considering to make an order, but have been waiting for some reviews first.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=125565.msg961778#msg961778">Quote from: zamora on March 31, 2013, 11:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Remember, amphetamine speed powder or paste, even pure, has never been tested above 73%, so overall 55-60% at this price is a fair deal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In a sense you are both right and wrong about this.<br /><br />What most people do not realize is that amphetamine (and a lot of other drugs) can have 2 different forms.<br /><br />The form of amphetamine that we usually deal with is Amphetamine Sulphate. <br />Amphetamine Sulphate is essentially Amphetamine base, that we have attached to sulphate salt.<br /><br />The reason why we do this, is to make the Amphetamine water soluble, so the body can break it down easier.<br />This is exactly the same as with coke and crack (coke is attached to a hcl salt, so it can be snortet, and crack is a free base form that can instead be smoked).<br /><br />So when you say that amphetamine have never been tested above 73% you are talking about Amphetamine Sulphate, which consist of 73% Amphetamine base, and 27% Sulphate salt.<br /><br />I am not quite sure why the dutch labs choose to test this way as it only seems to confuse people, and the Amphetamine that is being traded and consumed is Amphetamine Sulphate in +95% of the cases.<br /><br />The truth is that 99% Amphetamine Sulphate will be tested as 73% Amphetamine base.<br /><br />I hope the above explanation makes sense as i am a little bit tweaked at the moment, and finding it hard to type as fast as i would like.<br />If you are having trouble understanding exactly what i am trying to explain, please feel free to ask, and i will try to clarify, to the best of my abilities.<br /><br />
