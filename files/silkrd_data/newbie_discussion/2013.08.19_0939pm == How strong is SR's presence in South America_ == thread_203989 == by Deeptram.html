				If you live in South America, how difficult is it to ship product from North America and Europe through customs? I haven&#039;t noticed a large presence of South American vendors, but are there any?

				There are a few, there&#039;s a dude named pepanimil , that spelling very well might be off, if I remember right he&#039;s from Peru and his game is C. There are others but not a lot because it&#039;s a hard part of the world to move product from, for obvious reasons. I would think it is much easier to get product down there from other parts of the world though.

				I&#039;m from South America and have been buying for quite some time now. 7 successful shipments and only one failed it trough the customs. <br />My orders usually come all the way from Holland, those orders always arrived (dispatched by uglydoll, a kickass vendor who sadly is leaving SR) and another two from Germany (two different vendors, one did not arrived). <br />Due to my experience I would say if proper packaging is used, the risks are minimal. The order that did not arrived was single vaccum sealed.<br />
