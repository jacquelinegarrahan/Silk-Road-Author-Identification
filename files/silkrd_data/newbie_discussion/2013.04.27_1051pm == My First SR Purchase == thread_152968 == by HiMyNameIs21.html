				Bought a quarter from XXXotica after reading a lot of reviews. Order should come in in a few days, and I&#039;m PUMPED.<br /><br />I bought the purple berry cause they were out of GDP, but thats allright. If the quality is good, ill probably get some GDP in a few weeks.<br /><br />Happy Toking!

				Hope it works out from you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />She only sells in g&#039;s and 1/8ths, but my first purchase was from Lexisadie. She&#039;s still around and is first class if your ever in need of another vendor. <br /><br />There are others that I could recommend, but she popped my cherry and I&#039;ve never heard a compliant about her. <br /><br />The last time I bought GDP on the road, it was fan-fucking-tastic
