				Personally I don&#039;t agree with the 50 post rule to be able to post on the main forums. It&#039;s been done to slow down the spammers but I believe there could have been more elegant ways to accomplish this.<br /><br />That said, it is what it is for now, so I&#039;ve created this thread where people with less than 50 posts can still post questions and comments about GHB in general and our product in particular. I will watch this thread and reply regularly.<br /><br />For reference, our main GHB Information, Best Practices and FAQ Page is here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0<br /><br />Any questions (not already covered in the FAQ) please ask away! And if it&#039;s a decent question or comment I&#039;ll give you some karma too :)<br /><br />BlueGiraffe

				Just chiming in to say that BG&#039;s GHB is the tits, and you shouldn&#039;t be buying from anyone else if you care about purity, as you really should with this product.<br /><br />GHB is everything that alcohol is, except better and with very little chance of having a bad night.

				I havnt tried your GHB yet, but I got into GHB lately and must say, I really like it. But it´s rather a stay-home-and-chill drug to me.

But if you take it in moderate doses with a stimulant, entactogen or psychedelic, it is awesome to dance on - and can actually be very &quot;up&quot; if you dose it right.<br /><br />Falling asleep on a large dose of GHB can cause rebound waking 4-5 hours later on. The way to manage this is to take a slightly lower dose, or take a high dose but build it up slowly instead of taking a large single dose (and this is more pleasurable in any case).<br /><br />BG

Some people dilute 1g in 5ml - which I think is somewhat common. But really it&#039;s impossible to say. Whoever is selling the liquid should be able to tell you straight (assuming they&#039;re on it).<br /><br />Of course if the liquid was made as a liquid, and has never been a powder, then it may be a little harder for the vendor to tell.<br /><br />BG

				Hey BG,<br />Been reading for a while about GHB and have been very very interested in purchasing, yet I&#039;m having a hard time buying BTCs as I just moved recently. Would LOVE to take advantage of your BLISSEDOUTBLUEGIRAFFEPOD promotion but I doubt I&#039;ll be able to get the BTCs sorted by tomorrow, hopefully next week. Any chance of an extension :/? If there&#039;s anything that can be done please PM me.<br />Anyhow, to my questions:<br />1. What would be a decent amount to purchase for, say, a 2 month supply? (I know this is VERY subjective question, but in your highly trusted opinion, what would you recommend)<br />2. How do the anti-depressive properties from GHB compare/differ from those of Ketamine? Could you possibly comment as to how they weigh against each other? (I know you are an expert with GHB and perhaps not at all on K, but I&#039;m taking my chances in asking the question as it really sparks my curiosity that both drugs have claims that they are great for this purpose. Just want to add that I have tried K a handful of times for recreational purposes at low doses, not k-holing, but not at the sub-threshold dose that&#039;s recommended for taking advantage of these anti-dep properties.)<br /><br />That&#039;s all I have in mind for the moment, I&#039;m certain if you address these more questions will come up haha. Thanks mate.

Would LOVE to take advantage of your BLISSEDOUTBLUEGIRAFFEPOD promotion but I doubt I&#039;ll be able to get the BTCs sorted by tomorrow, hopefully next week. Any chance of an extension :/? If there&#039;s anything that can be done please PM me.<br />Anyhow, to my questions:<br />1. What would be a decent amount to purchase for, say, a 2 month supply? (I know this is VERY subjective question, but in your highly trusted opinion, what would you recommend)<br />2. How do the anti-depressive properties from GHB compare/differ from those of Ketamine? Could you possibly comment as to how they weigh against each other? (I know you are an expert with GHB and perhaps not at all on K, but I&#039;m taking my chances in asking the question as it really sparks my curiosity that both drugs have claims that they are great for this purpose. Just want to add that I have tried K a handful of times for recreational purposes at low doses, not k-holing, but not at the sub-threshold dose that&#039;s recommended for taking advantage of these anti-dep properties.)<br /><br />That&#039;s all I have in mind for the moment, I&#039;m certain if you address these more questions will come up haha. Thanks mate.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can&#039;t do an extension my friend. It&#039;s a rule I stick to with these kind of things. So sorry...<br /><br />To answer your questions:<br /><br />1. Very subjective question! And impossible to answer really :) Totally depends on how you&#039;re using it. Daily as an anti-depressant or partying on weekends. Are you sharing it? Etc etc... Get a 100g, good size stash to have.<br /><br />2. I do have extensive experience with Ketamine, but all high dose use. I do not know about the efficacy of taking sub-threshold doses for depression. Doesn&#039;t strike me that it would be effective in the way GHB is.<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				BlueGiraffe, I can&#039;t thank you enough! I&#039;m a 28 year old male. When I was 17, I started drinking. After my first taste, I was hooked. Since then, I&#039;ve been drinking about 1/2 bottle of 80 proof/40% hard liquor (in the US I think a bottle is 750ml, not sure if it&#039;s the same in the UK where you are) on work days and 1/2 a handle (I think a handle is 1.75 liters) on days off. I start drinking, on days off, as soon as I wake up and continue until I go to bed. I also frequently wake up to pee, and then I have a few more sips before going back to bed. On work days, I drink as soon as I get off and I also frequently call in sick so I can stay home and drink.<br /><br />Recently, I started to have some abdominal discomfort/pain. I also experienced something else strange: I had just one shot and immediately threw up. I haven&#039;t puked since I was 18 or 19. I don&#039;t have health insurance so I couldn&#039;t see a Dr. I did some research, and my best guess is that I have alcoholic hepatitis or full blown cirrhosis. I also read about famous folks who have died of alcoholism. One of my idols, Jack Kerouac, died of alcoholism. He was taken to the hospital because of abdominal pain and promptly died. I had always planned on drinking myself to death, but when it got real, I realized that I wanted to live.<br /><br />At this point I did some research. I had tried substituting benzos for booze, but tolerance built up too quickly. Then, I realized that booze and benzos both mediate their effects through the GABA-A receptors (booze also works on other receptors, but that&#039;s a subject for another day.) Then, I found out that GHB works on the GABA-B receptors (amongst others). I realized that if I alternated benzos with GHB, I could avoid building a tolerance to either.<br /><br />So far, my abdominal pain has diminished and I haven&#039;t had a drink. I&#039;m hoping it will go away entirely.<br /><br />Still, booze is my all-time favorite drug. Nothing in the world compares to that first drink--the narcotic euphoria, the warm, cuddly sensation that emanates from my stomach through out my entire body, the feeling that nothing matters...I prefer alcohol to sex, to friends, to work...the only thing I like more than booze is being alive. I would sacrifice anything for a drink, anything except my life. I feel I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I can choose either life or alcohol, but not both. If I keep drinking, I will probably die very soon.<br /><br />In my opinion, nothing compares to alcohol (and I&#039;ve tried everything under the sun from LSD to Ketamine to opiates of all types to cocaine etc.), but GHB and benzos at least allow me to keep my life.<br /><br />Thanks BG--for your helpful tutorials, your excellent product, you great customer service, and for risking your own freedom to supply me with medicine. I credit you, in part, for saving my life.

				BG or others - i dont find it ever produces any sort of pro sexual effects. ive only ever used bg&#039;s ghb though<br /><br />i always took it to the level my vision was altered like i was drunk - do higher dosages remove the pro-sexual effect for most users? should i be using less?<br /><br />its certainly good for promoting restful sleep! apart from timing considerations due to the &quot;party before the sleep&quot; effect i get it definately would outdo benzos used responsibly

But the other week, hubby and I were both having trouble sleeping and dosed with some ghb. He had a much harder time falling asleep so I thought I&#039;d help with a hand-job (I was falling asleep, it was the best I could offer!). In any case, he starts getting so aroused that he starts moaning. This in turn starts to excite me and before I know it I&#039;m rolling my face off. I didn&#039;t even think I could roll on ghb like that! <br /><br />So I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s an issue of setting. If you&#039;re already romantic or slightly aroused, ghb can build on that. But if you have nothing, it has nothing to enhance. Anyway, that&#039;s what I got out of that one experience. I haven&#039;t had a chance to test it since but let me know if you do.

				Dear blue furred long necked friend,<br /><br />I never read much about GHB before acidentally seeing your thread and I got VERY curious. You seem to provide us fellow SRes a very nice powdery way of feeling good and I have to try it.<br />Relatively safe, sort of like alcohol but without hangover and some sexy effect? Count me in!<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to having some not so cool times lately, I&#039;ve been taking 150mg of Venlafaxine daily for some time by docs reccommendation. I started with 75mg and it was fine, I even lasted a little longer, wich was nice. When I increased to 150mg it decreased my libido a little, not so cool but probabbly gonna keep on it for a little longer to see how it goes.<br /><br />Is it safe to take GHB while taking Venlafaxine (or any other SSRI/SNRI)? Anything else I should know about the mix or it wont have any interaction?<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />BG. (whow, just realized we&#039;ve got the same initials!)

				Hello Everyone and Every One! :)<br /><br />Firstly, my apologies...<br /><br />I have not been on the forums at all for some months as I&#039;ve just not had the bandwidth to run the whole customer service and order process, and also maintain an active presence on the forums. And of course there is all the rest of Life apart from Silk Road that requires attention and responsibility.<br /><br />I have truly missed our conversations and I am very happy to be back! And a big thank you to all of you (you know who you are) who have maintained the integrity and professionalism of this little corner of the SR Forums. I am very grateful...<br /><br />I am happy to report that the reason I will now be able to be active on the forums again is because the lovely SilverFox (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=68424) has joined our team to manage the customer service and order processing cycle :)<br /><br />Some of you have probably already met here. She is experienced, competent and capable and truly a delight to work with (chosen out of thousands!) and I am certain you will have an excellent experience with her. She is one of us. (If you want to know a bit more about this lovely lady... http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156118.0)<br /><br />Furthermore, I am also pleased to report that the recent time away has allowed me to expend some energy on creative R&amp;D in the lab. The fruits of this labour are two-fold:<br /><br />1. We will, within days, be listing a 50/50 Na/K GHB (balanced mix of Sodium and Potassium GHB salts)! We are very pleased with our results. Potassium GHB is more hygroscopic, is a bitch to crystallize properly and has significantly lower yields than Sodium GHB, but we have perfected our process and have produced a beautiful dry white fluffy powder (of exquisite purity of course) that is a joy to handle and take. I will discuss more about the benefits and subtle distinctions of this product shortly in another post. (Na-GHB and K-GHB are not the same thing!)<br /><br />2. We are in an advanced stage of set up to be able to supply consistently large volumes of the finest, full-spectrum, balanced Mescaline complex the world has ever seen. Right from soil and water specification and quality control, through excellent and time-tested cultivars of both T. pachanoi and T. peruvianus, sacred cultivation methods, and highly conscious and attuned extraction protocols, we are putting this one together with utmost care. As above, I will be making a dedicated post and new thread about this product shortly. Suffice to say, this will be the absolute business!! (And did I mention how exquisitely Mescaline and GHB combine?? Well I will soon - they like each other very much ;))<br /><br />I will be starting to work through all the posts that require a response (though I see that many of them have been covered better than I could have!) and I wish to thank those of you that have been waiting, for your patience and indulgence...<br /><br />Love and Blessings to you all!<br /><br />Your BlueGiraffe<br />

Alcohol potentiates GHB a lot though so be careful with those two, maybe it&#039;s also so strong with ketamine.. I think you should try low doses first when doing ketamine and GHB to know if you can handle it or not. Low doses of each shouldn&#039;t be bad but as a general rule, you shouldn&#039;t mix downers with ketamine.

				I have tried GBL before but never GHB. Apparently they&#039;re both quite different in terms of effect, despite GBL being a precursor. GBL is a horrible drug in my opinion, partly because of the potential damage it can do to your body (and mind) but GHB seems much more refined. When it appeared, it was described as &quot;liquid ecstacy&quot;, though i&#039;m not sure if there is any accuracy in that description (seems like a media invention).<br />One thing to bear in mind is the drugs addictive potential. The withdrawl symptoms are said to be tortuous, with a massive dopamine rush. So be careful peeps!!!

I&#039;m a 28 year old male. When I was 17, I started drinking. After my first taste, I was hooked. Since then, I&#039;ve been drinking about 1/2 bottle of 80 proof/40% hard liquor (in the US I think a bottle is 750ml, not sure if it&#039;s the same in the UK where you are) on work days and 1/2 a handle (I think a handle is 1.75 liters) on days off. I start drinking, on days off, as soon as I wake up and continue until I go to bed. I also frequently wake up to pee, and then I have a few more sips before going back to bed. On work days, I drink as soon as I get off and I also frequently call in sick so I can stay home and drink.<br /><br />Recently, I started to have some abdominal discomfort/pain. I also experienced something else strange: I had just one shot and immediately threw up. I haven&#039;t puked since I was 18 or 19. I don&#039;t have health insurance so I couldn&#039;t see a Dr. I did some research, and my best guess is that I have alcoholic hepatitis or full blown cirrhosis. I also read about famous folks who have died of alcoholism. One of my idols, Jack Kerouac, died of alcoholism. He was taken to the hospital because of abdominal pain and promptly died. I had always planned on drinking myself to death, but when it got real, I realized that I wanted to live.<br /><br />At this point I did some research. I had tried substituting benzos for booze, but tolerance built up too quickly. Then, I realized that booze and benzos both mediate their effects through the GABA-A receptors (booze also works on other receptors, but that&#039;s a subject for another day.) Then, I found out that GHB works on the GABA-B receptors (amongst others). I realized that if I alternated benzos with GHB, I could avoid building a tolerance to either.<br /><br />So far, my abdominal pain has diminished and I haven&#039;t had a drink. I&#039;m hoping it will go away entirely.<br /><br />Still, booze is my all-time favorite drug. Nothing in the world compares to that first drink--the narcotic euphoria, the warm, cuddly sensation that emanates from my stomach through out my entire body, the feeling that nothing matters...I prefer alcohol to sex, to friends, to work...the only thing I like more than booze is being alive. I would sacrifice anything for a drink, anything except my life. I feel I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I can choose either life or alcohol, but not both. If I keep drinking, I will probably die very soon.<br /><br />In my opinion, nothing compares to alcohol (and I&#039;ve tried everything under the sun from LSD to Ketamine to opiates of all types to cocaine etc.), but GHB and benzos at least allow me to keep my life.<br /><br />Thanks BG--for your helpful tutorials, your excellent product, you great customer service, and for risking your own freedom to supply me with medicine. I credit you, in part, for saving my life.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey pseudanon (bow)<br /><br />Sorry for only responding now - have been off the forums for a bit and just starting to catch up on posts now.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you for posting what you did. I have great respect for what you are doing and for how you&#039;re intelligently applying this protocol as you are (and yes GABA-B is it!). And truly don&#039;t mention it! I do this as it&#039;s totally natural for me - unavoidable really :)&nbsp; Happy that it is serving. GHB is truly a blessed substance and has great utility - especially in situations such as yours. <br /><br />It was banned because, being a natural substance, it cannot be patented (and thus owned). So it&#039;s availability does not serve the pharmaceutical powers-that-be. Well fuck that, we&#039;ll make sure that it&#039;s always available (and our spec is higher than Xyrem BTW). I&#039;m always very moved at heart when I read a story such as your own - thank you so much for sharing!<br /><br />When we release our full-spectrum Mescaline complex shortly, may I suggest that you consider experimenting with taking small doses of this with the GHB from time to time (with which it combines exquisitely). It has an ability to seep deep into the psyche and the bone marrow and support the journey that you are on. Great Blessings to you!<br /><br />Respect,<br /><br />BG

				Although I dissed GBL, there was certainly something pleasurable about the effects. I don&#039;t like alcohol but this was similar but better, if you know what I mean.

				+1 for asking the first question!<br /><br />For those that are uber particular about their health, maintaining the electrolyte balance (between sodium and potassium) in the body is a good thing. Na-GHB on its own adds to the body&#039;s sodium levels (which in any case tend to be a little higher than they should be due to the high processed-food diet of most people these days).<br /><br />Adding K-GHB in at a 50/50 ratio brings approximately an equal amount of potassium into the body (which most people are deficient in because they don&#039;t eat all their greens), so altogether this has a health benefit.<br /><br />The amount of sodium added to the body from occasional (and even regular) Na-GHB use is pretty marginal (like sprinkling double the salt on your fries), but from an ideal health perspective it can be improved upon. So we did :)<br /><br />Interestingly as well, while K-GHB and Na-GHB &quot;should&quot; be identical from a pharmacological perspective, they aren&#039;t! It&#039;s subtle, but K-GHB definitely manifests more in the mind and emotions, and somewhat less in the body. Both Na-GHB and K-GHB are empathic but K-GHB is slightly more so, and it also seems slightly more stimulating, and makes for great deep conversation and lively discourse - definitely seems to open the pysche a bit more than the Na-GHB.<br /><br />Conversely Na-GHB feels more in the body, more raunchy, disinhibited and slobbery :)&nbsp; So Na-GHB is probably nicer for passionate sweaty uninhibited fucking, and K-GHB nicer for deep heart-to-heart conversations and social interactions. They&#039;re both GHB in everyway of course too - but this distinction is definitely noticeable. The 50/50 combo really works nicely bringing these aspects together.<br /><br />K-GHB is slightly more bitter tasting than Na-GHB which is just mildly salty. It is also slightly more hygroscopic than Na-GHB, but in the blend it appears not to be a problem at all. Finally K-GHB is about 13% weaker by weight than Na-GHB, so the 50/50 blend is about 6.5% weaker than straight Na-GHB. Very minor, but you may wish to account for it in your measuring.<br /><br />Yields are are quite a bit lower with the K-GHB and it&#039;s a total bitch to crystallize properly, so more lab time involved in making it - hence the higher price. Most people will probably use the Na-GHB as their staple but also have the 50/50 on hand for when they want to tweak the mood in that direction. Of course the serious health freaks who want to get more heart-protecting potassium in their diet from their &quot;drug&quot; use will probably enjoy this as well!<br /><br />BG

This is perfect. I didn&#039;t see much in the original dosage thread about mixing with water, but that makes sense now. So you say to not mix with water for storage. If someone was to mix with water to take on a plane, seems as though liquid would look less suspicious than a baggy of powder... How long do you think it would be ok to keep? A few days, a week?<br />

Please ask whatever questions you need to and I will always be happy to respond. That&#039;s what I&#039;m here for!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />For a start, read this post by BlueGiraffe:<br /><br />*Art of Dosing Tutorial: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.msg717324;topicseen#msg717324<br /><br />Water is fine (preferably filtered or distilled) to mix it in for dosing. You can also use orange, grapefruit, apple or tomato juice (GHB is a bit salty so they all go well with it). <br /><br />The powder to liquid ratio is up to you. MeGrimlock&#039;s page is perfectly correct for bulk mixing as you are not limited to just 5ml per dose - so, for example, if you want to take 1.5g on your first dose you simply measure out 7.5ml of the mix. You can also just measure out your powder and mix it into a wine glass of water - it really depends on your preference and tolerance level, so it&#039;s just a matter of experimenting...<br /><br />For storage it&#039;s not recommended to mix it into water. Most prefer to keep it in powder form, sealed in a couple of airtight bags in a well-sealed plastic or glass bottle at room temperature - not the fridge. GHB is hygroscopic and will absorb moisture from the atmosphere very easily and you don&#039;t want to end up with a gooey mess, so make it as airtight as possible. <br /><br />Please let me know if you still have questions&nbsp; :)<br /><br />SFX<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you. This is perfect. I didn&#039;t see much in the original dosage thread about mixing with water, but that makes sense now. So you say to not mix with water for storage. If someone was to mix with water to take on a plane, seems as though liquid would look less suspicious than a baggy of powder... How long do you think it would be ok to keep? A few days, a week?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s my pleasure.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; For long term storage powder is best, but some do mix with water and seem happy with the results as you can tell by MeGrimlock&#039;s advice. As he recommends mixing 100g GHB into 500mls of water this indicates that it keeps well. A few days to a week will be totally fine. For travelling purposes a baggy of powder in my luggage would make my fur stand on end, so I understand where you&#039;re coming from!!<br /><br />

My humblest apologies. I was in the midst of replying yesterday when, well, life happened and I had to save it for today.<br /><br />And, yes, thanks CUPIDO for stepping in...<br /><br />So to answer your questions:<br />--<br />What is the best way to prepare for a situation when one is at a club or at a friends house (without scale)?<br />Weighing and mixing with water beforehand? Using vials?<br />Is the concentration of the GHB in the liquid evenly distributed?<br />Or does it have the tendency to settle down etc.<br />--<br />Preparation for a friend&#039;s house or club boils down to personal preference that comes from experience really. <br /><br />CUPIDO prefers weighing out powder beforehand to avoid possibly overdosing someone with a pre-mixed liquid. If this powder option feels like a good idea then try it. The spoon we provide measures out approximately 1g if it&#039;s level, not packed tightly and lightly shaken.<br /><br />For a public situation where discretion is required a pre-measure dose in water is best. The vials sound handy and this would address the concern of taking too much. They could also be a mission to carry around and a little suspect, but this depends on you and how many you are intending to mix up. Ratio of powder to liquid is up to you, but a good amount of water is better for taste and accuracy of dosing.<br /><br />GHB dissolves completely into water. Yes, it should stay evenly distributed as it is solution, but always good to give a little shake anyway.<br /><br />SFX

It&#039;s our pleasure.<br /><br />When you say air tight I&#039;m imagining you squeezed the air out of the bag as much as possible and sealed it. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve read that GHB is hygroscopic by nature and will happily suck the moisture from the atmosphere within a very short space of time, so air tight is the key. Just mentioning again for the sake of clarity...<br /><br />BG simply stores his powder in a sealed vitamin bottle without the bag and he is happy with that. So you could try taking it out of the bag and storing directly in the bottle.<br /><br />Further water absorption is preventable by storing better. To prevent this happening in future try the following:<br /><br />*** Some silica gel sachets popped in to the bag will help with any moisture trapped in the bag after sealing...<br /><br />*** Another option is to add another layer - so re-bag it - super airtight. Then put that bag into another bag - again, super air tight. Then the bottle - you could stretch a piece of plastic over the opening of the bottle before screwing the lid on. Plastic pill bottle is fine.<br /><br />As to why it absorbed moisture in the first place - it happens. Little moisture gremlins in the bag. I&#039;m sure it was just the tiniest of air leaks or absorption that happened before you managed to seal it. You just need to experiment with your storage.<br /><br />Let me know how you go! And looking forward to providing you with more of our fine wares ;)<br /><br />SFX

				BlueGiraffe is heroic. 100%<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m a little biased because I never tried GHB before BG. I had heard a bit about it but no one I hang with has ever tried it so I decided to do my own research. Once I decided GHB was safe enough, I got curious and decided to play BG&#039;s lotto after researching him on the forums and whatnot. <br /><br />1,2,3.. Winner!<br /><br />100g!!<br /><br />He sent me a friendly message and my GHB was delivered timely.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />From the very first try on my own (following BG&#039;s recommendations for dosing) I had an AMAZING time. Personally I experience almost 0 tolerance build and only a brief light headache the next morning if I redose once or more and end up taking 4g+ to make the experience last longer. One thing to note is my friend who is a ~125lbs F needed HALF the dose I did (175lb M) to get similar effects. She was happy chilling with 1g even. So just as BG says start light and find your own dosage.<br /><br />Damn I feel like I stumbled upon a treasure chest. Awesome stuff! I just have to restrain myself and make it last a while since I&#039;m not rich. GHB goes great with most of the other drugs I like too, since I don&#039;t really go for depressants usually (mostly psychs). Even 1mg klon meant I was taking less GHB and getting more tired.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only downside to me, getting tired. I usually fall asleep fine but I will wake up in 4 hrs if I fall asleep with depressants in my system. <br /><br />But I love coffee so that helps.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />BlueGiraffe ftw!! If you have never tried GHB give it some research because I like it way better than alcohol (eww).
