				Whats up guys :) How is everyone?<br /><br />Been quite bored lately since I finished all my &quot;stuff&quot; from SR and waiting for some 25i NBOMe&#039;s to come around this weekend or next week most probably... So I&#039;ve got a few questions and am a stimulant virgin.<br /><br />I hear that for Amphetamine paste, you just take some out, break it out with a card or something and let it dry, then just snort, bomb or apply to gums... I was wondering, is it possible to chase the dragon with Amphetamine speed and is it worth it?<br /><br />Yaba in translation is &quot;madness drug&quot; or &quot;crazy drug&quot;, its a common drug in Thailand and in its pill form contains Methamphetamine and Caffeine... I was curious if any vendors in SR sell any?<br /><br />And, understanding that everything should be taken in moderation and responsibly, which would you recommend, Meth or Amphetamine? I just want something to give me some euphoria, to let the day go by and also be able to read and maybe study if taken in small amounts... <br /><br />Gah i&#039;m so impatient when it comes to deliveries.. oh well!

				I have seen Yabba for sale, try using the market search engine.<br />I would defo recommend starting with speed/amps if you&#039;re new to stims. It&#039;s dangerous in itself, but starting with Meth as your first ever stimulant is asking for trouble.<br />Don&#039;t bother with trying to smoke speed paste. If you can&#039;t be bothered to wait for it to dry, just bomb/parachute it.<br /><br />

				finally a meth topic comes and I&#039;m not sure about my answer... I think speed paste can be smoked ,but tastes terrible and destroys glass tubes fast. If smoking is your method then go with the meth and good luck getting the best and not getting scammed ... peace.

				The only type of speed designed for smoking is freebase. Never seen that on the road. Would be a welcome addition come to think about it ;D

				You can rub it in your gums if you like, but this is easier with speed powder. I still say try out 50mg, by putting it in a rizla and swallowing it with water. Don&#039;t do too much though if it&#039;s your first time! Be safe!! And drink lots of fluid while you&#039;re speeding - water or fruit juice. Hope this helps!

				Much appreciate Garrincha! I think i&#039;ll try snorting it first, I always preferred insufflation, but definitely swallowing bombs for a steadier, long lasting trip. Cheers!

				If you want to snort it, you will have to dry it out first, to turn it into powder. I have never done this myself, but have heard that spreading the paste on a plate and putting the plate on a radiator is the best method. Even if you keep it in the bag, it will dry out naturally after a few days anyway. Good luck, whichever method you decide upon! :)
