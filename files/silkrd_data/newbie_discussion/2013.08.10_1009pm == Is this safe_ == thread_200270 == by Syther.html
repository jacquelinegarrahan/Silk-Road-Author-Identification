				Hi, thanks for reading, I&#039;m gonna try and keep this quick for you guys.<br />So basically I want to start buying (and once I harvest in october, selling too, but let&#039;s not get too far ahead of ourselves) on silk road. I downloaded bitcoin QT and managed to create 2 wallets on my desktop computer by moving the wallet.dat to a sub folder and then interchanging that file and the new wallet.dat that was created.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done quite a bit of reading into how bitcoins work and masking their path etc and decided on a plan that I thought would allow me to buy easily yet remain anon:<br />Just buy bitcoins from mt. gox normally with a verified account and send it to my first wallet, then send those bitcoins to my second wallet, then to the seller, and at some point - either between the first and second wallet, or after the second wallet - use a generic bit-washing service so the bitcoins aren&#039;t associated with me that are going to the drug seller.<br /><br /><br />I thought this would be enough because I plan on only ever buying under a half ounce of weed, a few LSD tabs or 50 or less ecstasy pills. But then I came across a few threads that talked about GPG and Liberte, and about how they had and OS then an encrypted virtual OS (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0) - is this level of precaution necessary? Also, what is the encryption needed for, why not send a normal message via SR? I feel like a total noob against these guys.<br /><br />Also, if it makes a difference, my bitcoin wallets are set to use the SOCKS proxy within the bition QT programme.<br />Sorry for the noobieness, we all have to start somewhere!

				I&#039;m still learning on making sure to cover all my tracks as well. A flash drive might help when it comes to your wallets. At least hackers can&#039;t steal your coins if you do something like that

				Well I encrypted the wallets using the pass phrase encryption that&#039;s built into the program for both wallets, but I&#039;m not really worried about hackers really - especially since I&#039;ll just be another small time holder of bitcoins/buyer, nothing significant in a hacker&#039;s eyes - it&#039;s just purchasing and using bitcoins that I&#039;m worried about

				Ain&#039;t nothing but something to do.<br /><br />If the po-po cone knocking on your door deny, deny, deny.<br /><br />If they catch you with a spike in your arm, shooting up the junk you just bought, deny, deny, deny.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Hopefully.

				Use PGP and if you are moving a lot of coins around make sure to tumble them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it safe?&nbsp; It is until it isn&#039;t, make sure the people you do business with aren&#039;t idiots as best you can.

				Use PGP for releasing sensitive data, such as your address.<br /><br />The reason for this is that if this site is ever physically located the governments who find it will be able to see all the messages, if they are encrypted in PGP they won&#039;t ever see your address.<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t use PGP, and release your own name and address, at some point they may be able to find you and bust your ass.

				Ah okay, that makes sense. I&#039;ll start learning how to do that then.<br />But do you think my plan of buying bitcoins with my bank, then sending them to a second wallet and washing them somewhere along the line will work?

				It&#039;s allways a good idea to encrypt sensityive data.<br />gpg4usb is very simple to use, takes 10 mins to get accustomed to. I think it works on multiple OSes<br />

				Your plan is fine. Use PGP for sending your address encrypted though.

				surely by sending the bitcoins to or from silk road you are essentially washing them? isnt this why this all works??<br />and surely buying contaraband from the internet and sending your address to complete strangers is never safe!
