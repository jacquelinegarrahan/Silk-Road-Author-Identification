				i keep reading about noobs falling for scams and losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars so some real easy ways to avoid getting scammed are....<br /><br />DONT FE. you dont know who is on the other side of that screen therefore you shouldnt be trusting them. the escrow feature is set up for the sole purpose of protecting the buyer from getting ripped off SO USE IT.<br /><br />if its too good to be true - it probably is. do you really think a pound of top shelf weed is going to sell for 2,000? it isnt. if you want to test the waters buy a small amount first, and even then - DONT FE - ESPECIALLY on big orders. <br /><br />do your homework. this forum has tons of reviews on numerous vendors, find someone who is legitimate and established. theres new vendors on this website all the time, a lot of them probably aren&#039;t scammers at all but that doesn&#039;t mean you need to be the first person to buy from them. <br /><br />theres always going to be a risk with this kind of buying but you can very easily minimize it by following simple guidlines. <br /><br />p.s. DON&#039;T FE!<br /><br />edit: a lot of scammers will push for you to finalize early despite saying they will never require you to FE. &#039;hey my dog is sick i really need to get the coins&quot; &quot;the bitcoin market is very volatile&quot; &quot;ill give you a discount next time&quot;.&nbsp; vendors have the option to hedge their orders so they dont lose OR gain money with orders. if they are really concerned they will hedge their orders. you assume all risks the same as the vendor does with BTC value fluctuations, don&#039;t be guilted into FE. again, escrow is for your protection so use it. if you&#039;re new just stick to the script.
