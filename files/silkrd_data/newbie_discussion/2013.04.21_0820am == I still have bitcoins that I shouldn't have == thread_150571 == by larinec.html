				Definitely woudn&#039;t spend it, sounds like&nbsp; glich of some sort or a misunderstanding or malfucntion on the sellers side perhaps?&nbsp; if you bought something and there are no systemic problems with SR, then you&#039;re just gonna have to pay it anyhow, I mean, that&#039; the right thing to do after all.&nbsp; SR Support with point you the right direction, although it could take a day or two to get it resolved so don&#039;t think they aren&#039;t getting back to if you haven&#039;t received a reply in a day or two.&nbsp; From what I understand they&#039;re always busy, since SR is &quot;well&quot;, &quot;always&quot; open.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />J
