				hA....NUTS for sure. I had like 40 bucks in my account and now it&#039;s up to 140. Makes me wish i left like 500 in there and let it grow. It&#039;s like investing in stocks to make money to buy drugs. God bless the bitcoin market.

				this should really be working out for everyone right now.&nbsp; Buyers can just hold on to coins for a week and get a nice discount, and sellers, by the time they receive payment have quite a bit more than what they asked for for their product.&nbsp; I like the way things are going right now.&nbsp; I have made an extra 2000+ dollars just by holding off on buying for 2 weeks.

				econ 101<br /><br />like balltripper said... google supple demand graph, but the basic premise is that as supply goes up, demand goes down, and vice versa. right now demand is high but supply is limited!

				Mining difficulty has been increasing as miners miners have been increasing hashrate using ASICs. Since it&#039;s profitable for them, they can reinvest in more equipment, increasing hashrate even further. As this happens difficulty increases to balance it out. This increases the investment needed to begin mining, which makes bitcoins more scarce. Imagine how cheap gold would be if everybody could dig it up in their back yard.<br /><br />Once the hashrate starts to level off that &quot;scarcity&quot; will level as well, and the BTC price will level out. However once it levels miners will likely want to cash out earnings since they are no longer making money. Additionally, on sites like SR more people will hedge transactions in USD since there will be no benefit in keeping BTC. This could cause BTC to drop, causing more people to cash out. Mining may become unprofitable for some, causing miners to stop mining, and lowering difficulty.<br /><br />Whether or not BTC crashes will depend upon liquidity. As long as people are still buying BTC for transactions, there should be enough liquidity to maintain confidence. However, if there is not enough liquidity in the market to cover miners and investors selling off then the price will certainly fall drastically.
