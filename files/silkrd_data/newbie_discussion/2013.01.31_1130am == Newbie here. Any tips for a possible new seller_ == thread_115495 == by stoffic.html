				I would like to start selling prescription drugs, and possibly other things. I know I can base the prices off of what other sellers are letting them go for, and I know to do things like not leaving my actual return address, but what other advice can you give? What kind of packaging should I use? What should I send it through? How can I make sure people pay, and don&#039;t just say they never received the item all of the time?

				I suggest you read and search the forums for a MINIMUM of a month before you start even spending a penny on anything. This place has plenty of opportunity, but is dangerous to those that have slim margins. First thing you need to do is determine how you will cash out coins so that you can keep your supply chain fed. Remember the art of good business is being a good middleman.<br /><br />-BV

But at the same time our service isn&#039;t set up middle maned which is why I blow the competition prices outta the water. Oh and because I&#039;m not a filthy greedy fuck(We give profits to Registered 501c charities) . I can&#039;t give you mine but I will give you hints. You need to read up on all different kinds of &quot;Money Laundering&quot; methods used throughout the last 30-40 years. See how you could adapt things and I think you will more than likely see one of the many methods we use. Diversification is key though. Never cash out so much that if you lost it you would be killing your biz. Move it around in ways. Just remember making btc liquid will cost you high %&#039;s. You need to factor in a LOT of things before you vend here. This is not the place to fuck up on any of your game. If you are USA feel free to pm me any ideas YOU have and I will help you without the forum seeing it. I will poke holes in it and piss you off but you really do want me or others to see your mistakes before you make them. Best part is I point out how people are wrong for FREE&nbsp; :P.<br /><br />-BV

				Jesus of rave offers a package entitled something like &#039;beginners guide to vending on SR&#039; and so forth for a decent price considering the wealth of knowledge a top vendor like him must have.<br /><br />Check his listings out to see if your interested.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/53555a9222
