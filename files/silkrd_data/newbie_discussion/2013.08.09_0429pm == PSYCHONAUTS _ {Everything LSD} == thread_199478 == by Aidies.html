				Ive been trying to get another section opened up for discussion of LSD&nbsp; here on the &quot;Newbie&quot; boards...Not discounting the avengers thread but it seems to be over flowing with extraneous info...plus - Im sure there are plenty of people on this end who have been on the road for some time just never signed up or cared for forums so may only post in the 50 and under. <br /><br />If anyone has any reviews on Alaska Id love to read...hes been rising to the ranks and am planning to check him out soon....<br /><br />**(anyways here are a couple short reviews of great LSD vendors...unfortunately some have gone on break but hopefully will make their return sometime soon). <br /><br /><br /><br />JANNIS dolphins about 120-130ug are some of the best Ive ever done...Although light (doesnt pack the punch of say Mahakalas 180s or even TESS wow tabs) it seemed to put everything in perspective --a clarity of thought and mind that was exhilarating.plus there was seemingly no transition into the trip...the effects flowed on in with ease, as if youv&#039;e always felt this way .... Hopefully Jannis will make a comeback sometime soon...<br /><br />MAHAKALA&nbsp; He was my first - my reintroduction into LSD...and it was glorious. I had one of his candies...bought on a late night whim with just enough for one... after that I continued to explore the psychedelic route.... his dali lamas- candies- 2cb and mescaline are all superior quality. Like Jannis he does not have any listings currently...surely hell return sometime soon.<br /><br />TESS: The white on white - the look of construction board- these were also excellent. The transition in was a bit harsher than the previous two but it was well worth it. Like a Mhakala trip- Tess&#039;s also made everything look like an intricate pattern...a layer of interconnected pieces that covered the earth. i felt overwhelmingly positive and hopeful...very good experience.<br /><br />HollandOnline: I tried his double-sided hoffmans when he was still open to U.S buyers...I tried with a group of people and it was divided...almost- exactly- half felt nothing...I included...the rest felt what was described as something comparable to Jannis...light but wonderful. <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />*Also if anyone is into psychedelics but also takes suboxen please feel free to comment.... I take a miniscule dose on a daily basis for over two years now.... does not interfere with LSD but towards the end of a trip i usually have to take an extra piece--withdrawals start to set in. <br />

				I love me so psychoactives...<br />So far only tried KittenHuffer, currently trying to make a transaction with FartBomber.<br />Gonna buy some MDMA too, but I don&#039;t know how psychedelic that is considered, never tried it.<br /><br />Gonna do one mdma &quot;trip&quot;, and three candyflips. Wish me luck :)<br /><br />oh, and kittenhuffer had damn legit stuff, same as fartbomber they say (fartbomber supplies kittenhuffer afaik). Fast shipping and good enough stealth, but I think it is slightly off imo, just me being paranoid.

				Try throwing rocks in the water in under the moon.<br />You cant tell if the water goes up or down, and you can&#039;t see the stone since it&#039;s dark.<br />Pretty amazing and great to do if you can&#039;t sit around (&lt;--- I can sit around, I am lazy :p)<br /><br />Also, 3 blotters on their way to me right now :) (and mdma :D)<br /><br />3x 210mcg LSD, and 0.9g MDMA.<br /><br />Thinking of doing 100mg of mdma first, then some time later drop a 200mcg tab and wait til appropriate timing and drop 100mg. Doing this three times, then I&#039;ll save the rest mdma til next time I buy lsd, which will be within the time i&#039;m almost out. Can&#039;t trip every week sadly.
