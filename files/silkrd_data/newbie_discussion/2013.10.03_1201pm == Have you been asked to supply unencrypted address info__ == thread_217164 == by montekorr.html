				Yesterday, about 4 hours before SR was seized, I received a message from a vendor with whom I had an outstanding order in processing. It went something like this:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m really sorry for the delay in contacting you. I have your order ready for dispatch, but I can&#039;t decrypt your GPG address info as my computer got smashed and I&#039;m having to use the backup laptop, which doesn&#039;t have GPG installed. Please can you resend your address in either clear text or privnote format? Alternatively I can cancel your order for you.&quot;<br /><br />I sent my address via privnote, thinking nothing of it, and an hour or so later my order was marked as in transit. As you can imagine, I&#039;m now more than a bit concerned that the message was not sent by the vendor and that I have volunteered my address to the law. If the order fails to show then I will be pretty certain that whoever messaged me was an imposter working for LE.<br /><br />Has anyone else had anything similar happen to them?

				Honestly, it sounds like the vendor was just having trouble with pgp/gpg. A lot of people here, vendors and buyers, have various issues with pgp - maybe he said the computer thing cos he was embarrassed that he fucked up his public key somehow and now has to explain to every customer why they have to resend their address?<br /><br />By all means, be safe, but look at the case on its own merits. Was it a big order? Then obviously cops would have an interest in intercepting it/you,&nbsp; and you need to decide if you can afford to walk away. If it&#039;s less than $500, and you&#039;ve not got crates of ak-47s stacked in your living room, I reckon I would back up all my important (non-sr) documents, format, scrub with data etc, rebuild and assuming you didn&#039;t have to sign for it and it wasn&#039;t a large amount of stuff, I&#039;d accept it.<br /><br />Hell, even if you accept it and leave it on your hall table for 2 days unopened - should you get raided your hard drive is clean, the ak-47s are presumably not in the living room anymore, and you have an unopened letter - of course, you explain to Constable McOink, you obviously wouldn&#039;t open it because you have no idea what it was or where it came from.
