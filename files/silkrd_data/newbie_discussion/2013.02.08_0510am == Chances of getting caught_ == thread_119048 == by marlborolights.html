				What are the chances of getting caught when purchasing Psychedelics. It took me a while to access this site. Whenever I tried to make an account, they wouldn&#039;t be accepting registers at the time. The reason I am here is Ive wanted to try LSD. I can get pot and pills here at home no problem. Any input would be appreciated.

				Very low. And even if ur package is seized, u wont be prosecuted for personal amounts cuz they dont want to take the time to bust small deals.

				If it is LSD the probability of it getting caught is extremely small. Unlike smelly drugs like weed or cocaine, LSD really is not able to be detected by electronic sniffers. Even large quantities of LSD are relatively easy to transport since hundreds of hits can fit on a single sheet compared to shipping pounds of weed.

				Thanks for the opinions. Now its time to try and find a reliable seller, as well as figuring out GPG and stuff.

				LSD is one of the safest drugs to ship, since it can easily be disguised in a regular envelope (safer than larger packages).<br /><br />If you want to learn PGP, try the tutorial in my signature and join the Newbie PGP Club. :)

				LucyDrop is a great source for LSD, I&#039;ve also had good luck with a vendor from the UK who&#039;s name escapes me at the moment...

				Chance is very small, LSD is probably the hardest drugs to intercept for customs. But also make sure to take some other preliminary measures, like not sending it to your exact name and maybe also to another address. This way they can&#039;t even take legal action against you, if you do get caught, which is unlikely.
