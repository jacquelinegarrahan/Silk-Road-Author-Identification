				When I munch, I usually break the shrooms down a bit.&nbsp; Do the nose plug thing, stuff my face, chew a couple times and then wash it down with a can of soda.

				For proper drying of wet &#039;shrooms:<br /><br />Place &#039;shrooms in a collander. Place that on top of an open tub of dessicant (like Damp Rid). Get a small fan to blow across the collander. Takes 24-48 hrs, &#039;shrooms are properly dried when they snap like a cracker when you try to bend them.<br /><br />Another method is to get a few cellulose furnace filters, stack the sqaure filters with the &#039;shrooms sandwiched inbetween them, and strap the filters to the output-side of a cheap floor fan/box fan (bungee cords are good).<br />You shouldn&#039;t try to go more than 3-4 filters deep, and again the &#039;shrooms are only dry when they snap like a cracker!

				Another vote for Powdered and Encapsulated... we&#039;re winning!<br /><br />Using heated methods on &#039;shrooms tend to destroy some of the psylicybin (sic?), but there&#039;s still usually pleny left to do the job... especially if not exposed to scorching, dry heat for prolonged lengths of time (like on a pizza). I still hate the taste of the tea. I like most other teas, though!

				Just munch them down.&nbsp; Yes, they are gross but when you make tea or some other concotion, you risk lowering the bioavailbility of the substance.<br /><br />I highly suggest using Snicker&#039;s bars.&nbsp; Take the shrooms, start chewing, then a bite of the shrooms.&nbsp; Repeat this until done.&nbsp; Chocolate is a great at masking taste as is caramel so if you do it right, you wont get the taste of them and not lower the bioavailbility.&nbsp; Other candy bars or protein bars that are similar will work too.

				I get what you&#039;re saying, but I am in the happy position of living in a place where I can go for a walk (at the right time of year) and pick as many as I want. So losing potency is easily dealt with by adding another dozen or so into the pot!

				I make and sell capsules and I will say this, the capsules beat the hell out of my old fashioned way of eating (dried and whole). I have tried the Lemon Tek which is easy with the capsules and makes my trips just right. The LT increases my visuals but I don&#039;t have to be tripping all night for 8 hours and I can easily go to sleep after tripping through the length of a movie or two. <br />I never have tried tea but if you guys say it changes the trip I would love to try it! :o

				I&#039;ve never heard of anyone else doing this but it works great and there is no loss of bio availability( that i am aware of). What i do is take the desired dose(for me anywhere from 3.5 to 7 grams depending on potency), throw them in a blender and add frozen orange juice concentrate. CONCENTRATE. DO NOT mix up into the juice. DO NOT thaw. Only enough concentrate to keep the solution from becoming gritty. I dont know if the acidity of the OJ releases psilocybin from the plant matter or what but my third eye starts to open inside of 15 minutes every time. Im talking a significantly quicker onset than tea or straight ingestion. Also, because of you are using FROZEN concentrate it makes a great slushie, barley taste the shrooms. You can also add fresh fruit and a little bit of milk to completely eliminate the shroomy taste but personally I kind of like it. Good luck, enjoy, and happy trails.

Its supposed to work better if you let the shrooms sit in the drink for about 20 minutes. I searched around on the clearnet for why the onset is quicker and came up with this: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it&#039;s called acid-catalyzed dephosphorylation. in the gut, enzymes as well as stomach acid achieve this..<br />but by first converting all the psilocybin to psilocin, you bypass this, and psilocin is readily absorbed into the bloodstream. it passes the blood-brain barrier, and binds the raphe nuclei&#039;s 5HT receptors.<br /><br />in short, you&#039;d probably notice effects about 15-20 minutes earlier.<br />all psilocin is a cleaner feeling, more visual experience</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree that its cleaner and more visual, and barely any nausea. Unfortunately it will also shorten your trip by about an hour or so compared to just eating them. You&#039;re giving up duration for a stronger trip.

				Oh nice, I knew that shrooms contained psilocybin and psilocin. But that it was actually only psilocin, a compound created by a reaction in the stomach with the psilcybin from the mushrooms, that could pass into the brain from the bloodstream. Also I had assumed that the acidity of the OJ perpetuated part of that process before consumption. Wow, first time I&#039;ve felt smart since highschool, hahaha. I agree noumen0n, it is my favorite, and best IMHO, way to take shrooms and havent looked back since thinking of it one night after harvesting in the fields.

				A friend that got me into them taught me the best way ever. You just shred them up into tiny slivers (we cut them up with plain scissors) &amp; stir them into applesauce. No heat to degrade the potency &amp; absolutely cannot taste them. Looks terrible, but tastes like pure applesauce unless you&#039;re putting a ton in there I assume. We each had around 3g.

But I found the effects from fresh ones come more slowly (45-60 minutes?) and the trip overall is longer and softer.<br />When dried the taste is still ok, and trip starts sooner.<br /><br />I would drink a herbal tea afterwards, for faster digestion and perhaps supporting a direction of the trip, too.<br /><br />I got taught at first to take them with a cup of hot chocolate but i believe this is not needed, and it gives extra load to the stomach.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to grow my first cyans this year, the smell of the mycelium seems enjoyable, and i believe i might even enjoy the bitterness of those shrooms. Capsules - only if it&#039;s necessary to hide.

				Hi all,<br /><br />I eat my shrooms orally :)<br /><br />Seriously though, I need to cover that disgusting taste with something else. I tend to avoid them, as they&#039;re so disgusting to me. I puked a couple of times eating them. Than the high kicks in, which very unpleasant (for me) until it peaks. Than I&#039;m tripping and feel great. Except when I burp and get to experience the nasty taste again.<br />I would do them a lot more if I wasn&#039;t revulsed by the disgusting taste. Truffles are better, though not much.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll try capsules, &#039;cos they&#039;re actually good fun.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				always prefered them ground in a coffee grinder and put into gelcaps, because when i started eating shrooms you really couldn&#039;t find homegrown or whatever you want to call em.

				Like I&#039;ve said before I love capsules but I thought I would chime in again and say that I am with Soliduslake and noumenon with the Lemon tek. It really enhances the visuals like soliduslake said and as for the shortened trip... I actually prefer that. I once had a great trip ended horribly because I was stupid and took them the night before I had to work the next afternoon and was trying to get to bed and could not sleep and shit you not I believe I had time stand still and possibly traveled back in time a few minutes! Ha. Anyways, love the visuals with Lemon Tek and love the ability to go to bed after a few trippy movies or whatever.&nbsp; :o

				Always used to just munch them down, I didnt really mind the taste that much and as long as had a drink by me could get them down very smoothly. One of my friends (who is a fussy eater anyway) used to order a double cheeseburger and stuff the mushrooms between the two burgers and munch it down as quick as he could.

				@ Jason Bourne,<br />Here is an easy guide to the Lemon Tek:&nbsp; :)<br />&quot;1) Pull apart mushroom capsules.<br /><br />2) Dump the powdered shrooms in a glass.<br /><br />3) Cut up 2-3 limes/lemons, squeeze the juice (i just use my hand) into the glass of shrooms. Your goal in this step is to fully submerge the shrooms with lemon juice, so if you need more than 3 limes/lemons, go for it. I recommend cutting the limes/lemons into 4 pieces each, makes it easier to squeeze. Remember, if it a bit of shrooms is sticking out of the juice/isn&#039;t fully submerged, you need more juice.<br /><br />4) Let this concoction sit in the glass for 20 minutes, stir every 5-10 minutes with a spoon.<br /><br />5) Once 20 min is up, drink that stuff down. Your goal here is to drink it as fast as you can without keeping it in your mouth any longer than you have to.<br /><br />6) Trip balls&quot;

				We chuck the desired amount of chopped shrooms into a cup, add a teaspoon of lemon, some honey to taste and then allow to steep for a few minutes. <br /><br />Then both drink AND eat the shrooms. We used to just drink, but we found eating them in addition seemed to prolong each trip by a couple of hours. That might have been psychosomatic, but I can test this hypothesis soon.... :D<br />
