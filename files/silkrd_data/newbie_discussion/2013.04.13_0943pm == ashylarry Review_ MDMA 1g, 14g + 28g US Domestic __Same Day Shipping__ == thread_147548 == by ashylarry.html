				I&#039;m kind of surprised there aren&#039;t any reviews on this side yet, so here goes...<br /><br />TL;DR: 5/5.<br /><br />Ordered 1 g MDMA on a Saturday. No particular rush on my part, but communication with ashylarry was great; he sent a message within the hour letting me know my order would ship Monday. It arrived Thursday, so three days in transit domestically. Not bad at all. Stealth was very good. My only minor quibble here is that inside the also-excellent protective packaging, the MDMA was in aluminum foil, which split open and spilled some product inside the second layer of shipping material. Not a problem, but some desperate junkie ripping the package open could lose some.<br /><br />Appearance, smell, taste, all as expected. Uniform light tan chunks and crystals, no powder. There were a handful of darker black flecks that I discarded. Even after all that the sample weighed in at 998 mg according to my cheapo Chinese scale. After pulverizing it, an anhydrous acetone wash yielded 821 mg of very good-looking greyish-white crystals; again, about what I&#039;d expect. I certainly didn&#039;t feel the need for a second wash like I would with &quot;dirty&quot; samples. Marquis&#039; reagent showed a rapid (~7 sec) progression to jet black.<br /><br />One hour before dosing, I had a light snack, 1000 mg vitamin C, and 400 mg magnesium. Dosed in a gel cap to make sure I was where I needed to be before it hit me. 80 mg (1.1 mg/kg) seemed about right to start - it&#039;s been a year, so I should have no tolerance. From there, all times are approximate; I scribbled a couple notes, but I was having too much fun to play scientist all night.<br /><br />1:30 - Can definitely tell that I&#039;m coming into something other than a placebo effect.<br />1:50 - What the hell just happened? One minute I&#039;m more or less sober, the next I feel AMAZING.<br />2:10 - I never want this feeling to go away. Re-dose with another 40 mg gel cap. I&#039;m no longer worried about nausea, so I have an IPA. It&#039;s the best thing I&#039;ve ever tasted.<br />4:30 - Starting to come down just a bit. We&#039;ve been at a party for hours. I&#039;m dancing, chatting with strangers, generally having a great time. Palms are sweaty and I&#039;m chewing gum like it&#039;s my job. I go to the bathroom and my pupils are the size of dimes. So much for subtlety; everyone I&#039;ve talked to knows what&#039;s up.<br />5:00 - Sobering up to the point that I can walk home. Rustle of leaves, cool night air on my skin... awesome.<br />6:00 - Having a fantastic time playing with my cat. I try to stay up until the entire roll is done, but I can&#039;t keep my eyes open.<br />11:00 - Wake up, go for a run. Feeling pretty good, but tired. The only thing that can&#039;t be attributed to partying all night is a little tightness in my jaw. No hangover.<br /><br />This seems to be a high-quality, relatively pure product. No symptoms of other amphetamines, which is always my biggest worry. It&#039;s going to be hard waiting 30 days. I would without hesitation order from ashylarry again.
