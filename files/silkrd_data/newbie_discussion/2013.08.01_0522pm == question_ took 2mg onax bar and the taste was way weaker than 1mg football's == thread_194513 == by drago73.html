				I could definitely taste the alprazolam in them, it&#039;s just that it was at best half as strong and bitter as 2 footballs. They&#039;re onax, so i know they&#039;re from india and generic. I also ordered oxycontin. I should have waited to see how strong the onax bar was before taking the oxycontin. I have a low opiate tolerance and i can definitely feel the oxycontin already. It&#039;s just hard to gauge if there are 2mgs of alprazolam in the onax bars because the oxycontin is dwarfing them.<br /><br />Yeah, i know i could look all this up on the internet, but i&#039;d much rather receive personal feedback from personal experience here on the forums. Thanks

				The idea that you can taste the potency seems a little ridiculous to me. How do you know that what you taste is the alprazolam and not some additive or binding agent? If you want to know how strong it is, the only way is to evaluate your experience while you are on it. Even then, your experience may be conditioned by your expectations.

But it wasn&#039;t nearly as strong as other 2mg bars are. he strongest taste wasn&#039;t the alprazolam. It was &quot;chalky&quot; the strongest taste was. Also xanax is supposed to dissolve and breakdown pretty quickly when placed under the tongue. Was that clearer. Thanks for responding BTW.

				What dissolves in a xanax pill is not the alprazolam itself, but the binding agent which constitutes 99% of the pill. Since you mention that this pill did not dissolve, you know at least that is different. If the pill is pressed tighter and in a different binding agent, then comparing alprazolam taste is an invalid measure of potency since only the surface is accessible to taste.

I did not know that. I&#039;m gonna test it&#039;s potency tomorrow morning by itself. Thanks again.<br /><br />+1 karma

When they came i noticed that they didn&#039;t have any marks on them, so i messaged vendor and she said that they were made in europe somewhere. So fucking potent. <br /><br />Anyway i just ate 2 bars, and it&#039;s only been fifteen minutes, so if they really have 2 mg&#039;s then I should feel it.
