				I do not need advice on the matter, just throwing it out there to see what the Australian public think about the topic.<br />Any examples from the history of Australian law could be interesting as well...<br /><br />If you come up with a business model which is within the law, but advertise your wares on Silk Road, does this cross a line and result in you breaking the law?<br /><br />Examples of possible &quot;LEGAL&quot; Silk Road Vendor businesses could include:<br />+ Baggie supplier<br />+ Empty capsule supplier<br />+ Chemical tester / Pill tester kit seller<br />+ Bitcoin trader<br />+ T-shirts and Caps seller<br />+ Legal drug paraphernalia<br /><br />While these are all legal items, do you fellow Australians think advertising them on SR means you are breaking the law?<br /><br />I look forward to hearing your thoughts...<br /><br />NEWorOLD

				As long as you keep meticoulous records for every sale and purchase to complete your tax, gst etc there is no law about what platform you may or may not use to reach your target demagraphic <br />(in my opinion)

				&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t even need to keep records for tax if it was just a small hobby business. Search for ebay &amp; ato. Silkroad is not an illegal site according to Australian law, AB.

				Real interesting topic to bring up.. Definitely pros and cons.<br /><br />I personally dont think it would be illegal selling legal products on SR but (these always a but) I can see the point you make when you ask about the different products. First thing you would have to ask is would you really be making that much money that you would want to claim your payments and make it accountable for tax purposes? In my opinion i would not bother. If your online SR legal business was your only income i would look into maybe getting a ABN and pay tax but the the only reason i see to do that is for a income paper trail if i had thoughts in the future to get a bank loan. You would also have to look at the point where if your running your business through the TOR Browser and using bit coin how can any information/business be traced back to you. <br /><br />Another point to make is in some states like SA drug paraphernalia can be determined illegal by the arresting officer. <br />

				Yeah very interesting.. I&#039;m pretty sure your ok selling non prohibited items/substances... my understanding is that<br />its not against to join, buy or sell on SR. I cant really remember how I found this info but I researched a bit before joining up.<br />I actually thought I&#039;d noticed a few Vendors selling all &#039;legal&#039; products pop up just recently.. I could be wrong though.<br /><br /><br />

				Here is what i think about whats legal and whats illegal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You make up your own mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;I had a legit business for 30 + years and at any one time employed a min of 8 people. I worked my guts out 7 days a week 50 weeks a year and for what.&nbsp; The fucking piece of shit Government (puppets to the corporation) just took more and more and more.&nbsp; Every single time you were starting to get ahead the fucking tax man would take it off you in some new bullshit lying tax. A good one was the GST . I had to put another full time person on just to do the fucking tax mans job for him and did i get anything back NO way the c@#ts just kept taking more and more until nothing is left.&nbsp; &nbsp;It all became to much so one day i thought fuck it&nbsp; shut the doors and walked away.&nbsp; At that time i employed 32 workers who now didnt have a job but you know what it was the BEST THING I EVER DID.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now i play there game.&nbsp; I now live to do what the fucks had done to me for so long.&nbsp; &nbsp; I woke up to what the fucking scum are doing to us and now for as long as i live i will be doing anything and everything to get back what the government and corporation have stolen from me.&nbsp; Because that is exactly what they are doing to every single one of us.<br /><br />&nbsp;So in conclusion i say this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything they tell you is the is in fact the opposite.&nbsp; &nbsp;If its legal it will be bad for and kill you or a lie or both.&nbsp; &nbsp;If its illegal it will be good for you and the truth.&nbsp; &nbsp; Its time the people of this planet stand up and take back what was and is ours in to begin with.&nbsp; If we dont there will be nothing left.<br /><br />EVERYTHING YOU WERE TAUGHT AT SCHOOL, TOLD AND THINK YOU KNOW IS A LIE. <br /><br />Anyway thats just what i think you believe what you want.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have a great day :)

				Thanks for all your replies guys.&nbsp; I enjoyed reading through your responses.<br />Now we get a little deeper...<br /><br />The business model I have come up with is actually an American Bitcoin Exchange.<br />I want to make it simple and quick for vendors to exchange their Bitcoin back into cash, and easy for buyers to purchase their coin.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t started yet, but am very excited with the near future.<br /><br />With this idea, I am thinking big, so it rules out the chance of it being just a hobby (with tiny income).<br />I want to register a legitimate company to do this as well for a source of legal income.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find any information online which says that it is illegal to set up a store on SR, and I feel that as long as I keep clean records and pay my taxes, all should be good.<br /><br />Do you guys think that me advertising a Bitcoin Exchange on Silk Road could get me in trouble for money laundering?&nbsp; <br />From my research, money laundering is converting illegal funds into seemingly legitimate funds.<br />My exchange would just be trading dirty Bitcoin, for dirty cash so no laundering whatsoever ... right?<br /><br />If vendors used a separate SR account to cash out their Bitcoin, I feel that I would have plausible deniability from knowing where the coin came from ... right?&nbsp; Or is being on SR too close?<br /><br />Once again, I am just after the public&#039;s thoughts on the matter.&nbsp; I will need to seek my own legal advice as well but just want to see what you all think.<br /><br />NEWorOLD
