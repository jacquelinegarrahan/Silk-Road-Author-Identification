				You&#039;d probably only be able to do it for 3 months of the year at very best. Weather is too crap in this country for guerrilla grows. Check out UK 420 forum that&#039;s where I learnt most of my growing skills.

				Thanks for the replys.<br />Polytunnel would be out of the question as there are too many choppers about.<br />Is it possible to grow indoors without giving out heat.<br />I&#039;m thinking about doing some hydrobuds on the 1st floor of a 3story building.<br />I&#039;m thinking that it would just be a matter of insulating around the windows but am not sure.<br /><br />Also what would I get for being caught with say 4 plants without any previous convictions?

				Id be thinking a greenhouse would be the least you will need if you have access or space for one. If not then you need to select a fast growing, early flowering and early harvesting breed which is suitable to grow outdoors. Once you have the right seed then you need the right spot which is going to ofcourse be private and secure otherwise you are wasting your time. But you want a spot with maximum sunshine through most the day yet still has cover for camoflauge so people can not see it from a distance and to protect the plants from wind and storms. The extra cover also holds thermal insulation so your plants will not freeze and die the first night it gets cold (like a greenhouse). So choosing the right spot that meets all your needs is not going to be straight up easy unless you already have a spot sorted out. <br />Now with the growing site selected you are best to prepare that site for best growth. Some physical labor will be involved. Soil, drainage, and you may even need some barrier to keep wild animals out from eating your plants. This will be the hard work.<br />To give your plants a head start you should germinate your seeds indoors a month or so before the last frost of winter or spring. Grow them by a window or a under a light if you have one. This means getting the most grow time before the first frost of next autumn or winter. <br />You probably want to plant a few seeds and kill off the weak ones that struggle. You will have some males too that will need to die once they reach flowering. So Id plant around 20 and hope to harvest maybe 5? Its all a guess but too many is better than ending up with one healthy plant after all your work and it flowers male..<br />With all of this preparation all you can do is hope for the best. Find out if anyone else has tried this in your region. If so then its possible. If not then you can still try. <br />Personally I live in a climate where you can grown weed almost all year round. Indoors is so much easier and so much better harvest and product. The market wants hydro too. Outdoor bud is usually very stemmy and leafy and taste worse. They take longer to grow outdoors and someone can steal it the night before you go out to cut them down. Indoors is way better.<br />Good luck.

				warning clearnet link: forum.grasscity.com<br />Their forum has a lot of home growers. In general you can get away with about 3-4 plants per 150w hps. That&#039;ll give you a few ounces with a 16-8 cycle then 12-12 cycle. I personally did a grow back when I was at University and I was limited with space so I had 2 60w cfl&#039;s and I had one plant, I did a 20-4 veg cycle and then 12-12 flowering and I also tied down the branches to force it to grow out rather than up since space was limited. For the smell I used Ozium air sanitizer, which you can get on amazon, it does wonders! I ended up getting a whole 2 ounces from one little plant :) I highly recommend the 20-4 light cycle but do your research every grow is an experiment you never really know how its gonna come out. Best of luck
