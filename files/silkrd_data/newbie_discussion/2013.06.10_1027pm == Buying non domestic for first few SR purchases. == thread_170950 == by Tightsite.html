				Hi,<br /><br />I was advised that it would be best to only buy domestic for my first 5 or so purchases.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how important this is though?<br /><br />There is a seller I have already seen and tested their goods, has great feedback and I know someone who buys regularly from them so I&#039;m happy to make a purchase from them.&nbsp; Only problem is they&#039;re not domestic (ship from Europe) so I just want to please ask any advice on this subject before I do business.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />TS

				It doesn&#039;t really matter, there&#039;s just more risks of seizure but unless you&#039;re buying ounces at a time you&#039;ll just get a love letter in the worst case. My first order was international and nothing happened... Most drugs are shipped in letters and customs don&#039;t really inspect letters anyways. I wouldn&#039;t buy weed from overseas though.

				shipping from EU to EU? as long as it&#039;s in the schengen zone there should be no problem.<br /><br />if it&#039;s overseas i wouldn&#039;t do it as a first try.

				Cheers for the feed back.<br /><br />Anyone know what the ETA for post from Hungary to the UK is roughly?&nbsp; <br /><br />Want it for before next Wednesday but might be cutting it a bit fine.&nbsp; ::)

				My first few purchases were for ecstasy pills from NL to the US. First one went fine (and quick) then two other orders didn&#039;t arrive. Then a couple of other orders came through no problem.<br /><br /><br />As others have said, there&#039;s more risk of seizure across international orders more so from some places to some places...eg. NL to US. You should be fine within the EU and not even NL.<br /><br />Of the several US to US orders I&#039;ve placed since, all shipments have been trouble free and quick.<br /><br />
