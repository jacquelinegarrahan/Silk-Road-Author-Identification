People sit/sat in prison for crimes that aren&#039;t a crime at all now. In certain states the state itself has legalized the production and distribution of marijuana and I soon see that going into a federal policy. At one point drinking alcohol or being in possession of it, deemed you a criminal. The USA was founded on foreign people coming onto a foreign land and killing the inhabitants off to near extinction, the only crime that was seen in that is tax evasion of the King, not the fact that people were slaughtered. Define yourself and say fuck the rest. I do not feel above the law, but I do feel that as long as I am not hurting others and stealing from others, I am not a criminal. Nice thread, +1 to the creator.
