				i&#039;ve done small doses of acid in the past.<br />recently did ~240 ug of Hoffman blotter (apparently sourced from Europe).<br />came up giggly and smiling, but body tension was building. When I peaked like 2-3 hrs later, the visuals were awesome, but I was SO tense. i felt like my leg was spasming at times (and overall body too). I wanted to lay down and enjoy the visuals, but seriously could not relax. Is high body tension a result of LSD itself? I took valium at that point, which didn&#039;t seem to help.<br />At the end, my lip even got swollen! (allergic reaction). So i dunno if this is actual LSD?&nbsp; could be DOx.&nbsp; anyone have this sort of experience?<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in purchasing more cause i did enjoy it overall, but I wanna make sure im getting actual LSD. I don&#039;t know the terms though! what should I be looking for?<br />What is WoW, fluff, white, etc.<br />also, what vendors do YOU have experience with, that had the good stuff.<br /><br />also interested in shrooms, mescaline, and dmt, but I wanna get comfortable with acid before moving on.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Intense body highs can def occur with lsd, and can be exacerbated by pre-drop emotions, like maybe some, totally understandable, anxiety at taking a large dose. Not sure about the lip reaction, again maybe lsd intensified physical reaction to latent anxiety. You should check this vendor&#039;s lsd review thread and see if The Avengers have anything written about it. You can send me a pm with his username, AB.

				<br />i was quite calm/normal beforehand. I thought both my Set and Setting were good. i could have been hiding some anger/anxiety that I failed to address though. will look into reviews. and will try to figure out what the heck all this terminology is too

				Many people within the LSD community understand that different batches of LSD can have different loads on the body and mind. When reviewing people may say &quot;Awesome visuals and really small body load&quot; what there basically saying is the Lucy they had didn&#039;t have much of a physical effect on there body like you did when you dropped. People ten not to like large loads on their body for obvious reasons, it stops them doing things they want when tripping. You may find when you next drop with different stuff the body load maybe different, but keep trying different stuff until you find a batch you really like.<br />In terms of your other questions well &quot;WoW&quot; stands for White on White, this is usually when high quality white crystal LSD is laid onto white blotter. It&#039;s mostly a sign of some good stuff among the acid community when people sell &quot;WoW&quot;but of course looks can be deceiving so be cautious.<br />White Fluff is a name given to a certain potency of Acid, below is the potency and corresponding name among the community given to that range.<br /><br />Needlepoint -very pure(95%) white powdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. The best of the best<br /><br />White Fluff -Very pure(95%) white light flakes of crystal. Still around and the most sought after. very pure<br /><br />Silver -Good and clean(85-90%)-light greyish crystal. Was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. Very good stuff.<br /><br />Amber -Decent(70%?) This crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.Was always available.One batch called quadriceps amber was the color of light honey and was very good.Lot`s a people worked with this crystal but I always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price.<br /><br />Lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. Like amber it varied batch to batch.<br /><br />Champagne -(50-60%) Lowest quality crystal you could get.<br /><br />Hope this has been some help to you, happy tripping and welcome to the Road.<br /><br />PlanB 8)
