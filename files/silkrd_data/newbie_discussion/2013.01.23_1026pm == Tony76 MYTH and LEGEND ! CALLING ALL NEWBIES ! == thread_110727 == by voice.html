				Every roader should know the tale of most infamous scam/mystery/heist/unsolved case that took place on April 2012.<br />The lessons of never FE&#039;ing is well understood and past down to future generations, <br />but we should never forget for that was truly something for the Silk Road history book.<br />Extremely short version : (way too wasted ATM to write a full report that will give it justice) <br />On 4/20/2012, #1 Vendor at the time called for a MASSIVE sellout involving estimated $500K (!!!) only to vanish into the darknet.<br />For those of you who got mystified I recommend digging the forums for more info..<br /><br />P.S: I do not, by any means, wish to encourage &quot;scamming&quot; behavior or any thing of the sort.<br />&nbsp;Cheers

				i&#039;ve been here since the early days, and tony was the man untill he decided to fuck everyone over. Ive met people in my life who have ripped people out of £££££££&#039;s and even though that money in anothers hand would have done alot, for these people it never stays and they end up like the community tramps who then tell stories of the glory days which then no-1 beleives. lol.<br />But that doesnt suggest that all SR vendors are corrupt. Ive FE&#039;d with supertrips and dispater and had problems and both times i got refunded. <br />I think SR is much better now though than it was in the early days.

				For what it&#039;s worth, BTC was trading for $5 back in April &#039;12. It is now trading at above $16 ($30,000 for ol&#039; Tony76) and was recently damn near $20 ($400,000 for ol&#039; Tony76) So unless he laundered it all already, Tony76 did quite well for himself.

				It was traced that he made off with about 30000BTC I think it was through blockchain.<br /><br />So what he left with has inflated over time, but at the time it was around 150k from SR alone<br /><br />He also setup an offshoot &quot;VIP&quot; website that had a couple thousand BTC

				Not that I know anything about this sort of stuff, me being a newbie and all, but are dealers selling stuff like blow and heroin more likely to be pulling scams than guys selling weed or LSD? Seems like there might be a difference between the opiate/stimulant type of crowd vs the psychedelic/weed toking crowd, or am I just perpetuating unfounded stereotypes?

				Maybe a NL mdma guy, tough to say. Tony didnt get really going until he brought in high ticket items like sheets of acid and ounces of MDMA .. which looking back was way out of character. But hindsight is 20/20<br /><br />I am not sure it can be done again. I think alot more people are alot more educated about FE&#039;ing. The forums are more popular, so these things cant get out of control like they maybe did with Tony.

				Yes, ONLY $100,000.&nbsp; That&#039;s 20% of what he claimed. No, it wasn&#039;t solely from SR, It was also from T-Mart which wasn&#039;t VIP, just for anyone who had ordered through him.&nbsp; The $100,000 figure is the combination of the two. <br /><br />No, He got big right away, it&#039;s the addition of the MDMA(which wasn&#039;t the greatest, for the record) and his Heroin pebbles(which got great reviews) that made more customer&#039;s and let more people know how big he was.&nbsp; He was in #1 in 2 or 3 weeks shipping out dozens of orders per day.&nbsp; EVERY ORDER FE.&nbsp; After 3 months of getting everyone used to FE he started scamming.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about having a higher likely hood of scamming, but vendors selling coke and heroin tend to have lower ratings due to their customer base.

				Well, He became so trusted because he regularly shipped out large quantities of very high quality drugs that arrived in the US in days and anywhere in the world in &lt; 2 weeks.&nbsp; He came through with large amounts of money without a single hitch after having the buyer FE that nobody questioned him.

				catfish: We&#039;re on the SR FORUMS talking about the SR, not other &#039;sights&#039;.<br /><br />Oliveoil:&nbsp; That&#039;s been suggested several times about vendors that were here before he left or made an account shortly after the scam.&nbsp; The accusations mostly started fizzling out.<br /><br />bankofgt: I would even disagree with that.&nbsp; What happens if it doesn&#039;t come in the allotted time?&nbsp; PM the vendor. if he says it shipped(or even reshipped) you have to wait to see if it&#039;ll show up.&nbsp; Then you have that drop tied up and you won&#039;t know if it was intercepted(if it was even sent) for a while so that drop address will be bad for future purchases or at least tied up for a time.&nbsp; Also, You&#039;re encouraging bad behavior even if only for newbies and even if unintentional.

				* clears throat* IAM TONY 76 and I have been back for months. No really though surely DPR has some measures in place to stop the fraudsters from high tailing it out of&nbsp; here with their ill gotten gains. Why would a trusted vendor want to cash out so quick? surely the Mods can see how many orders have been placed ,and have they been shipped? before the Tony76 character cashed out? I can understand running of with cash, but BTC surely you can&#039;t hastily cash out?? Maybe I&#039;m living in the perfect world but DPR must be capable of id ing the wronguns!

				weirdal<br /><br />my country of residence is australia i have made two small FE purchases had a win with both no tracking.<br />in the matter of two months devoted countless hours to picking potential vendors<br />If I put in an international order and it did not arrive i would put in one more order from a smooth as silk vendor such as the good doctor if that did not arrive i would probably say with strong conviction my left nostril is burnt <br /><br />The catch is with the highest ranked pushers they all been labelled&nbsp; as selective scammers... at some point. Personally I would never use any of the top 1% vendors. <br /><br />Indiana Jones&nbsp; whom i first dealt with&nbsp; informed me finalizing early is 100% the fastest way to get bent on the road.<br /><br />Sad But True<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Like many apocryphal stories, tony didn&#039;t disappear into thin air. Neither is he living a life of luxury on the back of his ill gotten gains. No he is back trading here under a psuedenom, Do you&nbsp; really think he is going to walk away after a score like that? These people can&#039;t walk away, he is back now, playing the long game and grooming his hapless future victims. I would only buy of a vendor who has been trading as long as Tony myself. That way, you know 100% it&#039;s not bony tony! Peace pout and be safe, SODB

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages. I pointed out that their Site was the same as &#039;Executive Outcomes&#039; (EO) and they posted a disclaimer that they had nothing to do with them immediately.<br />&nbsp;<br />They said a tracking number would be provided in 7-12 days- so they have around a week and half to prove this. But I am not hopeful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also wrote to Executive Outcomes- and only got this in reply- &quot;Thanks another scam&quot;. They are identical to AD, just look jazzier.<br />&nbsp;<br />For example, just look at the spelling mistake on both sites: http://imwvq3drst5zens6.onion/index.php ... er=product on EO and on http://2ousn6z3qfxvcv7t.onion/ArmsDepot ... oductID=84 on AD. It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites??? Smells very fishy to me.<br />Luckily I placed a very small order on AD I could afford to lose. Losing money is losing money- but the lesson is worth it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bests<br />Shenobie
