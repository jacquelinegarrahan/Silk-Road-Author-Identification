				I just noticed something... <br /><br />For about 5 minutes I couldn&#039;t get into the forums. I was like oh shit... now they are hitting the forums again. However, during that 5 minutes I was able to log into SR, check my order status, withdraw BTC, and got back to the orders page. As I was submitting my feedback... SR timed-out again, but the forums started working again.<br /><br />Did this happen to anyone else or was it just a fluke(y) coincidence?

				there is things we plebs can do that would help. a rapid expansion of the tor network capacity would raise the cost of the attack significantly and increase the chance that people can get in and get business done. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0<br /><br />that&#039;s my thread discussing the options i see. i am not new to the cypherpunk community. i just have never been that active because math is not my strong point. but i am good at seeing patterns and trends.<br /><br />the more people who stump up some bandwidth to help increase tor capacity the more expensive the attack becomes, because the channel is wider and more legitimate users of sr will get through.<br /><br />another thing that i have been thinknig might help is people raising the &#039;http keep-alive&#039; time in their browsers. with a bigger number on that setting, a connection to SR will be locked away from the attacker, and available to you. the way &#039;keep-alive&#039; works is the browser reuses connections to query the web server, if you set a longer time between making new connections, this also stops other users getting at the site. in this case, if you are a legitimate user of the site, then it might mean you can access the site for a lot longer. <br /><br />it&#039;s not a long term solution, neither running tor non-exit relays nor the increasing of http keep-alive. but they will both raise the cost of the attack. and there is hundreds of us here. think about it. we could actually all help make sure that this attacker&#039;s yield is lowered. even if you personally can only lower their advantage by 0.1%, isn&#039;t that still worth it?

				Ok... so I have done what I needed to do today on SR. Just hope my vendor sees my new order asap. Since nothing can be done this late in the weekend... I gonna leave her alone for a day and carry on and do some yard work (while high as fuck) and hopefully someone has killed the attacker by Monday morning.<br /><br />Later guys.

				DPR and her/his crew are very competent, there is no doubt about this, they have been in this business for going on 2 years now. but don&#039;t discount what you can do as an individual. since &#039;spam&#039; is not unsociable in this segment of the forum, read my post: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 i am trying to get people to do things that can have possibly measurable and significant effects on the attackers who are harming all of our interests. to sum it up, running non-exit tor relays and increasing your &#039;http keep-alive&#039; are the two techniques i&#039;m proposing. the first widens the channel that the DDoSers have to fill, and the second clogs the channel with persistent connections that you are doing legit business with.<br /><br />i personally have not been able to get onto SR all day. i&#039;m a vendor. so at this point it&#039;s just a matter of probabilities. that&#039;s why i am promoting the ideas i elaborate in that link, because they tilt the table in our favour.

				The answer to this problem will lie somewhere along the lines of a distributed architecture. I don&#039;t know if SR will have to share the load with other, similar sites, whether the Tor protocol will need to be redesigned (China still does wholesale Tor blocking), or some sort of proof-of-work system will need to be devised in order to use the system. Either way, I think a solution will be found. I just don&#039;t know the when, or the what. Yet ;)
