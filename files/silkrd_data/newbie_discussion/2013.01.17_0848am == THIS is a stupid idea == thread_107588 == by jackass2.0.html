				I appreciate your hard work in keeping the forums clear of spam but this new post count rule, still,&nbsp; does not prevent them from spamming in the first place. <br /><br />What it is currently doing is preventing new members and quite a few longer-term members with average-daily post counts from sharing their feedback and views with the rest of the community. <br /><br />50 posts is alot of junk, i have been a member for almost 3 months and spent c300btc on your site. Yet before I discovered your new rules, only had 34 posts here, mainly feedback on my purchases which I hope was useful to other members. <br /><br />This is a backward step in your whole ethos. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well, this barrier does kinda make sense, but what if a spammer bot just publishes 50 threads with random text here? He can go to the &quot;verified&quot; part of the forum within minutes.<br /><br />Though on the other hand, I suppose you can make a sort of a filter here for those guys, so they never make it to the real section...

I do no even know if this change was in direct response to the spam issue, as I said it would be great if people new to the forums invested some time doing some reading before creating new threads etc and using the search function to do some research and I guess I&#039;m hoping this change will encourage people to do that, only time will tell.<br /><br />anyway...

				I get that this new subforum is used to counteract the spam, which it will do in part as the spammers will have to accumulate 50 posts here before moving onto the rest of the forum, but I do think there should be some kind of time-limit lock on the account too before they can start posting in the rest of the forum. I&#039;ve only been a member for 2 weeks and made ~15 posts, but I&#039;ve tried to make all of my contributions to threads worthwhile and now I just have to post senselessly to join in with the rest of the community :/<br /><br />I noticed someone posted on the &quot;Finally a newbie board&quot; thread about having a $1 donation to allow posting rights in the forum. This is a good idea, a lot of people would pay it, but then wouldn&#039;t the spammers also pay this? A dollar compared to the amount they can make from just scamming one person would put them back into profit.<br /><br />CAPTCHA is always a good means to counteract spam, but the spambot&#039;s OCR seems to be able to read yours fine. Maybe it&#039;s worth trying a question/answer method? I.e. &quot;5 + 2 = ?&quot; and &quot;Who is the President of the United States?&quot;.

				Yea I hate to admit it but it does seem seem to be working. I havent seen any bit coin adds in acess while. <br /><br />I honestly can&#039;t think of another way that wouldn&#039;t infringe on, our privacy.<br /><br />I might actually consider suggesting this method on someone of the other forums I am acess member. <br /><br />It is frustrating to us new people but it is also working.<br /><br />
