				Ohhhh don&#039;t be fooled. Drug detecting dogs can be trained to smell virtually anything. A dogs nose is 6000-10000 times more sensitive than yours.&nbsp; This means if you can smell a cup of coffee, the dog can detect if it has a few grains of sugar in it!<br /><br />In Australia drug dogs are trained to detect MDMA, pot, coke, E, T, K and GBL / GHB.&nbsp; A mate of mine didn&#039;t believe me and went to a dance party with a soy-sauce fishy in his underwear....&nbsp; At the entrance, the dog came up, sniffed and sat down beside him... he was taken aside, strip searched and the single fishy (about 2.2ml) was found.&nbsp; He was arrested and charged with possession. <br /><br />My rule of thumb:&nbsp; ASSUME the dog can smell it and take the necessary precautions.<br />

				Dogs are trained to smell for just about everything except for acid and probably research chemicals. I know someone who walked right past drug dogs at the entrance for bonaroo with a large portion (maybe like a quarter of a sheet of L) and the dogs didn&#039;t even look at him.<br /><br />

				Dogs have a very powerful sense of smell. Theoretically they can smell anything. It all depends which compounds the dog has been trained to flag. I have even seen cases where dogs flagged on large amounts of cash. I don&#039;t believe dogs are trained to flag on cash, but there are documented incidents of LE finding cash that they claimed was found through the use of dogs. There is no real way of knowing what each individual dog has been trained to flag on. Just assume that if a dog is present, your substance could be flagged.

				Well, they also have currency sniffing dogs which are trained specifically to detect bulk currency, whether it has drug residue or not. Just like they have cadaver sniffing dogs, which have been trained to help locate corpses. It&#039;s not about whether or not they can, but rather whether or not they have been trained to detect something. Therefore, like CRWHITLOCK said, the best policy is to assume that dogs are trained to detect whatever you&#039;re worried about them detecting.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=143439.msg982488#msg982488">Quote from: WI on April 06, 2013, 09:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi,<br /><br />check Wiki out...

				http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/features/article/humble-honey-bee-in-national-security/<br /><br />The humble bee is being put to work. But they aren’t just making honey; they are busy being trained to sniff out drugs and explosives.<br /><br />By becoming ‘sniffer bees’, the honeybee, Apis mellifera, could soon be Britain’s answer to combating national security threats and drug smuggling. Honeybees have an acute olfactory sense, which can be thought of as a very sensitive sense of smell. By training the bees to associate an odour with a reward, scientists are able to train the bees to detect almost any odour.<br /><br />Honey BeesThis technology, which has been developed by Inscentinel Ltd., a small spin-out company based at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, has a variety of potential applications, including the detection of illegal drugs and explosives in airport security and the military, as well as in medical diagnostics and food quality control.<br /><br />“Bees are at least as good as sniffer dogs but are cheaper and faster to train, and available in much larger numbers. It is dependent on the specific odour, but bees can detect some odours that are present in parts per trillion - that’s equivalent to detecting a grain of salt in an Olympic-sized swimming pool,” says Dr Nesbit, a research scientist at Inscentinel Ltd.<br /><br />Training bees<br /><br />Honeybees have the ability to learn and memorise. The bees are loaded onto individual holders where they sit comfortably whilst exposed to an odour which is passed over them in short pulses. Whilst exposed to the odour, the bees are simultaneously rewarded with a small drop of sugar syrup, which the bees stick their proboscis (tongue) out to receive. This is a classical Pavlovian conditioning method. Once conditioned, if the bees pick up the odour they’ve been trained to detect, they stick their probosces out in anticipation of the syrup, before the syrup is offered. This proboscis extension reflex is the signal that the scientists use to determine successful conditioning. It takes between two and eight rounds of training which is completed in just a few hours, with the reflex lasting for several days.<br /><br />Making the science reality<br /><br />Once trained, up to 36 bees are loaded into a handheld sensing device. The bees can be trained to detect the same odour, or smaller groups of bees can be trained to detect different odours within the same device. The bees are exposed to a constant stream of clean, filtered air until a sample of air from an area requiring testing is sucked into the machine. An optical sensor records any bees extending their proboscis, which is then interpreted by software. Based on a statistical population of bees, a simple odour present/absent response follows. The whole detection process takes around six seconds.<br /><br />What about bee welfare?<br /><br />The bees are not harmed whilst performing their sniffing duties; the health and comfort of the bees dictates the performance of the sensing device. Each bee works for a maximum of a two-day shift before it is returned, healthy and unharmed, to the hive, to enjoy the rest of its life working for its colony.<br /><br />Nesbit explained that the bees have potential uses in other fields as well as national security: “We are currently involved with a project commissioned by a fruit juice factory who wants to use the bees to detect if the oranges they buy for juicing are infested with storage pests. Alternatively, the bees can also be used in medical diagnostics” she said. Nesbit explained that as some diseases are linked to a specific odour being released in the urine, blood or breath, the bees can be used as a method of detection, producing a medical diagnosis.

				Dogs are smart and can be trained to smell anything. Don&#039;t bring drugs around drug dogs. They will smell it and alert their masters. Then you will have a problem.

				If you get the chance, watch Barry Cooper&#039;s &quot;Never Get Busted Again.&quot;<br /><br />The guy is a former interdiction officer and has an entire segment on K9&#039;s and what their limitations are. Very interesting to watch and learn how these dogs are trained. Also interesting is how he goes on to note that some handlers will often incite a K9 to false alert. By understanding how the K9&#039;s are trained you can figure out how to safeguard yourself.<br /><br />-CC

				Cool citation, smokecrack.<br /><br />I read somewhere (no link but it&#039;s probably easy to search for), that dogs have not typically been trained to sniff acid because it is problematic for their mental state. However, a company came up with a chemical that smell almost exactly the same (close enough for training), and they were making it available for police dog training. I&#039;m not sure how widespread this training chemical is, but it exists (apparently).<br /><br />Like others have said, I package everything as if it&#039;s coke.
