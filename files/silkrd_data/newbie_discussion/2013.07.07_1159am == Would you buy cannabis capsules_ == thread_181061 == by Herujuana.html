				Hello all. I make cannabis capsules for my personal use. They are made from the highest quality medicinal marijuana. I hand select everything that goes into the capsues. I make both indica and sativa capsules so I can tailor the pill to my daily needs (i.e. couch vs active and alert). The herb is first decarboxylated (THCa fully converted into psychoactive TCH) then slow processed into high bioavailable coconut oil, and from there carefully placed in capsues for consumption. These little gems provide a nice, 6-8 hour high that is not anything like smoking! Although most of the effects are quite similar to smoking, i.e. depending on the strain you will get the intended effects of that strain. Taking too much can even bring on experiences quite similar to other psychedelics! These are NOT for amateurs. The contents are similar to making budder, but my method doesn&#039;t require you to cook the resulting concoction into anything else. They are ready to take, kick ass effects, and are very discrete. I keep mine in a medicine bottle. Can be taken anywhere you go. And the only caveat is you must plan on being high for a loooong time, and need to take them at least an hour before you expect results on an empty stomach. My question: would you by these? And also, do you have any questions? Thanks.

				If they were priced well I would definately consider trying it. I get alot of enjoyment out of smoking so you might have a better market if you sell the BHO itself and the capsules for those who don&#039;t smoke

				I wouldn&#039;t mind trying it, like the previous poster said. I wouldn&#039;t be sure if I would like it or not because I have yet to try anything like that. I&#039;ve hardly had edibles and had only a couple hits of BHO. It&#039;s worth a shot.

				I think it&#039;s a good idea and it is something that could definitely take off.<br />You should go for it and gauge the demand.

				It sounds like a wonderful product. Once I get more used to the whole SR system and a little more comfortable with placing orders It would certainly be something I would look into

				Personally, as I&#039;m quite new to SR (and drugs in general, other than smoking cannabis) I just don&#039;t know what to expect and so I&#039;m hesitant to order.<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;d enjoy it, I just don&#039;t know if I want to try out this and MDMA and edibles and etc. etc. all having them ship to the same place in a short amount of time.<br /><br />In other words, I&#039;m scared of ordering things to try them out for the first time.

				I&#039;m interested in trying a sample, before I throw my hard earned btcs at you.<br /><br />Along with capsules, I&#039;m also want to try concentrates (wax, hash, oils, etc). I&#039;m suprised that I&#039;ve been on the road for awhile, and I have yet to order one of them.

				Thanks for all the feedback. I still need to perfect some things before going retail with them. But, yes, they are everything I&#039;ve said they are. I like discretion and these are about as discreet as you&#039;ll get when it comes to taking cannabis. No smell, no mess, no paraphernalia to carry around. No nosy neighbors. Just a first class stone when you need it. I&#039;ve taken these to concerts, popped one or two a couple of hours before it starts and was flying high the entire time! And, yes they&#039;re economical. Nothing gets wasted, except you of course. I&#039;ll keep everyone posted if/when I decide to put them up. I might even offer samples. Thanks again.
