				oh, you again ^^<br /><br />it&#039;s really a pitty that you only ship to UK.&nbsp; if you decide to ship to EU (or at least germany) message me. (or make an announcement here.) i wouldn&#039;t use coke with that %s personally, but if you haven&#039;t pulled the numbers out of your ass i could imagine reselling a couple of grams offline regularly.<br /><br />btw: maybe you should contact pinapplelove here at the forum and give him a sample for lab testing.i think that would sweep in some customers.<br />&nbsp;<br />have a nice day...uhm... friday night ;)<br /><br />

				Hi guys, really sorry only shipping to the UK at the moment until I have established a UK customer base then I will consider shipping internationally. I don&#039;t know what the hell infowars is playing at posting those addresses on this thread???? &gt;:( that has absolutely nothing to do with me or my customers! Anyway will keep you all updated with any changes.... And sorry there&#039;s no more free samples available at the moment as I am still awaiting feedback on the ones that I sent out but will keep everyone posted...&nbsp; ;)
