				Yeah, a few vendors have been having the same problem. I think its after SR went down to the credit system, they&#039;re still backlogging from that...

				Yeah i posted a similar thing earlier, its slow as cold molasses going uphill, and thats if it even decides to load.<br />I added a setting or two to speed up tor and I set up relaying on my computer, I haven&#039;t really noticed a significant increase in speed though.&nbsp; Silk Road just might be taking a dump over at gmail.com or something.
