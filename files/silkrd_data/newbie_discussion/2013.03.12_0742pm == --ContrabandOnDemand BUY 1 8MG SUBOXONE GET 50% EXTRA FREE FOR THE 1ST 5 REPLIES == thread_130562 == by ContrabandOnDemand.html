				Just an update on this lotto, we have been very impressed with everyones submissions so far!<br />You guys have a great sense of humor and it looks like we are going to have a kick-ass professional brand identity (or tag line/slogan) made for us for free!&nbsp; ;D<br />Every little helps guys&nbsp; :)<br />The lotto is far from won, only 4 votes so far, so everyone get your tickets in ASAP and even if you haven&#039;t bought a ticket (why not its only 0.01!! lol jk) then vote on who you think deserves to win.<br />The submissions so far have been so good it looks like we may have to offer some runner up prizes also!<br />Anyways- best of luck to everyone and thank you for keeping us amused over the last few days.<br />CoD

				&quot;Want drugs in your nation that have been banned? Have some cash to cop some Coin with the slight of hand? Look no further when you see the masses stand, and give a cheer of approval across the land for the man with the plan...ContrabandOnDemand!&quot;<br /><br />I think this is the best one yet. The others get pretty witty, but man...this one goes ham! Lol

				Not really bothered by this since the ticket was only 0.01 (cant believe sp00ny can be fucked complaining) but according to the terms when I bought my ticket - not trying to brag here - but IM THE WINNER!!!<br />And to credit CoD- I have already been contacted and provided a delivery address.<br />Will update here when/if I receive a prize.<br /><br />-Life

I&#039;m sorry you feel that way and I will happily re-fund your ticket money. I am inexperienced with the lottery so sorry if I fucked up somehow. I just ran the lottery to build some feedback. (If you check my feedback you will see i&#039;m not a scammer. I have contacted the winner and his prize will be with him shortly and for anyone else who feels cheated please do not hesitate to contact me and i will re-fund your ticket money.<br />Apologies for the mistake. And sp00ny contact me with your details and I will send you a sample of my products as a goodwill gesture to prove I am not a scammer.<br />CoD</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
