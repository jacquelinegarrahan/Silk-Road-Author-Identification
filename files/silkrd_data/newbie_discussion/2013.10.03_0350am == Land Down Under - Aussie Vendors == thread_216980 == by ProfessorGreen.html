				Only time will tell what happens to SR. <br /><br />I am slightly hopeful that there is a backup in place but it seems my hope may be misplaced at this stage.<br /><br />Any aussie vendors setting up on BMR?

				As a vendor I&#039;ve lost out big, to all my customers that got their orders in before it shut down you will still receive them as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve lost too.<br /><br />Lets hope we find somewhere bigger, better and run smarter to do what we need to do and get what we need to get.

				So many weird things about this. How the hell does DPR have flatmates anyway? Seriously, first rule of international cybercrime empire = get your own pad.<br /><br />Am certainly in favour of keeping something here alive, just learn whatever you can from this, I would suggest keeping stuff on the downlow as much as possible, use PGP and start signing the keys of your favourite repeat vendors and customers, this way the only one who&#039;s really got anything to prove are brand new vendors no one has ever dealt with.<br /><br />Any idea if backup wallets are working? And /or autofinalisation?<br /><br />Peace<br />B D A<br />

				Where did it mention DPR having flatmates? Kinda angers me how it was run, should&#039;ve worked like this:<br /><br />DPR = Actually a team running SR (or a team running SR in general)<br />SR = Attacked directly, goes down, is seized or whatever, ok so what?<br />RENEW = Everything should&#039;ve been backed up somewhere secure so in this event we had a new &quot;SR&quot; to go to with everything intact<br /><br />Even if it were were 24 hours we would&#039;ve all been able to retrieve our BTC&#039;s and orders etc. They obviously weren&#039;t as prepared as we thought unfortunately, keen to see where us Aussies flock to now as it seems like USA and European users don&#039;t have too much to worry about being as most vendors are from there.

				In the warrant it said they became aware of his address cos a random mail search (yeah right) at Canadian border turned up several fake IDs with the same photograph addressed to what turned out to be his place which he rented with two other people who apparently knew him as &#039;Josh&#039; and said he stayed in his room a lot... yeah seriously.

				I&#039;m still baffled on the fact that SR boiled down to a single person at the end of the day - a team would&#039;ve been far more sufficient and we wouldn&#039;t have lost everything.<br /><br />What are you guys planning to do from here? Any idea where we go if the forum shuts down?

				Anyone been able to register with BMR?<br /><br />Not Sure Oz. Its a mystery, was thinking BMR, maybe sheep, will see how it goes.<br /><br />Its all pretty fishy, and you are 100% right as many have said with the amount of $$ involved with the site surely it doesnt boil down to 1 guy , that would be ridiculous. Having said that if it was you would you trust this type of &#039;empire&#039; to someone else? <br /><br />And the whole picture on the mainsite is a little dodge. My hope is that its &#039;part&#039; of the backup plan in someway. <br /><br />I dont believe the forums are going anywhere too soon. I would have thought LE would have kept the mainsite open to gather info, maybe thats the intention with the forums?<br /><br />And the BTC in limbo is crazy as well, it pretty much f&#039;s up the entire economy. Certainly put a dint in the standard of living for some folk ;p<br /><br />Blah - so much speculation, been reading all this for way too many hours now. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				We&#039;ll always be able to get in touch with as well (see sig) - I know we&#039;re all hoping and praying this is a ploy to dupe US LE and allow us to at least access our accounts to cancel orders and for anyone to be able to retrieve our BTC. I&#039;d recommend everyone keep a regular eye on the forums and keep each others emails in mind in case we need to get in touch, we&#039;re all in the same boat but the show will go on, there is no stopping us - within 12 hours of SR going down I can think of about 5 others who are working on bigger and better trading websites as we speak so its definitely not a deterrent.<br /><br />Best case scenario we have a 72 hour window where we can do all of the above so noone loses out OR SR is backed up somewhere else with a team behind it operating from like.. Ukraine and we continue business as usual. Worst case scenario its a lesson in which vendors have learned a lesson worth thousands of dollars but again, it won&#039;t stop us, I just hope all the Aussies flock to one place so we can have our own mini Aussie community like before.<br /><br />Still can&#039;t wrap my head SR boiling down to ONE PERSON with eyes on many users empires and all these BTC being handed over to the US government, there has to be more to it and I&#039;m hoping we&#039;re notified very soon.

				Yeah this is getting twilight zone imo...one article quotes his grandmother, and says he graduated from a full scholarship chemistry degree from the University of Texas. Uhh, DPR was a chemist? Considering what Silk Road does one might expect to find him in another aspect of the business.<br />And wait, he was raking in money - enough at LEAST to supposedly pay $150,000 in cash to have someone &#039;rubbed out&#039; to protect his business, and yet lived in a rented apartment that he paid for in cash, under an assumed name, to which he had fake ID - not drugs, which might constitute a possession charge, but fake ID across international (Canadian) borders - shipped right to this home address. <br /><br />W T F.<br /><br />He can order 10 different drivers licenses but he can&#039;t get a fucking PO box??! Has the site automatically set up to log in from &#039;trusted&#039; computers without a password - are you serious?? That&#039;s the kind of shit even the most moronic small-time end-user knows is just looking for trouble.<br /><br />Personally, I think about 80% of it is bullshit designed to panic SR users into thinking the &#039;system&#039; is compromised.<br /><br />LE are well-aware that shutting down SR is pointless unless they can undermine faith in the system that worked for so long. It&#039;s only by scaring the users into thinking they&#039;re going to get busted that they can ever &#039;win&#039;. Otherwise there&#039;ll just be another DPR, and another.<br /><br />If this proves anything it&#039;s that the system was vulnerable to human stupidity, more so than technical error.<br /><br />The person they described is not a person who could have evaded detection for so long. I think the authorities are being played for fools. Not that I&#039;ve actually seen a press conference or press release yet. Only comments from unnamed sources. Statements lifted from a court document whose source remains unconfirmed, at least last time I checked.<br /><br />AFP wouldn&#039;t be able to resist thumping their chest if they&#039;d done this, even accidentally - not sure why FBI would supposedly crack something like this wide open and then take no credit in public.

				Got a couple of PM&#039;s so just for more people looking for an answer - yes all orders made before the crash were sent out, I started packing everything about 12am (AU) and by the time I clicked &quot;CONFIRM&quot; to let you know your orders were about to be on there way out the site was taken down.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping every other vendor has gotten out all their pending orders that they could, I am with you, we lose a lot of money doing this but hey, it isn&#039;t our customers fault and I&#039;m not going to make them pay for US LE being the pricks they are.<br /><br />Glad we have the forums - but what happens if the forums go down? Anyone able to inform me on where we go from there? I haven&#039;t interacted with others much on here so its about time I did :)
