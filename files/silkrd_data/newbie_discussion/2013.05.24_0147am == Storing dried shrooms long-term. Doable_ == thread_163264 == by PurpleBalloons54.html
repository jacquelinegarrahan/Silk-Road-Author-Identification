				As long as their dried properly to start with and kept in a cool, dry spot they should keep for a long time in my experience. Ive got a few grams left from a bag that Ive been dipping into for the last 5 years or so. Theyve not lost any potency in that time, bags not even an airtight one. Keep em cool dry and airtight and you shouldnt have any probs at all.

				Longterm is very possible if dry enough. I use my food dehydrator to dehydrate them and 18 months later I can not see or&nbsp; taste any difference. Fan dry is not the best but could work fine if you let a dessican with it (the DO NOT EAT pouch found in shoe boxes). I keep them in an air tight masson jar with a small pouch of dessican so absolutely no humidity can come in, and no bacteria can grow, leaving my shrooms to stay in a perfect shape for very long time.

				A few years ago I found a jar of shrooms I had buried 10 years before and forgotton about,&nbsp; I store them with Silica Gel as per Komdaz,&nbsp; The contents where fine and dry and got us trippin as if they were last months!<br /><br />So as everyone has said as long as they are absolutely dry the psylocybin seems to be stable for a very long time :) <br /><br /><br />

				I use an air-tight glass jar with some silica gel sachets. I keep the jar inside a shoebox so it&#039;s away from the light. Seems to do the trick.

				Just adding to what the estimable guys have already said, but best possible practice is air-tight sealed in the minimum amount of air (ie vacuum bag) with a desicant sachet, then store in the fridge.<br /><br />But just eat &#039;em all up is better!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Take care.

				Just remembered too, if you chop them up a bit and stir them into a jar of honey, they keep for at least a year as well; the honey goes a long way to masking the taste, especially when you spread it on toast! <br />Watch the dosage though, me and a friend got seriously fucked up once on 2 slices of toast! It was a third party who&#039;d given us the stuff so we didnt realise how much we were actually taking haha!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Never thought about the freezer, and considering what I do for a living, that&#039;s pretty stupid of me really! haha&nbsp; :P

				Low temp + No light + minimal moisture = long lifetime (as in many many years)
