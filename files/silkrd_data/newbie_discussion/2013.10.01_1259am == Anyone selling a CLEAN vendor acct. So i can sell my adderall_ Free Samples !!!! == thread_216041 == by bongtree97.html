				Basically Im RX&#039;ed adderall, Being a benzo lover I have no use for these orange beasts! <br />Currently ATM I have over 300# 20 mg IR with a guarantee of 90 a month. I NEED a vendor account to sell these suckers. <br /><br />I can trade adderall for the account, or buy it. I have approx $320 in coins ATM...<br /><br />The account MUST BE CLEAN AND LEGIT AND NO SCAMMERS! <br /><br />Also, once I set up the vendor account, To show these loser/scammer adderall sellers how to keep customers and make them happy, I will be giving away for the first 10-15 people free samples.<br />&nbsp;I just ask you pay the $6.00 in priority shipping w/tracking shipping and of course ask that you<br /><br />!!!! PLEASE LEAVE HONEST FEEDBACK.!!!!!<br /><br />I want to show people SR isnt all full of scammers and lowlifes who steal and are greedy. And run off with your hard earned money. Ive been personally affected by this and its the worst feeling.. <br /><br />After the samples, I will be selling them for $11-12/ea depending on the demand. Pretty fair, yes/no? <br /><br />Im just trying to make some money while getting my Nursing degree, not trying to be some Tony Montana/Drug lord lol <br /><br />If anyone whos a vendor has any tips for newbie vendors, like how to do fake return addresses, where should I ship them, paying for postage, just little things like that I would be VERY GRATEFUL! <br /><br />I want to run an honest &quot;business&quot; and I work in Health Care and honestly like to make people happy. <br /><br />I hate doing this but if ANYONE is interested in helping me out to either sell me a Vendor account for a reduced rate or even donate so I can open a Vendor account I will reward with adderall! I really cant reiterate enought how much I hate these things. <br /><br />Give me a blunt, some bars and thats all I need to have a good time. :P <br /><br />Thanks for reading, any questions, concerns, comments or if you want to bitch at me for asking for help (lol) you know where to reach me hahaha

				Im about 160$ short....I have well over that in adderall but im not the type to hustle on the street to make the money needed to get the vendor account. <br /><br />Thats why I said I would trade adderall for the rest of the $$ need to open the account. <br /><br />there are plenty of escrow sites that can hold the bits from the buyer and when they receive the adds the coins will be dispensed to me and than VOLIA! I can open an account :) <br /><br />And bitcoins are expensive atm, I was hoping they would go back down to the 70-80$ price tag but Im not going to hold my breath : /

				Well this is kind of ironic. <br /><br />You are not allowed to make any kind of sales (or trades) on the forum, unless you already have a seller account! This also means that you are not allowed to trade product, for a seller account (or part of it).<br /><br />So this would be a very bad way to get a vendor account, seeing as it is against the rules, and if I were an admin, I would be waiting for someone to take you up on your offer, and then i would ban you as a vendor for breaking the rules! I know this makes me sound like an asshole, but I believe that people learn far more from their actions if the consequence of these actions is something that hurts you one way or another! Just suck it up, and get the money some other way (borrow them from a friend, put money aside for a while, or something like that).
