				All,<br />Hey everyone. I&#039;m new to SR and today I had a vendor cancel my order. No comments, message, etc. Since I am new it was only my third order ever and my second with that vendor. Any idea why they would do that? I messaged him/her some questions after the first order, one asking if it was ok to order so soon from the same vendor and another safety question or two, nothing major. I never heard back, that was 3-4 days ago. Then yesterday I put in a new order. Much larger than the first because I was still trying things out with the first order. The new one was $450. Anyone know if just asking questions would cause someone to do this? I don&#039;t know what the etiquette is for this stuff, lol.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Um hm, confused, the last order you put in for 450 was that with seller that canceled and hasn&#039;t answered back?<br /><br />I&#039;m new so I don&#039;t know much, but I imagine asking questions is fine.&nbsp; When the order was canceled was your money refunded?

				The first order that he/she already filled and I got great service, was $180. The second order was the $450 that was canceled.

				Yes, I read their page and nothing. They even have a &quot;banned&quot; list and I&#039;m not on it, so I&#039;m just confused. I went ahead and ordered from someone else, but that vendor was of the with the 5mg that I prefer, that ships US to US, so I&#039;m bummed. I sent him/her a message, maybe they&#039;ll answer. But since they didn&#039;t answer my first message with the questions, I&#039;m not holding my breath, lol.<br /><br />On the blessing in disguise response, you could be right, lol. I&#039;m just trying to figure it out because if it was something I did, I don&#039;t want to do it again and not have vendors that will ship to me : )

				Now I got it, yeah that could just mean he didn&#039;t have enough to cover your order so he canceled.&nbsp; May get back to you when he is back in stock?&nbsp; Must have been good to order again so.

				Or he&#039;s not prepared to take the risk of the higher order from a newish buyer.&nbsp; Get a few more stats and try again.

				I would agree with the risk for a larger order from a newbie, especially when you talked security
