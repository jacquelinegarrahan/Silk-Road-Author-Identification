				Hey,<br /><br />sorry for extreme newbieness and likely slowness, but why would sellers hesitate to ship to new users?<br /><br />Regardless of whether the package arrives or is lost or isn&#039;t sent, it has already been paid for. There would be no need for a new user not to finalise the transaction, apart from... pure spite. Is it that the bitcoins in an unfinalised/unresolved transation don&#039;t eventually go to the seller, at least not fully (I don&#039;t know), but to SR itself?<br /><br />Or is it for the fear of receiving inappropriately low feedback from them? Or just because of the loss of time involved in a likely resolution, even though such resolutions are, I imagine, always resolved in favour of the seller?<br /><br />Also hello.

				Good question, I&#039;m wondering the same thing myself.<br /><br />I suppose it could be feedback, other vendors could try to sabotage competitors or it could just be the resolution center. If you take something to resolution you could potentially extend it indefinitely until a refund is reached. Most vendors offer some type of refund so they would be losing however much they offered a refund for.<br /><br />-Mel

				Yes, but assuming that sellers never give undeserved refunds, and assuming that buyers know this, there is no need for buyers to try to resolve a legit transaction instead of just pay. So why would they not pay?<br /><br />Logic hurts. :)

				It&#039;s because there are some people in this world who are dishonest and will take anything they think they can get away with taking.&nbsp; Some buyers claim it never arrived to try and get a reship, or a 50% discount.&nbsp; The buyer and vendor either come to an agreement, or Silk Road support steps in and makes a decision for them.<br /><br />Your assumptions are not warranted.&nbsp; Vendors do sometimes give undeserved refunds.&nbsp; It&#039;s also not up to them.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to SR.

				I should probably point out here that there is a reserved section of the forums for vendors, and there are lists that are shared with problematic buyers on them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve even heard of it going so far as to post the actual address for particularly problematic buyers who switch names, etc..&nbsp; It&#039;s not a good idea to scam people, but it still happens.<br />
