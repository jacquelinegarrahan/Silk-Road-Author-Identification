By God I bet E. L.

This is your trade, your career, your profession. The idea, typically, is to blend right the fuck in. NOT look out of the ordinary in anyway. Go move all your work in harry patter books, see how many loads you knock off before the judge is throwing football numbers at you. HAHA.<br /><br />Now, per say your a large scale smuggler, heavy, making power moves. Ok, then yes, you can set something up to smuggle your gear in books. Only it wouldnt just be a load of books, it would be a facade publishing company, or BS bookstore LLC. or something. All of which is done every day and night, since the beginning of drug smuggling/dealing. Whos to say that some one hasnt already used books as their front for their drug operations?<br /><br />Some people from around my way where just pinched. 23 people, all doing 25 or better in federal lock up. They where using a chain of used car dealers, to smuggle their bricks in and out of the states.

But this thread shouldn&#039;t be taken seriously in any shape or form. I just made it as a joke to reference how disgusting the books are and how no one in their right mind would ever look inside of them because of what they contain unless you are completely insane. lol. making them the perfect drug hiding/smuggling containers.

				for personal use amounts, I found boxes that come with technology products to be ideal. Stuff that comes with PC parts, mp3 players, video game systems, etc. Obviously, odor is an issue for some drugs which must be addressed in other ways. But for small things like blotters, powders, or pills, I tend to keep it in items that can be filled with a legitimate product and look like something a regular citizen would actually have a reason to be carrying around in their car.

				Hiding in plain sight is the best.&nbsp; The more common everyday looking, the better.&nbsp; Also too, the movers and shakers have their own planes or they steal small planes from small airstrips for dump runs.&nbsp; It happens sorta near the border.

Id say vacuum is probably the best place to hide your stash at the end of the day compared to a computer due to it being unlikely of being confiscated if they suspected you have been buying drugs online unless like I previously said they come with sniffer dogs then not even a vacuum or a candy jar wont do.

(had to use pliers each time so it&#039;s nice and tight) might have to shorten the ink cart in it for more space.<br />I ended up taking the cartridge out, but leaving the TIP in so it still looked legit, but would not mark (dried out marker full of goodies for a week in the toolbox is not uncommon). <br /><br />of course neither of these would be very safe in an airport, but they are quite functional in everyday life.

				I like the marker idea. Anybody ever buy a false can (WD-40, Monster drink, etc.). I bet cops are definitely on to that stuff. With that marker you&#039;re good to go I bet because you can&#039;t open it. However, tool marks may be a giveaway under closer inspection.

				Without reading over previous posts, i&#039;ll just add that it really depends on who you are trying to hide it from.&nbsp; for normal everyday stuff, i like the magnetic box up underneath the car chasis somewhere if i&#039;m trying to keep something out of the house.&nbsp; there a lot of good nooks and crannies down there.&nbsp; obviously not great for something like a roadblock with K9s, but good for normal everyday use to keep prying eyes at bay.

Keep a bunch of computer junk around so it doesn&#039;t seem out of place. <br /><br />Also very carefully cut heatsink pipes and clean out the coolant and you could probably fit a reasonable amount in there.<br /><br />Power supplies could also hold a decent amount of product.<br /><br />Could work.

				Davey Jones locker contains the souls of many who thought they could win.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another one is; a buddy of mine has a shop with all kinds of tools.&nbsp; Its very easy to bore out the top 12 inches of a 6x6 fence post, put your stash in, and cut a piece of wood to plug it.&nbsp; Then put it with the rest of the wood that hasn&#039;t been used yet.<br /><br />Another good one is; a guy I know lives in a second story 2 family apartment building.&nbsp; He managed to make a hideaway using one of the steps on the stairs going up to his place.&nbsp; He gets raided, nothing is ever in his house.&nbsp; That oughta drive the cops nuts.
