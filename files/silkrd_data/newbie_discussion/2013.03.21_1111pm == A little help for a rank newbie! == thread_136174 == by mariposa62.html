				Any help, experience, encouragement would be appreciated!&nbsp; I am trying to get my feet under me on SR and after about a day of reading the wiki and the forums, I am more confused than ever about bitcoin.&nbsp; I understand the concept, no problem there.&nbsp; Im a little confused as to the exact relationship between the bitcoin exchange, the bitcoin wallet, and how the bitcoins actually move around, but I&#039;ll figure that out.&nbsp; My first problem is conflicting information.&nbsp; Reading the forums is nothing but &quot;bitfloor is the best!&quot;, &quot;no, bitfloor sux, use bitstamp!&quot;, &quot;bitstamp is for losers, use bitinstant!&quot;, &quot;bitinstant got hacked, use bitqueef!&quot;.&nbsp; Can anyone cut through the BS and tell me a good reliable setup that they have been using for more than a few days that they are happy with.&nbsp; I need an exchange and a wallet, right?&nbsp; Is there a step I am missing?&nbsp; My priorities are, 1. Security/Anonymity&nbsp; 2. Cost&nbsp; 3. Speed.&nbsp; (I should also mention that I am planning on paying with cash, probably at BofA or 7-11, something like that).<br /><br />Should I use a local (USB key) wallet or an online wallet?<br /><br />I have noticed some people suggesting that fake names and email addresses should be used at some points of the process (I think that was when buying bitcoins for cash).&nbsp; If I set up an online wallet will that need to be linked to a working email address?&nbsp; Or should that be fake info as well?<br /><br />Sorry if these are stupid questions, I just want to be able to do this without making any rookie mistakes.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I&#039;m always in search of a better way to buy bitcoins myself, so not an expert by any means. <br /><br />All I can tell you is I&#039;ve switched back and forth from using&nbsp; bitinstant (at least half a dozen times) and a vendor by the name of Sugar Mama converting MoneyPaks to bit coins. MP to BTC takes 4 or 5 days lately through her, though. <br /><br />I am sure someone with way more experience will happen by and help more. Good luck shopping.

				I used Bitfloor without any issues. The biggest problem I had was the fee my bank charged to get the money to them by transfer, cost about $70 in total since it was transferred from another country. I would probably either try to exchange direct with a person in my country next time or find a local exchange. Bitfloor does have a wallet and SR also has a wallet included in your account, so once I had converted the money to BTC in Bitfloor I transferred it straight to my SR wallet. You don&#039;t need an email address for a wallet.

				I don&#039;t know what country you are based in, but in the US there are a lot of happy customers with BitFloor and I&#039;m one of them. Only used them 3 times but it&#039;s been flawless each time (although a guy asked me today for a phone number which I made up on the spot) You go to BitFloor, start an account (takes less time than to make a fake email address) and tell the the amount that you want to deposit. They then take you to a page with all the details, the account number etc. Print out the page to take to Bank of America. Tell them you want to make a cash deposit to your stockbroker (they also sell stocks as well as BTC) You give them a little extra for the transfer to BTC. It was around 17-18 dollars for about $1000 worth of BTC. So you deposit about $1018, Bank of America doesn&#039;t charge anything. By the time you get home it&#039;s credited to you account. Then you go to the &#039;trade&#039; portion and you can decide to buy at the market price (prices are at bottom of page) or do a limit order (you can choose to buy or sell at a prearranged price-obviously if the BTC doesn&#039;t go down to the price you set the limit order to, then they won&#039;t execute)<br />So then the money is converted to BTC and you can then use your client (I use the BTC client on my computer) to download the &#039;coins&#039;. Or you can use blockchain.info to deposit to a online wallet, or you can deposit directly&nbsp; to SR. I download them to my computer first, although there is no reason to (unless you use your name somewhere in the purchase process, but you won&#039;t do that)<br />I wouldn&#039;t use my name anywhere in the process. There is no need and you&#039;ll have to &#039;tumble&#039; your coins unless you feel &#039;lucky&#039;!<br />A new guy (like me, maybe a little longer) had a guide I liked http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112029.0.<br />And Astor had a good guide too, he&#039;s a longtime &#039;hero&#039; member, do a search, you couldn&#039;t go wrong there. <br />BitCopia (check spelling, DONT make mistakes there-there are sites that look exactly like the real sites that are there to steal your BTC, read the threads relating to that) has a similar setup, except you use Wells Fargo. I haven&#039;t used that company though.

				Bitfloor rules. I&#039;ve had no issues. It&#039;s very simple Don&#039;t use a fake email, get a tormail address for your bitfloor account. They need a valid email to send confirmations to. Other than that I&#039;ve never had to use any names or ID at the bank or anything. Fees are low. You can&#039;t ask for more.<br /><br />I deposit coin direct to SR. I have a free wallet with blockchain for SR to send coins to as a backup.

				Wow!&nbsp; Thanks for the help guys.&nbsp; I had been looking at Bitfloor but had been kind of worried after reading about them getting hacked late last year.&nbsp; But it looks like the main guy over there has been bustin&#039; his ass to make things right for the people who have money with bitfloor.&nbsp; All the recent reviews ive read have been positive.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the US so I&#039;ll probably go with them.&nbsp; Thanks for the quick replies!
