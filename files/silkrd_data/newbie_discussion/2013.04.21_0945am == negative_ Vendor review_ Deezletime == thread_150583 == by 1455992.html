				So i ordered from this guy for my first ever SR purchase. This man straight took care of me. I ordered 4 stamps. Dude sent SIX.<br />His stealth is really good, i would open this shit in front of non users.<br />Quality is fairly good. There isn&#039;t MUCH powder in the bags. My last weighed about 40mg&#039;s, but hey, quality over quantity.<br />Every one of my experiences with him has been great except one. <br /><br />Earlier this week i purchased 1 stamp. The next morning, the package was not marked in transit,and another vendor screwed me due to btc fluctuations and he was unhedged. whatever. I figured since it hadn&#039;t been shipped yet, i&#039;d add 2 more stamps to my order, so i didn&#039;t pay shipping. I sent Deeze a message and told him this. 5 hours or so later, my first is marked &quot;in transit&quot;. I recieve a sort of rude message from him telling me the order were too far apart, and the first package was already being shipped when they got my order. He told me &quot;next time if you are placing multiple orders that are spaced apart please let us know so we can delay the shipping because we try to get everything out as quick as possible and same day if possible, understand?&quot;<br /><br />Whatever i thought, two packages. I felt bad for him losing money and decided to pay for the second shipping anyways by sending him it directly. I actually sent him OVER what shipping cost. The following day, the package is marked in transit. Being nice because i like him, i went ahead and FE&#039;d my first order to help him out with cashflow. Cool. So i ask him (total of 2 or 3 times) for the ETA on the packages, and he ignores the question. Finally, three days ago he send me this. &quot;just to let you know that your priority order went out today with an eta for 04/19...both went out in the same package.&quot;<br /><br />Uhm.. I was told they were separate , AND i paid for extra shipping. He replies and says he&#039;s sorry, that message was not meant for me, it was meant for someone else. I assume this is true because Friday i got my package of my first order. I might add this time shipping took longer than last. I placed the order 5 days ago, and used priority. Last time it took two days. I&#039;m not really gonna complain though, as it was still relatively fast. They were great quality as always. So Saturday rolls around and i receive my other package, extremely excited. i quickly get home and open it, and locate the stamps. These were odd. They were different stamps than the ones the day before, and generally Deeze&#039;s stamps have ONE strip of tape to keep them closed. They were COVERED in tape, like WRAPPED up. Hard as fuck to open. I got my mirror in my lap, and opened one. The second one i opened due to the tape like exploded, and i had to recover the flying powder. &quot;Whoops! Whatever, it&#039;s my b-day&quot; i thought, &quot;I&#039;m bout to shoot two and get high as FUCK.&quot; Keep in mind, i have very minimal tolerance. ONE of deezle&#039;s usual bags gets me very well, and 30-45mg of oxy does aswell. <br /><br />So i prep the two, prep the shot, and go to work. Injected! woah!.... and... nothing. The fuck? Maybe i missed.... No.. no miss... but HOLY SHIT i&#039;ve NEVER gotten such a bad histamine reaction, especially from Deeze&#039;s bags. It was worse than a morphine sulphate reaction.. Huh. so I open the third and load it, and shoot it, trying to get atleast something out of a bad situation. I get a slight feeling after shooting the third, but no where near where i should be. Three of Deezle&#039;s USUAL(usual meaning what i&#039;ve received twice, both equal) bags would have damn near killed me. What a fucking buzzkill! I waited ALL week for these packages and only got 2 actually usable stamps, and used them the night before my b-day, since i was expecting 3 the next day. I&#039;ve messaged Deezle, but he&#039;s gone for 5 days and wont be reading messages. I don&#039;t want a refund, because i&#039;d just buy more with it. I simply want a reship of the stamps i&#039;ve been getting. How do i go about this? Should i contact SR or just wait for deezle to get back from his away time? I really hope Deezle will work this out with me, because i was nice enough to pay my shipping which he told me not to worry about. He seems like a really cool guy, and i held off on giving him a 1/5 on both because i&#039;m gonna try to talk to him about it. But i took a picture of the histamine reaction i got. I was looking to buy his 10 bag listing, but i&#039;m VERY iffy now, because of the bags i got saturday and don&#039;t want to get the same stamps.&nbsp; He says he doesn&#039;t handle the bags, it&#039;s what he gets from his source(the amount of tape was fucking stupid though), and i cant be mad at him, he doesn&#039;t MAKE it, it&#039;s just not what i paid for.<br /><br /><br />What do you think SR? What should i do?

				I use the road almost exclusively for dope so far, and am trying to test out as many vendors as possible until I find one or two to do the majority of my business with. So far I have completed 2 orders with deezletime, and to be quite honest I have been very happy with this vendors communication, speed of processing and shipping, the quality of his product, and the price. Will I am still trying out other vendors, it often seems that anytime I use someone else I regret NOT ordering from deezletime. He is professional, and over all a good value.
