				Hello All of SR!<br /><br />I have been browsing SR seeing some of the ecig pens such as the DabR on display for some outrageous prices. I happen to own a local business for selling these. I might be interested in selling on the road or independently if I could get some publicity! My Pens are Basically going to be giving you the same quality without the expensive price! They do the exact same thing but are not the name brand &quot;DabR&quot; You can still load concentrates, BHO, Oils, and waxes. I have yet to try any actual bud because I have an actual volcano vape for that! If I could get some hype on my product and a few people interested in some orders<br />I know I am very new here but I seen the vape pen market being dominated &amp; you guys should have a chance to experience this!<br /><br />First I would like to start my product intro by saying that my price will be at least HALF of what GreenOvenDoor and PlantDepot are advertising, $100+! Also when conducting business with me you will have the option to make deals when buying more or more accessories.<br /><br />Heres some info on the product!<br />VERY STEALTH (Perfect Odorless way to toke at work, school, college wherever!)<br />Electronic vaporizer length: 115mm<br />Normal working voltage: 3.3-4.2V<br />Life of Battery: 300 full charges<br />Weigth of single vaporizer: 35g<br />Charging time: 2-3 hours<br />Battery capacity: 650mAh<br /><br />I CAN CUSTOMIZE ORDERS, SELL KITS &amp; MAKE DEALS!!!<br /><br />What I have-<br />E Liquids (really don&#039;t need them for your use)<br />Cartridges<br />Atomizers<br />Clearomizers<br />Batteries<br />Chargers<br /><br />I have read numerous reviews of other fellow smokers using the exact same pen I am selling for all their trippy stick needs!!!<br />I communicate.<br />I have good prices.<br />I ship everywhere.<br /><br />10000000% LEGAL TO SHIP!<br /><br />SO IF YOU GUYS ARE DOWN FOR SOME CHEAP CONCENTRATE VAPING DEVICES HMU WITH A PRIVATE MSG ON HERE!<br /><br />Basically guys Im making this thread to test the waters and see what my potential market is &amp; who would be interested.<br /><br />ALWAYS WILLING TO TRADE!<br /><br />I can aslo throw in some freebies with orders upon request such as how to make your own tincture to put in, maintinence, replacing parts(never had this problem before), ect ect<br /><br />When the thread grows THERE WILL BE FREE VAPE PENS GIVEN AWAY! ;D<br />

				There are several methods on the internet for making the oil. I am using mine to stop smoking cigs at the moment so Im just filling mine with a small nicotine cartridge. However, when it comes to MMJ concentrates it works like this. All of these oils, BHO, tinctures, and so on that you see on SR or that you can easily make or buy at a dispensery can be made to work in my vape pens!

Sorry if this sounds shotty as a businessman I just don&#039;t have the money for a vendor account atm!
