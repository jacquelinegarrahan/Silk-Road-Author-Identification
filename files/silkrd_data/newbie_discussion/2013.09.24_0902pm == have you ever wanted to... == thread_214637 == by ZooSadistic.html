				No but I did want to beat the living shit out of someone I saw kick their dog and it was the most satisfying thing i have ever done and Id do it again every time I catch a weak piece of shit hit a animal.&nbsp; Too much of a pussy to hit a man because they know they will get their teeth kicked in faggots

				Nope, but I do occasionally want to kick toddlers in the head. Something about the height differential is just tempting. They&#039;re like little soccer stands. <br />Unfortunately, I have this thing called a heart, so I don&#039;t do weird sadistic shit. Oh well.
