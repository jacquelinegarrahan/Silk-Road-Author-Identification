				I have been receiving so many heart touching trip reports by people who have less than 50 posts on the forum, so I decided to start a second vendor review/trip report thread for my (TheAnswer2Everything)&#039;s DMT and Changa blends.<br /><br />Here you go guys and gals with less than 50 posts on the SR forums, feel free to post your reviews/feedback and/or trip reports in this thread or if you have 50+ posts in my main thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147664.0<br /><br />My changa blends are 50% DMT infused unique, smokeable/vapable concoctions of various natural DMT potentiators. Changa is massively popular in Europe and Australia but has not yet gained the notoriety it deserves here in the USA/North America (on SR, that is). <br /><br />Changa changes lives.<br /><br />Have you ever heard of ayahuasca? The DMT containing ancient/interdimensional/shamanistic brew that allows one to explore divine unknown dimensions, entities, and realms beyond anything you could ever imagine. <br /><br />The life-changing experience that allows a person to gain knowledge of what happens after we shed our human existence.<br /><br />Your human life time is just a blink of time in the infinite dimension.<br /><br />This earth is just a grain of sand in these undiscovered wondrously beautiful universes.<br /><br />My changa blends will softly guide you through this life changing experience. Ayahuasca and changa are very similar in their effects, yet changa is MUCH more gentle and easier to work with. Simply pack it into a pipe/bowl/vaporizer, or sprinkle some into a joint and gradually work your way up into hyperspace. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Ayahuasca is VERY important, but it&#039;s not for everyone, it is a VERY intense experience. Changa IS for everyone, and everyone who has a good soul or wants to improve their life should at least try it once. It&#039;s the most blissful journey/high/trip you will ever take, guaranteed.<br /><br />In the few short months of selling my precious changa blends on SR, the substance has already changed lives and profoundly influenced many souls who have sampled my changa blends. Proof can be seen in my main trip report thread and many more are coming. I have been receiving many messages on SR from people who don&#039;t have a 50+ post count so they cannot share their experiences on that thread yet, and that&#039;s why I&#039;m creating this thread in the Newbie section. With their permission, I also may post a couple of the trip reports here on my threads because they are truly inspiring and they might just bring a tear to your eye.<br /><br />You will not find changa like this ANYWHERE else in the world. If you do, please let me know. These are very unique, carefully crafted, special blends, VERY special. So special that I am reluctant to sell them off, but after reading a few trip reports, the effort is well worth it to share it with you all!<br /><br />For example, our first changa blend is 50% DMT infused into 20x banisteriopsis caapi root bark infused into b. caapi leaf. The b. caapi is first extracted onto b. caapi leaves for this blend, we extract the b. caapi alkaloid from b. caapi root bark and infuse it onto the b.caapi leaves 20 times to create the 20x b. caapi root bark infused b.caapi leaf potency. The b. caapi serves as an MAOI and magnificently potentiates and extends the DMT trip<br /><br />I am so grateful to be able to share these gifts with you all and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your life changing experiences with me and this wonderful community.<br /><br />TA2E Vendor Profile Page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b1e263158b<br />TA2E OFFICIAL Review Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147664.0<br />TA2E &quot;Forum Newbs&quot; Review Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148796.0

				To be quite honest, the search for a consistent and quality source of this medicine is what led me to the Road. I have only been able to journey once before but it was enough to start a momentous wave in my life that I have been riding ever since. Unfortunately, since my first excursion I haven&#039;t even come into contact with anyone possessing this great and powerful tool. Enter, TA2E. I&#039;m really impressed with your approach and general awareness of the power this medicine contains. I&#039;m looking forward to test your Changa blends, as that is something I haven&#039;t yet tried and it seems you take great care and affection into what you concoct. I&#039;ll have to wait before I actually can sample because last month wasn&#039;t kind financially&nbsp; :( But I&#039;ve made my choice of vendor definitely, favorited on the main site. Also, I keep trip reports of all my trips (mushrooms, LSD, my one and only DMT trip) just for personal reference so I would love to share my thoughts and insights after testing out your wares. I see on your vendor page you&#039;ve only 3g&#039;s left at the moment so I do hope the stars align and I can purchase before you&#039;re bone dry. Thanks again and I look forward to journeying with your Changa soon.&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D
