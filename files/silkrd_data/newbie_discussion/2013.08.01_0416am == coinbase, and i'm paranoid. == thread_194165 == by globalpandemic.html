				So I&#039;m going to sign up for coinbase, and I have to link my personal acct to coinbase. I would buy and send my bitcoins from coinbase to my electrum wallet using tails. Then to my SR acct. How can LE trace bitcoins? Do they have to be a vendor? What additonal steps can i take? And how do people get busted on SR? Just curious and mostly paranoid. I know its a lot of ?????. Thank you. Long Live Silk Road!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i wanted to answer one more question i would say ppl get busted the most on SR for SUB-par stealth , that would be the biggest issue, research the shit out of your vendor and ask alot of questions about shipping practices.....remember to constantly change your BTC address , after every transaction is actually the best...up to you....but you will be fine, go with your gut

				I was going to make a thread about coinbase, but since there&#039;s one already, maybe I can have my question answered here.<br /><br />I have no cash, so mailing in cash for BTC is not an option. I also cannot use my Debit card to make online transactions. I figure the best way to go is to wire funds through my bank account, so after a bit of research, coinbase seems legit. It will take 2-3 days to verify my account in order for me to wire money through my bank account in exchange for BTC. I will send my purchased bitcoins from coinbase to my bitcoin wallet, then I will deposit them into my SR account. At that point I&#039;ll be able to buy whatever I decide on SR. <br /><br />Anything wrong with that?<br /><br />I know not to sign for packages, always stay in escrow, I&#039;ve done my vendor research, ect.<br />

				Coinbase is the easiest if you can wait. I&#039;ll always remember that hour and a half waiting on btc to transfer but nowhere near as bad as wondering if the money gram worked. Coinbase is the least amount of stress for me and I would recommend it. I&#039;m sure they put you on the do not fly list when u register though. Encrypt your HD with a hidden os, use tails, tor bridges, and try to be behind 7 proxies. Oh and also a VPN but make sure u connected to a neighbors secure wireless by cracking the wep key with backtrack first. Video cameras and guns are a failsafe in case of a raid.
