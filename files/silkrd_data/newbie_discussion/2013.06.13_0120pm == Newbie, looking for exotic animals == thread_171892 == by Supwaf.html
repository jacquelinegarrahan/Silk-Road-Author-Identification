				I&#039;ve decided to get my fifty posts so you poor bastards are going to have to put up with my rant (sorry).<br />After you&#039;ved amassed your menagery of exotic animals, will you maybe move on to owning, caging and controlling various people who interest you?

				You seem to have mistaken me for someone looking to have much more fun.<br />I&#039;m only looking for a specific exotic animal to keep as a pet. Preferably still at cub age to prevent it from deciding one day that it would like my home to itself.

				I posted an earlier thread asking if there were any exotic animal websites on the darkweb to take a look at. I think it&#039;s awful, but the argument was made that some of the exotic animal owners are good people who just love the animals, I understand...but there is still an awful dark element to illegal animal trading. A few people responded, but none were able to provide me with a site or dealers to check out. They made the argument that many who deal exotic animals are old-school and don&#039;t need an outlet like the internet to make sales. Their countries often allow such trading too.... keep an eye out. I&#039;d sure like to take a look, if something like this exists.

				How would you propose to get this shipped to you? Why do the whole anonymous internet payment thing if you still have to meet the person to get the animal, or do they put the damn thing in a box and mail it?

				Shipping animals can be cruel unless done properly.<br /><br />For the most part you ought to use good pet shops, and if you want THE best ever pet (for a man) choose a spider!<br /><br />Tarantula of course.<br /><br />I&#039;ve built a kind of little playground for them. There are lots of varieties and they really are fantastic creatures.<br /><br />Wife hates them.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
