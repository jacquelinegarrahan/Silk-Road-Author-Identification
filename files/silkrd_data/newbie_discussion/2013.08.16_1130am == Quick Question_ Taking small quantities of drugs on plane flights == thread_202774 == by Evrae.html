				Basically I&#039;m going to a festival and I&#039;d rather not waste money on a PO box in a country I&#039;ve never been to before. I also would rather avoid buying shit/overpriced drugs off random strangers at the festival. I&#039;m flying EU to EU and just wanted to take enough MD benzos and acid for myself and a few friends, maybe a little bit extra to shot but I&#039;m not overly fussed. Anyone here who has flown regularly with drugs and are familiar with airport security in the EU? Are there any easy methods for smuggling relatively small quantities through? <br /><br />Thanks very much for any help.

				Hey forgive me for this is my first post on here, finally decided to join the SR forums after deliberating for months. However I am experienced in transportation. With both bad and good experiences.<br /><br />First of all small quantities are not a worry in the EU and are very easily concealable. Packaging must be correct also. If you would care to state where you are flying to and from (just country not exact airport) and i can be of further assistance. Most of the countries are the same and have minimal security however a few you have to watch out for.<br /><br />Look forward to being of assistance.

				There are some other post about this in the newbie section and elsewhere too, so just use the search engine:)<br /><br />But to address your issue briefly, it is totally doable as long as you got small amounts, the key is to be a little creative, inventive.<br />Security all over EU is mostly just basic stuff.<br />Blotters are always easy to hide, and your benzos, take some pills you got a prescription for and put them under there at the bottom or so, just think of a way:)<br />Oh and if you are really paranoid you can always crush them and hide them goooood :D<br />cheers

				Thanks guys. I just wanted to take a few grams of MD, some benzos and a few tabs of acid. Very inexperienced with flying (haven&#039;t flown in over 6 years) so was wondering if it&#039;s best to put it in hand luggage or cargo. I&#039;m flying UK to Croatia.

				I would think you&#039;d be able to easily conceal that on your person.

				If I gave them to my girlfriend and she put them in her bra would that suffice? Was also thinking of putting them bagged up in a bottle of moisturizer or something, would that appear on the scanners? Wouldn&#039;t mind if someone could give me some very specific instructions on where to hide shit as I have said I haven&#039;t flown with drugs before and I&#039;m pretty paranoid about it. Cheers.

				I am not an expert in this area, but it seems to me that cargo baggage gets very little scrutiny.&nbsp; I think this would be safer.&nbsp;

				If its just a few grams then just wrap it well in a little package and stick it up your arse. not even joking here. its the safest option and really easy if its a small amount, just wrap the bag up tight in clingfilm then tape it all up, stick in condom and the rest if obvious.

				Come on dont put it on her, if you wont take it on your person, why should she? Like i said package it well and put it up or your arse, its really not a big issue. Ive transported huge amounts through airports and the only time ive even been caught is when i was grassed up before hand by an enemy.

				I have taken liquid LSD and dropped it into part of my shirt. Later I just suck on my shirt.<br /><br />Works with anything that can be made liquid, like xanax. But be careful of things that smell.

				Flying with drugs inside the EU is no prob at all. Just check it in with your baggage. never tried it with hand-packages though. did that with 1g MDMA 2-3g Speed and 5g pot. No problems.

				If you&#039;re trying to fly with pills, put them in a bottle of similar looking OTC pills. If you&#039;re not allowed to fly OTC, use prescription.

				what i would do is find two different sizes of capsules, and make sure the bigger capsules are legitimate natural supplements in powered form. and i would open up a capsule and put the smaller capsule with your product inside. like a russian doll.<br />

				capsule is a good idea, just open up two and half a g in each and put them in with the originals. just use cheap multivitamins or supplements. with acid, paper is best. but its not on any airport sniffer dogs list of smells.
