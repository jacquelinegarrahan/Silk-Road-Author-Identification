				Hello all!<br /><br />Is there a forum where people can order murders?<br />I&#039;ve read on another subforum on here that a guy wanted to commit suicide (sadly). Perhaps he and/or someone else in a similar situation has gotten a little time to spare...

				I highly doubt that any of the assassination &#039;services&#039; on bmr, or anywhere else within Tor are legit.<br /><br />If it&#039;s keeping you up at night, try some milky hot chocolate drink.

				There is some pretty fucked up shit on the deep web. You might find it fun to think about but if you found what you are looking for, I bet you will shit your pants.

				Unless you have ties to organized crime, there are no hitmen. Seriously, this will go one of two ways for you: A. If you&#039;re lucky, you get scammed, robbed and/or blackmailed. B. You get arrested and the whole world laughs at you as Chris Hansen gleefully narrates the hidden camera video of you &quot;negotiating&quot; with an undercover police officer. <br /><br />Also, do remember that there are on LEO on this board and they would love nothing more than to be able to tie SR to some &quot;murder-for-hire plot.&quot; I can see&nbsp; the headlines already.

				Haha, this is a crazy thread and one of the previous posters is right, it&#039;s not good for SR publicity to have that shit here. However, the internet is a fucked up place and I have no doubt that with enough time or research you would most certainly find someone willing to kill for you. You would probably even find someone who will do it for free, just for kicks. Just bear in mind, it could be you!<br />After all, that German cannibal was able to find someone willing to allow themselves be chopped up and eaten, so this request could be on the lower end of the insane internet stories!

				That would be a hell of a business, getting people to tell you who to kill. It&#039;d be nice really, think of all the traveling and sightseeing you would get to do! Also, you would have plenty of down time when you are stalking targets. You could finish tons of books waiting outside your target&#039;s house for them to come home.
