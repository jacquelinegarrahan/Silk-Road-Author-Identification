				I as well as many other newbies have been experiencing some pretty rotten treatment from some vendors while the BTC bounces up and down. Its apparent in the newbie forums. Because we are newbies and maybe because many of us start ordering small at first-there are vendors that if they are going to &quot;lose&quot; BTC in an order they will cancel your order and claim its because your a newbie. What difference does it make? Everyone starts off as a newbie. I see many vendors who welcome newbies and there are a few that ask for FE only from newbies. So you have to realize being a newbie means no respect. We are nothing to SR at this stage. If it comes down to a vendor losing BTC they dont respect us and figure what are we going to do about it? Many of us are just learning and we are susceptible to their lies and manipulations. we just dont know better-YET. We cant even post in the non-newbie forums yet so what are you going to do? <br />Here is an example: I made an order and had it canceled because im a newbie (even though I offered FE) but I was told to go ahead and order with the vendor but on a different one of the vendors ads. There was nothing in the item description that said &quot;newbies dont order&quot;. There was no difference in the other ad except that now the BTC price had dropped. <br />When do you get out of the newbie category? <br />When do SR members start treating you with respect? If a vendor is going to do selective scamming or short someone its the newbie. If it goes to a claim the vendor gets 50% of your money. If the order is hedged and the vendor cancels it WE the newbies are the ones who lose money. Vendors charge 2-3 times the value for the items they sell and I dont believe they ever &quot;lose&quot; anything even with the BTC going down. They still get far more than what their product sells for locally. What they themselves sell it for locally. You dont think this is their sole outlet do you? None of these vendors have enough sales at the price they charge to make it a full time job. This is just a way to be greedy and charge way more for the same product you sell in town. So a person on the street gets better treatment then anyone treats each other on SR.<br />What I am proposing is a list. A list that gives vendors names and explains what happened to each newbie. This topic would be open ONLY to newbies to post in. I cant make the full members stop posting here (like they do us until we have 50 postings) I can only ask that they respect us newbies as we respect the full members and their rules. Trying to keep the SR vendor bullying out of this. To give newbies a place to vent and not be afraid of being chewed out. This can be used to warn other newbies so as to not make the same mistake with the same vendor. Also it might help to show patterns of scamming by individual vendors. I know a lot of newbies are afraid to do this. They fear the vendors and upsetting the SR community. Its the age old habit of kissing your dealers ass in hoping they will treat you fair. Remember your self respect. Do you deserve to be treated differently for any reason? Also im not asking for a list bashing vendors. Some of the situations will actually have explanations and we newbies can make mistakes. Just put down the details and the name of your vendor as if you were writing a review. Try to keep emotion out of it. We know its frustrating and your angry. Most of us know by now what good business is and bad business. This isnt personal its business and this is Angieslist for SR.<br />Ebays policy&#039;s are similar to SR in that they protect the buyers and its the sellers that get the short end of the stick if anything. SR is the other way around. Its the vendors that are protected and the buyers suffer. As big as Ebay is and with all the experience they have dont you think they might know something by now? Like the fact that its the buyers that keep their business afloat. You can have all the goods in the world to sell but if you have no one to buy it. No customers or traffic to your site.....<br />SR really only had BMR as real competition (if you can call it that) until recently. BMR with all its policys makes it easy for vendors to rob the buyers so people have stayed with SR but there are new sites popping up like Atlantis and that sheep site (and bitwasp) and out of these some will fade away but some may stay. May flouish. Over at these sites EVERYONE is a newbie. So there are going to be more alternatives to SR. Atlantis even accepts LTC which is more stable than the BTC is. I have said it before but it bears saying again: if you dont think this can happen rememeber MySpace? What happened when Facebook was a better alternative? Where is MySpace now? SR used to be a better community but greed and dishonesty have poisoned a lot of its users.
