				I&#039;m thinking of making a seller account on here to sell adderall. I get 60 30mg IR generic a month. Think I could get enough business to justify the bond? What price would you guys pay? Interested?

				Glad to see another adderall vendor coming aboard.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t as much adderall and dex listed as there was in Jan and Feb last time I bought.&nbsp; I bet a lot of vendors just ran out during finals week for exams. <br /><br />But to answer your questions yes I think at the right price point it would be incredibly easy for you to sell these.&nbsp; I know the person I buy dex off of restocks about once a month and lets their customers know ahead of time when they&#039;ll be posted because if you aren&#039;t on within about a 24 hour period to put your order in they&#039;re gone.&nbsp; So they sell out quick for the right price.&nbsp; <br /><br />The prices since Jan and Feb have gone up though for some reason.&nbsp; Let&#039;s face it, street value for a 30 mg might be $10.&nbsp; You can get more from college kids during finals week because they&#039;re desperate and rich and grades me a lot when you&#039;re paying thousands for college credits, but for the everyday Joe I don&#039;t think most people want to pay more than $15 for one.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s a very competitive and fair price point.&nbsp; You&#039;d make a nice profit and you&#039;d be making customers happy.&nbsp; There are vendors right now selling for $25 a shot.&nbsp; That&#039;s fucking nuts.&nbsp; I&#039;ll never pay that much personally.&nbsp; It&#039;s time we have some vendors step up and price lower so that others vendors will follow suit because it&#039;s out of hand.&nbsp;

				Another thing I was thinking you could try that would get you a little more profit and really help ensure sales is give away a free adderall with every order of say 5 pills.&nbsp; If you charged $20 per pill for 5 for a total of $100, but gave away 1 free adderall with each order then you&#039;d actually be taking in $16.66 per pill ($100 / 6 pills).&nbsp; I can almost guarantee you&#039;ll do better this way than selling for $16.66 per pill alone without any free ones.&nbsp; Your profits would be the same either way, but if someone sees free pill in the product advertisement they&#039;ll jump all over it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame not all vendors think this way.&nbsp; This is how big box retailers so it sometimes.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s a reason the addy prices on the road are so high, the second you lower the prices to a reasonable level you sell out, 60 a month is not going to cut it for reasonable prices. It&#039;s too easy to get on the street and everybody has ADD now. I&#039;d recommend going 5-6 under the other vendors and offer free shipping, sr is certainly better than selling on the street due to the low prices most folks get them at

				I noticed the prices were nuts and had wondered about it. I&#039;m sure any price I set will beat the $3 a pop I&#039;ve been selling them to my roommate for, lol. I&#039;ve been considering throwing in an extra every few orders. The &#039;buy 5 get one free&#039; idea sounds even better, actually. It&#039;s more credible. If I&#039;m making decent profit I have a few hookups I can make use of and try to drop the standard a bit here.<br /><br />How is the Klonopin market? I have quite a few of those, and the street price generally runs pretty low.

				Also, think it will be that hard getting people to buy from me at first? As a new vendor, is it that difficult to earn trust?
