				Title: <strong>TLS Certificate Authority over Tor</strong><br />

				The biggest problem with using TLS/SSL over Tor is that TLS/SSL is designed for using Certificate Authorities (CAs) to verify identity, as opposed to using OpenPGP (i.e. GPG2 or similar) web of trust to verify server authenticity.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of a Tor CA, but I don&#039;t see why such a beast is technically impossible.<br /><br />From what I understand, CAs CAN be hosted over Tor in the same way Tormail works (cheap disposable proxies) or for that matter, Onion.TO (gateway into Tor, only in this case for a single site, the CA).<br /><br />The problem with this is that CAs, even when hosted over Tor, are still a centralized entity, and if the CA were ever raided and/or compromised, would compromise every single website and service that relied on it, and may even be subject to forged certificates to redirect user traffic to a fake site as a result of ICE domain seizure or a sting operation.<br /><br />I do not like Certificate Authorities, but they may be helpful to provide HTTPS or other SSL/TLS validity when certain protocols, such as email, web, IRC, XMPP and others expect valid signed TLS/SSL certificates, and throw exceptions upon encountering non-SSL connections or ports, or self-signed certificates. Some protocols don&#039;t make it easy to manually override rejections of self-signed SSL certs.<br /><br />What do you guys think about an SSL cert signing service over a Tor hidden service?<br /><br />I believe it&#039;s technically possible, but do you think anyone would want it?

				I think there would be a trust deficit in the CA, so would never take off in the first place

S/MIME and SRTP is used for many things, but both rely upon CAs for their security model to work.<br /><br />A TorCA can help minimize the inherent risks involved with clearnet (regulated and government-controlled) CAs such as Comodo and Verisign, even if it doesn&#039;t eliminate them completely.

				I&#039;m intrigued, it could work. Could even lead to a community of trusted anonymous devs on an open source model; assuming one doesn&#039;t exist, being a newbie haven&#039;t explored TOR much yet but find it interesting.<br /><br />If this does take off I don&#039;t mind contributing some dev time, is there a tor based GIT?<br />
