				Lots of weed vendors claim to be selling top shelf weed.&nbsp; My question is if they really have top shelf weed, why risk prison or the hassle of BTCs and shipping since if it is top shelf you can sell it to a dispensary?<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that you can profit more by selling here, then it would have to be a lot more to offset the risk, and I doubt that the profit margins vending here are that large.<br /><br />On the other hand, it could be argued that most of the weed vendors are middle men and so, the above point applies only to growers but not to resellers.&nbsp; However, based on personal experience, I can comfortably say that all the weed I&#039;ve gotten from resellers here have most definitely NOT been top shelf.&nbsp; The weed has been pretty good but no way has it been dispensary top shelf.&nbsp; Not even close.<br /><br />I&#039;d go further and say that the best weed I&#039;ve gotten off the road has consistently been from growers themselves but so far none has been really top shelf.&nbsp; (Actually, there&#039;s been one reseller that I&#039;ve ordered from that has provided true top shelf, Novartis, but that&#039;s because, I think, they actually purchase it from the dispensary, and consequently, their weed is pretty expensive.)<br /><br />Getting back to my question, I don&#039;t think you would vend here if you were a grower and had top shelf.&nbsp; So it would be unlikely to get top shelf from a grower here.<br /><br />The most likely place to get top shelf weed here then would be from a reseller but none of them have any.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why can&#039;t we get any top shelf weed here?&nbsp; My love for weed is making me contemplate a move to CA or WA.

				Anonymity? No one wants to be known as a drug dealer.<br /><br />Plus, most people are actually growing their shit illegaly and im sure that their are certain rules a dispensary must follow when purchasing from people.

				In many ways vending online is safer. You dont have to know a lot of people in person that can get you in trouble if they get caught up.
