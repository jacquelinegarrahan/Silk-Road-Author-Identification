				Can take anything from a few minutes to a few hours. Just be patient, and don&#039;t wear out the refresh button. lol ;) <br /><br /><br />I assume you *are* talking about a btc deposit into your SR wallet?

				That&#039;s okay then, just gave me a sweat when it didn&#039;t come straight through. Yeah, I used a mix send feature for a bit more anonymity do you think that would slow it up?

Within 1-2 hours or less.<br /><br />A bitcoin transfer? Could take around 1 hour or more, depending on network traffic. You can enter the btc address you transferred the coins to into blockchain.info and it will tell you the status of the transaction and how many confirmations it&#039;s got. When you hit 6 confirmations, it should be complete.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had transfers take over 2 hours when the network is very busy.<br /><br />Did you pay the 0.0005 btc processing fee? It&#039;s not required but it does give you priority in processing (or so I&#039;m told). It still takes a good 45 min to a hour with that.<br /><br />EDIT: That&#039;s on average. I have had to wait overnight for a transfer to complete, but that&#039;s more rare.

				I&#039;ve had transfers take 24+ hours.&nbsp; Sometimes things are delayed and moving slowly.&nbsp; As long as it shows up on blockchain, you will eventually receive it.

				Got it in an hour or two but the price of btc dropped so now I haven&#039;t got enough for what I wanted, ha. Hopefully SR being down doesn&#039;t cause it to drop lower.

That&#039;s the first rule of buying on SR. The prices fluctuate so much, that the price of the item you want to buy will change price in the time it takes for you to transfer the coins to your SR account. I always try for $10-20 more (you don&#039;t have to overestimate a lot, btc prices rarely rise more than a few dollars in that short of a timeframe).

				Where are you guys buying your bitcoins?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a little less than 1 BTC from some bitcoin mining I&#039;ve been doing but I&#039;d like to throw 3 or 4 more coins on top of that to have available.
