				Hey everyone I just had to write about this beyond mind blowing amazing experience I had with ForeverJung. Last Tuesday I only had .07btc left in my account and I went on for a search for something I could purchase with that. I saw that ForverJung had a listing for a sample of two Methylone capsules 175mg a piece for .04. I made the mistake of ordering the capsules and choosing the postage option &quot;free with additional purchase&quot; I contacted him a few hours later letting him know of the mistake and told him he could go ahead and cancel the order and also I had some questions regarding his ghb listing. I also shared with him that I recently ordered some completely bunk and inactive ghb from mimm. Exactly fourty five minutes later I received the most informative and personal response I&#039;ve ever received from a vendor. He sympthazied with me, he informed me about every little detail regarding his ghb but didn&#039;t make any mention on the postage mistake. The next day I saw in my account instead of canceling the order he marked it for transit. I wrote him again out of fear he made the mistake of sending it without postage being paid. Again almost immediately he wrote back said no worries! And it should be there in the next two days. He said an honest review of his product would be worth much more then the postage. Yesterday I received the package. It seemed a lot larger then necessary, I ripped it open took some time trust me but to my surprise I found two methylone pills labeled 175mg a piece and a 20ml vial of GHB!!! I can&#039;t believe my eyes. Last night I took one of the pills and keep in mind I&#039;ve done M1 a handful of times but this was the purest most intense and euphoric experience I&#039;ve ever had. The roll lasted about 3 hours extreme euphoria pupil dilation crazy and comedown was very easy! I tried the ghb a few hours ago and one thing to mention is that he liste it as 50%ghb which is very honest of him so a normal dose would be 1ml but I measures 2.5 as he advised on his vendor page. This is my first experience with ghb except from the bunk shit I got from mimm. This is what I imagined ghb would feel like. Drunk, euphoric without the dizziness. This guy is amazing and I highly highly highly recommend him 20/5. The stealth was fine for domestic, communication was amazing an the product beyond expectations!!
