				I would never recommend driving on anything, save your stash for when you get to your destination and it&#039;ll be that much more enjoyable!

				You guys got me all wrong.&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about getting smashed and jumping behind the wheel.&nbsp; I just mean something to chill out/ or focus better.&nbsp; I am an excellent driver and can handle most any drug and drive.&nbsp; Recently I was able to drive on a low dose of shrooms and it was a great experience, no problems whatsoever.&nbsp; I think meth may be a good drug in a low dose to drive on.&nbsp; Am I wrong?

				Dude, just be cautious. Any time you are on something or have contraband in your vehicle, you make any encounter with LE potentially much worse. FWIW, I thought it was a brilliant idea to go for a drive tripping on shrooms when I was a teenager and got very badly stuck in the mud at like 3AM, and had to wait till morning for a vehicle to come by and pull me out. Very embarrassing.
