				Hello SR Forum,<br /><br />Total newbie here, and as such, I didn&#039;t want to post anywhere else just yet.&nbsp; I am working on a documentary about synthetic drugs - primarily MDPV, Mephadrone, and synthetic cannabinoids - for the media outlet NBCUniversal.&nbsp; Our piece is non-judgemental and we are speaking with everyone involved: users, dealers, doctors, law enforcement, and ideally, a manufacturer.<br /><br />I understand if anyone is interested in telling their story, 100% anonymously, it will take time for trust to be established.&nbsp; We can communicate exclusively through SR private messages until you are ready to do otherwise.<br /><br />Hope to hear from someone soon.&nbsp; Please send me a private message if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />PS.&nbsp; If veteran posters would be able to provide me with info on a better place on this forum to post a request like this, it would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m brand new this seemed like the only appropriate place.

				Well the newbie section isn&#039;t exactly where all the main lab rats hang around haha.<br /><br />I would get in contact with some suppliers and sources of the product.<br /><br />That would be your best bet...

So if you want to talk to manufacturers, I think your best bet would be to go to one of the b2b markets and hit up some suppliers with a pm. I am sure that this would be a lot more successful than this place.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186570.msg1351225#msg1351225">Quote from: filetminyone on July 18, 2013, 12:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We can communicate exclusively through SR private messages until you are ready to do otherwise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This sentence seem to indicate that you hope to be able to talk to these people other than through the internet.?<br /><br />If that is the case i respectfully say: FORGET IT! If anyone would even consider this, they are not worthy of vending here, and almost deserve to get busted for their stupidity!<br /><br />I like informative documentaries (as evident by my documentaries thread), but often when i watch them i can&#039;t help wondering how profoundly stupid it is to let a journalist follow you around while you are out doing illegal shit that could get you locked up for life! That is some low hanging fruit right there...<br /><br />However i would love to see your documentary, and do hope that you are able to get in contact with some serious, and knowledgeable people, but again, i really hope that you are not going to find them here!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186570.msg1352529#msg1352529">Quote from: YourSupplierSR on July 18, 2013, 09:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m sure he&#039;s not posting outside the newbie section because he can&#039;t... how do you get the hell out of here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Getting out of the newbie section requires you to have more than 50 posts. That why you see all those spamming threads. But please don&#039;t just spam to 50 to get full access! Instead try to pass some of your knowledge on to other newbies.

				I have just one or two questions about this &quot;project&quot; .<br /><br />&nbsp;Why?<br />What for? The answer to this may be same/similar to above?????<br />Who is funding it?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Rarely as simple as it looks at first. Very few altruistic people in your chosen field? <br /><br />You will find these questions will come up many times, if you are on to the right source.
