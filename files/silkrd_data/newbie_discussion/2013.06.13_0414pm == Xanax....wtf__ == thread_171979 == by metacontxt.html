				So I&#039;m no stranger to benzos - had most of the &#039;classical&#039; benzos as well as all the z drugs...but I thought I&#039;d try some of the higher potency benzos for a laff. Got some generic Xanax from a reputable (harhar) Indian online merchant. Well they were reputable enough to send me what I paid for, so can&#039;t complain there. 1mg tabs. I heard that Xanax is around twenty times as potent as diazepam, but in the recent past I&#039;ve been able to bang down 35mg of Valium and feel nothing more than nice and floaty. 50mg puts me to sleep. So today I tried 1mg of Xanax thinking it would give a nice chill out vibe and holy shit it knocked me on my ass! I even had to have a short nap on the sofa at 7pm (!) which was about 2hrs after dropping it. Ok so next time I&#039;m going to go with 0.5mg, but what&#039;s the deal?

				xanax is used to treat panic attacks brought on by anxiety. So the idea is its supposed to work FAST like 15mins after you pop it, reach peak in short period of time, and come down pretty quick! thats why people redose well that and they forget haha Valium comes on a lot slower and last longer. i love xanax got my tolerance up to 6mgs but now im back to baseline...

				The deal is just play with that one every now and again or get ready to be buying in bulk and using all the time.&nbsp; Xanax will really grab hold of you.&nbsp; Not so much the psychological dependence but the physical dependence will force you to keep taking it.&nbsp; Seizures and all kinds of nasty effects can happen when you try to get off after using for awhile.&nbsp; And it doesn&#039;t take long to get you hooked.&nbsp; Some people who have experienced the full range of drugs (meth, heroin, etc) and had to quit those drugs claim that the withdrawals they got from those drugs weren&#039;t as bad as Xanax.&nbsp; You do what you want but if you use it just use it sparingly.&nbsp;

				Some meds if you&#039;re deficient in certain liver enzymes (I think like CP491) the meds have a much more powerful effect because the liver can&#039;t dispose of it. Or sometimes it can&#039;t break the drug into its metabolites (which might actually be the &#039;active ingredient&#039;) very fast.

				Don&#039;t worry, I know you gotta watch your benzo intake - heard lots of horror stories about people coming off them. For some long term users it takes a year or two before they&#039;re functional human beings again. Fuck that. Nah I just use benzos now and again to relax, or if I&#039;m going somewhere and I need to be able to chat easily with strangers or whatever. They&#039;re great for that. Daily use - never. That&#039;s a great way to fuck yourself up. <br /><br />I was surprised however that just one 1mg pill knocked me around so much tho...I&#039;ve had big quantities of other fast onset/short halflife benzos before and haven&#039;t ended up dozing on the couch. And I&#039;m a 95kg guy so I generally need a higher dosage than average of most meds/dope for it to take effect. Anyway, see how I go next time with 0.5mg.

				If you believe those benzo charts 1mg of Xanax is about the same as 20mg of Valium. In my experience that is about right.<br /><br />Now I have heard that the Indian pills&#039; dosages are NOT strictly regulated. I always assumed they would be less potent BUT maybe you are lucky enough to have gotten some extra potent Xannies!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Benzos aren&#039;t fun in the way ecstacy&#039;s fun...they&#039;re good for knocking back a dose, going out and being everyone&#039;s friend because the benzos have taken care of any nerves you might have otherwise experienced. You&#039;re just your smooth, social best.&nbsp; Of course if you take too much you&#039;ll be a drooling mess, and some people don&#039;t tolerate benzos and alcohol well, but once you&#039;ve figured out the right amount for you, it can be a great social help. <br /><br />Don&#039;t rely on it as a crutch whenever you need to go out, though. Only use when needed. Having a big night out with your mates? You don&#039;t need it. You&#039;ve just come home from a long day and am totally not amped up to hang out with people and you feel like you&#039;d really rather stay home....but you just gotta go. Try it.

				A low dose of benzos combined with an upper like speed - it&#039;s a nice combo. You feel amped and alert but calm. Amphetamines can be a bit full on; benzos smooth out the edginess. Great if you ever need to work a room.<br /><br />Even benzos + something like Modafinil (which isn&#039;t at all a social drug on its own) is a good cocktail for socialising in my experience.
