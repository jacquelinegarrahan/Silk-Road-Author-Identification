				&nbsp; Ok so basically my subject says it all, has anyone used coinmama before, the poetic justice of using my credit card to buy bitcoins is a hard thing for me to pass on but essentially you end up just wiring the site money via moneygram and that just seems rife with scam written all over it, however I emailed the site and they were super quick to write back and seemed somewhat solid to converse with.... the site makes my &quot;5piz3r sense&quot; tingle so I figured I would ask around and seee if anyone on SR had attempted to use the site? Thanks guys!

I don&#039;t know what it is, but something just doesn&#039;t seem right about it.<br /><br />They do seem to be attempting to build a presence over at bitcointalk.org but if it were me, I would wait a few months to see what, if anything, comes out of the woodwork here.<br /><br />Libertas

				Yeah I agree, I did a who is on the site and saw when it was created but I missed the whole isreal angle, if you attempt to use the service they ask you to send a wire to a guy in germany.... supposedly they used to accept paypal and then quit, but some underlying part of my subconcious screams scam everytime I look at there site....

				Definitely better to be safe, and hold onto your money.&nbsp; I would go to one of the more established sites if I were you.<br /><br />It smells of a bait and switch the way you describe it.&nbsp; Make a couple people happy, and then bolt with everything.
