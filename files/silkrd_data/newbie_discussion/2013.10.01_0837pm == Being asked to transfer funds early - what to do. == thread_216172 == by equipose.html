				I&#039;m kinda new, and placed my order at a pretty big vendor. (+2 years and rated 5)<br />He then tells me to release funds early as i&#039;m new and have a low transaction history.<br />I guess you can understand that i&#039;m a little uncomfortable doing that since he would be able to just scam me and say: Hey bad luck it must have been lost in the mail.<br /><br />Should i just roll with it and release the funds, or ask the vendor to cancel the order?

				Yeah i kinda get him. But as far as i&#039;m concerned the payment will eventually go through even if i just let it hang right?<br />It&#039;s a pretty small order this one, but i&#039;m looking to buy bunks if the goods are legit, i&#039;ll let the vendor know that and agree to his terms.<br /><br />Thanks for the quick answer.

				The vendor is worried that you are just a scammer as they always use new accounts as they burn their old one, and will claim the package never arrived and get a refund. My advice buy off a vendor who will let a noob stay in escrow, play the lotto games get your stats up then order and see if you can stay in escrow<br /><br />The other thing I have always done is msg the vendor before ordering to see if they are happy to do business

				when i first started here on SR almost all vendors required FE if you had less then 5 successful transactions. <br /><br />maybe buy a few books before placing your first order to get over 5 buys<br /><br /><br />much love_mcrad!

I was under the impression vendors looked at both the number of orders you&#039;ve made and the dollar amount, so 10 purchases for $15 is significantly less likely to get a vendor to trust you than 2 purchases for $70 -- just find a handful of vendors who don&#039;t require to to FE and get some drugs!

				I FE&#039;d a few times when I first joined, but I always scoured the forums for comments about the vendor first. Still, it&#039;s a risk.
