				The timing is just perfect:&nbsp; [CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion<br /><br />Someone took some time to basically duplicate SR but injected it with steroids.&nbsp; Fast, easy to use and you can get the same stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m a silk road patron but I&#039;m scratching my head right now. <br /><br />Hmmm...&nbsp; <br /><br />What do ye&#039;all think?

				That&#039;s one of the theories going around because of all the pro-Atlantis posts on here lately. No definite proof, though.

				In all honesty it seems to be true as I have seen atlantis linked to most of the forums I have been reading today. No evidence to back it up. However I am so comfortable with SR that I prefer to wait for it to come back up rather than switching to a newer site. What if their security isn&#039;t up to par? What if the whole site is a new sting op by DEA/intl DEAs, monitoring orders and vendors and just sitting back and collecting notes? What site has more experience with this market at the end of the day and who is running Atlantis? I think that most users are too comfortable with SR to even switch to Atlantis. Especially since it seems Atlantis isn&#039;t playing very nicely, if they are in fact responsible for the DDoS.

				I am almost positive it is. That was a significant exploit, it would not have been used with out the likely hood for financial gain being high and if you watched mtgox, btc prices didn&#039;t budge during the outage.

				Atlantis is well designed (obviously based on SR architecture), but the market is not very busy and the speed the site currently enjoys will disappear if they start receiving anything like the traffic SR receives.

				My name isn&#039;t Aquaman, so I don&#039;t give a fuck about Atlantis. <br /><br />If they are responsible for the attacks, I guarantee their site will go belly up within a month and the staff will be sleeping with the fishes.&nbsp; :) <br /><br /><br />3 things that point to Atlantis are...<br /><br />1. The fact nobody heard of it until SR was under attack. <br />2. All the new forum members who joined during the turmoil were<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Atlantis Supporters<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B. &quot;Hacking prodigies&quot; who claim a ddos through tor is impossible (while tor developers disagree entirely)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; C. &quot;Web Design Pros&quot; who know for a &quot;fact&quot; how SR and Atlantis are designed and knew without a doubt the shortcomings of SR coding compaired to the &quot;superiority&quot; of Atlantis coding.<br />3. When the forums started to shift towards blaming Atlantis, everything stopped.<br /><br />That alone would make anyone suspicious.
