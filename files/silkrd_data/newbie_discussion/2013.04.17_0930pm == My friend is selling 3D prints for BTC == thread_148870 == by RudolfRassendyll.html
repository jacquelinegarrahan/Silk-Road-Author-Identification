				Hello<br /><br />I have a friend who has been in the 3D printing scene for a while now. He opened up a site offering 3D prints for bitcoins and litecoins. I thought if anyone had change or any vendors had extra coin to spare they might check it out:<br />http://www.3dp4btc.com<br /><br />They will even print out bitcoins with NFC chips in them... while I&#039;m not 100% sure what this is, I think it&#039;s some kind of physical wallet. And they look sweet. And anything else you can think of too, he&#039;s printed me a bunch of little knick-knacks on visits.<br /><br />Anyways, if you wanna help good people and the bitcoin economy, while getting cool tech stuff, consider checking this out. The guy who runs the place has his mind in all the right places, although he&#039;s too paranoid to check the road out.<br /><br />Thanks

				Honestly, it really is my friend. I&#039;m not really good with tech, and it&#039;s only through the many excellent walkthroughs on these forums that I have been able to use SR at all&nbsp; :) I tried to get him to get a vendor account here, but seeing as he&#039;s selling completely legal goods that are competitively priced in the open market, I don&#039;t think he would be able to recoup the seller&#039;s account fee.... ever.<br /><br />I know he can scan people&#039;s busts and print this out as a small statue, because he did so at a local art festival last summer. So I&#039;m assuming yes, although he could have borrowed one. He is at a large university and they seem to have more of a sense of community ownership with all their tech toys. However, I&#039;d guess this isn&#039;t part of his services provided via the listed url, unless you were willing to drive to his location or send your 3D scanned bust over the net. But I doubt SR pplz are looking to send a profile over the web or have themselves scanned in anyways&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Can you tell me what a bitcoin with an NFC chip in it would be? Is it like a physical wallet, or am I way off?
