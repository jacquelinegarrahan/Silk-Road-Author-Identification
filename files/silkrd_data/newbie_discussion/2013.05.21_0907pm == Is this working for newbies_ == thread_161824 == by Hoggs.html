				Maybe it depends on what you&#039;re selling or you&#039;re not getting yourself known.. You should have a forum presence and things would be better then

				you dont have your vendor page in your forum profile.<br />Adding that and getting into the 50+ msg count and then making a review thread of your vendor would help.

				There are a few things that you could improve to have buyers... First of all, Canada isn&#039;t a huge market and I&#039;d recommend doing Canada and US. You also don&#039;t specify how you ship it, which is really important for weed. You should say if you vacuum seal it, or use MBB (MBB recommended) for example. You should also show pictures of your actual product and not just plant products, have amounts in listings name like &quot;7 grams of medical grade xxx&quot;, and have longer descriptions, like what the high, taste, etc. is like. <br />And finally, your listings are all for big amounts and not everybody is ready to pay $200 on a completely new vendor. Try to make listings for a couple grams for people to know what your stuff is like, and do some advertising on the forums!

				I&#039;d venture to guess most people are skeptical of buying from someone with little to no feedback simply for the sake of safety. Anyone can end up with a vendor account, be it LE or just a scammer. I know I always sort by &quot;best selling&quot; so I can look at feedback and see how long they&#039;ve been selling and how many transactions they&#039;ve had. It&#039;s all about promoting yourself, which is why a lot of vendors do samples. Luckily for the SR community, there are individuals that risk their own safety for the benefit of the SR community.

				Get up to 50 posts.<br /><br />Get a thread put up in the Rumour mill<br /><br />Offer some very cheap/free samples<br /><br />Offer 1 gram, 2 gram 5 gram amounts<br /><br /><br />Someone will bite eventually if you give them a chance to try your stuff without much risk.
