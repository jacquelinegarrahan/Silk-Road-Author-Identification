				I am thinking of moving in to the more bulk side of sales - who would be interested in the prices listed on the title?<br />The coke would be medium heat - better than street quality.<br />Basically I sell it locally and never have any complaints.<br />If this price point would appeal to you - let me know via my vendor acct and we can work something out.<br />If you&#039;re interested in even more bulk than 1 ounce - price can be negotiated.<br />Thanks!

				Hey mate what&#039;s your success rate like shipping to Australia? Regular bulk is something I&#039;m definitely looking for if you can get it through our customs. I would even be willing to pay extra for super-secure stealth packaging if you had that option.

				1500 for an oz of blow, a bit high man.&nbsp; Seriously, as far as oz&#039;s go, an even 1,000 is fair.&nbsp; 28 grams of good blow, I&#039;d have to move more than half of it without cutting it.&nbsp; at 200 for a ball, 5 balls equals the grand, that leaves me three balls to play and party with.&nbsp; At 1500 for the oz, that would leave hardly anything for wiggle room.&nbsp; Set up a vendor account and sell half grams or grams as a taste, see what happens.&nbsp; Just thinking out loud

				1500 seems very high for an ounce of blow...&nbsp; There&#039;s no profit margin there and I doubt many are buying ounces for personal use.

				I would pay no more than 12 an o for blow. 1500 is kind of ridiculously high.<br />Currently, I get ounces for 900. If you can compete with that with a good product,<br />I would definitely be interested.

				Yeah 12 was kind of my limit too, but 150 for a ball when you&#039;re buying that quantity is still kind of ridiculous.

				I just saw another of your posts and that said 2000 for the cock and not sure about the meth but I did just read one of your posts samgiananca or whatever and it clearly states 2000 for an oz of cock so whats the big change all of a sudden smells fishy to me and no i&#039;m not talking about your so called fish scale if I don&#039;t get an answer from you well need I say more cheers

				2000?!?&nbsp; That&#039;s ludicrous.&nbsp; Maybe OP realized he&#039;d never generate any business with $2000 zips?

				Unless you are getting the coke from Escabars kitchen, then nobody is going to pay that price, man.

				I myself would be very weary ordering such large ammounts.<br /><br />A man in my country has just been busted ordering a large ammount of weed. over 200 grams. Although im not aware of the exact circumstances involving the bust. I would not want to appear as though im attempting to traffic. If I get busted with anything I would want it to be light enough that I would not appear as though im attempting to traffic.<br /><br />Try and avoid using your real name. Send a test letter to make sure your particular postal situation would allow such a name to be delivered to the chosen address.<br /><br />Good Luck everyone.
