				I&#039;m new to the forums, but I&#039;ve been lurking SR for a while and been considering buying some drugs for the past year or so.<br /><br />I mostly understand SR and Bitcoin&#039;s workings, but could someone explain Bitcoin transactions/deposits/escrows and such?<br />What Bitcoin sites do you guys recommend? I&#039;ve heard MtGox may block users if they use Tor.<br /><br />Also, about cannabis. I&#039;m pretty new to this, but my sister&#039;s boyfriend has been smoking for a long time.<br />This will probably be the first time I ever try cannabis and I&#039;ve been wanting to for years. What strains do you guys recommend?<br />

				I&#039;ve been here for a long time but just started vending need to get my post count up so i&#039;ll answer. Escrow works exactly how it sounds your money gets put into usd and once you clear funds they are converted back to btc and sent to the vendor. If you dispute it varies sometimes a reship sometimes %50 back sometimes nothing. Depends on your reputation and whatever social contract you entered with the vendor.<br /><br />Stay the fuck away from mtgox. It is a waste of time first off and with what they are doing to US acct&#039;s I wouldn&#039;t even fuck with it. For US bank deposit I&#039;d recommend Bitcopia. Even during the bubble they were extremely fast and well priced for speed.

				For bitcoins maybe look around for Blue Sky Traders, they seem to get good reviews and have a fee of maybe 4% on cash deposits iirc. If you need it fast, Moneypak works well but you have to find a reputable vendor here to exchange it to BTC into your account.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177080.msg1273465#msg1273465">Quote from: DaringBlowfish on June 25, 2013, 05:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, about cannabis.

What strains do you guys recommend?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would say look for a strain that is maybe no more than 50% sativa, especially if it&#039;s your first time. This cannabis on SR, at least the top grade organic medical AAA+++ stuff, well, I cannot believe how powerful it is. I need probably 1/4 or less the amount I used to smoke from stuff bought locally maybe 10-15 years ago. So I would say also take it easy on your first smoke. I&#039;m talking like one small toke and then wait at least 5 minutes before going again. <br /><br />Sometimes with these strong strains, especially the sativa dominant ones, if you&#039;ve not smoked ever or in a long time, it can give you a bit of anxiety or panic. So that&#039;s why I recommend starting slow. Once you&#039;ve eased into it for a few sessions you can take more. It&#039;s just the mind has to relax and realize there is no reason to panic. Then it&#039;s all good and smooth sailing. It also helps to have some stuff laid out ahead of time that you want to do, like watch a funny movie, have some drinks or snacks all laid out. Because once you&#039;re super high you can still do all that stuff but it&#039;s much more of a pain.

I was here shortly on the site a year ago or so, but never actually came back until now. It was always on my mind though.<br /><br />@gooddrugmafia &amp; mcguire39: Thank you for your advice, fellas. I&#039;ll be sure to stay the fuck away from MtGox, and I&#039;ll take the sativa content into mind when buying. I think I do need anything to help me relax, but a little stressed lately, heh.<br /><br />Also, anybody to offer advice on LSD and magic mushrooms?
