				I wanted know if anyone on SR has heard of a buyer getting busted?&nbsp; For example, DEA or LE sets up as a vendor, and sends out packages and busts people upon arrival of merchandise?

				Good Question. but the interstate or international coordination that would take is huge. the time line for delivery in the us is typically less than 10 days. plus you have to involve the feds too with the postal inspectors. so many layers. our local LE has trouble stopping speeders let alone coordinating multi level reverse stings. in my opinion, very unlikely.

				I&#039;m interested too; I am not sure if this would be entrapment because they are soliciting? But then again, shows like &quot;to catch a predator&quot; have them pretending to be girls etc.

				Thanks for responding, I didn&#039;t know it took so much effort.&nbsp; Also, I would think they would spend effort and money on a dealer/vendor.&nbsp; Not as much as a small time buyer?&nbsp; Entrapment is interesting, and I know if you ask a LE/DEA are you a narcotics officer of any kind prior to buying on the streets, and they lie and answer &quot;no&quot;, that is not considered entrapment?&nbsp;

				Some people watch too much TV.&nbsp; It is fucked up, but cops don&#039;t have to tell you that they are cops, they can lie.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you lie to them, n ow that is a crime.

				LE can&#039;t send you illegal substances. The best they can do is intercept an order and facilitate a controlled delivery.<br /><br />LE are here, no doubt. But as far as LE setting up a vendor&#039;s account and actually sending you goods? Not a chance. It&#039;s soliciting.

				you can find some story over the clearnet, usually they didn&#039;t use good practice to buy or bought too much.<br /><br />If you buy 1kg of weed via mail, probably you get problems :D

				it can happen on to fronts. The one you stated that LE goes to your specif vendor busts him and decides to do a CD or controlled delivery. Which i don&#039;t think would happen&nbsp; because basically the LE will be doing the job of the vendor packing them up and shipping them out to you. The more likely thing that COULD happen is you have a controlled delivery. meaning some undercover prick is bringin you the mail to sign so dont sign unless its your good old mailman! especially dont sign if it said on the vendor page I do no require a signature .

				yah they wouldnt even have to send you the drugs. you would order them and they would do a CD. anyways i could never see them doing that. its way to much work and they know hardly anyone would accept the delivery. i have no doubt LE are here because ive seen it on the news and papers and LE said they were here. there not just going to turn a blind eye. right now theres not much they can do. but i have no doubt there all over tor, not just SR. they are probably set up as exit nodes as well.
