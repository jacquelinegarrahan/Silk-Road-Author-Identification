				Some vendors require it, but there are other methods to communicating.<br /><br />The top 3 are:<br />Plain text<br />PGP<br />Privnote<br /><br />I personally recommend PGP, from what I can tell it&#039;s the most secure of the 3 options.<br /><br />Generally speaking PGP is mainly used for sensitive information you&#039;d rather not have just out in the open, IE: any information that would lead back to you (address, phone number, etc.)

				I haven&#039;t made my first purchase yet, but my plan was to send it under a fake name (for which I&#039;ve set up a mobile phone number and email address (Hotmail)) and send it to a friends address (who has agreed to this).<br /><br />They live at a rental property and if it&#039;s under a fake name this shouldn&#039;t put my friend at risk, especially if they keep the package there for a few days just in case they&#039;re raided or questioned by LE (which is unlikely because I plan to encrypt the name and address) - they could just claim that they were going to give it back to the post office because it&#039;s not in their name/it could be a previous addressee of the rental property.

Probably unlikely, but just something to consider.
