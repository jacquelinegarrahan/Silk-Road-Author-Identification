				Use SR, much easier to not get scammed. As far as I know, only way to get scammed is through FE&#039;ing orders and the person doesn&#039;t ship product. Just never FE.

				dude. only use silk road, they have an ESCROW system, which means when you buy something the money goes into a pool where neither you nor the seller can access it until its delivered and YOU confirm that you recieved it, but if you lie and say you didnt get it, you will become blacklisted and people will fuck you up

				Dude about 6 months ago I almost ordered from them because their prices looked fucking amazing. HOWEVER I did some research here in the forums and realized they had been hacked. Sorry you got ripped off. What were you looking for? Maybe we can direct you to some reliable vendors. PM if you want.<br /><br />Ryno

				I have been scammed a few times in the road myself... Mostly at times like now, when there is little coin available to the masses, and people are forced to buy from vendors.. I would never trust another site. I used BMR once... It was only some research chems though..
