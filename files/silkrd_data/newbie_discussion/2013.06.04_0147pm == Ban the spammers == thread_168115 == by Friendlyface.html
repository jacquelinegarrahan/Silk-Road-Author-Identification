				I don&#039;t get why this site permits these spammers to stay here. I have been here for weeks, and this is my first post.<br /><br />I really appreciate the admin creating this site. I consider myself lucky to be a part of this wonderful community.<br /><br />Good luck, and best wishes to everybody here.

				This latest little fucker sent me a PM. Whoever it is can&#039;t possibly think someone is going to respond. It&#039;s probably just some hater trying to vandalize the site. But, it&#039;s just something we have to deal with if we want to maintain anonymity, and they know it.

				And how do you ban an user in an anonymous circuit as ToR?<br /><br />The accounts are obviously always banned, but he can simply create others. Without a global reference (as it can be an IP) to reference an user how can you ban him/her? If one is at least a little literate in computers it is almost impossible to ban an user even in clearnet forums, how do you expect it can be even minimally possible here?<br /><br />The onion is built primarily for anonymity and this has great advantages but it brings with itself naturally also disadvantages. Still the advantages for what it concerns us clearly outweighs the inconveniences (as spamming).<br /><br />Think about it for a second.

				Oh that sucks never thought of that however not sure if this is possible but I know on sites like Twitter the system will not allow you to post duplicate post. If you do try and post a duplicate (something you&#039;ve already posted before) it just kicks the post back to you. I wonder how possible it would be to do on here? <br /><br />The programming can&#039;t be that hard for something like that. That would solve the problem at least with the duplicate posts and you wouldn&#039;t have to ban any users???<br /><br />Just a possible suggestion cause this is definitely a problem on here.

				Look here is the problem and first let me say I know your doing what you can to combat the problem here. The Newbie forum is where all the new users go to get information. Mostly important, information that helps the newbie to remain safe and to remain anonymous as well as to avoid being scammed.<br /><br />The Newbie forum is probably by far the worst place for this spamming to happen because when you compare a newbie to the other more experinced users they really know very little and need this help.They need a safe place to be able to go ask questions, exchange ideas, and to get this advice.<br /><br />
