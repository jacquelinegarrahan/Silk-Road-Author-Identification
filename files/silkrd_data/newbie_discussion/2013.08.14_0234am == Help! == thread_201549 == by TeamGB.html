				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re an active vendor just sell the minimum amount of items needed to get your bond back. If you have regular customers with a good relationship just ask them if you can create them custom orders on the other vendor account.

				I&#039;m on your back because I hate scammers and this smells suspiciously like one to me.&nbsp; At the very least there is a chance the account could be banned if my previous statement is true and then the buyer is shit out of luck because of your carelessness.

				Alright I lied.&nbsp; One last rant.&nbsp; What I meant was there is a chance you though you could list and sell to yourself until you had enough transactions to get your bond back thus bypassing the bond system.&nbsp; If this was less than the amount paid it would be worth it for you.&nbsp; Plus, how is full escrow offered if you are selling the listing from the account you are selling?&nbsp; If you transfer passwords, the buyer can login, empty the coins, and change the password.&nbsp; If you make them finalize first, the chance of not passing the account over is absolutely possible.&nbsp; It seems like this is an account you won&#039;t be using so who cares if it has bad feedback from false transactions or scammed people?

				Ill just make a listing with the account on it for the price they decide on. They choose to pay and I send all the passwords, send over my btc to another account and logout of that one. Then the buyer will change all of the Passwords and Pins.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t understand the rest of what you said.
