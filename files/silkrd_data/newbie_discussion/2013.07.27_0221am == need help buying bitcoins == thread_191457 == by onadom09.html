				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				very nice guide medicinewoman :)&nbsp; but i agree localbitcoins.com is probably the best and safest.&nbsp; just keep looking for vendors who accept a payment option that works best for you.&nbsp; if you head to the site it&#039;s pretty self expalnatory but if you need more details just click on my SN by my avatar and go to my profile and select see posts and i swear the last 6 posts i&#039;ve made have been a step by step process for localbitcoins.&nbsp; Also welcome to the silkroad :)&nbsp; don&#039;t ever apologize for being a newb.&nbsp; Too many people here forget what it was like when they first came here and everyone treated them like shit.&nbsp; Keep asking questions and i&#039;ll do my best to help.&nbsp; Newbs can&#039;t grow up unless someone is willing to teach them the ropes.&nbsp; hope that helped!
