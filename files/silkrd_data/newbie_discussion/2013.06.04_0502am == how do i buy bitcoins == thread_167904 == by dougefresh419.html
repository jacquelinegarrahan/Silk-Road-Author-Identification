				im also curious about this and would like to hear answers from more experienced users.<br /><br />.....But from what I understand its very simple. All you have to do is go onto bitinstant.com..click cash deposit (from say walmart i hear is a good place) -&gt;&gt; deposit to *bitcoin address. You can find your SR bitcoin address by clicking account and then clicking &#039;make a deposit&#039;. Then you simply follow the steps on bitinstant. Print the slip. Take it to walmart and give them cash. 30 minutes to an hour later you should have bit coins on your SR account. Also use a fake name, address, number and Tor email when you do all this. They shouldnt ask for i.d.&nbsp; If they do ask for i.d go somewhere else. <br /><br />Thats just my thoughts though and what iv come to understand. I haven&#039;t actually purchased any bitcoins myself yet. If im wrong and there is a better method someone please correct me

				If you&#039;re in the US, the simplest way to buy BTC is to use Coinbase since it accepts bank transfers and debit cards without a long wait like mtgox.&nbsp; However, it is not very anonymous.<br /><br />mindlessWarrior mentions Bitinstant.&nbsp; Do not buy BTC with bitinstant.&nbsp; Instead use their service (if you choose to) to transfer USD to mtgox or another exchange and buy the BTC yourself.&nbsp; Bitinstant capitalizes on spread and will get you a bad price.&nbsp; Also, if you do choose to buy BTC with bitinstant do not send the BTC directly to a SR address.<br /><br />Bitcoins are not anonymous if an address can be tied to you.<br /><br />Using IRC and out of band transfers is worth it (for anonymity) and relatively safe if you go about it correctly and carefully.&nbsp; Even buying locally from someone is probably better than having official records on your transactions and video footage of you sending money at Walmart or equivalent.<br /><br />Look into mixing services.&nbsp; There are some reputable ones with zero or close to no fees.<br /><br />Mining is also a good way to generate BTC anonymously.<br />

Would that be a good secure way? <br />and what do you mean bitinstand gets a bad price for you......gah im so confused lol

				i swear learning pgp is 100times easier then figuring out how to safely buy a bitcoin. Just because there are soooo many methods. Cant one person just be like. Hey this is the best method to buy a bitcoin. Everyone do it. Or else.<br /><br />And lets be honest..the SR wiki on buying BTC doesnt help at all. It merely points you in the direction

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
