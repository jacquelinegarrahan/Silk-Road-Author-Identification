				Hi everybody.<br /><br />I came onto silkroad the other day and a pleasant but disconcerting surprise met my eyes. I have 800 dollars in my account that I did not put there! I&#039;m pretty sure it can&#039;t be due to a rise in value of bitcoin, since I had about 50 dollars on before. My only concern is that this is due to a bug in the bitcoin system and that this money may screw up some how if I try to buy something. I remember that something happened back in may that caused a split in the logs, but I don&#039;t know how to figure out if that happened. Since I haven&#039;t been on SR for a few months, my account history has been deleted so I can&#039;t see if I was given money by someone else.<br /><br />Cheers to the helpful!

				Send some this way!<br /><br />Lucky as the Devil. Why these things never (I say NEVER) happen to me?<br /><br />Consider a little donation for the poor (i.e. me)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Aside jokes (not so much though, I mean, I&#039;m really poor and a donation would be handy... ok, ok I stop I promise) even if it is an error you will probably never find from where they come, and if someone after this post will come saying that the money is theirs I would require some VERY hard proof of that.<br /><br />As for the doubt you have, I really don&#039;t think you have nothing to worry about, those money are there to stay&nbsp; (until something &quot;magically&quot; returns to normal in case of some error somewhere and just for this I would suggest you to spend the more you can as fast as you can, as in... donating something to the poor!... ok ok, I said I did stop, but it&#039;s too much of an effort&nbsp; :P)<br /><br />EDIT: As a last thing,<br /><br />Watch these words... 10 you are feeling your eyes heavy, 9, 8, they are heavier every moment it passes, 7, heavier and heavier...&nbsp; 6, 5, 4, now you feel like you want to sleep, it&#039;s so relaxing and easy, isn&#039;t it? 3, 2, 1You are completely relaxed and asleep, 0 you are asleep, completely asleep.<br /><br />Donate to BlackIris, donate to BlackIris, donate to BlackIris. After you will wake you will have a GREAT an insurmountable urge to donate to BlackIris, remember the name: BlackIris.<br /><br />Now I will count till 10 and you will feel well and relaxed, well and relaxed; 10, 9, you are going to wake up, 8, 7, 6 well and relaxed, well and relaxed, 5, 4, 3, you are going up and up and waking more and more, 2, 1 you are almost here, 0, you are fully awake.<br /><br />Now, didn&#039;t you need to do something urgently? 8)<br /><br />

				If this is true, you need to report it to SR before you make purchases with it just in case this is a glitch like it was the last time (which they will discover and reverse whether or not you tell them now).

				haha so you created an account just to say you found free money, dont respond, or create a support thread? I would withdraw to see if the transaction really goes through, so if its a glitch no one else gets involved. Prob just a bad troll post.
