I can&#039;t point fingers because it&#039;s impossible to know who gives anyone karma, nor can I imagine why they would bother doing this, but each to their own!<br /><br />Forum moderators have the ability to give out karma as much as they wish but none of us are going to be giving any karma at all, positive or negative, as of our new policy implemented yesterday.<br /><br />Libertas

				Most of us who have been experiencing this for some time learn to ignore it, but I&#039;m pretty sure the person doing this picks random newbs or new people to attack because they will start a new thread, bringing attention to it again. It&#039;s the psychology of the school bully, they do it as long as they get a reaction. If nobody responded, they would stop. It wouldn&#039;t be fun anymore.<br /><br />For now, they&#039;re getting a kick out of it.<br />
