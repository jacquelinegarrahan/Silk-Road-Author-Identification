				I am also sort of just starting out but I&#039;ve been &quot;just starting&quot; for the past 3 weeks so I&#039;m where you at just a little more understanding I guess. I&#039;d be happy to explain to you what I&#039;ve used up to this point.

I am ready to purchase tomorrow.<br /><br />Thx !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sadly you will not be able to make a purchase tomorrow.<br />But here is the answers you will be looking for.<br />To change your money into bitcoins you will need a bank account.<br />If you have a bank account you will need to know your account number and the line of numbers that show up on the bottom of a check.&nbsp; You know the ones I&#039;m<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;talking about.<br /><br />Next you will go to coinbase.com <br />Obviously you will be creating an account with them. <br />To be able to buy the bitcoins from this service you will then need to link your bank account with them. (This is where the account number and check number<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will come into play)<br /><br />I know you will want to just be able to use your debit card to buy bitcoins but that&#039;s just not gunna happen.<br />Once you have this information filled out, the verification process will take about 5 days. <br />In my case coinbase.com had to take an extra precautionary measure and put a small amount of money into my bank account and I then had to tell them the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;amount they put in. I go into such detail about this as a way to enforce the security that this place has to ease any worries you might have about giving <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;away so much confidential information.<br /><br />Once all the bank information has been verified with coinbase you are now able to purchase your first bitcoin!<br />As I type this one bitcoin has risen to about 100 dollars. (american)<br />A little tip that I suggest is in your sr setting change the currency to show the dollar amount at the begging for a better perspective on the &quot;real world prices.&quot;<br /><br />It will take 3 or so days for the order to be processed for your coin.<br />Once the coin has arrived in your coinbase.com account you will need to transfer that over to silkroad.<br />To do so send your money to your specialized bitcoin silkroad address. <br />To see it you will go to your account then&nbsp; the click here to make a deposit button.<br />It will then show you your bitcoin address!<br />Now go back over to coinbase.com and send your money over.<br /><br />You make think that you are now ready to make your fist purchase on silkroad.<br />I&#039;m sorry but not quite yet.<br /><br />This thing we&#039;re doing isn&#039;t some amazon one click buy type of shit.<br />You are going to need to actually communicate with the vendors.<br />It&#039;s easy to disassociate yourself from the idea behind those usernames you see are actual people.<br />And like you they want their transactions to be as safe as possible to not get thrown in jail.<br /><br />You will need to learn to encrypt and decrypt messages.<br />To do so you&#039;re going to need a few applications.<br />I&#039;ll just start by saying I&#039;m on a mac:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GPG (https://gpgtools.org/installer/index.html)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Textmate (http://macromates.com/download)<br /><br />The GPG will basically be used as an address keeper.<br />Textmate will be used to make and decrypt messages.<br />Now you may think this all seems a little over the top and not necessary for you to learn but the fact is no one will do business with you if you&#039;re not encrypting <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your messages so fucking learn this.<br /><br />Before you make your first purchase you really need to practice sending and receiving these encrypted messages.<br />You don&#039;t want to make an ass out of yourself infront of these cool drug dealer guys by sending a fucked up email that he can&#039;t read.<br /><br />In GPG create a new key. You can use any email and name you want it doesn&#039;t matter.<br />The messages you receive or send or whatever will not show up at that place.<br />I suggest using your real name and an email that relates to your silkroad username.<br />You&#039;ll then choose a secret passphrase. This passphrase will be used later on so don&#039;t forget it.<br /><br />To use textmate efficiently you are going to need to change the settings<br />on your mac.<br />Go to settings and then go to the keyboard options.<br />In the left column on the keyboard options you&#039;re gunna go to the services.<br />If you scroll down far enough you will eventually see the boxes for the GPG settings. Select all of those.<br /><br />Now that we&#039;re done setting this up it&#039;s now time to put it in action.<br /><br />We&#039;ll start by setting up your first address in your GPG keychain.<br />For example I&#039;ll use Scout who&#039;s a pretty big deal in the sr forum world.<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />mQENBFDyZ9cBCAC8u36Z9K/iqJRy2oCIL0ObS0dEQqCd4k/WgBooTRAleCPgAVH8<br />XUPJfvGNFxkJsiLcIwk8YUfEE1/hn3IQIvsoe0qDQSJ5+t7GE/RoEqd3UJUXFZf+<br />NxSSHkvE/yG2IB9oIJJ7UCsqQ/FG/QceLbqesNboH0eNG4JGWY4ottGqMuBeQMFu<br />XQP/Ata25o5EqIRIZKlLxMHbGfXFrd3CNPA8cJcmxE1aH4ZkOVqLFZBsYuRmex+i<br />ForaiTsq9geGZHlYZBqqWH/uPr0cYXRu3NLqLfkYjvG3I83PYxH/dgcLQmWT9C2/<br />S38YStJKmHrsQzVRdBJor/g/qf8IrSG0JKx1ABEBAAG0GXNjb3V0IDxzYzB1dEB0<br />b3JtYWlsLm9yZz6JAT8EEwECACkFAlDyZ9cCGy8FCQeEzgAHCwkIBwMCAQYVCAIJ<br />CgsEFgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRBQNeWC2yFZt8lWB/0fkjzf/3oWSIfZH7AXfBcjx2Tz<br />QpI7uRZbQseck8W/eGikQqJ1N0Pzw40O1kPgozzrCMrLirphT8rGhpw8RzqQu+pp<br />BBfeZIwg2kRNUfJdTZ/L2wnq0X5LSO682BAmzX5k4Tt75aBc3jnq45xVx9B0c7DL<br />kAXw7uroxmYWLEj5jUmB4tHpRxzgvNXmKBvR8jC7LNFEFawBHUtFTPDsjqEFed8s<br />fLqbmz9Jd7Of2CcFwvIaLxu588RO70zuCwdJWflxTSapIjTyZdfeo5Kt+pNJXQJE<br />gZx2BHOq9PlYTOLf6QehLLWa7Gp7PvgmV4z5xKhP+luPOK8uugamySMgX/jKuQEN<br />BFDyZ9cBCADPBZhvoV3MZL0Tjn5nixz1TQbw8Gp8uA25FCAPkRPv5YE5cBPjZgon<br />fkDZcGJ/kz47OSe+CLps6sTxRYV6rTMS3JAGFmEJX4Il/zzWXNC5h65vxxgI+gf+<br />iBynIW2IG/4/hBv6NJEx2mEpTyxvrfzy+NtCADBQSf9m+20LszM2EvzTtqh5uQwr<br />CJ+2R0yabOYJpuHbHtlS40TsdyvbATThXFoOxGVmOV6D40Yl254JfxDsO9dc8yLv<br />JNRz/fbIetJuBxAyW1Q2cq1siShxMyAFrugoKiTRAozHYFe6vM97Td4cV1FNjJXn<br />FBZwzVETAIQQAWdR6zrNsbvKJEPfgXtfABEBAAGJAkQEGAECAA8FAlDyZ9cCGy4F<br />CQeEzgABKQkQUDXlgtshWbfAXSAEGQECAAYFAlDyZ9cACgkQSBRDI3bw2sqb7Qf/<br />RRQv/FUR4t6i7vPtjozVQO1EjjebwpaeppqPczNA3oU9jwhE451EOxH2Kbxzt/ME<br />lupntH7pD/DrVvYmEv6JwIRWwzuTIIL+CpXtj4HWDtK27ZqEs6qCWH9d5SzizowS<br />3Wz4knrQTPQHYqoXtbParbrufBnW7EkiQNRW6AySF+VpA79PzOQtND+cCSebEFpB<br />O7+b5e6uOr/wBafiUH3isatrvcIBg4km3NSF7prj0m+0n0pENP1KNfTrPlBb0oRP<br />tf29MY/3UmlA8By84XaGOU0QQIGytaosxw5P+GYpa6mVlCTn1usXWv//YY6noJfx<br />15F+e4rYhXzW2Qx7xorpZ+doCACb/emVZsPmI/r4uwvM28l9E3YHJvh4lG4pwarc<br />dfvvAbPn1fHhsBUv4tl378Wc7tt7gL+nuXdPZGRBUdoF3ET8ZrKk254Ed92B0yVz<br />aO4omGpV2LgkGTBa7Og0H+NnHsU+b2axyqCJRiQ4KSYdAewDpMNAij8oqO0fnEIj<br />kqlt96mU1rp1/qABCGpRLHyA8GaD614lB2spOiMs4sczpinwDfu2VWuUNHps2U/S<br />W/8kWSopw5Xv37hYlhsuIWpTxO/J5Cuswniz4iSbROCrSSi9PKVWnQ+ZYMtkDoqt<br />lpo9Y+s/1SoYBfB0WMBC44N5jLVcuy+ezoC/lm6R9n8wtmCu<br />=blbb<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />You will highlight everything from the first set of ----&#039;s to the last set of ----&#039;s nothing before nothing after.<br />Copy this and bring it over to text mate.<br />Select the whole thing obviously and right click and choose services.<br />Click on &quot;Import Key From Selection&quot;<br /><br />This is what we call a public key.
