				I have a payment slip that is not yet expired but correlated with a previous SR wallet address. I wasnt going to use that payment slip and got a new address to create a new transaction.&nbsp; My question is will my old SR wallet address still work if I make the payment even though I have a new address? (If that makes sense)

				Since Bitinstant changed, I want go ahead and use my existing, unexpired payment slip, (instead of creating a new one), but it is correlated with my old SR wallet address. Will the bitcoins still be transferred into my SR account, or do I essentially have to create a new transaction altogether because of the new wallet address?? If anyone can help, I would appreciate it a bunch... Thanks!

				Yeah I went to Bitinstant to do just that, but now you have to create an account instead of make the transaction as a guest. Then they have to verify identity, etc. Didnt like how that changed so I wasnt sure if I could use that existing slip I had made with old wallet address. I could just go through other avenues to get coins, but I thought I would try to use this slip I have first.. Thanks for the reply! If anyone else knows any info on this matter, it would be much appreciated

				Yes sir all old addresses will work with your account&#039;s wallet.<br /><br />You really didn&#039;t think silk road would just keep the money sent to old addresses, did you? :P<br /><br />I still recommend getting a brand new one for every transaction.<br /><br />I also recommend not hooking it up to bitinstant unless you are using fake info.
