				I want out of the noob zone but don&#039;t want to waste time doing it. Preferably a reputable forum member or mod. If a mod can bring me out of noob status without needing to spam, I&#039;ll pay for that too. Otherwise, I&#039;ll give you my temp password.

				I dont blame him, ive been a member long before that was employed, but i made an account for a friend the other night, and spammed to 100 for him, I have a lightning fast connection with TOR for some reason, mist of the time anyway. <br /><br />It is a serious cunt, the spam rule and captchas....but well worth it for the filtering of dirtbags it provides. <br /><br />&nbsp;
