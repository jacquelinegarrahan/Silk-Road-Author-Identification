				Yes of course, we offer worldwide shipment. But we have to say that we don&#039;t offer refunds for overseas shipments.<br />It&#039;s because overseas letters can be easily lost on way even if it doesn&#039;t contain illegal substances, there&#039;s too much risk for us to offer refunds for shipments to usa or countries like this.<br />We offer 50-70% refund for shipments within European Union.<br />We checked our method with a friends from countries: UK, France, Sweden, Slovakia, Poland, Portugal and of course domestic shipment to Germany and succesful rate was 100%.<br />More about us you can read at our vendor page.
