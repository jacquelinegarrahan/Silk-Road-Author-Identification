				OK, I gave these vendors a chance to make right these fucked up situations before calling them out publicly.&nbsp; I was direct, courteous, and more than fair in trying to seek resolution with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;So all that is left to do for me is try and help others avoid this garbage.&nbsp; <br /><br />TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, as I did, to test what you buy if you care at all about what you&#039;re putting in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;AND I IMPLORE YOU, DO NOT just take my word for it here.&nbsp; In fact, do not take anyone&#039;s word without a grain of salt.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am sure these vendors will come on with their shill forum accounts and try to discredit me.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine, because I am only here to encourage people to test what they buy, and if these vendors stop selling shit that&#039;s cut with meth, then everyone wins.&nbsp; If someone else says they tested something and it came up clean, you have to decide for yourself whether or not you believe they are telling the truth or are who they say they are.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody besides yourself can ensure what you have is not deadly, especially not these particular vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal responsibility is the ethos here afterall.<br /><br />I bought from these guys because they have been around for a while and because they&#039;ve gotten at least some praise.&nbsp; From now on I&#039;m just going to warn vendors ahead of time that I will be testing their product and not to bother sending me product if there is a chance it&#039;s going to turn up positive for methamphetamine cut.<br /><br /><br />*********** WARNING -- GODOFALL ************<br /><br />godofall , officially blacklisted for selling cocaine cut with methamphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Great customer service right up until the point where I had a problem, sadly.&nbsp; Then he simply ignored my messages.&nbsp; This was 3.5g of his &quot;acetone washed&quot; new stuff -- $480 for an 8ball of the&nbsp; &quot;more mellow high&quot; (I guess he meant mellow compared to straight meth because this stuff was not mellow at all) -- this is the stuff he apparently spent 2 months trying to find after a long string of very bad quality coke began to deteriorate his reputation.&nbsp; I guess he couldn&#039;t and decided to settle for dirty coke.<br /><br />The worst part is I initially brought my water test results to him, saying I was surprised to see what looked like about 10% of the cocaine not dissolving.&nbsp; He responded and said his test showed the same thing and that he was OK with me publishing my review.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty honest.&nbsp; I think this also shows he was unaware it was cut with meth otherwise I don&#039;t think he would have been OK with it.&nbsp; Then the next day, he advertised his coke on the forums saying it was his best and had little or even &quot;possibly no cuts at all&quot; in it!&nbsp; Funny... I wonder how it went from definitely having cuts, confirmed by goa himself, to &quot;possibly having no cuts at all&quot; in just a day&#039;s time. <br /><br />Next up...<br /><br />************ WARNING -- RAILS ***************<br /><br />RAILS, officially blacklisted for selling cocaine cut with methamphetamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rails at least responded to my messages, but that&#039;s most I got from him.&nbsp; Here is how that conversation went:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Rails,<br /><br />I have some unfortunate news to bring you. What you sent me ([tx id removed], 3.5g cola) was tested and found to be cut with an unknown quantity of methamphetamine. And not for nothing, this is the second out of the last three orders I&#039;ve made on SR from different cola vendors with the same problem. The test was done using Marquis, Mecke, Mandelin, and Simon reagents and verified by a well-known harm reduction organization.<br /><br />I would like a partial refund for this -- I think 50% would be reasonable at minimum -- as this is an absolutely *unacceptable* and dangerous cut to find in cocaine. In all honesty a full refund would be the appropriate way to address this since reagent testing kits are cheap, easily available, and so there really is no excuse for this lack of quality control.<br /><br />I am open to discussing it more with you but ultimately this needs to be made right. I hope you understand the severity of this issue.<br /><br />Please get back to me as soon as possible.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To which I get this rather rude response:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Show me proof of your accusations and I will give you a full refund. Obviously it would be impossible for you to prove this to us so no proof = no refund. With that said I like keeping my clients happy. I will send you a gram of my new batch free of charge because you are unhappy. This is in no way us giving in to what you are accusing us of which in my opinion is a pile of shit because are stuff is tested. &quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I responded again and kindly asked for a 50% refund, as well as requested that he talk to me like an adult, and that I didn&#039;t want another gram, but I was again met with a brick wall response. <br /><br />What great customer service! &gt;.&gt; I have perfect buyer stats and with over $3000 in transactions from ~15 different vendors over several months, so yeah I guess it makes sense that I would now try and scam one for $160.... right.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be doing the test again today so that I can take pictures and will post it here later today.&nbsp; This is the best I can do to help others not get pissed on by these lousy vendors who won&#039;t man up and own this bullshit they pulled on me.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let them pull the same shit on you.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is absolutely no way for me to 100% prove anything and I know this.&nbsp; So all I&#039;m saying is that this is two established vendors selling coke cut with meth tells me there are probably more and that&nbsp; EVERYONE SHOULD GET TESTING KITS so these vendors can&#039;t get away with this bullshit anymore.<br /><br />Dancesafe.org for the 4-in-1 reagents (~$65 for about 30-50 worth of tests, which are good for a variety of substances -- I also used them to test some Methylone that was found positive for Methylone but also PMMA, and this potentially saved my life) and EZTestKits.com for cocaine purity and levasimole testing.&nbsp; Start testing your cocaine for these dangerous adulterants.&nbsp; This is the only way to hold the bad vendors accountable.&nbsp; PinneappleLove is no longer doing his lab tests so we need to do what we can.<br /><br />p.s. -- I did the same tests with Sukey&#039;s top quality stuff and it came up *completely clean*, so hats off to one vendor who ISN&#039;T pissing on his customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;
