				I got myself some insanely good bud (Green Crack) from Midwest Medical that smells just like God&#039;s vagina. Friendly, fast shipping, great packaging, willing to take a chance on a newbie. Just an all around great experience. I wish I could post on his vendor review thread, but alas, I&#039;m a forum noob.<br /><br />Also, I threw in on a couple lottos for shits and giggles.<br /><br />Silk Road has been a life-changing experience. There&#039;s barely anything in my state but Mexican ditch weed, and now I got the best ganja around, and the cheapest too when quality is considered.

				I&#039;ll check out Midwest Medical, thanks.&nbsp; I know what you mean, living in the bible belt. Every time I have attempted to find some good bud, I find pancaked and over priced schwag instead. Looks like you can finally post in the big boy threads, congrats.

				I picked myself up an ounce from &quot;supercanna&quot;, aka SC.&nbsp; His service was fantastic.<br /><br />The same quality bud that costs me $340/oz locally for $235 AND it was almost 10g overweight.&nbsp; There was a lot of shake and broken nugs from being vacuum sealed, but I mean c&#039;mon.<br /><br />Best deal of my life.

				2C-B from a vendor named GoldieLox. Amazing product, he disappeared. I bought a gram though so it&#039;s not like I don&#039;t have any left :p<br />MDMA from UnderGroundSyndicate - Best MDMA I&#039;ve ever had in my life, he doesn&#039;t currently have a listing up which saddens me.<br />Ketamine from Marcel Ketman - Great product, good stealth. Will probably buy from him again in the future.<br />LSD from Jerseycow. I personally didn&#039;t get to try it as the time has not presented itself, but my friends tried it and loved it.<br />Adderall from HiroProtagonist - Fast shipping, Best stealth I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />Cocaine from TheStore - Utter Crap. No Refund upon complaint, will never buy from him again.<br /><br />I just decided to get a ball of Nod&#039;s coke, hopefully it turns out alright. The reviews have just been stunning.
