				I was about to place an order when I noticed the silk road asking for my address &quot;as it would appear on an envelope.&quot; The seller requested addresses be sent using PGP, so I figured I&#039;d double check here to see if it&#039;s ok to leave this box blank and just send the address through email encrypted with PGP, am I right, or should I go ahead and put the address in and send it as well, or put some notification that the address is coming through email?<br /><br />Also when sending encrypted messages should I also send MY public PGP code so the seller can respond, and if I should, should I encrypt this as well or just put it in the email unencrypted?<br /><br />I realize these are newbie questions, but I figure that&#039;s what this boards for. Thanks in advance.

				Always put it in the address box that way the vendor cant get confused as what address goes with what order

				Yeah I think it&#039;d be too confusing to use a separate email service to send that kind of info. All that&#039;s gonna do is delay your shipment and piss off your vendor. Also you pretty much never will need to include your PGP key. Just encrypt your address there and then correspond through regular messages. Just always encrypt your address and other sensitive info, anything else shouldn&#039;t be a big deal.

				Now I feel like an idiot, I hadn&#039;t even thought of putting the encrypted address in. I assumed it would be through email since pgp asks for an email. Thanks for the help guys.

				Always include your address encrypted with PGP in the box at checkout. Makes it easier for the vendor and it&#039;s also deleted from the system once it&#039;s marked shipped. The vendor will still have your address&nbsp; written down somewhere but they are supposed to destroy it once shipped too. <br /><br />I think most reputable vendors will delete. Creates a trail to them and could be used against them to indicate quantities sent out which would be bad (for them) if they were in such a predicament
