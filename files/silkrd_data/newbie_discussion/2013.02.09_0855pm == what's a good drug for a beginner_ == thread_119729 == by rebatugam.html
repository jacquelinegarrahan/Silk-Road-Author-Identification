				I&#039;ve tried alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. Besides those, what&#039;s a good drug for a beginner to start with? I&#039;ve been thinking about buying hash or weed first and then maybe MDMA and shrooms. Does that sound like a good idea?

				what are you looking to get out of your drug experience?&nbsp; have you visited erowid (clearnet).org?&nbsp; the answer is almost certainly weed tho.

				I think 2mg Clonazepam.&nbsp; It gives you this smooth chilled out feeling, then puts you into a relaxed sleep, ans wakes you up cleanly, without a hangover.

I guess I&#039;m looking for new experiences. I don&#039;t party so it&#039;s not for that. I&#039;m going to do the drugs alone. No sitter. I&#039;ve read about how psychedelics have helped people look differently at themselves and the world and get guidance and find a spiritual side and stuff. That sounds very interesting to me but I&#039;m just worried what will happen because I don&#039;t have a sitter and I have no one to call except 911 which I don&#039;t want to do obviously. I&#039;ve also had some &quot;mental health problems&quot; and some say you shouldn&#039;t experiment with drugs then, but I don&#039;t give a fuck about that.

				set and setting make a difference if youre gonna be diving into psychedelics - but id def start with weed (it is a psychedelic) before moving into anything heavier.&nbsp; then shrooms.&nbsp; protip:&nbsp; dont call 911 ever, youll be fine, youre not gonna die, it is all in your head. there&#039;s no way to really describe the experience of a heavy trip effectively to someone without any experience themselves - as much as you read, it doesn&#039;t compare to the real thing (which you&#039;ll understand afterwards, as you struggle to put into words something that is outside of language).&nbsp; you want to be in a good mental spot before diving in, IMO - I&#039;m a loner too in terms of not doing em w others so i dont think that that is a concern.&nbsp; happy to elaborate more if interested

				Try some stavia hybrid weed. try not to get on benzos until you read up on them. any drug you try make sure you completely understand the risks involved and what can happen if you od or get dependent on it.

				I guess it matters a little on what type of person you are.&nbsp; But if I were prescribing it would definitely be mdma or coke.

				&quot;mental health problems&quot; can mean a lot of things, including nothing. I had a similar condition and when I started smoking ganja, it actually CURED me. Since then, I haven&#039;t had to take the meds I used to have to take. Thus, I would recommend weed to start with and then jump to either MDMA or mushrooms. Both are pretty good to start with in my opinion.

				Yeah, I know there are those saying be careful, and I&#039;m not saying take 10, but as a vet with PTSD, I was *prescribed* 2mg Clonazepam, and I was down all the time.&nbsp; It won&#039;t pick you up, exactly, but it will enable you to not give a shit for awhile, and help you get some restful sleep.&nbsp; Plus, you can pick up 50 or so pills on SR for not a whole lot of cash.&nbsp;

				What you need is a grav bong and some hash oil.&nbsp; Get hash oil off of SR and look up how to make the grave on youtube.&nbsp; Then watch Katt Williams weed on youtube after you hit the grav.&nbsp; It will change your life.&nbsp;

				Just a nice bag of weed. (sativa strain for a cerebral/mental high, or indica strain for a couch-lock body high).<br /><br />Also get a couple of xtc tablets, or a gram of mdma. (essentially the same, but the amount of mdma in a xct pill is a kinda unknown element). <br /><br /><br />Smoke a joint, slowly. See how you feel.<br /><br />Then, take half a pill (depending on the strength of the pill) or 60-80mg of mdma. <br /><br /><br />This should give you a pretty gentle introduction into the world of mind-altering drugs. <br /><br />Totally agree with above advice though, head over to erowid.org and do a bit of research into what kind of experience you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have fun!&nbsp; <br /><br />
