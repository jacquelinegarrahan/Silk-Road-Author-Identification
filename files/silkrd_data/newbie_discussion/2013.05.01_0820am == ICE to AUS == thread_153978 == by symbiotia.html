				First of all&nbsp; take in everything someone tells you with a smile.. because the fact someone postedm eans they where actually trying to help you, this is a community of intelligent and very helpful people, we make a living doing what we do but we&#039;re also social creatures, you will not find friends by being sharp. <br /><br />But to answer your question I actually have alot of friends in Australlia and like all things come down to, it&#039;s the economy! Just like there&#039;s the real world economy there&#039;s a drug market economy and they both effect eachother&nbsp; drastically! In australia things cost MUCH more, packs of cigarettes are 15$ coca cola&#039;s are 5$&nbsp; their minimum wage at the age of 23+ is about 25$ an hour. so as you can see they make alot &quot;more&quot; money in a sense, causing the end value of drugs in general there to be more expensive. NOT only this... but Australia is famous for having very hard to get past customs.<br /><br />Any other questions feel free to ask.

				Firstly, I&#039;ll admit this is a new environment for me to do &quot;research&quot;. As I hope I stated in the OP.<br />I am not here to &quot;make a living&quot; I have always been able to afford my drugs as an end user. As an end user I believe I am<br />entitled to the best product available at a reasonable price. As people in said position are the only ones who actually contribute to the <br />system financially, why shouldn&#039;t they be. Drug dealers and crack heads do not contribute much money to the system.<br />I tried to ask a question and got burned. I thought this could possibly change the way the world views drugs.<br />Obviously it&#039;s still just secrets and deceitful, shady rip offs.<br />If anyone would like to offer any actual advice. Thank you, and thank to those who have thus far.
