				Hi Guys,<br /><br />We&#039;ve been out of stock for a few weeks, I was awaiting fresh (well, 10 year old fresh) Caapi vine and &quot;full&quot; Mimosa Hostilis Rootbark - not just powder, for a full on authentic experience!!!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a direct link to my Ayahuasca entry, you may find it enticing:- http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/150bdfcb3d<br /><br />I actually had it in for over a week, but forgot to update my &quot;available units&quot; what a dumbass... I offer full experience guiding, answer all questions etc. I walk the walk frequently ;-) If you want to know anything about Aya, just ask!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />B1g

				Not to condemn you in any way but what makes Ayahuasca&#039;s price so steep?<br />1 or 2 people for 1.2BTC.<br />Personally, that seems high but I am unfamiliar with Ayahuasca.

				Fair question, <br /><br />When we were selling in head shops, each component was going for around £14.99 (Caapi), £12.99 (Chacruna), £4.99 Rue, £15.99 Mimosa Hostilis Rootbark. Give or take 50 quid. That&#039;s around 65 Euros, now elements of this pack have been made illegal in the UK, and we do a super stealth packaging anywhere in the world, regardless of legality. Also, raw material cost has increased over the past 7 years. And yes, there is a Road premium. Also, the ingredients are very high quality - this Ayahuasca recipe has all the genuine ingredients, isn&#039;t a pre-made liquid or &quot;Pharmauasca&quot; (Rue and Mimosa) which is still going for half a bitcoin or thereabouts. The Caapi is 10 year old black vine, from Equador - one of the strongest. Chacruna from Peru, Mimosa hostilis from Mexico. Rue has already been cheap as chips, from Iran - but they are good quality - and other vendors are selling 10g of Rue for 0.2 of a bitcoin! That&#039;s real markup ;-).<br /><br />Oh yeah, and don&#039;t forget - I don&#039;t get all those juicy Bitcoins - Silk Road takes a percentage. Don&#039;t worry - I know this is the newbie forum :-)<br /><br />I am intending to increase the amount I import, this will enable me to reduce the price - but there is a lot of shipping cost involved, plus customs duty to get to Europe. In Peru / Brazil a European will pay way over this for a Yage experience, so for 2 people it&#039;s expensive, but for my costs and effort, just about reasonable. I am hoping to expand the pack to include Chariponga and reduce the cost by 15% when my new order comes in, within a month.<br /><br />Its not cheap, but it is the king of trips - it&#039;s 100% authentic, and in many locations, illegal - Scandinavia, US, Germany, UK, Australia etc. I&#039;m not taking the risk, doing the extensive importing and background work, and providing the service for 15 bucks in my pocket, if you catch my drift. The price will come down, but it will have to wait until I get a new order in :-) hope that explains it.<br /><br />Many of my other products have far lower overall cost and far lower markup, Peruvian Torch / Mescaline Cactus, Salvia, Kratom and so forth - but the Ayahuasca is hard to put together, comes from disparate locations, takes a lot of work to source blah blah blah - queue violins :-)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />B1g
