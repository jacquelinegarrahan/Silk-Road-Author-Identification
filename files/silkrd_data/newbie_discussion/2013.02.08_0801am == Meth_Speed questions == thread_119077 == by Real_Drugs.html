				Meth is so easy and cheap to make, so really makes no sense it beeing more expensive. Must be that it&#039;s much more potent than amphetamine :)

				Good quality Crystal Meth is not easy to make at all. You need at a bare minimum, some knowledge of chemistry and the various reactions involved unless you want to blow yourself up. There is also the cost of the precursor you intend to use as there is more than just psuedo to choose from.There is the &quot;cheap shake n bake method&quot;, but the quality is no where near that of lab grade Crystal Meth. Supply and demand are also a factor. If you live in the US, it is so cheap compared to where I&#039;m from. Many more customers + more vendors + cheaper and easily accessible precursors = cheaper Meth.

				Meth is stronger and lasts forever so I think that&#039;s why it&#039;s more expensive. I&#039;m best friends with Tina but sometimes I hate that it lasts so long. After 2 days of not sleeping I am MISERABLE. If you want something that you don&#039;t have to constantly re-dose then it&#039;s definitely worth the money though. Speed just makes me jittery and gives me a horrible headache, like having too much caffeine or something. Meth gives you this euphoria that&#039;s just....&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know how to describe it. It feels amazing. Been doing it on and off for 8 years and can&#039;t seem to completely give it up. As for dosage, if you have no tolerance then START SMALL. If you try to do a fat line on your first time, you will be geeked as fuck and won&#039;t even know what to do with yourself lol. I would recommend doing a medium size bump and waiting about 15 mins to see how you feel. I didn&#039;t take my own advice earlier today and now my jaw is killing me from tensing up so much. That&#039;s no fun!

Anyway the problem with that is that the meth on here is more then $50 a point but the quality is also better so you can either cut it which i have no idea how to do cause you somehow need to make it back into crystals cause im always shitty when i get powder in my ice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or you can always charge them more then $50 a point because the quality is better. <br /><br />I have some coming off a couple of vendors if you want i can tell you which i think was the better one save you having to test them also
