				Hi All, <br /><br />I&#039;ve been loitering around the forums for a while now without actually making an account/post but I feel that I now have a legitimate question to ask the community. <br /><br />For all my previous transactions, I have been using an anonymous, &quot;give cash and address - get bitcoins&quot; service to get my funds but am now a little disenchanted with the really high fees etc. To try and get around these fees (in Aus, the fees are 10% and a less than perfect X rate) I am looking into setting up an account with a different service, but it requires my real details inc. Mobile No etc. <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read, there isn&#039;t really any way for anyone (law enforcement included) to trace anything at all but, for obvious reasons, I just wanted to double check. <br />Is there anyway at all that anyone could trace my BTCs from my real account to SR? <br /><br />My current knowledge says its impossible, But I want to know what the community thinks. Would you risk it?

				Thanks Crygnie, <br /><br />I might look into blockchain.info. Do you use this because you don&#039;t fully trust the SR tumbler and its anonymity or just as an extra precaution?<br /><br />Coinjar is exactly what I am using also and yes, for all Aussies reading, you can save yourself a considerable amount using Coinjar over other services. Their rates are 5x lower (2%) and their ask price has been lower in every instance I have checked against spendbitcoins.com<br /><br />

				Yes i do use blockchain and coinjar is awesome so much easier then trudging do to the bank and instant instead of waiting 4 hours+ with spendbitcoins<br /><br />I use it plus my proper wallet just as an added precaution the SR one is fine as is a share wallet that gets credited to your account if you check your blockchain.info/putyourSRaddresshere itll show you alll BTC in and out and the numbers dont match up but i just dont want a BTC i bought with my bank account to go straight to SR

				^ What theyre saying. Bitcoins are easy to tumble and fog up the sources on, if you use bitcoin fog or something you&#039;ll probably have to pay a small commission where you can just run it through multiple wallets yourself.

I have them in CampBx right now. Thinking of transferring to Bitcoin Fog, then directly to SR from there, not going thru another wallet. Would that be good enough?<br />Also, Bitcoin Fog says it transfers them in several smaller amounts rather than all at once, will this work out o.k. at SR end?<br /><br />Bitcoin Fog charges 1-3%. If transferring thru multiple wallets yourself, don&#039;t you have to pay a small transaction fee each time you transfer them yourself anyway? Not sure how much that would add up to depending on how many you use. Probably not much I guess.

				As a Road member for over a year and 30 transactions totaling over 6 k. I still go direct to the exchanges with my real info, open an account and buy. It&#039;s too late to be scared, lets keep this movement going. What are LE going to do anyways, arrest 1/2 of America.I fucking doubt it.Don&#039;t be scammed out of 5,10 or 20% OF YOUR HARD EARNED Money by some fuckin middle men .I now use Camp Bx , easy just send them a money order and in a few days buy some coinage and send it direct to Sr.Or a wallet in between if your paranoid. Just change SR receiving address regularly.Don&#039;t make it harder and costlier than it has to be.May Sr grow and prosper.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and moving them anonymously to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				i&#039;d be much more worried about ordering drugs to your home address rather than buying btc non-anonymously and not tumbling. have you ever heard of anyone getting in trouble for buying btc and then sending them to sr? i haven&#039;t. i don&#039;t really think there&#039;s anything to worry about to be honest
