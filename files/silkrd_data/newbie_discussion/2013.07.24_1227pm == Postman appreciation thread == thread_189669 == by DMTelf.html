				The best drug dealer I have had for the last eight years hands down is my postman. Not only is he reliable unlike most dealers, he never asks any questions, comes at the same time each day, and even leaves my goodies in a holding store for me if I&#039;m out. <br /><br />In eight years of receiving about 200-300 research chemicals and drugs from UK&gt;UK and from china and worldwide in general I&#039;ve never once had a package go missing or be intercepted by customs.<br /><br />Big up!

				hey there mister postman....<br />thanks for always being so helpful, waiting on a parcel that should arrive today and its real stormy so the post flap on the door keeps blowing open and making a noise making me run downstairs in anticipation of an ounce of lovely weed only to find that theres nothing there but the wind, I keep falling for it, each time saying no i&#039;ll wait a bit its only the wind, but is it, shit better run and check, must have fooled me 7 or 8 times now

				I even heard a story about a mailman writing &quot;SR LOL!!!&quot; on a package (he prolly just saw a package with a bunch of stamps from california or something). A young guy that drives that little jeep looking thing like a hot rod. Everyone told him that the mailman must be his drug dealer! Doesn&#039;t get any better than your mailman knowing and not caring.
