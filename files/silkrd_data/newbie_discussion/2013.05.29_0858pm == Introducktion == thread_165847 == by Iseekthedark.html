				Hello all.<br /><br />First a little about myself;<br />I have, over the last 2 1/2 years worked my way through the herb, through shrooms, LSD, DMT and then the hundreds of other psychedelics out there from a spiritualist who has helped me get closer enlightenment, and permanent ego death. I am very interested in the idea of maha maya, and I lead my life with the aim of experiencing my plane of existence to the fullest, be it through the bottom of a metaphorical bottle,&nbsp; the forced states of mind, or the study and discussion of existence and the mind in order to reach enlightenment.<br /><br />As for why I&#039;m on the forum; the substances, and I&#039;d also like to share my philosophy, and maybe upload some trip diary entries as well as discussing your opinions on what can stretch the mind even further, and maybe even review some of the of the products.<br />These I have tried, and return to:<br />LSD<br />DMT<br />2cs<br />The Herb<br />NBOMe [to an extent]<br /><br />What I have tried, and disliked/won&#039;t return to:<br />Heroin<br />Some benzos<br />Cocaine <br />Methamphetamine<br />A bunch of other psychedelics<br /><br />Things I haven&#039;t tried but would like to:<br />Ketamine<br />Precursors for psychedelics<br />Ecstasy<br />All those new psychedelics<br /><br />Finally, a few questions:<br />I&#039;m looking for some fairly cheap psychedelics, something new/unusual?<br />Also, could someone give me a breakdown of what ecstasy is out there for a total noob and/or link me to a guide? [dosage/consumption/comeoff/cocktails]<br /><br />Unfortunately, I happen to have spent all my BTC away, so it&#039;ll be a little [2-3 weeks] while before am able to buy some new stuff from &#039;the road&#039;.<br /><br />On a side note, I apologize in advance for any spelling/grammar mistakes; these are caused by the rather high dose of DMT I have come off...<br />

				Hello and welcome.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If you want to try a non-traditional psychedelic I would recommend you go for the ketamine first.<br /><br />The k-hole experience is very interesting, nothing compares in my opinion.<br /><br />With the MDMA / ecstacy you only get one first time, try to get some high quality pill or molly and take it at a concert with musicians you really love. <br /><br />Be safe and have fun!

				Thank you for the speedy reply!<br />And I think it&#039;s between 2c-t-7 and ketamine...<br />Also, given my complete noobishness to it, a quick comparison between&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4-MEC <br />5-APB <br />Butylone <br />MDA <br />MDAI <br />MDMA <br />Methylone <br />MPA <br />Would be amazing.<br /><br />Sorry, but any guidance/links would be greatly appreciated.

				If I recall 2c-t-7 is easier to over dose on than other RCs. Please be cautious.<br /><br />I recommend trying 4-acO-DMT.<br /><br />MDA and its analogs (MDMA, methylone, ...) are not like tripping. Any event where tripping, dancing, or alcohol is acceptable ecstasy (MDMA) is probably good. I do not recommend taking it alone. It is a couples drug, and a party drug. The experience is drastically different in a social situation.<br /><br />MDMA is the popular rave/club/party drug and most e pills are mdma. MDA is more trippy in comparison to mdma, however I still have not had mda yet. I have had methylone though. Methylone is roughly 3x more speedy and &#039;meth&#039; like compared to mdma. Or, another way to think about methylone is it has 1/3rd the serotonin dump as mdma.<br /><br />MDMA does have a physical risk. imho it is best to take mdma no more than once every 3 months.<br /><br />Oh, and candyflipping (mdma+lsd) is AMAZING. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Ketamine is kind of like being launched into similar to an ego death, but without the intensity of tripping. Ketamine is addictive so it is best to try it and then stay away from it imho. In comparison, ketamine is more like a meditative ego death than tripping: like stream entry/cessation, but without the after glow. (I&#039;ve only had k once. Best to take this comparison with a grain of salt.)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why, and I have no idea if it is the same for others, but while meditating I get stuck and can not achieve access concentration if I have pot in my system from smoking within the last 48 hours. Meditation can be hard at first but I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />&lt;3
