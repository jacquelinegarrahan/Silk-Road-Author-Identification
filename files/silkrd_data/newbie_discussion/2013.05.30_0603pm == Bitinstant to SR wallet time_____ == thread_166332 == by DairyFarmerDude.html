				So I went and put my first money down for my account about an hour ago.&nbsp; I just got home and wanted to check its status......Well, nothing there yet..Before I start freaking out.&nbsp; What is the length of time I should expect to wait while waiting for the monies to be deposited to SR wallet?&nbsp; Should I just be patient and give it a minute before I start acting like wtf??&nbsp; Thanks for reading and offering your insights.

				Well, once the btc is sent by Bitinstant, it should arrive in your wallet in 1-2 hours, or after 6 confirmations.&nbsp; You can check on blockchain.info by putting your receiving wallet address into the search field!

				It&#039;s been awhile since I&#039;ve made a deposit via bitinstant, but I&#039;ll be making one in the near future and that&#039;s how I came upon this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, when I was making deposit via bitinstant a few months back I always went to the same Walmart and used the same information each time.&nbsp; Always bogus information, but a real address of a business in town that I have no affiliation with.&nbsp; They ask me every single time if I&#039;ve ever used moneygram before and I always said yes.&nbsp; Then they punch in your phone and info and look you up.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t consistent in putting down the exact same information that might get them asking questions.&nbsp; But not questions about what the money is for.&nbsp; Just questions about what your phone number or address is because you wrote it down incorrectly.&nbsp; <br /><br />One time the girl asked me what zipzap was (this is the company you&#039;re sending the money to on the moneygram slip).&nbsp; I just told her it was so I could buy some virtual video game stuff.&nbsp; Too many people are paranoid that they are nosy.&nbsp; They&#039;re not.&nbsp; It&#039;s a human being making small talk.&nbsp; Nothing more. It&#039;s walmart they don&#039;t care.&nbsp; They want to punch out and go home.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few times I had them send it to my e-mail.&nbsp; But a few times I had it go direct to my SR address.&nbsp; Again I think people on here are too paranoid about which to use.&nbsp; Nobody is going to go to walmart and check video cameras because you bought a couple hundred dollars in bitcoins.&nbsp; They have no idea where the money is going.&nbsp; Walmart doesn&#039;t and neither does bitinstant.&nbsp; That&#039;s the beauty of bitcoins.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now in my opinion the only time to get paranoid in the whole process is when the stuff gets delivered.&nbsp; For whatever reason the USPS scares the shit out of me.&nbsp; All it takes is one postal inspector to do his job and them to come after you with the cooperation of law enforcement and you&#039;re screwed.&nbsp; So from the time I place my order until the time it arrives I&#039;m a pretty nervous guy.&nbsp;
