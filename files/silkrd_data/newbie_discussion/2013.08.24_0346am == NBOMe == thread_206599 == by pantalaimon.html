				25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe are so incredibly cheap - why is that?<br />Are they any good?

				They&#039;re cheap because they are still somewhat legal, easier to make than LSD, and extremely powerful by weight like LSD. An effective dose is 500 micrograms or less, and you can get whacked out your skull on 2 or 3mg! So a few grams of chemical can produce thousands of blotter hits (which are usually around 1mg each).<br /><br />They are really fun and a good easy intro to psychedelics. The effect is somewhat similar to a cross between LSD and ecstasy. Really intense body highs, lots of energy, euphoria, colorful visuals and feelings of love and empathy all around. Trips can last quite a while, up to 8-12 hours, with a long and gentle come down. It would seem to be difficult to have a bad trip on these as well, provided you weren&#039;t in an overwhelming environment. From my experience, 25c is a little milder than 25i.

				How easy are these to sell on the street? At $10 bucks a pop you could potentially make a killing.

				they produced in bulk quantities in china... that&#039;s why they&#039;re so cheap... u can try selling them as LSD (already hat a couple of fake tickets bought of the street and a friend of mine did that) but if ur customers know their LSD they r gonna notice (this stuff has a taste and is more halluzinogen than psychedelic)... Candyflippin with these can be dangerous (due to heavy vasoconstriction). is supposed to be more 2c-X like than anything else...

				Irresponsible to omit the risks.<br /><br />LSD and other &#039;classic&#039; psychedelics have an extremely low toxicity profile, but overdoses of 25i-NBOMe compounds have killed people. Why bother with a substance of which so little is known?<br /><br />Do proper research and don&#039;t just rely on what people say on forums.

				They&#039;re cheap because they&#039;re easy to synthesize, yield huge amounts in each synthesis, and are semi-legal (you can only be charged under the analogue act currently).<br /><br />As for if they&#039;re any good, hell yes :) <br /><br />It&#039;s a lot like a cross between LSD and MDMA, but then again it&#039;s not, you get what I mean.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never done any psychedelics or MDMA before, I suggest trying psilocybin mushrooms or MDMA prior to trying any NBOMe&#039;s, they&#039;re pretty strong.<br /><br />When dosing, if on tabs, make sure you only dose buccally (sublingual never works for me or anyone else I&#039;ve asked), and do not swallow your saliva for at least a half hour. <br /><br />For me personally (remember, drugs affect everyone differently), 500-750mg (25c-NBOMe specifically, however dosage across all variants are similar) is a great trip, while &gt;=1mg knocks me off my ass and into outer space.<br /><br />Definitely a favorite, feel free to pick my brain if you need more info :)

A lot is known about 25-x drugs, people have been doing them for many years and there is more than enough information out there to be safe and know your dose. Check out the reports on Erowid.com. People occasionally die on MDMA and other common RCs, even those who know better, mostly out of recklessness. <br /><br />When I said these are good intro psychs what I meant was at reasonable doses a newb would be at virtually no risk for going on a crazy death trip and/or having to deal with unintended consequences like having a freak out and dealing with authorities. It isn&#039;t just about &quot;strength&quot; of the high, it&#039;s about the depth of introspection, soul-wrenching realization, and absolute paranoia that &quot;traditional&quot; psychedelics can induce at similar dosages. Which can be extremely terrifying and disorienting in certain situations, and lead to unintended consequences. Bottom line, start small and be careful and you shouldn&#039;t have any issues, if it isn&#039;t for you don&#039;t continue with your travels down that road.<br /><br />As for selling them irl, lots of people are doing it, and making a killing at $10 each or more. Most &quot;acid&quot; sold on the street at this point probably isn&#039;t acid at all in fact. It is unethical to pass something off as another substance, but in this case, regardless if the buyer knew the difference or not they would still have a great time. If they didn&#039;t they most likely would be totally satisfied. I have done every kind of hallucinogen multiple times and can say that many would probably prefer to do NBOMes over LSD or mushrooms in many situations, if they had the experiences to directly compare. <br /><br />
