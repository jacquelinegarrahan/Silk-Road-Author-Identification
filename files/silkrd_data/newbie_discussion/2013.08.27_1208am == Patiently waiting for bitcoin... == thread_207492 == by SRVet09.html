				I am in the process of a Moneypak to Btc transaction with MrSpankey, however I am starting to become worried because it has been many days now and I still haven&#039;t received my coin. Is anyone else out there also waiting on MrSpankey to come through?

If not then tomorrow.&quot; then on Sunday i said will the order be here today, he said &quot; I had hold on my accounts because of the amount of transactions I was doing. Should be up and running tomorrow morning.&quot; and now im still waiting...

				I&#039;m new to this, so I apologize in advance if this sounds dumb...<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming SR doesn&#039;t have escrow that works in reverse (where the seller puts your BTC in escrow). Is that right?<br /><br />But since you and the person you&#039;re buying from are both anonymous, wouldn&#039;t it be better practice to use something like BTCrow as an escrow where you can get the seller to put your BTC in escrow till you send the MP (assuming SR doesn&#039;t have the reverse escrow I described above)?<br /><br />Just my thoughts.

				I guess that would be a goodway to do it, but most vendors on SR don&#039;t really want to go through all that trouble, thats why you gotta pick ur vendor carefully.<br /><br />and SRvet i agree thats the only option we have...

				The key to doing any business with vendors is research ESPECIALLY with moneypack/reloadit cards to bitcoin transactions which are out of escrow. My way of doing this is to only do business with vendors who have lots of positive reviews in the forums and no negative reviews. Sometimes you will find 1 or two bad reviews but have to weigh the information - how many posts the bad reviewers has - was there a retraction posted (some people are too lazy or ignorant to erase a thread they started calling a vendor a sacmmer). <br />Now there may be a few honest bitcoin vendors here but I can recommend Moneyhoney. I just used her last week and got my coins in under 12 hours. Do a small transaction to make yourself feel safer. I did mine for 230 dollars (200 dollars in coins received + the 15% fee to her). If you spend over 400 the fee is 12%. She does vanilla cards and re-loadit.

				i havent been waiting nearly as long but im assuming i did something wrong. i went the virwox route and bought some linden dollars and converted them to btc and then sent them from there to by SR address. i looked the transaction up on the blockchain site and it shows the transfer of the btc from their address to my SR address. unfortunately when i check my account here on SR it says i have a zero balance.

				the transfer from virwox was awaiting a 2 day waiting period (since it was my first transaction) but was approved today at some point. when i checked the blockchain website to see if there had been any transactions there was a deposit of .58 btc (small purchase, i didnt want to spend a lot of money my first time since im new) to my SR address on 2013-08-27 at 05:01:05 with 68 confirmations. apparently as of 10:55:30 my .58 btc were sent to another address with 34 confirmations
