				I made my first order on Monday, was for some 2CB. Today I&#039;ve come home to find a postage not paid card through the door, it also has yesterday&#039;s date on it and a ref number, no idea what the ref number would be for. Makes me think it may be some kind of code? <br /><br />Fortunately it wasn&#039;t addressed to me, but it is a flat and I have a package to collect in my own name at the same address, just a pair of trainers, but I&#039;m nervous to collect those now.<br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted the vendor and asked for a refund. Should I be worried about collecting my other parcel?

				Honestly, the vendor should refuse you a refund. Or only do a partial. Fake names are frowned upon for a reason. I understand the worry of being busted in on, but trust me...LE would be more inclined to go after the return address/name than yours. They want to bust the supplier, not the consumer. Though it is a bummer that the postage was not covered in full by the vendor. Maybe they missed a stamp or something?<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor

				Chances are, it really is just the postage wasn&#039;t paid. Blueveil is right though - a fake name is no more secure and actually can draw attention to your house.

				Go pick it up, I&#039;m guessing your from the UK? This happens quite often especially for small packages, sometimes its hard to gage a correct postage cost I guess.<br /><br />Happened to me a couple of times, I shit myself at first but then just went down to depo and got the package no problems.<br /><br />What you don&#039;t want to happen is just to leave it there for months and months then eventually some one at some point may open it then a red flag will be added to your name and address, <br />so either go now or first thing Monday morning, they usually shut at 12:05pm.<br /><br />This is not a controlled delivery or anything, think about things logically here, would LE really go to all this effort for a tiny little bit 2CB worth pennies? No they would not, its good to be a little paranoid yes but over thinking things will only harm your life, go get it and thank me later.<br /><br />:)

				I agree with &#039;isthereanyneed&#039;, just pick up the parcel, don&#039;t worry. Anyone can send you mail to your address for any reason. You can always say you didn&#039;t expected it, but take it anyway to check, the fee is probably low.

				The object of the exercise is to hide in plan sight, nothing is out of the ordinary to the outsider (LE, Postal services etc.) Just another nondescript, standard letter passing through the mail, to you. Using a fake name and then asking for a refund is why proven sellers ask the rest of us to FE.

				It was in a fake name, so not sure I could pick it up now? Yes in UK.<br />I also have another legal parcel to collect in my name, I could go get that and collect the fake name one if they offer it to me? Or should I take the card and ask for it?

				I have signed for packages before without a problem. If your not available when the post office attempts to make a delivery, they leave a card. If they wanted to bust you, they would do a &quot;Controlled Drop&quot; at your place. The mail would come, and you would get a knock on the door right after.<br />&nbsp;You should know USPS Weight limits for known drug trans-shipment zones. I learned this rule living in Puerto Rico (a known drug trans-shipment zone)<br />&nbsp;any packages that weight more than 1/2 lb. are subject to search.<br />&nbsp;If you only collecting a little something for your head, a small package, the US Gov. is not going top spend thousands of dollars of man hours to bust a user. Not to mention that &quot;Knowledgeable Possession&quot; is tough to prove when a pack is coming into the country for you.If your a big dealer importing large amounts that is a different story. <br />&nbsp;If there was a problem, you would most likely receive a confiscation notice from Homeland Security or Customs, and you can be certain the postage will not be due.<br />&nbsp;Man your OK, go get your stuff

				For God&#039;s sake will people please STOP USING FAKE NAMES?????<br /><br />Go to the post office like a man, pickup your legit package and say you want the other package because your roommate / elderly relative can&#039;t come sign for it. It they let you, sign for it and act like nothing is wrong. They don&#039;t set up controlled deliveries by slipping you a postage due note. Just my 2 Btc.

				Don&#039;t understand&nbsp; why people keep thinking putting a fake name onto a address would make it safe when the post office has no name registered to that address it&#039;s only doing more harm than good...If people don&#039;t want the package to be affiliated to their name then get off your lazy ass and do it the proper way. Real info keeps the package moving without raising any suspicion and having it in one hand more then it needs to. I don&#039;t know about everyone else but, when I move into a apt/house I have to fill out one of those cards at the post office to register myself and others who will be in the new place this registers me into the new place also has my mail re-routed from my old address to the new. A standard envelope with a letter might fly with a fake name but a package would raise curiosity.<br /><br />Giving that a fake name was used I wouldn&#039;t go pick it up but, since you have something under your name to pickup...If it were me I would act like curious and ask to see it and pay attention to the person retrieving the package, take a look at it see if it&#039;s been tampered with while making small talk and crack some jokes with the person at the counter feeling out the persons vibe. From there if it doesn&#039;t feel right, tell them it doesn&#039;t belong to you and send it back&nbsp; &nbsp; Just except it as a loss and not send packages to the address any more from SR at the risk of the address being flagged. Expecting a refund, partial, re-ship is ridiculous and shouldn&#039;t ask the vendor. A message to the vendor advising what&#039;s going on, an apology, and releasing the funds is something that must be done. If the vendor is nice enough after that and just might offer a re-ship...

				the vendor should have used correct postage but you should have used a valid name so you were both wrong. the vendor a bit more than you. when shipping illegal products is your business then your business is to put on proper postage. buyer using fake name isnt going to protect anyone if things go wrong though. did the vendor at least pay you for the missing postage that you had to provide?

				not to be rude, because i know its your fist package.&nbsp; &nbsp;but just put &quot;fake name&quot; in the search box and you can see how strongly people feel about this subject.&nbsp; in fact, i think its in the buyer handbook.&nbsp; NEVER use a fake name at your address.&nbsp; Postmen often times won&#039;t deliver it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why?&nbsp; because they think they are doing you a favor.&nbsp; mailmen get yelled at by people all the time for delivering mail to their house that ins&#039;t them.&nbsp; &nbsp;over and over.&nbsp; &nbsp; in my apartment complex, you have to list the names of the residents on the inside of your mailbox or sometimes he/they won&#039;t deliver.<br /><br />the fact that you read the forums, and probably read a lot of listings before you order its hard to believe that you havne&#039;t seen this mentioned over and over again.&nbsp; &nbsp;i would bet that 25% of all vendors even specifically state this on the vendor page.&nbsp; &nbsp;i won&#039;t be listing it on mine, because i plan on selling bulk and i would fucking hope you would know the buyers best practices and read the buyers handbook by the time you order an ounce meth to your house.<br /><br />but after reading this..... maybe i&#039;ll go add that.&nbsp; &nbsp;NEVER do it.&nbsp; look at norcalking&#039;s page.&nbsp; &nbsp;he had to stop selling to newbs because of this EXACT thing.&nbsp; they kept doing it, and packages kept getting taken.&nbsp; &nbsp;he cut newbs off and guess what happened?&nbsp; all packages began making it again.&nbsp; <br /><br />i know it seems scary and i understand why you did it.&nbsp; it&#039;s logical on the surface, but in reality you are putting your package at great risk of not being delivered.&nbsp; and then you have to go explain to the post office that a package didn&#039;t get delivered for someone who was staying with you (etc) and please let you have it.&nbsp; &nbsp;and if you are lucky, you won&#039;t have to explain why your guest didn&#039;t come down and get it instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;because that story is a sucky one to have to tell.
