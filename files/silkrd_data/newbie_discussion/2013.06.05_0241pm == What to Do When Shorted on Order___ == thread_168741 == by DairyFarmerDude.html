				So I made a purchase...Got it fast.&nbsp; Which I am very appreciative of.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I ordered a quarter of some flame and got a bag that weighed a gram over an 1/8 leaving my bag 2.5 grams short.&nbsp; I have messaged the seller but not have heard back.&nbsp; I have not opened a resolve case as of yet...for I want to give the seller a chance to make right.&nbsp; How long should I wait for a response before I open a case?&nbsp; This was my first purchase and I&#039;m pretty bummed about it.&nbsp; So how long should I wait.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to open a case or have to leave dismal feedback.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not interested in being shorted what I paid for either.

				First, I would take a picture of the bag on the scale, just for evidence. Then I would look up at which time the vendor was last online. If he was online all the time and didn&#039;t check your pm&#039;s for like 7 days, I would open a case.

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I noticed the seller hasn&#039;t been online in 2 days.&nbsp; So I hope at least all is well on is end.&nbsp; I did however make a different order with a different seller for an 1/8th, but, the buds I got yesterday were consistent with the strain of the quarter I purchased and the name on the return addy was consistent with the seller&#039;s &quot;alias&quot;...As for the smoke,&nbsp; it&#039;s fire.&nbsp; I smoked a little bowl out of my chillum and I was pretty damn lit.&nbsp; I understand shit can happen...So I just hope to hear back.&nbsp; Thanks again for your insights.

				The seller appears to be an honest person.&nbsp; Which is the reason I don&#039;t want to do the resolve thing as of yet.&nbsp; I know a lot of good people are on here trying to make some extra income, and, that at times shit can get confused and an error is made.&nbsp; The dude hasn&#039;t been on in&nbsp; two days.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll give it another day or so before I act on it and do the resolve thing.&nbsp; Just sucks man...Thanks for your help everyone.

				Ok...So I heard back from the seller.&nbsp; Simple mistake like I figured.&nbsp; Anyways,&nbsp; he has offered to refund me some bitcoins for the trouble so that I may make up the difference with a second purchase.&nbsp; So my question.&nbsp; Do I have to finalize to get back some bitcoins?&nbsp; Or can he have a portion returned to me from escrow?&nbsp; Thanks for your time.

				As far as I know he can only pay you back the full escrow. He could send you a smaller amount of BTC if you give him a deposit adress. Did he say anything about this? Better ask before finalizing.

				Wow that sucks never encountered that good luck man hopes everything works out. Whatever you do, do not release the escrow until you get it cleared up. One thing about Bitcoin once its gone its gone!
