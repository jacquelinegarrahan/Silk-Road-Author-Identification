				use a trusted vendor who actually knows how to ship weed. than use a trusted friend home if no trusted friend than use your own address. why because a unsuspicous package to your place or a friends does not raise any flags.<br /><br /><br />try to choose a rich area. just cause cops don&#039;t like to keep tabs on the rich. ;P

				If the package is in your hands, you are most likely in the clear. At that point, you are past the point of controlled delivery. If you want to be extra sure, mark RETURN TO SENDER on the package and leave it unopened for a few days. If anyone questions anything...<br /><br />DENY, DENY, DENY!

				If the name is marked in your name to your address and you think &quot;Return To Sender&quot; is going to keep you out of jail or avoid a search warrent you have another thing coming to you.&nbsp; You must remember it is not the Police job to find out if you are guilty or not, they look at the situation and then make their &quot;best judgment&quot;.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t mean it has to be constitutional either... they will do what they please.&nbsp; <br /><br />At this point it is your job to be able to afford a LAWYER, they will be the ones to point out why what the police did was wrong and the JUDGE is the only one that matters at that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />MORAL of the story, if you have a controlled delivery conducted on you with YOUR NAME and YOUR ADDRESS... chances are you&#039;re pretty fucked, just keep your head together and YES always take the steps to assure that your lawyer can present your case properly. Never get discouraged, Mark Return to sender and DENY.&nbsp; Try to answer the cops questions at first but always deny and do not create hard to follow stories, just simple answers. Once it becomes evident that they are harassing you, plea the 5th for that reason.&nbsp; &quot;Officer I have been cooperating&nbsp; and I now feel that you are harassing me, I plea the 5th from this point on and wish to talk to my Lawyer.&quot; From that point on dead silent but you aren&#039;t sunk yet.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t open it and dig in straight away.. Even if you do open it straight away, if it was a controlled delivery they know exactly how much was in there. I&#039;ve got an idea of what I&#039;d do if I recieved a controlled delivery, but if I post it on here then get busted, I can&#039;t use it ;)

				From what i know in most countries you won&#039;t get a controlled delivery on small amounts..<br /><br />Also to avoid getting caught: NEVER mention Silkroad to anyone.. not even when someone else talk about it, it doesn&#039;t exist for you..<br />Don&#039;t go to silkroad in a public place where people can watch over your shoulders<br />Always use a name of someone that actually lives at the place you are sending to.. it&#039;s more suspicious if a package was sent to a person who doesn&#039;t live there..<br />Don&#039;t open the package right away.. Let it sit there for a day incase it was a controlled dilevery.. You wouldn&#039;t open a package from a foreign country you weren&#039;t expecting either right?<br />Always use a trusted vendor<br />Put tor on a hidden Truecrypt partition on a USB stick, so you can quickly destroy it once someone is on to you.. Be aware Windows users, Swap files may hold information about the use of TOR, if you got enough RAM, just disable swap for your own safety.<br /><br />If i think of more i&#039;ll add them later..

				Different ways depending on where you live. For me, I think it&#039;s enough to not have anything in your house, deny everything, and not have any traces of drugs in your blood. <br />I regularly smoke weed, which you can trace back about month if your unlucky in the urine. I can refuse a urine test, but I have to give a sample of my blood, which is more time consuming, and therefore wastes my time. <br />Would be interesting to see some info about seized orders. I&#039;m thinking about the size. I&#039;d guess the majority of the seizures are bigger order. Would like to know how unlucky you have to be to get a letter containing 1g cocaine seized...

				I have lost two packages in the past so my info come first hand. I have shipped via Fedex for these as well... Lucky that nothing ever fell back on me, once had a phone call from a investigator 2 hours after the control delivery due to the fact that I was calling the person that AM and I was on the phone with them when the police came in (They hung up as the door kicked and I tried to call them back several times. NEVER CALL BACK WHEN SOMEONE HANGS UP!)

				By the police, we are adult and were moving large quantities back then... The police always hand pretty solid warrant, which scared the shit out of me.&nbsp; They were very knowledgeable to say the least.&nbsp; One of the houses was a non-drug dealing house.&nbsp; BUT they had a small fun box with no more than 5 doses of LSD,MDMA,MDA and shrooms.&nbsp; The search warrant had them all listed PRIOR to the door getting kicked in.&nbsp; The tricky thing was that some of their box stash had been there for several months.

				It will NEVER be a cop who delivers the package and in a case of a controlled delivery the only knocking you&#039;re going to hear is your door coming off its hindges!&nbsp; This is a easy fix that many people do not know about!

				I agree it does but I was the top of the top, this house was Nobodies and the end client was the only one who knew the whole thing.&nbsp; The receivers did stash all their stuff at the clients house but then he brought it back after a day, so if anyone was the snitch it would have been him... Of course all ties from were cut from these transactions. **This was not over SR**

				As a vendor here are some of the steps I take.&nbsp; Never use my return address, but use a real one.&nbsp; Every few days I pick a small biz from my area with a generic name.&nbsp; Change them often.&nbsp; Don&#039;t interact with postal employees if at all possible. If I am at the front counter every day someone is more apt to notice the ever changing addresses.&nbsp; I live a block from our regional hub but I am in and out like a ninja if I must enter at all.&nbsp; I buy all my postage from the auto teller, don&#039;t use a cc or dc in your name.&nbsp; Make your package look good print right onto usps stickers, print directly on envelope when possible. Used windowed envelopes, blend in with bills.&nbsp; Do your best to leave no prints and make sure the package is clean and smudge free.&nbsp; Have all needed items on hand, don&#039;t have to purchase postage or fill out forms for anything your dropping off...that should have had been done at home.&nbsp; As you grow and network find trusted people in other states.&nbsp; Train them in your packaging method.&nbsp; Have them ship now and then for you so you have your things coming from more then one location.&nbsp; Drive across the state boarder if its close when mailing to your shippers.&nbsp; Finally clean cut, look normal.&nbsp; Most importantly in all things hide in plain site.&nbsp; People give me rave reviews on my stealth.&nbsp; Feel free to ask me anything else as I&#039;ve been vending a bit still have that (100) but am just now getting around to the forums and need post count.

				Idea for PREVENTION:<br /><br />(preventing jail time, not pregnancies)<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried this, but maybe it could work...<br /><br />Send yourself a letter every 60 days claiming that &quot;merchandise&quot; will soon arrive in your mailbox, with your name. It also says that you must leave such mail in your mailbox. Or else &quot;I&quot; will kill your family (include names), blah blah.<br /><br />So if you get caught, you claim that you were EXTORTED. YOU are a victim. The letters are the proof. AND, you were too scared to go to the police because of the death threats.<br /><br />You could elaborate on this and even claim to be a forced holder of drugs (probably a stretch). <br /><br />What do you guys think? Genius? Moronic? Both?

				1. Use pgp and don&#039;t tell ANYONE that you buy drugs online.<br /><br />2. Deny, deny, deny. <br />Even if you have a package addressed to you, in your house, as-long as you&#039;ve washed your coins, there won&#039;t be any proof that it was you that ordered it.<br /><br />tbh though, if you use SR, you *have* to accept that there is some small risk to you.

				its all about evidence.. <br /><br />DONT LEAVE ANY TRACE BEHIND. <br /><br />after you get the letter or the package, its better to move the dope to another location and burn the rest of the package in your bathtub, then flush it in the toilet . <br /><br />PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES PHONES !!!!!<br /><br />Dont talk about SR on the phone!! Always keep in&nbsp; mind phones can be easily tapped . EVEN IF YOUR PHONE IS OFF, COPS CAN STILL LISTEN TO YOU AND YOUR SURROUNDINGS !!! Phones expose your location... watch out .. <br /><br />Finally a secret is only between you and yourself ONLY. even dont discuss it with yourself.. your demons can snitch you out !!<br /><br />if the buyers and vendors are using proper softwares , and keeping their profiles low , and their shit together then shit is less likely to happen. <br /><br />Of course the vendors play also a big role in stealth and packaging.. but if the buyer detaches him/herself from the SR process and keep no breadcrumps&nbsp; behind then there is nothing to worry about. <br /><br />

				If&nbsp; in contact with Police in nearly any situation you bet is to talk as little as possible. Because there are great many things you can say that will not help you in anyway and there are very few things that you can say that are wrong if you get as far as an interview room put your put your face down on your folded arms say but you can&#039;t talk to them without a lawyer.&nbsp; As a growing vendor a lawyer on retainer is a smart investment unless you live in some small town some defense lawyer will have the rep your looking, If you live near cites you can find someone on retainer for less then you may think.&nbsp; Now you shut up and do what he tells you to.&nbsp; There is a reason he is a lawyer and you are not.&nbsp; Be silent.

				my best tip is to buy the product you want from a vendor that only specializes in that. buying from a vendor who sells 5-10 of the top drugs is only asking for trouble

				One thing I can add is don&#039;t brag to your friends about SR.&nbsp; My friends have begged me to let them meet the dealer I keep getting all this dank shit from.&nbsp; I just tell them he is sketchy and doesn&#039;t like meeting new people.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t trust my friends or think they have it out for me or anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that I am fairly certain at least a few of them would crack if the cops were putting the screws to them.<br /><br />Also, they&#039;re kind of stupid (I love them to death, but it&#039;s true).&nbsp; If they knew about SR, they would be tempted to try it for themselves, and I can guarantee they would fuck up something in the process and expose themselves.

				Be careful showing all your friends the dank!!You&#039;d be amazed who would grass you up out of jealousy if you&#039;ve an ounce or two,and trust me that is enough to have you put away :(<br />Only a couple of very close friends who I&#039;ve known for years know of my decent stuff.If I&#039;m going to a normal friends I&#039;ll just make a &#039;&#039;10s&#039;&#039; and go with that,because then I can always say I got the last one or some shit.May be bad fibbing to my mates but I&#039;d rather tell a white lie to them than risk being raped inside:(<br /><br />Come get high!<br />Come fly!
