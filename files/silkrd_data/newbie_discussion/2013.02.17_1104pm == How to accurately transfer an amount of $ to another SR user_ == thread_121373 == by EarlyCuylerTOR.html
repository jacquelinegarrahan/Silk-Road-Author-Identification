				Quick question, if I want to transfer, say $5, to someone how do you accurately calculate that?&nbsp; In the transfer screen the only way to transfer is in BTC.&nbsp; So what reference or rate is SR using to determine the $ amount of the BTC in your account?&nbsp; Did I even state the question in a way that can be understood?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Not too much because if it would be really cheaper at one site and more expensive on another, then everyone would use it to get profit. So the course is almost the same everywhere.<br /><br />Good markets from my experience are Bitcurex and Intersango. MtGox sucks cocks - remember this.

				It would be kind of hard because $5 in bitcoin will most likely be worth something different when the user gets it.

				I&#039;m pretty sure that payments inside SR goes rather fast, its all automatic and in one systemso why should it be slow then?<br />You can also send 5,10$ so you&#039;d be ultra sure that that user will have these 5$ for sure and market price don&#039;t change that dramatically over hours.

				1. Add an item to your cart, browse to cart ,observe BTC USD value. (currently $26.3959 per Bitcoin)<br /><br />2. Divide 1 by the BTC value.<br />1 / 26.3959 = 0.03788467148307123454778961884232<br /><br />3. Now multiply that times the dollar amount you wish to send<br />5 x 0.03788467148307123454778961884232 = 0.18942335741535617273894809421<br /><br />4. Round to 0.189423<br /><br />So <br />1 / (BTC Value) * (Desired Dollar Amount) = BTC to send<br /><br />
