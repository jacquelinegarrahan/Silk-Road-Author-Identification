				I&#039;ve used localbitcoin and its super easy and very fast. You can do a transfer or buy them in person and in both cases there are security measures in place (escrow and a secret code for in person purchases). <br /><br />Especially useful if your country doesn&#039;t allow anonymous wire transfers.

				I used coinbase cuz it&#039;s easy as fuck but the thing is you have to verify the fuck out of yourself so be sure to use a coin tumbler...which I gotta learn how to use actually. Oh and your first transaction for bitcoin will take 7 days to complete :/<br /><br />Idfk why but oh well...Im still waiting on mine.

				I&#039;ve used btcquick then transfer to your bitwallet then sr wallet. Btcquick does require id and you can use credit/debit card but, it charges at 7.5% fee along with a 1.99 membership fee.

				Guys please do me a favor and do not use ANY method where you have to wire money from YOUR bank account. Dont give the LE the chance to track back the way of the money and do not leave any bitcoin charging traces belong to you personally. <br />Use localbitcoins.com to find a local face-to-face supplier or get into the BTC community ;)<br /><br />Stay anonymous, cheers!

				I can help, i was in the same boat as you not to long ago! Go to localbitcoins.com, there you sign up, process is very easy. Once you have signed up, simple looking for a person who is near your zipcode or do what i did. Fine a reputable dude, with a good rating. I can refer you to my guy, he is pretty big in the btc world and can do any amount of transaction. buy or sell!! I deposit $$ straight into his BOA account and within 20mins i have the btc in my wallet. Message me if you want his info!<br /><br />Good luck

Safer, for sure.

				Depends how paranoid you are about buying the coins. I can&#039;t believe that there is a network of bankers, cops and whatnot following transactions of a few hundred, or even few thousand, dollars. I use the major exchanges myself, but there are more secure ways of buying, for which you&#039;ll obviously pay a higher price.
