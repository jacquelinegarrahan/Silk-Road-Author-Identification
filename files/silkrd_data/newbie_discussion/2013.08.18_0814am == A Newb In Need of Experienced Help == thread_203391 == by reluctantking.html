				So, I&#039;ve scoured the forums for a few hours and I have learned so much from a community that seeks to keep its fellow denizens well informed and secure. For this reason, I am embarrassed to admit that although I&#039;ve made it this far, I can&#039;t figure out how to get Bitcoin from my exchange of choice btcquick.com to SR!? Btw, does anyone have any idea how long it takes after using btcquick.com&#039;s google chechout before I get my Bitcon?<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone through the trouble of being verified on several services including &quot;coinbase.com&quot; and &quot;Mtgox.com&quot; but &quot;btcquick.com&quot; seems more expedient/convenient as I can use my credit card, but how do I go about getting purchased Bitcoin from btcquick to SR! I just read a very informative post that details how this works with &quot;Bitinstant.com,&quot; but this particular exchange service seems to be defunct at the moment. Must I somehow transfer bitcoin from &quot;btcquick.com&quot; (where I will be purchasing said Bticoin as this allows me to use my credit card) to my &quot;Mtgox.com&quot; account (as this site would allow me to transfer my Bitcoin to SR) and from Mtgox to SR?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to make a purchase from SR as soon as humanly possible and your help would be so greatly appreciated!! Many thanks in advance for your help, it is be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />

				You would need to find out your bitcoin address (a long string of seemingly random characters &amp; numbers) here on SR and send to that address from the account where your coins are. BTW, I would never ever send coins directly from a site/exchange/wallet that has yoru real information directly to SR. Ideally, you would start up a wallet on a service that allows you to create a log in using tor and send yoru coins to t hat address first. Then, transfer those coins to another wallet that uses a &quot;pooled wallet&quot;. This will help break the chain of ownership and ensure your sending different coins to your final destination, SR.<br /><br />Ask here in the forums which wallet services people recommend to you and take your pick.

				I have not used the exchange you prefer. There should be a way to withdraw or send BTC to another BTC address. The best bet is to use a locally install bitcoin wallet. Configure it to communicate over the Tor network by selecting socks proxy and setting the ip to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 9050 socks version 5. Move the funds there. Once they have been verified move them into the SR by clicking on account at the top of every page then &quot;click here to make a deposit&quot;. You will see a deposit address. This is where you send your bitcoins to. Start by depositing a small amount into your SR account. Something like 0.0001. This will allow you to see that the transaction completed successfully. Once you&#039;re comfortable with that move move BTC&#039;s in. At least enough to cover any purchase you intend to make.<br /><br />For added security use something like Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) as an intermediary step between your local wallet and SR. The benefits of which are described here (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.0). Note that SR does it&#039;s own mixing and randomization.

				I rushed in too quick a couple of weeks ago and thought i had it all covered and got burnt.<br />I started like you and bought my coins from a regular exchange that takes cc or bank transfer.<br />Then obviously you need to wash/launder them so they cannot be traced back to you.<br />I did a quick search, so a load of adverts for a site and did little background check thinking I would only have them in there for a minute so no one could still them that quick!<br />WRONG<br />what if the entire site is just a scam, d&#039;oh!<br />Easycoin DO NOT USE, it is a scam.<br /><br />Take2<br />Took a couple more weeks to read and really know what I am doing.<br />Now, buy coins from anonymous source to start with so there is no possible trail back.<br /><br />Localbitcoins.com, find a local trader and deal in cash, or someone who takes a cash payment into their account (USA mainly). I am happy with it, is safe as seller has to put coins in holding, there are release codes, etc...<br />Set it all up when in TOR, I use Tails to get into it so leave no trace.<br />get a couple of email acounts at safe-mail.net - I use a single account for just one purpose, do not mix. Ihave one for this forum, one for localbitcoin, etc...<br />Get a burner phone and only use it for localbitcoin contacts, makes it easier to meet up.<br /><br />Now you have your coins there are options to get them to SR.<br />Assuming you SR does not get compromised and seller to buyer coins get matched, then you just need to worry about the trail that you sent any coins to SR in the first place.<br /><br />Options:<br />direct - coins will be traced back to your localbitcoin account, but as that has no ties to you...........<br /><br />to Local wallet, then SR - seems like a good idea, but does it really add anything?? still the same coin/block chain, so there is still the same link back to localbitcoin. Good to store coins for a longer time though.<br /><br />to local wallet, to online wallet, to SR. There are some online wallets which mix your coins with others so not the same coin sent out. easywallet and blockchain have been listed in forums as good. Not used them yet myself as this is where i was burnt last time!<br /><br />You can fully launder with bitfog as fr33man2 says; they charge 1-3% and it takes a while i think, again not used it.<br /><br />I am going to try the online wallets and fog with some small amounts, so we will see how that goes! though I am pretty sure my coins in localbitcoin are already untraceable to me.............better to me more paranoid i guess!

				Thanx Dufas for the help as well, about bitcoins.<br />I&#039;ve been registered for a week on SR, &amp; at first,it seemed like a kid @ Xmas; the browsing for the head candy.<br />After hundreds of Fleebay transactions with 100% feedback; I&#039;m really getting pissed off reading this bullshit about these fuckin bitcoins! <br />I have no clue on how to &quot;safely&quot; forward cash from my bank to wallet bitcoins, washing it as you say, then more transfers, finally to SR!<br />All this sneaking computer bullshit is a real bummer.<br />The more I read the forums, the more confused I get! Too many options.<br />Hopefully, it will all click one day about these bitcoins. Thanx

				Be careful some services will confiscate your coins if you try and sent them to onionland <br />Open a wallet at blockchain.info get wallet address (always starts with a 1) copy<br />Then go to where your coins are btcquick find the send coin to, paste blockchain wallet address there fill in amount then send <br />When btc appear in blockchain wallet normally 1-2 minutes they have already been tumbled so cannot be traced back to you then<br />Go to account paage on SR click the get address link middle left i think long btc address apears copy go to blockchain paste address into send field fill in amount send then wait up to 4 hrs for SR to process and credit to wallet
