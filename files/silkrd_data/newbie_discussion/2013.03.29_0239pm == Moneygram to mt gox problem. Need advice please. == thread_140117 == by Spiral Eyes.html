				They should be able to trace it. I did mine and it took almost a day for it to get to my MtGox account. <br />This is from the BitInstant sight:<br />Where is my money?<br /><br />If you have made an order and are unable to locate the payment into your account then please check your emails first - for some exchanges (e.g MTGox) we are unable to make direct deposits and instead email coupon codes. If you are unable to locate this email or have other concerns then we urge you to contact support straight away with as much detail about the transaction as possible so that we can investigate.<br /><br />If you merely need to track a payment please put the OrderID into the form on our homepage to get the current status.<br /><br />

				Thank you for your reply. It calms me a bit. Tormail has been unreachable of course, so I havent been able to check my emails for transaction updates etc. ugh. What did you end up doing? Did you just wait and do nothing and it eventually showed up in gox?

				My ZipZap did the same thing. There is a clearing house you can find that will show if it has gone through there. My Zip Zap showed it, but then it was &quot;lost in space&quot; go to blockchain.info and type in your address and it will show you if it has gone through there on its way to your account. Let me know<br />

				So, I was finaly able to log into tormail and found a letter from Bitinstant, sent late last night, which said:&nbsp; <br />&quot;Hey there,<br /><br />This is to notify you that your order has been updated, please find the details below:<br /><br /><br />We have made a direct deposit into your MTGox account and there is no need to use<br />the coupon system on this order&quot;<br /><br />Then there were transaction id&#039;s and such. But still nothing in my account. So, at least I have something saying they have the funds. I&#039;m just not sure why it hasnt deposited yet. Oh well. Im gonna call their support number. Thanks for the help.

				I left town on Friday. On Friday I called their support line and got a voicemail, no response. Friday night I went to their website and used their LIVE CHAT (?)&nbsp; feature, which told me I&#039;d receive an EMAIL answer. No Reply. I tried again Saturday, no reply. After searching their site for some way, anyway, to get someone to connect with, I came across some thread that talked about this as having been a recent issue with many users. .. I just need someone with Bitinstant to acknowledge they DID NOT deposit my funds as stated, and that they will. Also, I made the deposit during the dip in BTC prices the other day so I could grab them low, and now BTC is $10 higher than it would have been . It&#039;s a little irritating.

				I have been through a few transactions that were similar to this. I had to email BitInstant twice and Blockchain.info once. The hold up was with BitInstant and due to there negligence they did not charge me the 3.99% fee. As far as MtGox, I have also had some deposits held up, usually only for up to 24 hours though. I dont know how many times you have made a deposit through them but your tormail being a tormail address might be part of the reason. I certainly hope you dont log into MtGox through tor, as eventually they will flag your account and make you prove your identity to get your deposit. Also keep in mind that it is a holiday weekend.

I&#039;ve used Bitinstant a handful of times, usually deposited to blockchain wallet. I did make a deposit directly to mt gox last week that went through fine. I do not log into gox through tor. And ya man I know it&#039;s a Holiday, and I considered that, but I mean the deposit was made Thursday, they sent email Thursday night saying it was deposited. I guess I assumed that if they were open to making transactions ( I assume they were on Saturday ? ) , that there would also be support available. All and all I&#039;m feeling better after hearing from you guys about this. Initially I felt like I had no recourse for getting my funds. It&#039;s good to know you had your issues rectified. Now it&#039;s Monday. I need to hear from Bitinstant...

				I&#039;ve had to wait about 24 hours for funds to get to my mtgox account before. If after 24 hours still no money then you should contact mtgox support with as much info as you can about the transaction.

				Six full days later and still no resolution. I&#039;m pretty fucking pissed. I&#039;ve not only lost my initial deposit, but also over $200 in appreciated btc value. I&#039;ve got one response from gox, saying that bitinstant gave me a coupon code to redeem. I have two responses from bitinstant, saying gox gave me a coupon code to redeem. The fucking coupon code results in this message : This code cannot be redeemed (non existing or already used).&nbsp; Not one person has apologized to me or given me any indication or assurance that I will receive my money. This is the absolute most piss poor customer service I have ever experienced in my more than 30 years alive. Bitinstant doesn&#039;t reply to voicemail for their support line. When they finally do respond to helpdesk emails, they tell me the same useless info and disappear for days, leaving me to have to keep trying to contact them. I mean, how fucking hard is it to address my problem?!!?? Its been a fucking week!!! Let this be a warning to you guys using these companies. I am being treated with no sense of urgency or even any care at all. I own 2 business myself, and if I ever treated a customer like this I&#039;d expect to be thoroughly ass whooped.&nbsp; It takes a lot to piss me off, and right now I am fucking pissed off.

				I&#039;ve pretty much given up on using Bitinstant &gt; Mtgox. Bitinstant as a service has been going downhill which is why so many threads recently show users having to send msgs to these companies to get their money traced and MANUALLY processed. WTF is up with that? I use MTgox to SELL bitcoins to USD but have relied on Bitfloor /LocalTill to BUY bitcoins.<br /><br />Last I heard there&#039;s over 4,000 people waiting to get their accounts &quot;verified&quot; on MTGOX. On Bitfloor you can register, schedule a deposit and have the cash in your account in less than an hour (or that&#039;s how it&#039;s been in my experience). I&#039;m not entirely advocating for Bitfloor since their market lags behind MTGOX and others. Ultimately for me it&#039;s still the best method I&#039;ve found for quick transactions.<br /><br />-CC

				Im with ya man. When I started here a couple months back I began with bitinstant to blockchain, and it was easy peasy. Recently I switched to bitfloor and I like that better. But last week I wanted to make a deposit ahead of what I KNEW would be a spike in btc value, but it was after the BOA was closed. Serves me right for being impatient..&nbsp; &nbsp;but how could I have known I&#039;d get fucked like this....

				If you purchased from BitInstant to a mtgox account, they won&#039;t deposit the funds directly into your account. What will happen is that you&#039;ll get an email from BitInstant confirming that the transaction has completed and it will look like a receipt.<br /><br />Then, like 7-8 lines into the receipt information there will be a line that reads:<br /><br />APIResponse: MTGOX-USD-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx<br /><br />That&#039;s a coupon code. You have to copy and paste that code into the correct box in your account information and the funds should appear.<br /><br />I hope you get your funds squared away. BitInstant is a hassle and does not effectively communicate how to use Mt. Gox coupon codes :(. BTC is not a perfect currency, there are many headaches associated with it.<br /><br />Edit: did not see that you already tried to use the code before posting this. There&#039;s a BitInstant newbie help thread on their forums that a moderator will help you out, sort of like a livesupport system. I&#039;d try there if their email response is slow.

				I awoke this morning to find that BI has finally processed my funds . I&#039;m a little disappointed that I was still charged BI fees and that I know have to pay $100 per btc rather than the $85 it was if my deposit had been processed correctly. Oh well, I&#039;m happy to finally have my money. <br />&nbsp; To anyone with bitinstant trouble, follow this thread:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.5400<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank you to the SR forum member who pointed me to it. Not sure if I&#039;d have gotten my money back without you. New deposits with BI appear to currently have about a %25 chance of failure, according to their support rep.
