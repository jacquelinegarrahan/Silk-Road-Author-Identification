				Well, I noticed the regular members have their Official Morning Coffee Thread going, so why not one for noobs. I&#039;m less than five days old and this is only my fourth post. I&#039;ve been up all night reading the forums and trying to soak up as much as possible. So now I&#039;ve stopped long enough to make myself a cup of tea the way I like it with cream and stevia. I haven&#039;t been as active posting in the last five days, but oh my there is so much to learn. Although I eventually (when I learn the ropes and feel safe enough) intend to participate in the process of purchasing a few psychedelics for personal use, my main interest here is in making a statement of support. We have rights as human beings to make our own choices. We need to help share our concern with as many people as possible. But it&#039;s almost like trying to wake the dead. Most people just don&#039;t realize what&#039;s going on. So good morning to all. Thank you for being awake. Peace.

				Well, it&#039;s a bit late for coffees down my side of the globe. So, I&#039;ll say a G&#039;day before I go to sleep.<br /><br />I remember reading a blog when first trying to find TOR and the SR. This guy said something about new buyers needing to rack-up 5 transactions before vendors will take you seriously. <br /><br />Anyone else come across this same myth?

				Earl Grey and a late brunch for me. <br /><br />as to vendors taking youngers seriously, from looking through the posts i get the impression that&nbsp; a low level of mistrust works on both sides of the coin...at least for the first year or two.<br /><br />re people waking up to the truth...i came here for the gear but the additional awareness and information and tools to stop the rot are a great freebie ;)

				Well I&#039;m back again for an early morning ritual of wake-up and learn. As I peruse the forums the lessons seem never-ending. Just when I think I&#039;m beginning to get a handle on things I discover a new thought to consider. This is school again, where the treats equal the adventure of the hunt. The discovery channel has never been so much fun. Peace to all.

				A little past lunch for me and never was a coffee person. I&#039;ve known of TOR and SR for about ~1.5 yrs, but only started in the past few days because I&#039;ve never had a need for it. I don&#039;t yet have a need for it, but a need will be there in the upcoming months and I thought it was best to get started early. My biggest hurdle will be buying bitcoins, because I&#039;m currently unemployed, living at home, and do not have much money to my name. I&#039;ll figure something out though!

				Colombian! 3 spendas! No creamer! And ciggies! Ok now to business, OP, its good that you&#039;re tackling the learning right away. I jumped on the site when it first started and didn&#039;t enter the forums for a year! Needless to say, things began to run a lot more smoothly after I did so.<br /><br />ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS REMEMBER, SAFETY FIRST and you will be just fine!<br /><br />-Judge
