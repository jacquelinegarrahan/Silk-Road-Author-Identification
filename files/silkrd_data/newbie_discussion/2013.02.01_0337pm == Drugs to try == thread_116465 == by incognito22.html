You feel great for about 15-30min, then you just want more cocaine. Then it&#039;s gone and all you can think about is getting more cocaine. No way near worth the money - you could get high for a week on MDMA or speed for the same price. Plus, apparently there is a small chance that coke can cause a coronary problem that, by the time you feel the effects, it&#039;s impossible to cure and you&#039;re already dead (I read this in a book PROMOTING the use of cocaine!). <br /><br />Here&#039;s the book - http://www.erowid.org/library/books/cocaine_handbook.shtml<br /><br />Wanna hear what coke turns you into, listen to the hysterical drugs-story in this podcast:<br /><br />http://acksisofevil.org/audio/inner157.mp3<br /><br />And then listen to all the other podcasts by Scooter - he&#039;s one of the coolest guys in the USA:<br /><br />http://acksisofevil.org/innerside.html

				On a more positive note, the only drug I&#039;d like to try that I haven&#039;t already is DMT - heard some amazing, if sometimes a little scary, things! Maybe peyote too, though I&#039;ve had and loved Mescaline and I&#039;ve heard peyote can be a bit more pukey than Mescaline...

				&quot;Heroin (just once or twice)&quot;<br /><br />My friend, &quot;once or twice&quot; do not exist when it comes to H, I´m not saying that you´ll get hooked or anything like that but H is one of the, if not thee one, most wonderful drug on the planet. But be careful, it´s strong as fuck, if you get a good batch.<br />Try SmileAwhile or MindGuru, FrankMatthews latest is not worth the money.<br /><br />Psychedelics is definitely worth ordering, I´v only ordered once from SR, LSD from Flying Dutchman, bought from contacts most of the time.<br /><br />Cocaine, buy from, if it suits your location, FrankMatthews, buy 2g for around $200 snort half and &quot;cook&quot; the other half into crack, use ammonia (+24,5%), you will NOT regret it ;)<br /><br />And I can´t express myself more clearly than this but:&nbsp; &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 METH! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br />I probably sound like a buttnut but, you can´t walk the long road of life without trying meth &quot;just once&quot; ;)<br />Look for good vendors, depending on you location, on/in the Rumor Mill, the batches often change from good to bad and back again on a regular basis so do your research before buying, if you get it right you will fall in love immediately.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Personally, the effects of meth and crack are just too freaky for me to try. I don&#039;t think I would feel comfortable even doing them once. Probably the same for heroin if nothing else but for the fact that you have to inject it. Fuck that noise.<br /><br />Coke is, by itself, one of the most useless drugs ever. Personally, the best times I&#039;ve had on coke were when I took it with other drugs (alcohol, MDMA). This poses significantly more risks for your body, but as long as you&#039;re only doing a bump or two or maybe just one line, you&#039;ll probably be fine. This way, the effects last longer and work together with whatever else you&#039;re on and its more fun. Otherwise, I don&#039;t bother with coke.<br /><br />MDA is fucking awesome. Personally, my favorite thing to do with MDA is to mix it with MDMA. You get the best of both worlds in terms of &quot;extacy&quot;. Some people say that if you&#039;re taking MDMA with it, you won&#039;t be able to get an erection, thus leading to some sexual frustration, but I&#039;ve personally never had this problem.<br /><br />Besides that, you are covering what seem to be the drugs worth trying. I&#039;ve heard tons of experiences on research chems that people claim are awesome or their favorite, but not once have I had a good time on a research chem. They either do nothing, feel overwhelming on the body, or just make me feel sick. I don&#039;t bother with em.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of that maybe you&#039;d want to try is GHB. Lots of people say its very introspective and life-altering. Have you done nitrous also? Some people forget to mention it, but if you haven&#039;t, duuuuuuude. Its a must, especially with just about ANY other drug.

It´s a beautiful combo which will, literally, put you IN Fear an Loathing in Las Vegas! :D<br />But it´s a slippery slope, get it right and it´s fantastic, wrong and you lose ALL control... don´t do it before the Sunday lunch with the family.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

They are to of the most wonderful drugs on the planet and they will blow you away with their beauty.<br />But think of them like this, actually think like this about any drug: If you are like me, you gave almost all the dealers you´v ever bought from the finger because you now and for the rest of your existence will always buy from the vendors on SR, yes / no? <br /><br />Well, depending on your location, you will always have this space, gap, interruption between the orders arriving in your mailbox, and those interruptions will, according to me, prevent you from hooking on anything.<br />Of course you can be &quot;smarter&quot;(dumber) than me and order a new load directly when the last one reaches you, that´s up to you but I´m not that smart (dumb) or rich.<br />You get my point? ;)<br /><br />Just remember: always do massive research on the product, how to use it correctly and the vendor before ordering.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				uhh i would highly advise AGAINST fentanyl if you are just trying out drugs.&nbsp; It seems to be really easy to overdose on especially if your tolerance is fairly low.&nbsp; If you like oc you might as well try H. just get a good ole stamp and sniff away, no need for needles and foil.&nbsp; Just always make sure to test the potency FIRST before blowing away.&nbsp; Its not like oc where you know exactly how much u doing.&nbsp; and btw, H IS the most wonderful drug in the world
