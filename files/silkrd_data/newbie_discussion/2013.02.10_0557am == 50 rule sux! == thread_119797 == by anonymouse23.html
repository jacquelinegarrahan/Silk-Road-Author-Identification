				Despite our colorful friend&#039;s poor choice of wording, I tend to agree with him. I understand the intention as forum spam can be a nightmare and with recent growing pains experienced by all of Silk Road&nbsp; I am sure there are even more issues than I am aware of but this only serves to alienate new users. They are the lifeblood of any site. I&#039;ve been around a while with my buyers account and wanted to outline a new sales account tonight but find myself struggling to get to 50 posts. The speed of TOR and this suite of sites doesn&#039;t help the matter. Maybe a compromise could be reached at 10 posts? Or maybe even allow them to post anywhere but only to reply to other topics rather than creating their own. It does a lot to curb spam and fosters more discussion. Or maybe both. 10 and reply based. I don&#039;t know. I am just trying to help by sharing the frustration in a better way than our dear friend.

				There are never any USD involved. You can only convert them through other means. When you transfer them or order something as you say, it just tells you what they are currently worth in USD so you have a better idea. It uses the average price from the markets that buy and sell the coins. Like right now if you ordered something for 1BTC it would probably say something like ($23ish USD) next to it. It&#039;s not converting it. Just helping you keep track of what you are spending.

				You guys sure that he will get the same amount of bitcoins back if the seller had the &quot;lock price into USD&quot; (or whatever it was called) on and then cancels the order?<br /><br /><br />

				Nope, if the vendor is using escrow hedging, a fee will be charged to the original amount.
