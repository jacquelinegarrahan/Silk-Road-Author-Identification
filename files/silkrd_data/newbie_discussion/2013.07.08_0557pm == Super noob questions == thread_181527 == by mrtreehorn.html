				Hello all,<br /><br />Just accessed SR for the first time today and have so many questions!&nbsp; Anybody willing to exchange PM to help me get some perspective here?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a bunch of the forum topics on bitcoins and some on shipping, but still need to get a level of comfort with the process before I make my first purchase in this black market.&nbsp; I&#039;m only interested in buying cocaine; few grams or an 8-ball at a time.&nbsp; <br /><br />My questions include:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; What is the likelihood of coke being caught in the shipping process?&nbsp; Stick to domestic (US) or safe with international?<br />2.&nbsp; What is the best way to avoid detection in shipping?&nbsp; i.e. alias name at my address, PO Box, alias &amp; PO Box?&nbsp; Looking for advice.<br />3.&nbsp; What happens if the package doesn&#039;t arrive?&nbsp; (I&#039;ve read about resolutions, but if it just doesn&#039;t show up, who&#039;s responsible?&nbsp; What does the resolution process look like?)<br />4.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a large, US city; are there any sellers who would forgo the SR process and just want to become my local dealer?&nbsp; How would I find those willing to make such transactions?&nbsp; Is that considered &quot;bad form&quot; in this arena?&nbsp; (Before you say it, I understand that there are risks to bypassing escrow, but for my level of comfort right now, I feel better about finding a reputable seller and meeting them with cash.&nbsp; Call me old fashioned.)<br />5.&nbsp; What is PGP?<br />6.&nbsp; What is FE?<br />7.&nbsp; Has anybody purchased coke in the US and have any recommendations of where this noob should start?<br /><br />Going to approach this slowly...any help is appreciated.<br /><br />

				Send me a PM if nobody else responds. I&#039;ll try to get to it before I go to work tonight, if not, after work.<br /><br />#4 is a definite no, so get that one out of your head.<br /><br />Good luck.

I have no personal experience but from everything I&#039;ve seen and speculation, if you go through a reliable vendor who practices safe shipping processes and go domestic you&#039;ll likely see a high success rate. There&#039;s a great thread on shipping methods to ask vendors about and look out for in the Shipping section.<br /><br />3. If it never arrives at all and no CD is attempted, take what info you can to the vendor and politely address the situation to them. Depending on what the tracking info says and the vendor&#039;s interest/stake in the claim they may resend a percentage of the product or refund, but there&#039;s no guarantee. If you think that a vendor has scammed you, first calmly talk to them and make sure that you&#039;re reading the situation right and then bring it to one of the appropriate threads and the attention of the mods. They&#039;ll review the evidence and try to help you as best they can from there but there&#039;s never any guarantee that you&#039;ll get any money or anything back.<br /><br />4. Asking that honestly might get you blacklisted, it would sketch the hell out of me as a vendor. The largest selling point of this system is the distance from the &quot;football&quot; and level of anonymity provided to both buyers and vendors. Why would anyone want to jeopardize that on either side?<br /><br />5. PGP is a form of encryption. You can use it to encrypt emails and communications to vendors and others. Essentially you&#039;ll download a program and generate a &quot;key&quot; on your computer that is unique to you and that you have a password to unlock. You&#039;ll have a public block of information and send this information to vendors along with an encrypted message that&#039;s signed to their encryption key. Using this information and the public key that you send them, they can decrypt your message and read it as plain text then respond and you can open with your key, etc. <br /><br />6. Finalize early, means to release the funds held in escrow to the vendor. It seems bad practice on here because it makes it easy for people to come in, pose on a vendor account and require people to FE then sweep up all their money and take off. For vendors to be allowed to require FE I think they have to have a certain amount of business and reputation.<br /><br />Hope I was able to help some!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Welcome to the Road Mrtreehorn!<br />1.&nbsp; What is the likelihood of coke being caught in the shipping process?&nbsp; Stick to domestic (US) or safe with international?<br />I cannot answer this one confidently, but I will say that it is necesary to find a vendor who claims they have stealth packaging.&nbsp; Also, check the vendor reviews on the vendor page or here in the forums.&nbsp; Domestic is always more safe, because it does not have to go through customs.<br />2.&nbsp; What is the best way to avoid detection in shipping?&nbsp; i.e. alias name at my address, PO Box, alias &amp; PO Box?&nbsp; Looking for advice.<br />Never use a fake name or address.&nbsp; Always use real name, real address.&nbsp; Many people prefer PO box, and I feel that the investment is worth it.&nbsp; <br />3.&nbsp; What happens if the package doesn&#039;t arrive?&nbsp; (I&#039;ve read about resolutions, but if it just doesn&#039;t show up, who&#039;s responsible?&nbsp; What does the resolution process look like?)<br />I&nbsp; don&#039;t have enough experience to help you here.<br />4.&nbsp; I&#039;m in a large, US city; are there any sellers who would forgo the SR process and just want to become my local dealer?&nbsp; How would I find those willing to make such transactions?&nbsp; Is that considered &quot;bad form&quot; in this arena?&nbsp; (Before you say it, I understand that there are risks to bypassing escrow, but for my level of comfort right now, I feel better about finding a reputable seller and meeting them with cash.&nbsp; Call me old fashioned.) <br />Mail ordering your wares through the road is more safe than going through a local and meeting them face to face.&nbsp; In a face to face situation, you risk being seen by police.&nbsp; On the road, the police have no eyes on you, and even if they somehow (very unlikely) found out there were drugs in your mail, you can drop any claim of ownership.&nbsp; I like to look at it this way; if I put a gram of coke in the mail and send it to George Bush, with Obama&#039;s return address, that does not mean that Obama sent George Bush a gram of coke!<br />5.&nbsp; What is PGP?<br />PGP is an encryption service.&nbsp; Software like GPG4USB and some others allow you to send encrypted messages to anyone who posts their public PGP key.&nbsp; (vendors post this key before their listings.)&nbsp; It is not necesary, however some vendors require that you use PGP when sending sensitive information like addresses.&nbsp; PGP encryption is never required for simple messaging.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; What is FE?<br />FE stands for finalize early.&nbsp; Silk Road uses the escrow system for your safety.&nbsp; When an order is placed, and the vendor sends it out, he places the item &quot;in transit.&quot;&nbsp; This means that it is on its way.&nbsp; When you receive the package, you &#039;finalize&#039; to release the funds to the vendor.&nbsp; Finalizing is confirming that you got your package and you agree to release your money to the vendor.&nbsp; FE&#039;ing or finalizing early, means that you release your funds to the vendor prior to receiving your package.&nbsp; Some vendors require first time buyers to Finalize early.&nbsp; Remember that the escrow system is there for your safety, so never FE!<br />7.&nbsp; Has anybody purchased coke in the US and have any recommendations of where this noob should start?<br />I have not purchased any coke, however keep combing through the forums to find a vendor with a great reputation.&nbsp; Also, if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br /><br />Welcome again, and enjoy your time here.&nbsp; Be safe and have fun.<br />-Shaman of the earth

I say stick to domestic. International packages automatically add a level of scrutiny to your shipment. <br />2. Do not use a fake alias. Generally, as a consumer of the road, don&#039;t mess with your address. You run the risk of not getting your package and you attract postal workers&#039; attention. <br />3. I&#039;ve never been through the resolution process, but it&#039;s my understanding that if a vendor can prove the package was delivered (through tracking, I assume), then they are free of responsibility, even if USPS fucked up.<br />4. If I were a vendor, I wouldn&#039;t give up the joys of internet anonymity, but that&#039;s just my opinion. <br />5. PGP = Pretty Good Privacy. It&#039;s&nbsp; standard encryption around here and there are a few threads that run down the basics for you. <br />6. FE = Finalize Early. Unless you trust and know the vendor, don&#039;t FE. The Escrow system in place protects you and the vendor, and once you sign off and finalize, you lose the protections put in place by the system. <br />7. For some pretty decent coke, look up the vendor Nod. <br />Welcome and good luck!
