				Trying to provide some SUBSTANCE, no pun intended, in my method to reach 50-posts (even though I posted a bunch before this new feature graced us, alas I digress)<br /><br />Abuse is a propagandistic loaded term in the context of the bullshit agenda-driven phrase &quot;DRUG ABUSE&quot;. It evokes stereotypes and reinforces prejudices against responsible drug users, and yes even those who IV opioids habitually can do so responsibly - usually in countries that don&#039;t demonize them and marginalize them into hiding and disillusionment... <br /><br />&quot;Recreational use&quot; is more ideal, and is what Wikipedia editors moderate &quot;Drug abuse&quot; outside of quotative contexts to or even more neutral is &quot;non-medicinal use&quot; which I&#039;ve seen British publications use. <br /><br />The same people who go on TV and have Ph. Ds and call Cocaine and Meth -- psychostimulants --&nbsp; &quot;narcotics&quot;&nbsp; (pharms that agonize the mu-opioid receptors and other other CNS that promote somnolence and analgesia) are the type that like to use language to push an agenda. It was not by accident btw that narcotics became a catch all word for &quot;evil illegal drugs&quot; to effectively ginny up hatred fear and willful ignorance of something you must group it into one word -- usually by bastardizing an existing word. <br /><br />On a slightly similar note, its fun to point out to people who assume methamphtamine is &quot;illegal&quot; is prescribed to six year olds. Meth. Not even once. Unless its called Desoxyn. Even actual pharmacists give a look of disgust if you call about if they have it in stock &quot;Desoxyn&quot; &quot;What is the generic name sir&quot; &quot;methamphetamine hcl 5mg&quot; &quot;...I&#039;m calling the cops if you call again asking for METH!&quot; Oh ok I&#039;ll just call it desoxyephedrine since you, a pharmacist, are so ignorant. HEH. <br /><br /><br /><br />No offense necessarily intended to those who might&#039;ve used it and didn&#039;t realize that the prison-industrial complex coined that phrase to plant preconceived biases circa 1974. There was a time I used it to. But it has a negative connotation built right into it: that using a pharmaceutical solely to alter your consciousness is abuse of sorts promotes subconscious rejection of the idea that a person can responsibly use even the most physically and psychologically habit forming pharms. <br /><br />You can often tell a well written article about taboo use of pharms by how it refers to (or insults...) people like us. <br />

				Meth, not even once.<br /><br />I always took that to mean that you turn into that without ever taking it once. <br /><br />Meth, you&#039;ll turn into a violent zombie without ever doing it once.<br /><br />Besides, the more these anti-smoking and anti-drug commercials spew forth their shit, the more they reach curious minds willing to read or experiment. Furthermore, how can you reach out to people who just sat through a Geico commercial or some screaming car sales advert? Don&#039;t do meth, but buy all this shit, get into debt, and have no where to turn to except for drugs... maybe Meth IS the answer? I can work two jobs to keep up with all that shit I bought....????<br /><br />Fucking marketing faggots... I fucking hate little bitches that go into marketing or get an English degree... why don&#039;t you do society a favor and get a real job. Mexicans (and all hard-working Spanish people) deserve America.
