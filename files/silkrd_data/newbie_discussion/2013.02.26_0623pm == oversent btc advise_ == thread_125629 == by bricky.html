				I sold 10 btc to a buyer on sr but 20 were sent in error. The buyer is ignoring me. No reply from sr admin. Any advise. I dont think I clicked twice - it was a bug as far as I can tell. I am Â£200 down.&nbsp; :-[

				There is nothing we can do from our end here on the forums, and nothing much that anyone can do for you other than SR Support.&nbsp; They&#039;re busy right now though, so it may take them longer than usual to respond.

				SR support is pretty swamped but they WILL eventually respond.<br /><br />Honestly, it&#039;s amazing that SR even HAS support....can you imagine if your street dealer had a support department lol?<br /><br />Best of luck with your issue, I&#039;m sure the SR support ninjas will get you sorted asap!<br /><br />

				Yes, support ninjas will help you ... but remember, they&#039;re stealthy and busy fighting crime .... oh, wait, no ... but they are indeed stealthy and quick!&nbsp; Might not seem like it in times like these, but with the sheer number of support requests they get on a daily basis, they do quite well handling everything!

				So you&#039;re saying you transferred coins to someone (SR account to SR account only), and it seems to have performed the action twice?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Check your accounts history page.&nbsp; Does it say there was a single transfer, or two?<br />&nbsp;
