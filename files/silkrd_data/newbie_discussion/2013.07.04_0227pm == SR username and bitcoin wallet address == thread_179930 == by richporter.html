				Title: <strong>SR username and bitcoin wallet address</strong><br />

				Hello,<br /><br />The exchange I&#039;ve been using to buy bitcoin has now &#039;gone legit&#039; and is requiring its users to verify their accounts by scanning and sending across various forms of ID (passport, proof of address etc). My question is, if I purchase bitcoin from this exchange and send it across to the wallet linked to my SR account, firstly would the exchange be able to tell it was a wallet associated with SR and if they could would they be able to see the username that the wallet is linked to? A follow up question is if someone were able to see that I&#039;d sent my bitcoins to a wallet associated with an SR username and were able to see what username this was would they be able to see the content/details of the orders I make with that username?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any advice much appreciated.<br /><br />Rich

				I have often wondered the same thing, however most bitcoin wallets don&#039;t require personal info so I don&#039;t think there is a problem with that. If you are talking about Mt Gox they require a verified account if you want to transfer fiat money to and from their bank. but you can still transfer BC without a verified account.

				No.<br />No.<br />No.<br /><br />Only way to know is if the Silk Road servers were found or compromised.
