				Hey Everyone!&nbsp; New seller to silk road, have been a buyer for awhile but thinking that I maybe have something nice to offer the road since its been so nice to me :)<br /><br />Sooo... I need some help heres what I need, and in the meantime I will be skimming through the forums to look for my answers as well.&nbsp; I admit I&#039;m a bit nervous, as I want to strive to provide bomb product, for a bomb price, with bomb service :)<br /><br />- What is the PGP encryption?<br />- I&#039;m wanting to give out free samples for some reviews, where do I go to offer this?&nbsp; I want someone who will actually help benefit me with real feedback, not just someone who&#039;s out for a free grab, albeit that is a possibility with this business I presume.<br />- On my store front page, should I post how its packaged like for my customers peace of mind?&nbsp; Like mentioning that the stuff is vaccum sealed, or mylar, or whatever?&nbsp; Or not a good idea?<br /><br />Any other advice would be beneficial.<br />Thanks!<br />Saucey aka Worcestershire Sauce

You should download gPGP and set it up. There&#039;s a big thread in this section about it.

				1. Not sure how you&#039;ve been a buyer for some time without using PGP or even knowing what it is. Learning that should be the first thing you do. Not too many buyers are going to want to send you their address unencrypted. <br /><br />2. Once you hit 50 posts you&#039;ll be able to post in the Product Offers section about your samples. Although, it sounds like you have quite a bit of research to do before you&#039;re ready for that.<br /><br />3. Mentioning that you vacuum seal or other similar vague details isn&#039;t a problem. Lots of vendors do that. You shouldn&#039;t be going into any more detail than that, though.<br /><br />Good luck to you.

				OK sorry I should correct myself.&nbsp; For MYSELF I feel like I&#039;ve been here awhile, but to other users I&#039;m new. I apologize for the way I said that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks dothedamn, I will look into this further, and start slow here making sure I go over everything thoroughly before opening up completely.<br /><br />Will let everyone know when I&#039;m through with everything so I can have some constructive criticism.<br />Thanks again!

				haha love how you get sample requests before you&#039;ve even got a vendor account or said what you intend to sell. here&#039;s some advice, don&#039;t advertise your samples in the newbie section ;) do a shit ton of research because the answers to all your questions are on the forums or the sr wiki.

				Heheheh... definitely talking like a guy from California.&nbsp; I recommend doing some actual purchases before considering your vendor account.&nbsp; That way you can get a hang of how business is done here.&nbsp; Also you&#039;ll learn how to be discreet and secure.&nbsp; Are you sure you&#039;re connecting securely??&nbsp; I mean, do you know how you&#039;re going to handle your BTC -&gt; cash conversions without being identified??&nbsp; I think there&#039;s a lot you&#039;re going to want to learn first before diving in.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend starting out reading as much as you can in the security forum and asking questions here as they come to you.&nbsp; Then make sure you go over the SR wiki thoroughly. etc.. etc..
