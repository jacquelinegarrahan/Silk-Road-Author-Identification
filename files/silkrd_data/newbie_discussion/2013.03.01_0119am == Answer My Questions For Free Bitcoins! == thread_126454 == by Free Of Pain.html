				I will be posting questions to help further my knowledge until I reach 50 posts and get set up as a vendor. I will be paying members for answering these questions. How will this be done? Every question will have one &#039;best&#039; answer. I will choose that based on which was the most helpful and relevant to the question. The question/answer time spread may be as little as a few minutes depending on how active this is. Each selected answer entitles the poster to a .01 BTC reward. Not a whole lot, but how much did you get for every other post you made?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />NOTE: <br /><br />If one person is selected as the best answerer for 10 different questions while this goes on, I will award that member with $100 worth of free product or $75 worth of BTC.<br /><br />-- Message me with a BTC address to make payment to if you are selected! --<br /><br />First question..<br /><br />Considering the time of year, a quarter ounce of outdoor shipped from Canada. I know some of you would avoid this normally, but if it were made available at the right price it could be worthwhile. What price would you have to get and what would determine how you review the vendor after receiving the product? What countries would you buy from? Include your country if possible too.<br />

				For a 1/4oz of outdoor?<br />I wouldn&#039;t pay more than $80.<br />That&#039;s pushin it for outdoor, but considering you&#039;re only buying&nbsp; a 1/4oz, I&#039;d say it&#039;s fair if the quality is right.<br /><br />I personally would not buy international unless it&#039;s really worth the investment.<br />1/4oz isn&#039;t gonna cut it. I don&#039;t even bother unless it&#039;s more than an oz, personally.<br /><br />I love answering questions!<br />More!

				I would say 70-85.&nbsp; But I also would probably not order international.&nbsp; I am in the US.&nbsp; I dont know if its easier to order from canada than other places, but I would rather stay domestic.&nbsp; <br /><br />But you asked what factors would determine how you reviewed the vendor.&nbsp; <br />The status quo on SR is that if the package arrived, weighed as ordered, was what you ordered, and was at least a discreet package (smell is not obvious, sealed like a normal package, typed labels), its a 5.&nbsp; As far as the SR&#039;s rating is concerned, its a very flawed system<br /><br />I was harassed and held hostage by a vendor for rating as a 4 for only being discreet rather than stealth on an order that was a personal amount from a vendor supposedly doing commercial size orders.&nbsp; Despite supposedly being of reputation around here and on the forum, things this vendor did/said dont add up, and I wont be purchasing from them again, but......&nbsp; &nbsp;I am following the status quo on ratings, and unless a vendor requested otherwise, is probably what I will continue doing, at least until my buyer stats are a lil higher and one irked vendor isnt going to keep me from buying from other vendors.&nbsp; So, what I am doing now is rating a 5.&nbsp; If all it did was meet that, I am leaving limited comments...&nbsp; it arrived at the correct weight.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it met that and I was also really happy - packaging was stealth, or really good product, etc, I will mention something like...&nbsp; &nbsp;awesome quality, or very discreet or great stealth as it applies, will return, etc&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, some people dont know what stealth means....&nbsp; at least some vendors and apparently many supposed clients dont.&nbsp; <br />If its stealth, I expect that a dog would not be able to find my package, for example, mylar, weight is distributed evenly (a 1gr product in a flexible bubble envelope big enough to hold several outfits, so the whole bag is just flopping around with nothing in it for example, is NOT stealth, nor is a package that is heavier on one side than the other), doesnt rattle or bounce around inside the box, cant feel the package from the outside of the envelope (you can feel a baggie taped to a piece of paper) sealed normally from the outside, and has a valid return address that suggests a non descriptive company name or customer service dept, labels and postage match - I know most vendors avoid going to the post office in person, but attaching a handful of lick and stick stamps to a package that is supposedly coming from a company makes people look twice.&nbsp; &nbsp;Idk, the stealth is just an issue for me...&nbsp; &nbsp;Im getting products that were legal not too horibly long ago.&nbsp; I was getting FAR better stealth from legal companies than I am here on SR.&nbsp; My last package had powders wrapped in a small square of wax paper.&nbsp; I mean, REALLY!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Processing time is important to me to.&nbsp; I know its difficult to pin point how long it will take orders to be processed with SR not always loading, but an updated average would be nice.&nbsp; Some vendors will say things like they are shipping every day.&nbsp; That may be true, but it implies you are shipping orders the same day they are made, when it is taking them 2-3 days to get your order processed.&nbsp; Also, I want to see it marked in transit when it actually is getting into the mail, not when it is sitting over night and not getting processed until the next day.&nbsp; For example, we all know, in the US at least, there is a difference between putting something in the mail at 8a and 8p.&nbsp; If its marked in transit earlier in the day, as the order is processed and placed in the que to be mailed,&nbsp; but doesnt actually get dropped in the mail box until 7p when there is no one at the post office, its not really on the way until the next day.&nbsp; So, Mon morning you are expecting a package, to find it didnt actually get processed by usps at all until monday.&nbsp; Its ironic that packages from sr are the only ones that take longer than average to get to me &quot;because the post office is slow or made a mistake&quot;, and I am using my real shipping information.&nbsp; Of course, all vendors say your package is not marked in transit unless they have already mailed it...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I have also seen the same vendors who post that, post about delays because a box of packages that were marked in transit never got sent to the post office or this that or the other, so we all know it happens...&nbsp; If it is not going to be put in the mail in time to get processed that day, dont mark it as in transit until after such time.&nbsp; But I guess that is me being picky.&nbsp; I might note that marked in transit time matched up to the amount of time it took to receive, if known (you can sometimes glean the general location with comments in the feedback or on the forums)<br /><br />So, if I ever ordered a product from you, that is how I would rate...&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 if it arrived at weight, limited comments if I was not all that enthused.&nbsp; Excited comments mentioning what I liked if I was happy.

				Hi there !<br /><br />If i&#039;m right 1/4 Oz is around 7 Grams which doesn&#039;t seems like a large order to me. So maybe it&#039;s not that much risky.<br /><br />I have a lot of trouble to correctly estimate&nbsp; prices. And I honestly think it&#039;s quite impossible until you tried the product yourself. All vendors tries to describe their product as top quality and so on.<br /><br />The truth is I tend to order quite cheap weed with nearly only forum feedback and the price/g in mind.<br /><br />My first and only order was ~25 Euros (~ 32 dollars) for 5 Grams, and the quality was very good for that price. There IS cheap and quality weed in SR you just need to find it (or wait for Stealth listings to reappear) And that was a domestic order to Fr. I feel 80$ is a bit expensive for that but that depends of a ton of parameters.<br /><br />Are you an heavy smoker ? Are you sure you can feel the difference between a 80$ and a 40$ weed quality ? Do you vape ? You will need to decide for yourself.<br /><br />My very personal advice would be to order nearly the lowest price weed you can find domestic and just go for it. I would bet even the worse weed of any Top 30% vendor is already of good quality.<br /><br />If you want to rationally rate a vendor, then rate it&#039;s PACKAGE. That&#039;s simply the most important thing in my opinion. There is a lot of interesting stuff about vacuum sealed bags and so on in the shipping section. Remember that a very well and professionally double vacuum sealed bag of weed will be detectable after 12 to 24 hours approximately. I think there IS an explanation why some vendors barely never get intercepted while over gets busted every week on at least one order. Packaging a smell proof, resistant and stealth package is MUCH harde than it looks. So if like me safety is your priority. Then rate their package.<br /><br />If you want to establish a long term trusted relationship with a vendor, then rate the way he writes to you. CAPS ? Spelling ? Speed ? Tone ? I tend to think that a vendor who&#039;s got 100% perfect spelling and professional attitude is less likely to scam you but I may be naive.<br /><br />Oh and take in account if this vendor asks for FE or not. The only legitimate FE for me is on your very first order. So if a vendor ask for FE beyond that limit, I would remain a bit cautious.<br /><br />TL;DR rating a vendor :<br />1) Is package stealth ? Always try to picture that package among the standard letters your usually getting. If you instantly see a difference, then something probably went wrong. The more business and automated a package looks the better it is. It needs to BLEND in.<br />2) Smell proof ? (Laminar/anti moisture bag or at least triple vaccuum) (Double vaccuum may be enough for domestic order since transit time tend to be shorter).<br />3) Security : Does this seller looks enough &quot;IT savvy&quot; ? Don&#039;t forget that you may have given your real name to this guy and that it&#039;s way harder than most people think to remove any traces recoverable by a good forensic expert. Simple advice -&gt; EVERYTHING is logged in Windows by default (Copy/paste, folder visited, file opened, file associations, recently open filed, history, cookies, thumbnails...). You are warned. PS: (Check for YELLOW dots on your printed labels)<br />4) Quality of the product as described (A vendor selling crappy weed labeled as such is not a bad vendor at all !)<br /><br />I hope that helped :)

				Thank you for the replies so far. Everyone that has answered the question up till this post can PM me with their BTC address if they wish to receive the .01 BTC reward. I will take some more time to go through everything.<br /><br />Just for a bit more info on why I am asking ... I will be a vendor soon and want to have the best prices on SR if possible. I plan to start by offering each product at or below cost, but I want a good idea on where to let them settle for non-sale periods. I think that outdoor would allow for the best &#039;eye grabbing&#039; as it will seem dirt cheap in comparison to other products. I&#039;ve only seen one vendor (with Mexican bud) that&#039;s even somewhat better priced, I&#039;m not sure how our products would compare at all though.<br /><br />I also want to build the best reputation possible and offer optimal customer service. I&#039;m approaching this aspect on the back-end in a different manner. A major problem here is scammers. I want to display myself as someone that&#039;s almost transparent enough that there&#039;s zero concern of it being a scam. I will have to look at the selling interface more to best know how to do this. I figure I could start by only selling $500 in products (in escrow) and begin to scale what I offer with FE specials for certain orders after I grow clientele. The idea of FE specials is that it will cover quantities that I am not comfortable leaving in escrow - after all, money in means money out. My main concern is not being able to operate fluently, so I will start by offering small amounts - such as 7g - only and work from there.<br /><br />I can see how a forum review thread would be most beneficial for the weed quality itself. I plan to open one as I will also be using the feedback. I smoke myself, but every strain hits everyone a bit different - ex: it may make one person an anxious wreck and make me active for the day. I could use the feedback on small orders to give a better idea on if I should offer the product in higher quantities too. I have a wide selection to play with so I will keep going with trial and error till I find the ones that are reviewed and valued the best.<br /><br />Thank you for any responses that are received in this thread. It is greatly appreciated and will help to make sure that another new vendor enters the road prepared with more than just the best intentions. <br /><br />Next question ...<br /><br />A cannabis vendor in Canada is looking to offer their product to every country in the world. There are different protocols for mail security in different countries. Some are more difficult - ex: Australia and other places it&#039;s more laid back. Domestic is obviously easy enough. What I want to know is what specific steps / rules should be in place when looking to get US and International orders AND what is typical to happen if the package does not make it to the recipient in an overseas order?<br /><br /><br />

But it was very respectable. Comparable in quality to some outdoor African buds which have a loyal following - so at the right price you&#039;ll have a market.<br /><br />I&#039;m based in EU and had orders arrive from all corners of the earth - only order not to make it were two scams which never got sent...<br /><br />But you need to invest in vacuum packing thingy and read up bout good shipping methods for international orders. The more like a letter the better I&#039;d say...<br /><br />if a package is seized it just gets destroyed or smoked by customs - and the addressee notified of confiscation - I doubt that big investigations are started for relatively small quantities.<br /><br />LE want big busts to make headlines - kilos of things worth hundreds of thousands!

				I&#039;d personally pay $60-80 for a q of outdoor, the stealth and product description to actual product quality are all I would take in mind when leaving feedback/reviewing. I&#039;m Australian so I prefer to buy weed internationally because at the moment most Aus vendors charge through the roof. I buy from any country except NL due to the risk associated. <br />Hope I helped out.<br />edit: I&#039;d also recommend reading this for stealth http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0
