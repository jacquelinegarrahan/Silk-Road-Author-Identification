				Urban legend my ass!&nbsp; that shit happens on the regular!&nbsp; in fact, when looking at the statistics only something like 40% of alerts actually find drugs, the rest are written off as an accident in such a way that it doesn&#039;t look like the dog was wrong.&nbsp; Later the officers will attest to a &#039;suspicious vehicle&#039; passing moments before the alert and claim the smell of marijuana was wafting from the vehicle so the k9 &#039;actually alerted properly&#039;, but was just mistaken on the source.<br /><br />Seriously, it&#039;s fucked up but it happens on the regular!

				i read in another post that they have some control over this. The idea, to my knowledge, is that it is a way for LE to cut corners as it is probable cause to search shit without a warrant. A few different people said the handlers are watching for suspicious people avoiding the dogs, for example if there are 3 paths to a venue one of which has a k9 unit your more likely to be stopped if your avoiding that path. If you&#039;ve got something to hide your going to avoid. I guess you run the risk of the k9 actually reacting to you. like others have said no concrete evidence maybe someone can shed light on this.

				I have directly had multiple K9 police signal for thier dogs to alert on my cars when I was pulled over. The first time I was pulled over and I was with 2 other people. We didnt have any illegal drugs on us but I was coming from a pain clinic and my friend just legally obtained 240 roxys, 120 xanax 1mg, and 100 vicodin 5/500. I think the police knew that the doctor was handing out pills and thats why they were there and thats why we got pulled. So they ask me if they can search and I say no why are you pulling me over. But they cant give any legal reason so I say no call your supervisor. Instead they call a K9 and right in front of all 3 of us he said a word in another language or a made up word, but it wasnt English and the dog stopped sniffing immediately look at the cop then at the door he was buy and jumped up and started scratching it and barking. So now they say the dog alerted and they search all of us and the car but they only find the pills my friend got from the doctor. They say the pills were obtained illegally and take the pills and hand my friend a form that he can fill out asking for them back and saying he must submit proof to a doctor that works for the sheriff if he wants them back.<br /><br />The 2nd time I had police signal thier drug dog despite not having was when I was driving through West Virgina and I stopped at what seemed like the only motel for 100 miles. I was really tired because I had a long drive so I rented a room for the night. When I got to the counter the lady told me the price, it was like $55, wow cheap as hell. So I park my car outside and go too the room and sleep. I am woken at about 4am by 2 cops banging on the door. I didnt do anything wrong so I figured fuck I will see what they want, plus they were banging so hard it was loud as fuck. So they say thier dog alerted for drugs on a black car with californa plates. So I think fuck thats my car so I go out there but I tell them there is no drugs. Then they start giving me shit and they are like this is a high drug and high crime area. They say this is also say that the area is a low income area and that my car looks out of place. So they do the dog in front of me and this time the cop gives a hand gesture after getting the dogs attention and again the police dog alerts. They search my car and tear it apart and they swear that I have drugs but they couldnt find them. <br /><br />Cops will do anything if they think you are trouble. 2 times was simply following the law but the police thought I was breaking it so they themselves broke the law so they could search me and my vehicle.

				some weird youtube vid claimed that you tire the dogs out and confuse them. Of course I don&#039;t mean packages, and I don&#039;t think it would be good on your car (especially if you had something in it).<br />Anyways it was for your home. the claim was that dogs get tired/bored/distracted fairly quickly. So your job is to mess with them as much as possible to get them to that limit. either that or have the handler get so frustrated they give up with the dog. This was achieved (claimed to be achieved) by things like<br />for weed:<br />-grind your clippings and any seeds up and spread them all around your property in SMALL doses. <br />-fill a bag with clippings or shake, rub the closed bag on every surface you can, including inside cabinets and such.<br /><br />again never tried this, its only off the interwebs. but it would be amusing.

				This is definitely not an urban legend, this is fact. Google Barry Cooper how not to get caught. He is an ex-narcotics agent who gives all sorts of details about LE that they don&#039;t want you to know about; one of them being false alerts. He shows a video of a dog being taught to false &quot;hit&quot; on different things. Also, he suggests parking next to road kill in the case of getting pulled over and the miracle that a dead deer is lying nearby. Food inside a car can also make a dog&#039;s hit unreliable. I am a paranoid freak in my small town area, with cops who become cops because of their small penises who prey on potheads and chum up with drunks, so I often would put my weed in an old McDonalds sack or something... the officer would probably think his hound is just after my Big Mac scraps. Anyway, false alerts are definitely real... Barry Cooper is the man. Check him out.

				this is used all the time at international borders as an excuse to tear your vehicle apart based on the officers hunch. when the dog alerts to nothing then the handler encourages the dog through tone of voice to -find it boy! find the dope boy! get it boy! pavlavs k9 then becomes excited and alerts. <br /><br />its cool when they tear the truck apart and find nothing though.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t seen that video, but there&#039;s two types of &#039;alerts&#039;.&nbsp; 1 is a vicious attack of whatever they&#039;re alerting on.&nbsp; More frequently(I think) they&#039;re trained to sit on alert.&nbsp; I&#039;ve watched on several occasions an officer leading a &#039;k9 officer&#039; around a car, then firmly saying &#039;heel&#039;.&nbsp; The dog then sits and the officer&#039;s make a big deal about how it alerted.

				Cops are the biggest liars around.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen them falsely alert to a car, and after finding nothing,&nbsp; they said there must have been something there that left a smell.&nbsp; BS!&nbsp; Liars!

I have not read through this thread and had to comment because I know first hand it is true and it can be done with a flick of a finger or a facial gesture. These K-9&#039;s are LEO&#039;s and that gives probable cause for search.&nbsp; This is a FACT.&nbsp; It is rare to fool these dogs when it come to smells but it is possible.&nbsp; ;)
