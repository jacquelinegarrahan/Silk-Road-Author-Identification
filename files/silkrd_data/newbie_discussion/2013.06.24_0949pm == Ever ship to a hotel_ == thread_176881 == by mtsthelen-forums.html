				Curious if anyone&#039;s ever had a SR shipment sent to themselves (with their real name, natch) while staying at a hotel? I realize that would require timing the shipping with the vendor appropriately, but that can be done with a nominal amount of work for most domestic shipments.<br /><br />I&#039;m just thinking this might be better than having it delivered to one&#039;s home. Certainly LE could dig in with the hotel and get your home address if they wanted, but at least you wouldn&#039;t be giving your home address to a SR vendor.

				ive sent packages to hotels before, but nothing from SR. but since i have sent normal packages before, i would definitely at least try it on vacation<br /><br />just make sure its addressed to the hotel name &amp; address<br />and on the bottom have them put it to your attention, as a guest<br /><br />even better if you had the hotel room number

				I had a vacation not to long ago and didn&#039;t receive my package from SR on time before I left. It ended up coming while I was across the country...<br /><br />Had a friend put the package into another package and ship it to me with my real info. Sent it to a State Campground actually which is probably not the brightest thing to do. But I got it and everything was fine.

				Have had several items (both Silk Road and not) sent to a hotel room before and haven&#039;t had any dramas<br /><br />this was over 12 months ago though.
