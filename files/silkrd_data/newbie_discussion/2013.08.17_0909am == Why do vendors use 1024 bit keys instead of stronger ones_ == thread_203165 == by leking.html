				So I already asked this in the PGP thread, but with the many posts it went under...<br /><br />I noticed most vendors using 1024 or 2048 bit keys.<br />How come they don&#039;t use the highest security available? (4096bit)<br /><br />I know also 1024 is not crackable (at least from what we know), but still the extra effort is so small... Considering all the other safety precautions that everyone takes, this one strikes me as odd...

				Presumably most vendors are not computer nerds, first and foremost?<br /><br />Not sure that you are going to get a definitive answer on this one...<br /><br />

				But it is literally a difference of 2 seconds (just choosing another keystrength from the dropdown when creating it)

				I have come across some vendors who don&#039;t use GPG at all and want to run all their secure communications through privnote. Their reasoning is that it is a totally secure service and that all messages are deleted after being read.<br /><br />This indicates that the vendor does not question WHO runs that service, and if they can be trusted or not.<br /><br />I bring this up, to highlight that we make choices based upon what we &#039;know&#039;.<br /><br />If you are not aware what a key is, or why its length matters, then you may not think to choose a longer key....<br /><br />Maybe message the vendor with a relevant article about why they should go for a longer key?<br /><br />That said - they might not appreciate it ;)

				Noticed a couple of new and popular U.K vendors stating they don&#039;t accept PGP at all which is extremely odd.
