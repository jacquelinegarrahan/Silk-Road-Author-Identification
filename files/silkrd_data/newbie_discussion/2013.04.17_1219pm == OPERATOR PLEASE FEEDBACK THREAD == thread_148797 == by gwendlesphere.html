				Seeing as I can&#039;t post in big boy forums yet, I&#039;d like to do the honour of giving feedback and a report from my trip on operatorplease&#039;s acid:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Review of LSD for operatorplease<br />As my tolerance for almost all drugs except for most available australian ecstacy pills is reasonably low, I decided to have a small taster test of a blotter, and took only 1/2 of a singular blotter. The effects are pretty noticeable within the first hour of a small dose (which is unusual, often it takes a good hour and half for a small dose to take effect for me). One main thing I get from acid is quite a lot of muscular tension, but I thought with a small dose I wouldn&#039;t need any benzo&#039;s to relax my muscles. I was right :)<br /><br />1420 - Dropped 1/2 of blotter<br />1435 - Needing to stretch/yawning a little bit<br />1440 - Already feeling slight diskynesis and odd visual misreception <br />1500 - Slight chills and clenching jaw and very good euphoric feeling, colours brighter, outside is sunny and everything is very bright and feeling nice and significant :)<br />1630 - Extremely giddy, colours very bright.. Life is generally pretty awesome<br />1800-1900 - Almost hyperactive, complete euphoria, creative juices flowing very heavily, sat immediately in front of my digital recorder and started making fucking fun as hell rock and roll music similar to very old whitesnake and Joe Cocker, dancing like a spastic child to the music as I&#039;m recording it<br />2000-2100 - Feeling slightly stronger waves of the acid, beginning slightly introspective thoughts, but as it was so minor, eventually my introspection is drowned once again in euphoria and creative fun<br />2130 - within 2 hours have made a fucking amazing, fun, rock and roll track with fairly impressive production... went driving to get cigarettes and chewing gum, lets just say that driving was like driving in mario karts to say the least; very exaggerated visual movements and lighting as i drive the 1 minutes drive to the shop... in fucking awe at how good the little trip is going on such a small dose :)<br />2200 - still feeling fucking great, slightly less hyperactive by i am still munting as if im on x<br /><br />Overall great day/night, very productive. Definitely fucking getting more of this. Thanks heaps OP, keep up the good work <br />10/10</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OP&#039;s page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/54ae55179c<br /><br />:) :)&nbsp; 8)
