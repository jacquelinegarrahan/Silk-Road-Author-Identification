				Opiates are a scary class of drugs. Searching for that relaxation... chasing that high. You&#039;ll never feel &quot;full&quot;. Sobriety is best imo

				Sitting on some Oxy at home. Keeping it to a once a month deal. Even so - I hear what you&#039;re saying.<br /><br />So I guess you&#039;d advise against a CWE this weekend and going a little large?

				I agree with all the anti-opiate posts. Leads to death. I sell them and I try to keep everyone away from them as much as possible.<br /><br />Danger danger danger.<br /><br />If you have some at home, sell them to me and get rid of them.<br /><br />Modzi

				Hey Modicum I just popped a couple 30mg oxy&#039;s it&#039;s some good stuff, but yeah I&#039;d advise against going large only because it ups your tollerance and forces you to take more in the future. IDK though up to you!<br /><br />And yeah bizzity you are always chasing that high, I&#039;ve got a gram of H coming in today express but still I couldn&#039;t resist copping 12 blues yesterday. It&#039;s more than relaxation even it&#039;s the ultimate comfort and contendedness.<br /><br />Modziw I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen the worst of opiates as an oxy dealer.

				I&#039;ve always kept my opiate dosing low smartly. The more spaced out you do, the lower you can afford to dose. Also, careful when &quot;upping the ante&quot; so to speak. Most people start out by orally consuming drugs (low bioavailability, less intense high), then snorting (moderate bioavailability - substance depending, more intense high), thens hooting (highest bioavailability, most intense high). It makes sense, but as you progress stages, each stage gets more &quot;Okay&quot;/&quot;Acceptable&quot; but if you don&#039;t up that stage, you won&#039;t perform the act (snorting/iv/etc). Careful &lt;3

				Yeah oxycodone/blues, heroin, hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, codeine, methadone, all are opiates/opioids and work through the same mechanism of action basically.

				Daaaaaaaamn motek!&nbsp; Good to see you in the newb forum.&nbsp; You are one of the primary reasons I started posting.&nbsp; You don&#039;t take shit from anyone and you point out shit that is fucked up.<br /><br />And on topic.&nbsp; Opiates will get you eventually.&nbsp; You can only play with the fire for so long before you get burned.&nbsp; I think the same applies the meth and amph.&nbsp; Except for some reason people don&#039;t get too addicted to adderall.... I guess they&#039;re too smart for that eh?
