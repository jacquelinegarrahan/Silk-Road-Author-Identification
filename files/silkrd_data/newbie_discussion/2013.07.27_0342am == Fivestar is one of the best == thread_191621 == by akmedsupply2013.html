				Their is a very good supplier named fivestar in the H forums and just wanted all to know she is a super person and one of the most kind vendors on the road. i was reading in the H forum and some guy name karwat or some shit like that really screwed her around and she has been banned and i dont know if its permanent or just a few days but i just wanted to say to this karwat guy you are a coward as you should have just let that stuff go and not reported your dealings to silk road. I mean if you had been ripped off or something fine but being called a scammer for your actions and you go report it well my friend that is the makings of one fine SNITCH if you ask me so i cant put post in the HERO1n forums yet as i dont have 50 post but if any sellers see this i would stay clear of the guy as he really messed up alot of things for alot of people as fivestar is one of the best!!! just wanted to give my opinion and thats it in a nutshell!!!!<br />ak

				Bravo akmedsupply2013. I have dealt with fivestar and know her to be above and beyond many other vendor of H on SR. We&#039;ve lost a good vendor to a questionable &quot;infraction&quot; of the rules. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested go to Rumor Mill, to H3roin vendors then the posts from the last few days concerning this. Sounds like another vendor trying to eleminate some competition. <br /><br />Sounds like SR admin was used to take her down for the &quot;possiblity&quot; she &quot;might&quot; go outside SR. She didn&#039;t go outside the system to do any business, she said she would talk about it. Careful what you say the SR thought police are watching!!!!<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t sound like a &quot;FREE MARKET&quot; to me.<br /><br />Hope she goes to Atlantis or BMR, so will I.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />kahn<br /><br />

				Great chick, great vendor. When i&#039;ve gone through the hassle of getting to 50 posts I&#039;ll be relaying a message for everyone to interpret literally. <br /><br />fun, time to count.
