				I orderer the HCl&nbsp; Mescaline on Silkroad about 1gr.<br /><br />Whats the best way to use it and the recommended dosage.<br /><br />I was looking everywhere online to find infos about Dosage and use of Mescaline <br />some sites say between 200-300 mg others say 500mg for a heavy trip.<br /><br />If somebody could help me out would be cool.<br /><br />Also if Mescaline is used orally I thought I fill it in Pills and swallow it, 1 can fit in 250mg in 1 pill so i thought i use 1 and pop the 2nd if i feel its not enough.<br />Can I also pure it in some water and drink it??

				First, i&#039;d do an allergy test to be sure your not getting something that isn&#039;t mescaline. Theres a ton of different phens you could mix up with cuts and call it mescaline.<br /><br />I take mescaline, dissolved in a shot glass of water. Its the most bitter, revolting thing you can drink (save for ayahuasca mabey, or cactus tea), but its easy to get down and chase with some friut juice. Caps always got stuck in my throat, and i like to drink it anyway,<br /><br />First time with mescal, i&#039;d go with 2mg/lb of body weight. For me, thats ~300mg. Thats a good solid medium dose, 500mg is pretty heavy, at least for me, and is going to be a 12-16hr trip. But its up to you really, its not something that will mess you up with a high dose llike acid, shrooms, etc if your unprepared, but not to be taken lightly either. <br /><br />depending on your bodyweight, i&#039;d say 2mg/lb for a medium dose, 2.5mg/lb for a medium-strong dose, or 3mg/lb for a good strong dose. For me, thats around 400-500mg. <br /><br />Have fun, drink plenty of water, know your drug interactions, and be safe.<br /><br />Mescaline is someting special, you&#039;ll have a great time if you are properly prepared and in the right set/setting.<br /><br />

				I took 1 pill with 250 mg yesterday and about 3 hours into the trip i took another 250mg.<br />was my first time on mescaline but we had a great time, i kind of missed the hallozinations but all in all the trip was colorfull and lasted about 10 hours.<br /><br />Im not overwhelmed though because I expected it to be a bit different but yes will do it again
