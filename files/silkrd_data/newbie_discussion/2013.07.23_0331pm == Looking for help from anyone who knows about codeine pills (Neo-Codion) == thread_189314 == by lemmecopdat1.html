				Hey guys, first time poster!<br /><br /><br />I recently bought some codeine pills because they were relatively cheap, but they are neo-codion pills and I&#039;m kind of worried about the other ingredients in them. It has a codeine salt (codeine camphosulfate), but also sulfogaiacol and an extract of grindelia. Im not sure I could do a simple CWE on it, and I have no idea what taking several of these pills could do (they&#039;re only 20 mg of codeine each) but I was wondering if you guys knew of an extraction I could do or if I&#039;m screwed.<br /><br />Thanks a lot

				i don&#039;t have an opiate tolerance, but i know sulfagaiacol is an expectorant and i imagine taking 4-5 of these pills (the last time i did codeine i did like 80-100 mg) might have some shitty side effects.

				Did some research and supposedly sulfogaiacol isn&#039;t too soluble in alcohol... do you guys know if codeine camphosulfate is soluble in alcohol or are only certain types soluble??

				Both the other ingredients are expectorants which make the body produce phlegm <br />There is a way to extract codeine from pills but unless you have 200 tablets its not worth the time or energy
