				Hey everyone I wanted to say hi and to see if there would be demand for my products.<br /><br />So far what I have seen is mainly Afghani goods and if there is any China White it&#039;s expensive @ $500 p/g in AUS and $80+ p .25g in Canada and USA.<br /><br />I have access to all three: Afghan Brown, China White and Blue Magic.<br /><br />When I get my vendor account if I decide in investing in one then I will be offering either the China White or Blue Magic or maybe both depending on demand.<br /><br />From Canada to you anywhere. <br /><br />Small: 0.25, 0.50, 1g<br />Big: 14g, 28g+<br /><br />Will be creating custom listings for everyone as I see that a lot of vendors are very strict on this and will offer samples again if I open an account.<br /><br />These are the prices and all depending it could be more or less, but after looking at the listings available I would be the cheapest with same quality or better:<br /><br />(Showing 1g and 28g as examples)<br /><br />1g $250<br />28g $5600 (Less depending on volume and how frequent orders are made)<br /><br />Keep in mind that I&#039;m not gonna step on the h at all just a simple flip..if you wanna step on it that&#039;s your thing..not mine.<br /><br />Let me know what you guys think positive and negative, negative feedback is good for me then I know what to fix till perfection.<br />

				Yes, we can always use more H vendors with good product.&nbsp; Once you open your vendor account, announce it over on the h3r01n vendor&#039;s thread on the rumor mill board.&nbsp; Best way to bring in sales with a bang is to send out some .2+ samples to regulars on that thread.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve got an amazing product, word will spread VERY quickly and you&#039;ll start seeing orders really quickly.&nbsp; Most of us over there are daily users who spend 100s, even 1000s a week.&nbsp; That&#039;s who you want to get the word to.<br /><br />I&#039;d LOVE to review a sample when you get up and running.&nbsp; Let me know if you&#039;d be so kind.&nbsp; ;) Thanks and good luck!

				So would it be best to be in the heroin thread and product offer thread? Once I get 50 posts of course..<br /><br />Thank you for all of your advice and comments I&#039;m going to check back within a couple of hours and see where we are at but it looks like I&#039;m leaning towards opening a vendor account.<br /><br />Is there a lot of bulk purchasers from Canada, USA and AUS even abroad?

I am searching for bulk .. if you call a 1/4 at a time bulk..&nbsp; most vendors seem to do only 1 g at a time, the buyers for the most part want ontime delivery than anything else. You would do a lot better at 200/g with a domestic partner.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think your h will do well at that number and have to cross the border which equals delays which will equal ornery less than 5/5 ratings...&nbsp; just saying just guessing.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you can remember screen name, message me I&#039;ll jump in a give ya go!&nbsp; H vendor #7 in 2 months arrives tomorrow.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t found the go to guy yet.&nbsp; .&nbsp; other than for small amount personal.&nbsp;
