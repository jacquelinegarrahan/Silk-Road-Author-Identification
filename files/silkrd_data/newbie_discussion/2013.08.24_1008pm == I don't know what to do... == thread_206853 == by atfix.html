				Basically i did a deposit in an exchange (bitstamp) and i am waiting for my cash to come. The problem is that i went on the site on both tor and normal browser. I was going to mix the bitcoins i would receive and then do the stuff i wanted.<br /><br />Now i am unsure about the situation. Is it possible that LE could come to me and ask why i bought bitcoins for?<br />Should i just withdraw my money back to my bank account and start again but with localbitcoins this time for the perfect anonimity?<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				Most people buying BTC are not doing it to come hear. Just relax and go about business as normal the LE is not going to come looking for you for buying BTC.

				Na I wouldn&#039;t worry hey :)<br /><br />I think you&#039;re making yourself paranoid. It&#039;s not illegal to buy/sell Bitcoins anyway, or use TOR for that matter

When your SR wallet receives your BTC, you can trash the address and make it seem as if you&#039;re just sitting on it as an investment even when you spend it. LE won&#039;t be able to trace it past the one time it was sent to an address.
