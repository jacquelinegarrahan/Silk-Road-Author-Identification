				Saw this today and instantly thought about the Road.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) â€” A Massachusetts woman has sued FedEx, claiming the company mistakenly sent her a package containing seven pounds of marijuana, then gave her address to the intended recipients, who later showed up at her door.<br /><br />Maryangela Tobin of Plymouth said in the suit filed Feb. 12 that by disclosing her address, the company violated state privacy laws and put herself and her children in danger.<br /><br />&quot;I feel like the safety of my daughters and myself was invaded and it makes things complicated,&quot; she told WBZ-TV. &quot;I walk into my house first every time, my kids don&#039;t.&quot;<br /><br />Tobin said she thought the package was a birthday present for her daughter, because when she opened it, she found candles, pixie sticks and peppermint. There was also something she thought was potpourri, but it was marijuana.<br /><br />Tobin said that about an hour later, a man knocked on her door looking for the package, while two men sat in a vehicle in her driveway, waiting. She said she didn&#039;t have it, and bolted and slammed the door. Tobin claims FedEx gave out her address, which led the men to her home.<br /><br />Police made an arrest, but Tobin said now she&#039;s worried about retribution.<br /><br />Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx said it doesn&#039;t comment on pending lawsuits.<br /><br />Clear Net Warning:<br />http://news.yahoo.com/mass-woman-sues-fedex-over-marijuana-delivery-135742401.html

				SR or not, that is a dumb way to do a drop.&nbsp; I would be interested in following that case to see how it evolves....&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder if it turns out to be something from sr, if le will try to tighten down on things?&nbsp; This woman clearly doesnt have a clue what is going on with the package.&nbsp; I would say this buyer has put a lot of people and things at risk by doing that.

				I seen this story, made me laugh because I thought the same thing at first but then I remember drug mail ordering has been going on for a long time so who knows, I just hope the guys that showed up to obtain their package didn&#039;t mean to send it to that address, I hope it was just a very unfortunate mistake because if not I have to say that was very stupid if it was intentional.

				Don&#039;t use FEDEX for drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure FEDEX is at fault here though.&nbsp; Seems like an incredibly stupid drop instead.

				Here is a story,<br /><br />Small town and small post office .&nbsp; A friend agrees to ship. 1/4 lb of skunk from Vancouver to the east side of Canada by post.&nbsp; Sounds easy enough right? He sends it by snail mail and no idea when it will arrive .&nbsp; The post office calls and says come down here and pick up this damn package now!&nbsp; It stinks so bad, we had to leave it outside .&nbsp; It&#039;s outside by the door when you get here.&nbsp; &nbsp;WTF? <br /><br />&nbsp;Buddy goes there and sure enough the box is outside in front of the post office. . . Except now there is a group of elderly people standing around the box asking each other who its for, why its outside and what could possibly be I it that makes it smell so bad?&nbsp; They were all perplexed and confused and couldn&#039;t think of what may be in it among themselves !&nbsp; Buddy goes in and signs for it .&nbsp; now everyone is inside the post office and buddy says its just Indian medicine a skunk oil used for ceremonies and says&nbsp; thanks and grabs it and walks off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes , small towns and innocent people are really clueless and even helpful. <br /><br />

				Hahah oh my, crazy story. Highly doubt it&#039;s SR related though. I would have no idea what to do in that situation if I was that lady...

				Many things in this story were done out of advised protocol... so I doubt it. I also agree the sender had major balls trying to retrieve the package.

				I think, more and more people are using postal service to traffic drugs.<br /><br />It&#039;s the biggest leak in drug history.<br /><br /><br />People who starting doing this 50 years ago, are just genius in freedom world :D<br /><br /><br />

				This is obviously someone ordering to that address knowing it wasn&#039;t their address but knowing they could watch for the fedex delivery then just go and ask for it at the door. It&#039;s just unlucky they&#039;d opened it first. Typical fucking American suing fedEx (sorry American&#039;s I don&#039;t usually generalize that badly). Of course they didn&#039;t give out her address, what a retarded case that is. I hope the judge throws it out instantly. It&#039;s one of the oldest tricks in the book.<br /><br />Why the fuck didn&#039;t she give it to them anyway, until she found out it was weed (surely hash btw?) then it could just have been a genuine mistake and she was deliberately stealing mail. She&#039;s the crook.<br /><br />Still 7lbs in one package. That&#039;s not silk road.
