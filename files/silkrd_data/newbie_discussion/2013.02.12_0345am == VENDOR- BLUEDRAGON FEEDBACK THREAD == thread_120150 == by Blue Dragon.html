				Well, they went into vacation mode or something, but just encase they come back. <br /><br />I ordered some carmels. I ate two of them and it got me pretty buzzed. I am a weekend smoker. So my tolerance isn&#039;t super high, but not low either. <br /><br />I was buzzed for about 6-8 hours on two. it was a low level buzz, very functional felt very good. So when they return, I wouldn&#039;t hesitate ordering. They also tossed in a lolli, which I haven&#039;t tried yet.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t chew the carmels, let them melt in your mouth and swallow, they taste excellent. but they do have small bit of sugar that gathers and you will get a &quot;crunch&quot; if you chew them, which may put you off. <br /><br />But, shipping was fast, very well packaged.

				Vendor: Blue Dragon<br />Edible: Lollipop<br /><br />Image Link:&nbsp; http://postimg.org/image/xeaskdoe5/21ed4e2d/<br /><br />Color/Appearance&nbsp; (9.5/10) <br />The color and shape are set and molded so clean ! You can actually the mold prints in the solidity of the candy itself. Has a nice criss-cross pattern and is a nice light greenish dark blue color.<br />A raspberry color for sure ! The Candies are also individually wrapped and sealed in its packs and also has a twisty bread wire for each candy. Nicely set and has a gold foil bread wire, to make it pop out so elegant<br /><br /><br />Bag Appeal and Package:(9.5/10) <br />You can tell its a nice professional type of candy, and not like them down the street home made candies that people walk down the street selling like home made candy apples or like them lil&#039; pineapple bread shapes and stuff.<br />This has everything you look for in quality of a store bought factory type of good, and Blue Dragon takes it there.<br />&nbsp;<br />Cooking Job:(9.5/10)<br />I can&#039;t per say i know how it was cooked and made, but i can tell the process Blue Dragon uses is very optimal and has all his warez look professional ! It has me question if he own his own bake shop or candy machine to be spinning sugar and making corn fructose concoctions infuses oils and cannabis like a real pro !<br />Each of his edibles has its look and shape and container. It just goes to show he is a cooking master when it comes to these tasty treat to eat !<br /><br />Freshness:(9.5/10) <br />Fresh within Fresh within Fresh ! That&#039;s from the seals down to the last layer from taking out of bags, and it still has its own candy and edible package for each of his products<br /><br />Feel:(9.5/10) <br />Extremely hard pressed candy, nothing chips and it all holds its very strong foundation within the lollipops handle. Its all infused to perfection and can&#039;t be noted as some home made candy like your neighbor the raspa seller makes , no way , this is all in a class of its own.<br /><br />Smell:(9/10) <br />The Candy has its smell, and you can pull the oil out with a lil&#039; hint of ganja but the raspberry flavor encases it well and its pretty much left to only a master of edibles or a heavy everyday smoker to figure out whats inside<br /><br />Buzz:(9/10) <br />I ate one candy during lunch without eating anything prior. i had to do a plate sale for 4-20 to raise money for my bro who is locked up on gun charges, well anyway. i scarfed a candy back like it was nothing and within about 2 hours after noticing i was sun burnt. I decided to go take a shower and when i did, i started noticing i was gracefully just doing everything i had to that day, and felt no inhibition from anxiety or nothing, it was a real nice clean buzz, and had me felling fuzzy at least a good 2 hours with a nice mild sensation in my body, not strong but you can feel it there you can notice by how you just regard things and interact,you can feel it lingering noticeably as you function throughout your day, i was so focused i had to stop and think after a while to remember why i was just breezing by the day, and remembered i had ate nothing but a lollipop candy. That&#039;s how that short term memory was affected ,lol, really good product buzz for about 2 hour peak and a mellow 4 hour total drift on the come down <br />&nbsp;<br />SR vendor profile :&nbsp; <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/78f3f489cf<br /><br /><br />

				Vendor: Blue Dragon<br />Edible: Kick Azz Brownie<br /><br />Image Link:&nbsp; http://postimg.org/gallery/akr8poxu/062faa6d/<br /><br />Color/Appearance&nbsp; (9.5/10) <br />Super nice looking brownie, talk about fancy ! was layered in <br />its own box for protection and individually wrapped for <br />maximum flavor lock and product protection. The piece itself <br />was made out of premium gourmet ingredients like premium expensive Ghiradelli- Choclo-Mixes, and if u know like i know, you get those fancy chocolate like at MACY&#039;S or like fine retailers out there at malls or gift centers.If i can name these babies, they would be called Ghiradelli-Ganja Premium Peanut Butter-Cup Brownies. Imagine trying to say that five times fast<br /><br />Bag Appeal and Package:(9.5/10) <br />As a an edible fanatic i really like eating anything and everything that has some marijuana in it, but when i got a chance to review and work with blue dragons products i was blown away by sheer professionalism in the edibles category. Every product was dispensed and set in its own container aside from the regular seals and packaging.I can&#039;t say it&#039;s perfect and can probably only improve from here, but Blue Dragon has his edibles on a factory production line because its that unbelievable !<br />&nbsp;<br />Cooking Job:(9.75/10)<br />The brownie was perfect and moist nothing burnt and not hard edges from pan removal I&#039;m talking super saucy and soft.<br /><br />Freshness:(9.5/10) <br />The care and patience put into packing everything together and precisely from the beginning insured this product vitality easily surpassed my expectations. I can&#039;t say anything is perfect so I&#039;m eager to see improvement on something that is practically already perfect. Now that&#039;s the challenge<br /><br />Feel:(9.5/10) <br />My touch was soft and pliable and not firm , the first bit i took was chewy and super good, like a real factory packaged pastries from say like lil&#039; Debbie Snacks with its lil&#039; seal down to its own lil&#039; paper structure within the package and contents that are used to contain the product<br /><br />Smell:(9.5/10) <br />You can barely smell the ganja in the oil. or budder, I&#039;m not sure, but you can&#039;t barely even notice it, from the premium chocolate used, it basically undetectable unless your a an everyday user, and even then you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell apart the peanut butter and chocolate coating over the medical used.<br /><br />Buzz:(9.75/10) <br />First time i had an edible really sit me down ! I felt in about 1 hour and half when i noticed my eyes just drop down and stay locked in a squint mode, then i did a self check in the mirror and to my surprise, look like i was frying off some shrooms or something,because i was stuck and in wonderment off a psychedelic state. I promise this was so therapeutic its not even funny , for the first time i almost kinda got scared of a trip from weed, thinking i had felt it all before and all <br />there is to know about weed, but in the edible game, its a whole different set of rules, and is not even like smoking at all ! It sets in like a full blown body high and has some trippy effects to my perceiving vision and small color tone shifts and thought patterns. I really have a new found respect for edibles, because i really truly felt they didn&#039;t work on me, and now i know its due to the process used and skill mastered for a real true product to be authentically useful because with Blue Dragons brownie i was fully baked for about 4 hours strong and had sleep !<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />SR vendor profile :&nbsp; <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/78f3f489cf<br /><br /><br />REVIEW THREAD:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120150.msg874881<br />
