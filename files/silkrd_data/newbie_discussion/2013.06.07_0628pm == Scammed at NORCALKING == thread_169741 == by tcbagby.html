			<dd class="postbody">
				Last Friday I placed an order with NORCALKING, an A rated weed supplirr here on Silk Road.&nbsp; They promise shipping by 11am next day, priority mailing of the goodies, and encourage their customers to be sure and email them with any questions, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I didn&#039;t receive my order, when I went to their page and checked my order, it said it was being &quot;processed.&quot; I emailed then twice and didn&#039;t hear anything from them.&nbsp; I tried to contact SR support and didn&#039;t hear anything.&nbsp; Finially I went to the NORCALKING forum address and received the following from them. <br /><br />First message:&nbsp; Claimed I was being too pissy (maybe I was)<br /><br />Second message: Said my order was shipped Monday, June 3rd. And they never promised to ship by 11am next day, and although I paid them for priority shipping, they didn&#039;t send small orders that way.<br /><br />Third Message:&nbsp; Claimed I emailed them and said not to send the order to my address (which I didn&#039;t), then said I haven&#039;t given them an address and they were holding my order until I did.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought the last was suspicious, since it was sent June 6th (yesterday), I mean,,, if they shipped my order Monday, how could they still have the order??? Then the last part of the message hinted that because I was being &quot;pissy&quot; they were going to keep my money and not ship anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am new at this.&nbsp; I thought SR was a terrific idea, with built in protections for customers, but my experience indicates these folks do not have it together.&nbsp; Buyer beware.&nbsp; My advise: Be careful here, and definitely avoid NORCALKING.&nbsp; They will rip you off.<br />

				Not realizing that this message was from you, didn&#039;t think anything about it for a few days until I realized we hadn&#039;t received a new address &amp; then saw your username on it . . . .<br /><br />Here is the very first message you sent us on SR<br /><br />tcbagby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hety bro please DO NOT SEND the order I placed with you to the address I sent. I will give you a new address to send it to in 2-3 days. Please tell me if you have already sent it to the address I gave you.<br />This is the order: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/632f6aa6a5<br />Sorry for the hassle bro, I fucked up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s why you haven&#039;t received it . . .<br /><br /><br />NCK

				In addition to NCK&#039;s response above I would like to add you were NOT scammed by anyone so please edit the title of this thread as you are making unsubstantiated accusations that could hurt a vendors business.<br /><br />At the very worst your order was not processed as fast as you would have liked and it would appear to be a valid reason for that happening.<br />

				Just got back to see this response;<br /><br /><br />on: Today at 06:34 pm From: tcbagby<br />Dude,<br />Why don&#039;t you just mail my order and we bury the hatchet - otherwise I will&nbsp; will go nuclear on your biz.&nbsp; I have plenty of time to kill.&nbsp; what do you say?&nbsp; expansion is better than contraction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So we responded to him with what actually is a thought I had that is starting to make more sense because he has done all communication since being unhappy in through the forums and tormail;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Did your account get phished? is that why you have not contacted us directly from SR?<br /><br />It sounds like maybe you got phished &amp; they took your info &amp; saw your recent order &amp; sent us the message from your account to have us hold off sending the package until we got a better address . . .&nbsp; which we did.&nbsp; I re-reading some of what you have said, it looks to us like what has happened&nbsp; Can you let us know what happened?&nbsp; We did cancel the order so your money would have been back in your account, but you would not know that the order had been canceled or that your money was back.(if you could not log in)<br /><br />I think this is all been a phished up situation!<br /><br />NCK<br /><br /><br />Hopefully this is what happened &amp; we can get it figured out!<br /><br />NCK

				I started ordering from NorCalKing a few weeks ago, every order I&#039;ve placed has always arrived within two days, and always overweight. It&#039;s gotten to the point where I don&#039;t even bother trying to get weed locally anymore as you can&#039;t really beat NCK&#039;s service. I think NCK is one of the best and most honest vendors on the road. <br /><br />With that being said...<br /><br />NCK&#039;s shipping service is flawless.<br />Any order that doesn&#039;t reach its intended destination I would imagine is very likely a result of an error on the customers end.<br />tcbagby, your account either got phished and someone rerouted your order, or you are just a flat out liar.<br /><br />Just my two mbtc.

				Here is the rest of the story.<br /><br />tcbagby placed an order with us on Fri May 31 after we finished processing orders for the day.&nbsp; We usually send orders out on Saturdays as well, but for only the 3rd time in the last year, we took Sat off.<br /><br />Monday morning while we were still processing orders we received a message from tcbagby&#039;s SR account stating;<br /><br />tcbagby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hety bro please DO NOT SEND the order I placed with you to the address I sent. I will give you a new address to send it to in 2-3 days. Please tell me if you have already sent it to the address I gave you.<br />This is the order: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/632f6aa6a5<br />Sorry for the hassle bro, I fucked up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />So we replied back that he caught us just in time we would wait.&nbsp; We put it on our &quot;pending&quot; shelf &amp; forgot about it. <br /><br />Wed the 5th we receive a pm from the forums from him but written as if he thought he was contacting SR Customer Service!<br /><br /><br />I sent an order to them on Friday, May 31st and paid for priority shipping.&nbsp; I expected the order to go out that day, or at least by 11 am the next day as they advertise.&nbsp; That was six days ago.&nbsp; when I checked the status of my order it says &quot;processing.&quot;&nbsp; I think the only thing that is being &quot;processed&quot; is my bitcoin I sent them.&nbsp; I have tried several times to get in touch with them, and no answer.&nbsp; Also, I can&#039;t log on to silkroad now my original name and password info, and have to open a new account with a new name and password to gain access.&nbsp; This is fast looking like a scam to me. <br /><br />Before I go postal and start spreading the word on the internet about them AND silkroad I thought I would&nbsp; try this.&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND MY ORDER OR REFUND MY BITCOIN <br /><br /><br />We responded back to him after looking in the log book which showed that order was processed on Mon, (not recognizing his username) (we get between orders &amp; messages 300 - 400 usernames per week, so can&#039;t remember everything)&nbsp; so we let him know that his order didn&#039;t go out until Mon, so hold onto his pants!<br /><br />Then he pm&#039;s us again on the forum;<br /><br /><br />All you had to do was respond to my emails.&nbsp; To charge what you do for priority shipping, then wait until Monday to ship my order without notifying me is poor customer follow-up.&nbsp; You could have sent it first class for a hell of a lot less. <br /><br />But I am glad you did ship my stuff and no hard feelings.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good I will order on a regular basis from you.&nbsp; Understand this is my first time doing this and ripoffs do occur. <br /><br /><br /><br />To which we responded that we have not yet received any communication this week from him, maybe he sent it to our backup Tormail email address which had been down, &amp; that&#039;s where he had sent it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Send my order or refund my money.&nbsp; This is my second email to you. I<br />placed the order last Friday and paid you for priority shipping.<br />This is feeling like a scam and if it is you won&#039;t get away with it. I<br />will make sure everyone on the internet hears about you.&nbsp; If its not a<br />scam you really need to beef up your customer service.<br /><br /><br />So we decided to cancel his order &amp; let him figure out that he was the one who screwed everything up later.<br /><br />Then later Wed afternoon, we looked at the pending order on the shelf &amp; realized it was his order that had been asked for us to hold until he got us a new address.&nbsp; <br /><br />We tried to let him know that it might not be coming now that we realized the rest of the story &amp; we had been holding it waiting for a new address.&nbsp; He responded with a few more unkind messages &amp; told us to send it with tracking or he would send a message to every SR member that we were scammers.<br /><br />This was his last pm to us from the forum;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;tcbagby<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Newbie<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Posts: 8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Karma: +0/-2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [thank] [discourage]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View Profile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Email<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal Message (Offline)<br /><br />Scumbags<br />« Sent to: NorCalKing on: June 09, 2013, 07:32 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br /><br />Check your messages on tormail.org for an update,&nbsp; I added three new forums regarding your shitty service, check them out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll add a few more this evening.<br /><br />Send my order USPS first class, with a tracking number.&nbsp; &nbsp;Until you do I will continue spreading the word about your scam service on the SR Forum. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We finally think we know how it got him all confused . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;He is a n00b &amp; an old Viet Nam vet that may be missing or is on other medication which would clear up some of the reasons he doesn&#039;t get what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; <br /><br />We believe he registered and got the order in, but then forgot the url, &amp; when he searched to find SR again he ended up on a phishing link which there are still 1 or 2.&nbsp; Since he couldn&#039;t get in he couldn&#039;t message us &amp; eventually pmed us on the forums.&nbsp; Meanwhile whoever fished him logged in to his account &amp; saw the fresh order, messaged us to hold off until we were sent a new address.&nbsp; His messages have not been read since Mon morning when we responded back to him &amp; we sent a couple others . . . none have been read.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don&#039;t think he even knows what being fished is all about &amp; may have forgotten how he got on to SR to begin with.<br /><br />So he hasn&#039;t been on his account to see that there is no order, &amp; his coin would be back in his account which he adamantly deny&#039;s getting his money back.<br /><br />We sent him another message to log back into his account &amp; then he could read the message that was sent to us from his account on Mon asking us to hold the order, &amp; then see that there is no longer an order &amp; he has his bitcoin in his account, but we&#039;re not holding our breath, he believes we were trying to screw him, so he&#039;s out to get us come hell or high water!<br /><br />So since he intends to spread his &quot;cheer&quot; around the forum &amp; not listen to reason, we thought we would give people the WHOLE story.<br /><br /><br />NCK<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
