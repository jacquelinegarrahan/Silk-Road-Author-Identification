				&nbsp;Hey, I have a drug test coming up very soon. I passed the first one with dog urine, but they are going to give me a second one. Im not sure if they are going to search me or not. I was wondering if there are any detox drinks or masking agents that actually work. The only thing I have in my system is suboxone (buprenorphine). The test is an ez screen medtox 11 panel test (clearnet warning) http://www.medtox.com/ProductDevice_CupDevicesWithAdulterant_CriminalJusticeRehabDevices_CupDevices.aspx<br />I&#039;ve already searched the boards and couldnt come up with anything. This test is for my job. And don&#039;t make any comments about quitting because I dont have time for that.<br /><br />

				I went to a GNC or a Vitamin Shoppe and asked them for detox pills for a drug test and they directed me to some you take like a day before the drug test. It worked, I passed. <br /><br />If you have a little more time...depending on what drugs you&#039;re taking, simply sweating a lot, drinking a lot of water and stuff should get a lot of things out of your system in a month or two.

				Suboxone is not on the normal panel for drug screens, you have to test specifically for Booper for it to show and that test is very expensive. Most likely they aren&#039;t shelling out the big bucks for a simple hire screening.

				So i ended up taking my dogs urine to work with me in a bottle. As soon as i got there they pulled out a drug test. I didnt have to go at the moment so they sat the test on the table. Me (being the sneaky person that i am) noticed the box of drug tests at the desk. I snatched one up, went to the bathroom and poured the dog urine in the cup. It registered clean so I poured the urine out and switched the test that now showed clean with the one on the desk. (keep in mind that there is a privacy tab that covers the panel). So I then told them I am ready for my test. I took the cup (which was already registered as clean) and went in the bathroom while this old man watched my junk. I had to put one hand in the air while I held the cup with my other. As he eyeballed my nuts and licked his lips at the same time I asked him if it would be easier for him with my pants off. He didn&#039;t find it humorous. I stretched my penis out as far as it would go and asked him if it was good enough. ( he was looking for tubing, apparently someone tipped them off that I had been using a bottle with a tube on it.) So I pissed in the cup. He took it out to my manager and she sat it on her desk to let it soak up. After five minutes she took the privacy strip off and to her surprise I was clean. But this wasn&#039;t going to happen in her world. Oh no. She looked it over very carefully, looking for anything she could get me canned with. Then she noticed the PH. it was slightly below average. I asked her if I passed and she said, &quot;Well its inconclusive, something is wrong with the ph.&quot; I said, &quot; well this is the third test I have taken in 2 days and I have passed every single one.&quot; Then she replied,&quot; well who&#039;s to say you couldn&#039;t have got a masking agent at food city next door and slipped it in here.&quot; I was then informed that I had to take another test in 2 hours and If i couldnt change the ph level of my urine i was fired. So i told them that I was tired of being harassed over drug tests and that I passed all three of them. I quit. It was apparent that She wanted me gone in the first place. Was it because I wouldnt give her the dick. Was it because I wouldn&#039;t let her pick me up in the mornings. We will never know. But a word of advice...Dog urine does work. <br /><br />The ph of my urine was a little off because I was taking AZO the day before. My original plan was to slip chlorine crystals in the cup before I urinated. But the dog urine worked fine IMHO. She just wanted me gone because she was scared i was gonna get her fired cause I know that she would piss dirty too.<br /><br />Peace and love

They not only do an instant panel test, but they also send it to a lab to get a thorough test done. It sucks because i can&#039;t take dog piss there and get away with it. They&#039;ll find out at the lab. The only option i could do is have a buddy piss in a cup for me and i would just have to keep it warm so the temperature would show as having 98 degrees or whatever. To me it&#039;s not worth it to try that, because a job is more important for me. I&#039;ll just give myself a week off before the test and drink lots of water and sweat it out.<br /><br />BTW: HOW DID YOU KEEP YOUR DOG&#039;S PISS WARM ENOUGH? I&#039;M ASSUMING THE CUP YOU USED HAD A TEMPERATURE STRIP ON IT.

				I have been urine testing for the State Board of Nursing for the past 3 years, at least twice a month, all the while being on suboxone.&nbsp; It has never shown up.&nbsp; And if ever you want to meet a group of people who want to find a way to bury you, it is any kind medical licensing state board.&nbsp; I&#039;m nearly done though, YAY.

				None of those over the counter cleansing products work.&nbsp; They&#039;re all gimmicks.&nbsp; Sure, they&#039;ll rid your body of some mycotoxins and such but not the crazy metabolites we&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; The very best thing to do is go cold turkey for a couple days, drink tons and tons of water.&nbsp; Make your piss clear.&nbsp; Then take some vitamin B2, riboflavin, or a B complex that has it in there.&nbsp; It&#039;ll turn your urine yellow.&nbsp; That way, they won&#039;t know you&#039;re diluted.&nbsp; I recommend this method to my patients all the time.&nbsp; Peace!

				If they aren&#039;t going to actually watch the piss come our of your dick (in some places, they can&#039;t by law), then substituting with QuickFix Synthetic Urine is the way to go.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it multiple times, and it passes intense hazmat urine tests.&nbsp; It comes with two handwarmers, like you might use when camping.&nbsp; First, before you leave the house, you put the quickfix in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to get it up to 98 degrees (there&#039;s a temperature guage on the side of the bottle).&nbsp; Then you shake the handwarmers to activate them, open them, and attach them to the bottle of quickfix with the provided rubber band.&nbsp; Then stick it in your crotch.&nbsp; It will hold the temp for about 6 hours or so.&nbsp; Alternately, you can buy the urinator, and pour quickfix into it.&nbsp; It keeps the temp using batteries instead of handwarmers.&nbsp; That quickfix is the shit.&nbsp; It&#039;s perfect in every way.&nbsp; The only way they could tell it was synthetic is if they did a DNA test on it, which is expensive and against the law to do without your consent.&nbsp; When I use it, I actually take TWO bottles with me, warmed up and ready to go.&nbsp; Just in case they spill the first one...OR if anything happens and they are suspicious and tell you to pee again in 2 hours, I would have another.&nbsp; It&#039;s never happened, but it&#039;s well worth the wasted $30.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Here&#039;s what you do. Get some powder at testclear.com. It&#039;s the stuff they use to calibrate the machines. As long as you are within the temperature reqts it is negative for any drug test.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t mess with Quick Fix, it has been identified and you could be busted. <br /><br />Testclear can ship next day if you need it fast. While you&#039;re waiting for it to arrive, get a 3 oz plastic bottle with a screw top. You mix the powder with water, then get it warm by wearing it down in your crotch area. Go to Walmart and get a jock strap, the pocket where the nuts protector goes will hold the bottle and your briefs go over them. <br /><br />They are not allowed to watch so don&#039;t worry, wear baggy pants and smile a lot.<br /><br />Any questions, let me know.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Quickfix has NOT been &quot;identified&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s ridiculous...and bullshit.&nbsp; Testclear contains nothing &quot;extra&quot; to differentiate it from other synthetic urine.&nbsp; You must work for them.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)
