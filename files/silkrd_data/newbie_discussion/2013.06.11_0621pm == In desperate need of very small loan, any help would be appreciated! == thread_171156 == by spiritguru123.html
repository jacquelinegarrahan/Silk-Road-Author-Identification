				I deposited $190 earlier expecting to get $176 in BTC. However due to BTC fluctuation and the slow processing of bitinstant I only recieved $171 when I intended to buy a $175 product. I am very upset at this predicament and can only hope some kind soul can lend me 0.04655btc to purchase this product. I will pay you back the $5 by next monday guaranteed plus interest. No bullshit, you have my word. Much love to all and I really hope somebody can help me out.<br /><br />SR name: Spiritguru123<br /><br />Thanks again for all your help guys!

				In my interpretation of karma the most good can be done by random acts of kindness, without rhyme or reason, <br />preferably for someone who has no chance of finding out who you are.&nbsp; All they need to know is that it happened.

				I rarely travel these forums so doubt I will get to 50 in the near future.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pity because there are some interesting conversations<br />but I guess they have these restrictions for some reason.

				if you middle click your mouse scroll, on the reply button, like 20-30 times let them load, on a spam to 50 thread, you can type the first captcha an a message.. copy the captcha, post the message. close the tab, in a new tab type a message, paste the old captcha. and press post.. repeat :) <br /><br />if it says &quot;your IP posted 0 seconds ago&quot; just close that tab an try again :P
