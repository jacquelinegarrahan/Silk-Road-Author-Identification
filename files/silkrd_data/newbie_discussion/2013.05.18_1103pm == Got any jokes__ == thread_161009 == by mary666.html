				a woman goes to the hospital to visit her husband after he has a heart attack. when shes walking down the halls she notices a man masturbating in one of the rooms. she find a doctor and says &quot;excuse me sir, theres a man masturbating in that room over there&quot;. the doctor tells her he has a serious disorder and if he doesn&#039;t have an orgasm every hour his balls will swell up, explode and die. the woman says &quot;oh that poor man&quot; and she keeps looking for her husband. in the next room she sees a nurse give a man a blowjob. she says &quot;doctor, theres a nurse giving a man oral sex in that room&quot; and the doctor tells her &quot;he has the same disorder but better health benefits&quot;

				Oh God... I used to work for a telemarketing company and we had to tell a shitty joke as part of our sales pitch. I&#039;ve got a slew of them.<br /><br />What&#039;s the difference between snowmen and snow-women?<br /><br />snow balls!<br /><br /><br />Why don&#039;t blind people go skydiving?<br /><br />It scares the hell out of the poor seeing eye dog<br /><br /><br />What&#039;s the perfect morning for a man?<br /><br />He wakes up... his son is on the wheaties box, his daughter is in the most recent issue of playboy... and his wife is on the back of the milk carton.

				Last night, I went to a nightclub. While there, I noticed an attractive girl, so I went over and asked if I could buy her a drink. She said yes, and when I gave it to her, she immediately called her boyfriend over and gave it to him.<br /><br />Now this kind of thing would usually annoy the hell out of me, but it was funny as fuck watching him drink that roofie.
