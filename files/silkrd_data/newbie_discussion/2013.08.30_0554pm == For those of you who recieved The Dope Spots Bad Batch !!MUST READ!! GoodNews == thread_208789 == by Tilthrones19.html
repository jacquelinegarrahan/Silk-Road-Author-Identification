				So I ordered a 4ball of his meth and unfortunately received his &quot;bad batch&quot;.&nbsp; I smoked like 2.5-3 grams of it in only a matter of a couple days.&nbsp; It can be smoked literally hours strait with barely any effect so I figured what the hell, I mine as well get rid of it because I sure as hell wasn&#039;t going to sell it to other people.&nbsp; I was frustrated, complained about the product.&nbsp; To my surprise, TDS had excellent communication and truly seemed apologetic for the mistake(apparently he got the stuff from a new guy when his normal supply was dry in order to keep the business going).&nbsp; He admitted to his mistakes, and we came to a reasonable resolution so that both parties were satisfied.&nbsp; I have no tolerance, and other people complained of this batch on the forums as well so I know am not alone.&nbsp; I decided to swallow down a decent sized rock, because why keep destroying my lungs with this garbage?&nbsp; It was roughly .1-.15, and I assumed it wouldn&#039;t do shit to me but boy was I wrong.&nbsp; I started jammin&#039; to some blues to pass time and make some sweet, sweet love to my lovely guitar.&nbsp; (BTW if you don&#039;t play an instrument, or the guitar specifically, you need to change that right now, lol, you will thank me in the long run.&nbsp; It&#039;s never too late people.&nbsp; Stevie Ray Vaughn started around ages 16-18 if I remember correctly, and look what he turned into.&nbsp; And that&#039;s just one of the many guitar gods our ears hear &amp; love so dearly.&nbsp; The tools necessary to learn this majestic instrument are right under your nose, and have been all along. Just hop on youtube and search for a good instructor that you like.&nbsp; FOR FREE.&nbsp; No need to blow $30 on a 30 minute guitar lesson by some stranger who could potentially know nothing more than the basic newbie chords.&nbsp; Take Marty Schwartz for examples, he did wonders for my friends and I.&nbsp; I could go on, but I&#039;ll quit rambling off topic, for the sake on my own sanity.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t tell already I am slightly addicted to the guitar, and the experience I just went through made me love it so so so much more.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll leave you with this; do or don&#039;t take my advice.&nbsp; I honestly could care less.&nbsp; Ignorance however, in this specific case is not bliss, in fact, it is sad and depressing.&nbsp; But only for you, because you will never really know music the way you should.&nbsp; Music changes lives people, I know it saved mine.)&nbsp; Anyway, I shit you not, it hit me like a ton of bricks.&nbsp; BOOM.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking on level I never would have imagined.&nbsp; It was fucking unreal.&nbsp; I got so lost in the music it seemed that hours went by as if they were seconds.&nbsp; People if you got this batch stop wasting it away in the glass dick.&nbsp; Throw some shards and motha fuckin&#039; spoon and chase that shit down with some milk.&nbsp; Then fasten your seat belts and prepare for takeoff.&nbsp; Hope this brightens someones day the way it did mine.&nbsp; Was honestly SO close to throwing the last of my ~.5-.7 stash away in the trash.&nbsp; Anyone ever experienced this before?&nbsp; Very interesting how this works.&nbsp; Cheers!!&nbsp;
