				Obviously im new here, and posting this in the newbie section, but it seems like there are nothing but scammers currently taking orders. Is this common here, and good vendors are very hard to come by or is it just bad timing and alot of scammers are coming a board?<br /><br />Im interesting in buying bulk in a few different areas, but there is no way I will send such large payments to any vendor at this time becasue it seems just way to sketch. <br /><br />Please provide your opinion of recent vendors. <br /><br />Are certain products prone to scammers? Vice Versa? Such as MDMA buyers getting scamed, and BUD buyers have better vendors?

				Just do your homework. Don&#039;t send some vendor $5,000 for your first purchase. Troll through reviews and read through the forums. Establish a rapport with a particular vendor by communicating with them and purchasing smaller quantities first. Then you&#039;ll feel more comfortable with the vendor, and on the chance your package gets lost, it&#039;ll be easier for you to defend yourself.

				So much noob in the OP...<br /><br />First of all, there are plenty of legit vendors who are only here to do honest deals. Like other people have said, read through the Rumor Mill extensively.<br /><br />Also, if you plan on making your first purchase a large bulk deal, you&#039;ll be the one looking &quot;sketch&quot;. Use common sense and place a few small orders first. You need to build a strong buying history.<br /><br />Most importantly, when you make your first purchases DON&#039;T EVER FINALIZE EARLY (FE).&nbsp; <br /><br />Find a vendor you want to make your first purchase from and read their ENTIRE vendor page. Do you see a section saying that they require FE? If you do, forget about that vendor for the time being. There are so many good vendors out there that you have reason to FE starting out. But what if you really like this vendor&#039;s product/prices/username? Too fucking bad. If you think it&#039;s acceptable to FE on your first order, be prepared to never see your drugs or BTC again. Just send the coin to me and save yourself the time and hassle.<br /><br />Moving on, now that you&#039;ve found a vendor who lists a smallish amount without requiring FE, you&#039;ll need to send the vendor a message. Just A MESSAGE, don&#039;t spam them with silly shit. You will be ignored. All you&#039;ve gotta say is something like this: &quot;Hi (vendors name here), I&#039;m a new customer just starting out and I have no buying history. I like how your listing looks and I&#039;d like to make my first purchase with you. Since I&#039;m just starting out, I want to stay in escrow only. I don&#039;t want to FE. Please let me know if we can do business. Thanks&quot;.&nbsp; If they say no, move on to another vendor. If they say yes, congratulations.<br /><br />This is all you have to do.&nbsp; It really is that simple.&nbsp; When messaging a vendor, keep it short and sweet. Type your shit out like you passed high school English.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be amazed at how much further you get by sounding polite and educated.<br /><br />Above all, don&#039;t be a fucking retard.

				Maybe. Maybe not. If you&#039;re new, looks like the best bet is to stick to sellers who do indeed sell to new users and have 100% feedback across over 300 sellers. While they might request FE as new users often act a fool and then trash their drug man&#039;s feedback, it&#039;d be really dumb for a seller to scam a new $50 buyer and risk alienating big repeat-order accounts.<br /><br />Make sure to use PGP if requested, affirm that your address is real, that you will contact prior to leaving feedback if there&#039;s any issue, and that you understand that you must FE immediately after receipt and that a 4 star rating is akin to giving your seller an F. Basically, make sure you know the rules and don&#039;t be a cunt.

				so &quot;thagoat&quot; says to NEVER finalize early.<br /><br />well, among the few sellers that sell from germany (i depend on local senders) quite some request FE if you are new (like less than 5 purchases f.e.).<br /><br />of course i could ignore those sellers, but that wouldnt leave me many.<br />some of those listed in the coke sellers quality thread in rumours are even listed among top 10 sellers (thus they are trusted sellers a.f.a.i.k.).<br />and even if their reviews seem to tell that they do send also on fe, they have (98) or similar, i should still not FE while i do my first 5 purchases ?<br /><br />i understand the risk i take by fe, <br />on the other hand, if for the first time i order from them, they seem trusted (yes, feedback could be fake, i know.), and i try only 1g C, i think the risk is acceptable, at least if you want to give it a try. of course i wouldnt iof the amount was higher, but such a little test, i think its ok (not with any seller, though).<br /><br />if i would generally reject FE, i would sort out quite some high rated sellers.<br /><br />on the other hand, only 1 out of 5 asked me to FE.<br />but this 1 is listed among the top 10 sellers (couple of month here, about 300 sales, (98)), so i agreed this time.<br />i hope next time he wouldnt ask me to FE.<br />if there is a next time.<br />which i hope (means i hope the quality is allright).<br /><br />at least this is my opinion (and i am a real newbie at SR).<br /><br />of course, if it was a bigger amount, then i also wouldnt fe.<br />but for that, i first have to find a vendor with good quality (and not only average or a little above average etc.).<br />how i wish i would ...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Not sure where you&#039;re located but as a rule I have only been using SR domestically. I would def say even without knowing international vendors/packages are way more of a risk then any domestic vendor could possibly be. I&#039;d stick with people who have 100% positive feedback, I&#039;ve only been on the road &#039;buying&#039; for a few months and it wasnt shit for me to get a vendor to fk with me on some weed. Not sure what your DOC is, good luck tho

				The only thing I go international for is indian pharmies, the prices are killer, shit fredthebaker has 500 2mg kpins for $190 shipped. There are some pretty decent vendors in that niche, its all about finding one that has a good relationship with local authorities and they sail through outbound customs.

				There are quite a few great vendors here,all one has to do is put a vendor&#039;s name in the search box on the main forum page and if anything sketchy is going on there will be someone who starts a thread on it. It is best to go with tried and true vendors and to never finalize early no matter how much of a great deal is tempting you.&nbsp;

				I only had successful transactions. I simply base my trust on the feedback system, the rumor mill, and on the communication with the vendors. Never finalized early, never was asked to do so, even when I had very little buyer history. Also, I am loyal: I will go back to a good seller with good product and good packaging. And they know this. Never did bulk orders though, but by now there are some vendors I would definitely trust for that.

				For people living and ordering outside of the US, I can understand why somebody would consider FE&#039;ing. There just aren&#039;t a lot of vendors for certain products in certain countries. I guess I should&#039;ve mentioned that my previous post mainly applies to Americans; it shouldn&#039;t have been such a blanket statement.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m still vehemently against FE&#039;ing. When you do a drug deal in real life and you&#039;re unfamiliar with the dealer, you wouldn&#039;t hand over your money without seeing the drugs first, right? When you FE, you&#039;re just handing over your money to the vendor and hoping that you get some drugs for it. The SilkRoad is a wonderful marketplace that provides the buyer with multiple levels of protection through feedback, the forums, and most importantly, the escrow system. This escrow system is what sets SR apart from shady dealers on the street corner. But when you FE, you&#039;re basically telling SR to fuck off and that you don&#039;t need them to look out for you. This is a choice that I would just never make.<br /><br />Regardless, choosing to FE is a personal decision based on personal circumstances. Just understand&nbsp; that under any circumstances, you will be fucked 99% of the time when something goes wrong and you&#039;ve already FE&#039;ed. There are multiple ways a vendor can make it look like your order was sent after you&#039;ve FE&#039;ed.<br /><br />If you FE, make sure you can afford to lose all of that money. Think long and hard.

				@ thagoat :&nbsp; &nbsp;i agree to your statements about FE completely.<br /><br />today even more, since i have an open order with a vendor where i (for the first time) did FE (since i only have 2 finished transactions yet with 4 new others open).<br /><br />i might have to add that i am in germany and i only take domestic sellers of C.<br />the first 2 transactions arrived, as it is normal, on the next business day.<br /><br />the sending that i did FE for (upon sellers request, sellers is among the trusted sellers as far as i understand) was ordered on<br />tuesday about 4 p.m., seller said it has been sent shortly after i FE on wednesday. that means it should arrive on thursday, but it didnt.<br />well, sometimes it takes 2 days, so no need to get nervous after 1 say.<br />now today is friday, means 2 days after it has been sent (according to seller), and it still did not arrive!<br /><br />usually, once a sending does not arrive after 2 business days, that means there is a problem.<br />of course there is still a chance, but since i did FE i am seriously concerned.<br /><br />sure, maybe the seller didnt send on the stated date, but a day later, or he threw in a postbox that was only to be emptied on the next day, or whatever reason else there may be.<br />only, it leaves a bad feeling, since in ~ 99% sendings arrive on the next business day in germany.<br />if it is not there after 2 business days,&nbsp; i worry.<br /><br />and so in the moment i really am not sure if it was a bad idea to FE.<br />of course, if i had rejected FE, the seller would have cancelled the transaction (i suppose), since i only have 2 finished transactions so far.<br />but since in germany there are not so many domestic sellers, this would have taken out a seller that is described as trusted.<br />that was the reason for me to give it a try.<br /><br />however, i will not do it anymore in the future.<br /><br /><br />in the us there seem to be quite some sellers, also in the netherlands and UK, but f.e. in germany i think there are usually 5-6 sellers of C active, some pretty regularly, and maybe another 4-5 that i saw that do not sell regularly (only occasionally).<br />of course i think there are more, which you see only occasionally, but if you look for a regular seller ...<br /><br />this is not much, and in such a situation, if one of the supposed trusted sellers requests FE for new buyers, you have to do it or sort this one out, which does not leave many.<br /><br />my hope is that there will be more domestic sellers in germany in the future.<br />(of course, i am only talking about the sellers of C, this is all about coke, it might be different when it comes to other dope).<br /><br />and now i hope that the FE&#039;d sending will arrive, but to be honest : i kind of doubt it.<br />however, there is still a little hope.<br /><br />but, even if it will arrive, i learned one thing : <br />i will not FE anymore. <br />it just costs too many nerves.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				ALWAYS stay in escrow, and go to a domestic vendor the first time.<br /><br />Buy small first, don&#039;t buy 2g heroin or coke. Read all the posts and reviews before you decide to buy. PM the vendor or a client of his and ask for details too.<br /><br />Encrypt your data.<br /><br />ENJOY!

				I have to agree with the idea that as long as you&#039;re patient, careful, and do your research, you will be fine.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member for about a month now and I haven&#039;t even made a single purchase yet because I&#039;m still doing research and saving money. I&#039;m glad I waited too because at one point I was up and ready to get a P.O. Box and buy some BTC. Then I noticed someone in the newbie forums saying to check out the &quot;Shipping&quot; threads.<br /><br />I went there and for the first time learned about controlled delivery, warning signs for packages, the details of overseas vs domestic shipping, and the uselessness of a P.O. Box, something that researched saved me from wasting my money on.<br /><br />After I learn some more and save some money, I&#039;m gonna buy some LSD for me, my friends, and some light selling for a festy :D
