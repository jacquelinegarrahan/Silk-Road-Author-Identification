				I&#039;m planning on heading out to a nature trail in my neighborhood. It&#039;s large and has a good area that has no people in it usually, but how safe is it to also smoke weed around hidden trees in the nature trail?

				Lol. <br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t make to much noise very safe, and fun. Don&#039;t walk to far, or make sure you bring a compass and know how to use it. Phone reception for maps also good .<br /><br />So many weirdos in the bush.. Make to much noise and they&#039;ll come say hi.

				Yes, nature trails can be awesome. However, psychedelics have a way of magnifying the little things, so there are some preparations you can take to make sure they stay awesome.<br /><br />Strangers (people not in your group) will probably freak you out a bit when tripping. And I don&#039;t mean yell and scream and run away, I mean fill your head with ego thoughts. In my experience, tripping around strangers has not affected the strangers at all; most people don&#039;t even notice that you are on drugs. Instead, your head is filled with thoughts of what those people think about you and other such social nervousness. And then it is just awkward.<br />Try to pick a place that not many other people will be there. Your group should stick together. Like respect1 said, avoid children.<br /><br />Bring water. Maybe some munchie food, but definitely water.<br /><br />Climb a tree.<br /><br />Take your time.<br /><br />Remember to sit down and rest at some point. <br /><br />Listen to the sounds of outside. As hard as you can.<br /><br />Glowsticks, unless you don&#039;t want extra attention. Glowsticks on strings for a good time.

				Great advice everyone. I will get most nervous when I hide what I think is very well and someone happens to see me...it is relatively mild dense forest, I would describe it.

				If you&#039;ve had shrooms before and know what to expect from them then I&#039;d suggest it would be awesome. The best times I&#039;ve tripped were all outdoors in different places. Most people don&#039;t care if they see some people smoking weed or whatever under some trees etc, this is 2013 drugs are everywhere in society. If you&#039;re in a group you&#039;ll probably feel pretty safe when you&#039;re tripping, and if you&#039;re alone you&#039;ll be too busy enjoying how fucking awesome all the plants are to really care about anything probably hehe.<br />Taking some water as mentioned by gr8ape is very important especially if the weather is warm. <br />Have fun!
