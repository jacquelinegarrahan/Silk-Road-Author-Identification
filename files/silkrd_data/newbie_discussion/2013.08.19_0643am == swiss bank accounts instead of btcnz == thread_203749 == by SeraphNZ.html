				i dunno bout u guyz but getting btcnz seems abit dodgy where im from. i kinda think government agencys pay attention to their currency changing hands and leaving the country. i would prefer to use a swiss bank account to do transactions because theyre sworn to privacy and it dusnt look so bad to have an offshore bank account. is there sum reason i dont of that this is used less?

				Just to be clear: this is a VERY bad idea! Switzerland will roll over on a moment&#039;s notice to requests from foreign governments. Not long ago their oldest bank was convicted on criminal charges in the US, paid a record fine and is not allowed to do business with any listed American companies. All because they helped American customers dodge the IRS. In many cases legally.<br /><br />Other countries have better records but all of them are compliant with international KYC banking regulations. I won&#039;t even bother naming these countries because if you just open up a bank account in your name then you&#039;re absolutely fucked. It&#039;s only a matter of time.<br /><br />You have to have a proper setup of offshore holdings in order to properly comply with the law. If you do then you can remain anonymous and conceal your money flows. The only problem with this is since Emperor Obama&#039;s police state FATCA law was passed many offshore banks refuse to even talk to Americans.<br /><br />This is a really tricky subject that could easily land you in jail for a while if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Stick to Bitcoin. Even with all the shit going on it&#039;s a lot safer. A LOT SAFER. Trust me on that.
