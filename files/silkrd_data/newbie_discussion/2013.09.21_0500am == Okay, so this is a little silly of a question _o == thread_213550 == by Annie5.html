				Okay so im taking a flight within the next week or two (usa to usa) Virginia to Oregon,,<br />and i was wondering if you guys had any advice on this,, <br />well its kinda embarrasing, but im opting out of the full body scan and am trying to get through with ten nintendos and a few xanax, in meee pussssy nomm nomm.. <br /><br />so anyway , what is the best way of going about this, can they detect latex like balloons or condoms if they run a xray wand over me and pat me down, i mean if i have it wayyy up there, close to the cervix..<br /><br />or should i use just a little baggie like those little ziplock baggies with silly things on them that i recieve in the mail (obviously would know by the bag they contained a little goodies)<br /><br />I mean what do you guys think, If i get caught im fucked, so im thinkin about holding off until i get to my cousins house in Oregon,, and then just get a po box and recieve them there,,<br /><br />but on the other hand I really would love a little xanax or a pressed pill to get me through the longgggggg day of flying and shit,,, <br /><br /><br />so whats you advice, anyones welcome to share,<br />Thank you for all you help :)<br /><br />-Annie

				Jesus, where do I meet chicks like you?!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Anyway... if you&#039;re opting out, I&#039;m thinking you should be fine.&nbsp; Those wands are just metal detectors.
