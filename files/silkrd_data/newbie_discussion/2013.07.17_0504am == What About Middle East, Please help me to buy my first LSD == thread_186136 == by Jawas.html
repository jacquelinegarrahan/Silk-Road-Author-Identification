				Just one quick recommendation:<br /><br />If I were you, I would use a buyer account with a different name from your forum account, since you&#039;ve put on the forums that it&#039;s likely the address you give to the vendor is your home address. (Or just edit that part out?)<br /><br />Might not matter so much, and the vendor might not be likely to search the forums for your name anyway, but just a thought.<br /><br />And for all I know, your buyer name IS different from your forum name.<br /><br />But do read that guide in its entirety&nbsp; :D

				unfortunatly the guide doesnt answer all your questions regarding middle east... I will give you some tips and what your getting yourself into.<br /><br />A. get a po box, you have too, without it dont even bother about ordering anything, the guide goes into detail as to why you should use the po box<br /><br />B. dont choose vendors that ship fedex (i believe fedex will make you sign for packages)<br /><br />C. in middle east (depending where you are) there is no such thing as control delivery, if they find things they will come after you weather you sign for it or not. with that being said, middle eastern customs arent as strict other countries.<br /><br />D.its hard getting bitcoins from middle east, have you looked into that yet?<br /><br />E. last point is what you really need to worry about, if you do get caught you could be goign away for a looooonnnngg time, they have zero tolerance regarding drugs. I remember reading an article online couple years ago stating that a guy got arrested at dubai airport for having marijuana residue on his shoe (this is a rough story i dont have the actual details).<br /><br />I personnally would be very cautious if im ordering anything illegal to middle east. Good luck hope this helped
