				Hi SR!<br /><br />I am a buyer with over 20 purchases, $700+ spent, and %7 refund. Recently I ordered a small amount of GHB from Ampsterdope. I was unaware of his FE policy when I initially ordered, so I planned to cancel as soon as possible. I was not given the chance since Ampsterdope marked my package as &#039;in transit&#039; before I could contact him or cancel. My transaction with Amsterdope was fishy, and I do not believe he sent the package, but there is nothing I can do but leave a review and avoid this vendor.<br /><br />This is my review:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never received my GHB, nor have I received a customs letter.<br /><br />The FE policy is crummy, but I would&#039;ve cancelled my order if he hadn&#039;t marked it in transit before asking me to FE.<br /><br />I&#039;m a little put off since it seems fishy to ship first if you have a FE policy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I left a review of how I felt the transaction was fishy. He might be selectively scamming overseas buyers that order small amounts of his product (too insignificant to care about) since the entire transaction had been weird. Recently I have been contacted by Amsterdope and have been threatened to be blacklisted for leaving an honest appraisal of his services. I am not seeking a refund or resolution through SR since I voluntarily released my funds.<br /><br />I caution all buyers who do business with Amsterdope to be aware that if you leave a negative remark it isn&#039;t beneath him to threaten/blackmail you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt; If I was a scammer do you really think I would scam you for one of the smallest items??<br />Yes, it makes sense to selectivelly scam on insignificant orders so you can write it off as customs/lost/etc. and not have many people dispute it.<br /><br />I am not asking for a refund. Blacklist me if you will, but I will be posting your attempt to blackmail me on the forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />Amsterdope(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was a scammer do you really think I would scam you for one of the smallest items??<br />Wasn&#039;t it because it was a international order I would have ask you to FE anyways because of you fucked up stats.<br />You will not get a refund nor a resend also will I put you on my blacklist if you don&#039;t change your feedback into something<br />reasonable, I will spread your name on the vendors round table, telling my colleague venders also to avoid you.<br /><br />Ad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />xxxselective scamming. is selective bro. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />Amsterdope(97) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 96.9% positive feedback. How on earth do you think i am scamming my customers with such feedback.<br />Please explain because it makes no sense at all.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!!<br />When you purchased products from us you agreed explicitly to our Terms and Conditions.<br />Please understand that we DO send all orders to our customers and given the nature of this business risks like an intercepted order is not something unusual.<br />Also, you have to understand that there are forces and circumstances beyond our control and that you have to accept the possibility of such to happen.<br />You can easily check our feedback page to see that we are a vendor that does his part and always sends the package well prepared and On Time to be able to go through.<br />The rest, if the package is not delivered is out of our control. This is sensitive business and anything can happen. We don&#039;t carry responsibility for the loss of your product because it is illegal in its nature and seizure by customs is something you should always keep in mind that it might happen. What is expected from our part is done in a professional manner so that the package can go through at a minimum risk.<br /><br />- AD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />xxxxSo that gives you the opportunity to selectively scam customers outside of the EU?

				I never insinuated that he might be selectively scamming in my feedback, so the butthurt reaction just seems abusive.

				It&#039;s a dick move to throw around the word &quot;scam&quot; when dealing with a simple transaction.&nbsp; You&#039;ve pretty much abandoned hope of a civil discussion at that point.<br /><br />I recently had an order that a prominent vendor screwed up.&nbsp; Instead of getting angry when I realized something was wrong, I gave him time to be aware of the problem and address possible concerns, and I kept up regular, civil communication.&nbsp; In the end, he sent me a couple hundred dollars more product than I&#039;d ordered to apologize for the problems and delay.&nbsp; I guarantee that if I&#039;d acted like you I&#039;d have gotten nothing.<br /><br />Also, it looks from the transcript like you ordered, waited two weeks to send a message, then waited two more weeks to send your next message.&nbsp; Why should the vendor take the order seriously if you aren&#039;t even in contact?

				1. THe order was marked as in transit immediately, so I did not have any reason to contact the vendor. It was out of my hands.<br />2. I never sent this to the resolution center, I respected the FE policy and lost my funds willingly.<br />3. I never insinuated a scam on the feedback section. I gave my honest feelings about the transaction, informed the public I never received my package, and washed my hands of the vendor. <br /><br /><br />I understand what I have said to the vendor in private, but I did not attack him or defame him in public. I simply said things seemed off and I didn&#039;t receive my GHB as well as FE is crummy.

				1. If you don&#039;t get the package, you have plenty of reason to contact the vendor.&nbsp; Waiting two weeks was your decision.<br /><br />3. You used the word &quot;scam&quot; when talking to a vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor, but if I was, that would put you instantly on my shit list.&nbsp; If your goal is to resolve a problem, not amplify it, civility is usually the best option.

				Agree with warfareonion.<br />Vendor must confirm an order so buyer can finalize, so vendor with the rule of FE confirmed shipping but it was not actualy sent until buyer FE!<br />Buyer MUST to read vendor profile for terms!<br />You cauld pm vendor as you thought wrong about confirming shipping, your fault.<br />Your insituation about not actualy sending your order is offensie!<br />Gather vendor reputation first and see your rep to compare. And what makes you to tell the true about not receiving an order, on what base to detirmine that?<br />Reading this thread makes me sick, its full of speculation and wrong moves by buyer who does not know to read terms and how FE works!<br />Leave behing typical attitude - I am being screwed, when you don&#039;t have any credential to show!<br /><br />-1

				I&#039;ll add that in my one bumpy order, the vendor actually didn&#039;t send the order, but thought he did—it was confused with another order.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t send a message yelling that he didn&#039;t send the order, I just said that I hadn&#039;t received it and that I noticed some inconsistency and would he please look into it.&nbsp; That&#039;s how you treat people if you want to be treated well.
