				Has anyone taken 25c-NBOMe and then smoked some DMT while peaking? I smoked DMT while peaking on shrooms and blew out the last hit and started huffing a nitrous balloon without breathing in oxygen between. I left this dimension/reality... Or saw the multiverses. It was awesome. So, 25c-NBOMe, a phenatylamine, and DMT... thoughts?<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				I have not tried this combination directly, but I don&#039;t see why there would be any issues with it.<br /><br />I once dosed DOC, 2C-E, and 25i-nBOME(low to medium dose of each), then took a good rip of my friend&#039;s DMT extraction.&nbsp; My head space did not change much, but I got some interesting visual patterns crawling around the room, and I almost never experience geometric style visuals.

				It should be pretty cool. I feel the DMT would Overide the 25c-nbome experience in high doses based on my 25i-nbome experiences. Lower doses&nbsp; of dmt combined might be a cool enhancement.

				my shroom, DMT, nitrous combo resulted in me having a 15 minutes DMT trip (strongest one ever), then taking a nap (or, &quot;Going downstairs to die,&quot; as I told my friends. ha), then waking after 10 minutes back into the shroom trip in progress. so, the DMT will over-ride the 25c-NBOMe... but then will let it take back over.

				In my experience cannabis goes well with just about all psychedelics.&nbsp; I tend to toke like a fiend during the come down as it lengthens the good positive vibes for a while longer.<br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on IV such things though.

				THC does go great with psychedelics. I really love it with dissociative drugs too (they feel like LSD and Heroin had a baby to me)! I may Robotrip some on the &quot;Night of Excess&quot; as I know some pot will kick in the DXM like crazy....

My late-fiance, my Junkie Queen, and I used to love doing IV Molly together. You both load up a shot, and find a vein that&#039;s solid. Then, you look each other in the eyes... Deep into the other person&#039;s soul you gaze... and y&#039;all blast off in unison, eyes locked. You watch their pupils blow up like balloons. And, instantly, you peak. Get some L-Arginine from the grocery store (a supplement, an amino acid) and take like 6+ pills as part of your pre-dose supplement ritual. Then, you won&#039;t have Molly-Dick, and she will have an easier time getting off too. Just some advice on how to beat the problem of drugs that alter Serotonin levels and leave you hyper-sexual but limp. It works for any drug, really. And no worry about the 4-hour boner like with Viagra. This is a safe, natural supplement you eat daily without realizing it.<br /><br />Seriously though, try the &quot;IV Molly Staring Contest&quot;.... You will bond so much during that rush.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

Yohimbe is an MAOI! steer clear of that one boys and girls. ha. i learn something new every day... a wise man knows he is a fool...<br /><br />well, my turn to ask another question... the DMT Nexus forums state that 2C compounds can be mixed with DMT&amp;Syrian Rue... does that mean that the 25c-NBOMe is safe with MAOIs?<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				^^ quickfunding group, please quit spamming every single thread... Reported!<br /><br />And to answer the question, I don&#039;t see too much danger in that combination.<br />I would however advise against IV&#039;ing incredibly potent research chemical phenythylamines, we are talking about something thats active in the sub milligram range, I could see vasoconstriction becoming a problem if you push the dose even slightly too high with the NBOMEs, especially IV. Remember people have died from this compound, its dose response curve is quite different than the more well known psychedelics.

				on sublingual/oral 1,500 micrograms right now. added 500 micrograms (about 6 hours, i think, after the initial dose) while i gave my friend 1,000 micrograms. we smoked some of &quot;ringo deathstarr&quot;s DMT in the car outside the house. a 55mg bag i weighed out in a filtering flash to vape it got us both blasted off. it should be noted i&#039;m on 20mg of OxyMorphone and 40mg Methylphenidate a day... i went first.<br /><br />the body load wasn&#039;t a load... it was euphoria like i have never known. my tired bones and weak flesh became flooded with... light (?). my friend, a female, looked even more beautiful than ever. i told her that i could see her energy, and that it was beautiful (she&#039;s an incredible person... attractive, but still a virgin at 20, smokes pot , though is taking a &#039;tolerance break&#039; right now, and is curious about psychedelics and not about my needles&amp;narcotics like most). the closed eye visuals were the racing, snaking, geometric, beautifully simple ones i expect from DMT. i tried to push through the light... i saw two stereotypical aliens and projected that they disapproved of me (because of my infected hand from IV&#039;ing... and IV&#039;ing in general). then, a stereotypical god (old white man with a beard and a white robe &lt;eye roll&gt;) appeared and chased them off. i took this to mean, even if there was a god (besides you and me), he wouldn&#039;t want me to suffer; he would encourage hedonism. i felt at peace with everything, and the edgy feeling coming down off the initial 25c-NBOMe dose was completely dispelled. i call DMT &quot;playing death&quot; as it is what death will be. i know i could die today and have a content afterlife though.<br /><br />i cannot comment on my friend&#039;s experience. it is too personal for her to have adequately explained to me even. we had some telepathic moments though (and i&#039;ve been hanging out with her a week or so... she was a co-worked turned friend). like using the exact word the other person stopped, unable to think of. or perfectly explaining a phenomenon that was occurring. after blasting off, i returned the flask inside, and we drove to a park. we walked around, laid on the asphalt looking at the nite, laid on the grass listening to music, it was all incredible. when my friend dropped me off at home, i ate a little and turned on the TV for a little. i&#039;ve become a &quot;Grey-A demisexual&quot; since my fiance died... but, i found myself aroused. things felt really good... and i had an afterglow (doesn&#039;t happen without a partner for me). i would love to try the 25c-NBOMe with someone who was into me and i was into them....<br /><br />silo&#039;s 25c-NBOMe blotters are worth every BTC.<br />ringo deathstarr&#039;s DMT is as well.<br /><br />this comes from an experienced cosmonaut (i have HPPD; constant tracers and white walls are non-existent to me)...<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				A copy of the message I sent Ringo about yesterday....<br /><br />Yesterday, we dosed 750 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe each... and went out and bought three big cans of whipped cream with my food stamps (haha... i took a picture of my purchase on the self-checkout stand... three cans of whipped cream and a thing of sprite, the 25c causes nausea). we blasted off and as we blew out our last hit each, hit nitrous. it was indescribable. and my friend laid her head on my chest. i got to experience death in the arms of someone who has given me nothing but positive energy. it was the most connected i&#039;ve ever felt to another person. she chose to cuddle with me when she blasted off. we ended up drinking later and watching a movie.... made-out. she&#039;s 20 and a virgin (thought those only existed in middle-school, didn&#039;t you? ha)... i&#039;m a man-whore; i&#039;ve literally sold my body to both sexes (and to a really hot girl one time actually) as well as a brief career as a stripper (the half-way house made me quit, who would have thought?). i&#039;ve been date-raped by two girls (twice by one). my view of sex is FUCKED. i&#039;m honest with my friend though; and she appreciates it and is helping me keep things at a healthy pace. seriously, my late fiance and i did speedballs once... and after 15 minutes and the &quot;rush&quot; subsiding looked at each other and asked, &quot;were we just fucking like crazy? you felt that too?&quot; there was a foot of space between us. with my new friend, yesterday i felt like cuddling with her was like &quot;making love&quot; and wanted a cigarette after. so different, but similar. narcotics resulted in a shared feeling of FUCKING (primal, physical) while the psychedelics resulted in a shared feeling of MAKING LOVE (emotional, tender).<br /><br />i am re-ordering my &quot;Fireball&quot; supplies today (and i think my friend wants some more of your DMT, she loves it and i feel 100% okay with her doing it... not like an old friend who loved my 3-MeO-PCP IV....); and i know that i will be able to put the needle down after i do it. I KNOW IT. and your DMT has played a major part in this.<br /><br />thank you so much, my friend.... you&#039;ve helped me return from the dead.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Lots-of-Love,<br />~f.xy<br /><br />P.S.- blasted off yesterday AM by myself... here&#039;s what i wrote:<br /><br />DMT philosophy....<br /><br />patterns are present with the CEVs. what are patterns but habits? what are habits but rules? what are rules but laws? this is why mankind shirks away from anarchy as a whole. i do not know what political system is best; other than &quot;narco&quot; should be included in the word.<br /><br />back to the beautiful, unspoiled laws inside my eyelids....<br /><br />a government&#039;s only role should be providing nutritious food, adequate shelter, medical care, justice, and drugs (both narcotics and psychedelics) to those who can&#039;t take care of providing themselves with those thing.
