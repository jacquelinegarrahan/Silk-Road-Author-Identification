				&nbsp;There seems to be a shortage of dmt on SR. I dont know if the demand is just lacking, but a look over at the US vendors is pretty unimpressive. Prices are high and quality is terrible. Especially that yellow and brown stuff... thats not good product.<br /><br />&nbsp;One vendor claims to have 98% pure product, but its a strange color and I can&#039;t imagine why it would be.

				Why not just extract your own? It&#039;s pretty simple, and a google search will lead you in the right direction.

I also care about cultivating the base of the community and spreading knowledge.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t want to get wrapped up explaining all the reasons why a user would choose to buy over SR... but I&#039;ll hit a couple points that I think are particularly relevant.<br /><br />1. Purity...New chefs often yield dirty product... they may prefer buying well cleaned and well crystallized product that they would otherwise be incapable of yielding.<br /><br />2. Cost efficiency... Will not favor an extraction if you are only looking for a small amount (which goes a long way with dmt). For extraction a user needs to invest hours of research, source chemicals and reaction-ware, and provide a safe environment and procedure for the actual work. If you purchase a gram of DMT of the silkroad you should be able to acquire high quality for 100usd. Thats going to be 20 blastoff doses... or 40 face melting doses at apprx 5usd or 2.5usd per hit and very little investment of time.

				Extracting is the way to go unless there is some specific boundary which is stopping you. The materials needed (precursors isn&#039;t the right word, it&#039;s not a synthesis) can be found online pretty cheap. I ordered most of the stuff off Amazon, that may seem silly but I&#039;ve never heard of anyone getting in shit for buying perfectly legal things from Amazon. For plant material you ideally want Mimosa Hostilis root bark, which is still legal (or at least grey area) pretty much everywhere. A simple straight to base extraction is childs play.<br /><br />1. Lyse plant material using a strong base like sodium hydroxide (lye)<br />2. Separate DMT from aqueous layer by adding a non-polar solvent<br />3. Separate non-polar solvent from aqueous layer<br />4. Separate DMT from solvent (depending on the solvent there are different ways to do this, if you use naphtha for example you can free the crystals out, if you use xylene you can salt them out... or any clean solvent you can just evaporate it and the DMT will be left behind)<br /><br />(in even more simple terms: add plant material to water, add lye to water, leave for a while, add solvent, leave a while, remove solvent and evaporate or freeze to get crystals)<br /><br />*clearweb*<br />www.dmt-nexus.me<br /><br />^ This is the place to go to learn how to do it. There are plenty of teks to choose from. I use a modified STB tek with xylene and lye and I usually end up with waxy off colour stuff, ranging from yellow to orange and once it was dark brown like chocolate... all of it does pretty much the same thing in my experience, and it&#039;s really easy to clean it if you are fussy.<br /><br />If the cost of a sellers account wasn&#039;t prohibitively expensive for me at this time I would probably start selling it on here myself for about half the price people seem to be charging.

				you obviously know NOTHING about DMT if you think its better to buy crap off SR than extract it your self<br /><br />ive been extracting myself for a couple years starting from a kilo of mimosa bark and getting about 17 grams of white crystal<br />and less than 15mg will have me blasting off when smoked correctly<br /><br />having your own dmt on hand it great for changa and other methods

				The vendor you are referring to with the 98% pure DMT (rogerpete) , actually has very high quality DMT.<br /><br />Ive bought from AddyQueenHashKing and that DMT was okay, but rogerpete&#039;s DMT is very impressive. I was getting breakthrough experiences off of 40mg, where it would normally take 50-55mg for me. The price is higher than it should be, but I still prefer rogerpete over anyone else.

				Hey guys :-) I&#039;m a new Australian vendor here, but I do like to escape reality once a month like us all!<br /><br />AussieDMT should not be overlooked as an international vendor.. He is my soul source of personal DMT. I&#039;ve tried DMT, changa, smokeable shrooms, lsd, everything - I chose his shit to escape with. Look into his vendor page - I&#039;m not sure where he ships, but he has the most unique form of DMT I&#039;ve smoked/snorted.<br /><br />It takes me to my pattern paradise :)

Hit it lightly at first, and steadily harder until your smoking it as you would a normal pack of cannabis. Most folks will tell you to use three hits.... a light hit, a medium hit, and a powerful hit. This is because the dmt vaporizes at low temperatures and is much more active when heated efficiently.

				&nbsp; I didn&#039;t read all these but it&#039;s probably due to the shortage of mimosa hostillas root bark.....

My stuff doesn&#039;t skip any processes and is rex&#039;ed 2-3 times in heptane. It looks like crack (pure white crystalline) when done.

				QUESTIONS ABOUT N,N,DMT: THE RELATION OF COLOR TO PURITY (and other considerations)<br /><br />At the highest grades of purity your dmt will be translucent crystals or white powder. Snow white, very pure.<br /><br />If there is color in your product then it is because there are byproducts of the extraction or synthesis mixed with your dmt.<br /><br />In the cases of extractions, the color differentiation can vary between plants.... but yellow is a common example, especially from Jurema. <br />&nbsp;Yellow product from an Jurema extraction contains fats and oils from the root (Its not harmful). Other plant sources may have harmful chemicals in them, like Gramine.<br />&nbsp;From user experience, it would seem that the addition of fats and oils from the plant can diminish the cerebral rush of the dmt... but can also increase the body load significantly. (roll)<br /><br />In cases of synthesis, there can also be color differences from byproducts. These byproducts will relate to the route taken for synthesis and I without that discernment I can&#039;t add much. You&#039;re certainly better with white product though.<br /><br />As for brown product.... especially from Jurema... thats just nasty extraction goop mixed with dmt. The dmt will still get you going, but youll watch it melt away leaving behind nasty brown goo that burns and crackles. You definitely don&#039;t want to inhale this goo, its gross and highly basic. (Kitchen chemistry gone awry)<br /><br />That yellow and brown product that was up for sale last week... and maybe this week.... is hardly product at all. That seller should take it down and refine it.

				There&#039;s been a huge shortage of mimosa hostilis root bark powder lately due to the DEA cracking down on it&#039;s distribution. despite this, I have found a website (mhrb-shop.nl) that sells very good root bark at very good prices. Shipping takes forever (like a month almost) but this site is totally legit! I&#039;ve been making a lot of DMT lately of decent quality and I might consider selling on SR if a real shortage happens. The process of making your own is pretty easy though honestly, it just requires a decent investment.

Normally taken orally.<br /><br />DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are quite similar. 5-MeO-DMT has a much more physical experience, more of a bodyload and rapid heartbeat. 5-MeO-DMT also lasts longer, strong effects even at the 30 minute mark. The visuals on 5-MeO-DMT are also quite disappointing compared to DMT. Many more people tend to dislike 5-MeO-DMT because the visuals aren&#039;t as good, plus the physical experience and long duration can be unpleasant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />me and my associates have quite a bit of experience with all three<br /><br />4-aco-dmt is similar to mushrooms&nbsp; and according to experts such as dennis mckenna (whom i&#039;ve talked to personally about this)&nbsp; &nbsp;the chemical metabolizes into&nbsp; psilocin (active ingredient in mushrooms)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />now i&#039;ve never tried psilocybin ( which is also alleged to metabolize into psilocin in the body)&nbsp; to note if there were any differences between the two&nbsp; &nbsp;but i have done mushrooms and i&#039;ve concluded there is destinct differences between the mushroom experience and 4-aco-dmt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(others who have tried both have said same to me)<br />so this could be due to it metabolizing differently than originally thought or maybe there is a different chemical in mushrooms that may effect the brain psychoactively in addition to psilocin (beocystine perhaps?)<br /><br />5-meo-dmt is MUCH different than n,n,-dmt,&nbsp; &nbsp; the similarities are that both are of short duration and both are commonly smoked, (except in epena or cohoba snuffs or accompanied by ayahuasca vine)&nbsp; also the duration is very short ( dmt generally between 10-40 minutes)&nbsp; &nbsp; also both are capable of easily putting one into an OBE state&nbsp; with complete ego loss<br />some differences are the following&nbsp; &nbsp; n,n,-dmt is impossible to overdose on, 5-meo-dmt it is not uncommon for people taking doses 30mg+ to have seizures and make absurd noises involuntarily,&nbsp; n,n,-dmt is generally considered the longer acting&nbsp; also even more so i would consider it longer acting because of the last statement&nbsp; (i.e. you can inject a full gram of n,n,dmt&nbsp; &nbsp;IM and trip for 3-4 hours&nbsp; &nbsp;while 5-meo-dmt may kill you before being able to reach this duration),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5-meo-dmt is more tactile and less visual oriented than n,n,-dmt.&nbsp; &nbsp; 5-meo-dmt is generally considered stronger by mass,&nbsp; n,n,-dmt is more popular as a recreational drug. alot of people find both terrifying, but more people find 5-meo-dmt terrifying&nbsp; <br /><br />any questions?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is extremely informative and I must say I&#039;m very jealous of your conversations with the dennis. I&#039;ve heard him on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast before and he&#039;s a very interesting fellow full of wonderful &quot;illicit drug&quot; knowledge. I pretty much found what I was looking for in this thread with all you guys being so helpful. I would have been on the forums months ago if I had known about the noob-50 rule. The n,n,-dmt seems to be what I&#039;m after. I&#039;ve smoked it once before but it was a brownish color not the pure white. The visuals are what I&#039;m looking for. Actually one last question. After smoking the n,n,-dmt you&#039;re supposed to just close your eyes, correct? That&#039;s what I did and I saw some unimaginable things in my minds eye.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />oh, i might have given you the wrong impression.&nbsp; we don&#039;t like.. hangout.&nbsp; i just met him when he was giving a talk about his new book (which i have signed and numbered&nbsp; btw =] )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and he gave alot of time for questions.&nbsp; so i asked alot,&nbsp; although he couldn&#039;t explain to me why bufotenin is active nasally but not intravenously.&nbsp; according to neurologists the structure of bufotenin isn&#039;t supposed to cross the blood brain barrier. my assumption is that it can&#039;t, but it is actually a prodrug that must be broken down by enzymes in various mucus membranes.<br /><br />the brownish color of your dmt is likely due to one of two things (or both)&nbsp; it could be impurity of material (the material that dmt is generally extracted from is also used as a dye, giving a rustful red brown color,&nbsp; &nbsp;or it could be that the dmt has been exposed to air too much for too long and it has oxidized.&nbsp; either means a notable drop in potency.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where as&nbsp; a pale yellow to white dmt is likely very pure. with good dmt and negating pyrolosis by heating at a low temperature (use a vaporizer or the glass vapor genie)&nbsp; &nbsp;then 20-30mg&nbsp; should bring you out of body and into a whole another place<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anyways to your last question&nbsp; thats totally up to preference.&nbsp; most the time i actually choose to watch my environment change in front of me to study the stimuli exploding into visions of magnificent things <br /><br />if you have any more questions or want advice etc. about drugs (especially psychedelics)&nbsp; &nbsp;than feel free to shoot me a message and i&#039;ll see if i can help<br /><br />happy tripping&nbsp; :)

				Yeah, pure DMT is hard to get. I started selling it a couple of months ago, and I&#039;m having trouble meeting the demand. My aim is producing and posting small batches weekly, this way the quality is always top and fresh!&nbsp;
