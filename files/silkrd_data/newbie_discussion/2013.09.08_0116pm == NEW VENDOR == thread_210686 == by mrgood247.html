				Welcome everyone to Mr.Good24/7<br />I am here as a new vendor to provide you with a very professional and honest service. I will be currently only shipping within the United States. All orders will be shipped the same day as long as your order has been placed before 12 noon est. I will only be shipping express overnight. You will never ever have to finalize early. The reason for only shipping overnight is because I don&#039;t want anyone to wait 3 to 4 days to receive a order from me. All orders will be shipped express with tracking number. You will receive your tracking number you have the right to know where your package is at all times. The best part of this by placing a order with me you will receive pure uncut #4 heroin at the price of $150 a gram. This maybe the best bang for your BUCK!! I think it&#039;s insane to pay $250 or $300 a gram I don&#039;t care how pure it is. My heroin is very strong and potent so please be careful. Also every Wednesday I will be having a hump day sale to get everyone ready for the weekend.That means the price of my heroin will drop to $120 per gram ALL DAY every Wednesday. All orders will be shipped every day except on Sunday. Saturday orders need to be placed by 8:00 am. Every order will be crushed into powder form. For security purposes I assure you that the product will remain pure and uncut . I am 100% sure all orders will reach it&#039;s destination. Please be careful and enjoy!

As soon as I get a few coins we will be possibly doing business =) I see you&#039;re a new vendor. If you want to send me a sample I can give you 5/5 feedback and will def purchase from you in the future if I like it brother. Sending good vibes you way!!!

				Put in an order last night with this vendor to try them out.&nbsp; So far everything has gone great.&nbsp; He sent me my tracking #,&nbsp; has been great with communication, and doesn&#039;t require you to FE.&nbsp; I hope his product is as good as his service is.&nbsp; I will update when I receive the product on it&#039;s quality, but so far everything has been great.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend taking a chance and ordering from&nbsp; him, there&#039;s really nothing to lose and he will respond to you in a timely manner and answer any and all questions.

				Requires FE on his cheaper gram listing, but the higher priced orders he doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Sorry, mrgood247. Looks like we&#039;ll never do business.

				FE is such a retarded concept. i feel like most people just agree (as buyers) to never adhere to that. it would force vendors to stop calling for it.
