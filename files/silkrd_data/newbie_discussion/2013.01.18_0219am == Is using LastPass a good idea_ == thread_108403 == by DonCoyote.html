				I like using LastPass.com to get secure passwords auto generated... and saved<br />but I went through www.lastpass.com/tor to get the authentication re-done and now I&#039;m getting a bit paranoid&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Anybody got any ideas or a workaround, or what is it that you are using? (for secure password generation and saving)<br /><br />Thanks for any constructive (!) input.<br /><br />Cheers guys<br />Bests DC

				im thinking that he would somehow hide his info somehow on the usb he didn&#039;t say i don&#039;t know if theirs a way to do that i mean the cops would probly be able to see that theirs so much info on the usb and the porn would probly show in the foulder or whatever how much info it is idk how the guy would do it he was somebody that posted on the pgp guide that is locked at the top of the page for safety.

				With TruCrypt at least, you can have a hidden mount inside a mount.&nbsp; Only you would know it&#039;s there, plus the usual encryption to get to it.&nbsp; I use a password safe and put it inside the hidden mount.

				Just remember that while the court and legally order you to reveal your password, you can still play dumb.

				I just use lastpass because I cant remember my passwords half the time. Seriously, some sites requrie one capital letter, one number, one unusual character, four greek characters, and three algebraic functions.
