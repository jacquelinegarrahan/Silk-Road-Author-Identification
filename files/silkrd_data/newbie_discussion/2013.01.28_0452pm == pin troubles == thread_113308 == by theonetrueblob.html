				hello, sr. <br />i have lurked for a while, but first post.<br />i managed to delete the file in which i had encrypted my log in info on silkroad in an embarrassing fashion, i followed the guide in the PINS PINS PINS The Rundown thread.<br /><br />after three days and some hours the page refreshed and i was taken to a &#039;reset pin&#039; screen where i was prompted for my password. i provided it and clicked submit, but i was just brought back to the page which i was browsing. i now see a message in my inbox telling me to log out and back in to reset pin, but when i log out and back in nothing special happens.<br /><br />not only did i manage to delete and forget my pin in a horribly stupid way, but it seems i have also messed up the pin reset process somehow. any advice?
