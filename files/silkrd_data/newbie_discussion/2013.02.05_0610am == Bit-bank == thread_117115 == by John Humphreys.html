				Somebody asking for a 0.01 BTC loan got me thinking about the idea of a bit-bank. <br /><br />The obvious problem with lending money though the bit-world is how you can trust a totally anonymous person to not run off with your money. Reputation issues might help with small amounts of money, but even that effect is diluted by the fact that you can close down any account with bad reputation and simply start again. <br /><br />So my question to the brilliant minds of the forum -- what sort of safety requirements would you require before you would consider leaving your BTC with somebody else? Is there any way to get around the trust problem? <br />

				when it come to loaning out bitcoins, it doesnt have to completly anonymous though, it is legal to trade just the coins, isnt it?&nbsp; <br /><br />And if you are going to do it here you just have to make sure they have been members a long time, good rep, shopped a lot ++ <br /><br />Iam really not sure, but have to writing to get to 50posts anyway:)

I remember at like Christmas time some guy ordered a fake id from a vendor and it got nabbed or lost, and the guy asked for his $100 or whatever refunded and the vendor agreed he would, but the vendor sent him $2700 instead. So, when they buyer asked if it was a mistake and did he want the money back he just said &quot;no mistake, enjoy it - merry Christmas&quot;

On some pacific islands, shells were used as money... in jail and POW camps, cigarettes have been used as money... historically precious metals have been used for money... today pointless pieces of government-backed paper or plastic are used as money.<br /><br />The three common characteristics of money are (1) store of value; (2) medium of exchange; and (3) unit of account. Bitcoin achieves all of that.
