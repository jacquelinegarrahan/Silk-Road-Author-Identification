				Sorry if this is a silly question but I figured it was worth asking. <br /><br />As a completely new user to buying online I&#039;m finding it both a bit overwhelming as well as time consuming, mainly because I am in a hurry to find someone I can buy from.<br /><br />SR has definitely good alternatives and offers (mostly internationally), but setting up a BC wallet and acquiring BC (anonymously), along with all (local) vendors requiring FE since I&#039;m new, are big setbacks right now which might make it impossible to buy anything &quot;soon&quot;. I usually buy weekly when I have a good contact, so doing it through mail doesn&#039;t really feel effective for my needs.<br /><br />So, I was wondering if there is anything similar to SR that allows you the option to find local vendors to set up a meet and so on.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Setting up meetings in person will be WAY more risky.&nbsp; Do you REALLLLLLY know who you&#039;re dealing with?&nbsp; A cop could setup an account wherever, then setup a meeting them BAM your fucked.&nbsp; Gonna try to act anonymous in person?&nbsp; Just take the risk of online.&nbsp; That&#039;s why its been successful thus far, and will continue being so.

				This system only works because it has zero overlap with that system.<br /><br />In principle, I can see how your &quot;low-carbon&quot; option might appeal, but it cannot happen in practice, with the world in it&#039;s current state.<br /><br />It&#039;d be like matter and anti-matter colliding...<br /><br />
