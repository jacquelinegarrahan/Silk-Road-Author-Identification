				I&#039;ve had 5 transactions so far ranging from hash over acid to mdma, none of the highly respected vendors on SR demanded FE even though I was completely new.<br /><br />Then again, I wouldnt mind finalizing early if it&#039;s a vendor with great reviews and lots of customers.

				Vendors are human, some are assholes, some are awesome. I&#039;ve only made about 13 or 14 purchases, but in that time I&#039;ve been able to find the select few that I deal with exclusively.<br /><br />I always send &#039;greeting&#039; messages to potential vendors prior to ordering; I just say hello &amp; ask permission to do business with them. Occasionally I&#039;ll ask about their product if important details are lacking - which I&#039;ve only had to do a couple of times. How they respond tells a LOT about how they treat their customers. I&#039;m amazed at how many don&#039;t realize that there&#039;s more than one reason for what I&#039;m doing - I actually had a vendor tell me that he/she was too busy for chit-chat and to just place an order (I suppose asking what brand they&#039;re selling is too much info for some to actually know). Big surprise that said vendor has crashed &amp; burned.<br /><br />I feel your pain though. FE sucks. Unfortunately it&#039;s a necessary evil in select circumstances. I had to FE on my first purchase despite the risk I knew I was taking (I had been snooping on the forums for months before joining, and FE is ranked just below the plague). The vendor was reputable and had a stellar rating, I talked with him a few times, and all went well. He even hooked me up and we became &#039;friends&#039; before he gave up the biz. But I would never FE again because I don&#039;t need to.<br /><br />The escrow system is there for a reason, and it does irk me when some vendors try to go around the rules and require FE when they have no need to do so.

				there are several vendors who don&#039;t require FE from newbies either, but you could buy small amounts from reputable sellers and FE&nbsp; to them for the first few buys.<br />common sense can give you a hint who to trust and who to suspect.

				Why is FE such a hated topic? Most of the customers here are making purchases of between $50-$100.&nbsp; I know it sucks to ever loose money, but if you loose $50, is it the end of your world? If you loose $50 because of FE and get scammed, then you still have the forums to get payback. I think the major issue here is that most customers are already thinking they will be scammed, because of the nature of this business and nature of the people who use SR, that they look at FE as just another piece of evidence of how everyone is out to screw them. I know it&#039;s hard to trust people, especially on the deepnet, but I&#039;ve learned that if you give other people your trust, then in general you will be returned with the same. This of course does not mean that you should fall for every scam out there, be smart and use common sense. But don&#039;t always be so paranoid when in reality the vendors are generally not out to screw people out of their coins.

				There are plenty of excellent vendors who do not ask for new users to FE, I&#039;d highly suggest using them!<br /><br />I will not finalize until I receive the item although I do also make a point of finalizing immediately upon receipt, they should get their cash ASAP.

				I just boycott sellers who demand FE from short-time buyers or who offer free shipping for FE.&nbsp; It&#039;s unethical.&nbsp; There is one seller that when I first got an SR account and was trying to figure out how the fuck to fund a bitcoin address and all of that shit, he was really helpful, and when I finally was able to order, I ordered from him first, and I FE&#039;d.&nbsp; I had no problems.&nbsp; But, never again, y&#039;know?&nbsp; Because it&#039;s an invitation to get screwed over.

				I&#039;m just going to sit on some grams from a few different places (and probably have to FE) but whatever. <br /><br />I got ripped off when I first started buying pot as well - and I bet that most people here sold some half weight dime sacks for way more than they were worth to some suckers at their high school or college. <br /><br />Its all part of the game. The feedback on pages could be fake, the drugs could be shit, the cops could bust you or a bunch of other bad shit happen - of those things losing 50-100 aint that bad. <br /><br />Apparently thats what it costs to find out if a dealer is the real deal or not.

				I don&#039;t mind FE if I&#039;m spending $50, but when I&#039;m spending $300 I don&#039;t want to do it. I work for a living, I&#039;m not the one with the great hook up selling shit online. All in all though, if I FE I don&#039;t expect to get shit and if it shows up then great.

				I&#039;m new to all this, but I just feel like there is a certain level of &quot;oh I want everything to be perfect with SR&quot; I&#039;m sure most of these same people also send food back at a restaurant if it&#039;s not EXACTLY what they want. A few things you should consider before complaining about FE <br />1) SR is not the perfect way to buy drugs, but it is a much better system than calling Jose to come through<br />2) Vendors are businessmen and women. If any of you customers have ever owned a business, even a lemonaid stand, you know how hard it is running your own biz.<br />3) If you make life easier for the hard working vendor by cutting down on his risk by FE, then he will treat you much better than just a regular customer. Everyone knows businesses don&#039;t treat every customer who has money to spend equally? Some customers get better service. Some customers get better product. Be the vendor&#039;s friend and he will be your friend. I don&#039;t know about you but a cool DD is a good friend to have.

				I have FE&#039;d 4 times before; I got screwed over by 2 sellers, the others were OK. I have a very good buyer record, well over $6,000 spent.<br /><br />News Flash: you are buying illegal drugs on a hidden, anonymous marketplace.<br /><br />It&#039;s the cost of doing business, all you can do is do your research on vendors before buying and hope all goes well.<br /><br />Both times I got screwed over, it was by reputable vendors who ended up being scammers. Shit happens. Happens in real life, too.<br /><br />You need to look at FE and weigh this up: can I afford to lose this money? It really is a gamble, even from reputable vendors.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Using a site like this is all about protecting your anonymity, keeping your security tight, continuing to educate yourself on the way things work here on SR and minimizing every risk you take to lessen any chance of coming into contact with the Law. There will always be a risk, but how that risk is managed will play a major role in your SR journey. Complacency is not a good way to start off your experience here. Seems to me you&#039;re not comprehending the importance of your anonymity and security, as well as not following the guidelines posted by DPR on how to operate when using SR. The guidelines are in place for a reason and you trying to reinvent the wheel in your approach to things will leave you open for anything. There are some very clever people on here who would jump at a chance if one should open up.&nbsp; :(

				you&#039;ve really gotta look at it from the vendors point of view to understand why so many ask for FE. the amount of &#039;no shows&#039; from new buyers is ridiculously disproportionate to that of established buyers. when they&#039;re dealing with new buyers the risk of them going to resolution is a hell of a lot higher than with buyers who are established which shows on their stats. unnecessary refunds, reships, blackmailing threats to screw vendors feedback ratings, that&#039;s why they&#039;re wary of dealing with the unknown. it costs them a hell of a lot more to deal with refunds and they waste stupid amounts of time responding to idiotic questions. do your research, communicate politely with vendors, don&#039;t bombard them with messages. the smaller startups will probably be more lenient about letting you use escrow and having a good ol chinwag about the whole system. bottom line is that when vendors repeatedly get screwed by scam buyers they lose financially which can jeopardize their ability to remain on the road. i&#039;m not a vendor but scammers are putting the prices up for the rest of us. if you don&#039;t like a vendors terms then don&#039;t buy from them.

				well said Ron, well said.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel comfortable with FE, don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Additionally, if your a new buyer, don&#039;t be stupid, know your stuff and the sellers will respect you for it.

				You&#039;ve got to remember that these guys are running businesses at the end of the day, they get scammed as much as we do. Now some are low-life scamming pricks but others are generally just trying to make sure they don&#039;t get fucked over. <br /><br />You just have to try use your better judgement when asked to FE

I&#039;m bewildered at your attitude. The fucking owner of the site DPR, the person who built the site from scratch and engineered it&#039;s design and features, is the one who doesn&#039;t want anybody to FE! Here are his/her&#039;s exact words - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Always use the escrow system! This can&#039;t be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not on any mission, just pointing out a fact so some people will at least think twice about FE for a vendor. As I said before, it&#039;s up to a vendor to implement different strategies on preventing them from being scammed, not for buyers to FE. You&#039;re not adding a little balance here at all Ron, but rather posting about a practice frowned upon by most, including DPR, Admins and Mods, which could lead a newbie reading your post to FE and potentially lose their coins. I&#039;ve been around longer than you Ron, that I&#039;m sure of. I&#039;ve seen the moonbear shit too and the big scam pulled off by Tony76 during the 420 sale, where a so called trusted and respected vendor asked everybody to FE. Here is a little snippet to remind you of what actually happened - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> A few days before the great ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’ held on April 20, Tony76 posted in the forums that he was being targeted by a vindictive rival seller who had threatened to set up bogus buyer accounts to order thousands of dollars of drugs in “multiple orders, in multiple names, from multiple states”. Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To cut a long story short, in 2 days during the 420 sale, he disappeared with over $100,000, with some Mods saying it was more like $250,000. What would you say to these buyers who FE at the request of SR&#039;s most trusted and highest ranked vendor?? Seriously, stop promoting buyer&#039;s to FE for vendors because the vendor is the one being scammed. The vendor in that case needs to learn the techniques and skills required to stop that from happening.

Be polite, read their vendor page first and follow their rules, and you should be fine.

We as buyers just need to be honest and finalize any order we receive immediately. In turn, we expect our package to be delivered with the contents as described in the listing. Think of making the other party happy in what you do instead of just making yourself happy. What goes around, comes around has worked well in my 1.5 yrs on SR. :)

When first making some buys it&#039;s best to stick to domestic vendors to begin with as the chances of an intercept are much lower and thus reduces the chances of being scammed, ask for tracking etc.<br /><br />Personally I still FE for a couple of very trusted vendors without which I would not be able to buy from, goes against the established thinking here I know but I make an informed choice and only deal with straight shooters. I also know that if I run into issues they will work something out with me regardless of my having FE&#039;d.<br /><br />It took me months to find my feet, work out who was legit and who was to be avoided, we all get burnt once or twice and learn some valuable lessons and this place is your bible!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t get some vendors... this is clearly a sore spot with many buyers. Why they don&#039;t listen to the customers complaints I don&#039;t know. It seems simple enough: find what the market is asking for and meet those needs, economics 101. I&#039;ve been lurking the forums for a while and decided I would expand my little operation online and simply NOT do what people complain about.

But the problem is that theory economics can hardly be applied to the world when it comes to product and service. You require Advertising/Marketing 101 for that which is a nutshell: &quot;Make people think that they need your product, and make/take as much money as possible.&quot;

				I only really use one vendor .. have done so for along time, I don&#039;t mind FE with them as about 99% of all my purchases over 12 months on here with them, always come no problems. That 1%&nbsp; loss rate, we always reach an amicable resolution.<br /><br />Really can&#039;t risk introducing other vendors in the mix, &quot;no-shows&quot; would make me a paranoid delusional cunt, so I stick to my chosen vendor who always gets me what I require. It&#039;s actually when I try someone else shit happens, so I don&#039;t need shit in my life.<br /><br />All I will suggest for newbies is to do some research, get some purchase history/stats, be professional and not cracked out when reaching out/corresponding with vendors. Don&#039;t be afraid to send them a message on SR, see what they communicate like and whether or not they respond within a time-frame that you are happy with to your questions. Don&#039;t bombard them though. They have a business to run.<br /><br />Newbies are ripe for selective scamming even from the top vendors, so don&#039;t FE until you have built up trust and a relationship with a vendor. Even then some become too big for their boots.. and having 10 or so previous good orders with them, means shit to some .. but you just cull them when they are fuckheads like that anyway.<br /><br />ABC<br />

Sometimes mistakes are made, we are all human, so contacting the vendor first and giving them a chance to fix any problems is the way to go IMO. If you feel you could perhaps suggest to the vendor some ideas on improving their stealth, then by all means mention it to them in your message. If they don&#039;t want to help you in any way to resolve the issue, then leave the feedback you feel is appropriate.

				Vendors and buyers can both be victims to fraud...and it is up to each to draw their own lines...<br /><br />Trust is Golden in this community.<br /><br />The worst feeling however, is when a long-established and trusted vendor quits this game, and scams a hundred or so people on his way out.

One could ask a vendor an endless series of questions, anything from the time it takes to ship an order through to their packaging techniques and many more. However, this is such a place where most things are better left unsaid, especially when discussing details. If you stick with vendors who are tried and trusted by other members, with recent successful deliveries and happy customers, you should be fine. Always check this forum for any recent reviews of your choice of vendor and read their Homepage a few times to familiarize yourself with their terms and conditions and general demeanor before ordering. If a vendor seems rude or arrogant, look elsewhere. Most vendors don&#039;t like to discuss details, and rightly so as you could be anyone, with their customers. Once you receive an order, then you will get the answers you seek.&nbsp; If your asking about their product, make sure it hasn&#039;t been posted on their Homepage first before asking. We also have to remember that being a vendor is an extremely time consuming job so they aren&#039;t always around to answer questions at any time of the day. There are guidelines a vendor must follow which could answer some of your questions such as how long it will take to put an order &quot;in transit&quot; and so on. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ve read these, but have a look through the Guidelines for both vendor&#039;s and buyer&#039;s alike. Here&#039;s the link for you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

One could ask a vendor an endless series of questions, anything from the time it takes to ship an order through to their packaging techniques and many more. However, this is such a place where most things are better left unsaid, especially when discussing details. If you stick with vendors who are tried and trusted by other members, with recent successful deliveries and happy customers, you should be fine. Always check this forum for any recent reviews of your choice of vendor and read their Homepage a few times to familiarize yourself with their terms and conditions and general demeanor before ordering. If a vendor seems rude or arrogant, look elsewhere. Most vendors don&#039;t like to discuss details, and rightly so as you could be anyone, with their customers. Once you receive an order, then you will get the answers you seek.&nbsp; If your asking about their product, make sure it hasn&#039;t been posted on their Homepage first before asking. We also have to remember that being a vendor is an extremely time consuming job so they aren&#039;t always around to answer questions at any time of the day. There are guidelines a vendor must follow which could answer some of your questions such as how long it will take to put an order &quot;in transit&quot; and so on. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ve read these, but have a look through the Guidelines for both vendor&#039;s and buyer&#039;s alike. Here&#039;s the link for you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yeah, I get what ya mean about chillin out.&nbsp; I had read the guidelines previously.&nbsp; I think I just got way too wacked over that stupid situation. There is always risk here, and it is difficult at times, for me to figure out when I am taking a calculated risk based on accurate info and feedback, or a dangerous risk based on people who threaten their way in to glowing feedback.&nbsp; But I am starting to pick on some of the more subtler clues.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Hey,<br /><br />just thought I would throw in my thoughts on FE&#039;ing.&nbsp; I sell diazepam, and dont demand FE (apart from with buyers with ZERO purchases), I give it as an option for people, who if they choose to get some free extras with their order (if they let me know they have done so) or free with their next order.&nbsp; I think android posted about him doing this earlier in this thread.&nbsp; Generally I dont like FE, as I am a customer as well, (under a different username of course!) and have got burned once, by a very reputable vendor (actually burned is the wrong word, as Im sure it wasnt the vendors fault) who requires FE on all orders no matter what your buying stats are.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But as a vendor it does make my life easier, as I have had to wait the full 17 days for auto finalize on a number of occasions, and this truly messes up my ability to have a constant supply.&nbsp; So if people choose to do this, I will rub their back as they have rubbed mine by giving them freebies.<br /><br />I think that FE&#039;ing should be a choice, and I especially think that it should not be required by some of the most popular and the most reputable of vendors, as they are sending out hundreds of orders a day, they shouldnt need it as a requirement.&nbsp; If you have ordered from a vendor before, trust them, and they are offering you the choice to FE to help them out in exchange for the vendor helping them out (free shipping, extra goodies etc) then a customer should be able to choose to do so, and if they dont want to they shouldnt have to.&nbsp; Furthermore, if a customer does choose to FE, they should have an arrangement with the vendor about a no quibbles refund or reship if the order does not turn up for whatever reason (again, for this to be even slightly valid, you have to trust the vendor enough for them to hold up their end of the bargain if this does ever happen).<br /><br />As a customer, as soon as I receive an order, Silk Road comes into my head straight away (Why else would you have a package of drugs posted through your letterbox?!) and I finalize at the soonest possible opportunity, as I know how frustrating it can be for a customer to not release the funds for over 2 weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />For the much bigger scale vendors, who do literally send out hundreds of orders a day, a few customers taking a little while to finalize probably wouldnt make a difference to the vendor (unless they were particularly large orders). But for smaller scale vendors like myself, it does make a difference when you dont get the funds released within a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />All in all, I would agree, dont FE in general.&nbsp; There is no need if the transaction is between an honest vendor, who will send out exactly what they have advertised, and an honest customer, who will finalize straight away, or as soon as possible after receiving said order.&nbsp; If it were not for customers receiving orders and getting high whilst not finalizing for weeks, I doubt FE&#039;ing would ever have come into play at all.&nbsp; If a vendor does his or her part to get you your order as quickly as possible, then a customer should release the funds as soon as possible.&nbsp; That is a fair deal, and that is what SR should be all about.<br /><br />Anyway, thats my ramble over, I dont know what everyone will think on what I have said, but I thought I would post my thoughts, as this is such a big subject matter on the site.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Dazzy
