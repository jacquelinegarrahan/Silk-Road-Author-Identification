				I just joined and I&#039;m just getting my bearings about me. This has probably been asked in some variation but the forums here are so vast. It&#039;s crazy how much info there is to read up on in regards to all this. And it&#039;s so fascinating!<br /><br />Anyways, I made my first purchase yesterday. I probably did it a little hastily, but you live and learn, right?<br /><br />The vendor was like 95% rated vendor which seemed good on the surface, but then when I went to his thread in the rumor mill, it seems a lot of people complain about shipping times. I cant tell if it just seems that way because only the ones who haven&#039;t gotten their purchase tend to make a lot of noise, or maybe the shipping times with the vendor actually suck. <br /><br />I chose express, thinking that maybe the whole door-&gt;door would take about 3 days at most, and if I was lucky, it&#039;d be here tomorrow. But then, as I said, I visited his thread and people are saying that they chose priority or express and they would get nothing, even after 7 days. Even though their order changed from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit&quot;.<br /><br />It seems there are all sorts of troubles from shipping times, to vendor being unresponsive, to vendor setting it to &quot;in transit&quot; without it actually getting dropped at the post office (they only packaged/labelled the purchase, didn&#039;t actually drop it off yet).<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m asking is, how has everyone&#039;s experience with shipping times have been? And are the vendor threads more often the squeaky wheels posting and asking for statuses on their packages. <br /><br />Naturally I&#039;m a little ancy and anxious for my first order!
