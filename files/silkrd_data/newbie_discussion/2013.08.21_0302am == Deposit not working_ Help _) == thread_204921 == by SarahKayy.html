				When I transfer BTC from the place I purchase through to SR I check [CLEARNET] http://blockchain.info by searching for my wallet address. Here you can see your transfer pretty much instantaneously. By looking at the details of your transfer, you can see the amount of confirmations on the transfer. In my experience the BTC doesn&#039;t show up in my SR wallet until I have 7 confirmations. If you don&#039;t have any confirmations, blockchain will give you an estimate on how long it will take for the first confirmation. It&#039;s not always accurate, but if you&#039;re really impatient you can refresh the page every few minutes.<br /><br />Typically for me, once I get the first confirmation it doesn&#039;t take much longer to get the confirmations needed to show up in my SR wallet.<br /><br />You can read up on it in the SR wiki here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_isn.27t_my_deposit_showing_up_in_my_account.3F

Whenever I transfer from coinbase, it is usually quicker than when I use Blockchain. Haven&#039;t quite figured out why yet. Either way, its AT LEAST an hour before it hits SR. Thats the fastest it has ever appeared. IMO average time is 2-3 hours. I stopped checking about a yr ago lol<br /><br />-Judge

				Coin to SR wallet takes a minimum of&nbsp; confirmations @ 10min per confirmation. Some times, on rare occasions, it can take longer. Do not worry until its been longer than 24hrs.
