				They wanted to know why I am sending so much money to other people. I didn&#039;t get a chance to talk properly as I had no signal on my phone and the call broke up. I have been using BitBargain and the most I have transferred is Â£130 in a week. I have to go in and make a deposit on Monday and am going to tell them I have been buying Bitcoins for a) savings and b) Satoshi Dice &amp; other online gambling.<br /><br />I know this is probably a fraud thing but I would like to know if you guys have had any similar experiences and if so what you did about it / said.<br /><br />Thanks guys =]

				You do not have to tell them why<br /><br />They do not have the right to know what it is for...just tell them that it is you and you are aware of the charges. You are right...it is about making sure it is you and not some thief. <br /><br />

				First make sure it actually is your bank and not someone else pretending to be. Sounds obvious but you&#039;d be amazed how many people get scammed on the phone.<br />But you don&#039;t have to tell them anything. Simply for investment purposes or because you fucking feel like it, any reason is good enough and none of their business. It probably is just to check that you weren&#039;t getting scammed by someone making withdrawals or something though.

				I think the post above was most appropriate, dont antagonise them. Make it clear you do not need to explain your transactions and its private however explain it is you who is spending/sending/recieving the money so a block is not necessary on your account.

				I think that politeness is the plan tbf. I&#039;ll tell them I made the transfers, explain about the Bitcoin &quot;bank&quot; that offers 18% APR maybe even ask them if they can match it ;P and leave it at that.<br /><br />Probably going to stop being so &#039;Active&#039; on the account too. I have generally only been buying on Mondays but I&#039;m going to tell my mates to get there own damned Bit Bargain accounts and cut down on the mid week re-supply... at least online... for now. <br /><br />This hasn&#039;t worried me much about Packages or anything like that as I only buy domestic, but it got me thinking... Surely banks can tell who uses SR by the amount of money / frequency a customer transfers. I understand Bitcoin provides a layer of anonymity, but surely they will find the buyers at least. I mean they have all these Fraud checks now, which I imagine is why I got my call, so what stops them from passing said information (i.e. the amount and time) to the pigs? Then the pigs could look at your mail for a few days and if anything fits the profile (i.e Pretty light, printed label, etc.)<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;ll let you all know how it goes on Monday
