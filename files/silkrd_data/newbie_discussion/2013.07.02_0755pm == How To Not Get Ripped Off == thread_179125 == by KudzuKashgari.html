				I&#039;ve decided to do a bit of research before making my first purchase, and for all the other newbies out there I thought it would be good to detail the methods necessary for a stress-less first purchase.&nbsp; For those out there who have more knowledge than I do, please reply with helpful suggestions for others (and myself) which I may have missed.<br />So, you&#039;ve obviously got Tor, and your profile is set up. Good.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;m not going to cover too much, but let&#039;s start with vendor profiles: who can you trust?&nbsp; As an example let&#039;s look at The Avengers.&nbsp; These guys review vendors of LSD, and they have compiled a list of very good, good, and bad vendors of said psychedelic.&nbsp; This will be an example to show that there are threads out there which can give you a good idea of who is legit, and who is not.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a little out of date, but most of the vendors are still selling.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the page:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Go to a vendor&#039;s section at the bottom of their page and you will see comments.&nbsp; You want to watch out for the &#039;freshness&#039; of the comments: do they have dozens of the same basic comment all at the same time?&nbsp; Beware; there are posts on the forum of people who actually sell positive reviews of vendors.&nbsp; I know, highly unethical, right?<br /><br />The next thing I want to cover is encrypting your address information if you hypothetically decide to make an order, so that only you and the vendor know your sensitive information.&nbsp; I found a good article, but I&#039;m only going to link page 3, so make sure to check the whole thing out.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-3-making-an-order/<br /><br />Seeing how I&#039;m new to Silk Road, I don&#039;t feel educated enough to go over any more, because I don&#039;t want to give anybody any information that isn&#039;t the greatest, so please, if you want to help out just reply with some other helpful tips for all of us newbies.<br /><br />

				A nice guide to get started out with! I must add something else though and this is aimed at the people who really, really want to be anonymous when ordering from the road or being online in general. I am talking about using TAILS (https://tails.boum.org/), learn how to use it!<br /><br />Here are some links to guides:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0 (The guide that I used. Probably the best of the three)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176112.msg1288265#msg1288265<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178897.msg1294661#msg1294661

				Thanks dfrosty, I&#039;ve heard about Tails in passing, but didn&#039;t think to research it.&nbsp; Ima check that out!

				I think TAILS is mostly useful if you&#039;re really hardcore about being anonymous. I&#039;ve thought of using it myself but I don&#039;t make enough purchases to warrant learning how to use it.<br /><br />Having been scammed myself a few times through SR and elsewhere in the deepnet I second your advice on looking through the forums for sellers you&#039;re interested in. Had I just looked through the forums using the search function for the vendor that scammed me (LegalizeMJ) I would&#039;ve have known about other people&#039;s problems with him before I placed my own order. I learned the hard way to check through SEVERAL DAYS worth of feedback to make sure the vendor&#039;s legit and THEN check the forums to doubly verify.<br /><br />Be weary of any vendors that ask for FE unless both the feedback and forums verify that the vendor is legit.<br /><br />Hope we all learn from other people&#039;s (including myself) mistakes.<br /><br />Peace.

				Great idea. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179125.msg1298722#msg1298722">Quote from: KudzuKashgari on July 02, 2013, 07:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />The next thing I want to cover is encrypting your address information if you hypothetically decide to make an order, so that only you and the vendor know your sensitive information.&nbsp; I found a good article, but I&#039;m only going to link page 3, so make sure to check the whole thing out.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-3-making-an-order/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There&#039;s a single-page encryption service here that&#039;s simpler than the two-page one linked in the article<br /><br />http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm<br /><br />tho I&#039;d personally avoid such services. Browser encryption is leaky &amp; dangerous. It&#039;s probably fine if you&#039;re just sending an address, but if you&#039;re seriously about encryption, you should visit GnuPG.org and download one of the frontend apps they link to. It&#039;s intimidating at first but the apps are easy to use &amp; if you join one of the SR PGP Clubs (the one in the newbie section is fine) to practice you&#039;ll get the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />Also the *Buying Bitcoin* section of that site needs to be updated. There are many ways to get Bitcoin but the best/easiest depends on who you are &amp; where in the world you live &amp; whether or not you&#039;re comfortable showing ID etc. Here it&#039;s best to just do your own research as you don&#039;t want to give out too much info about your location &amp; age &amp; so on. <br /><br />The only other thing I&#039;d add for newbies is to act like adults - when you post, when you make your order, all of it. (For most this won&#039;t apply but it does seem there&#039;s always a few not-yet-of-drinking-age in the newbie section). Of course you think you&#039;re smart enough &amp; independent enough to be ordering drugs online, but you need to convince others of this too.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not out on your own, don&#039;t order to your parent&#039;s house. Get a PO box or place to get your own mail. If your parents pay for your internet, same deal. Get a secure laptop and go use Tor from a public wifi station. It&#039;s not good for anyone involved with SR to see &quot;HALP MY MOM OPENED MY MAIL&quot; posts or &quot;hi guys my friends at school told me about SR&quot; &amp; vendors for obviously reasons don&#039;t like selling to kids. If you can&#039;t convince a few strangers online that you&#039;re a working adult (with access to a good lawyer) you may want to think a bit about your ability to keep your ordering a secret. :)<br /><br />A few other tips, tho they&#039;ve mostly been covered before. <br /><br />* Order small to begin with so if something goes missing or you do get scammed (happens to everyone) it won&#039;t be a disaster. <br /><br />* Try not to order more than one package at a time - it&#039;s tempting to load up a shopping care but safer if you make sure each has arrived w/out incident before ordering another.&nbsp; Being caught with a stockpile of drugs is never ever a good idea. Make sure that your personal stash looks like what it is. <br /><br />* Be respectful &amp; professional when communicating w/ the vendors. It&#039;ll help keep you from getting scammed &amp; help w/ any resolutions should something go wrong. <br /><br />* It&#039;s tempting to misspell your name(or use a fake one) when you give your name &amp; address. Don&#039;t do this. All it does is make your package stand out to the mailman or the mail sorter. You want your package to get to you as quickly &amp; smoothly as possible. The more accurate your address the better the chances it won&#039;t get a second look. <br /><br />* Many of the first tier vendors won&#039;t work with brand new buyers, or req new buyers to FE. Not a problem! Help out a new vendor instead. Yes there is a bigger risk that they might not be trustworthy, but if you use the forums &amp; your best judgment you can get some great deals. Also new vendors in the process of building their business usually don&#039;t mind if you ask questions &amp; talk w/ them a bit before you place your order, which is not a bad thing for new buyers. :)<br /><br />* Order Priority rather than Express. It&#039;s less likely you&#039;ll be asked to sign &amp; won&#039;t stand out as much as Express. <br /><br />* If you get a PO box, get a few eBay or Amazon orders there before placing your first order. It will make the first time you go pick up your SR goodies less stressful. (If you&#039;re ordering at home &amp; don&#039;t usually get much online, do the same thing, just so you know what normal package deliveries in your neighborhood are like. Plus the more normal parcels you&#039;re getting to your house the less the SR ones will stand out). <br /><br />* As KK said, the forums are your friend! Look for review threads &amp; check the Customer Support area too. (It&#039;s a good idea to do this even if you&#039;ve ordered from a vendor before, as there have been cases of established vendors pulling scams before disappearing). Be a good buyer, too, and contribute reviews. <br /><br />Maybe this is all obvious stuff, but it might help someone starting out! Let me know if I can answer questions or point you to other good resources too. It&#039;s not always easy being trapped in newbie-land. :)<br />
