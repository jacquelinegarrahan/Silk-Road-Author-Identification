				Right so made an order last week with BCExotic, i emailed him before making the order asking if it was possible that he could get a QP to fit through the mailbox as generally I am only able to collect parcels which have gone straight through the mailbox due to using a drop address, he said yeh asked some other stuff about holding a QP of a different strain for me but not really relevant to this, so then i placed the order and specified in the address box that the order must be able to fit through a postbox otherwise i can&#039;t get it. I then emailed him after the order to remind him and he replied by saying he would try and pack as small as possible and that safety was his number one priority, i thought this meant he would actually pack in small so i didnt emphasize again how important it was. Skip ahead a week and i get a call from my friend who was at the drop address by luck when the postman came so he was able to open the door to be handed a fucking giant parcel. It was lucky he was there otherwise that parcel was gone. I don&#039;t understand how a gigantic parcel is any stealthier than a sleeker package and i have had QPs packaged in a way that fits plenty of times before. I feel the vendor entirely ignored my request for no valid reason, Now i left a review in which i gave 3/5 and stated what had happend, i gave a honest opinion (which was a high rating) of the product and shipping time and gave a low rating of my experience. I also sent the vendor a message expressing my annoyance as that was nearly a lot of money down the drain, I do admit i may have used unsavoury language and been a bit heated in my message but i was kinda pissed off as this was not the first time a vendor had ignored this request. As a result BCExotic has had me blacklisted, i find this unfair as i was honest and truthfull and have used silkroad a lot and have had many a smooth transaction with efficient vendors, is it possible to be removed by a moderator? I have propposed to BCExotic that he remove me from the blacklist and in return i will edit my feedback. I&#039;m happy to go back on my word if it means less hassle, although i don&#039;t understand why i am getting it for leaving an honest review of my experience

				I dislike how vendors get such big boners over their rating systems.&nbsp; Vendors saying by receiving the package you are required to leave a 5.&nbsp; Cmon guys this negates the whole feedback system if everyone leaves fives.&nbsp; It seems just recently that everyone leaves fives for everything even if they arent satisfied.&nbsp; (This dope was light and the quality was lacking.&nbsp; It took a week and a half to get here but heres your fucking 5 out of 5)&nbsp; When I joined the road I had much more faith in the feedback system.&nbsp; Also if a vendor is sending a qp to your front door to be placed in your hands hes a jackass and I wouldnt order from him.

				i don&#039;t want to order from him again, however i would like other vendors to continue to deal with me which an unfair blacklisting really won&#039;t help

				DO NOT FEEL THREATENED BY THE BLACKLIST.<br /><br />First off about the blacklist:<br />It is not a DO NOT TO BUSINESS WITH THIS DUDE sort of list. Rather it is a place for vendors to share experiences about buyers. I can tell you 2 of my regular buyers are on the blacklist, and I have never had problems with them. So I think that the vendors who put them on there were just horrible service vendors, or make a f*** up themselves and did not want bad feedback. <br /><br />Secondly about feedback:<br />DO NOT FEEL THREATENED TO CHANGE YOUR FEEDBACK! You should give your opinion so others know what to do. However always give the vendor a chance to make it right. <br /><br /><br />So all in all, do not worry. 90% of the vendors probably do not have time time to cross reference every order with the blacklist. PLUS if you ever are having trouble you can always make a new account. <br /><br />

				thanks for the reassurance whiteshark, i actually lowered my feedback i left to a 1/5 after i got blacklisted for nothing, so not feeling threatened to change it back, i just acknowledge that it would be more beneficial for both parties involved to remove the marks from the others reputation, being pissed off means less to me than ease of business

				yep, although in this case its stupid cause both parties lose, ah well, i&#039;m sure the multitude of vendors i&#039;ve used befor won&#039;t have a problem continuing to work with me. The feedback system needs a revamp, i agree with Sir WW in that not every successful transaction deserved 5/5 and in people giving 5/5 for unsatisfactory transactions we just leave room for a drop in quality of goods and service, tis bollocks
