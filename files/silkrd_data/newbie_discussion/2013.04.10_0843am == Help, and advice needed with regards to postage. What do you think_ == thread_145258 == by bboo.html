				First of all I wont mention who the vendor is but I know they have a good reputation. It&#039;s been 21 days since I placed my order they seem convinced it&#039;s going to turn up however I&#039;m not so sure. Now what I need help with is what happens next, If it&#039;s been seized would I of heard from customs by now?<br />I&#039;m hoping my package has been lost in transit, but not knowing leaves me in a sticky position because I don&#039;t know whether or not my address has been flagged so I can&#039;t make anymore orders.<br />What does everyone think?<br />Thanks<br />

				It&#039;s not unheard of for international orders to take that long to arrive. 21 days since you ordered, but when was it marked in transit?

				Hi bboo, do they have a review thread? If so, what&#039;s the average amount of time people have had to wait? If other people have had to wait that length of time I wouldn&#039;t be too worried, but if everyone else had had their gear within a few days I can understand why you&#039;d be worried. Not too sure what happens with customs, though, think it depends on where you are and where the goods have come from.<br /><br />Also, what was it you ordered? I&#039;ve seen some comments from people that ordered gear that was packaged so stealthy that they couldn&#039;t actually find it when it arrived&nbsp; 8)

				@Dothedamnthing - The vendor marked my order in Transit on the 19th of March. But at the same time I placed another order from someone else in the same country, and this package arrived a few days after.<br /><br /><br />@Pigglemoo - I&#039;ve noticed lots of people mentioning this Vendor but in a positive light, most people have been getting their orders but there were a few that were in the same situation as myself. I&#039;m not sure if the Easter holidays is whats been the problem... 5g smoke

				Lots of factors can effect delivery time. It would help if you could say which country it was shipped from and where it was heading?<br /><br />S&amp;S

But, you never know, it could have been dispatched from a rural area.<br /><br />Was it a big amount of contraband? im not sure what the cutoff point is but 3.5ounces of weed isn&#039;t enough to trigger a raid in the UK. The worst that could happen is border control come to your house and try to intimidate you into admitting you ordered it (DON&#039;T ADMIT). You could get a letter from customs, or if its a very neglible amount then don&#039;t be suprised if nothing happens.<br /><br />

				But remember, its always better to order domestically.<br /><br />That being said, I am hopefully re-opening my vendor account today.<br /><br />High grade cannabis and 83% MDMA <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bb9a5285aa<br /><br />regards SND

				@seeds and stuff yeah I will only order domestic from now on at least I will have slightly less sweaty palms. The amount I ordered was insignificant a tiny amount but its just not knowing because I don&#039;t know if the address has been flagged and cause I&#039;m just finding my feet on here I have been wanting to get bigger amounts but I think the smart thing for now would be to look for another address . Obviously if anyone does turn up I will deny all knowledge and no comment no comment which is always the way I have dealt with the pigs in the past when I have been a wee bit naughty.<br />For all I know they never sent it I stupidly FE&#039;d for what I thought was a&nbsp; trusted seller but never again because you just don&#039;t know.<br />Thanks for your thoughts and advice people <br />@seeds and stuff I shall check out you vendor account for sure have a good one

				Its to my knowledge that if your address is flagged from an international order, its the nice people at the uk border control that flag you&#039;re address. Not royal mail. This means that domestic orders will not be picked up by the flag. In addition, you had a tiny amount of contraband so I would not worry about it. <br /><br />Hope this puts your mind at ease<br /><br />
