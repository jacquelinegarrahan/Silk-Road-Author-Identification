				Hi all I just wanted to post a warning to any new buyers or buyers that are thinking of ordering from kingcopkilla.&nbsp; This vendor is a scammer, cheat, con artist or whatever else one might call it.&nbsp; I have been a buyer on the road for quite a while so I know a good vendor from a bad one.&nbsp; And trust me KCK is a bad one.&nbsp; I needed some BTC fast and was stupid enough not to check his feedback.&nbsp; In the last week or so he has stolen from quite a few customers.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why his feedback is in the 90&#039;s or why this type of behavior is tolerated.&nbsp; I gave KCK a 150$ MP which he cashed almost immediately.&nbsp; I spoke with KCK before the order because I needed the coins by a certain time.&nbsp; His exact words were &quot;You have my word I will get you the coins by sunday&quot;.&nbsp; That night (this past friday) I made the order.&nbsp; It is now monday and I am stuck with no money and no coins.&nbsp; I have sent him many messages which he has not responded to.&nbsp; Some of the other customers he stole from lost allot more money than I but I feel I need to let everyone know about this con artist!&nbsp; KCK made me feel comfortable then he took advantage of me.&nbsp; If anyone else has been robbed by this son of a bitch leave a comment! Be heard! Behavior like this should not be tolerated on the Road but sadly it is.&nbsp; I think that SR staff should crack down on lowlifes like kingcopkilla.&nbsp; Like I said, KCK has done this to many buyers.&nbsp; Whether they made an order, FE&#039;d and then never got anything or, like me, gave him money for BTC and got nothing.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t believe me check for yourself.&nbsp; Look at the feedback.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let his 93% feedback fool you this vendor is nothing but a thief.&nbsp; It looks like he owes allot of people allot of money and is stealing from customers to pay off his debt.&nbsp; I just hope that SR staff might see this and do something to help everyone kingcopkilla has stolen from.&nbsp; THIS NEEDS TO END! Spread the word!&nbsp; Thief&#039;s like kingcopkilla are not welcome and they need to be stopped! Thank you for reading.

				damn im sorry to hear all of that....the longer he has the card cashed the worse it is for you....because he is moving funds around so you do not have the chance to freeze his accts for all you know he could have sold those MPs or reloadits whatever method you used....USE localbitcoin for your BTC...the road is too damn risky and i have been scammed for 2K just this month alone.....the only vendors on the road that have never screwed me for coin is BTCking and JumboMonkeyBiscuit, have had multiple transactions without and issue, but i would suggest you check out localbitcoins.....because they have an escrow system in place and it rids out the scammers....the vendors are all verified and what not so its way more legit and i always feel more comfortable using it, and the turnaround rates are usually a way faster you can find guys on there that get you your funds in 10 mins.....just and idea for ppl getting scammed on the road trying to get coin
