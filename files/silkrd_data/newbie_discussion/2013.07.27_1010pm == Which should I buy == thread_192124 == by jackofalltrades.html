				exactly you already have product to dish out....you will make the money back and have the TV before you know it....well let me know wen you get online i wouldnt mind snagging some addys depending on the price and obviously give you the feedback you deserve depending on how you treat me as a customer, but best of luck either way you choose man and above all STAY SAFE!

				This may sound bad for some people but THROW the TV out of your life. <br />I am sure you don&#039;t need to have a 55 3d tv!!<br /><br />Invest your money in something more practical/educational/and entertaining. <br />TV is not an entertaining thing. It is just a silly box which gives you boredom. Yes, some movies and documentaries are good to see but surely you don&#039;t need such a big tv. <br />From the other side if you do watch many hours at the television I wouldn&#039;t say ok buy it, but as a unknown friend that I am I will advice you to stop this terrible habit. <br /><br />This for now :)<br /><br />Adamiz
