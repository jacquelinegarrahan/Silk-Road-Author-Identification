				I ordered a sample from Silo, like many people have, and wow. Let me say that for a first time buyer, he is incredibly kind and easy to talk to. I&#039;m watching my mailbox with anticipation for the samples. <br />For my first time, I am extremely glad I went to him. I hope I enjoy the product because I would like to deal with him again.<br />My question is what other vendors are similar to him in customer service?<br />Edit: Silo sells 25C-NBOMe. Dumb of me not to include that originally.

				Silo is very pleasant to deal with and I have just been dealing with a new hash vendor called ReD EyE she is great for customer service and always answers mail promptly also her hash is outstanding. Personally if im thinking of trying a different vendor I shoot them a mail and see what they have to say about their product etc. just be aware the top vendors have a ridiculous amount of mail to get through.

				sup SiLo family?<br /><br />first off I want to thank you for your continued support and tell you how good it feels to read so many fantastic reviews! Now, I just wanted to let you guys know we have officially lost our fucking minds and are offering a lottery that will probably ruin us but whatever heres the just of it:<br /><br />************LOTTO OF ALL LOTTOS!!! **********************<br />One out of every 5 customers will have their order tripled!! <br />SELECTION IS RANDOM<br />Ex. You order 900 tabs you have a one in five chance to get 2700 tabs!!!<br /><br />This WILL NOT LAST FOREVER SO TAKE ADVANTAGE WHILE YOU CAN!!<br /><br /><br />(A few of yall should get rich pretty fast)<br /><br />GET ON IT , ENJOY <br /><br />SiLo<br /><br />P.S. remember the more your name pops up in the 4 forums that were made by several people (bad idea we need to consolidate) the better a deal we will offer you. If I were you I would chat about your experiences and start terrific conversations regularly on our forum, our actual forum:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=170737.0&nbsp; <br /><br />when ordering shoot us a message and tell us you&#039;ve been active on our boards and we hook you up big time! we love our fans and we love interaction between our family!<br />
