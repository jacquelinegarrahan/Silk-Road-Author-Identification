				Ok so I&#039;ve spent hours scouring the stickys, wikis and youtube tutorial but am coming up against a problem that I can&#039;t find an answer to. After downloading GPG4win and installing as per the video tutorial, I get a screen that asks me to &quot;define trustable root certificates S/MIME configuration then gives me a bunch of information that makes no sense to me. I am unable to proceed with the install unless I click &quot;skip&quot; but if I do that, the app installs but doesn&#039;t work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

				&nbsp;;) I would suggest GPG4USB program, far superior and there is an awesome tutorial posted by Astor that makes it simple. I downloaded both programs, played with both for days, and found the above mentioned way easier. Download it at this address if you care to try: gpg4usb.org&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the tutorial address is: 32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/&nbsp; &nbsp;Check it out anyway. Feel free to pm me if you have further questions. I spent many hours figuring out this very essential way to communicate. I got SO frustrated. Finally I found the link to the tutorial, and it started to make sense. SunQueen
