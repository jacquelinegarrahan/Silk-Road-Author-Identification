				I recently ordered a porn site rip (no shame ahahaha!) from the seller DrawkwarD. (The main reason was because I only had a few $ in my account and I didn&#039;t have any orders so I wanted to try some stuff out that would be cheap and (supposedly) instantaneous, so I could have a few purchases under my belt for important transactions to follow. But whatever, it&#039;s porn too, I don&#039;t care ;) ) Anyway, I ordered it seven days ago and it still says &quot;processing&quot; on the Orders page. Should I hit &#039;cancel&#039;? What will that do? I don&#039;t care if I get my $4 back or not, I just want to make sure I don&#039;t get any ratings that reflect badly either way. Definitely don&#039;t want a refund percentage just from something like this, with only a handful of orders on my account. I also definitely don&#039;t want it to auto-finalize, though wouldn&#039;t that not be an option until it&#039;s past the &quot;processing&quot; step?<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />P.S. It really seems like the seller DrawkwarD is a scammer. He has not returned my messages. Would love to give him a negative rating, if I can without it hurting any of my ratings. Regardless, DO NOT BUY FROM DrawkwarD!!!

				I know that you can not finalize or auto finalize until your order is past the processing phase.

You can read more about the ordering process on the SR Wiki here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process<br /><br />You can not provide feedback at all unless an order has been put in transit - if a vendor cancels the order after this, you will be able to leave feedback on their page.<br /><br />Libertas
