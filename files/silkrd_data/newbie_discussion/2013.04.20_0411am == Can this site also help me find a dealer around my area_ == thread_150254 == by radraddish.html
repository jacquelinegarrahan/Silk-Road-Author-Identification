				Sorry guys if this is a dumb or annoying question, I am new (obviously). <br />Clearly I want to start buying off here that&#039;s why I joined and am learning about it, reading up and being safe etc, <br />but:<br />I am also looking to find a dealer (weed) in my area (nyc) for the times I just need something quick. <br />I just moved here so I don&#039;t know many people and the people I do know aren&#039;t smokers so they have no idea. Can anyone hook me up? <br />Again, sorry if this is really dumb or out of line. <br />Thanks guys.

				Before someone yells at this newb for newbing around. If anyone agrees to meet you from this site, they are a police officer. I can almost 100% guarantee that. Plus you can find better quality weed on here for cheaper than NYC prices.<br />Trust me as I lived there for years.<br /><br />Chaos

				goes without saying there would be major security issues if things like that went on.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never really been in the situation of living in a new area.&nbsp; I know most people are a bit nervous of being judged from asking coworkers, etc.&nbsp; But if you know how to broach the topic casually it isn&#039;t hard.&nbsp; Just talk to people and get to know them a bit.&nbsp; Chances are someone smokes or has a friend or what not who does.&nbsp; Just a suggestion.
