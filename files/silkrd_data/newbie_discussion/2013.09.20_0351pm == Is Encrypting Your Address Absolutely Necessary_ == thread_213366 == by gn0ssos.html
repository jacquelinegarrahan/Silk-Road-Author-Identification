				Got another newbie question: How important is it to encrypt your address on SR? I&#039;m having trouble with PGP and am curious if it is an absolute necessary measure or if I can get by without it? If PGP is absolutely necessary, is there PGP software (for Mac) that I can download and run rather than installing, like the Tor bundle? Thanks.

				You should never trust your information with a 3rd party, ever.<br /><br />For the extra few seconds it takes to encrypt your details you would be stupid not too. If you are having trouble getting to grips with PGP there are some really good threads on here where you can get help and useful information. Do not give up because it is proving to be a challenge, it&#039;s a challenge worth persevering with, possible the most important challenge of them all.<br /><br />Encryption should be used for the transmission of all identifiable information.

				While I&#039;m able to use PGP I personally haven&#039;t bothered. AIUI, addresses are held on the SR servers and are deleted when the vendor confirms shipment, by which point the vendor will have decrypted the address to plaintext for shipping (and then, if obeying the rules, destroyed any copy of it). I feel that the extra security may be worth it for some people but for myself, purchasing personal amounts, I think it unnecessary.

Just look at the recent Atlantis phishing link that caught a shit load of people out, that phishing link still created an account on the real Atlantis site.<br /><br />Each to their own of course but I would still recommend encrypting all identifiable information.

				This is true. My behaviour is nowhere near as secure as it could be but it&#039;s sort of calculated against managing my own psychological difficulties. The risks I take are my own and I accept that any problems I encounter as a result are on my own head. What I do for myself is indeed not to be recommended to others.

Now some clever people will maybe figure out who it is, and maybe even who I bought the 2C-B from. Because the guy still has no PGP key.<br /><br />It&#039;s a total no-go for me. Why should I order from someone that does not even provide a PGP key when there are plenty of alternatives, that seem to have much better product also.

				The more encrypted the better.. Tor might be monitored by the FEDs, who try to look for a pattern. and the more data they have the easier it becomes.

				Wait.&nbsp; I was under the impression when an item is ordered from the vendor order page the address entered in the text box was somewhat secure because it is deleted when the vendor closes the page. <br /><br />If this is the case why is there not a message/banner on the order page where additional information can be added re minding use of encryption?<br /><br />I swear I just read that it is when messaging via - click vendor, click message that encryption should be used...&nbsp; but now as I think about risk.. <br /><br />Most vendor are using professional looking labels, these generated by a computer are likely to stay there...&nbsp; ugh my head hurts<br /><br />So encrypt the address we provide on the order page , why isn&#039;t said that way.&nbsp; I know it probably is ..&nbsp; great!&nbsp; I don&#039;t hear well and now I can t see.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				using pgp not only add a layer of protection for yourself- but it also says that you are serious about staying safe - i wont do business with anyone is not also serious about safety- its not that difficult- also here is a link to the whonix stuff that was menioned- this is about using a usb- but a search on the main forums reveals a ton of info- also astor and pine have made some great posts about security precautions

Just setting up Whonix hosted on Virtual Box is actually very straightforward and does not require a huge amount of computer knowledge and know how. Obviously if you want a high level of security it is worth the time and effort to get your head around what is required and make it happen. If however you just want to step up your security to something a lot more robust than just using the Tor Browser Bundle you might want to consider Whonix by itself, check out their website (clearnet)<br /><br />https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page<br /><br />You can still save the VM&#039;s on encrypted media like an SD card or USB so that they are not saved on your machine.

				Encrypting ones address is absolutely necessary. I don&#039;t deal with Vendors who don&#039;t offer encryption keys for me to do so. It shows a lack of commitment to security.

				Well done for getting it working :)<br /><br />PGP is essential to me. I&#039;ve never placed an order with a vendor who doesn&#039;t use PGP, even if they were significantly cheaper than competitors. Security is paramount.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Lately in searching through vendors, I go read their whole page and there is no key posted.&nbsp; I of course am disappointed and search on.&nbsp; Is the message here not only to always encrypt our info but to NEVER use a vendor that won&#039;t provide their public key?<br />Thanks!

				It should always matter. Even just buying small personal amounts you should still encrypt your address, and If you want more anonymous security in the physical world, You&#039;d get it sent to a dead drop and not your home address.&nbsp;

				YES!!<br /><br />imagine if a vendors account were compromised and your address was sitting there in plain view<br /><br />i will not use vendors who do not use PGP. even vendors who do use it but allow unencrypted info as sensitive as ones address are treading on thin ice.<br />

				No its not absolutely necessary, some use privnote others just flat text and trust the vendors.<br /><br />Personally We would anyways encourage and use encryption AT LEAST for addresses.

				privnote is not used by many vendors. stick with pgp encryption. while as one poster said, encryption is NOT necessary, but neither is birth control or condoms. USE encryption. don&#039;t use clear text. it&#039;s stupid to do so. period.
