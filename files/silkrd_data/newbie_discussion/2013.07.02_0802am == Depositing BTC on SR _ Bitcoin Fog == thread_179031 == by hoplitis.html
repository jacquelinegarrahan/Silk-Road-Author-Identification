				Hello guys,<br /><br />looking forward to learning about the winding paths of the Silk Road! I was asking myself about the risks of depositing Bitcoin to the Silk Road account. Is it necessary to disguise the transfer? And if so, how?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				I&#039;ve moved BTC from a local wallet to SR without any problem, but that was early on when I started using it and I didn&#039;t think much about the risk. I can&#039;t really comment on how severe the risk might be, but I think a lot of people just route the coins through several online wallets to provide some measure of separation. Seems like a good precaution to me.

				You can use bitfog if your more paranoid than the average bear. SR has a built in coin tumbling function.

				Thanks for the quick responses!<br /><br />What milliday described seems to be the actual function of Bitcoin Fog, mentioned by dirtybiscuitzz. I found this (clearnet) thread to be very informative: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How Bitcoin Fog works<br />You register an account on our website and deposit bitcoins to the designated address. After a couple of network confirmations, your money is registered on your Fog account, and you can schedule withdrawals. Each withdrawal will be split in a random number of payouts, depending on the amount, and the relative size of each payout will be randomized as well. Even the timing of those payouts will be randomly spread out over a period of time you will specify.<br /><br />Ideally you should deposit an amount of bitcoins to the Fog, wait some time (which will depend on how many users are using the service, right now in the starting phase we recommend a week) and request a withdrawal, which will not have the same amount as the original deposit, leaving some funds in the Fog.<br /><br />Then you should deposit another batch of bitcoins and withdraw yet another amount, again different from the amount you have deposited. This time it can be lower than deposited, or higher, adding the funds you have left from the previous deposit. This way there is no practically reliable way to do statistical analysis on the block chain and link your deposits to your withdrawals. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bitcoin Fog Company Link: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/
