				I want to give out some freebees to the first 15 people and all&nbsp; they have to do is pay for postage... Im going to announce when im gonna do it on here but I want to make sure that after the first 15 people put in for the freebees that my&nbsp; stats are not&nbsp; gonna be bad for having to cancel all the extra orders for the freebees being that Im sure that more then 15 people are gonna jump all over the freebees.

				I think you&#039;ll be okay. Just set the quantity limit to 15 and buying limit to 1. That way it cuts off after 15 and better luck next time to the rest :)

				Ya, I was kind of surprised to see single fentanyl patches going for almost 1.5 btc. That&#039;s like ... nuts. I think it&#039;s easier to forget what the exchange rate is when you&#039;re seeing numbers like &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; :P<br />

				I wish most people would understand how hard it is for new vendors when the few customers they get dont even leave a review.

				I just started using SR. My first two orders are in transit but I plan to ALWAYS leave a review because I do understand how difficult it can be for new vendors to build their reputation. Even established vendors need updated/new reviews to keep consistent customers.

				Likewise. I&#039;d never not leave a review after a successful transation.<br />I think it might be easy to get comfortable and take the lengths and measures put in place by the seller to ensure a successful delivery for granted.<br />Each and every transaction that completes without hassle is because the vender did it right. And, if the vender&#039;s doing it right, you should be stupid fucking grateful.
