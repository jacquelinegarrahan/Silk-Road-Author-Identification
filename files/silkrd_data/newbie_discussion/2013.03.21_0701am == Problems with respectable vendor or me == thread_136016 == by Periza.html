				Hi!<br /><br />I have a problem with a respectable vendor, or i am the problem, im not sure, he is in the top 5%.<br />I&#039;ve bought couple of digital books on Silk Road (to read them and to boost my number of transactions :) ), gram of shrooms and 5 grams of weed, and i had no problems with any of my orders in which i did not use PGP.<br /><br />So, i decided to order 2 oz. of weed from a vendor that requires PGP. but i understood that you need to send him encrypted message only when you send him messages on his e-mail, not on Silk Road(yeah, i was dumb). So i ordered 2 oz. from him, and ofc. he did not event sent it to me, 5 days passed and i canceled the order.<br /><br />I decided to give it another try, but this time with 1 oz., but still without PGP. Same outcome. :/<br /><br />So.. i read his profile again and ask myself: &quot;Maybe he requires PGP for all messages, even here on Silk Road!&quot; So i downloaded PGP, learned how to use it, and i sent him an order with my encrypted adrees. 3 days passed and my order is still in &quot;processing&quot; and i don&#039;t know what to do. :)<br /><br />Should i wait a little bit longer?<br />Do you maybe have some suggestions?

				yeah bro, wait a little longer&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp;You should really pm the vendor before you do anything, and ask them (nicely) to explain what might be the problem...odds on a busy vendor wont know there&#039;s a problem until YOU tell them&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; All good vendors will respond quickly to any queries ... relax, and things will&nbsp; be fine&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Youalso&nbsp; really should have pm&#039;d the vendor before ordering, just to say hello and check to see with them if ordering a few ounces would be ok ... maybe they have a limit on the amount they&#039;ll allow in escrow, with new customers&nbsp; :-\
