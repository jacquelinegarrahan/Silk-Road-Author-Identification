				I am a new customer. I just setup the TorBrowser, I also downloaded Bitcoin Wallet on my laptop and cell phone. I cannot figure out who to use to buy Bitcoins, I setup an account with [CENSORED: spam link].com because it looks simple to use. Any other suggestions on who to use besides this website? I can&#039;t figure out how many Bitcoins buy based on what&#039;s in my cart ฿3.3714. Once I make a deposit to buy Bitcoins how do I trade them so I&nbsp; can purchase whats in my cart?

				&#039;local bitcoins&#039; is a website which works as an escrow for p2p bitcoin buys/sales.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed but the address you keep writing keeps getting censored.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for anonymously buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				probably buy $400 cash worth of BTC just in case a dramatic swing in BTC you&#039;ll have extra fees are crazy sometimes and a lot of places recently shut down for a while and a strange coincidence.
