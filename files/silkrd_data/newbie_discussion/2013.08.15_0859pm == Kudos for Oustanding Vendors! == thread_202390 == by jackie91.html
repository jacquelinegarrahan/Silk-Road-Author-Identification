				There are clearly defined classes of sellers on SR. Some are OK, some are terrible and others are Outstanding. This isn&#039;t always accurately reflected in their rating numbers. I want to bring attention to superior vendors. The following are vendors who I have had continued superior transactions with.<br /><br />CryptoKeeper- BTC for reload packs..A real professional, completely trustworthy, stays late to assist buyers, very responsive, always respectful. Super Seller!<br />Anonymart- Weed, hash, related products..Super fast shipping, extremely responsive, superb quality to price ratio, very respectful and polite. Super Seller!<br />Ayeseadee1080- Weed, coke, meth, H..My first vendor, helped a clueless noob get settled, superb quality products, very responsive, respects and protects his buyers, totally reliable and trustworthy. Super Seller!<br />Diamorphius-Opiates..Fastest shipping I have ever seen, all my orders shipped same day as ordered, perfect responsiveness in communications, treats buyers with respect, quality products at good prices. Super Seller!

				+1 <br /><br />Going beyond the feedback system to the forums to publicly recognize a vendor is the best thing you can do to recognize vendors.&nbsp; Kudos

				+1 on the good idea.&nbsp; While vendors have their individual feedback threads, it&#039;s nice to have a repository post where I can go and see an overall list of vendors that people have had good experiences with.<br /><br />For me, two that have been outstanding are:<br /><br />Tessellated - his LSD is just seriously tops, shipping was fast even though it crossed over from Canada to the States, stealth was awesome, and he has been nothing but friendly, responsive, and accommodating.&nbsp; If he was in stock when I ordered last, I wouldn&#039;t have even looked at anyone else.&nbsp; You may pay a small premium for his goods, but I can promise you they are WELL worth what you pay.<br /><br />ForeverJung - No longer sells RCs, but his stealth was good and shipping was fast.&nbsp; If I had any need for mailed cannabis products I&#039;d try him out, but I don&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />I recently placed an order with JerseyCow, and while it hasn&#039;t gotten here yet (understandable, international), it went from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit&quot; in less than 4 hours.&nbsp; Certainly above and beyond in that regard, and if what I&#039;m hearing about his LSD is true, there won&#039;t be anything but awesome things to say about this vendor.

				This post came back to me when I started to see that vendor quality seems to be dropping off. Probably just my imagination but it seems like it&#039;s harder and harder to find a good number of vendors who stand out from the crowd. I&#039;ve been having trouble getting PMs answered, orders sit in processing for days and just now a vendor lied to me and swore he sent my order Express. It is way past Express delivery envelope (3 days) and I will know it wasn&#039;t sent Express when I receive it. Why lie about it?<br /><br />

				I have a couple to add:<br />Mario&#039;s Gram Shoppe: Cannabis and the occasional coke. The coke prices are phenomenal for excellent coke, the service is top-notch, always in transit the same day it&#039;s ordered or next day at the latest. Excellent stealth and great comms. Super Seller!<br />BCPLTD: Coke, sells in .1g increments. Product is consistently good. Requires FE but has never let a buyer down. He has been a vendor for a long time and every one of his orders have been received. He is the exception to the NEVER FE rule. He has like 18 pages of reviews and not one of them says they didn&#039;t get their order. Shipping is free (First Class only) but it has never taken more than 4 days for me to get my order and it is always shipped same day or next day. Super Seller!

				Extraordinary vendors are rare, and I completely agree we should be celebrating our friends who take the risk and deliver the goods. My soul overfloweth with gratitude to the professionals I have had the pleasure of doing business with. Here are some I look forward to dealing with in the future!<br /><br />Mrouid - Best deal ever on clean speed pills, less than 2 day intl. shipment, best stealth I&#039;ve seen on SR.<br />Envious - Rare and potent psychedelics and reputation speak for themselves.<br />Nawlins - Great quality RCs and fast reliable shipping.<br />Angelina - Legit, fast scrips and SUPER friendly service.<br />Mushbud - Who else offers 10+ grams of good shrooms for 25$?? 2-3 day service over the border.<br />Fiber optic - Moar great RCs! Very reliable, with effective stealth.<br />Family - Never been treated so like family by a dealer. Bomb ass stuff.<br />Chem4coin - Well known as a phenomenal dealer of prescription and some of the the best deals on benzos.<br /><br />If you look them up, you&#039;ll notice these are all 5.0 sellers, and have been around a while. They&#039;ve earned it. For you new folks not wanting to get scammed, this is the kind of reputation/longevity you should be researching for. The forums are full of REAL feedback, so you shouldn&#039;t ever have to deal with scammer BS.

				AmsterdamDrugs is such an awesome vendor, I had to FE since this would be&nbsp; my first order on the road but I didn`t mind that. I had read his reviews and when I messaged him he seemed like a decent and down to earth guy. He said that my order would arrive next day and it did, the product was a bit overweight which was nice of him. He also replies in an hour or so, you don`t have to wait long for a response. The quality of his product was also very good. Guys like him make me happy that I`ve found silkroad, I don`t have to deal with sketchy dealers anymore. <br /><br />

				ReD EyE has consistently good charas hash and excellent customer service.<br /><br />bomesweetbome is a leading supplier of NBOMe and has their customer service well sorted.<br /><br />Meerkovo has some of the best &quot;fishscale&quot; cocaine around, period and is a pleasure to deal with. They also sell mid grade bulk hash I&#039;ve not tried.<br /><br />Hope these few helped I&#039;ve dealt with many more vendors and 99% of them are great, it just pays to do a little homework before you make a purchase and it will lead to better, safer use of this wonderful resource that is SR :)<br /><br />

				can&#039;t find my initial review so here&#039;s another one:<br /><br /><br />Mushbud was the first vendor I did business with. I got a bunch of mushrooms, I think it was 7 or 8g for like 30 bucks! Shrooms were ground into powder and vac-sealed. I put them into capsules. Great stealth, product arrived quickly, and I had a blast! Trip was very smooth, I probably reached a high-end +++. Visuals were astounding. I kept looking at this one painting in my room, some houses on an autumn landscape- after 2 or 3 hours into the trip this thing was COMPLETELY unrecognizable.&nbsp; Kept seeing infinite dimensions inside the painting, houses changed into swirling vortexes... it was awesome.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend Mushbud for just about anyone looking to get into psychedelics.<br /><br />Now waiting on something from cubesalesman7600, should be here this week.&nbsp; Things going well so far. Will update on reception

				I am especially happy to hear about the vendors who were kind, patient and honest with first time buyers. Newbies are obviously the easiest marks for unscrupulous vendors and I personally got ignored and insulted by vendors I asked for help from when I was trying to make my first purchase. The vendors who take the time to educate new buyers and give them a memorable first experience are not only excellent vendors but excellent people too ( a rare combination!) and they are the ones who really help SR grow and develop a positive reputation. I wish I could give them all +100 karma. Instead I just give them all the business I can.
