				I just snorted ~40mg of methamphetamine and I&#039;m really not feeling much at all. I feel a little jittery and I feel a little more focus, but no euphoria, no mood lift, no nothing. Is this supposed to happen? Is this all there is to a meth high? This is my first time by the way.

				I&#039;ve only tried meth once. At the time I did a lot of coke, and was expecting something at least somewhat similar. I got the needle to the brain feeling when i snorted it, and was more awake and jittery. Other than that I also had no euphoria, nothing special for me.... I thought i didn&#039;t do enough but I was with experienced users who did the same amount and said they were feeling great. My girlfiend used it the first time along with me, and she said she liked it too, but I didn&#039;t see what all the hype was about.....

				The meth finally kicked in I think. I feel really motivated, clear, and restless. I don&#039;t want to sit anymore, and I want to lots of things.&nbsp; :)
