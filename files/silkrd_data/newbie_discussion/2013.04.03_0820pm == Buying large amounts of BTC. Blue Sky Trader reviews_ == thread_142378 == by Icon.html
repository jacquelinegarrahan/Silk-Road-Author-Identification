				Hello everyone, I wanted to get some reviews of people who have bought BTC through Blue Sky Traders. <br /><br />Has anyone bought BTC in the ranges of 20+ BTC recently and who would have recommendations or advice for making large purchases? Who has used Blue Sky Traders? <br /><br />

				Not to be a dick, but I really don&#039;t trust buying BTC from someone who hasn&#039;t been on the forums all that longer than myself. I cannot use your services.<br /><br />I&#039;m specifically looking for people who have used Blue Sky Traders. As you could imagine if you going to go dump lots of money into someone else&#039;s bank account, you would be a damn fool not to see how people felt about using their services.

				I recently bought about 500$ worth of BTC off of them and it was SUPER simple. I will be purchasing 10 BTC(at current price) or more soon, and I will use them again.

				I was gonna try them the other day but their site was down.&nbsp; I ended up using bitfloor.com instead.&nbsp; It was easy and super quick.&nbsp; Just a cash deposit at Bank of America.&nbsp; No ID or name required.&nbsp; Just fill out a deposit slip and give the teller cash.&nbsp; I got the confirmation email on my phone before I was even out the door.&nbsp; Then when I got home, traded the cash into BitCoin and instant payout to the address of your choice.<br /><br />Of course, I didn&#039;t get near the amount you&#039;re talking about... less than $100 worth.

				I have used Blue Sky traders in the past with ZERO problems. I think I bought around $200 worth of coins from them. 2 Weeks ago I was gonna buy some more through Blue Sky Traders but they were down so I ended up going with BitFloor. All I had to do is deposit the money into a Bank Of America, I had my coins in a couple of hours with no problems.
