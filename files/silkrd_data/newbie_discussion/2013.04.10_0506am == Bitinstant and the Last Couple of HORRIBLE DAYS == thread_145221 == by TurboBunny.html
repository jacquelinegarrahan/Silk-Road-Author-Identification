				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~ Friendly Public Service Announcement ~&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :o<br /><br />Ive been following The Bitinstant cluster fuck very closely for the last couple of days as I myself have been looking recently to making my first bitcoin purchase, and while i may be a newb to buying bitcoin I am no noob in the world of researching what I am getting into, actually &quot;listening&quot; to what people are saying&nbsp; , and understanding what is going on.<br /><br />All i can say now is it &quot;sounds&quot; as if Bitinstant are a bunch of frauds at &quot;current&quot;, there are conspiracy theories flying all over reddit, from them not having the actual money to transfer, to transactions being lost entirely, to the system being fucked after the hacking that occurred... see below. <br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/03/digital-thieves-pull-off-12000-bitcoin-heist/<br /><br />I think its all related, maybe there randomly choosing transactions to lose/hold to remake the lost money (as in they deposit your money in THERE account at current exchange and make your profit as values increase ), maybe their system is comprised, maybe they were not prepared for the influx of volume, whatever the case may be what matters is that currently A LOT of people are missing money and all they are doing is lieing more and more, and theres not a whole lot we can do to hold them accountable ( its cryptocurrency), and it hurts to say, they know it... ( I heard a figure on Sunday that 12,000+ people were waiting on cash&nbsp; transfer verifications from BitInstant to Mtgox )&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />The forum over at reddit is a variable mass complaint forum<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c08ju/we_can_trust_bitinstant_again_fyi_bitinstant_is/<br /><br />^ this is a lie tho, scroll down to see the mass complaints filing in<br /><br />As well as the official Bitinstant Support Bitcoin forum at<br /><br />&nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.0<br /><br /><br />To save you the reading (but with the provided sources) you can see the droves of individuals listing full account details, transaction dates, funds transferred looking for help and then the Bitinstant Support Techs lieing about &quot; Manually Pushing Thru&quot; their transactions. As the same individuals who have been told thee funds are being pushed thru are still waiting 18+hrs later. They are trying to save face but it may be too late...<br /><br />I for one am Sorry to hear this, as i was excited for the ease of cash to BTC<br />Anyone else know a good cash to mtgox route?<br /><br />If you have had direct first hand experience with BI in the last week we would love to hear your story...<br /><br />
