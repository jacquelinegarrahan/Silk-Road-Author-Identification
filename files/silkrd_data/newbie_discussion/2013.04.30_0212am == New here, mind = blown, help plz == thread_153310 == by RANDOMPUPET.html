				Slow down there tex. Don&#039;t go off all half cocked, yer libel to get waylaid!<br /><br />Do your research. The fact that you don&#039;t know how to get bitcoins alone is enough reason for you to unload Tor and stay away until you know more.

				The site&#039;s safe, though obviously down for right now. Bitcoins turned out to be far more of a bitch than I had thought they were. We still doing the bitinstant thing? Last I had to get bitcoins there was a way to annonymously make a cash deposit into a bank account at a specific chain store and they&#039;d know it was you by the exact amount you were depositing. Shit could take a couple of days, so you should deposit a decent amount of money. But uh... yeah, there&#039;s always more you can learn about security and the like. But it seems like the most dangerous way of doing business on the SR is safer than street purchases. There&#039;s probably even a way to buy them directly in the services part of the website, but from what I understand a lot of those people are gonna rip you off, so check with the forums. It can be complicated, I know. But it&#039;s worth it.<br /><br />What&#039;re you gonna buy first?
