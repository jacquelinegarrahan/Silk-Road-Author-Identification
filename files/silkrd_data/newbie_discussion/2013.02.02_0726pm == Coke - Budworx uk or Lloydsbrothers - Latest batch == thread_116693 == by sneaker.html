				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to purchase some coke UK to UK and would like to hear from anyone who has tried the latest batch from either Budworx uk or Lloydsbrothers.&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched the forum and read their reviews but wanted some replies from people who have bought recently.&nbsp; I hear the quality of both is quite high for the UK.&nbsp; Has anyone compared the two?&nbsp; Which would you go for?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Sneaks.

				hey dudes<br />I can vouch for Lloydsbrothers. good clean gear and you only need small doses (so it will last you longer), and come down is good.&nbsp; <br />It arrived on the other side of the world in 8 days. great package and stealth.<br />I&#039;m going to try Budworx next as I like the feedback and the description of his batch.&nbsp; I also like how it is free of the controversial agent - levamisole.&nbsp; Both vendors prices are higher however think about how it will last you longer as your dosage is pretty much half what you would usually take.<br /><br />Happy Easter peeps...party safe!

				Just received from Budworx a few days ago.&nbsp; Very good stealth, not that it matters to you considering you&#039;re buying domestic. It was excellent, not mindblowingly&nbsp; amazing but good enough that you forget you&#039;ve taken it have a great night and come home to discover loads left in your pocket.&nbsp; Seemed pretty clean and unspeedy too.

				Expecting a batch from both. I&#039;m thinking of mixing it all together so I can rate them both equally :)
