				and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...

				You are partially right.&nbsp; I bent over, but I didn&#039;t ask him to fuck me.&nbsp; I guess I was &quot;asking for it&quot;.<br /><br />NOW I GOT THE PROOF IN MY INBOX.&nbsp; BY HIS OWN WORDS, HE KEEPS HIS BUYERS INFO.&nbsp; ANY PROBLEMS AND HE THREATENS YOU WITH THE FED AND LOCAL LE.

				I&#039;m sorry that this has happened to you ... please make sure you use the &quot;Report this vendor&quot; link on the vendor&#039;s profile.&nbsp; You won&#039;t receive any money back from any deals outside of the escrow system, but you can at least report the fact that he keeps buyer info and uses it to threaten people.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;ll save someone else from the same experience.

				The whole point of SR is to provide a method for people to buy and sell stuff for large quantities of money while remaining anonymous. Why you would go outside that to send money directly to some anonymous dude is the problem.<br />

				I, too, recently received my order from Liston. I have ordered a few times before and it has always come quick and with exceptional, albeit simple, stealth, they rarely even break. Although the most recent time it was in a package labeled with something that made me believe it did not come from the US where the listing says it does. ( I do not want to reveal what was on the package for his protection and as SR advises not to give away info like that.)<br /><br />I trust him but Id prefer a little less sketchy packaging. But he has never asked me to FE, never shorted me, and never emailed me outside SR. <br />I like him better than Googleyed :) <br /><br />The threatening email he allegedly sent you about ratting you out seems unlike him and unlike most vendors, in light of recent events, [see Astonmarteen thread] Scout knows what i am talking about, but you can&#039;t believe everything you hear/see. <br /><br />-JOS
