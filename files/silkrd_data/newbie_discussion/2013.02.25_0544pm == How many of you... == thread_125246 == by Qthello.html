				Hmm... favourite cartoon... Thats tough.

Or, if you don&#039;t think it should be legalized, what is the main reason you are against it?

				I think it should be legal, as anything on here, because I am an adult and It is up to me to protect me from the shit I do. And speaking for myself. I do not want to see it legal in my state. Med use sure. But not legal. Right now, the only thing I cannot do is have weed. I can smoke it, smell like it, sell it, share it. Do whatever I want. It&#039;s just illegal if I have any. And I never do ;), But, I always smell like it. Which is not illegal.&nbsp; The gov&#039;t in Col and Wash are doing it because they think that green on those tree means money. But, being the only two stats that can do it. It will be tourism money. not much importing and exporting.<br /><br />Now. I would foremost like to see hemp legal first. That is where the money is. it&#039;s not in recreational use. Those two states are going to make money on the novelty idea, that anyone in the states can relax in their state and smoke &quot;freely&quot;. Like gambling in NV. The money is not in the female plant. It is in the male plant. bio plastics, paper. You all know the applications that this plant can be able to processed into, both male and female plants. The money as I said is in hemp.

				I would not know what match.com threads look like, as I have never been. I am sure you could find a hook up here though if you looked. It was just a way to pass some time and get your spam in. Me, I like random topics, debating topics and conversating with others, as what a forum is for. <br /><br />Good day sir! I said good day! =p

				It was suppose to be someone answer the previous question then ask another, and have someone answer it. <br /><br />CArtoons for me, American dad. I have been watching the same episodes my hdd and netflix for the past 2 years.

				They were the chip, and they were fucking Oboisterus! I will let someone else get the chance to answer the chemical question. The pizza ones I remember, I was not a huge fan. It was the flavor of them, I liked the texture. I will say this though. 5th avenues...that is all.
