				Chief is a awsome vendor so far, waiting till he gets his awsome fishsscale in stock to place a order but even the small sample i recieved so far was good :)<br /><br />STEALH is probly the BEST out of any canadian vendor, especially if you got better shipping than just regular mail, youd be set.... no worries at all its so well packaged :) thats a promise from one fiend to another.....<br /><br />hes quick as shit too to ship it out, if it says in transit that will mean its actually in transit, not like other vendors who put ti in the mail 3 days later etc....<br /><br />very friendly bisnessman, treat him nice with respect and he will show you the same *i think this is the most important aspect* ive came across to many vendros who come accross as rude n liek you owe them something, this isnt street dealing lol you start relationships that are ment too last forever.... so you can buy in confidence :)<br /><br />cant wait to try his Disintegration Mdma pills,&nbsp; ive done some mdma pills before that were .2mg but never with Caffeine and Vitamin-B12 added to the mix, cant wait too se how that plays into the effect :)<br />&nbsp;ill let you guys know how good these pills are when i recieve mine asap :) and i know my shit haha i can assure you that ;)

				I was recently lucky enough to acquire a Disintegration 200mg MDMA Capsule Sample from Nativechief and here&#039;s my review:<br /><br />Shipping 5/5- the sample arrived in 3 business days domestic and the product was intact.<br /><br />Stealth 5/5- great stealth, vacuum sealed and very discreet<br /><br />Communication 5/5- Nativechief replied to my message incredibly fast and fulfilled my request.<br /><br />Product 5/5- This MDMA was fucking FANTASTIC! I probably had the best night of my life rolling on this stuff. The MDMA took about 20-30 minutes before i started feeling the effects and the roll lasted for 4-5 hours. I had strong feelings of euphoria, love, and empathy. This would be great for rolling with a girl or at a concert. I highly recommend this product to everyone and I will probably be buying 5 caps in the future.<br /><br />Thanks again nativechief for allowing me to review your product! <br /><br />Product url:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f7e6d4ada5

				Just wanted to update regarding my disintegration cap sample!<br /><br />Shipping 5/5 - came in three days domestic, no issues<br /><br />Stealth 5/5 - looked like regular mail, used MBB, no feel of capsule through the packaging<br /><br />Product 5/5 - took me a while to try it as I don&#039;t use MDMA too often. A friend and I split the capsule and I was happy to see it packed with delicious shards when I opened it. I thought it was interesting that it contained caffeine as well which gave it a nice lift that MDMA on it&#039;s own doesn&#039;t have. Both my friend and I had wiggly eyes and heavy rushes of euphoria which means the product was excellent, seeing as we both have a decent tolerance to the stuff and it can take up to 150 mgs of average MDMA to get there. <br /><br />Overall 5/5 - NativeChief is an excellent new vendor, use with confidence!&nbsp;

				I really wanted to share my experience in buying from NativeChief, since it is such an enigma of a story when it comes to vendors on the SR. A few weeks ago, I placed an order with the Chief for a couple of his Oxycontin 80mg pills and was pleasantly surprised when the Chief sent me a message with a status update of my order and a tracking number less then 24 hours after I placed the order. When my order arrived, I excitedly sampled half a pill (which usually has me TOO high), but I didn&#039;t feel anything. I waited for another 1-2 hours before deciding to take the other half of the pill, which also had zero effect. I quickly became frustrated and had taken 4 entire pills of the &quot;Oxycontin 80mg&quot; in a matter of 6-8hrs and had still not felt a single thing from them. I had instantly felt like I had been ripped off and sold fake pills. <br /><br />I thought all the money I had spent on these pills was for nothing, but I decided I would at least message NativeChief to tell him my experience/thoughts. I was incredibly shocked when the Chief replied to me in a matter of hours (I didn&#039;t expect him to reply at all!) and Chief told me that he had no idea that these pills were fake/defective, but he would make it right to me. I noticed that these pills were quickly pulled from his listings, which shows to me that he has not intention of ripping people off.<br /><br />I was incredibly surprised when NativeChief re-shipped me a bunch of his 20mg pms-oxycodone pills along with a bunch of his #4 afghan heroin, all of which were FREE OF ANY CHARGE!! (both products are absolutely awesome btw!) I&#039;m still quite shocked at this entire happening, but I can tell you that I will be a loyal customer of NativeChief&#039;s from now on.

				After FE on all occasions (2 at over $700) NC really is a vendor you can trust. His product is of a standard you would expect from someone who is in this for the long haul. Stealth packaging is of a very high standard and communication is impeccable.<br /><br />SC

				You have to hand it to Native Chief for making a slow release 200mg MDMA cap! WOW says me!<br />Vendors would ask themselves why do 200mg, more than 120-150mg is serious overkill<br />for most people... it just wouldn&#039;t be enjoyable too intense!, too much up and down. <br /><br />Native chief is all about the science of happy and customer satisfaction!!! Seriously MSG him for<br />2 min. and you&#039;ll see what I mean or better still... try his 200mg disintegration MDMA cap!<br />He dared to fine tune the experience by putting it in a slow release format to help <br />keep the energy coming and smooth out the entire experience with a regulated release <br />capsule, a mod-low dose of caffeine and a mod-high dose B-12.&nbsp; I don&#039;t work for him or have any<br />affiliation, he&#039;s just smart and and a perfectionist type worthy of trust and respect which is manifest<br />in every single aspect of his game... I wish he owned a pro sport team or a horse so I could make money<br />&#039;&#039;gambling&#039;&#039; on him.&nbsp; It&#039;s no gamble!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just received my first order from NativeChief. I Finalized Early as I had never done business with NativeChief and had only been on SR for a couple of weeks. My buying experience was excellent and I look forward to placing additional orders with him in the near future. Communication was prompt and professional. Delivery speed was exceptional and took only two business days. Receiving my order so rapidly was a big plus. Shipping was discrete and well protected. All items were intact without any breakage, and were exactly as described.&nbsp;
