				I have friends that go to school with Jared and they say he is innocent. What do you think?<br /><br />Jared with the Archbishop - torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/eksT.jpg<br /><br />Jared at Epiphany - torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/mR3F.jpg<br /><br />Jared&#039;s mugshot - torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/1Ypa.jpg<br /><br />Jared&#039;s other mugshot - torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/xsZU.jpg<br /><br />&nbsp;A Tarpon Springs High student who was a winner of the 2012 cross dive during the city&#039;s Greek Orthodox Epiphany celebration has been arrested on suspicion of sexually battering an intoxicated 15-year-old girl during a house party last week, police said.<br /><br />Tarpon police said Jared Alissandratos, 17, has been charged with the sexual battery of a physically incapacitated girl, a first-degree felony that carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted.<br /><br />According to a police report, Alissandratos admitted having sex with his accuser, though it is unclear whether he believed it was consensual at the time.<br /><br />Charges against two other boys, both under 18 and also Tarpon High students, are being reviewed by the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney&#039;s Office for possible prosecution, Tarpon Springs police Capt. Jeff Young said. It is unclear what role the other two boys played, but police said in a statement that the victim &#039;was reportedly taken advantage of by possibly three males.&#039; The case has been amplified by a flurry of social media activity. Tarpon Springs teens have taken to Twitter to discuss the case, many decrying Alissandratos&#039; arrest and directing obscene remarks at the girl who accused him.<br /><br />You&#039;re about to ruin someones life for something he didn&#039;t even do , one Twitter user wrote. Another wrote, Its f--ked up what she did to you man i am truly sorry for you.<br /><br />At least some comments appeared to address the police investigation. One user wrote, we didn&#039;t (do) anything No one talk to those cops #weKnowOurRights and If u haven&#039;t personally spoke to the cops or aren&#039;t close with Jared or anyone involved then don&#039;t involve urself. Trust me .<br /><br />The #freejared tag was busy with commenters Wednesday and Thursday, with some people talking about making &#039;Free Jared&#039; T-shirts.<br /><br />Alissandratos himself took to Twitter the day after the alleged sexual battery, posting a photo of four empty liquor bottles with the message, What happend last night.<br /><br />The vivid Twitter discussion of the incident is reminiscent of the social media activity around the rape last year of an intoxicated teenage girl by two boys in Steubenville, Ohio. That case also led to furious Web debate over rape allegations, with many criticizing the boys&#039; accuser. Last month, both of boys were convicted.<br /><br />Alissandratos is part of a prominent Tarpon Springs family. He was one of four cross retrievers during the city&#039;s prominent Epiphany celebration on Jan. 6, 2012. The contest, in which boys of Greek descent vie to retrieve a cross thrown into Spring Bayou, is part of the annual daylong religious festival. Alissandratos&#039; father, Aleck, is a longtime co-chair of the dive.<br /><br />According to an arrest affidavit, the incident took place at a party last Friday night at Aleck Alissandratos&#039; two-story, $380,000 home. Young, the Tarpon police official, said the party was attended by eight to 20 people at different times, and no adults were present.<br /><br />The arrest affidavit states that alcohol was at the party and that &#039;the victim became extremely intoxicated and was taken to a room to lay down.&#039; According to the affidavit, Jared Alissandratos entered the room and began having sex with her, an act he later &#039;admitted&#039; to investigators.<br /><br />&#039;The victim did not give consent to the defendant(s) to have sex, and the victim was not able to give consent due to her level of intoxication,&#039; the affidavit states.<br /><br />The girl reported it to an officer at Tarpon Springs High on Monday, Young said. He said other charges or arrests could still come.<br /><br />http://tampabaytimes.fl.newsmemory.com/rss.php?date=20130419&amp;edition=tbt*&amp;subsection=tbt*&amp;page=04192013tbt008t.pdf.0&amp;id=art_0.xml&amp;device=<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Most of Tarpon has heard about the recent arrest and rape allegation in Tarpon Springs concerning a 15-year-old high school girl and a 17-year-old high school student named Jared Alissandratos.<br /><br />This story has torn Tarpon Springs High School in two, some students supporting the popular cross retriever, while others refusing to excuse the crime.<br /><br />Bullying, intimidation and ignorance has swept through social media, with #freejared trending on Twitter and lewd posts calling the victim a “slut,” among other more disgusting things. This issue is not anything new, though, and goes far beyond this case. Rape culture has now been shown to be here in Tarpon Springs as well, and it is up to students, teachers and parents to address it.<br /><br />Rape culture is defined as a culture where rape and sexual violence are the norm and where attitudes and norms excuse, tolerate or even condone rape. It looks at how society objectifies women, and makes them out to be objects to be taken advantage of. If you don&#039;t believe this is an issue, even here in Tarpon Springs look no further than Twitter and read the posts under #freejared.<br /><br />“‪#freejared your innocent bro, everyone knows it, she cant lie forever”<br /><br />“You just f****d up your life and his, good job ��. ‪#freejared”<br /><br />“Teen raped at tarpon springs house party&quot; that&#039;s f*****g b******t. I dont know him but ‪#freejared&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t know who he is, but my sister goes to school with him. I know he didn&#039;t do it ‪#freejared”<br /><br />“F**k Da police ‪#freejared”<br /><br />&quot;just face it... You&#039;re a slut ‪#freejared!!!!”<br /><br />This is not OK, Tarpon Springs. Parents and teachers, these are your kids posting this. I am the first to say innocent until proven guilty, but what we see here on these posts are excuses because he is popular, and they are blaming the victim. Most of these students probably do not know the circumstances of the case, or have even heard of rape culture, but they are exemplifying it to the tee.<br /><br />This 15-year-old student will never be able to go back to Tarpon Springs High School, or ever forget about this experience.<br /><br />These teenagers have, unfortunately, no conception about the sexual assault problem we face here in the United States, thanks mainly to the media who continue to excuse famous stars for allegations against them. Look at today&#039;s music, objectifying women, calling them “hoes, sluts and whores.” Your kids are listening to and learning from this music, and unfortunately in some instances it goes beyond just the listening.<br /><br />Many of the posts I have read from students excuse Jared Alissandratos because the victim was highly intoxicated and she “wanted it.” This 15-year-old girl, while unwise to drink at all, had no ability to consent, and Mr. Alissandratos took advantage of that situation. The pink elephant in the room is why they were drinking at all at the Alissandratos home, and where were the parents?<br /><br />These students are still kids, and should not have easy access to alcohol or especially access to a home to throw a party in. Until parents take responsibility for their own children and their actions, these cases will continue to occur.<br /><br />Rape culture has been exposed to many more people in the area due to this case, and the backlash against the victim is horrible and saddening. As I said earlier, these are your kids, Tarpon Springs, and something must be done to educate them. Parents must take responsibility, and schools must also share the responsibility to educate their students about sexual violence.<br /><br />What really concerns me is the consequence of this bullying and ignorance... All over the country, teen suicide has gone up because of the Internet age. Teen girls either being sexually assaulted, or having their private pictures exposed dive deep into depression. This is the unintended consequence of these kids&#039; actions. But we can prevent that, and prevent the issue from arising at all if we actually try to #endrapeculture.<br /><br />http://tarponsprings.patch.com/blog_posts/rape-culture-exposes-itself-in-tarpon-springs<br /><br /><br />He read the tweets, the derogatory statements about his daughter. And after the fury passed, he crafted a response.<br /><br />The father of the Tarpon Springs High School teen who has accused a male schoolmate of rape said Tuesday that he wrote a nine-paragraph statement to defend her.<br /><br />&quot;Trust me, I wanted to say so much more,&quot; he said. &quot;And I will after the state is done handling the case.&quot;<br /><br />The Tampa Bay Times is withholding his name to protect the identity of his daughter.<br /><br />The accused, 17-year-old Jared Alissandratos, was charged last week with sexually battering an intoxicated 15-year-old girl during a house party.<br /><br />Alissandratos, a winner of the 2012 cross dive during the city&#039;s Greek Orthodox Epiphany celebration, faces a charge of sexual battery of the physically incapacitated girl, a first-degree felony that carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.<br /><br />He admitted having sex with his accuser, a police report said, though it is unclear whether he believed it was consensual.<br /><br />After Alissandratos&#039; arrest, some Tarpon High students took to Twitter, using the hashtag #FreeJared and calling the young victim, among an array of insulting terms, &quot;a liar.&quot; Others lashed back, defending her.<br /><br />The social media melee attracted the loosely organized &quot;hacktivist&quot; group Anonymous, notorious for targeting the FBI, credit card companies and, more recently, apparent rapists. When two football players in Steubenville, Ohio, were accused of rape last year, Anonymous hacked the football team&#039;s website, threatening to disclose personal information.<br /><br />The Tarpon Springs girl&#039;s father said he wanted to clear his daughter&#039;s name without revealing it. This week, he contacted Twitter user &quot;Priest,&quot; who self-identifies as an Anonymous member, to post and publicize the message.<br /><br />&quot;She is not having &#039;next day&#039; regrets,&quot; he wrote in the statement. &quot;It wasn&#039;t until the accused admitted to her what happened that she fully realized the horrific reality of what happened that night.&quot;<br /><br />The father also described disappointment in his daughter&#039;s decisions that night, which, according to police, included underage drinking.<br /><br />&quot;Her lapse in judgment, however, does not condone the actions of the accused,&quot; he wrote.<br /><br />Eventually, he said Tuesday, she will resume her studies at Tarpon High. Once the case is over, he believes, the bullying will stop.<br /><br />http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/after-accusation-of-rape-tarpon-springs-father-defends-daughter/2116898<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t attack this young lady or else.<br /><br />Members of the highly controversial anarchist group Anonymous say their message to Tarpon Springs teens commenting online about a reported rape is just that simple.<br /><br />&quot;All we are trying to do is deflect some of the hate and the anger toward this young lady,&quot; said a man who spoke to ABC Action News over the phone and claimed to be an Anonymous member monitoring Twitter.<br /><br />According to police, a 17-year-old boy raped a 15-year-old girl at an alcohol fueled house party last weekend.&nbsp; The boy told police the sex was consensual but the girl said said she was too intoxicated to consent.<br /><br />ABC Action News is not identifying the boy arrested because he has not been charged as an adult.<br /><br />Shortly after she filed the report and the teen boy was arrested, it became a hot topic around Tarpon Springs High School then on social media.&nbsp; Then came hateful posts on Twitter.&nbsp; The accuser was also called names.&nbsp; Anonymous considers both of those actions to be victim shaming.<br /><br />Meanwhile, support seemingly grows for the accused.&nbsp; Teens are posting pictures of shirts that say FREE (boy&#039;s name) and even created a similar hashtag.<br /><br />&quot;They are putting things out there they&#039;d never want the general public to see,&quot; said the Anonymous member.<br /><br />Friday afternoon, members of the group Tweeted the following message as a warning:&nbsp; &quot;Anonymous is watching every Facebook status you post and Tweet you send.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They&#039;re already documented.&nbsp; We have information from each one, Facebook, Twitter, home addresses, phone numbers, where they&#039;ve been and GPS tags,&quot; the member explained.&nbsp; He added that some of the Tweets were tracked via GPS to certain parts of the high school and have time stamps that prove they were tweeted while school was in session.<br /><br />Anonymous said they&#039;ve been contacting the people leaving hateful comments and telling them the information they have gathered.&nbsp; They claim some deleted their tweets while others refused and &#039;when head to head with the group.&#039;<br /><br />&quot;What it comes down to is what your doing online has real world repercussions,&quot; the member said.<br /><br />The member said they will take online screen shots, their documentation and research to law enforcement, school officials and parents.<br /><br />Anonymous said most parents don&#039;t know what their kids are up to online and are grateful to be contacted.<br /><br />The group told ABC Action News it will go as far as it takes to stop this online hatred.&nbsp; And, this has held true in past high profile teen rape cases they&#039;ve interjected themselves in to.<br /><br />The group discovered and then leaked video of a teen&#039;s rape in Stuebenville, Ohio.&nbsp; They also posted names of the accused on social media resulting in two arrests and then two convictions.<br /><br />They also take credit for the reopening of&nbsp; Rehtaeh Parsons sexual assault case.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Canadian teenager committed suicide following online bullying that apparently stemmed for her reporting that several teenagers raped her.<br /><br />&quot;We got involved in those cases because law enforcement wasn&#039;t doing their job,&quot; Anonymous said.<br /><br />The member said the Tarpon Springs case is different because law enforcement did take swift action.<br /><br />http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/region_pinellas/anonymous-members-say-theyre-monitoring-twitter-for-hateful-comments-about-tarpon-springs-teen

				After the arrest of a Tarpon Springs High School student charged with sexually assaulting a fellow student at a house party, social media sites lit up with comments.<br /><br />Police say 17-year old Jared Alissandratos had sex with the 15-year old girl without her permission. <br /><br />On Twitter, a &quot;freejared&quot; hashtag soon appeared.&nbsp; Someone using that hashtag tweeted:&nbsp; &quot;your innocent bro, everybody knows it. She can&#039;t lie forever.&quot;&nbsp; Several other tweets supporting Alissandratos have disappeared from the site. <br /><br />Dr. Kelli Burns, a social media expert at the University of South Florida, says comments like that one can discourage victims of future crimes from coming forward.<br /><br />&quot;Because they&#039;re worried about the backlash that can happen on social media,&quot; Burns said.&nbsp; &quot;People will jump up and defend the alleged perpetrator of a crime because they&#039;re worried about their friend going to jail.&quot;<br /><br />She says that tweet, and those who support the teen accused in this case, says something about the younger generation.<br /><br />&quot;It kind of makes me think that young people write rape off as not that big of a deal,&quot; said Burns. &quot;Not a crime that warrants being arrested and tried and potential jail time. &quot;<br /><br />Later tweets blasted those who supported Alissandratos.&nbsp; His attorney, Dean Tsourakis, says most people clearly do not know the facts in this case.<br /><br />&quot;The state has assured me that they&#039;re going to do a thorough investigation,&quot; said Tsourakis. &quot;I think if they do a thorough investigation that Mr. Alissandratos will be cleared.&quot;<br /><br />Alissandratos has been released from juvenile detention, but he is wearing an ankle bracelet, so technically he is still in custody.<br /><br />He is not currently attending Tarpon Springs High School.<br /><br />http://www.wfla.com/story/22079349/role-of-social-media-in-tarpon-springs-rape-case

				Last night I was informed about a brand new teenage Tarpon Springs rape case (Yeah, another one) and this time it is out of Florida. Jared Alissandratos , 17, has been charged with the sexual battery of a physically incapacitated girl. This is a first degree felony that can carry a 30-year prison sentence if he is convicted. According to the report, charges against two other boys,&nbsp; who are both under the age of 18 and also students at Tarpon High, are being forwarded to the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney’s Office for review and possible prosecution.<br /><br />It’s the same old story we have heard so many times over the last few months. Girl sneaks off to a party where no adults are present , drinks too much, is taken to a quite room to sleep it off and is then sexually assaulted. The Allisandratos are well known in the community, and Jared is known as being “very popular” and “cute.” According to neighbor Nancy Ward , there are frequent house parties at this waterfront home belonging to Jared’s father where there are no adults present, but plenty of alcohol. Another example of some excellent parenting.<br /><br />I was contacted by a family member of the alleged victim last night and we spoke about the Tarpon Springs rape case. The victim, who is a 15-year-old, is doing okay but is being shielded from social media and the outrageous amount of bullying, slut-shaming, and rampant support of the alleged rapist.These Tarpon High teens are not the smartest bunch. Just reading through their tweets I was able to see their cell phone numbers posted, photographs of their family members, their cheerleading schedules, and a whole lot of them who enjoy getting “majorly fucked up” on “booze and weed.” I have kindly edited their names out (and you Tarpon high parents should thank me for this, because your little princelings and princesses might want to be aware most of the world doesn’t talk to kindly to this level of nasty cyber-bullying), but anyone can easily find these kids on Twitter and watch their underage drunken Vine videos.<br /><br />http://www.mommyish.com/2013/04/19/tarpon-springs-rape-case/
