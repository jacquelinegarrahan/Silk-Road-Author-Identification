				I have been since middle of May on SR. <br />It is there where I have discovered a new currency for myself - a bitcoin&nbsp; :)<br />I have been reading different stories about it: it has not always been with such a rate in relation to US Dollar as it is now: e.g. people claiming to pay in earlier times 15 BTC for a gramm of MDMA.<br />Anyway I have been wondering what is happing in the last time to bitcoin? why it loses its value? <br />Is there sense to buy now some BTC or is it better to wait?<br /><br /><br />

				I was wondering the same thing as I only discovered this cool new currency about the same time you did. Don&#039;t know if there&#039;s any correlation but silver dropped significantly around the same time bitcoins dropped

				btc started of cheap made it self steady at about 5/6 dollars for a while then started a slow but steady rise to about 100 dollars, for a while then went nuts a few months ago somewhere at the region of 230 dollars per btc then a rapid decline to about 120 dollars then since then on a slow decline over last month 6 weeks.<br /><br />But thats from memory and since its inception so its a vage reply so to speak, some one might come in with the whole history soon or ya can go research it your self..<br /><br />
