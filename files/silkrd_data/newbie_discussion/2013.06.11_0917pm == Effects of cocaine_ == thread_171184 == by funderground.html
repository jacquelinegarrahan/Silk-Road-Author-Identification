				Hello fellow roaders. I&#039;m looking for some first hand accounts of the effects of cocaine, either cut or &quot;pure.&quot; Also looking for advice on how to snort. <br /><br />&#039;ve ordered from 4 or 5 different well known and well liked cocaine vendors on SR (a couple rated at %83+ purity). I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m doing something wrong or if there&#039;s something wrong with my nose, but with all of the orders that I&#039;ve received I feel no great effect. There is numbing and a very subtle euphoria.. Is that all I should be expecting? Back when I use to order locally I would get this slightly speedy and on top of the world feeling which I had assumed was what C&#039;s effects really were. I&#039;m guessing now that it was probably cuts/speed/caffeine that made me feel that way.. I&#039;m looking for that wide awake feeling, and I&#039;m not getting it :( Is coke in general a very mellow high?<br /><br />I&#039;m also concerned I may be snorting it wrong. I&#039;ve been using saline to keep my nose from drying out. I usually snort the line and then snort again to get the coke all the way up there, let it sit, and then in a couple minutes I feel the drip. Is it possible that the effects just aren&#039;t being absorbed? I&#039;m at a loss for what&#039;s going on.

				You should NOT get all jittery and paranoid with good C . You SHOULD feel wide awake and energetic but in a nice smooth way, not a geeky gacky way. Don&#039;t know what else to tell ya, sounds like yer snorting right, thats really kinda hard to fuck up. Who have you bought from??? How much and how long did it last? If you say you got a 1/4G that lasts 4 days of everyday, allday use, I&#039;d say your not doing enough&nbsp; . <br />I&#039;ve bought from quite a few on SR, thats why I ask, I can at least tell ya ,&quot; so n so has always sent me proper C&quot;.

				shouldn&#039;t be a drip, probably a reaction to cuts, almost always get some congestion after though<br />for &quot;wide awake&quot; maybe try snorting ritalin, be very careful though since it takes longer to work and keeps working much longer<br />rtialin and cocaine are actually very similar in structure<br />

				Hello funderground.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in your post and feel personally you may not have had great cocaine.<br /><br />The feeling (of good gear) is a pleasant lift - depending on how much/tolerance etc to a good, solid high - alert, responsive, focussed...possibly creative and engaging in the right context. Certainly heightened senses and an ability to think quickly is often the mark of good, clean coke.<br /><br />The speedy is likely a cut...as are the drips. Again good quality rarely causes these.<br /><br />I recommend seeking a far purer form from a good vendor...not marketing myself...but there are a fair few with very good product here - read reviews and feedback to identify the good ones :)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc

				Ya, if you are all jittery then it is probably cut pretty good.&nbsp; Like you said, you should have a feeling of being on top of the world.&nbsp; On good coke you will be wide awake but you should still be able to relax and focus.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought blow from 3 vendors who said they had high quality stuff and 2 of them had bullshit and one was okay.&nbsp; I would bet the stuff you&#039;re getting isn&#039;t very good because if it was good I think you would know it.

				Some like that jittery, speedy cut C, it&#039;s what they know. I am in no way trashing this vendors C , but , I found MarloStanfield to have C that leaned toward that kinda C. Prices are some of the best on SR and it;s just a little speedier than what I like but you might love it. It&#039;s far from the real shitty , street , crap which is over the top jittery, just a bit more than I like, but it might be right up yer alley . Might wanna check him out , and , like I said, prices ore great in comparison tosome others.

				What you describe sounds to me like youve been getting decent to good blow, the shit that you recall from the streets was more likely than not hit with amphet.

				(just saying) still buzzing though<br />got a gram thru a local street guy last night: sharp rockies, breaking easy, chop-chop nice with a sharp blade.<br />no wet, no oily, goes in with a slight burn, half a gram got me going for until 7 am.<br />no congestion no discharge, got up at 1pm and done half a gram by 4 pm with no burn, no hot flashes, no palpitations.<br />anyways, the thing was $80, and when i see some clowns saying &quot;it&#039;s of the brick&quot; for $150 and it ends up being garbage, i&#039;d better go and give my granma a hug
