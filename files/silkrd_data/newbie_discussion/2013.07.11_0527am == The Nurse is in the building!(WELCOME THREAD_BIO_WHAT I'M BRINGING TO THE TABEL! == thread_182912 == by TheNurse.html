				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who are you and what is your business on this website??<br /><br />Hello I am nurse Nicole, you may address me as &#039;&#039;The Nurse.&#039;&#039; Now If you haven&#039;t guessed by now yes I am a up and coming pharmaceutical company who is wanting to bring my love and offerings to the good people of the road! I have a stern belief that what I am doing is in fact helping people with problems who really need these products but can&#039;t afford to get them offline due to overpricing and horrible economic state.&nbsp; What I hope to bring to all of you is great quality products ranging from my&nbsp; usual pharmaceutical such as medical marijuana, medical THC wax, edibles,xanax,cough syrup, and much more. Of course I will have a off the prescription menu of listing to choose from things like MDMA,Nbomes,Acid,Meth, Cocaine,Magic mushrooms. I am no honor so I do not judge a customer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why are you to be called &#039;&#039;The Nurse&#039;&#039; I just want to buy drugs no time for cute names.<br /><br /><br />That is a very good question, I am to be called &#039;&#039;The Nurse&#039;&#039; because not only will I make sure you get very clean quality medicine &amp; products, but I handle my customers with love and care. And Just as a real life nurse would do I am always willing to give advice or talk to a customer who is feeling a bit gloomy. I am of course willing to talk anything about the products I sell,to really any question a customer has on his/her mind even if it is a bit personal. I treat my customers with respect,love,and of course confidentiality. With me you can talk to about just anything and I will almost always be available on TORCHAT, or TORMAIL.&nbsp; I am trying to create a unique heart to heart experience with my customers here, I am very much so trying to stand out in the vendor category.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is your interest in talking to customers and all that mumbo jumbo?<br /><br /><br />Customers are never questioned or forced to tell me or ask me anything they do not wish to. I just offer that as part of customer services because I truly do not think of money as the first priority I actually value my customers thoughts and love towards me. If you ever are talking to me in a personal matter I suggest keeping real names or location to yourself for both of our safety. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When will you be up and running?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I plan to be up and running with a vendor account on Atlantis by 7/26/2013, and hopefully up and running on SR around that time as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anything else?<br />Yes be on the look out for my two official threads coming out, one will be a review thread and the other will be a sample thread! Yes that is correct once I am up and running on Atlantis I will be choosing TEN samplers to ship out samples of my product 100% for a honest review and feedback!<br /><br /><br /><br />If their are any investors or people interested in doing some kind of partnership deals I am very open to that but with all in due time of course. I have high hopes for this vending operation this will be my first time vending but I have been along side of A.O.D (AmericaOnDrugs) for quiet a while as his secretary so I have learned a thing or two you can say and everything should be smooth sailing. Really I just want to satisfy each and every customer world wide and maybe make a nice living out of it in the long run. If the customers are happy, I am happy, my purse is happy and pretty much everything is chilling&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; If anyone has questions or anything at all please feel free to PM me, or torchat me @ 2ckbpvbqhc6w32hv&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Yes this is &#039;&#039;TheAnonPrincessNikki&#039;&#039; I will still be A.O.D&#039;s secretary I stay true to my baby but this will be my main focus.

We all have to start somewhere right? Anyhow I will be moving to SR of course once the time is right. I am taking my patience and learning everything I can from A.O.D I am currently the secretary/personal assistant for a vendor who has &#039;&#039;ranked in the top 22% of sellers with 90.3% positive feedback from 293 transactions<br />has 271 fans .&#039;&#039; So I am in no way coming out of the blue in fact been working my way up the ladder slowly.&nbsp; To the user that said if this is a set up lol it is not I am just being very patient with this because I want to make sure before I get the operation started I have all the funds,supplies,and high quality tested products I need to have to keep a good reputation and the customers/friends happy. <br /><br />So I&#039;m sorry if you saw it as disrespectful to SR but that wasn&#039;t at all my intentions or to free advertise my Atlantis account, when I haven&#039;t even started my Atlantis vendor account yet? Don&#039;t see how that&#039;s free advertising but either way there is a big chance the second I start my vendor account on Atlantis I will start my SR one as well.

				DPR himself has stated that it is incredibly disrespectful to use SR and SR forums in order to direct buyers to your Atlantis account - regardless of whether that account exists already or is soon to exist.
