				On these forums i have read accounts of people in the UK who claim a package with drugs was found at customs and the police just showed up at the house with a search warrant, this worries me as i have housemates who would likely be in possession of drugs and if the house was searched due to my package being intercepted could potentially get in trouble. I&#039;m wondering if anybody knows any information about this that is a bit more concrete because the posts i read weren&#039;t particularly clear on the details and perhaps this only applies to international orders or only for larger amounts of drugs.

				Not too sure to be honest mate, are you on about just orders coming in from overseas? In my opinion pay a little bit more and stick to domestic ;)

				Unfortunately, in the UK the police only need reasonable grounds to suspect that drugs can be found at your address, rather than concrete evidence (you accepting a controlled delivery). The police need to convince the magistrate giving out search warrants that the drugs shipment they intercepted constitutes reasonable grounds to suspect more drugs will be found at the address.

				If the package is found yes they will come to your house this is reasonable i guess on there account but on the other hand tbh mate the uk border for controlling illigal substances along with weapons etc is pretty shit you have to think of how many parcels come to England on a day to day basis my advice is yh if you are ordering from here you are still taking a risk its like the saying dont do the crime if your not willing to do the time just think of the worse case scinario ie they come to your house so what should you do? well make sure they find no evidence atall then they cannot convict you evan if your names on the package.

				Thats fair enough, to be fair I&#039;ve not heard a lot of UK &gt; UK orders being intercepted, but i guess there is always that small chance. Guess, I&#039;m just a paranoid person, but i always dispose of any evidence straight away.

				Hi,<br /><br />Technically speaking the police don&#039;t even need a warrant to search the address….<br /><br />If they intercept a package with your name and address on, that is technically have grounds to arrest that person and they can search the place you arrested at under section 32 of PACE, which means they could knock your address, if you answer they could arrest you on the spot and then search the home.<br /><br />If they arrest you say at the postoffice collecting the package they can arrest you and get permission from an inspector for a search of your home under section 18, 15 or 15a of PACE.<br /><br />They are likely to get a warrant tho… because it allows a search of a property with out the occupants even need to be there, they can force entry and they don&#039;t need to arrest anybody so no grounds for arrest needed…. i.e. if provided a fake name not he package.<br /><br />The will carry out a &#039;controlled&#039; delivery which would usually involve an officer posing as policeman and ask you to sign for it…..<br /><br />Some simple steps can be followed to keep safe….<br /><br />Don&#039;t keep any product at home.<br />If you can use a different delivery address<br />If not then at least use a fake name….<br />Never EVER sign for a package or collect for the PO etc….<br />and to be extra safe… when you get the package write &#039;please return to sender&#039; on the envelope and leave it unopened for a minimum of 48hrs…. that way if you get raided you can claim it wasn&#039;t yours and you were planning on taking to the PO when you got chance on…. whatever day.<br /><br />Allow 48hrs because the police can take a while to get warrants from Mags depending on the time day discovered etc… they can get an emergency warrant out of court hours but this is extremely unlikely on small packages in the post. <br /><br />Stay Safe<br /><br />SpaceWhite :)

				The police in the UK need to prove beyond &#039;All Reasonable Doubt&#039; in order to prove the criminal offense in court.<br /><br />So you need a &#039;defense&#039; that will cast reasonable doubt over the case..... the most full proof defense would be anybody could of posted it, they obviously got the wrong address because officer it didn&#039;t even have my name on the envelope.... I didn&#039;t know what was inside and I planning of visiting the PO to return to send later in the week hence why it was left unopen on the side... that&#039;s not beyond reasonable doubt.<br /><br />The police are very much aware of SR because of the press coverage etc.... so they will look to disprove this &#039;defense&#039;... they will do this by seizing anything relating to drug use... they might swab places in the home to prove the said product has been in the house before (they getting readings on strength with these)<br /><br />They will without any doubt seize your phone and any computers.... they will then search these over an amount of time looking for anything that will link to SR.<br /><br />If they stumble across a product in the post then they are unlikely to let this out there sight until a controlled delivery is done which takes time to arrange... so although RM can be slow at times I would be suspicious of packages that take longer than usual in the post and take extra precautions like I listed above.<br /><br />Never mention anything about SR or deliveries you are expecting on the phone by text message.<br /><br />The computer is a little more difficult because it could be a family one etc and where would you store it if not at home.... but if you have a &#039;spare&#039; or &#039;old&#039; laptop etc I suggest you find an extremely good hiding place in the home you can hide it away whilst waiting on a delivery (they are unlikely to tear the house apart for a small package)... then keep a clean laptop etc on display in the house they can search until the cows come home.<br /><br />I&#039;d also suggest NOT transferring bitcoin to SR directly from MTGOX or similar... I&#039;d send it to a different account like bookchain etc.... its unlikely they would pursue all track with international countries for a small package.<br /><br />Sorry if it sounds like I&#039;m teaching to suck eggs but I have a fair amount of knowledge around this bit.... the advice is mainly for buyers... vendors have other risks they need to accept.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />WhiteSpace&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve spent £1000s over last 5 years on drugs both domestic &amp; abroad, and never had any trouble. Only 2 LL from customs for cigarettes saying i need to pay tax if i want them.<br /><br />I also know people who&#039;ve had orders of 100g of ket from pk opened and searched, then sent on, and there was never any kind of followup from that. Quite a bit is luck, and i reckon things will be rapidly changing what with all the exposure and media coverage.. So much better to be safer than sorry. <br /><br />If its small orders (anything under an ounce of weed etc) then i dont think you have anything to worry about, especially if its sent domestic. Large amounts of class As for resale though, much more likely to take action if discovered so be as careful as possible :)

				If you are shipping Domestic UK, there is an extremely low chance of this happening. The RM have been classed as one of the best mail services in the world, and currently they would not compromise that to better search for drugs in the post. Unless you are receiving large bulk orders, you are highly unlikely to get raided from a package of drugs. (However you may be unlucky enough to have your package siezed).<br />~D

				Yeah totally agree.... Bulk of class A are the only likely times you&#039;ll have any contact with the police and even then you be very unlucky to be discovered if the stealth is at decent standard.<br /><br />A vendor on the other hand needs to consider a few things, with all the press attention and negative news around SR by the media I don&#039;t think it will be long before the police in the UK actively seek to make an example of a vendor to show the press they are not ignoring it.

				Domestic is far safer. If you have smaller amounts sent its safer.. An envelope of powder instead of a big package. An item drug sniffer dogs are not usually trained to detect. A fake name, no sign for delivery... Hmmm these are all just things I think make it safer.

				Stay domestic UK to UK. No custom checks.<br /><br />DON&#039;T USE FAKE NAME - the RM know who live where and may hold packages that are not addressed properly.<br /><br />Most vendors don&#039;t even keep your details, once your order has been sent. Use your correct details, sometimes simplest is best. <br /><br />Only delivery problems I have ever had were when the details on the label, that i provided , were wrong.<br />Everyones got an alternative address they can get mail sent , that has genuine details . Use your imaginations......<br /><br />Do your homework , use a good vendor with good feedback. Avoid new vendors until relationships are built (PM them , chat with them,) good vendors will want to talk, ask the forum&nbsp; ( as you are doing. ) All good places to find who is good or not. <br /><br />SIMPLES

I&#039;m wondering if anybody knows any information about this that is a bit more concrete because the posts i read weren&#039;t particularly clear on the details and perhaps this only applies to international orders or only for larger amounts of drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Try not having drugs sent to your place? Where I live you can rent a place for 80usd a week its not a nice place but its just for drugs, you might wanna look up cheap living in your area. See what you can get away with.
