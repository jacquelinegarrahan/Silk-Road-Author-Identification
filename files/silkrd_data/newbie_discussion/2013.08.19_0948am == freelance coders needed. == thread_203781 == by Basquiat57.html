				Good programmers needed. Can&#039;t go into detail on the project at hand, but any assistance will be rewarded with 45BTC which is more or less $5000.<br /><br />Reply ASAP

				I might be able to help but it will help me and many others to know what sort of platform you are targeting i.e. desktop programming, web programming, stuff related to encryption and a basic overview or an overview of what sort of stuff need doing without going too far into specifics if privacy is an issue.

				Web programming and encryption specifically. This is a big project with a lot of money invested into it, therefore I cannot reveal to much to anyone unless I&#039;m positive they&#039;re on board. We have 6 guys working on it already, but we&#039;re falling behind schedule a little so we want at least 2 additional guys to assist us. Like I said, web programming and encryption. Extensive knowledge on networking would be necessary.

				I&#039;d be interested in learning more... 12+ year software veteran, much of that doing web services, security, etc. I&#039;ve often wondered how one goes about finding trustworthy people when everyone is anonymous, so I&#039;m also interested to see how you&#039;ve managed that. :)

I guess you could say I&#039;m good at spotting good character. Besides, all the guys I&#039;ve recruited for the project can&#039;t really do too much to harm it. I make sure that all the nitty gritty aspects of it are under my sole command. How about you message me your inquiries and we&#039;ll take it from there.
