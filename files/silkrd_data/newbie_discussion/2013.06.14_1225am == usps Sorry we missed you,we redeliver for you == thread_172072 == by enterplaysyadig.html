				If it&#039;s a 100 gram order of mdma I would be worried. They bust people with those big Canadian mdma packages all of the time. In fact, as far as I can tell, incoming mdma packages from Canada have been the only packages that people have been arrested off of with CD&#039;s.<br /><br />If it&#039;s just a small amount I wouldn&#039;t worry, they would have just confiscated it.

The USPS cannot legally hold contraband in their post office for you to get busted. They do controlled deliveries for that. It&#039;s all clear guy&nbsp; ;D In retrospect I would never order from a vendor that requires Signature&nbsp; upon delivery, Makes me too confused on whether I am getting a CD or not.

				Lol, you must be paranoid. They just don&#039;t want to leave it there and have it stolen (it&#039;s probably too big to fit in your mailbox, or you live in an apartment?). Or the sender asked for a signature.<br /><br />Either way, sounds normal to me.

				You won&#039;t go to jail. If they are gonna bust you for something they&#039;re gonna do it at your house and break your door down. I&#039;ve ordered many packages from Canada where they were too lazy to deliver it and I had to go the post office and pick it up....

				I get tons of mail every week and lots of these for stuff that won&#039;t fit in my mailbox or if I have to sign for it...Delivery Confirmation, so the seller knows you got it and signed for it.&nbsp; Seems totally normal.&nbsp;

				I have had to do this before with 14g pack of MDMA. This is what normally happens when you aren&#039;t home. Did it for sure require a signature?<br /><br />I sent someone else to get mine :D
