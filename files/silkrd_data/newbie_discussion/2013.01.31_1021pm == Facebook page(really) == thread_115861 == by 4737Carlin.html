				So I get the whole idea of growing the&nbsp; SR economy, but making a facebook page is that really the smartest idea :-\,and I don&#039;t mean because of the press it&#039;s getting,there&#039;s enough SR gossip and stuff to keep people chomping the bit for year&#039;s but when a site like SR tell&#039;s pretty much any dickhead with a PC how to get here how to use encryption the whole thing,and act all shocked and suprised there&#039;s so many fucking idiot&#039;s using SR imho 70% shouldn&#039;t even be here and need to get back in school and stop trying to play ganster it&#039;s not cool or clever,you might think that im a total prick,that&#039;s your right to free thought and speech,well done,but does SR really need a FB page,we keep being told to be annonymous yet there&#039;s a how to guide of SR on the world&#039;s biggest CIA surveilance network.<br />No offence to whoever made the page i&#039;m only a newbie but it seem&#039;s kind of illogical to me. ???<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; 8)<br />

				There is no problem with SR being public knowledge. It is. It&#039;s wide open. <br /><br />The problem with a facebook (or other social networks that require a valid user profile) is that connecting with SR, even at a &quot;fan&quot; level is basically an admission of patronage. You risk your anonymity. <br /><br />Play safe, <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.

				I personally feel its a doubled edged sword..its good and also bad. the only saving grace is well you have to be pretty dedicated to be on here and use it, lotta hoops, programs, downloads and reading to understand how it works. Most people are lazy tho, so that inturn balances it out.<br /><br />but yes facebook, take it down id say

				We&#039;ll always have attention whore&#039;s who love watching a page they create get a lot of attention. That&#039;s all this is. I think a nice neutral email complaint to FB&#039;s corporate office about it will have it taken down in no time due to controversy.

				I found out about SR from headline news!! i spose it didn&#039;t have instructions of how to do get here or even what the site was called. It did give me enough info to research and get here still.<br /><br />I like others in here think that SR on FB is a bad idea. And will most likely attract unwanted attention to the road!! I haven&#039;t seen the FB page and will keeping my distance.<br /><br />I&#039;m all about the anonymity and FB is quite literally the complete oposite of anonymous!!

				Not worried about the page, though I&#039;d never trust it. I know too many people who&#039;ve had their FB hacked, so even if all the info on it NOW is legit, someone might hack it and add phishing links. Or it might be bait to catch stupid people.<br /><br />I am worried about dumb people getting on SR and ruining it with unrealistic expectations and &#039;crying wolf&#039; all the time. I think the bond/rating system will likely keep scammers to a lowish level, but buyers can just keep creating new accounts...<br /><br />On a side note, IMO the weakest link ATM is getting product from A to B. Wondering about the practicalities of setting up an underground-railroad, a dark courier service... or maybe one already exists... can already think of a couple of dozen problems though...<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\ :-\ :-\

				The media is to blame. They made SR national news. Which is so idiotic in my opinion cause they just help advertize it by airing it for millions to see. They know LE can&#039;t do jack shit about it so what&#039;s the point in broadcasting it? Do a search on YouTube and you&#039;ll see how many different channels put SR on the news already. One of them even interviewed Dread Pirate Robert (and I believe DPR agreed to do this solely for the purpose of attracting more buyers - smart man!).<br /><br />The internet will never be the same again. Maybe the rate of street violence will go down drastically as well. You never know, this might be a good thing. <br /><br />Also keep this in mind: More buyers = more sellers = more seller competition = better deals.

				I completely agree with you OP, Facebook is Fedbook ! <br /><br />I heard about SR&nbsp; a long, LONG time ago from a friend by word a mouth who had actually ordered something. I never took the time to figure out about getting into it, but when I did, all I had to do was get the link from a video on YouTube(which explains step-by-step how to get here!) . <br /><br />All it takes is a smart officer/detective or somebody who is hired who knows what they are doing to get onto the site, as far as busting people I don&#039;t know but I was also worried about this !&nbsp; :-X
