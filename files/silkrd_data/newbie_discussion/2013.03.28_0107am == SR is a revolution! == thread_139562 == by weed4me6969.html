				Thank you so much DPR and staff.&nbsp; you have all made my life a heck of a lot easier, not to mention SAFER.&nbsp; I cant count the times that i have been put into a dangerous situation because of seeking drugs on the street.&nbsp; This is definitely a legitimate community that has a legitimate system.&nbsp; When people think of a black market, they think they are ran by dirty, scandalous, horrible people.&nbsp; It is exactly the opposite, these are extremely intelligent people that run this site, with extremely intelligent vendors (excluding a few).&nbsp; I am so proud of the people that have made this possible and hope they can continue to upkeep this site flawlessly. This is not the black market, but the white market! :D<br /><br />And what human being has the right to tell another human being that he cannot use certain plants and substances.&nbsp; you know what i call that, evil.

				I agree, the SR culture is inviting and interesting. I&#039;m proud to be part of SR and to be a vendor.

				Agreed,<br /><br />We must also consider the role SR has played in promoting the world&#039;s largest decentralized peer-to-peer electronic currency.<br /><br />So above any beyond what the anonymous marketplace has done for the freedom and safety in narcotic usage, it&#039;s also set a precedent for the future of &#039;money&#039;.<br /><br />One day when all of the world&#039;s independent fiat currencies are made obsolete the history books will look back at BitCoins and say &quot;This is where is all started!&quot; and ironically the demand for an anonymous currency was driven by the prohibition of illicit drugs!<br /><br />Thank you SR and everyone involved!<br /><br />
