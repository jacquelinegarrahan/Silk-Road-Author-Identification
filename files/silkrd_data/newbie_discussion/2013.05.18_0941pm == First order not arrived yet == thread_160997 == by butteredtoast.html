				My first order took (way) more than a month to arrive... It wasn&#039;t being shipped from a neighboring country but still. I think it&#039;s not a big deal if it&#039;s a day late, unless you FE&#039;d, in which case you may just be getting scammed!<br />I hope you get you LSD and have a good time! You&#039;ll try much more things than weed during your time here on SR :)

				Thank you.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what else I&#039;d be interested in besides LSD.<br /><br />I have a bit of cash in my account still, was thinking of order more L if I enjoy it. :)<br /><br />Just don&#039;t want to overdo it if i DO end up enjoying it.. maybe once a month at the most.<br /><br />I have a full time job and responsibilities so it&#039;s hard for me to find free time aside from my beloved Saturday.

				i don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about. i know waiting sucks! everyone goes through it. remember, canada is huge country in terms of land mass. if you ordered snail mail it can take some time to get to your destination depending on where it came from within canada to reach you.<br />the moment it arrives you completely forget about the waiting stress!

				I did not FE!<br /><br />I read that you should NEVER FE even if you are a first time buyer, so I went by that rule.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />I did a few months of research before signing up and purchasing.

				i think you have to have a certain number of posts before you can give a +<br />i&#039;m assuming a + means someone liked something you said<br />does - mean someone disliked something you said?<br />are people with a lot of -&#039;s pricks or something?

				To kive a karma you have to have 100 posts. When people say +1, it means they just gave you some positive karma, unless they have under 100 posts, in which case it means they would give you karma if they could.<br />Negative karma means someone didn&#039;t like what you said or you were being a dick/trolling/etc. Not everyone with a lot of bad karma is a dick though.

				This is a scam site. Nobody has ever had an order turn up. Ever. Sorry to say it but you&#039;ve lost your money mate.<br /><br />Haha only kidding. Good to see you&#039;ve done all your research first. It took me about two months before I felt ready to make my first order too. Makes me wonder how many newbies must do one if they get burnt on their first order thinking the whole site is blag?<br /><br />Hope your order turns up. After you&#039;ve tried LSD you might like to try MDMA. Non addictive just a pure loved up happy buzz!

Might try using a different address though. I still feel much more comfortable ordering here, rather than going to people I know in real life and getting 25i sold to me as acid.<br /><br />I read on the canada mail website that it can take up to 10 days to reach the US, so I think I still have some time. I just want it already!<br /><br />

				You&#039;re being&nbsp; inpatient. You ordered from Canada, I think we all have a pretty good guess who you ordered from. Your stuff will arrive very very soon if it hasn&#039;t already. And make sure you check every envelope that came to you, LSD guys are very good on the packaging stealth. Send your seller a message on what to look out for, a lot of people have had their stuff sitting on a pile of mail without noticing for days before realizing.&nbsp; I&#039;d start worrying after the 8th business day or so.<br />
