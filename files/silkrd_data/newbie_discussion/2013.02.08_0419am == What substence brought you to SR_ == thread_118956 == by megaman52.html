Sadly not the same for us here.

				prescription Pain relief. They are kicking chronic pain patients off opiates and the pain clinics (suboxone, other) have year long waiting lists...and here you have ta be an iv gram a day heroin user, or some crazy amounts to get in programs n e way..so THX SR for giving me quality of life and productivity. I am a great grower and still have a decent stash from my last gig-with SR help , i should be able to get that happening again. I also tried M for the first time in 20 years or so I hope to try ibogaine and ketamine maybe too. Or Dmt.

				I came to SR for the simple fact that where I am from everything is a lot more exspensive and you don&#039;t really know what you are getting in return.<br /><br />Started with LSD but now has grown into many things that I just enjoy getting over anything from the street.<br /><br />-bbw

				I came here for MDMA and Acid primarily, but also to explore other options. I had seen Silkroad for awhile, but got overwhelmed and never got around to sitting down and actually making anything of it. After waiting three hours for a guy to sell me something (he kept saying he was almost home) only to have him stop answering, I finally decided &quot;fuck it. I&#039;m done with dealers like this.&quot; and here I am. It is SUCH a great change. I got ripped off so many times and was overcharged so many times due to not having many connections or very much knowledge. This place is like my dream, seeing reviews of the actual product? And SO much cheaper than the BS I was paying before.
