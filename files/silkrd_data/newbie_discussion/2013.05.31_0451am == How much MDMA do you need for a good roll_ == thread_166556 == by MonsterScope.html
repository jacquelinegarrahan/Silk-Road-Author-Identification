				So i&#039;ve tried MDMA on 4 occasions now. The first time with a bunch of my friends, MDMA was in powder form, and they all snorted it. They got me to try it and i snorted 100mg didn&#039;t hit me very hard i then did 100mg again and it hit me a little harder but not to much. Second time Same friends same MDMA but i snorted 200mg of it i felt it hit me a lot harder than before but it didn&#039;t last long. I then decided to parachute 100mg of it and i felt nothing because i dont enjoy snorting it at all. Third time i ordered it here from SR and i parachuted 300mg on an empty stomach and it hit me hard they way i felt like it should. I know they say not to do that much but without that much i barely feel it and don&#039;t enjoy it that much. Fourth time i still had a little bit left over like .3 and was with 2 other friends. We all decided to snort .1 and it was the same stuff that hit me hard, but i once again felt little effects of it. Im just wondering if snorting it is not my thing and wondering how much you guys do and how do you do it. Any other tips or advice would be greatly appreciated thanks.

				Sounds like the MDMA you got with friends was stomped on a bit. Get some on the Road that is really pure because it generally only takes 70-100 mgs for a badass roll. <br /><br />I believe 200mgs can be very dangerous if you are not a regular user.<br />

				I don&#039;t roll much and I can get effects as low as 50mg off of SR stuff. However, if I want to get the full experience I take 140mg, then 80mg two or so hours in, or just when I feel like I&#039;m coming off my peak. If I take another 80mg+ after that second dose, about the 250mg+ range for a whole night, I start getting the eye twitching and it feel like my vision shifts in frames. That&#039;s about my limit, so I usually don&#039;t get to that point. I&#039;m about 180lbs as well, and I take L-Tryptophan as a daily vitamin for its non mdma related benefits.

				Maybe I just have high tolerance, but I was gonna say: initial dosee 100-200, depending on how hard you want to blast-off. Never more than 300mg at once, unless it&#039;s the third and final dose of the session. I don&#039;t like to dose more than 3 times, but feel it&#039;s always necessary to elevate the dose substantially between doses to get any real affect comparable to those earlier in the duration of the session. But, beware... the higher you dose the harder the come-down.

				That sounds disgustingly impure. Are you sure you arnt being sold methylone or smiler imitations? And if i may, who&nbsp; supplied this MDMA on SR because i get a feeling they are the kind of vendor i wanna avoid. Are you using an accurate and properly calibrated milli-scale cause just eye balling it is dangerous and dumb. Invest in your health and security if you arnt using a good scale.

				MDMA is one of those sorts of drugs that really affects people differently. Age, gender, drug usage history, height and weight all come into play.<br />That being said, for a new users, the &#039;average&#039; need for a good buzz out in the town would probably be around 110ish mg if it&#039;s decent stuff.<br />:)<br /><br /><br /><br />-BB

				I had not rolled in like 5 years and about 8 months back I got some moon rocks.. had to crush them down. I took 100mg started to feel it a little after about 45 min.. took another 100mg and BAM holy SHIT I was rolling so hard, I was at an epic festival too.. listening to prodigy live.. I felt like I was sky diving in to waterfall... everything was rushing through me so hard... even thinking about it now makes me tingle all over and feel euphoric a little (i read up about this, the memory association will bring back feelings)<br />best roll ever! it was easily the greatest time of my life.<br /><br />so since then I have had it 3 more times.. once 1 month on... ended up taking 500mg that night and it was ok but nothing compared to the first time... the next time same again.. ok but not really rolling much.. the last time I took 500mg as well spaced out over 4 lots of like 114mg.. and barely anything.. good feelings but I cannot live out that first time again. im so pissed!!<br /><br />I read somewhere that years and years worth of serotonin banked up will cause an incredible roll... but DAMNIT i cannot wait that long..<br />its been 6 weeks since my last time and Im going to give it 3 months and make sure I have the best gear.. im hoping so hard It can live up to the first time.

				yeah around 150-200mg for me. also, make sure you are already up before you snort it - snorting it is crap unless you are already mid roll IME, just stings

				in my country pills are terrible and ive got no access (except on here) to mdma, but if i bought a pill of a dealer somewhere id be happy if there was 100mg in it, but expecting around 50 or so.&nbsp; i think perfect for me is around 150-180 though.&nbsp; <br />Not balls to the wall, but something is gonna be on the wall

Whatever he was taking clearly was very low percentage of MDMA. i cant imagine what he just put inside himself but it wasent good. Will await OP response to my previous questions to shed some more light on it, maybe they are 350+ lbs and have good reason to show dramatically diminished results/mg. Or they are on the path of death repeatedly ingesting poison. Test your shit guys, there is a reason sketchy people are involved in drugs, especially when you get anonymous with who is supplying it. Be Safe

				1. Bombing is better than snorting it - bombing it allows it to metabolise fully<br />2. 120mg is the average dose to be &quot;rolling&quot; - a top of 80mg 2 hours in then gets you fully &quot;rolling&quot; again.<br />3. Doing more than about 200mg in one session - although it is something I have done a hundred time myself is pointless - all that happens is that the physical effects increase (such as the jaw clenching, rolling eyeballs etc.) - you never get the same euphoric effects again.<br /><br />p.s. been doing this shit since 1989.<br /><br />If you really like the feeling of &quot;rolling&quot; where you can&#039;t get the words out and the eyes as jigging around and you keep sighing and yawning and losing your legs when you dance, then by all means drop 200-250mg in one go.<br /><br />One word of warning - do not try and do a whole 0.4 g crystal in one go - if it is real mdma that you have taken you will:<br />a) find yourself lying on the floor<br />b) be happy as fuck but fucked asy fuck<br />c) complain that your body is cramping<br />d) confuse the hell out of everyone by going on about a cramp in the roof of your mouth<br />e) spend a good while throwing up on every wave whilst smiling and gurning and trying to tell everyone your fine and having a great time<br />f) not mind the fact that you have sick all over your hair and clothes<br />g) maybe be forced to take a shower by friends<br />h) not remember being naked on the bathroom floor after the shower with your friends trying to get you to put a towel round you<br />i) shunning the towel in favour of the sheer beauty of the bathroom floor<br /><br /><br />I should also state that the incidents above can also happen on smaller doses (180mg) to people who have very little tolerance.<br /><br />peace.<br />I have gone through numerous spells

				My only experience with MDMA was catastrophic. I ingested around 130mg and started to come up rapidly. Then I started to feel really bad, I had diarrhea, my heart was racing and I was sweating profusely. I also had bad vertigo, so I was just laying in bed for hours and hours until I got better. Other people who took the same product in lower doses felt fantastic and had the whole MDMA experience as it should be....Bad luck I guess..

				My tolerance for mdma has been getting crazy lately.&nbsp; I need at least 180mg + 150mg of methylone to get started.&nbsp; Have you guys tried MDA + M1?&nbsp; Fucking great!&nbsp; Even better than MDMA + METH.&nbsp; I guess because MDA releases more dopamine than mdma and M1 works on that receptor as well so you get this euphoric bell ringer that lasts for a long time.&nbsp; You guys should try it!
