				i think a standard has to be set where DPR and his crew allow us (the buyers) to report sellers who demand FE on purchases not only is it unfair it kind of goes against what this sites all about, there&#039;s no &quot;trading standards&quot; in FE and its becoming more and more rife especially on big orders and its so easy done falling into a false sense of security with being a regular buyer with a seller you build what seems like a &quot;relationship&quot; with them and then boom next thing you&#039;ve been fucked over.<br /><br />Anyways it would be nice to see some action being taken on this matter, not that i think my post in the newbie section will make a blind bit difference but surely if we all let it be heard something would eventually be done about it :)<br /><br />PS avoid seller named CHIQUITA known selective scammer.

				There&#039;s no way for SR to FORCE vendors not to ask for people to FE.&nbsp; All SR can do is advise over and over again that people ALWAYS STAY IN ESCROW and DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY.&nbsp; SR has made that position abundantly clear, but it can&#039;t eradicate FE&#039;ing, I don&#039;t think.&nbsp; All it can do is discourage finalizing early - which they / we do already.&nbsp; If a buyer or vendor choose to ignore that, then they do so at their own peril.&nbsp; The escrow system is in place for the protection of both the vendor and the buyer - there is no reason to choose to leave escrow or go around it.

				The idea of FEing for any reason is ridiculous. This whole system relies on escrow and these are drugs we&#039;re talking about. I will never FE but if vendors want to do it, I don&#039;t see why they showed be forced to not ask for it. It is really on us buyers to make sure we don&#039;t ever FE. That said, it would be nice to have some kind of an icon or red font for the listings that are asking for FE so that we don&#039;t waste our time.
