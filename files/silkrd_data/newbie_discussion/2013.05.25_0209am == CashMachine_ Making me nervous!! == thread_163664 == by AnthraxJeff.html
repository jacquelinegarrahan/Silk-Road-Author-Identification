				Just been doing some reading in the forums about scammers and stuff, and also I&#039;ve got 100g of pollen on order from CashMachine that I&#039;m still waiting for from 9 days after ordering with next day delivery! <br />I had one of the same delivered from him the week before and that got to me within 3 days so I was pretty hopeful of getting this one in the same kind of time, but comms between us broke down and he&#039;s not even reading my messages anymore.<br />He&#039;s got listings on his page for some real serious money, and I&#039;m just wondering If anyone has placed any big orders with him that theyve been waiting a long time for? Because judging from the feedback, one of the biggest orders that has actually been recieved by anyone, is my original 100g bar over 2 weeks ago, could he be about to earn money from scamming big orders to win on the resolution process? <br />Obviously I hope I&#039;m completely paranoid and my shit turns up tomorrow like it should but If anyones got a lot invested with him I&#039;d have a think and let others know on here maybe, Cheers! AJ

				I got a reply back from him today. So, so dissappointed and angry. <br /><br />He says he posted it to the wrong address, to some guy that ordered an ounce from him, but it&#039;s ok because he sent it back anyway.<br />&nbsp;Oh, good, that was lucky for you then eh Cashmachine? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been sitting here like a fucking chump with no weed to smoke, wondering if the police have got my shit and are prepping for a visit. Meanwhile your moaning about the fact you&#039;ve got too many fucking orders on and people are whinging about your processing times.<br /><br />If you didnt want people to expect quick delivery, you shouldnt have made the bold claim that &quot;all orders dispatched within 5 hours&quot;. Bullshit. Second order took the full 4 days just to get marked in transit.<br /><br />Ok, Ok, I know you were having technical difficulties and shit the week before, I messaged SR support for you, twice in fact.<br />&nbsp;But If your SilkRoad messages weren&#039;t working again, why didn&#039;t you mail me on Tor with the address I gave you on wednesday to inform me that you needed my address again to do a re-send? thus putting my mind at rest and letting me know that there were yet more ongoing problems with this fucking nightmare of a transaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;Add to this the fact that he wrongly sent my 1st order recorded, and it was sat in my neighbours house for about 6 hours before I knew anything about it, and youve got the makings of a professional. Fucking A-Class service.<br /><br />Maybe its just my luck, as is often the case; or maybe the guy is an idiot.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know, but I dont think I&#039;ll be ordering again from him in the near future, its going to take me some time to calm down from the fucking stress hes caused me over the last week.<br /><br />Be wary folks, his comms is very good when its good, but when its bad its fucking atrocious. If your going to order from him, I&#039;d seriously consider messaging him first to see how long a fucking delay you can expect. <br /><br />Good luck, AJ

				I&#039;m also really curious to know who the decent honest chap was who, upon recieving 100g instead of 28g, decided to inform CashMachine and actually send him the product back. If he&#039;s telling the truth about this one, fair play to the guy I say. <br /><br />I&#039;m still not sure what to think of CashMachine really. I doubt this is going to get much attention in the newbie section but would be good to hear someone elses experiences with him so far.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m completely new to any kind of forums, and I cant be arsed spamming to 50 at the mo. Is there any way someone could quote it so its seen by more people? Would be much appreciated, cheers, AJ<br />

				Waiting on an order from him too man, I know that feeling. I wouldn&#039;t be too arsed if he didn&#039;t boast 5 hour dispatch, been a few days now. Most of his feedback is 5/5 so he must be sending out some stuff but I think there&#039;s a lot of people waiting at the moment so he might be about to receive a shitstorm of bad feedback. <br /><br />At least he&#039;s taken the stuff about his customers&#039; feminine side of his vendor page, maybe he hasn&#039;t lost it after all. Maybe he really is overloaded due to cheap prices but he shouldn&#039;t do things he can&#039;t handle. Either way, hopefully we get what we wanted soon. I&#039;ve not been waiting as long as you.

				I&#039;m also waiting. Sent him 3 messages, including 1 on tormail, no reply to any of them. At least he&#039;s replying to you though Jeff, we know the guy is alive. <br /><br />I think the story about sending back a free 72g more than what he ordered is most likely untrue. Senders don&#039;t use real return addresses and I doubt he would message a buyer his address, that&#039;s a terrible move for a vendor to do. If anything, just put up a custom listing for the cash difference or somewhere in between.

				Good to know there are a few of us in the same boat, should help if it comes down to the resolution centre. <br /><br />The story about getting 4OZ instead of 1 has gotta be 100% bullshit but at least he&#039;s messaging someone. I asked him to cancel my order but all he&#039;s done is PMS on his vendor page and add scammy sounding listings like the master&#039;s degree and bitcoin sales.<br /><br />Those high prices aren&#039;t too strange, I&#039;ve seen plenty of vendors that list huge amounts but rarely sell them. He&#039;s only been active a few months and his rep isn&#039;t perfect so I doubt he&#039;s planning a tony76 scam.

				I got another message from him late tonight when I got home from work, he&#039;d sent in the afternoon I think.<br />&nbsp;<br />As I told him in the reply, starting the day WITHOUT getting angry at an empty postbox is far easier to take than the rage and paranoia of no comms.<br /><br />I&#039;m a hell of alot calmer today and more able to think about things rationally and having read his reply, he does sound genuine, he sounds like the guy I bought hte first bar off! lol&nbsp; <br />and it&#039;s a pretty good chance that he&#039;s just swamped at the minute I think now. Would be a pretty lame way of scamming people really unless there was more to it, not my subject really! <br />&nbsp;We had good comms to start with and todays message was really quite reassuring, sooo, I&#039;ve re-sent my address so he can post on tuesday. <br />Hope I ain&#039;t made a mistake but I dont want to feel so negative any more, looooong week of that behind me! It WILL turn up haha! With a freebie I&#039;ll wager!<br /><br />&nbsp;I talk about luck quite a lot, because the only luck I get seems to be bad. Wana know where I invested the other half of my total cash 6 days ago? Still waiting? MrCronk. Read his latest vendor update. FML

				I cancelled my order a few days ago as soon as I had the option due to all the recent news about him. This morning I got a message saying sorry for the delay, he will send it out tonight (a bank holiday, so the post offices are closed) or cancel the order for me if I still want to (I asked him to on Thursday I think, before the 4 day time limit). <br /><br />I&#039;m still not sure if he&#039;s trying to scam people or just really busy but at least he apologised for the delay and responded to a message. If his prices stay low and it turns out he&#039;s a legit seller with good recent feedback I might order from him again. Good luck Cashmachine and his customers.

				No reply from him again, I sent him a new address but the message is still marked as unread in my inbox. Regardless of that, if he&#039;s still having trouble with comms then he should just send me something on Tormail. I duno what the hells going on. <br /><br />Who&#039;s the guy who left feedback for him yesterday, and is updating it frequently? he&#039;s waiting for the same item as me; I&#039;m wondering if Cashmachine even has enough Pollen haha,,<br /><br />seriously tho i duno what the fucks happening , HES FRYING MY BRAIN

				He&#039;s had a serious drop in feedback over the last few days. That&#039;s a bonus for you if it goes to resolution. If you&#039;re really lucky you may be able to get a refund without it affecting your stats. Someone left him a 2/5 yesterday for 100g of pollen but didn&#039;t really say the reason. <br /><br />He might cancel the order if you ask him to, although he has supposedly sent it already if it&#039;s marked in transit. If he cancels then you know he&#039;s been keeping your address without posting your item which is highly against the SR rules for a vendor. Other feedback says he&#039;s been doing this, you can tell from the postage stamp when the order was actually posted. If this is true then maybe he&#039;ll get his account closed and you&#039;ll get a 100% refund without it affecting your stats. <br /><br />Hopefully he&#039;ll pull through or you can get out unscathed.<br /><br />The best advice for now (or ever) is don&#039;t FE. I managed to cancel on time and avoid a lot of this stress you&#039;re going through. Good luck man.

				I&#039;ve heard this pureogkush mentioned before I should do some reading inabit.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you look at all of CashMachines feedback, ( which he&#039;s been obsessed with from the start ), from what you can tell by the information visible about orders, he&#039;s not had any feedback confirming orders any bigger than mine, possible that some of them are for multiples, i.e someones ordered 5 x 1 grams of coke or something, that&#039;d be more but I&#039;m wondering if he&#039;s running out of stuff and is just planning to scam international orders with his FE policy?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />More peoples input needed I think before he starts ripping people off!!<br /><br /><br />Someone quote this out of the newbies thread or something? please?!

				Been in resolution with my order now for just over a day I think and still no comms at all from him.

				Fuck me this is beginning to feel like a job. I&#039;ve just found a message from him on Tormail, first time he&#039;s used it to contact me, it&#039;s from bout 8 hours ago.<br /><br />He says he can&#039;t access his SR account, won&#039;t let him onto the site, but has posted all outstanding orders. So I&#039;ve contacted SR Support for him again to see if they can help. <br /><br />This is growing tiresome.....

				Ah well, maybe I shouldn&#039;t have cancelled. His coke prices are the best so maybe he was just really swamped, lots of orders to process for cheap goods. Good to know he&#039;s not scammer even if he isn&#039;t the most reliable seller. Might order from him again if reports stay positive.

				<br />This joker is so on the scam that he just dropped his 66k F.E coke offer to 45 k , because he knows the end is nigh !<br /><br />He&#039;s so obvious it&#039;s ridiculous , btw he had 99 + feedback when I placed my order 2 weeks ago it now stands at 87 - even with all his fake 5 star shit<br /><br />Mark my words he will not last another week here and if you f.f you are going to get fucked by him&nbsp; 4 sure .<br /><br />I&#039;m posting this in every thread related to him so we can&nbsp; hopefully save some one a lot of money , he targets those of us looking for value , and those that get hit are often the ones who can&#039;t afford to lose it - he&#039;s scum aka pureogkush aka cashmachine and&nbsp; he will fuck you all day long .

				A buyer might contact a vendor about an overshipment (I have), but no vendor is stupid enough to allow a product to be returned. They might as well just turn themselves in at a police station.<br /><br />If he is able to ship a canceled order, he&#039;s saving addresses, and that makes him very dangerous to all of his customers.<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I just had ImportConnection try to scam me last week.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t ever FE anyway, but I knew that they were scamming because they marked my order in transit before they sent me a PM in which they offered me extra product if I would FE.&nbsp; So I knew that either they were marking unshipped items in transit, which is both dishonest and against SR policy, or they were running an outright FE scam.&nbsp; Anyway, my point is that seemingly small policy violations are usually indicators of larger problems.

				would that not be like committing suicide here requesting a product be sent back, giving away your home location aint a good move i would take the loss as a vendor, rather than give anything away.<br /><br />But then again not the brightest excuse i have seen from a vendor.&nbsp; ;D

				I got that message as well, pnKed, I didnt have any orders with him at the time though so must have been a bulk reply to his inbox. Good riddance to him, glad I didn&#039;t get ripped off by him in the end, condolences to anyone who did
