				Who is going to step up and be the next SourDieselMan, the hero that SR deserves? Does anyone else provide quarter pounds of AAA+ indoor marijuana for less than 800? Surely there is a hole in the market now. Who would you guys recommend using? I see a few other vendors but they are grossly overpriced...

				I&#039;m referring to his AAA+ indoor listing. He had 3 listings greenhouse, green house light deprivation, and indoor. Did you ever order? I&#039;m not saying he had the best quality on the road, far from it. But at under 800 a QP his indoor was definitely dank and worth it. No one else seems to offer that.

				I can do QPs for 800 including shipping. Don&#039;t have the massive stockpile of buds sdm had (I can only afford to pick up a lb or 2 at a time right now) but I will once things get rolling I hope! :)

				Ive used darkexpresso...not for indoor, but he does carry it. And his prices don&#039;t match up with what you need. I got the greenhouse mango strain...I&#039;ve noticed he&#039;s since risen his prices maybe since SDM departed. It was a good transaction...deff not indoor. But all good nugs. But for indoor he has listings for QP and HP for like 1100/2000. There isn&#039;t much meat left on the bones at these prices! He has greenhouse for like 1500 a HP. Good luck...I&#039;m looking as well.

				No prob. And for my 50th post I&#039;ll go into some more detail about my order ;-)<br /><br />Shipping was pretty stealth. Deff adequate! Had it in 3 days. <br />Price I paid was 28ish I believe for a LB. He has since risen that though...<br />Quality was a step above what I consider outdoor quality. It didn&#039;t look as rough as a lot of outdoor looks. Good fully formed nugs...zero shake or worthless buds. Smell wasn&#039;t overpowering. But it was nice. I got what I paid for and expected. <br /><br />Overall I was happy with my order...but I would like to find something a bit better. If a bulk vendor could set up with decent prices, they&#039;d get great biz. But since people are willing to pay more I guess I understand it...
