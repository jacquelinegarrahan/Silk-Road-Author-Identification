				Here&#039;s an interesting read - http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/03/29/1743201/Attacking-and-Defending-the-Tor-Network *Clearnet link*<br /><br />Here are some of the statements made on that page:<br /><br />If you&#039;re going through a proxy server to get to Tor, the proxy server knows your IP and everything you&#039;ve browsed. This defeats the purpose of using Tor.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I2P is for. No exit nodes, purely internal. It has a number of neat architectural differences from Tor to make it harder to attack and to improve performance. Also, for those who care, unlike Tor, I2P doesn&#039;t try to block filesharing.<br /><br />Downsides: I2P is Java, so it eats more CPU. Also, it has a smaller userbase, meaning it&#039;s been less studied and isn&#039;t as resistant to takeover-style attacks like Sybil. And, obviously, you don&#039;t route to the outside world from I2P.<br /><br />I guess that the research demonstrated by Stevens LeBlond just goes to prove what most of us have known for a long time - even using TOR (and the same will go for any other type of encryption, IP masking etc) you are not 100% safe if somebody wants to work out who you are. The governments may not care too much if you are just sharing a few pirated movies around, although some companies may. All that TOR does is provides people who aren&#039;t really that switched-on with a false sense of security about their activities.<br /><br />Recently discussed on Bruce Schneier&#039;s blog (&quot;Identifying Tor Users Through Insecure Applications&quot;):<br /><br />http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/03/identifying_tor.html *Clearnet link*<br /><br />###<br /><br />Do the people on these forums have any idea what in the hell they&#039;re talking about?<br /><br /><br />
