				Hi guys,<br /><br />unfortunately I cannot post this in the proper Tutorial-Thread...not yet...but I still hope someone can give me a hint.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just installed Tails on my USB drive and everything works like a charm, BESIDES the fact that my laptop won&#039;t power off automatically when I shutdown Tails.<br />It says &quot;please remove the USB flash drive and press ENTER to continue: [some number] Starting new kernel&quot; and I&#039;ve tried it either way...removing it and not removing it....both ways nothing happens.<br />I&#039;ve even formatted both USB sticks and started the whole thing again from scratch...with the same results.<br /><br />Am I an idiot (since this hasn&#039;t been mentioned in the Tutorial thread) or....?

				What happens when you click &quot;Shutdown Immediately&quot; and just let it go through its process?

				I think he is speakin&#039; about the shutdown process. I don&#039;t know about this bug, everything works well for me with tails.<br /><br />I can highly recommend it.

				I know that&#039;s what he&#039;s talking about, but I&#039;m wondering what happens.&nbsp; He says nothing happens ... does that mean the screen stays on something?&nbsp; Or does it go blank?&nbsp; What exactly happens?<br /><br />(I use Tails so I know what it&#039;s supposed to do - I&#039;m trying to determine what the OP is seeing.)

				I&#039;m sorry about my mistake.<br /><br />I guess the memory isn&#039;t able to wipe and because of this the system doesn&#039;t shut down.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />thanks for looking into my issue. JXXLSupport ist right, the problem I have is that Tails seems to have problems with the wiping. When I shut down it proceeds normally (with all those text-based things going) until it reaches the point where it says to remove the usb stick and press enter. Thats where its supposed to switch off the computer eventually after the wiping is finished. Which it doesn&#039;t...<br /><br />What I have to add is that i&#039;ve found out the whole thing works like a charm on my desktop computer...it switches off after a couple of seconds after the &quot;please remove your usb drive and press enter&quot; message (where i don&#039;t remove it because how can things be wiped off my usb stick then).<br />Its just my netbook that gets stuck in that particular moment...which is weird.<br /><br />Is there anything hardware-related which can freeze that process?

				&nbsp; Are you running tails in live or safe mode?

				I run it in Live, I guess. Well, not the Failsafe Option which i could choose after starting to boot Tails, if thats what u mean.<br />Interestingly enough i have managed to get it running &quot;more stable&quot; after I changed some settings about being able some USB Power settings in BIOS (ie being able to charge devices via USB even when the netbook is switched off). I have no idea if those two things really are related to each other but at the moment 7 or 8 out of 10 shutdowns are as I would expect them to be.<br />Still leaves the question why its not 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Thanks a lot for the feedback so far. I really appreciate it.....
