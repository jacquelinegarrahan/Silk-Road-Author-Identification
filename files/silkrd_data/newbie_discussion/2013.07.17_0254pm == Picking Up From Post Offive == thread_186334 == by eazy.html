				i have something sent from the netherlands to my city (AUS) and it has taken exactly the right amount of time to get here. the only problem is that the persons house i sent it to was not home to take the delivery. <br />he lives in units and his letterbox is out front with the rest, im guessing that the parcel was too big to be put in the letterbox and the postie was lazy and he was left a &quot;pick up from post office slip&quot;. would the package be being watched by LE if it arrived on time but taken to the post office or am i just being paranoid not to pick it up. there are another 2 packages on the way.

				If you&#039;re paranoid clear anything suspicious off your computer - anything TOR related - and anything illicit from your apartment - i.e. drugs etc.<br /><br />Go and collect your parcel with a clean conscience. If someone is sending you drugs and then telling the police about it to get you into trouble - that&#039;s not a crime. The police have to prove more than delivery - they have to prove intent. So, remember: YOU ARE INNOCENT.

				rocknessie, if the police really want to don&#039;t you think they could get a possesion verdict no hassles, intent to bring it in and so on a bit more difficult, drug courts don&#039;t seem to believe in reasonable doubt so much in Australia, good thing is you pretty much get a few strikes before you actually are looking at time here.

				Sounds fine to collect if it&#039;s under your real name. Otherwise you obviously can&#039;t without fake id which I would not do.

				I would suggest not picking it up.&nbsp; Unless it&#039;s a huge shipment or something.&nbsp; Going in and picking it up on camera and whatnot is never a grand idea.

				Lazy, Or not safe. They need authorization to leave safe (ATL) its kind of on his back if your neighbor picks it up.. you could hire a courier to collect it for you and deliver it whilst your home.&nbsp; Though this will have a proof of delivery, they won&#039;t ask for ID of whom the receiver is they will simply give it to anyone at the residence.

				We are decently lucky that the weights you can import without moving into the marketable or trafficking range are decent if you have a range of addresses to send to you can sort yourself no hassles, and even when you price adjust for the % gets taken it is still sound value most of the time.<br /><br />Also mate unless you have been sending a fair amount to this address I doubt there is a sting, investigations last a few months gathering the data to get as much of an idea of the operation and routines of the operations and try work out the network map you are working with before making a string, even if they are watching you can receive packages, and then if you can make them disappear they can&#039;t prove anything other then you signed for a package which contained controlled substances and generally you don&#039;t get hassled a whole lot for just that, they put it on the shelf for later and move on to their next piece.
