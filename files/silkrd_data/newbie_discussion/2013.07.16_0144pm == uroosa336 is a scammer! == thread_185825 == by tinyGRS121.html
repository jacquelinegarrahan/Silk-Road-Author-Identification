				They tried to get me to FE because the order was &#039;large&#039; even though it was under $200 and I have perfect stats ($1600 in 4 months, 0%, 0%)!<br /><br />BEWARE!

				He&#039;s in stealth mode now I believe. He asked many people to FE and then fled the scene. I don&#039;t think anyone has anything to worry about now, but I thought I&#039;d mention it just in case you were one to FE last week. He had 100% with 57 or so transactions. It&#039;s hard to trust anyone but just never ever ever FE under no circumstances!

				It amazes me how many people FE. What the fuck are they thinking? I know, I know...you want to trust people and give them the benefit of the doubt. But you just CANNOT do that here! NEVER EVER FE people!

				Just because a vendor asks you to fe doesn&#039;t automatically make them a scammer. If they do you have 2 options:1 be a dumbass and fe, or 2: move on to another vendor that doesn&#039;t require it. Either way, unless you know you&#039;ve been scammed, don&#039;t ruin the vendor&#039;s reputation solely based on him\her asking you to F.E.

				I&#039;m new here, and I too was scammed by uroosa336. I think there were about five or six of us who FE&#039;d early and felt safe due to his/her prior transactions with good feedback. It was the first time I had been scammed here. I REALLY needed the goods as I&#039;m sure we all did. Why he/she suddenly bailed is anyone&#039;s guess. I just wanted to post this in case it helps someone to know they are not alone. I still like it here. Live and learn... I guess.

				Add me to the list! I too was scammed by uroosa336 recently. I&#039;ve done quite a few buys on SR and this was my first FE. I had a large order and guess I wanted to trust him--dumb move. Live and learn and will NEVER FE again. <br /><br />

				Only time I ever had to FE and got scammed!&nbsp; Agreed to it because price was so good.&nbsp; Lesson learned.&nbsp; Tired of vendors saying anyone with less than 10 transactions or $500/ $1000 has to FE.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just deal with more trusting vendors (and maybe pay a little more).&nbsp; Besides, doing 10 transactions with FE doesn&#039;t prove anything anyway- the person hasn&#039;t earned any trust, they&#039;ve been forced to send the $$.<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone ever heard back or got their stuff from uroosa336?&nbsp; I ordered on 7/11 and I&#039;ve sent multiple messages- nada.

				Good advice, I&#039;ve seen a few vendors asking for FE&#039;s, but mostly for buyers with no or little stats.

				Slightly off note.... Along with scamming vendors you also have very down to earth and trusting vendors. I dont like bring this up as I feel some buyers would be inclined to take advantage of it, but on more than one occasion and with more than one vendor I have had my package shipped before I can pay for them as dealing with btc is always a lengthy process. I wont mention current vendors that have done this for me but past vendor Mitanox was a standup guy that did this for me a few times. Its pretty sad that everyone, both vendors and buyers, have to have their guard so high up. As great as this community is it would be so much more amazing if we didn&#039;t have people looking to make a quick buck.
