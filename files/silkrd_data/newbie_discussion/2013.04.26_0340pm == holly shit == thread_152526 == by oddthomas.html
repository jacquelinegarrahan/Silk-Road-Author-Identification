				general rule of thumb is always give yourself wiggle room, in case of fluctuations or if you&#039;re too lazy to calculate.

				Bitinstant? Never have had a problem with them, even when I had a problem with them, it wasn&#039;t a problem. I&#039;ve been doing bitinstant into MtGox, that way I feel like I&#039;m in control and fulfills any desires I have to be a broker.<br />But Fuck MtGox. <br />I understand they started facing stricter regulation. I also understand how ridiculous the bubble was and how much attention it brought to bitcoin and MtGox in particular. I don&#039;t think it would have bubbled that way if the trading was more distributed among the other markets. <br />Anyone have a favorite? BTC-e seems cool and simplistic enough, I know bitstamp is out there.<br />Hmm, maybe this is a question better left unanswered, I have some paranoia about coin going in and out of bad addresses and being linked to my now very real and now very verified account with mtgox.
