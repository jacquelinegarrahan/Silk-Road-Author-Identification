				So I&#039;m new to silk road, so far I had two good orders from the same vendor from UK, both arriving in around a week or so, never had to resolve, but after that it seems that all my orders are not arriving anymore, I&#039;m ordering from different vendors now and so far I have one order that hasn&#039;t arrived after like 30 days (but was sent from africa so I thought that was the problem), one order that I just sent to resolve and extended the due date by 14 days today (was 12 hours left to auto-finalize, also from africa, but different vendor), one order that has two days left before auto-finalize and one order that has 5 days left before auto-finalize (the last two are from other countries in europe)<br /><br />Now, I want to ask if it&#039;s normal that packages take so long to arrive or is something wrong? Maybe someone found one of my packages and is checking all the rest right now just to be sure it&#039;s not drugs too? Is that possible? The packages are all small ~0.5g-1g, only one was around 5g.<br /><br />Also probably worth mentioning that I live in europe, near Latvia (Won&#039;t say exactly which country, unless necessary)

				If packages are taking that long to arrive and the vendor is not responding to messages, I would advise to ask for full refund as soon as possible. My only resolution experience was on my first order. Vendor just disappeared. Everyone was posting reviews of never receiving, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I asked to extend 30 days... Still after that nothing. I was granted 100% refund and nothing against my stats. <br /><br />Hopefully you have a better experience, but that is my advice.
