				I always wondered if there was an online blackmarket after seeing commercials about people selling identities. But this was way beyond any of my dreams lol. Any one else agree?

				totally agree with you, i had heard people talk about SR but always thought it was too good to be true! That was until a good friend of mine ordered successfully but it wasnt until very recently that i decided to test it out for myself. still trying to wrap my head around PGP encryption though haha

I tried to use a program with a GUI on linux, but it was a pain, so I just figured out how to do it through command line; I&#039;m not sure if they have a command line version available for windows or osx, but I&#039;d recommend looking for a tutorial specific to whatever version you get. <br />Also, when you go through the tutorial, try to think about it conceptually, asking why you&#039;re doing each step (like importing the public key of the vendor, etc).<br />Hope you find something that helps!

				i too am surprised and i think its fantastic- seems like there&#039;s all kinds here- but yea definately install and start playing with pgp- its easy once you get the basics and there&#039;s tons of info and people who help!<br />wp

				i did watch a tutorial with an Aussie someone had posted on the sticky page at the top. Im running GPG4win, made my key, copied a vendors public key in txt doc and saved it imported it and then used clipboard to make a message and encrypted using their key...i think im getting the hang of it but havent had a reply yet...to me it seems like all you need is GPA (if your familiar with that) i dont see the need for kleopatra or the 4 other programs it installed! Still a newbie though..I find it fun to mess around with new programs. Up until three days ago I had no idea what Tor was or bitcoins! fascinating all of it!

				I&#039;m still getting the hang of the pgp thing too. Seems complicated until you get a good tutorial to explain. I&#039;m still amazed at the level of weed i can get. Seems like everything I had before was bullshit

				it is quite amazing how SR seems to operate- and it is revolutionary in alot of ways- from the cryptocurrency to the Tor to pgp. im just gratefull to have access to medical grade herbs- so much more healthy than drinking yourself to death

				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />so true, its so stupid the way government bodies promote drinking and bash smoking...although it seems like we are making headway (atleast here in the US) but alcohol is such a powerful drug! Its unfortunate that I&#039;m in the process of getting a job (recent graduate) and of course all the jobs I&#039;m going for require drug tests...my weed smoking will have to be postponed ! for a little. We all know the main substance they are testing for is MJ because it stays in your system so long. oh well (end rant) back to the point this website rocks! glad i joined

				If DPR were just another entrepreneur trying to make some money, SR would still be awesome.&nbsp; It&#039;s like getting a little tiny glimpse of what a truly free market would be like, and it has built-in barriers to entry for big greedy corporations, too!<br /><br />But the fact that the founder is an eloquent, idealistic and yet intensely practical anarcho-capitalist... that just pegs the awesometer to 11.
