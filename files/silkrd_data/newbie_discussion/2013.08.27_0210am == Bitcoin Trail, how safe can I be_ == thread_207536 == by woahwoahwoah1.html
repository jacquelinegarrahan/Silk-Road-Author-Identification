				Hi.<br /><br />I&#039;m in Australia and have been using SR lightly for nearly 8 months now. I&#039;ve been using the same site since I started to buy BTC though, spendbitcoins. Yesterday was my last straw with the site though, there BTC price was nearly $15 more then ANY other site, and they have the biggest fee of 10%. The only thing they have going for them was me knowing I was 100% anonymous when buying.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at another site for a while now. It has a 2% fee, and their BTC price is brilliant, the site is legit and delivers BTC faster. Of course though, they want my ID, and proof of address (a bill etc) sent to them in email. Once I do this though, I can instantly purchase BTC&#039;s online. No more waiting in bank lines. <br /><br />From what I understand though, this shouldn&#039;t really bother me right?. I&#039;ll purchase the BTC, and they&#039;ll go to my wallet on that site, which does have my ID, but as soon as I send them to my SR wallet, they can&#039;t follow it at all? Unless things have changed, wallet address&#039; haven&#039;t got labels for what site they&#039;re linked to, they&#039;re just wallet address&#039; right?<br /><br />I was going to buy the BTC to the address that has my ID linked, then send them to a friend over seas (100% trustworthy) with an anonymous wallet, who would then send it to my SR address. <br /><br />Is there any flaws in this? Thanks in advance

Where? I didn&#039;t think anywhere was that cheap.<br />

If you legitimately are interested in selling some BTC&#039;s though, send me a message, just don&#039;t affect me going first to any, &quot;you give halve first,&nbsp; then I&#039;ll give&quot;. My 3 post count doens&#039;t automatically make me an idiot lol.<br /><br />Moving this thread into BTC&#039;s, threads just getting spammed for 50 post lel
