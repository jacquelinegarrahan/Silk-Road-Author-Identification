				You were asked to choose&nbsp; PIN when you made an account. You probably forgot it. Make a new bitcoin address.

				I was in the same boat as you. Unfortunately I already added BCs to the account so now I have to wait for the PIN reset.

				When making your account you were asked for a pin for safety ie so anytime you order you need that pin to make the transaction it&#039;s just like a credit card pin if your still having probs and can&#039;t wait for your new pin reset just send a pm to sr support and they&#039;ll help you out a bit faster I should think than waiting a week for a reset you best be mighty polite though with sugar on top but just don&#039;t try stuff on your own as you could lose all your btc altogether so wish you the best good luck and hope this advice helps you out
