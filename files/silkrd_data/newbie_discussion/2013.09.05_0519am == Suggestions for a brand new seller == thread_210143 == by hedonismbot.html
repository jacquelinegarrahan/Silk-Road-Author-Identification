				Hello!&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in selling on the Road.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie as far as selling goes, but I am proficient with PGP, Tails, drive encryption, and Silk Road.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a buyer, but now I&#039;d like to try my hand at selling.&nbsp; I was wondering if any regulars had some suggestions about starting out, especially with the new feedback system.&nbsp; I have read over the seller FAQ, but any information even if I&#039;ve already heard it, is very welcome.

				Once you get your vendor account set up, post in the forums (product offers) and give out a few samples for reviews. Everyone loves samples, plus it&#039;ll give you some feedback.

An easy way to distort the new feedback system is to advertise a &quot;Special Offer&quot; only to buyers with very high statistics.<br /><br />Other than that, advertise, advertise, advertise. Keep an active forum presence, be punctual in reply and treat your customers with respect. You business will grow naturally from there.<br /><br />Bean

				Yup. As big of a pain in the ass as it may be. COMMUNICATE! When you get feedback and a 4 rating because everything was awesome except one &quot;this or that&quot;. Dont take it personally. I have given great vendors a 4 of 5 because everything they did was awesome. But they shipped a little too risky as far as packaging goes. I mentioned it and got BANNED from ordering. And I wasnt even a jerk or anything. I did the correct thing and gave a good &quot;4&quot; review and honest feedback. And I understand that this is actually an often occurrence here on SR now. And it shows yet another small flaw in our review systems. Anyway. Take 4 rating and feedback as an opportunity to improve and help protect yourself and your clients.

				This is the problem and why so many shitty vendors keep going because if you tell the truth you get banned every buyer needs to band together and start giving honest feedback they cant ban everyone..&nbsp; that is one good thing about the discuss boards but you cant tell if the buyer has bought of the vendor or is talking shit

The problem doesn&#039;t stand with the seller, it comes from a hand full of buyers trying to take advantage of a vendors generosity. In response, it is only natural that a seller defends himself and his business, unfortunately, being an anonymous marketplace means the only way to punish individuals is to punish everyone.<br /><br />Admittedly their will be one or two vendors that are bad apples, but the vast majority, especially new enterprises crave honest feedback in order to improve. Constant improvement leads to buyer satisfaction which leads to repeat business. Simple.<br /><br />B.
