				I wasn&#039;t planning to buy at all. I just wanted to warn people about this certain vendor. There&#039;s no way in hell anyone would sell you a QP of white widdow for 320. You can easily spot a FAG a mile away ahaha&nbsp; ;D

				i know what you mean but there&#039;s not much he can do for people who choose not to use escrow. if people fall for this too good to be true shit then it&#039;s just weeding out the gullible idiots who probably shouldn&#039;t be buying on here anyway.
