				I&#039;ve been on here for a while, on SR that is but never made a forum account so just made this one cause I&#039;m looking to buy today a gmail account that is verified maybe via sms so I can use it with tor.<br />I want to communicate with a friend who only uses google talk but I refuse to communicate unless it&#039;s over tor vpn.<br />I know I don&#039;t need the lecture about gmail / google talk I know they are evil. Just the only thing this friend has. <br />So please let me know anyone if you&#039;re willing to sell a gmail account or make one for me real quick and I&#039;ll pay via btc today asap

				This is something you can do yourself.<br />If the issue is you don&#039;t wish to provide a valid email to google so you can create one, just make a hushmail account then use that for registering the google one.<br />Sound good?

				Ah yes I tried that as I do have other email addresses but it wanted me to sms verify and that is something I don&#039;t want to do to tie my phone number to a gmail account.<br />I need to speak with him tomorrow so I won&#039;t be able to get a new sim or anything like that by then so I&#039;d rather spend btc and buy it off someone via bitcoin if possible<br />

				Oh ok, I gotcha.<br />Ya know, if you use a smart phone, you &#039;could&#039; download burner and make a new number for $2.00 , use it to verify, then delete the number. Burner is pretty awesome for lots of things like that ;)<br />Anyway, good luck.<br />Cheers!

				If you just need an untraceable number for verification why not buy a cheap, throwaway phone for cash, use that, then dispose of it?

				I can pay 0.15 bitcoin, so that&#039;s around $20 <br />You&#039;re right I could get a another phone and make a gmail account sms verify from it and I&#039;d do that tomorrow if noone on here can help out, but figured I rather spread the btc see if anyone wants a quick $20 otherwise I&#039;d have to go to store and buy sim.<br />Appreciate any help or if someone wants to make a different offer.&nbsp; many sites sell like 20 for $20 but don&#039;t take BTC.<br />

				Forgive me if i&#039;m wrong but, does this not leave the person accountable for any and all activity then related to that gmail account??<br /><br />It seems crazy someone asking to pay for a gmail account when it is so handy to just sort it yourself?<br /><br />Not criticising youor preraching but just saying how it seems. + trying to make up my post count lol <br /><br />Peace out.
