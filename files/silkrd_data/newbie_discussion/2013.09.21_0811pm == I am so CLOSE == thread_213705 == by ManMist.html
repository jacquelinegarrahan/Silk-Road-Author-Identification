				After 3 weeks of hammering on pgp and gpg I finally got a couple of public addresses to go into my key manager.&nbsp; Next I saved an encrypted message on the clipboard but keep getting the GPA error message - &quot;Clipboard contains no valid encrypted data&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where am I missing it?&nbsp; Thanks

				Really Trippy?&nbsp; thanks for nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve highlighted the message in the forum and copied it onto the clipboard but am not given the option to &quot;save as&quot;.&nbsp; There appears to be no merge capability between the clipboard and the Key manager.&nbsp; How can this be so hard.

				if you have their key, you can use it to send them an encrypted message, they have to have your key to send you one.<br /><br />to be honest the whole thing took me about 2 weeks to crack and once you have it you realise how easy it is and feel like a twat but getting there is hard.

				That neg karma is from Dr gonzo, I went public about a CD that he caused. He got mad and went on a full scale bash campaign. I was being honest with you. You&#039;re what I&#039;d call low hanging fruit, so carry on we need fruit.

				yeah, so there&#039;s that I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Turns out the Tor download of gpg4usb prevented completion of the software.&nbsp; Reloaded through mozilla and wala, I&#039;m off to newbie gpg sticky to try it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for not wanting to share

				I found Kleopatra the easiest to work with for PGP. Maybe you can give that a shot and see if it helps. Once you DL it I can try and help you out if you get stuck.

				The documentation shipped with the Kleo / GPG / Tor browser package is lengthy, but very easy to read, and explains it all pretty clearly.<br /><br />Try reading through it till you&#039;ve covered the bit that explains how to encrypt / decrypt. You&#039;ll get it dude, don&#039;t panic.

				I think ManMist is up and running. I sent him a PGP in a PM and he was able to decrypt it successfully. <br /><br />Though I wonder about my own public key because his is three times longer than mine.<br /><br />Maybe I need to lengthen my password.

It is recommended to use a secure password, however.<br /><br />You can choose what length your want your public key to be when generating it. I believe 1024 is the default key length.<br /><br />I have seen several people with a 2048 character key, but 1024 is much more common, and compact.

				It&#039;s really easy, you shouldn&#039;t be trying to decrypt anything using the SR. The only one doing the decrypting is your vendor. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what you do using GnuPG (The easiest one for newbies.)<br /><br />Go to the vendor page, copy his PGP key, and put it in a notepad file. Save it .<br />Click on the &quot;Import&quot; button and find that notepad file. <br />You should now have a new public key loaded into the program. There will be a new name and email, something like Drug Dealer, DrugDealer@Silkroad.com <br />Go into clipboard, type in your shipping information.<br /><br />ManMist <br />3010 Algerian Palms Apt 302<br />Houston, TX 77003<br />United States of America (if your orris international) <br /><br />Click Encrypt, find Drug Dealer, DrugDealer@Silkroad.com or whatever name the vendors public key puts it as<br />You will get a bunch of encrypted text. DO NOT MESS WITH THIS OR TRY TO DECRYPT IT. Copy that, place your order and checkout, and in the message, paste that key. Your vendor will be able to decrypt it. You should not be decrypting anything.
