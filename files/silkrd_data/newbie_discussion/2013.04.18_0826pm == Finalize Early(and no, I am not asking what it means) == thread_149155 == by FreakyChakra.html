				Hey everyone, total newb here obviously.<br />I just placed an order with Adderoller for a single 30 mg Adderall. He looks like he is a new vendor judging by his vendor page, but it doesn&#039;t say anything about newbs FE&#039;ing on his profile.<br />What do you guys think? I am pretty uncomfortable doing it but if everyone had to do it at some point I guess I&#039;ll have to.<br />Any thoughts? Anyone order from him or any seasoned SR vets have any input about the whole finalize early thing when you are new?

				This won&#039;t be the last you hear it but listen up...<br /><br />DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY<br /><br />It&#039;s rather simple, don&#039;t do it. At any point a respected vendor can turn rogue, why chance it....<br /><br />I have an idea of what others will say- Don&#039;t finalize....get it?&nbsp; ;)

				Did he ask you to finalize early?<br /><br />I would personally be more comfortable if he was established, but him being new makes you two on an even playing field. I would message him and ask if you could refrain on FE, in exchange for future business (as long as you aren&#039;t the scammer here).<br /><br />If you FE, you give up any and all right to complain about getting ripped off.

				Thanks very much for the info, I will message him about not FEing in return for future business and will update this thread on what happens. I was really close to doing it, but something keeps telling me not to, even though I am only spending like $25..<br /><br />And no, I am not a scammer. I don&#039;t understand how I could even try to rip him off, I am the one spending the money and sending my address to a total stranger. If anyone should be worried about getting scammed shouldn&#039;t it be me?

				Ok well I had a feeling I should not. I am going to hold off and continue searching, which sucks because I could use the Adderall within the next week due to finals and tests and whatnot coming up in school. Does anyone know of any good vendors who won&#039;t make me FE or are at least reputable enough? Sorry if I am not supposed to ask that in the forums, be gentle!!

				Update: just heard back from the vendor and thanks to anonymous drug user&#039;s advice, the vendor has waived finalizing early. <br />Adderoller has kept it real, I will update &amp; give him a review on product once received, but everyone thinking about getting some Adderall should hit this guy up! Adderall is damn expensive here but his price is relatively low, $22 for 30mg.

				Buyers here really need to get on this FE thing, it cannot become the norm for all sellers to require FE, it just makes for a scam site. I got burned recently by Evilution, a long time respected seller who I&#039;d bought from previously who turned scam artist and ran off with my bitcoins and my drugs.<br />From now on NO exceptions.
