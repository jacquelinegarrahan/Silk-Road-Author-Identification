				its one thing to wait for it to go from processing-transit<br />but its another to wait until it reaches your door!<br /><br />i keep wanting to order more stuff but havent even received my first package yet<br /><br />so pretty much ive been blazing, playing video games, reading this forum and searching SR for the newest goodies<br /><br />not to mention i&#039;ve been home sick this week so ive had a lot of extra free time

				this is an awesome thread<br /><br />i am in the same boat, i am waiting on 8 orders right now, and I am praying that at least some of them come tomorrow for the weekend!<br /><br />so yea, smoking a bowl works, try not to think too hard about it because once it does arrive, your heart rate will soar and elation will pour over you :)

				What do I do while I wait? The same thing I&#039;ve been doing before I was using SR, moving on with my life. I dont sit around all day counting down the seconds until my next package arrives. Either you&#039;re still living with your parents or are a dealer if you have no commitments whatsoever.

				I&#039;m sorry but if you need things to do other than just sit and wait for your orders, you might have a problem.&nbsp; Do you not have responsibilities, hobbies, interest, or other things in life?<br /><br />If you dont, you need to pick them up and not just worry about what you order on SR.&nbsp; For me, ordering on SR is no different than something on Amazon or Ebay.&nbsp; I purchase a product and it will come when it comes.

				Study, read how to do shit on the internet, listen to language programs, do work around the house,&nbsp; think of shit, draw, play guitar, get in shape, watch netflix,&nbsp; feed my dog, live life, read/watch news, go to concerts, go to your nearest city or park and do shit thats happening there, look for good SR deals, idk basically go on with your normal routine... It is your first order, right? So just do what you normally do in life without SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t sit around and let yourself create bad thoughts about the package!&nbsp; <br /><br />You should also find another place to send stuff in your spare time.&nbsp; You could send it to my place (the safest fortress on earth) ::)
