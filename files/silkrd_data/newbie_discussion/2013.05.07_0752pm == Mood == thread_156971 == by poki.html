				Hey people,<br /><br />just wanted to share this with you. A post from a guy, some years ago on bluelight.ru I liked very much.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Poki<br /><br />j-bird 17-04-2009 08:12<br /><br />You love the taste. The funny smell. The texture. The way it looks as you&#039;re heating it up on a warm plate and railed up in beautiful lines or on the back of a toilet cistern in a cranking club. You love the power it gives you, in your own brain and socially - all of a sudden, you&#039;re the centre of attention, everyone wants you, everyone loves you, they hang on to every word you say. Everything that everyone says makes so much sense. Your heart races, and you feel like you are God.<br /><br />The last of the bag has since gone. There&#039;s nothing left but awkward silence and a deep, dark longing for more. You want more. Doesn&#039;t matter how really, but you do. Doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s going to show. Time to go. Drive home, sun coming up, sweaty palms on the steering wheel, licking your lips as you taste the familiar bitterness in odd pockets here and there.<br /><br />Shower is long and hot. You blow most of the shit that&#039;s been up in your head out while you&#039;re washing up. You think about sucking down what might be coke back into your mouth but the water washes it away before you become that desperate. You laugh to yourself and think &quot;Oh my folks would be so proud&quot;. Towel off and sit back in bed, hoping to sleep and face the rest of the day. You need rest.<br /><br />Who are you fooling?<br /><br />There&#039;s no rest. <br /><br /><br />Clearweb-Link: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/399832-Cocaine-Crack-Serious-Discussion-Only/page4

				Thanks for sharing that.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting to read.&nbsp; And okay, I know I&#039;ve been going on about Irvine Welsh in another thread, but there&#039;s a really good part of Trainspotting (the novel) where Renton talks about why he does heroin.&nbsp; It&#039;s a valid point, and good to hear in this world where living without misery is a crime.&nbsp;
