				so, a lot of top vendors, require new customers with less than 5, or 10 orders to FE.&nbsp; What should do for a top selling item that has this requirement...? FE and cross fingers??? I see a lot of feedback &quot;fe, will update&quot; Can u really update the feedback you have left???<br /><br />If i tell the seller, i do not FE, then the most possible is to receive nothing , and get an amount of refund from the escrow, without the seller having even sent the item.. So FE for good reputation??? <br /><br />So i want your opinions, its something i see from a lot top sellers...

				I guess they are not top sellers for no reason, they must be trustworthy. But I understand you don&#039;t want to FE without being sure they&#039;ll send what you paid for.<br />Personally I only bought one thing but the seller didn&#039;t request me to FE so I didn&#039;t and I&#039;m still waiting for the package.<br />You have 2 options, either you buy some very cheap and useless things to have 5 successful transactions or you try to find a seller who doesn&#039;t request you to FE.

				Well my personal story,<br /><br />I have bought a variety of products in the last 15 months (about 45 in total) of which I FE&#039;d 3 times. <br />2 times I lost my money and had no recourse to be able to get my money back and the other one took forever (about 6 weeks and I still wasn&#039;t really satisfied with the outcome) to be sorted out. <br />Every other transaction I have done without FEing, have all worked out professionally &amp; efficiently. If a vendor insists on FE, there is probably a reason and guaranteed it won&#039;t be in your favor. You can&#039;t get much help from SR, because you have finalised the transaction.<br />If you are looking to save 10%-15% to buy from someone insisting on FE, you need to weigh up the person and their operation and decide if it is really worth it. <br /><br />But even some of the highest rated Vendors (ETM, MIMM, Nevita) have been well known for pulling scams on unsuspecting clients.<br />&nbsp;Escrow is there for a reason. The sooner everyone refuses to FE, the sooner SR can develop a great marketplace otherwise it will just be another BMR. <br />

				I made my first purchase a week ago and was asked to FE. I understand that having no stats kinda equals having no trust. It would be lovely if everybody was honest but as i&#039;m sure anyboby who&#039;s brought stuff on the streets knows, they are not. I did FE, but only after finding a vendor with nothing but good comments on his/her vendor page and on the forums. I also checked the vendors new comments for a few days prior to deciding to order. When I did finally order I was given all the help I needed via PM with the vendor. The order arrived 3 days later and was exactly as advertised, right down to the shipping time! Maybe I got lucky or maybe my researching paid off? Either way I just wanted to share my 1st experience with other newbies who are worried about FE.

				Never FE.<br />You&#039;re better off buying from someone who isn&#039;t a &quot;top seller&quot; but doesn&#039;t require FE.<br />That way your money stays in escrow and you will not lose it.<br />Start small and buy a couple smaller items to build up history.<br />Don&#039;t auto-finalize and try to not get any refunds.<br />All of these can and will show up in your history.

				You can&#039;t FE until the seller has put it in transit.<br />So he&#039;s not trying to scam you if he&#039;s told you in advance that he requires FE.<br />It won&#039;t be sent out until FE&#039;d.<br />Thats why you just never agree to FE.

				I finalized early with a trusted seller and it worked out so I cant say never finalize early.<br />And yes you can change your comment and rating later but it seems some people just forget<br /><br />If its absolutely the best deal that you can find, the vendor has lots of transactions and you have the possibility to buy something for a rather small amount of money then Id say do it.

				Think of it this way, if the vendor was completely reputable, he wouldn&#039;t need you to FE. I realize that sellers are taking a risk, but buyers are taking much larger risks especially at massive quantities and being expected to FE. I wouldn&#039;t FE ever, and if everyone was like that I think scammers would be less encouraged to scam.

				Same can be said about any vendor. (even using escrow, you may only be entitled to Percentage of your money back)<br />Any vendor can turn. Be very weary of a vendor who&#039;s score has been dropping rapidly due to any type of mail problem. They are likely to eventually take your coins... send them to a fresh account... and pay the vendor bond with it.... rather than be forced to suffer with poor ratings.<br /><br />I&#039;ve FE&#039;d on some items.<br />If you do it. Just think of it like this. In the real world there is no such thing as a &quot;Drug Deal Refund&quot;<br />We&#039;re all very spoiled here on Silk Road.<br />In the real world, if you get took, you got took.<br />Don&#039;t Ever Ever FE money you aren&#039;t willing to lose.<br />Don&#039;t Ever Ever Ever Ever trust a Vendor&#039;s Silk Road Feedback. It is extremely easy to fake!<br />Only Only Only Only Follow a vendor on This forum to know if they are legit!<br />That is the best advice I can give you.<br />After that, you&#039;re on your own.

				I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d for a few vendors.... After having done what I felt was sufficient SR Forum research.<br />OPI did not steal from me.<br />PeoplesDrugStore did not steal from me.<br />Purest does not steal from me and I repeatedly FE as a courtesy but he randomly does things like upgrade my shipping to Express for free.<br /><br />I just FE&#039;d for AfterHours 30 seconds ago.<br />I&#039;ve spent well over 140BTC in 3 months and have lost 0.<br /><br />Research your vendors on the forum. If you choose to FE.... consider it a possible loss in the very beginning of the transaction.<br />If you get took... blast the Vendor on this forum. Please give the vendor enough time to try to fix a problem of coarse! But if they steal from you, blast them hard core and it really does effect their business.<br /><br />Few people know how the Feedback system even works here on Silk Road.<br />Did you know that your Negative rating will eventually be overcome by new ratings?<br />Did you know that if a vendor has 100 percent on 300 most recent transactions, your 1x 1/5 Bad rating wont even bust 99%<br />If that vendor continues good business.... it will dissolve entirely.

				very useful all of your answers , thanks for that. So indeed some vendors are ok with FE, not stealing money. I think i can try MIMM for first orders . who does not require FE. <br />Even he tries to steal me, i will be able to tell that in the feedback page, so the next ones can see it. But i have read somewhere about blacklisting specific negative feedbacks, is there a way someone leaves negative feedback and not appear at all at the feedback list?<br />Now, regarding the way items appear at the page, sorting through the &quot;seller rank&quot; is what actually shows who are the best vendors (in descending order) ?? How do you prefer the sorting of items when you browse at the SR?
