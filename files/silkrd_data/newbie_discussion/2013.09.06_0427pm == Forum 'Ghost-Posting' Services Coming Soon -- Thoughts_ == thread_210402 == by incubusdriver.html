				Hello everybody<br /><br />I&#039;m a professional writer and I&#039;m working on getting a vendor account set up so I can sell my services to the fine folk here on Silk Road.<br /><br />There&#039;s already a debate about this in the &#039;restricted areas&#039; of the forum, but I thought I&#039;d make an announcement here too to give the &#039;Newbies&#039; a voice.<br /><br />Perhaps the service that will become most popular here in the Newbie Barrel, is my Forum &#039;Ghost-Posting&#039; - I will be offering to jumpstart your forum presence by publishing relevant and insightful posts on your behalf, to (a) draw attention to your alias here on the forums, and (b) get you started in the Big Boys&#039; Yard sooner.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also be offering professional vendor profile rewrites, product listing makeovers and general &#039;non-Silk-Road&#039; writing services.<br /><br />The service is not available yet, so don&#039;t start reaching for your BitCoin wallets right away... but feel free to discuss your thoughts below.<br /><br />Positive, negative, in-between... everybody&#039;s opinion is respected and valued.<br /><br />Thanks :-)<br /><br />IncubusDriver

In the &#039;real world&#039;, I&#039;ve done contracts for countless companies who don&#039;t have the ability to express themselves properly, yet have the most incredible products, products with genuinely unique features, products that far surpass their competitors&#039;... and because of this, they fail miserably when they don&#039;t deserve to. This happens a lot. Their competitors on the other hand may have an OK product, an average customer service team, a reasonable price... etc. But because they have a fantastic marketing team, they rake in millions. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210402.msg1521185#msg1521185">Quote from: Tiger on September 06, 2013, 10:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You seem sound enough though and have the right intentions so I wish you well!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, that&#039;s kind of you :-)<br /><br />And thanks again for joining the discussion.

				The whole &#039;copywriting&#039; concept is an awesome idea.<br /><br />Not sure I&#039;d be comfortable with ghost posting, cos although I might not be the most perfect english speaker, I don&#039;t trust anybody else to talk for me!<br /><br />Id definitely be up for some help with off-sr projects though (see other message in other thread i sent you)

				I don&#039;t think I like the ghost forum posting idea, but I definitely have thought that quite a few of the vendors could really use a profile cleanup and better product pages.<br /><br />I am personally against the forum posting since the forum seems to me to be more about the actual voice of the person posting. <br /><br />I will say good luck to you, and hope that some vendors hop on for some profile and product page revisions.

				Sounds like a great business plan! I&#039;d do it myself if I weren&#039;t so busy with my shitty job. I really couldn&#039;t care less who writes what on vendor pages as long as I can understand their policies clearly. Only thing that matters is whether or not they deliver the goods and how, as far as I&#039;m concerned. Look forward to attempting to figure out which ones are you.

In the real world, business owners who start out with a real marketing budget will not likely be the individuals writing their content, their press releases, their public &#039;presence&#039; - they&#039;ll be paying a copywriter or PR expert to do it for them.<br /><br />Similarly, on the Silk Road I believe there is scope to encourage healthy market competition by making services like this available. Of course, these are just my thoughts and I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve dropped by with yours :-) +1 to you.<br /><br />Incubusdriver
