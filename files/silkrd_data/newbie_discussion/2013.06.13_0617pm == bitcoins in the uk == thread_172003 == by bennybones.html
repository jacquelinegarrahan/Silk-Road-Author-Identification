				Really struggling to get bitcoins here. Tried BTC4cash as it was recommended by a vendor but the tor link doesn&#039;t seem to work. Also tried Britcoins but just don&#039;t get it, says to add to cart and then wait for them to get in touch. Really? how does that work? I don&#039;t have any coins at all so can&#039;t complete the order for 0.01BTC. Do they get notified when someone has added to their cart? Really having difficulty with this starting to think the hassle of getting coins isn&#039;t worth it.

				Bitbargain is fine, very quick but the rates aren&#039;t great and by doing a bank transfer it leaves proof that you&#039;ve bought coins, should anyone wish to investigate you.<br /><br />These guys came through for me and have done plenty of transactions, they do a cash in the mail service and you don&#039;t need any coins to buy from them in the first place.- http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c536b90105<br /><br />Localbitcoins will also allow you to find someone local to trade cash with.

				Bitbargain is just as easy to use as Local Bitcoin, except more expensive. Always. Go ahead, compare bank transfer prices now. <br /><br />Of course you&#039;re free to spend more if you wish&nbsp; :o

				Another vote for localbitcoins.com here.<br /><br />Of course there is Mt Gox if you are willing to use another deposit method and you have all the required paperwork... :)<br /><br />Also bitcointalk.org forums is a good place to trade various things for BTC.<br /><br />Fuck it, for 0.01 btc, I&#039;ll send it to you.

				Reggie I&#039;ve done it a bunch of times already and check the vendors feedback, I dont know why people are so skeptical of bitcoin vendors, bennybones look if you can afford a .1% chance of losing £100 quid just try this vendor, I gain nothing from it I&#039;m just trying to help you out and I&#039;ve never had a problem, I wouldn&#039;t try £5k but £100 at a time gets u plenty of goodies mate, good luck

Feedback can be faked, but it is obvious when you compare vendors -- took me less than 3 seconds to pick it up when I checked today -- and failing that, ask people who have bought from them before, providing they&#039;re certified.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t rocket science to figure out who you can trust and who you can&#039;t when it comes to bitcoin vendors.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Have always used BitBargain with no issues, little more expensive but with bank transfer you get the coins very quickly.

It is not uncommon for some vendors to use them. They may decide to use shills when they are starting out, or when they are losing a lot of custom suddenly, in an effort to restore faith to prospective buyers looking through this feedback on their vendor&#039;s page. Additionally, they may use a shill on the forum to put in a glowing recommendation of themself on their review thread. They typically contain a handful of posts, and are obvious.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
