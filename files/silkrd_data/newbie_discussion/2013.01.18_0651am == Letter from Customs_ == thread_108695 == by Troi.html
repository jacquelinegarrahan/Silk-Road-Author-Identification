				I wasn&#039;t planning on asking about this, but since I have to make some bullshit posts, I might as well... <br /><br />I got a letter from (US) Customs today saying they seized something (lsd).<br /><br />I know I can&#039;t use this address for non-domestic orders (right?), but would it still be safe if I only ordered from vendors within the US?

				Also, the day after the letter was sent (before I knew about it, of course) I crossed the border to and from Canada. On my way back they made me get out of my car and walk over to the building with two armed guys on both sides of me and thoroughly searched my car. (Usually, if it&#039;s a random search, they&#039;ll let you drive your car over to the area where they do the search.) <br /><br />So, I&#039;m thinking that I got flagged in Border Control&#039;s system. Anyone have any experience/knowledge about this? <br /><br />I cross the border frequently, so I&#039;m hoping I don&#039;t have to go through this bs every time.

				im no pro, but i cant imagine you are now flagged in a million databases as potential lsd slinger, unless they seized some heavy amount.&nbsp; besides, i doubt they have the man power / money to keep thousands of addresses flagged (and more every day), and wait for these people to get shit for a seach.&nbsp;

				In my experience and second-hand readings, it means you&#039;re flagged.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean you have a van waiting outside your house right now, but it bumps up the risk factor several times.<br />When I&#039;d get things from grey-market foreign pharmacies, I once got a love letter, so I stopped that for a while.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since changed addresses and ordering styles, and I&#039;ve received many items without problem.<br />

				It happened to me once, but nothing happened, and I&#039;ve ordered lots of stuff without problems ever since...<br /><br />So the check might have just been random.

				That still seems a little over the top, that they would &quot;flag&quot; an address for a seized letter.&nbsp; There would probably be hundreds of thousands of these, and you would need an assembly line of people to keep checking packages destined to &quot;flagged&quot; addresses.&nbsp; I know on the main forums there was a dude that had did an internship at the postal service, maybe he can comment.&nbsp; It just seems a bit much that they start checking all international packages going to Mr. X at certain address.&nbsp; <br /><br />By that logic, you could just ship to another address you are at (former address maybe), or change the name to someone else that lives at your place.&nbsp; Or the name of your friend (fake roomate sorta thing).&nbsp; Or send it to your neighbor that you are always home before.&nbsp; The whole customs thing just seems a little overblown, but then again, who knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe they watch for a short period of time, in case you are importing kilos or something, but still.&nbsp; We need to pay a customs dude for an AMA..

				its a form letter-<br />they are not coming to get you<br />they are not interested in you<br />they might think you&#039;re dumb enough to come pick it up-as they suggest in the letter<br />but just chill--i&#039;ve seen these forms photocopied so poorly you could barely read them--just know some dude is rolling on your dime--and wish him/her a good trip and write it off to the universe. you&#039;re good.<br />jones21

				Just getting the letter, I would just switch to a different address to get the shit, and get a good story down in case someone wants to &#039;interview&#039; you.&nbsp; What does LE actually need to make a case against you?&nbsp; Just some random package that you deny knowing anything about?&nbsp; They would need alot more than that.
