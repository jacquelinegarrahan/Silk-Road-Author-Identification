				I understand this question comes up a lot but because postal systems vary from country to country what do most UK users do about receiving deliveries? Real or fake name? Home or alternative address? Do people vary it depending if its come from a domestic or an overseas vendor? Etc. I have pretty much every step cracked other than this one. Thanks.

				real name home address works if you&#039;ve lived there a while and the postman will notice a fake name. you can use a real sounding fake at a rental property in a city, that should be fine. depends on what kind of alternative address you have in mind tbh, po boxes raise flags at customs and i think in the uk have to be tied to your real identity anyway so would be pretty pointless.

I live in a house divided into rented flats with a communal letterbox/entrance hall (I know all the other tenants).

Would it be safer to use a name like this ex-tenant for example? I know for certain that none of the other tenants living here ever move or open mail that&#039;s not addressed to them. Alternatively do UK postmen deliver packages to houses like this one if it&#039;s with a fake name? In which case maybe that&#039;d be an even safer bet?

				I&#039;ve had bud sent from Canada for a few years. <br /><br />What I do is use my real name and address, but I always request that above my name they put &quot;To the parents or guardian of:&quot;<br /><br />Adding those 6 little words I&#039;ve never missed a beat. If it looks like its got something to do with a kid, no one seems too interested.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know how this might work if your postman knows there are no children at that address, but it works for me!

				If you&#039;re receiving a small, &#039;personal use&#039; quantity of product (e.g. up to a 1/4 oz of weed) I wouldn&#039;t worry too much - real name, home address. For larger quantities, different delivery locations should probably be found.

				I&#039;ve recently placed my first order with a UK vendor, sent my real name/address with PGP and product arrived promptly :)<br /><br />The way I view it is this:<br /><br />I&#039;d rather have to act dumb on &#039;controlled&#039; delivery, or have my stuff confiscated; than be caught red handed sat in a car with some arsehole I don&#039;t even like, buying a bag of shwag bud that&#039;s been picked less than 2 days earlier.

				I live in a house with other students but we get A LOT of spam from the previous year&#039;s tenants - so I just use their name; we have no idea who these people are anyway and Royal Mail don&#039;t tie names to addresses AFAIK. I&#039;ve only ordered twice though, both LSD.

He&#039;s just walking around the streets putting the stuff through people&#039;s doors. I doubt he knows or cares what he puts through the hundreds of doors. If you get caught, it will be before it&#039;s in his hands. It&#039;s not his job to stop drugs from being delivered. His job is just to take a big pile of envelopes and packages and put them through letterboxes. Even if he did suspect something, he probably wouldn&#039;t care.
