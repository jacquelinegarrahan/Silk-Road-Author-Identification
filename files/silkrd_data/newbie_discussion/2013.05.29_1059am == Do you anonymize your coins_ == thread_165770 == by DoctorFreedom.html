				so correct me if I&#039;m wrong. (vendor stand point)<br /><br />start at the beginning. Hypothetically I want to open a vendor acct.<br />so I go about purchasing some bitcoins in cash. (this step alone still confuses me. I go to a coffee shop and meet someone wait til the transfer is done which takes 10 mins or more? sure as hell not doing it from my bank acct)<br />I&#039;ve got my bitcoins in my wallet. which is sort of anonymous. It&#039;s mine but no one knows my name or IP attached to the address????? <br />Then I go into my wallet and turn on &quot;connect through socks4 proxy ....&quot; and now I can send my relatively anonymous coins to SR acct? <br />I then use them to open my vendor acct (I assume this is where the tumbler comes in, the coins come in and go through a tumbler) <br />So everything is set up and ready to go I can start to buy and sell things and its all anonymous right? Then when i want to move coins out of my SR wallet it goes through tumbler again on its way to whatever destination wallet I choose?? <br />what if I choose my own wallet on my phone/computer ? does it track to my IP ? <br /><br />Sorry I&#039;m still unfamiliar with the concept and I&#039;m trying to reconcile my understanding of Bitcoins by thinking of them as paper currency and how it would be used in a market place.

				The bitcoins could potentially be tracked to your ip but that would be no different than taking $10 out of an ATM that a drug dealer paid into the bank. The coins have been through some other processes which no longer links them to SR. <br /><br />If you want to be really sure you can run bitcoin-qt through tor. Open vidalia &gt; preferences &gt; advanced, here you will see something like &quot;127.0.0.1 through port 9151&quot; (these are the numbers on the newest release but they do change from time to time so be sure to check). Then in bitcoin-qt go to preferences &gt; network, check the box &quot;connect through SOCKS proxy and key in &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; through port 9150 using SOCKS version 5 (note that I didn&#039;t make a mistake here, the port numbers are supposed to be different).

				I didnt used to run it through fog, but now i always do, i thought if this one extra thing could make the difference somewhere down the road then ill look back and feel stupid not for using it so fuck it, one more safety precaution couldnt hurt.<br /><br />*Before i started using Bitcoin Fog i sent it to a few different wallet addresses before my SR wallet.

				I usually send it through a few wallets and then make new addresses. Although now that I know about bitcoinfog I could try using that.

				From what I&#039;ve heard Bitcoinfog is a good solution to anonymize your money. It&#039;s been for two years, I think. Don&#039;t forget to hide your transactions&#039; IP through TOR.

				I used bitcoinfog for a couple of deposits so far, no problem. But from what I gathered, if you run your Bitcoin client through Tor, no one should be able to track you.

				Ok here is what I THINK that I know<br /><br />- SR mixes the coins on it&#039;s own, so nobody will know what exactly you sold or bought BUT I believe it can be traced that they came from or went to SR. No more details than that but still someone will know you had business on SR.<br />- bitcoin-qt doesn&#039;t provide the IP of the sender/receiver but the IP of the nod that processed it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				If you purchase your bitcoins in a way that does not require verification (does not require you to give up your identity) then your coins are anonymous from the get go and you don&#039;t need to tumble them. And yes, SR does some tumbling of its own.
