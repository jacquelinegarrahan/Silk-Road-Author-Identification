				Hello hello I would like to report I got more than one envelope today corresponding to orders made on Saturday and Tuesday - Really not sure how Tuesday vendor got the package out but damn I gotta hand it to you vendors.&nbsp; You are all awesome.&nbsp; The envelopes were left in mailbox and apparently free of FBI tampering - unless they have nano-trackers implanted within the substances and they expect me to eat/snort/smoke them.&nbsp; :S&nbsp; WHICH I WILL GLADLY DO.&nbsp; Still free, as far as I know, on the west coast of the land of Freedom, but who knows there might be agents outside my door anytime so it&#039;s always a good time to say adios, amigos, and many thanks.<br /><br />Anyway, when we regroup and recover I will remember who to pay for debts, I mean technically we all lost something but without naming names I will just say I&#039;ll remember you, thank you for your services, I owe you.&nbsp; A lot of you made significant sacrifices for us and I hope you are all safe and relocated.&nbsp; Wish I had finalized early on these, but who woulda known...<br /><br />Update before I posted, I&#039;m thwacked right now.&nbsp; Getting shit done.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a thought, it&#039;s really hard for us druggies to keep on it, not slip up, cause the feds certainly don&#039;t use at all.&nbsp; So we have to come to some sort of agreement, rather than fight back in every way...I see people here getting very angry wanting to find feds who WERE DOING THEIR LEGAL JOBS.&nbsp; and who have done OTHER COOL THINGS LIKE BUST PEDOPHILES AND WHATNOT.&nbsp; The drug laws suck these days.&nbsp; We need serious reform.&nbsp; It looks like the major point here with DPR is that he (whether intentionally or not, or actually or not, because we very well know this may be a fabrication) &quot;hired a hitman&quot;&nbsp; he involved death in the situation.&nbsp; This seems extremely hypocritical.&nbsp; Anyway now I&#039;m just blabbing but I hope you know the drugs work and they&#039;re still coming, so unless you got a big order I wouldn&#039;t be too scared of the mailbox.. If you have to sign for something that looks like an SR package its probably a controlled delivery and I would reject that shit&nbsp; as a loss.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve been free for a day after opening my illegal mail.<br /><br />This country, this world, has a lot of problems.&nbsp; And Guess who is causing them?&nbsp; People!&nbsp; And you are one of them, so, let&#039;s keep banded together...keep your friends close and your enemies, well they are really just friends in disguise.&nbsp; Anyway drugs cause sloppy epiphanies and fun nights.&nbsp; Wish we could apply freedom of speech to freedom of substance.&nbsp; But try going to a doctor and telling them what works for you---DRUG ADDICT!!!<br /><br />Ok end of rave time for sleep.&nbsp; XOXO sr community we will rebuild and vendors run to the hills for now but I will remember you, I promise.&nbsp; When we meet again.&nbsp; Can&#039;t we all just get along?

				I too received a package Friday morning,&nbsp; I ordered an amount of coke from canada about a month ago, it got sent in 2 seperate packages a day apart, i recieved the first half about 3 weeks ago, had completely given up on this bit and suspected my address to be flagged, then out of the blue this friday morning it arrived, just goes to show, can never be sure. Im glad now that i finalized and gave the great vendor the benifit of the doubt and also left him 5/5 and i didnt mention the loss in my review. I really had a feeling this vendor was sound and and wouldnt rip me off and turns out i was right:)&nbsp; <br /><br />Now i ordered a little tester package to be sent after this one to see if my address really was flagged, now im really looking forward to receiving that aswell, and i also finalized on that one too as i was 95% sure it was going to get taken from mail. So apart from all the other money i lost in escrow and my wallet all is good. :)
