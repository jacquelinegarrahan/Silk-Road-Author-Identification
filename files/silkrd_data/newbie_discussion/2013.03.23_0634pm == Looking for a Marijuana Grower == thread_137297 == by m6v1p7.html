				Bline, my friend, how you always find your way to my posts - I do not know. Each time you have come to them with absolutely nothing. Never have I been one to sell cocaine, and yes I have consistantly been looking for a weed connect because I have been consistantly unable to find the right one. But please think of me as a cop because quite frankly i find it annoying seeing your dumbass name in everyone of my posts. thankyou

				I don&#039;t really think anyone would do it at legal stand point. However, you should start networking with other dealers locally eventually they&#039;ll bring you up to the big boys and then you have your connects! That&#039;s how I did it.

				Apologies to anyone that may be offended, but no I am not a cop believe it or not. I am just someone interested in finding top notch at the lowest price. CALL ME CRAZY! but honestly it is no worries, I have no problem getting pot where I am at and quite frankly don&#039;t need a lot of this. Truly I have noticed that a lot of people in the forums are a huge help and then there are the people who quite frankly have nothing better to do with their lives so they use it as what seems to be their own personal private social networking that lets them hide behind a name that can&#039;t be traced. So take it for what its worth, I&#039;m simply just looking for a grower that is willing to work with me on a more private level and offer me more reasonable prices. Because believe it or not you can be paying 2,300 and thinking your getting the deal of a life time but someones making money off you sorry to say. I simply am just coming here for the connection to help save me the money that a lot of people don&#039;t think about.

				No by more reasonable prices I mean 1500-2000/ LB because anything higher than that means a middle man is just making a couple hundred dollars due to the fact that he has that connection to the grower. Honestly was posting in hopes of finding an honest connection but I now see how much criticism people have to offer, and not meaning this directly to anyone but some people on the SR simply just have nothing better to do with their lives. Disagree with anything I say, its fine, this is simply just what I know and how I feel

				Duckman, I get that this might be tough for you to get through a post.<br />I am saying I want the bud at said price. I do not want USPS to ship me pounds among pounds on a weekly basis because that is foolish. I want a grower that is willing to message me, work with me, talk to me, and after I have mad several purchases (through SR if thats what it takes) be willing to do larger amounts on a much larger business scale and let me make it clear, I UNDERSTAND HOW THE ANONYMITY IS A SECURITY BLANKET, but at somepoint they must be willing to make the handshake. I know it must be nice doing business behind a computer and making money, and I get the whole why would they stop. But I consider myself old fashion *COP ALERT* lol but yes I know it might be shocking to you but I don&#039;t enjoy doing business with what feels to be an imaginary person. So call me crazy call me stupid and call me what you want but thats what I have come to the forum for. If I find it great, if not my life keeps going with the same price I have been getting it for. Simple as that

				Yes, I am essentially trying to make more money that is the idea.<br />Yes, SR is great for anonymity but that&#039;s only good to a certain point. If you were to dish out 50K every week you would be in the same position I am in. Anyone that is truly in the business already knows you don&#039;t say a word regardless, and the second you do your done in just about every sense of the word. And why would a grower do that?<br />Well, I am sure they have their clients and that is great. But when it comes down to it, it costs pennies/gram for a grower to grow, and no matter what price they sell it at they are going to be making money. So sure they have their prices they have to offer, but if a new client in a different area is offering them business where they don&#039;t have it, it is money to be made. And quite frankly, I would grow my own damn tree if I had the space but I figure I can get to that in a few years.These are just your basic principles of business and I get that maybe my mindset isn&#039;t the same as many on here but that&#039;s just how it is and instead of another remark where you try and make this post seem senseless, lets just agree to disagree and call it a day. <br />
