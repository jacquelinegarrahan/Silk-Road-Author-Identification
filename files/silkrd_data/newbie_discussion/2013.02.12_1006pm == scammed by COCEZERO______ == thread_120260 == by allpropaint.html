				HELLO EVERYONE.....<br /><br />TIME TO VENT......<br /><br />WELL.... I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH COCEZERO SINCE JANUARY 18. THIS VENDOR HAS AROUND 90 ORDERS AND MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITHOUT ISSUES.&nbsp; COURSE THEY ARE THE SMALL ORDERS. I ORDERED THE QP LISTING, COST ME OVER $700.00 AND I GET SCAMMED.&nbsp; FOUR DAYS AGO I WAS PROMISED REFUND FROM COCEZERO AND STILL NOTHING.<br />I MESSAGED SR SUPPORT AND OF COURSE THEY GAVE ME THE SPILL ABOUT FINALIZING EARLY. IF THAT IS HOW MOST PEOPLE GET SCAMMED ON SR. WHY DOES SR STAFF ALLOW VENDORS TO ASK FOR A FE???? ALL VENDORS WHO PLAY THIS FE GAME SHOULD BE BANNED!!! NO QUESTIONS..... I AM GOING THROUGH ALL THE VENDORS PAGES I CAN AND THOSE THAT ASK FOR FE I AM REPORTING THEM TO SR SUPPORT.<br />I MEAN.... IVE LOOKED INTO BECOMING A SELLER ON SR MYSELF. I KNOW SR TEAM ASK FOR A BOND (AROUND $500.00) BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BECOMING A SELLER! WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BOND IF THE BUYERS ARE NOT PROTECTED. SR TEAM STILL MAKES THEIR COMMISSIONS ON FE ORDERS, I AM SURE.<br />NOT ONLY DOES THIS GIVE SR A BAD NAME BUT THIS COST SR ALOT OF MONEY AND TIME DEALING WITH THESE SCAMMERS. WHEN I MESSAGED SR SUPPORT THEY SAID THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE AND IF THEY CAN PROVE HE HAS BEEN SCAMMING THEN COCEZERO WOULD BE BANNED, BUT DOES THAT MEAN IF HE GETS BANNED I STILL GET NO REFUND? SOUNDS LIKE ITS ALL A SCAM.....<br />&nbsp;THIS WHOLE ORDEAL HAS LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH AND I AM SPREADING THE WORD ABOUT FE AND HOW THE SCAM WORKS BOTH WITH VENDORS AND SR TEAM. I HOPE I AM JUST BEING INPATIENT AND I WILL GET MY ORDER OR A REFUND FROM COCEZERO.....................................

				Caps lock bro.<br /><br />Nobody put a gun to your head and made you FE.&nbsp; Sorry to be a dick, but it&#039;s really hard to have sympathy for making such an obvious mistake.&nbsp; There are plenty of vendors on here who don&#039;t require it, give them your business instead.

				How does someone even take themselves seriously with an amount of capitalized letters like that? I usually feel silly if i put more than one exclamation mark at the end of a sentence in a computer game.<br /><br />Sorry, but I was really interested in reading about your experience, but I just cannot read that post.

				Never finalize early.<br /><br />The thing you do have to worry about is auto-finalizing which is common if the provider takes a couple days to ship an item out and it has to come from overseas.

				I&#039;ve been going back and forth (mostly forth, much less back involved) with this guy about a single gram of wax for over a month now. I ordered with him specifically because he had a gram I could grab with the leftover btc I had after a shopping spree, and upon checkout I came to realize that BTC had devalued enough during the 2 hours I&#039;d been browsing, and now I was some small amount short - to the point that I had to change my plans. Just so happens our friend in question had an option for free shipping with FE. Now I&#039;m no fool. I DO NOT FE. Ever. Well...up to that night anyhow. I am vehemently opposed to it, refuse to do it, and regularly tell others to avoid it at all costs. Its generally easy to avoid, but this was the wee hours of morning, I was not thinking clearly, and decided to risk it. Whats 40 bucks anyway. If he screws me, I paid $40 to learn who not to deal with. That&#039;s a decent price for a gram or valuable info either way. <br /><br />He contacts me quickly, says to FE and he&#039;ll get it out to me. I do so, and begin waiting. Much to my dismay (but I can&#039;t say I was particularly surprised) he took all of his listings down and went on some two week hiatus for what he said were security/retooling reasons.<br />Awesome. <br /><br />those weeks went by and he came back. Some disgruntled paragraph about how busy he is, and how he has no time for pgp and tough shit basically - a few hostile/transparently BS msg&#039;s later and I finally ask him in no uncertain terms basically&nbsp; WHAT IS UP? <br />he responds by asking me if he shipped or cancelled it before his hiatus, I say he told me he shipped and we clearly had a transaction because I still have the feedback box sitting on my orders screen waiting to be filled out. I can&#039;t stand all the &quot;FE - Will Update&quot; feedback.<br />He says he will check on it. 5 days later i ask him whats the score. He acts as if we&#039;ve never spoken before. Asks for the zip code so he can check the tracking. This is like a month into it. I know theres no tracking but whatever, I send him my zip. no response. a week later I ask again whats up. He says he has no idea, but offers a reship or a refund. I sent him my address again (at least he didn&#039;t still have it) and that was about a week ago again. He hasn&#039;t even read the msg. Now its fairly obvious to me that i&#039;m getting nothing. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m particularly pleased with him knowing my address, but then again I&#039;m moving out of state in a week. He can have it. I don&#039;t know quite what to think, but none of it is good.&nbsp; &nbsp; all in all, not impressed.&nbsp; been holding my tongue and crossing my fingers until now, but this is just retarded. the people need to know. <br /><br />Clearly its my fault for FEing. I know that, and I don&#039;t care about the $40. Its principle, and hopefully a warning to anyone that might come across this who is considering dealing w him. The guys no good.
