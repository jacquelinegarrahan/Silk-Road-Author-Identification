				Hello,<br />Before this site I had tried MDMA, Coke and Weed. I&#039;d like to try everything in life once (within reason!) so I&#039;m thinking what should I try next as there is so much choice on Silk Road!<br /><br />Tell me your favourite drugs (apart from the above) and why you recommend I try it :). Would be cool to get a good discussion going, especially as I have to get 50 posts before I can post anywhere else!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />C

				Psychedelics are not for the faint of heart. I usually see them as a catalyst, something that works with whatever is already in your own mind. With drugs like MDMA and coke, youre pretty much guaranteed a good time wherever you are .. unless youre overdosing or some such other extreme nastiness..<br /><br />Psychedelics will almost always amplify your own inner self and expose your ego raw, pulling you apart and handing you your arse as you fumble about the inner workings of your mind. Start off slow and low dose, you can always add more but you cant take it out once its in your system!<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend harder psychedelics like DMT or high-dose shrooms unless you have a fairly good mental constitution and do not suffer from any mental illnesses. Some people have bad trips but you know, they can be a learning experience too.<br /><br />Set and setting are paramount. Go to lengths to ensure you have a good headspace and external environment; ie. music you enjoy, dim ambient lighting, good friends you trust who are on the same drugs and dosage.. it always helps to have a tripping partner who you can bounce ideas off and who you arent afraid to get a bit messy around.&nbsp; In a comfortable environment man, you can have so much fun with these drugs! Creativity is off the dial, embrace the random, commune with nature, get in touch with yourself and free your mind from daily constraints.<br /><br />They can open your mind and your soul to the unique, the weird, the sideways and the strange.&nbsp; I fucken love psychedelics and in particular, I love DMT. That is another topic in itself though..<br /><br />Theres plenty of reading material out there in the clearnet, I read alot about this stuff because theres alot of questions yet to be answered.. its an exciting place to be; on the frontier of psychedelic experience.. but, thats just me..<br /><br />Carve your own path man but remember, we cant do this alone :)<br /><br />Peace,<br />Diddle.

				for the psychonaut: <br />definitely shrooms, cooked ganja or hash (kind of the stuff they make in India and call &quot;bhang&quot; - not to be underestimated this can last for days if cooked well!), LSD, DMT, mescaline (one of my favorites but very hard to find in decent quality).<br />all of this accompanied by chantings, drums, didgeridoo, ... whatever makes you feel relax, safe and whole as a person...<br /><br />for the addict: it doesn&#039;t matter, everything can get you fucked up especially ice, crack, H, angeldust, speed....<br /><br />for the ones who are willing to do the effort; try meditation (recommended at heavy doses - at least twice a day - for long term usage, minimum 6 months). not only is it the cheapest high, but it also brings your mind in a certain state so that you can actually get a lot more out of your experiences (this comment is meant for the psychonaut, not for the addict). I&#039;d recommend transcendental meditation (TM or MT depending on the language), it totally changed my drug-related experiences and honestly I can&#039;t understand how I was able to enjoy those products before practicing TM... but Hell, as far as I know I wasn&#039;t really enjoying it anyway, I just got wasted and that was the bliss, without understanding anything.&nbsp;

				If you are interested/curious about psychedelics I recommend shrooms! However, you should make sure you are with people you like and trust for your first trip. And go into it remembering that you are still in control and think happy thoughts!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The first drug I&#039;ve ever tried was adderall. That was 6 years ago. My favorite types of drugs are stimulants, but I know many people who aren&#039;t stim fans and love the occasional speed fix.<br /><br />Benzos are nice too!

				Some mention benzos, but really be careful people don&#039;t appreciate the habit forming and addiction potential of these over prescribed but much loved by me drugs.&nbsp; They sneak up on you.&nbsp; Then you don&#039;t want to stop cold turkey but do a long taper if you&#039;ve been on 10mg znzx a day for a year, not cool.<br /><br />Now the psychedelics are all great like most everything in moderation, they can really teach and help tou grow spiritually but just titrate up rater than jump in too deep at first.&nbsp; Start small and work up to your threshold.

				It seems to differ from every individual, you just have to see what seems to work for you... For instance, you see people talkn about all kinda of things, and for me, if its a pill I dont like it, recently took 4 somas, an oc, and even had extacy several times with nearly no effects. I&#039;ve smoked some weird ass shit on foil that i believe to be heroin, and ive smoked crack. I feel like I may be blessed in this sense, but all I really care about is marijuanna! Psychedelics are awesome too :D Benzos or &quot;perscription&quot; pills are scary... I take levothyroxine and allegra :P

				Psychedelics are my personal favorite. I was kind of anxious going into my first ever trip (shrooms), having no clue what was going to happen. I&#039;ve always heard about what it&#039;s like to trip, but until you experience it yourself you really have no idea. The small amount of fear I had soon faded as I realized how amazing the experience can be.<br /><br />I&#039;d say shrooms will be easier to handle than acid for your first trip, especially since you can more accurately measure out the dose yourself. Shrooms and acid both vary in potency, but at least you know shrooms are relatively close to the same almost every time. To be honest, knowing what I do now I&#039;d say 2C&#039;s would be a really good introduction to psychedelics for someone who has no experience with them, specifically 2C-B. Great body high, awesome visuals but nothing too intense, and it doesn&#039;t have as much potential to screw with your head like tryptamines do. If 2C-B just isn&#039;t quite your thing but didn&#039;t scare the shit out of you, go for some shrooms or acid. Everyone is different, and there&#039;s plenty of people who hate 2C&#039;s with a passion but LOVE shrooms or acid.<br /><br />If you do like, good! After trying it some more and becoming familiar with the whole tripping thing, MOVE ON TO DMT!!! I cannot recommend this enough, it&#039;s ridiculously intense but the most beautiful thing you will ever experience in your life, as long as you can handle it.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />On a side note, ketamine is pretty amazing too. And is less likely to scare the shit out of you as long as you don&#039;t k-hole your first time. Almost everyone loves it!

				Hey, in my humble opinion, a small dose of shrooms (1g dry 10g fresh) is a great way to introduce oneself to psychedelics. After that, maybe 100ug of LSD would be easier to handle; I know it can be a bit overwhelming the first time. Also, the nbome line of RCs can provide some fun, although not too deep or spiritual experiences.<br />Just my 2 cents,<br />- JH
