				i&#039;m literally .007 btc away from being able to place a crucial order and was wondering if any of you wonderfully charitable gentlemen and ladies might be willing to donate a dollar to the cause. my buyer account name is the same as this one (spiderjslym) so you can see i&#039;m a solid member of the community and i&#039;ll definitely be paying the karmic favor forward the first chance i get.<br /><br />sorry if this is against the rules mods, just had to try.

I won&#039;t be paying this forward...as I don&#039;t believe in karma and I just said that to sound good. So open up your btc accounts and give me a god dam dollar!!

				well, yes. i am definitely a bum, and you&#039;re right, i don&#039;t really believe in karma, but i do believe in doing good deeds and committing such small acts of charity such as hooking up a dollar to a fellow chemical enthusiast is personally rewarding. i understand your hostility, begging is pretty pathetic, but i&#039;m kind of in a bind and thought i might as well try. i certainly won&#039;t be taking any donations beyond the .007 i need to place my order.

				Damn you, King. I was going to be the charitable one. XD <br /><br />I was short 0.09 last week for a package. Really sucks, especially if you are using something like BitInstant which rapes you on fees. Glad you got your BTC. Happy shopping.

				if you don&#039;t try you don&#039;t get. It is a BIG ask. 0.09 short.<br />Maybe 9 people could give me 0.01.<br />But then, why should you - I have absolutely no fucking idea and if someone does it will be the weirdest shit ever to happen on a site that seems to the rest of the world to be full of criminals who are destroying society.<br />Oh - if you wonder what I want it for, it&#039;s for diazepam for my dying cat - or more likely to help me with my drug induced paranoias and come downs.<br />peace.<br /><br />p.s. my real SR acc name is mdmamazing99 - that&#039;s where the money goes - pop goes the weasel!
