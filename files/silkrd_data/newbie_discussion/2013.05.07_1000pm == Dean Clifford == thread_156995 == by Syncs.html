				Dean Clifford - Making it Simple<br />CLEARNET WARNING https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK6matfk0jc CLEARNET WARNING (you can just search video name on the net)<br />I was wondering if someone has looked into this stuff. Basically he says that governments statutes (the things you all call law) don&#039;t apply to him, because he is not working for government and natural law and human rights trumps all governments BS also in court when they try to come after you. Kind off makes sense. Especially as he has gotten free from his latest trouble where they tried to make an example of off him by trying to charge him with 10+ different things and eventually dropping all. Now he is preparing law suits against all who have been involved taking his rights. Any thoughts?

				So I think it&#039;s a valid idea, even though a radical departure from our current state of affairs.&nbsp; There does seem to be a problem though, with the last sentence.&nbsp; What kind of lawsuit can be brought on behalf of someone who doesn&#039;t believe that governments have a right to exist?&nbsp; If his original statement stands, that is, human rights trump government, then what kind of &quot;court&quot; is there to bring lawsuits through?&nbsp; If we are really sovereign, each of us, then we decide things for ourselves, and each problem is tried by the court of me-and-you, where we, if we believe in human rights, keep talking, keep working, till a solution is found.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Basically he says there are different types of jurisdictions, they will try to trick you into believing you are in a real court when you are really just answering for braking government created rules. As I understand for example US government isn&#039;t really a real government but a corporation. When you haven&#039;t harmed anyone with your actions, then they will try to get you with the governments regulation. But these are not real courts and these are not real laws, they can apply only to government employees. This is the part where your birth certificate comes in. If I understand correctly your parents basically sign you into slavery with this document. I don&#039;t have all this down yet, so who is really interested in this stuff should listen to him, I might get some things wrong. But coming back to your point, it seems there are legitimate court systems where you can go, if someone has done you harm.
