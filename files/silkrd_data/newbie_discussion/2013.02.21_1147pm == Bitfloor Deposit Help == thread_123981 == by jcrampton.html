				Hi all. I&#039;ve been browsing SR for awhile now and am trying to join in the fun now. Can anyone help me with the Bitfloor.com Bank of America deposit. I got to the point on BF where I&#039;m supposed to go to Bank of America and make the deposit. I have an Account name (LocalTill, LLC), and an Account Number. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen this info before if you&#039;ve done it. I just need help with the part of process when I go to the bank. Is it just a direct checking deposit with cash (one of those slips they have)? What do I put for &quot;Name&quot; and what do I sign? Will they ask for photo ID? Thanks in advance for reading!<br /><br />-jcrampton

				Regular deposit slip&gt;&gt;&gt;Fill it out &gt;&gt;&gt;LocalTill,LLC ///Account #. Give them the deposit slip and the cash and then your good. No ID was asked for.<br /><br />I was using Bitinstant before things got a little funky with them. Read around the forum and learned about &quot;Bitfloor.com&quot;. <br />Opened a an acount using only an e-mail address. Deposit money in Bank of America. Money goes into your account1,2,3.<br />Then you have to trade (purchase) to get BTCs ,either by Market order or limit order. Market order,the transaction is quicker in terms of the actually purchase but the minimum amount is 5BTC at a time. Limit order you can trade for any amount(1,2,3,4etc.),but it takes 24hrs and you get a better rate of exchange. Hope this helps.<br />MarcoRuas(king of the streets) 8)

Any help with this?

				I don&#039;t think it matters which location as long as it&#039;s a BOA. They handle the LocalTill,LLC account. Try it. worst thing that could happen is that they don&#039;t accept the deposit,which I doubt. Hope this helps<br />MarcoRuas(king of the streets)

				If I am understanding things correctly, bitfloor only charges .4% to purchase bitcoins.&nbsp; This is much better than the old bitinstant method that charged 4% plus the 3.95 moneygram.

				How do you get your bitcoins from bitfloor to SR though? This is the only problem I&#039;m really having right now.

There you will find your SR bitcoin wallet address. Copy this address ,then go back to Bitfloor,click on the withdraw link at the top , and paste it to the out going wallet address. There is also a space asking how many BTCs you want to transfer. It takes a little time for the transfer to happen, so be impatient. Hope this helps<br />Marco Ruas(king of the streets)

				TIP: Specifically ask for an &quot;out of state&quot; deposit slip if you are not depositing into an NY branch. This is the only bank I have seen use this but it exists....

				@wwwrothy I think the whole trade process only took 20-30 minutes total, I&#039;ve only done it twice now but seems to be fairly quick.<br /><br />Good Luck!
