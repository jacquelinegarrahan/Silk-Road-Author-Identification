				Hi everyone, I am thinking about the future of SilkRoad and how far it into the future it will be viable. I realize that as of now it&#039;s almost impossible for the governments to crack down on anyone on SilkRoad right now, unless they do something stupid like that one seller that got caught recently. But I doubt SilkRoad&#039;s viability into the coming decades, to a century. Like once computing power is greatly increased would they be able to decrypt SilkRoad&#039;s internet traffic. I am thinking way ahead here, but it just seems like every other group selling illegal things have always gotten caught in the past. Not everyone in that group but still. Like one of the major leaders in a big Mexican drug gang recently got caught. I know SilkRoad is doing good now in protecting it&#039;s sellers. But the future for me is questionable.<br /><br />Can anyone here with a real sense of how this technology works reply please?<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks, peace.

				Eventually they are going to shut down the tor network which won&#039;t be hard for them to do, then bye bye Silk Road.<br />I see it lasting 10-15 years max. The USA will be a third world country by then.

				I hope we see an end to the sort of centralization that SR represents, a single site dominating this brave new world is not a good idea. In my ideal world we&#039;d have every vendor having their own shop on a decentralized market where communication is routed through trusted friends to reach the destination, sort of how RetroShare does it.<br /><br />This would be better than SR because there would be a market of index sites, escrow agents and trust networks, it would be far more resilient to attack than one single site that could be closed down for whatever reason. I hope we see something like this within the next 5 years, the technology is available today anyway.<br /><br />Trying to guess where we&#039;ll be in 50 years is impossible though, 50 years ago it was the 70s and technology moves much faster nowadays.

It is not so easy to restrict such on the basis of them being legal.&nbsp; <br />--It is decentralized; Napster etc was not, which is why it was shut down so easily<br /><br />I think places like the road will be here for quite sometime.&nbsp; However, I do see them scaring the shit out of exit node providers in desperation, something that&#039;s already started

				Well, 50-100 yrs is pure hope. Will probably last 5-10 years before either economy for coders blow up and site/tor has to close down due to financial problems. OR, some sort of government taking it down.
