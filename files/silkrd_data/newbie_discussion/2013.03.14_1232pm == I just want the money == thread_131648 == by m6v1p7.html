				Hard work pays off is the term that we have all come to love. So what happens when it dosen&#039;t?<br />Well here I am on the forum hoping to get through this 50 posts to overcome the n00b obstacle. I&#039;ve done nothing but work hard and study through life trying to gain the appreciation of the people that surround me. All I have ever strived for is to make money, and lots of it. I&#039;ve worked too hard not to live the life I want. As I know from past posts that Im sure there will be a smartass on here that says don&#039;t we all. Well, the thing is a lot of the people on here are &quot;most likely&quot; rich kids that feel this same way- but are ignorant to the opportunity and love that surround them. <br />And then there will be those who say money isnt everything and money isnt this...<br />well I am proud to say I know this, and i value every friendship i have and would never let anything come between this. Money is more/lless a perk of life that helps maintain healthy emotions and mindset. I obviously get happy knowing and feeling the love my family has to offer me but that moment when a payment is recieved and you know you can buy your wife/ kids something or buy that something you&#039;ve wanted for the past month. So yes, I thoroughly enjoy the money and just don&#039;t make enough to say the least.<br />But from here there is only one direction and Im just going to do what it takes
