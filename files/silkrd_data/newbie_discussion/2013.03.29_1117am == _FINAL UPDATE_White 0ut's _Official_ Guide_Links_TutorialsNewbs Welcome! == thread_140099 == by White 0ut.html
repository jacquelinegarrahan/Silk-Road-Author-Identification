				MESSAGE:<br /><br />&nbsp;This thread is growing into what I imagined! Everyone is starting to pitch in their tutorials and what not! I love it! Please try to skim over the whole thread, the OP is just a small portion of the information in this thread! Lots of contributions from others as well! There is information on nearly every page!<br /><br />Feel free to ask questions as my answers will just be adding on to the surplus of information! Other members if you have any valuable information throw it in here for the newbs &amp; vets alike!<br /><br />This thread is not stickied, so if you learn even on bit of information all I ask is you bump it to show the next person the love!<br /><br />-W0<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I&#039;m going to get right to the point NEVER FUCKING FINALIZE EARLY NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!<br /><br />Now that I have your attention, I am going to take some time to break down a very detailed guide on how every aspect of SR should work for all you n00bs so we can start filling your threads with useful questions. This is a work in progress so please bare with me all, I can&#039;t have it all typed tonight. I am however going to start taking daily notes and storing them here for future n00bs!<br /><br />&nbsp;I figure if we are going to have to coexisist with the newbs I might as well take it upon myself to inform them or at the very least give them an idea of what to do once they touch base here.<br /><br />I will try to answer as many *sensible questions as possible! PM me even if you need to. <br /><br />Well here it goes....<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;Some Quick Reminders For The Uneducated SR&#039;er off the bat!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Lately IRL (in real life) I have been running across a variety of people, most young &amp; newbs ,&nbsp; but some old...that use SilkRoad &amp; actually inquire about it.. <br /><br />I don&#039;t bring it up and I play fool to everything, but it is just odd to me, especially considering most of these people are below average IQ, and personally I would have taken them for being technologically illiterate.<br /><br />Just random people I might happen to deal with business wise or rather when&nbsp; someone has the rare chance to see my variety of goodies that would otherwise be unheard of.<br /><br />The first thing these people have asked when they saw or had my shit described to them-----<br /><br />&quot;Did you get that off of the Silk Road :o&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s that? ;D&quot;<br /><br />That should be your answer as well people. Here is a quick list why you shouldn&#039;t brag or even admit to knowing what Silk Road is.<br /><br />-The more publicity SR gains, the more chance it has of being shut down. This is why reddit articles can be so detrimental.<br />-If people find out via you then it takes away from your business.<br />-Just share your drugs with your close friends but never give in &amp; tell how you got them. Your true friends won&#039;t keep asking.<br />-We don&#039;t need 18&lt; or really even 21&lt; here, despite some exceptions, most people of this age have not had computer education advanced enough to be able to comprehend most of this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well at least not enough to do it safely.<br />-It could lead to thieves invading your home for your goods.<br />-It could bring the heat of LE (law enforcement) if one of your idiot acquaintance uses you as a scape goat, which they will. Bet on it.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is a severe n00b dedicated section that touches on how to handle being compromised by law enforcement if you have ordered to soon and didn&#039;t know your shit.<br />&nbsp;Remember these guidelines and you should be considerably safe for now.<br /><br />-The second most important rule besides NEVER FUCKING FINALIZING EARLY, is NEVER FUCKING TALK TO A COP....<br />-No matter if they have you DEAD TO RIGHTS smoking a L, laying blotters, while sitting on 100k$ in laundered money.... NEVER TALK. You have the right to remain silent, this is referring to Americas laws btw. The only thing you should say is contact my lawyer.<br />-They cannot hurt you, but you will be intimidated so much that you will be mentally hurt and ready to crack under pressure.<br />-Mentioning SR will have no affect on the outcome, the vendors are anonymous completely and that&#039;s who they need. You can&#039;t give them that info so don&#039;t even bring the heat over here.<br />- No Drugs inside your home... PERIOD<br />-Never accept or sign for a package that you are not expecting to be required to sign for, this is likely a controlled delivery.<br />-Never open your door to anyone you do not know, they WILL get in your house if you open. <br />-Lock your doors at all times.<br />-Don&#039;t even open for sales reps.<br />-Know your real mailman...(Real one Can still be used in a CD (controlled delivery)<br />-Know your normal drop times &amp; mailmans route.<br />-Be careful when opening packs as they may contain light sensitive ink bombs or electronic bugs. (very rare cases)<br />-Never talk on your cellphone about SR.<br />-Never send SR related pics<br />-Don&#039;t txt about SR<br />-Always have a backup plan.<br />-Always know your surroundings.<br />-Make sure nothing or no one sketchy is following you<br /><br />*Never log onto any social media, school site, ebay ect ect from Tor because where Tor does make you anonymous if you put in your info Law Enforcement can determine what you have entered...<br />*Avoid visiting most clearnet sites on Tor.<br />*Always encrypt any sensitive info<br />*Be careful what you post, every word just makes it easier for them to determine that particular user is you if your ever compromised.<br />*If you have already managed to fuck up enough to have LE on your ass, lawyer up and say nothing.<br />*Never sign for a package that you are not aware you should be signing for. This is called a controlled delivery and that mailman is really the DEA.<br />*Try to use someone elses wi-fi to order, not a must but always safer than sorry.<br />*Avoid giving your information to anyone. <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The first thing you want to do once you download the .Tor web browser is go ahead and head on over to both the actual Silk Road site. Now be careful if you already have a login page, be cautious as phishing sites create look a like dummy sites designed to get your information and access your account. The only sure method is to memorize it or save it in an encrypted text file.<br /><br />THIS IS THE ONLY ADDRESS TO WHICH ONE CAN ACCESS THE SILK ROAD MARKETPLACE ALL OTHERS ARE FAKE!<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now that you have your account setup on the road you want to click on the community forums at the bottom which brings you here, also register on this site as well. There is a 50 count post rule for new members, they are limited to only the newb threads as you can see...<br />THIS IS THE ONLY ADDRESS TO WHICH ONE CAN ACCESS THE SILK ROAD COMMUNITY FORUMS ALL OTHERS ARE FAKE!<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now this step is crucial, before you make any purchase on Silk Road. I would recommend spending at least two weeks or 50 educated post on the forums and then gradually start working your way up... Here is a list of threads that I would personally recommending to all n00bs for their first reads!<br />------------------------------------------------<br />(Unofficial) SR FAQ- Credit Delta11<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119852.msg812683#msg812683<br /><br />The Complete All-in-One Guide on How to Anonymously Use Silk Road- Credit John Keats<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />Are you Paralyzed by PGP?

Thanks ( Just some good info in here from older members about keeping your hardware safe from feds.)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=122443.0;topicseen<br /><br />Topic: Ask me anything - The sensible discussion thread!- Credit PrincessHIGH (Good info in here!)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119840.0;topicseen<br /><br />All of these amongst many others are all great reads...<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />*BEGINNER TIP*: Lotteries are a nice way to raise your transactions and purchase history, some lotteries are rather expensive and can pad your account early on, as well as possibly winning something nice! <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ALL ABOUT BITCOINS<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Let&#039;s not put our cart in front of our horse though, we still have to understand and grasp this whole Bitcoin matrix. I&#039;ll see if I can help break it down...<br /><br />A Bitcoin is a virtual currency system that is currently used by thousands of online vendors and is slowly developing into being one of the largest currency&#039;s in the world to date.<br /><br />The reason that these bitcoins are so valueable to us on SR is the fact that they can be anonymously exchanged through Bitcoin wallets, this is where your unique Silk Road address is derived from. This can be thought of as something to hold your bitcoins.<br /><br />So what makes them so special is that we can freely exchange them for goods due to the fact that they are put through so many different address&#039;s and washes in the SilkRoad network. That is the only easiest way I know to explain at the moment. Maybe if another memeber would like to pitch in some info...<br /><br />Now we are going to need to find a way to obtain these said Bicoins in a way that keeps us anonymous as due to the nature of our business. <br /><br />So how would one do that you might ask?<br /><br />Simple, use one of the following sites to arrange a cash deposit at a location arranged by you and the provider. <br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />BitInstant- https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Or you can use<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bitfloor- https://bitfloor.com/<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Both are awesome, Featuring deposit and withdrawals from places like bank of America, Walmart, CVS, Albertsons. All can be depostited to MTGOX <br />which can be used to exchange USD for Bitcoins! Woohoo!<br />Make sure when you go to make your deposit your money to use out of state slip for Bank of America or Fake information at Walmart, they don&#039;t ID.<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />MTGOX BITCOIN EXCHANGE- https://mtgox.com/<br /><br />*NEWBIE TIP: MTGOX can be used to check the current going rate for BTC much like the stock market!<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now just follow the instructions at MTGOX and get those BTC over to your SR address!<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />So when do I get to order and how?<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />So now that we have our bitcoins we get to have some fun, Fuck yes...<br />The forums are always your best friend when shopping on SR, every vendor has feedback on their page. But only a short amount. Come to the fourms and run a quick search to see what the vendor is really about. <br /><br />Take into consideration things like Stealth, Communication, Product Quality, and Customer Service if something does happen to go wrong. <br /><br />Here are some great threads to get started educating yourself on the vendors with!!! But the best info can be found in a vendors particular review thread which can be found on their profile!<br /><br />Cannabis- <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10062.msg904103#msg904103<br /><br />Coke-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.0;topicseen<br /><br />LSD- <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0 <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94182.msg916727#msg916727<br /><br />MDMA-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1006.msg949402#msg949402<br /><br />DMT-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0<br /><br />Meth-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.0;topicseen<br /><br />Heroin-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2484.msg940734#msg940734<br /><br />Speed-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4750.4695;topicseen<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Things on a need to know basis for every SilkRoad user...<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here are a list of things you will need to know how to use and get very familiar with, a quick forum or google search will explain each one!<br /><br />DPR (DreadPirateRoberts) our messiah, our savior, nah not really but he is a spectacular fellow that has managed to improve everyone&#039;s life on the road &amp; made all of this possible.....

				OP UPDATED<br />*added some quick tips for the newest of users!<br />*also added my vendor recommendation list!<br /><br />Thanks Scout, KandyKidd, <br />&amp;<br />congrats Verdande way to not be a n00b, you actually read it! Nice, now implement it!<br /><br />****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />CONTINUANCE OF ORIGINAL POST! UPDATED 04/03/13<br />*****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Notes of the Day Section!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />03/29/13<br />Note Of the Day<br />*Seen a disturbing thread about some things I would rather not discuss, anyway by accident or misend or something somehow someone aquired someone elses personal infor such as their name, city, state everything all from a phone number being exchanged... Now they are somehow getting blackmailed for money. Realize the there are a type of people that are roaming these forums are not all good people like most of us are.... Just be safe and never give away your details unless it is through a verified vendor and even then PGP your shit!<br /><br />03/30/13 <br />Note of the Day<br />* I have noticed seeing a lot of people complaining about not receiving their international orders in only 13&lt; days. I just think as a n00b you need to know that some of these orders can be very delayed by customs and the USPS. Also on that note, get to know your mailman. For instance with me I caught mine at our dropoff spot one time while he was delivering. Without disclosing to much info I let him know in a indirect way by talking loudly to someone else that I had recently gone crazy eBay&#039;ing all kinds of shit. Now he knows the reason for all the packs...&nbsp; Also it is not a bad idea to know his normal routine/time/appearance. Of course this may change for sick days.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />****Also another not for this beautful Easter morning,<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />WHEN TO REPORT A POST<br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp;I just stumbled into a thread and read this upon disbelief.*****<br /><br />Please report this behavior immediately.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m offering bitcoins for tips that lead to silk road related arrests of importing controlled substances into the United States.&quot;<br /><br />PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD REPORT THIS KIND OF SHIT!!!! Use your report button people, and leave a detailed message why. If enough come in we can weed out this shit. SR is understaffed so lets pitch in that 2min extra.... Even if it&#039;s a troll and not LE it&#039;s not to be tolerated.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />How the ordering process works &amp; why it is safe for you as a customer...<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATED* 03/31/13<br /><br />You are probably torn at this point between ordering non-domestic or domestic... This all depends on what drug but usually is the same for each...<br /><br />Domestic Order Pros<br />-Faster Shipping Time<br />-Cheaper Shipping<br />-Less Time that you pack has to possibly be caught in transfer<br />-Generally better customer service<br />-Doesn&#039;t have to pass international customs<br /><br />Domestic Cons<br />-More expensive generally...<br />-Limited Selection<br /><br />Non-Domestic Pros<br />-Cheaper Product<br />-Better Quality, this generally applies to anything white... Not always the case though.<br />-Better Selection<br /><br />Non Domestic Cons<br />-More Suspicious<br />-Must pass through international customs<br />-A whole new ballfield of charges if compromised!<br />-Longer wait times, a lot longer<br />-Generally has more delays<br />-Lack of english speaking in customer service<br /><br />Please note this is not always the case with domestic and non domestic as it is subject to change with any order and any vendor.<br /><br />Now that you have found your selected product you want to go ahead and contact the vendor and see what their policies are with new SR members, many don&#039;t care but some may ask you to finalize early... DONT FUCKING FINALIZE EARLY<br /><br />Just forget about what you wanted and find another vendor that can relate more to you as a customer.<br /><br />Once you get into contact and confirm that it is ok to place an order place it!<br /><br />Select the item, put it in your cart and check out. Don&#039;t forget to get the vendors PGP key and PGP encrypt your address!<br /><br />Always make sure to check your shit X5 make sure the address is in this format... This makes it easiest for the vendor.<br /><br />BOB MARLEY<br />420 STONER STREET #88<br />=DENVER, COLORADO<br />80127<br />UNITED STATES (Only for non-domestic)<br /><br />*NEWBIE TIP: I like to use a different address as my own. Simply because I enjoy cannabis in my home. Either way rule #2 besides NEVER FUCKING FINALIZING EARLY is don&#039;t keep drugs, anything, or anyone illegal in the home you are shipping your shit to. This is for obvious reasons.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />So what happens if I don&#039;t receive my package?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Here is where it starts to get tricky. <br /><br />Past the 12-15 day mark for domestic orders you should have already been in contact with the seller and ready to come upon a neutral resolution. Before the 17 days is up you will need to file a resolution, it will then be in the hands of the SR staff. If you don&#039;t file a resolution however it will auto-finalize and then you will be unable to receive any kind of refund.<br /><br />For non domestic I recommend giving them more time in the resolution center as sometimes international times can be malarkey.<br /><br />Once in the resolution center you will inform the staff on what type of refund you want. A certain % of refund, or a reship of your item. <br /><br />I would also recommend always reshipping to a different address. Your package may have gotten lost. It also may have been seized and your address flagged.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

				Great post! This should be stickied if you ask me. <br /><br />Quick tip- If you use instawallet, for the love of god, save the URL!! And make sure you type everything in correctly before having a heart attack. I had a minor freak out when one of my l&#039;s turned out to be a capital i. The font at the time made them look nearly identical. Luckily since I had the wallet address saved someone from the site figured it out for me. So you might want to hang on to that as well just in case.

				++++++++++<br />Vendor Testing +<br />++++++++++<br /><br />Fake addresses for free samples. This is a precaution for all NEW VENDORS. We don&#039;t want LE screening our shit, so we give them shit right back. Free samples? That means it&#039;s a very inexpensive method for screening for LE.

				Just give out free samples to established buyers with epic stats, weeds out LE at least making cheap attempts.

Getting started here was a fucking hassle and I made over 50 purchases in my first month on the road to find out which vendors are worth dealing with and which ones are a waste of my time. I understand not everyone can do that so I&#039;d be happy to offer my advice.<br /><br />So, if its comes to anything Marijuana related, I probably know the best on the road and you&#039;re free to ask me for opinions.

I remember when I was a newb how I would think about how special of a person it takes to be a true leader and someone people can look to in this community. I mean if you can earn respect here, then that is truly saying something.<br /><br />I look to you people with such respect because of the amount of people that are NOT willing to step up and fill the shoes of what is &quot;constructive leadership&quot; here. You guys are our constructive leaders and without you all I, we, the whole community would be lost. <br /><br />I&#039;ll personally do my best to try and maintain what order I can, I just want everyone to have a fair chance here. I mean I just can&#039;t stand to see all these horrid questions being asked and not help but think, &quot;If this poor mother doesn&#039;t even know this, he is going to get busted or scammed so hard by the time he is done.&quot; I can&#039;t stand that thought.<br /><br />You know why, cause that was me, I was in those damn shoes and let me tell you they SUCK!<br /><br />No one should have to come into this community as uninformed as most of us were to start. <br /><br />There are so many fuck off threads on the refresh now none of the newbs can educate themselves properly, but instead be fed a bunch of spam and senseless questions about certain drugs and effects that have been answered 50x over on these forums. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why we don&#039;t sticky more threads. They need more guidance than what they receive. <br /><br />I am not hinting at my own because it is nowhere near deserving, I am talking about some of the others. <br /><br />&amp; I hate to put it like this but frankly for every newb that gets caught or scammed over it is actually bad for all of us... <br /><br />With every new SR related bust we just all get a little more paranoid and rightfully so, because with every new bust LE finds out one more little puzzle piece to shutting us down. One way or another... <br /><br />Everytime someone gets scammed, it just makes us all a little more paranoid, and rightfully so, because every time someone is scammed it just instills even more the fact that trustworthiness is not among us. <br /><br />Thanks for everything nomad! A true hero.

				So I have read through quite a few guides now but I am still uncertain about one thing.<br /><br />I live in Australia and am keen to attempt some importing from OS for personal use as it is a 1/10th of the local price and likely much better quality. I understand that Aus has very strict and effective customs controls and thus a bad reputation amongst sellers and I am perfectly happy and in fact expect to lose several parcels to customs over time.<br /><br />I also understand and accept that shipping my parcel could take 30+ days and I am prepared to wait patiently.. however my question is....<br /><br />before the 17 day auto finalise timer runs out on my order page should I<br />1. Let the system auto finalise automatically even though I don&#039;t have my stuff.<br />2. FE early to avoid auto finalisation against my account/stats<br />3. Click the resolve button (not sure what happens when this button is pressed I assume there is a message type system) and explain to SR mod that I am not panicked, don&#039;t think the seller if a scammer, and happily prepared to wait x more days - just want to keep the order &quot;open&quot; as such..<br /><br />Being from Aus I am also trying to only buy from sellers that offer tracking with postage as I feel this &quot;protects&quot; me somewhat from selective scammers, and also gives sellers peace of mind that I am not trying to scam them (hard for me to say I never got it when the tracking # said it was delivered successfully), however obviously this is not effective if the sale has already finalised...<br /><br />Any advice, suggestion or feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Simply because I enjoy cannabis in my home. Either way rule #2 besides NEVER FUCKING FINALIZING EARLY is don&#039;t keep drugs, anything, or anyone illegal in the home you are shipping your shit to. This is for obvious reasons.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First of all thanks for this informative guide.<br /><br />A question regarding the above - I suspect that many of us don&#039;t have the luxury of a 2nd address that we can ship to, and also on a day to day basis there will be times when drugs/drug paraphernalia are in the house. <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of keeping a clean house whenever I see an order marked as shipped from SR and for a time after I take delivery.&nbsp; <br /><br />I realize that this isn&#039;t a perfect solution but given that, how long after a successful delivery has been taken do you think it be necessary to maintain a clean house? Presumably if LE were suspicious they would strike immediately/soon after a delivery?&nbsp; My SR orders are only for relatively small. personal amounts. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />@Kinetic<br />I think you have a good idea of what I am talking about. The method you mentioned above should be fine. When I was shipping to my actual address I will admit that I kept a little Chillum (pipe) and a small amount of bud around. I always had it in a place hidden, where I could always make it there before cops so I could toss/flush the buds &amp; I tried to keep my chillum always clean. You should be fine mate...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140099.msg963545#msg963545">Quote from: ChemBot on April 01, 2013, 11:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I have read through quite a few guides now but I am still uncertain about one thing.<br /><br />I live in Australia and am keen to attempt some importing from OS for personal use as it is a 1/10th of the local price and likely much better quality. I understand that Aus has very strict and effective customs controls and thus a bad reputation amongst sellers and I am perfectly happy and in fact expect to lose several parcels to customs over time.<br /><br />I also understand and accept that shipping my parcel could take 30+ days and I am prepared to wait patiently.. however my question is....<br /><br />before the 17 day auto finalise timer runs out on my order page should I<br />1. Let the system auto finalise automatically even though I don&#039;t have my stuff.<br />2. FE early to avoid auto finalisation against my account/stats<br />3. Click the resolve button (not sure what happens when this button is pressed I assume there is a message type system) and explain to SR mod that I am not panicked, don&#039;t think the seller if a scammer, and happily prepared to wait x more days - just want to keep the order &quot;open&quot; as such..<br /><br />Being from Aus I am also trying to only buy from sellers that offer tracking with postage as I feel this &quot;protects&quot; me somewhat from selective scammers, and also gives sellers peace of mind that I am not trying to scam them (hard for me to say I never got it when the tracking # said it was delivered successfully), however obviously this is not effective if the sale has already finalised...<br /><br />Any advice, suggestion or feedback would be greatly appreciated!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First, never fucking finalize early!<br /><br />Why do you expect &quot;not&quot; to receive your shit? There are plenty of great vendors that can nail Aussie customs to a wall! Just find the right ones.... A lot will want you to FE though. Don&#039;t.... Ever.... Just go into resolution, you can extend the time for the vendor for as long as you need.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				OP UPDATED 04/08/03<br /><br />Not a lot of information added on this time but here is a review for my latest vendor I fux with! Loved it! Also there are some new DMT additions to the trusted vendor list. Welcome RogerPete and elvis. I will have your reviews up as soon as I can break out the volcano! I will be adding a lot more stuff in the coming days so stay tuned!<br /><br />GaiaGarden<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/666fb9fb2d<br /><br />Hey all Im back here with a big&nbsp; ;D on my face to review three of Gaia Garden&#039;s amazing, astounding products! I got a chance to try out two different strains of his famous buds the first was called Alaskan Ice and the next was Prophet. I also was fortunate enough to receive a generous 1.5g sample of his personal recipe earwax! This vendor is very generous and will likely throw in extra with each order judging by his sample generosity.<br /><br />Shipping/Packaging<br />&nbsp;5/5<br />Was on tap with all items arriving in the same pack. All were triple vac sealed if I remember correctly, there was absolutely no smell getting out of this package whatsoever. The buds were not compressed at all and were even labeled nicely! The labeling on the package was professional as well. Speedy time in transit and it got here in only 2 days. This vendors location is handy for shipping to anywhere in the US!<br /><br />Vendor<br />5/5<br />This vendor is a very generous person. I always enjoy the ones the most who don&#039;t care to small talk and address some of your questions. This is that vendor. The other thing I like is that he is always online and very fast to respond to you. I have a feeling that his customer service skills are perfect for vending on SR. Not to mention his prices will KICK ASS! Going to make the market competitive! Awesome communication.<br /><br />ALASKAN ICE!<br />*PIC*<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2m.JPG<br /><br /><br />Well I did some research on this specific strain only to find out great news. One of the highest recorded THC %&#039;s to date! I was stoked going into it. This stone was very mentally challenging but in a good way. I loved how deeply it affected the thought process. Almost a psychoactive experience but not quite that bad. Def in a good way. I would highly recommend this strain for painkilling as I feel that is what it&#039;s best use would be. I would buy a very large amount of this bud because it will last you a good while!<br /><br />It was very sticky and a joy to break up. It also featured a very fresh taste. Its almost as if each hit relieves a little bit more pain with each inhale. One of the biggest comments I had on it was how it literally &quot;brings you to your knees&quot;... Lovely strain!<br /><br />She is very heavy in crystallization like her white widow genetics show. I mean completely covered. Her looks are just as good as her other qualities.<br /><br />THE PROPHET<br />*PIC*<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2y.JPG<br /><br />This will likely go down as one of my top ten strains of all time. I enjoyed looking at/ breaking down / smoking/smelling..... every single thing that was associated with this bud made me fall madly in love with this strain! The strain is derived from pre-&#039;98 bubba &amp; tang tang.<br /><br />The smell is not as musky as the bubba genetics have shown in the past, but rather a kushy citrus aroma.<br /><br />&nbsp;With a background of the Bubba dankness, the flavor is lightened up by the Tang Tang, adding elements of citrus and herbs.&nbsp; The flavor isn’t overwhelmingly strong like a proper Bubba is, but it hands in the mouth in much the same way, reminding the user of the flavor seemingly at random for a while after smoking.<br /><br />The Tang Tang adds a potent package of head effects and seems to step up the overall potency of the Bubba.&nbsp; The Tang Tang phenotypes have a very strong head presence, with a feeling of a boulder rolling around inside the back of the skull at times, as well as quite a bit of eye pressure fluctuation.&nbsp; It has major mood elevating properties as well, finishing cleanly and without any sort of crash — it makes for a versatile medication suitable for day or night use.&nbsp; The Bubba-dominant phenotypes are definitely heavier, and if let go long will pack quite the narcotic punch, aiding sleep and relaxing muscles. I copied some information from the strains generic information. I can assure you though that everything mentioned here is well incorporated into this strain.<br /><br />EARWAX<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/n2c.JPG<br /><br />I was informed by GaiaGarden that I received a sample of some of the last of his personal batch of earwax. He also informed me that this is a very tedious process done by him and he incorporates his own &#039;recipe&#039; when making this wonderful substance. This will soon be featured on his vendor page at a very reasonable price. The tint of this earwax was on point for sure. A very dark tint that was a glazing honey almost.<br /><br />The smell was fantastic. I know concentrates aren&#039;t known for wreaking but this one is pretty fun to stick to the nostril. I dab&#039;d this on my nail&amp;dome rig that is like a bubbler. The substance has no problem at all vaping and is a HITTER..<br /><br />A small dab gives you just enough of a hit that you need not to start dying coughing. Well actually you will cough quite a bit but not much. This earwax is very strong and mult dabs may cause you to sleep. Be careful on the inhale because if you try to go big you will regret it. Keep these dab sizes small because you do not need much and will over do it fast with this particular product. It is a heavy hitter &amp; I would only recommend for the experienced smokers!

				I have always treated SR like Fight Club. I wont say the line. Its a line and SR is for real. I treat SR as if its my own personal secret treasure trove. There isnt anyone I know I would trust (enough) to be as safe (anal) as I am and I dont trust anyone when they are looking into a jail cell. I only trust me. Been there done that and moved on. <br />I share what I get but its always the same answer when they ask: its through a friend (vendor) of a friend (SR). So im not really lying. Its for their own protection in truth. If they were wise enough to find SR they would be wise enough to use it. Let them stick to Youtube and Facebook. <br />I use TOR for Tails on a USB drive which I keep in a false panel in the wall. I take it out when I need to use it and put it back when im done. I have a dedicated laptop JUST for &quot;questionable&quot; research and buying Bitcoins and for using my TOR with. Things of that nature. I have gone to extreme extents to memorize all my user information except my wallet address but I can get that here and I dont maintain a balance anywhere else. There is an apartment complex behind me that I can get on the one secure wi-fi connection. Its secure and the owner does not know me. <br />These are just a few of the steps I take that I thought I would mention in addition to all the great advice listed here. I am probably overkill but I sleep really good at night.

				Im always learning better ways to stay safe and I was thinking about it and if any newbies are interested in learning how to get off your own wifi connection and get on someone elses its something I can show you. If after you have access to what you want if you felt it was worth it maybe I could make a little BTC? Im not asking for anything up front and there will be those that want to try to scam me and it wont be anyone elses problem but my own. I accept that and im ok with it. This is just an idea. Maybe no one is interested. If you are PM me and we can talk about it. Its not hard.

				White out I wish everyone would write their feedback with such detail. This is what we all need to do. <br /><br />Having us newbies post to 50 before allowing us to post in the main forum is meant to give us time to ask those questions that everyone asks but gets tired of hearing in the main forum. Like how to I get BTC into my SR account, etc. Alot of people want to just post spam to 50 then when they do have a question they have a hard time getting it answered in the main forum. I just saw a jr member asking what PGP was for.<br /><br />The newbie forum is here for us to get these basics down not post 50 spam or other mindless topics. This also gives us newbies a background or history here so to speak. Other members can go and see our posts and get a feel of who we are. We need that as vendors and customers alike. Also posting 50 real posts allows you time to meet other newbies like yourself and to meet newbie vendors and to develop relationships that way. So when you hit 50 posts you arent a newbie at all. You are known to a small group of SR members and you spiderweb out from there. You have met and maybe done business with some of the newbie vendors thus helping them to become established and helping your own reputation as a buyer. <br />Just something I thought I would add. This is a great topic with very useful information.<br />

				So now I have had some time to venture over to the main forums where I have found a few topics I like to post in regularly and a few members I like to talk to. I have also learned quite a bit more that is worth posting for newbies and maybe not so newbies:<br /><br />Keep your posts toned down when you talk about vendors. Not all vendors are the same but they are all vendors so they can take offense to your opinions. You never know when you might need them. Not just that being a vendor is hard. I dont think that point is made often enough. So if all you see is bashing of the bad vendors or possibly bad customers bashing good vendors I can see how it could make someone a little resentful. We NEED our vendors to be happy. We want them to enjoy what they do and to see it as worth the hassle so that fulfilling the order and doing good business is something they are happy to do.<br /><br />Another thing about posting is unless you know you have it setup to where it cant be worked out backwards to you dont post &quot;im in CA and I ordered an OZ on Monday from vendor joe and it was sent USPS priority and it isnt here yet&quot; Joe states in his ad that he is from NY. Now anyone reading knows the origin and destination and that its a USPS priority package and they know whats in it and it hasnt arrived yet. That is way too much for &quot;them&quot; to work with and I would worry about them working hard to try and get the small bits of missing information to try and track it down. <br /><br />Never never never never FE there is no reason to. There are plenty of vendors with the same items or better that accept escrow. Most of the selective scamming I see is done to newbies. If you are going to FE figure on losing the money and/or the item and if it comes great and if not it was a calculated loss. Maybe start with small orders at first so if you lose the money its not a huge loss.<br /><br />Search the forums BEFORE you make any orders or decisions. They are chalk full of reviews and other information about vendors. Members are more than happy to give you referrals of well known reliable vendors for what you are looking for. Dont assume ASK.<br /><br />Abandon all hope and follow your senses. If an ad doesnt feel right or if the vendor doesnt feel right-anything. That sense you have is telling you something-LISTEN to it.<br /><br />Read all the feedback reviews on the vendors page. Negative reviews can be manipulated and buried under a slew of fake reviews left by bogus customer accounts OR it could be that someone FE and by the time they could update the rating it is buried. Read them all. <br /><br />Dont take anyones word that this works or that works to be safe and anonymous. Research it for yourself. This is your identity that you are protecting. TOR is great but have you read up all on the things you can do to expose your identity through TOR? Do you know what a VPN is? Why others use it? There is so much to know and you need to at least know what is available and why others use it. Then you can decide if it is right for you. There is alot more to be anonymous then just using TOR and BTC. <br /><br />That is another thing is getting a balance into your SR account may seem hard at first but once you know the safe methods (and learn the safe methods) look for ways to do it that dont cost you anymore in fees then you have to pay. It adds up from what you start with cash to what you end up with to spend.<br /><br />Keep an eye on the fluctuating price of the BTC and make your orders as soon as you can once you have a balance. Many many people (including me) have lost alot of money when the BTC price drops after purchasing it. <br /><br />Remember what you post can be read by all types of people including LE so make sure you include good amounts of misinformation from time to time to throw anyone off thats reading. Like I said earlier its easy enough to say what you want without using specific details that identify you or where you are.<br /><br />Ask your newbie questions here in the newbie section. Dont just post spam to 50 then head over to the main area and wonder why no one will answer the most basic questions &quot;whats PGP?&quot; Its all here in the forums you just need to dedicate the same amount of time into researching it as you do into browsing/shopping on SR.<br /><br />Look out for your fellow SR members. if you see something wrong say something. If you see someone needing help or heading for trouble advise them. If you see someone needing to vent over some bad transactions give them a break. Sometimes people just need to be validated. This is a community and the members that I have dealt with care about each other. Become part of that community. Dont be a unit of one looking out for just you. Looking for ways to capitalize on others misfortunes or mistakes. You will find strength in the numbers should you ever need them someday. I have seen the members in the main forum really come together on things and work as a group to solve dilemmas.<br /><br />Ask questions before you order. Confirm what stealth is to the vendor. Are there pills floating in an envelope? Is it professionally done or is it careless and risky? Get others experiences. Stealth is number one to me. It has to be undetectable for me to consider it stealth. That is what stealth is something that is undetectable for what it really is. If I can guess whats in there then others can too.<br /><br />Being a newbie think about all you know on how to protect you identity. Is it enough would you consider being a vendor using just what you are using alone? Well there are newbie vendors that dont know anymore than you. There are newbie vendors that if they are not cautious and dont use enough preventive measures to protect their identity and the identities of their customers then you can be doing the best possible job and it could be there inexperience that gets you caught up. Make sure you know who you are dealing with and if they know what they are doing.<br /><br />Know that LE can create a vendor account. LE can create forum user accounts. Sometimes it turns out to be the last person you would expect. As with anonymous and their spy (he doesnt deserve to have his name repeated) someone trusted in the community could be an FBI informant after getting busted and you wouldnt ever know it. So just always be aware and pay attention to what you give out as personal information to anyone.<br /><br />LE may even know and allow your package to get to you in hopes of using the knowledge they have now to try and catch other people through you or get you on a bigger order or with more ordering history. <br /><br />Always have a plan. Know what you will say and what you will do. When I go to my mail drop I have a whole list of things I do to prepare so that if anything happens to me between the time I leave to go get it and get back that im not leaving a trail of evidence behind me for anyone to find or work out. It can be a real hassle at times but its worth it knowing im prepared for the worst.<br /><br />REMEMBER LE CAN MAKE MULTIPLE MISTAKES WITH NO CONSEQUENCE YOU ONLY NEED TO MAKE ONE!<br /><br />&nbsp;:-*<br />

				If you arent using the forums for research before you make an order you are making a big mistake that you will one day regret. <br /><br />Even if you cannot post in the main forum yet due to being a newbie you can still ask here or just search the forums. You are sure to find something related to your search and if you dont that should make you think.<br /><br />As always if you FE kiss the money goodbye. It doesnt mean you wont get your item but if you do or dont that money is gone and you have NO recourse <br /><br />If you read everything posted up to this point in this topic and if you practice the things advised your experience on SR will be all that much better. There should have been some things that you said to yourself I didnt know that or I didnt think of that. <br /><br />Knowledge is power. Listen to those in the know and research research research.<br />Experience is a great teacher but mistakes in this world can be life altering. Having the knowledge before hand to prevent those mistakes is vital to your experience at SR.<br />Remember Hindsight is 20/20.<br /><br />Love this topic and add to it what you can.&nbsp; :-*

				Several posts back I offered a way to get on the local wi-fi connections in your area. Since then I have learned of an all together easier method and I thought I would post it here. If you try it and it works (and it WILL) and you want to make a donation thats great if not thats not a problem. Just share this information with other members that need it (newbies) and we will call it fair&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />This method is quite simple for WPA and WPA2 connections WEP is different. If you need that PM me and I will write it up here. You can search Youtube or the Internet and get step by step instructions if you have trouble understanding any of the things that are assumed you know in this writing. If you need more information PM me and I will help you with what I can. The shortest version I can come up with is this:<br /><br />Use your laptop. I havent used anything else myself. <br /><br />You will need Backtrack5 R3 that you can download by torrent or on the internet. <br />You will need to put it on a USB drive or DVD.<br />Boot your computer into Backtrack (BT).<br />Select &quot;BackTrack Text - Default Default Boot Text Mode&quot; and press enter.<br />At the prompt type startx and press enter.<br />Click Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Wicd Network Manager<br />Select your network and click connect and enter your password and click OK and then click connect a second time.<br />Click the Terminal button in the menu bar and press the ^ button to expand the screen (the v button minimizes).<br />At the prompt type apt-get update<br />After the update completes at the prompt type apt-get install reaver<br />I disconnect from the Internet but as I understand it doesnt matter.<br />In the Terminal at the prompt type iwconfig and press enter.<br />The wireless device in the list should say wlan0 but look for wlan1 or whatever it is and write it down.<br />Type airmon-ng start wlan0 or whatever yours was wlan1 etc.<br />The monitor mode interface should say mon0 write it down or whatever it is mon1 etc.<br />Now we find the BSID of the routers in your area (which are the w-ifi connections in your area!)<br />At the prompt type airodump-ng wlan0 or whatever yours was.<br />* If that doesnt work you can try airodump-ng mon0 or whatever it was.<br />You will see a list of the wireless connections within range.<br />When you see the network you want press ctrl+c to stop the list from refreshing.<br />Then either copy the BSSID down on paper or highlight it and right click and copy it. Its the series of letters and numbers and colons on the left side an example would be: DD:6F:3E:B2:DB:18<br />If you look you will also see the AP SSID or name of the wi-fi signal you want to crack. <br />The network should have WPA or WPA2 listed under the ENC column.<br />*WEP needs a different guide PM me if you need it and I will post it here.<br />At the prompt type reaver -i mon0 (or whatever yours is) -b (here you put your BSSID you copied down or right click copied) -vv<br />an example would be: reaver -i mon0 -b DD:6F:3E:B2:DB:18 -vv <br />Then you just press enter and wait. I have had it take 18 hours for one to crack and 8 hours for a different one. <br /><br />When it DOES crack it will give you a bunch of information:<br />BSSID: this is the BSSID number you entered.<br />WPS PIN: this is the pin number it took to crack it after all those tries.<br />WPA PSK: this is the password or network security key that you need to get on the wi-fi signal you chose. WRITE IT DOWN.<br />AP SSID: this is the name of the BSSID or wi-fi signal that you wanted to crack.<br /><br />Thats it. It is very easy and anyone can do it. I pop onto different ones using my TOR on my Tails drive and you can make your orders across a different wi-fi signal then your own. If you appreciate the work let me know. Doesnt have to be a donation a simple acknowledgement telling me it worked for you would be great!<br />&nbsp;:-*

				@ Mike Hunt<br /><br />I do it for the community man, the more people we can educate in here the less heat SR catches in the long run!<br /><br />I want people to have the same anonymity, safety, fun that I do here!<br /><br />If I can save 1 person from being scammed or getting sent to prison I have done my job!<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />*Newest Addition*<br /><br />-So what happens if I know/think my order has been seized?<br /><br />Well, I am fairly educated on what to do if caught, but not how the process actually works... This is information I have acquired through a lot of reading on here.<br /><br />OK so there are two things that can happen if you are compromised &amp; LE is trying to find something on you.<br /><br />1. They will send you a letter from customs, (love letter) as we like to call it. I have not personally seen one but from what I understand if you recieve this you are lucky. It is basically a slap on the wrist, they know what your up to, your address is flagged, never order to that address again, lay low for a while...<br />No drugs in the house ever...<br /><br />2. This is where the shit really hits the fan, if your order is seized and they don&#039;t send you a love letter you are likely a target for a CONTROLLED DELIVERY!<br /><br />This is not good at all....<br /><br />Basically what will happen is that you normal mailman, or a federal agent in disguise, will deliver your package to you as expected.<br /><br />The typical method of incriminating you is that they will arrive at your door with your pack, and ask you to sign for it...<br /><br />Once you sign that paper you are fully accepting responsibility for that package, your done....<br /><br />If you ordered something that doesn&#039;t require a signature DON&#039;T SIGN, this is a CD...<br /><br />I have also heard other tactics such as....<br /><br />Leaving your box in your mailbox, waiting for you to pick it up, then snatch you...<br /><br />or in other cases I have heard they insert a light sensitive blue pack in your package which works like the ones tellers put in money when someone robs a bank<br />&amp; it lets them know when it&#039;s opened.<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t open the door, you DO NOT have to unless they have a warrant, which they don&#039;t or they wouldn&#039;t be a knockiin&#039;<br />2. House should ALWAYS BE CLEAN (they will tear it APART)<br />3. Always make sure your stuff is encrypted on your computers &amp; not in plain site when you log onto it (they will seize them as evidence)<br />4. Use a good reliable vendor whose stealth is top tier and this problem will never occur.<br />5. Let everyone in your home NOT TO OPEN THE DOOR.<br />6. If they take you into custody, DO NOT TALK!!!!!<br />7. Lawyer up always.... Stay quiet, they will intimidate the fuck out of you but if they are talking to you, that means they can&#039;t convict you yet &amp; they need you to slip up.<br />8. Deny, Deny, Deny, anyone can send you drugs in the mail! <br /><br />This is also why it is important to only try and keep one order at a time coming in....<br /><br />Cause if they catch your pack of buds, &amp; then another pack comes in for some yayo the next day your ability to deny is GONE!<br />

				When it comes down to talking to the police or knowing my rights in a particular situation I have never known too much. Only now that I am on SR I did some studying up to try and educate myself as to how to handle myself when dealing with the police and what to say. <br />I found this information in a torrent called &quot;protect your rights dont let them be take from you&quot; or else it was &quot;dont let them GET taken from you&quot; that has so much information and it amazed me was how little I knew. <br /><br />There are is a series of videos included that consists of a lawyer talking to a group of people and advising them of their rights and how to respond to police.<br /><br />The group of people explain situations and experiences they have recently gone through with the police and what happened as a result. <br />The lawyer then explains what their rights are and tells them how they should have handled it. The lawyer tells them what police can and cannot do. <br />It is very educational and I recommend if you can get it that you take a look at it. <br /><br />I will try to get more information on the name of the series itself or more information in general and edit this post or post a new reply with the information.<br /><br />Maybe I can go compile the finer points together into something readable and post them.<br /><br />I have some information in addition to those videos that is along those lines. I will come back to repost what I can compile together. <br /><br />Until then if anyone has anything they can add in regards to the police your rights and the law please post what you know.<br />*White outs post inspired me :)<br /><br />

				Like others I&#039;ve made quite a few purchases on SR and The Scurvy Crew are on my &#039;go to list&#039; of hash vendors you can trust.<br /><br />I generally review everything I buy off SR and my recent purchase of the Scurvy Crew Pakistani Hash is no exception.<br /><br />The hash is certainly No 1 quality, I would imagine its an Indica hash, more your end of the day smoke than a sly one in work at 9.00am&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Some people tend to burn hash to build a joint but my advice is simply break off enough for a joint and use the heat of your hands and fingers to make it pliable. This makes for a more natural taste plus you lose no THC.<br /><br />My hash came to the UK in 3 working days - excellent stealth plus it came in one of those new mylar (or whatever) smell proof bags which can reused as it has a little plastic fastener.<br /><br />The hash itself - the taste is pretty subtle - very smooth. The strength becomes apparent in a few minutes and you won&#039;t be smoking it in one. The high is a classic Indica - for med use its a winner as I have a buddy who has a pretty bad medical condition (MS) and he tends to prefer a hash with a good body stone. We have also partaken of the Ketama Sativa hash off the Scurvy Crew and these two hashes are pretty much all you need. <br /><br />For younger people who have grown up with bud and the nasty shit of an excuse for hash in the UK, I would suggest you try out more quality hashes as its a revelation. Consider that hashish is the concentrate of the bud. 80% of bud is inactive material, also, a lot of UK bud is badly grown, harvested too early and would never pass the criteria for &#039;med grade&#039;. <br /><br />I have been a fan of eating hash since before some of you were born. Eating hash is a &#039;must do&#039;. I could not think of a nicer way to spend a summer evening than eating some hash with buddies. I sometimes leave out alcohol and eat some hash instead. The beauty of hash eating is that you can be anything from slightly merry to pretty much wiped out. Try camping out and eating some hash! <br /><br />One thing about Pakistani hash is that its almost the same as Indian hash. Either way they are in the same geographic area although the different regions all produce a hash which will differ although in a subtle manner. <br /><br />This Pakistani hash is certainly different than my other fav hash here which is Moroccan No 1 - vendor Atlas2012. I thought that hash was THE best on SR but got to say that this Pakistani hash is a tie. For a body stone, the Pakistani hash wins. This is why its a great hash for med use. It can make a big difference depending on the condition. Hashish hash been used for thousands of years as a medicine and nothing much hash changed there. <br /><br />There are some great hashes on SR sold by honest vendors who are good traders. Yes, they want to make money but they want to do so in way that leaves the customer feeling like its a fair deal. Good hash is not &#039;cheap&#039; but prices here are fair and I have NEVER had a package not turn up - ever! And that goes for buddies with other accounts here!<br /><br />I&#039;m lucky enough not to have to FE, but the only reason vendors ask this is simple. Scammers! When I first joined here I had to FE so chose vendors carefully. All lived up to their side of the deal and I&#039;ve only had one hash off here that looked great in the listing photo but when it arrived it was a bag of dust. I ate 2 grams of it and felt nothing. The re-send was the same shit! That is the hit on my stats. <br /><br />Hash in the UK is mostly &#039;soap bar&#039;, 9 ounce &#039;pucks&#039; which in reality is real hashish broken up and remixed and re-pressed. It is cheap but nasty. If you extracted the actual hash content it would be VERY low. So, if you have been raised on this rubbish, do yourself a favor and order a gram or two from The Scurvy Crew. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Lovely stuff!<br /><br />Coming soon - lets mix some of the Pakistani hash with some opium! Full report coming soon! <br /><br />I promise you that my reviews are 100% fact and based on my personal use of said substance!<br /><br />The Scurvy Crew hash selection is all good!<br /><br />The Pakistani hash - I&#039;d love a joint of it right now but got to go out and do some work so I will leave that as a homecoming prize! <br /><br />Fantastic with a cup of tea!<br /><br />Hash is the best of drugs in my opinion. But, I like other things also.<br /><br />Thanks Scurvy Crew!

Prosecution of end-users is rare, but sending this type of contraband through the mail is a federal crime, punishable, if my memory serves me, by five years in prison per item sent.<br /><br />If you really don&#039;t feel imperiled yourself, then take precautions for your provider, who is really taking a serious risk and whom LE would LOVE to tag. If LE has nothing on you, then they have nothing to leverage you into ratting out your source. (Yes, w/ SR and btc, sellers are anonymized, at least from the buyer&#039;s perspective, but SR is a big thorn in Big Brother&#039;s side and SR has been in the spotlight for a while now.)<br /><br />But, hey, I&#039;m not trying to make anybody paranoid - YOU SHOULD ALREADY BE PARANOID ABOUT HAVING ILLICIT SUBSTANCES SENT TO YOU THROUGH THE MAIL.<br /><br />Me, I just feel sloppy and, frankly, stupid if I don&#039;t take sensible precautions - like destroying packing materials, including labels, keeping my residence free of anything left in plain view, not opening packages until I get to my stash spot, etc.<br /><br />Many good advices have been given here, in that regard. Many, many Thanks to White Out and all contributors. I am in your debt.

				Copy &amp; Pasted this from the vendor forums! Found it to contain some super useful info!<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t ship direct to your residence. Get a secure drop. Derp. Don&#039;t ever sign.<br />2. Don&#039;t import. Customs is a bitch.<br />3. Don&#039;t get anything stinky in the mail. 90% of CDs are marijuana detected by drug dogs.<br />4. Don&#039;t tell anyone that you are getting packages. Snitches are the other 10%.<br />5. Clean your workspace before shipping. Use thick gloves (not latex!) and a hairnet if you are super paranoid or the government has your DNA on file. NEVER leave fingerprints anywhere, even the outside of packages. Put your packages in another envelope and use that envelope to drop it in the blue box.<br />6. Don&#039;t check tracking with TOR unless through a shipping proxy website. This is debatable as I&#039;ve never seen it directly cause a CD or flag but you can never be too careful.<br />7. Don&#039;t bother trying to hide drugs inside other items. Make your packages as flat as possible and appear to be documents. This is your best bet.<br />8. Obviously, if shipping high-risk smelly items, MBB is a must. Not shipping such drugs is ideal.<br />9. Don&#039;t develop a pattern. Keep your post office purchases, shipping dates, drop boxes different every time.<br />10. Switch up packaging, return addresses, fonts, etc. to avoid profile packaging. Remember you are probably shipping to at least a few cops.<br />11. Avoid face to face at all costs. This is the biggest risk you could take. You are 99% more likely to get busted IRL then online. You get busted F2F and then they find evidence you are shipping, well then there&#039;s a few more charges for you.<br />12. Figure a secure way to cash out and avoid exchanges. Cash in mail to a drop from trusted folks who buy more drugs with it is best. Don&#039;t let it link to your real identity at all. Keep your bitcoins in the drug economy.<br />13, Always use TOR, FDE, encrypted containers, GPG (4096 bit or ECC), OS isolation, disable JavaScript and other insecure technologies. If you are using the TBB on Windows for vending, that&#039;s NOT enough. Your best bet is configuring an old laptop with your favorite flavor of Linux, spoofing the MAC address every time and using open WiFi. Do all business under a properly configured Whonix VM. Better yet, use Qubes if your hardware will support it. This way, even if you were exploited, they would need to hack out of your isolated VM. Even if that happened, you&#039;d be on an open WiFi with spoofed MAC that would lead nowhere except your general location which they will already know by ordering from you. Keep no identifying information on this machine. Don&#039;t use a laptop with a webcam/microphone built into it. If you must, then disable them in the BIOS and physically block them.<br />14. Regularly check your car for GPS trackers. Leave your phone at home while doing anything vending related. GPS information is free to the government and not protected under any law, so sayeth the Supreme Court. It can be requested by any LEO without a warrant. At least in the USA, I am pretty sure the mailmen pick up from the blue boxes and it all gets mixed together in the back of the truck with mail from other boxes on their route. Tracking and postmarking doesn&#039;t happen until the acceptance facility, so it would be hard to figure out where certain packs were actually picked up without quizzing the army of mailmen directly and even then their memory will be foggy from picking up hundreds of packs a day.<br />15. Don&#039;t ever handwrite addresses. Handwriting analysis is an old tool at this point.<br />16. Don&#039;t use e-mail. It is insecure and can be hacked/seized. If you must, then always use GPG for any sort of communication.<br />17. Keep the amount of people who know about your operation to the very minimum. Don&#039;t brag. Trust no one. Don&#039;t think you are a bad-ass drug dealer and are invincible. This is totally immature behavior that will lead to getting busted. If you are in a serious relationship, only tell them if you must and have been with them for years. Remember, if you get busted, they will almost undoubtedly attempt to turn them against you in return for protection. Don&#039;t implicate others in your operation in any way if you truly care about them.<br />18. Always obey traffic laws. Dress like a well respected member of society. Don&#039;t speed down the street in a murdered-out Yugo dreaded and dressed in a Slayer shirt blaring your music (extreme example). Remember, cops are always profiling people and pulling them over based on it even if they say they aren&#039;t.<br />19. Have a goal set and then QUIT when you reach it. You don&#039;t realize it when you start, but vending is addictive as fuck. It is REALLY hard to stop once you get that kind of cash flow coming in. Remind yourself that everyone gets busted eventually, even those with the best opsec. There is three endings to this situation: prison, death, or quitting while you are ahead (best). At the very least, take long breaks and come back if you truly need to make more money. Think about this... How much money do you REALLY need? A five or six digit goal can turn into seven really quick once you are doing well. Don&#039;t be greedy.<br />20. Hold a good job and don&#039;t deposit cash into banks that you can&#039;t explain. Stash your cash away and only spend it on small, untracked purchases ($1000 or less) or come up with a good plan to launder it. Going to the bar and dropping a few thousand buying everyone drinks will draw attention pretty fast.<br />21. Never sell (or store/vend) no crack where you rest at. I don&#039;t care if they want an ounce, tell em bounce.<br />22. Don&#039;t give out tracking numbers unless a problem has occurred. If the customer doesn&#039;t get this then explain it to them. Addicts are impatient but if they can&#039;t deal then tell them to go elsewhere.<br />23. Only ship from major metropolitan areas. If you live in a small town with one post office and three drop boxes, drive to the nearest metro area to make your drops or forget it. Remember, driving long distances increases your risk of local LE encounters.<br />24. Obviously, never throw anything vending/drug related in the trash at your residence. Dispose of it by burning it or in public trash cans. Be sure to destroy any identifying information in the waste (address labels).<br />25. Never say anything on the phone. Your phone is for legit purposes only. Burners are no good. They can identify your voice and pull a new number straight off the cell tower based on statistical analysis. Any sensitive communications must be encrypted. If the people you work with don&#039;t use encryption, teach them. If they refuse to learn, find new partners.<br />26. Be paranoid and observant. Always watch for tails. Remember they work in teams and can be tricky. Use evasive driving.<br />27. Any rules from F2F dealing also apply here, even I forgot to mention them. If you don&#039;t know, listen to The 10 Crack Commandments by Notorious B.I.G. <br />

I havent used anything else myself. <br /><br />You will need Backtrack5 R3 that you can download by torrent or on the internet. <br />You will need to put it on a USB drive or DVD.<br />Boot your computer into Backtrack (BT).<br />Select &quot;BackTrack Text - Default Default Boot Text Mode&quot; and press enter.<br />At the prompt type startx and press enter.<br />Click Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Wicd Network Manager<br />Select your network and click connect and enter your password and click OK and then click connect a second time.<br />Click the Terminal button in the menu bar and press the ^ button to expand the screen (the v button minimizes).<br />At the prompt type apt-get update<br />After the update completes at the prompt type apt-get install reaver<br />I disconnect from the Internet but as I understand it doesnt matter.<br />In the Terminal at the prompt type iwconfig and press enter.<br />The wireless device in the list should say wlan0 but look for wlan1 or whatever it is and write it down.<br />Type airmon-ng start wlan0 or whatever yours was wlan1 etc.<br />The monitor mode interface should say mon0 write it down or whatever it is mon1 etc.<br />Now we find the BSID of the routers in your area (which are the w-ifi connections in your area!)<br />At the prompt type airodump-ng wlan0 or whatever yours was.<br />* If that doesnt work you can try airodump-ng mon0 or whatever it was.<br />You will see a list of the wireless connections within range.<br />When you see the network you want press ctrl+c to stop the list from refreshing.<br />Then either copy the BSSID down on paper or highlight it and right click and copy it. Its the series of letters and numbers and colons on the left side an example would be: DD:6F:3E:B2:DB:18<br />If you look you will also see the AP SSID or name of the wi-fi signal you want to crack. <br />The network should have WPA or WPA2 listed under the ENC column.<br />*WEP needs a different guide PM me if you need it and I will post it here.<br />At the prompt type reaver -i mon0 (or whatever yours is) -b (here you put your BSSID you copied down or right click copied) -vv<br />an example would be: reaver -i mon0 -b DD:6F:3E:B2:DB:18 -vv <br />Then you just press enter and wait. I have had it take 18 hours for one to crack and 8 hours for a different one. <br /><br />When it DOES crack it will give you a bunch of information:<br />BSSID: this is the BSSID number you entered.<br />WPS PIN: this is the pin number it took to crack it after all those tries.<br />WPA PSK: this is the password or network security key that you need to get on the wi-fi signal you chose. WRITE IT DOWN.<br />AP SSID: this is the name of the BSSID or wi-fi signal that you wanted to crack.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for such an informative post. Coincidentally, i was attempting to do this yesterday running backtrack in virtualbox but instead of getting a wlan0 mine was eth0. can i not use the network card from virtualbox?<br /><br /><br />Some exceptional insight, been looking for such an expansive well of n00b info for ages.<br /><br />Thanks to all the contributors!

Regardless of who reads this, or how far we continue as a whole I love you all very much and each and every one of you will hold a deep spot in my heart for many years to come!<br /><br />I have changed the way I think, my beliefs, and my overall life style thanks to what I have learned here, it can only make one a better person.
