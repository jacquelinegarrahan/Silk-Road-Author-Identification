				Hello my peeps! :)<br /><br />Ok I might as well say this now: I&#039;m a [REMOVED]<br /><br />I am relatively new to SR and the forums, and as far as the drugs go, I&#039;m very new, I have only done a little soft drugs (1/2 gram of sour diesel in a fat joint) and before you start preaching about that it will f**k up my life, I intend to keep it to soft drugs. I might dabble with some psychedelics as well, but as far as all those heavy dopamine releasing drugs go and the narcotics I&#039;m going to stay away from that.<br /><br />I live in [REMOVED] so if you&#039;re willing to hook me up w/ some ganja or some shrooms, I&#039;d be cool w/ that due to the long process of gaining BTC and going to find vendors<br /><br />But enough about that, I might say a little bit about myself<br />-Reggae is the best of all music, (bob &amp; ziggy marley FTW) but in close second is dub step ( weird combo I know)<br /><br />-My cousin enjoys 420, I just don&#039;t have the guts to ask him. :l<br /><br />-I play acoustic and electric guitar, and I rock climb competitively<br /><br />-As [REMOVED], I love Mexican fusion food (nothing beats some carne asada tacos for the munchies)<br /><br />-I speak Spanish quite well, but my verb conjugations are a bit shaky<br /><br />So that&#039;s pretty much all you need to know about me, I have an email for all drug related stuff:<br />[REMOVED]<br />And if you&#039;re feeling generous you can send me some BTC through my wallet:<br /><br /><br />1Pi8VhzPqSoB3CVMRL4nv9mVjazaX5DAkX<br /><br />In the reply section, tell me some stuff about yourself, and feel free to advertise if you&#039;re a vendor<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Alphaviper42

				Hi, I am a smallish, ebony furry household feline. I like licking myself in public, urking up hairballs for the humans in residence to squish with an exclamation of &quot;god dammit fucking cats puked up a hairball and I just stepped in it&quot;. I admit to a southeast china catnip habit. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got cat class and I&#039;ve got cat style.<br /><br />
