				I am relegated to the newbie forums although i wanted to add something to the lsd threads concerning a review for Jor&#039;s acid. It will have to go here.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />I purchased Jesus of Rave lotus vial and it was received promptly.<br /><br />I took some! It was approximated to be 100mg per drop. I took 3 drops on a sunny day...<br /><br />The transition between &quot;hmm... I&#039;m starting to feel like I&#039;m on acid&quot; to instant ego death was rapid. At some point in the long day of art making and sun-gazing, I had a transcended experience that seemed like becoming Christ on the Cross, lifted into the heavens, and an abduction. Literally my body seemed to lift up into a warm sunset dotted with beautiful UFO lights. Then I fell! I think due to my occult readings, I began (after the fall) to witness a hell realm around me. This was not frightening or painful. I looked around myself in a recreational outdoor setting and everything appeared as if I had &quot;fallen&quot; from grace and was stuck here in a limbo of not &quot;releasing completely&quot; into the heavenly abduction. I walked on a beach and was really in awe of the sky above and ocean below as a miniscule window of the vastness of ALL. Many insights from this experience...<br /><br />My second excursion I took four hits in around the same park setting. I made a little safe zone in the foliage for meditation and to paint. I had a peaking feeling that it was too much and ate a banana. (This is because I was told not be an expert but by a halucinogen enthusiast that bananas can help come down from too high of a trip). After the banana I settled down with some music and did art... What I experienced was something like &quot;a wrestling with God&quot; as I stayed within my magic circle. I had to confront deep fears like rooting out psychic tendrils from the Earth, diving into a water where I wasn&#039;t sure who I was, but in some way, realized that I Never knew who I was. Old ideas and skins I had assumed were followed down the Abyss. In the end, I came out of this tribulation feeling to have discovered sources of anxiety, dis-ease, and doubt, at their very core, and to have &quot;Gone Through&quot; the Death that these ghosts were made of... In the end, I scooped up some earth in my hand, as a way to remind myself of my Earthly dimension, and stood up feeling much more centered than before I decided to undergo this process!<br /><br />In other words, thank you Jesus of Rave. The first experience I came down to the hell realm for not completeley letting go, and even this was ver y lucid and insightful. The second, being the complete apprehension and going through death, gave way to the most pure non-dual apprehension... I (from then on) walked back to the city experiencing other past lives... but this is beyond the scope of this post...<br /><br />Thanks jor! Stellar review.<br /><br />Auth...

				You have an excellent way with words and one that really made me feel as if I was there experiencing it too.&nbsp; For those of us versed in psychedelics it can certainly trigger memories of similar experiences so my hats off to you.&nbsp; Time to save me some bitpennies...

				Great trip report, thanks. I&#039;ve also had some of JoR&#039;s lotuses (in tab form) and they&#039;ve always been amazing.
