				I took the plunge and placed my first two small orders within the last hour or two: Some Sativa Cheeba Chews from Nice Deal, and one BIG PACK sample from Xinhai. Just received a &quot;Do not reply&quot; message from Xinhai cancelling my order without any explanation. Guess it comes with being new to SR, but it still irritates me.<br />On the other hand, it is a whole lot better than getting scammed. <br />

				Hey MG, <br />***Read Carefully each Vendor&#039;s requirements for buying***.&nbsp; They *may look at your buying stats/history, and by that not allow you to buy bc you have not &quot;established&quot; yourself yet, or have had enough purchases.&nbsp; Some may wish you to Finalize Early... Not recommended because you may lose your money.&nbsp; Read the message at the top right of SR Main Page from DPR.&nbsp; Use your best sense or instincts :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay safe man!

				D - Thanks for your response. Your comments make good sense. I have already read a lot, and will continue to read more.<br /><br />I am at the point where I feel I need to get a couple small orders going, if I am actually going to learn the ropes. I am sure it will take some time. I&#039;ll probably get some more orders cancelled, which will continue to be irritating but understandable.<br /><br />Definitely going to keep it small for a good while. Like gambling, avoid putting more money at risk than I can afford to lose. FE is completely out of the question for me. I have seen that strongly recommended multiple times.<br /><br />Since xinhai just cancelled my order, I just ordered an 1/8 oz of weed from HappySmoke420. I will post how it goes.<br /><br />Thx again.
