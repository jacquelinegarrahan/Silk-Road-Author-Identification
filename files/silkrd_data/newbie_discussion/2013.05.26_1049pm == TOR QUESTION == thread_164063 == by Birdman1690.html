				Hi, I&#039;m curious if there are any sites that should never be visited while using the tor browser that could potential expose your IP address? Thanks.

				Ofcourse, there are tons, unfortunately you won&#039;t know that until you&#039;ve already clicked it so don&#039;t click any links from strangers! Candy is okay though.

				so its possible for a website to figure out your real IP address even though TOR makes your IP address appear different? I didnt think something like this was possible, i thought TOR was for browsing anonymously?&nbsp;

				I am truly stupid when it comes to this stuff but my techy friend explained it like this, please anyone chime in as he may have just been explaning as simply as possible.<br /><br />When you torify something its like putting a bullet proof vest around it, safe but not impenetrable.&nbsp; &nbsp; Don&#039;t go walking into gunfire ie clicking random links and going to any site.&nbsp; <br /><br />When your using the tor bundle bundle your using a torified browser, as long as you stay in that window any sites you go to are going to see your torified ip address.&nbsp; Inside the tor browser, your IP is masked and any traffic is routed through tor, so your ISP can&#039;t see what you do and other sites can&#039;t see who you are.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Your computer is still connected though and possibly doing internet things even if your not actively browsing the web.&nbsp; So I can see not browsing outside of tor to help with bandwidth but that would be it.

				USPS.com (US mail website)<br /><br />Reason?<br /><br />You&#039;re checking a tracking number on something you&#039;ve ordered that&#039;s illegal.<br /><br />Their end see&#039;s you&#039;re using Tor. - &quot;Tracking number flagged&quot;<br /><br />Prepare for a CD.

				Yeah, tracking codes are sketch, I wouldn&#039;t use them even if a vendor offered unless a package went missing or didn&#039;t show up and I needed to resolve it.&nbsp; Even then I would only want SR people checking it to see if I&#039;m lying,

				I don&#039;t believe anything is impossible, which includes TOR, at some point, being anything but anonymous. Everything breaks eventually. Adaptation is the key to survival. However, I think it&#039;s highly improbable. Combined with constant updating of flaws and the sheer number of people using TOR, I feel pretty safe that my anonymity is secure. I&#039;d be very disappointed to see TOR cracked by the government.<br /><br />In the words of Creed Bratton: &quot;If I can&#039;t scuba, then what&#039;s all this been about?&quot;

				Yeah, I think changing your tor identity often and making sure to disable all scripts such as javascript and flash and such if the most basic one can do to try to mitigate possible leaks in tor&#039;s security.&nbsp; I think the modified version of firefox that the tor browser uses is pretty good. It disables most things by default.&nbsp; Running tor as a extension on a normal version of firefox or another browser is much more sketch
