				Ok, so I&#039;ve bought off SR before in the past a few times. Have made deposits, etc. And they&#039;ve all been successful. However today I deposited coins from my wallet (had to switch from QT to Multi-coin, long story). Changing my wallet over wasn&#039;t a hassle. On the client it even says it&#039;s successfully transferred the coins to the address I gave it (my SR one).<br /><br />Normally my coins only take an hour or two at most to transfer to my SR account. However it&#039;s been several hours (8+) and still nothing. I used the same address as before, not realizing til after that they recommend using a diff address for each deposit. However I&#039;ve used this same address at least 3 times before with no problems. Why is it taking this long to get my coins? Is it normal for it to take this long? Or have I lost my coins?<br /><br /><br />TL;DR - I transferred bitcoins from my wallet to my SR account; and it&#039;s now been 8+ hours and they haven&#039;t shown up. Have I lost them?<br /><br />Help much appreciated. Cheers! -A

				It may be because you used a different wallet this time that takes longer to confirm (such as Bitcoin Fog). Also, check to make sure you didn&#039;t accidentally log in via a phishing link or otherwise its possible your coins were stolen.

				Wait it out. There was a problem earlier in the day and there is backlog to clear if I&#039;m not mistaken. Ull be alright, they will either show up where you sent them or&nbsp; if there was an error they will go back to where you sent them from.

				Cheers for the responses! <br /><br />Well, it&#039;s now morning and still nothing. It&#039;s been approx 18+ hours since my initial transfer. I&#039;m really hoping it&#039;s an SR problem (with the backlog etc); but it&#039;s never taken this long before and now I&#039;m getting a bad feeling I might have lost my coins.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />As for phishing etc, I always use the real SR link (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/) which I always c/p from a notepad file. So I don&#039;t reckon they were stolen. Here&#039;s me hoping they weren&#039;t though....

				There were some errors and a subsequent delay, which is probably why your coins haven&#039;t shown up yet.&nbsp; Some people have started receiving their deposits / withdrawals, so I&#039;m guess the issue has been fixed and that there&#039;s just a backlog now.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t received them in 12 hours, send a message on the main site to customer support.

				Ok, I&#039;ve been on Multicoin to see what the go is. And I tried looking up the transaction with the deposit address.. According to Multicoin, the transaction is unconfirmed; and when I try searching for it at blockchain.info &amp; blockexplorer.com; the transaction doesn&#039;t exist.. WTF? <br /><br />Have I lost my coins? Or have they yet to be confirmed by SR? Because when I went on their FAQ I saw this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If your deposit still hasn&#039;t shown up, first check that it is showing up on the blockchain by searching for your deposit address on a site like blockchain.info. If your transfer doesn&#039;t appear here, then it was never sent and you need to find out why from the person or organization who initiated the transfer. If the transfer does appear, then there could be a problem on our end and you should contact us. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Check out this screenshot. Basically sums it up.<br /><br />http://i.imgur.com/lZFGPYu.jpg

				OP could be a mix of wallet backlogged, and SR backlogged. All the best bro, in my experience always works out for you unless you got phished by a fake wallet?

				hmmm.. doesn&#039;t sound too good mate, sorry to hear it. I usually get my BTC within the hour to my SR wallet, however today it took 2 1/2 hours! And that was a direct deposit to my SR wallet - not transferring from my blockchain wallet to my SR one - but having the people I bought the BTC from deposit to SR. It showed up on the blockchain as being successful &amp; completed, however it took another 45 minutes after that for it to be credited to my account.. and because of that fucking around, i missed the shipping deadline &amp; have to wait til Monday!!! aaaarggghhhh! used allmy real cash on these poxy BTC &amp; now I have to wait pretty much 4 days!!! so fucked....

				Shit 45 minutes and i would have been happy. It took 5 hours for me but worked out still. I&#039;m doing overnight shipping and my order is already in. That phishing scam got me yesterday and i was concerned about getting my transaction completed as soon as my funds hit and mission accomplished. Middle finger to the scumbag robbing people with trick links here. Congratulations too you cock gobbler. You got me for a whopping .02 coins worth about 1-2 dollars. Maybe you can buy a condom with that money and help the world by not contaminating it with any more future thieves. You are welcome to try getting into my account again but everything i use on S.R. is new now and i get to keep my 1 account i had for almost 2 years.I will never click on ant other link anywhere on S.R. even though many of them are legit.&nbsp; If you need a job however I will hire you to provide members you stole larger amounts from the ability to exact revenge on you with a cattle prod to your asshole. I already pay your welfare income....is that not enough you cunt. Do you need to steal also. Well how about this You can steal the corn from my shit right before you eat it. You must need the help and this will save you on food stamps for the week. (no offense to people on welfare that need it)....just for the lying fucks that abuse it or fuck like rabbits to pop out kids for child support disgust me. ....ok I&#039;m done expressing myself

My thought&#039;s exactly dude. It&#039;s fucked. Fucking scumbags.<br /><br /><br /><br />On a lighter note though, I worked out the problem; turns out it was the wallet. Went on the Multicoin forums just before and they said if there&#039;s a white square next to the transaction, it didn&#039;t successfully send; and to &quot;Reset blockchain and transactions&quot; in the Tools menu.<br /><br />Did this, and my coins are still there... Thank fuck. So looks like I&#039;m not using Multicoin again. Back to QT. However when I open it, it keeps saying &quot;2 weeks behind&quot; and just hangs on block 244501 of 247154... Like, all day and not one single movement. Hence why I originally switched to Multicoin.<br /><br />Fucking hell. I just want my fucking drugs already! It shouldn&#039;t be this much of a hassle!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Cheers for the all the help though.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; -T
