				Hi all,<br /><br />I have been trolling this site for a couple of months now and the only thing holding me back from making a purchase is fear.<br /><br />I keep reading the forums and especially reviews from domestic shippers here in the States. I live in the part of the country that is not 420 friendly and climate wise very hot.<br /><br />One question I have is why won&#039;t the vendors move to using mylar bagging over the other options I read?<br /><br />Second, can someone advise any domestic vendors that offer the best stealth shipping on SR.

				Every herbal package I have received has been double mylar&#039;d, and I&#039;ve ordered from about 7 different vendors.

				-.- Please....If you&#039;re fucking to scared to order weed, then you have no place here.<br />Every vendor ive ever dealt with who sells weed, they&#039;re fucking top notch stealth.<br /><br />State to State is fucking easy shit, its when you order from outside of the US where your fears should be.<br /><br />Cause anything coming into the US from another country is gonna be scrutinized more by Customs, than some low level USPS worker sorting mail.<br /><br />And as long as you pay for priority shipping, you shouldnt have anything to fear.<br /><br />The bags most vendors use with stealth are genuinely dog proof&nbsp; due to multiple heat sealed layers preventing that stink of the weed from getting out.<br /><br /><br />Man up Pussy. Buy some Coin, buy some bud. I buy at least an ounce every week, and ive never had a problem getting a package delivered or anything.<br />

				never had a problem,<br />care for curious people (customs, neighbors)...<br /><br />otherwise no legal issues:<br />I&#039;ve ordered salvia, kratom, green, kief, powder etc.<br />to various of countries...<br /><br />just don&#039;t be greedy, order reasonable amounts.<br /><br />don&#039;t buy bulk if you are scared...

				Shipping salvia and kratom is nothing like weed...those are legal in most states... <br /><br />Shipping weed is only hard because of the smell, but if you vaccuum seal it enough times noone is gonna smell shit.

				I wouldnt know. I only order from within the US. <br /><br />Because customs has a nasty habit of finding drugs mailed to the us from other countries.
