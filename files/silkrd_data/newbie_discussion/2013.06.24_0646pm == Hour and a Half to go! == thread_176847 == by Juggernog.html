				Yeah, did you get your stuff?&nbsp; The worst is when you&#039;re waiting for the mail to arrive, watching the minutes and hours tick by, and then it comes, and your order isn&#039;t there.&nbsp; Then you start the wait all over again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(

				no shit. I had planned on staying up as late as possible tonight, so Ill wake up just a few hours from delivery time. Doesn&#039;t seem like that is going to happen though. Have some obligations to take care of tomorrow, that would have been much easier with my goods, but oh well.<br /><br />

				LOL leave it to me to get peoples blood pumping.. It almost makes me not be able to sleep. I just lay there thinking. Hoping I did everything right, hoping I didn&#039;t choose a bad vendor. Hoping I don&#039;t get ripped off (I&#039;m already broke enough). And of course hoping that it arrives.
