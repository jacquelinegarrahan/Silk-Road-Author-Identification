Just common sense right..? This has been around forever, where have you been?<br /><br />I have a 14 day. Then the server assumes I&#039;m dead or in jail. My peeps get emails for info they need to know.<br /><br />With something this big (SR) it had to have been considered and implemented somehow.<br /><br />Oh, and thanks for your helpful input!

				There are many explanations for this, its possible as people say that they caught him while he was logged into admin control panel and they have kept his account online since to stop any deadmans switch. <br /><br />Or heres another wacked out theory, lets say the FBI are watching him for weeks as they 99% probably were, couldnt they just go into the places they see him using to go online and install hardware keyloggers on all the keyboards, or use cameras to capture all his passwords, the local library , local internet cafe etc, even break into his house and install a hardware keylogger on his own keyboard/laptop ? <br /><br />What defense could he have had against this i wonder, none really that i can see?

				No kill switch. Sorry guys. DPR got caught with his laptop on, logged in. Six agents tackled him in a public library. Then they uploded the seiZure notice image from DPRs own laptop as they were cuffing him.<br /><br />Move on, stay safe. Hope you all used pgp.

				please bear with me.. 14 posts to 50.. been here all this time. I&#039;m an introvert mostly and for the most part kept to myself and just lurked the vendors I was about to purchase from.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of how things could have been done differently to allow for a proper dead man&#039;s switch.
