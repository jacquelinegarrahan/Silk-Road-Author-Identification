				So as far as I can make out using localbitcoins &amp; doing a cash deposit is the best way to go. I can only see 3 sellers in the uk that will do that right now. <br />So, I choose one &amp; deposit the money.. I take it there&#039;s no way I can be scammed once i&#039;ve handed over the money, so long as I follow all the instructions &amp; use escrow etc.. right?<br /><br />Just want to make absolutely sure as i&#039;ve never done it before (obviously :/ )

				You are correct. Just make sure right before you make the deposit, that the transaction is still up in escrow and has not been canceled. I&#039;ve never had a problem with it but I could see some complications depositing the money in the account right after(for whatever reason) the seller cancels the transaction. You should receive your coins after you deposit and you provide the seller with the transaction ID on the receipt you&#039;re given during the deposit at the bank.<br /><br />The escrow system works wonders on localbitcoins.<br /><br />Another note is increasing the anonymity using localbitcoins. Cash deposit is on the best ways to remain anonymous, but if you want to take it a step further, make sure to use a non personal email or account named used in any other personal matter in your life online. This will create more space between you identity and the bitcoins.<br />NOTE: Buying bitcoins is NOT illegal, but why not be a little more cautious with some effort?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Wish you the best of luck.

				I&#039;ve searched several places for this answer and cannot find it.....when I am arranging to buy bitcoins online, be through localbitcoins.com or coinbase, do I do it while under the Tor browser?&nbsp; I am pretty sure that I read on Mt Gox&#039;s site that they will not allow you to conduct a transaction while browsing their site with Tor....if I am remembering correctly.&nbsp; I have read so much in the past week, I could be wrong.&nbsp; I feel like this is a dumb question.&nbsp; Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to answer.

				If you are using your bank account already to receive bitcoins, Tor is useless.&nbsp; I would probably not use it as it might flag your account.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I believe I read that Tor should never be used on a site where personal information is used. (Don&#039;t log-in to your Facebook, gmail, etc.)

				You absolutely can use Tor for personally identifiable action, such as Facebook. <br /><br />But! You shouldn&#039;t do it during the same session as something else. If you check your Facebook, and at the same time check the SR, you risk having your IP connected to both.<br /><br />Bottom line: Using Tor for personal stuff is fine, but don&#039;t mix personal use and anonymous use at the same time (make sure you select &quot;New Identity&quot; each time).
