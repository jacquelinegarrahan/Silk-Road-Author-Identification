				I like to think I&#039;ve got pretty good willpower, I mean I don&#039;t drink and my diet is pretty good. So really if I spend a lot on nice powder I&#039;ll probably have it sparingly and make it last. But I do munch down a lot of random chems quite regularly so who knows.

				I usually order for a special occasion (or sometimes just the weekend) but the problem then is ordering in advance to make sure it arrives in time. If it arrives early the weekend often starts early as far as I&#039;m concerned.

				Pretty solid if it&#039;s just me who knows what I have, I start to falter when other people know and they suggest doing it. This is the worst with coke which leads me to make secret orders and not tell anyone I have it for a while.
