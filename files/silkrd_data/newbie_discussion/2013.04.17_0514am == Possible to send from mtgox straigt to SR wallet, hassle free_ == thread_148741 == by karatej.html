				As long as I do not use the tor browser while on mtgox, shouldn&#039;t it go straight through? <br /><br />I derped out before and was using tor while trying to transfer and they blocked it are reviewing my account. I plan on sending info to them for that account, use it as back up coins. Anyways, opened a NEW mtgox account and purchased coins NOT using tor this time. So as long as no tor, shouldn&#039;t this be a breeze now?

				From what i understand it is NOT safe to do that. The BTC was purchased I assume with your name? Use tumblr at the least before you deposit in SR. Im sure if you search the forums for tumblr you will find a lot of posts on the subject.

				I would advise against it. May aswell just put it into your wallet, then to silk instead of mtgox straight to silk.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t know for sure.

				Fuck Mt.Gox. Bitinstant gets your cash into an account that can be translated into btc.<br /><br />Go to bitinstant. Pick a place to send your cash. Go to that site and set up an account. READ THE RULES for transactions first. Use a fake name to establish account. Bitinstant is cheaper than bank wire transfers. I personally use virwox. You buy &#039;lindys&#039; that are then sold to buy bitcoin. Then I take those bitcoin and send them to another wallet/account somewhere else. From there I sent them to SR. May sound like a lot of bullshit, but it provides security and separation from the original transaction.<br /><br />This process takes an afternoon, but the end result speaks for itself.

				You could still use Mt Gox but transfer the bit coins to another trading site that allows anonymous accounts. Then transfer to a wallet or to SR directly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use cavirtex.com to do all my trading.

				I&#039;ve done what ozama suggested <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Go to bitinstant. Pick a place to send your cash.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> but directly into my SR account, which I change every deposit. If I were to add a middle acct like blockchain how is that more security?

				as long as you click the &quot;get a new address&quot; to change the address it is sent to after each transaction it should be fine. The main thing to worry about is security IRL.
