				I&#039;d be happy to try a sample, I came across your listings as I&#039;m looking for a vendor to purchase my next ounce from, still probably a month or so away (after my current stash), as the vendor I used last hasn&#039;t had any Cannabis listings up for awhile. Also happy to leave a review here.

				Here&#039;s my review of the vendor.<br /><br />Communication:<br />Initial message response time was within 1 hour. Very fast. This vendor does not speak in first person but exchanges with you on behalf of the vendor name. Meaning it appears this vendor takes pride in using proper English and grammar as a professional own-business.<br /><br />Postage and Stealth:<br />I received my sample the following day after submitting my information the previous night! The level of stealth is satisfactory for domestic shipping. Vacuum sealed, no odour whatsoever. My only nuance was the amount of stem in the sample size. From a 1 gram sample about 15% was stem the rest really vibrant bud.<br /><br />Product and Price:<br />Im not a fan of hydroponic cannabis. Previous bad experiences have put me off in the past. I made a single joint out of all of it and it did surprise me. I did like it.&nbsp; The best description is it like a sour rainbow coating your throat. I was buzzed by the halfway mark and it helped that I had a great view to look at with accompanying music. I can see at the moment (17-May) the vendor has 1z of the same product for ~$300. Price never bothered me to begin with as much as postal speed. I could never predict properly when I would need to order to keep my supply constant from International vendors. I have 100% peace of mind that my order will be delivered and on time. The price just adds to the cherry on top.<br /><br />My only advice for the vendor would to be to step up a little if they post internationally. Without going into detail, the outside appearance and touching it to make out the shape are the concerns.<br /><br />I will be ordering from this vendor again. Thank you QualityAUSurance.<br />
