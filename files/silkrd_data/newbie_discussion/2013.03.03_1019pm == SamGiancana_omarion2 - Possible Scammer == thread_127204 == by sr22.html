				For those of you who don&#039;t know SamGiancana has had a rough week.&nbsp; In the one month since he has joined SR Sam has been the victim of a home invasion robbery, then in one transaction managed to lose ~$7500 in bitcoins and 250g of methylone - not a good week.&nbsp; The latter was perpetrated by another SR Vendor TheTeflonDon who also has only been on SR for one month..<br /><br />In providing proof of the TheTeflonDon theft SamGiancana posted chat from his buyers account omarion2 of a chat omarion2 had with TheTeflonDon in this post http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126705.msg873241#msg873241<br /><br />This is the same omarion2 that SamGiancana quotes on his vendor page as a positive review of his methylone http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/08e98cf465<br /><br />&quot;After having a kilogram of methylone from samgiancana, and from DRG0NZO, samgiancana has the better methylone, reacts stronger on eztest and my guys who pick up from me are getting better feedback from his, but I still give g0nzos a 9/10! No complaints on this at all.&quot;<br />-omarion2 (written on drg0nzo 1 kg methylone listing)<br /><br />This did two things.&nbsp; First, it just burned SamGiancana&#039;s vendor account as anyone who omarion2 bought from can now identify SamGaincana.&nbsp; The more interesting thing is that SamGiancana uses a omarion2 quote (from a DrGonzo feedback) as positive feedback for his product.&nbsp; It seems really shady that a vendor would buy from a competitor and then tout their own product in the Feedback.&nbsp; It seems even shadier that the vendor would then quote themselves as a positive review of their own product.<br /><br />SamGiancana has only been here a month and has shown to be careless in real life (getting robbed where people knew exactly what they were looking for, sending bitcoins and giving product before getting any money) and on the Silk Road (by posting the name of the buyer account they use).&nbsp; What worries me is that now SamGiancana is getting a lot of FE transactions.&nbsp; This for a Vendor that has been active one month, probably hasn&#039;t even get a bond refund, and is obviously just not cut out for this business.&nbsp; Be careful SR and don&#039;t be surprised when SamGiancana disappears.

				and now he is trying to get cash for BTC because of his troubles along with the FE. Not saying I know he is a scam but it seems sketchy to me for all this to happen to a vendor who has been here a month. Hopefully this is not true.

				It does sound VERY sketchy ... but just sounding sketchy doesn&#039;t mean that it is, I guess ... only time will tell, and should tell pretty damn soon if people don&#039;t start reporting receiving their orders.
