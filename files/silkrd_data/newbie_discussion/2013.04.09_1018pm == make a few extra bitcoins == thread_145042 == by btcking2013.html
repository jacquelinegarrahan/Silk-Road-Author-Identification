				the price of mining high grade hardware is fucking expensive and alaso it can take forever to get a full BTC.....<br /><br />if you have really many money and want to invest in that .. why not, but with versability of BTC ....i would discourage to invest in mining hardware....<br /><br />And also put a &quot;CLEARNET WARNING&quot; on your links outside tor ...

				Even with a clearnet warning. I would not download anything linked in this forum. A watering hole attack is a very obvious risk. I&#039;m assuming the download is for a pdf, or some other document capable of hosting executable code. The attacker would know that anybody downloading it has an SR account, and likely has BTC in a wallet on their computer, or they regularly access accounts with BTC online. It could also be LE going on a fishing trip. Create a document that when opened pings, or sends some small amount of data to their server. Now they have an IP and can ask your ISP to let them monitor you. Or just put extra scrutiny on your mail. There is absolutely reason to mix illegal activity with anything else. When you are on a site that is used for illegal trade YOU DON&#039;T FUCKING DO ANYTHING ELSE!<br /><br />If you break that simple rule, and that results in misfortune...too bad. It&#039;s not very hard to take common sense precautions. Scammers need people to scam, and police need people to lock up. While both do happen to good people who do take the necessary precautions, at least when it&#039;s because of a stupid mistake, it gets rid of stupid people who make everyone else less safe.

				Well the idea of mining for bit coin was a good idea back when sr first started. Now it is a better idea to buy bit coin and let them fester in your own wallet and then use them when the value for them has sky rocketed to either sell them for a nice profit or buy some shit off SR and get to slanging<br /><br />There is already loads of bit coin minors who already have the latest technology in equipment. Unless you have a cool million to invest in equipment then you will not be able to make shit with bit coin mining. Plus it&#039;s a lot more viable to set up shop somewhere where it&#039;s cold climate year round so you can be efficient by using the heat produced by your rig to heat your building. If you set up in the warmer climate areas then you will lose out because of your electric bills
