				quite frankly I am finding this to be a pain in the ass, but as long if it cuts down on spam i am fine with it. I just wish that I had better internet as I actually have to drive to get any decent internet that isn&#039;t blocking tor a further pain in the ass

And no one notices spam b/c always cleaned up around the clock. If you are here at right time, you&#039;ll see the spam like a virus, it is that quick. Goes from nothing to viral in an instant. <br /><br />But this is only very, very rare. (What, once a day or two?) As for why we have the rule in first place, well, answered a million times lol.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.

But, WTF, it&#039;s a small price to pay to travel down this awesome road. I will probably join in as so many others have, with many posts containing possible shallow words of wisdom to become a junior member. <br /><br />OMG - just got an awesome rush from PP&#039;s pure cola, 15 minutes after snorting - maybe it&#039;s drip, but wow!

				Ah, so it&#039;s to stop the BTC scammers?&nbsp; That makes sense, I figured it was some tactic to frustrate LE.&nbsp; Though really, if we can spam our way to 50 I guess they can too.

				on the upside though those who were just doing it to casually screw with us now have a barrier instead of being able to spam all across the boards can now only spam this one...unless they are really dedicated they could but others will lose interest pretty quick
