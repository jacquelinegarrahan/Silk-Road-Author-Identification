				Posting this in the newbie forum as i&#039;m pretty sure its a noob question.<br /><br />So, my latest purchase seems to have gone a bit south. Is it best to hit this immediately, now its available - or should I wait until the last day as a courtesy to my usually faultless vendor? <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to cause any offense or inconvenience the vendor as I use them quite a bit, and they have always been great, until this order.<br /><br />I was in contact several days ago, and asked to re-supply my PGP for re-postage. Seems like it was just a human error (there were two parts to the order and I think they just forgot one i think). <br /><br />Anyway, haven&#039;t heard back since I did that, and despite the vendor logging in every day, the couple of messages I sent are sitting unread. <br /><br />I have 6 days left until AF, is there any harm in holding off until the last day, or are you meant to hit it right away?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help folks.

				You should take your order to resolution after around 10 days (ish) depending on where you are ordering from/to, international orders can obiously take a lot longer than that to arrive. You should also be opening a dialogue with the vendor to see what they have to say, if the first instance I would normally request an extension on the finalize date, just clicking on resolve adds 5 days anyway. <br /><br />Keep your communications factual and non emotive, this will help you work things out. There is nothing vendors hate more than irate buyers posting inflammatory accusations, it will also guarantee you getting branded a scammer or buyer to avoid in the vendor roundtable. <br /><br />Hope that helps.

				It&#039;s upto you. There&#039;s nothing that says you can&#039;t wait until the last day, and as you say you&#039;ve have used this vendor many times before with no issue, I would personally give them the benefit of the doubt. <br /><br />Unread messages are very frustrating, but you simply don&#039;t know what the issue is.<br />When did the vendor last log-in?<br /><br />Even if you do hit resolve, that needn&#039;t be the end of it. You can request a refund, a re-send, OR you can simply extend the delivery period.<br /><br />If this was a one-time purchase from a previously un-used vendor then I&#039;d say go for resolve. But, as you&#039;ve had a working relationship with this vendor for a while, I&#039;d give them every chance to make it right.<br /><br />Message them again, see if there are any other points of contact on their vendor profile ie. tormail, and search the forums to see if anyone else is having issues.<br /><br />But to answer your question; No. There&#039;s no rule that says you have to click resolve the day it becomes available.

				Thanks a ton for that everyone. Really helpful.<br /><br />Samesame - Yeah I definitely am not feeling emotional about it haha, so no worries there. I do trust the vendor, but obviously something is up - as my messages simply aren&#039;t being read. <br /><br />Hes logging in every day - but for all I know he could be unwell and someone is logging in to keep him out of vacation mode...&nbsp; its happened before. Really would rather just wait for as long as it takes, as you say - I would like to give the benefit of the doubt for sure, as I definitely trust the vendor, so whatevers happening it isn&#039;t malicious or intentional im sure .. but the last thing I need is an auto-finalize so I&#039;ll have to do something in the next few days either way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158449.msg1118382#msg1118382">Quote from: Libertas on May 12, 2013, 11:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Leaving an order &#039;til the last day is highly inadvisable for a number of reasons, one of which is in case you have login issues (meaning that your order would auto-finalise and hurt your stats), and another is that the vendor will be expecting the payment at the end of day 17.

I&#039;ll hit it tomorrow evening then if nothing happens (it is the weekend after all), and just get some extra time. There is no rush on the order anyway so im pretty flexible as long as it works out in the end.<br /><br />I love this place, it seems like when anyone asks a question about 6 people come to the rescue instantly... so thanks!

				I am too, going to have to enter my first resolve shortly... seems I have been unlucky, the vendor is one that seemed to be working perfect for everyone, until suddenly he run into some problems... my order took 7 days from processing to in transit (some of that time, true, might be due to the attack we suffered), but then 11 more days have gone and nothing showed up, the vendor hasnt logged in for the last 5 days, has no active listings...<br /><br />I hope I&#039;ll be able to ask for a full refund in this case, since it seems most of the orders marked as in transit the last days he was here have not arrived either. Sucks a bit, so far everything had been real smooth for this happy noob!!

				I&#039;m in a similar scenario. It took over a week to be &quot;in transit&quot; and now its been a week since. This is a domestic order that should be here by now. I&#039;m going to give him the benefit of the doubt but if I don&#039;t get it in the next couple days I&#039;m definitely messaging him and if I don&#039;t get a response I will move to resolve.
