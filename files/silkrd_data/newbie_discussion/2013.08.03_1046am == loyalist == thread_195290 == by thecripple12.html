				never FE that is the oldest and most successful scam in the books...there&#039;s more vendors in the sea that will take better care of you if you do enough research and dont jump the gun on ordering.

				Ive used loyalist a few times with no issues. I currently have another order for his oil that has not shown up and also some paki black, and he is not responding to any coms. I can see a message that has now been up several days about delays from lack of vacum bags.<br /><br />He made me FE my first order and has not asked me too since. I am a little concerned with the feedback and lack of coms, however I do know this guy does deliver, and has a pretty good rep. My money is on stock problems, he appears to just be sitting tight at the moment, im not convinced about the vac seal statement hes put up myself, but I cant go into why really on the forums...<br /><br />This is going to be a sit tight situation im afraid, I have some faith he will come good on all his orders I really do, hes not going about it the right way but most these damm vendors never do.<br /><br />If its your first order it sucks, its not the best intro to the road in general, I had a delayed first order myself, been there! But I think you get this eventually people. I will keep an eye on this thread myself and update with anything I hear, or if I get my 2 orders :)<br /><br />
