				Title: <strong>MDA???</strong><br />

				So I bought some MDA for the first time and tested it out with a buddy, thinking it was pretty much the same thing as MDMA. We each took .1, and agreed that we had never rolled as hard as that off of .1 of anything, ever. A couple weeks later we did some more, but this time we upped the dosage.....around .2, and I swear to god I was seeing shit running around the floors. My buddy told me something about seeing the alphabet written on the floor. I just laughed and kinda shook it off as a first experience type of deal. Then, on Friday I was rolling with a bunch of my friends, and right before I left to their place I happened to find about .4 of the MDA in my safe. Once their, I took .2 of MDMA, and right around feeling it I took the MDA. During the night, I saw black writing in the walls and at one point, I&#039;m pretty sure that everybody was wearing black and white face paint. They kinda looked like clowns, but with black and white faces. There was a strobe light and a black light on, which obviously had some kind of effect, but regardless it was crazy....and awesome. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences with this stuff. I almost feel like if MDMA sexed up LSD and they had a drug baby, it would be MDA. Hmmm.....

				I&#039;ve never tried MDA, but I&#039;ve smoked DMT a few times and I found it awesome.<br /><br />The visuals and colors were absolutely incredible. It was amazing even with your eyes closed!!

				I think i&#039;ve tried DMT one time....thats the shit that tastes like burning rubber right??? Wasn&#039;t too fond of it. It only lasted like not even 10 minutes. MDA is waaaaaaayyyy better in my opinion.

				Now you&#039;ve got me interested. I&#039;ll order some MDA when Silk Road is back online! :)<br /><br />By the way, MuddbuttJenkins, have you seen your ID number on this forum?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=66666<br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting number, to say the least! ;)

				MDA makes you hallucinate, that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; I&#039;ve closed my eyes and watched the fish swimming around :)

				^^^EXACTLY!!! I saw shapes when I closed my eyes. It reminded me of an acid trip. But yeah I would give it a shot for sure. I would recommend The ILF, but they have since closed up shop.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can get some elsewhere, but it is definitely worth trying.

				many years ago that shit got me kicked out of drug club for being too high.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even realize that was possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently I had short chat with a cop too while I was high (fortunately I had a sober friend looking out for me at the time.)&nbsp; Crazy shit for sure.

				I&#039;ve always wanted to try the pure stuff, though i&#039;ve heard it&#039;s more neurotoxic than MDMA.<br /><br />Whats the biggest difference between street tabs/ex and pure molly? Is it a lot less hallucinatory/speedy and more euphoric?

				Im pretty sure all tabs are just MDMA with some sort of filler but some tabs off the street can contain anything from meth to caffeine. MDMA is just the powder, so it is usually more pure than tabs, provided it isn&#039;t cut with anything...

				If you get good tabs that only contain MDMA and inactive filler then you&#039;ll roll the same as you would on the same amount of molly that is just MDMA.&nbsp; Most molly sold on the street in the US is not MDMA.

				Yes most molly sold on he streets is far from MDMA and its disguting in my opinion.&nbsp; Past few 18+ shows i&#039;ve been to i&#039;ve seen so many young high school kids on meth, and other unfavorable stims they thought were molly.&nbsp; So sad to see, and almost upsetting.<br /><br />However in regard to MDA, yes it is amazing.&nbsp; I love combing MDMA and MDA in the same experience.&nbsp; They compliment you so much.&nbsp; The MDA keeps you super visual and trippy as well as rolling very hard, and the MDMA keeps you from falling over/sitting down on MDA.&nbsp; It is like a religious experience in your mind.&nbsp; Your dosage is very high however.&nbsp; MDA is very potent when compard to MDMA.&nbsp; I rolled off of .05 of the ILF&#039;s MDA, and i weigh 180 lb&#039;s.&nbsp; Through person exeprimentation ive found that the best dosage combo of MDMA/MDA for me was (.10 MDMA/ .075 MDA), later boosted with (.025 mdma/.025 mda) capsule.&nbsp; It was a fantastic time and i was in love with everything and everyone.&nbsp; Ladies love the sass...qoute it
