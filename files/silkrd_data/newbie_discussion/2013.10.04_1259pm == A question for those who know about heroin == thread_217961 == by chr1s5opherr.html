				Apologies for posting in the wrong forum, but I dont have enough posts to post anywhere else yet.<br />If a mod could move it that would be great.<br /><br />Anyway this might seem kind of a stupid question but I am farily inexperinced with heroin and want to make sure and stay on the side of caution.<br />Ive tried ita few times now but every time I use I smoke tiny amounts at a time until I get to the desired level just to make sure I dont have to much.<br /><br />So heres my question....<br /><br />Just assume my heroin is totally pure witch obviously its not but just assuming it is, say 20mg is how much I need to smoke to get me to as high as I want to be, Well is it any more dangerous to smoke this 20mg all at once than to do it in tiny amounts of the period of say an hour, as I really want to experince the rush but am currently being too careful to smoke that much at once.<br /><br />also Does anyone know how long heroin stays active in your system for, I dont mean for drugs testing but again just assuming 50mg would be an od for me and kill me and I had taken 45mg all at once, How long would I have to wait to be safe to take a further 10mg without going into od ?<br /><br />Thanks for any help guys.<br />I hope everyone is doing good after the last week.

				thanks for the replys, I appriciate its pretty hard to OD when smoking im just kinda nervous as I guess its such a fine line with heroin and everybody is different. <br />Are there signs you can look for in yourself to know when you have had enough ? <br /><br />people say dry mouth, clamy hands, pinpoint pupils etc indicate an OD but these are all symptoms I get from a good hit lol

				...almost no pupils, blueish skin, slow/weak breath... <br /><br />...to be completely honest with you, knowing many dead junkies, dead ex-junkies (suicide &#039;cause life lost its importance), and even more walking dead ones, oldboys living in the parents basement or in a looney bin... h is not a good drug to do. there are better ones, more social ones, less lethal and less life-changing ones. I love opiates, in general, but I stick to the milder ones, h is just too... it takes total control off you, and I prefer to be (able to at least pretend I&#039;m) in control! <br /><br />...what a rant that turned out to be... sorry.<br /><br />/ jesus mode off :)

				as an ex addict of 14 years, after ending up in Prison for a year, nearly loosing my kids and family, Id say youve had enough before you even begin! :S<br /><br />But if you are gonna use, remember every batch is different, ALWAYS test a small amount first. ALWAYS make sure you are somewhere safe when using, and with people you TRUST will not just leg it if you do OD.<br /><br />You will fall asleep or vomit before you OD smoking, injecting however is not the same and is playing russian roulette every single time you do it,&nbsp; my advice, it might be nice now once every now and then, but soon it isnt nice and your just taking it to feel normal, not get a buzz!<br /><br />Goodluck bro!
