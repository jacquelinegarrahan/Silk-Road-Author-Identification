				I realize that this may be a total newbie question so I apologize in advance but like my teachers always said - ask the question and the chances are it has been asked before and someone experienced and knowledgeable can help you out :)<br /><br />I finally took the plunge -(after being a sideliner for about 6 months) and decided to buy from a well known and trusted vendor according to friends and fellow SR users alike, But I have a query/concern.<br /><br />The vendor I have ordered with has been online been online since I placed the order but has left mine in &#039;Processing&#039; it&#039;s been over 36 hours and it hasn&#039;t changed. <br /><br />Is this normal?<br /><br />How long does an order ususallly stay in &#039;Processing&#039; for? (I know it&#039;s just turned to the start of the week - probably I have first purchasers jitters and + I really need this to come through soon).<br /><br />Anyways all thats the end of my rant! I&#039;m not trying to make anyone look bad (Clearly since I haven&#039;t named anybody~) maybe I just need reassurance :)<br /><br />Thanks for your time in advance<br /><br />WWW

It is also possible that your vendor requiers you to FE, due to you buyer statistics.<br /><br />These are things that you should look up before you order, so always read the info on the vendors page.<br /><br />If none of this applies I would wait another 2 days and then contact the vendor.

				I have 3 orders all sitting in processing, I assume they don&#039;t ship on weekends and rather than mark it in transit, they are waiting until it&#039;s actually shipped.<br /><br />I wish the road would add a status, &quot;Ordered&quot;, then Processing after the vendor has viewed your order, then In Transit once they have shipped.

				Thanks Sleep ~ I&#039;ve read his profile and it advises that he PM if F.E is required so I guess I&#039;ll just need to wait it out for a little while, I didn&#039;t want to be one of those first time ever buyers who was contacting the vendor every 5 seconds about stuff so thanks for making me feel a little at ease :)<br /><br />Also thanks for reply to my first every post - made my day, night or whatever time it is here&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />WWW

				Just have some patience! I have usually found that most sellers mark the item as in transit in 1-3 days. I believe that if it is still showing in process after 4 days, you have the option to cancel your order.

				I know what its like brother trust me waiting for that first order. Checking the SR every few hours to see if its marked in transit. I was so sure I got ripped off and on the fourth day of my order book it was there and it was beautiful. <br /><br />Truth is if you went with a good vendor with a decent rep and you gave the right address your good. I like many have had many good experiences and can honestly say only one bad (should&#039;ve looked closer at vendor reviews).<br /><br />&nbsp;The hardest part is to sit back and wait for it to come, try not to think about it.

I have to say I agree, It&#039;s like a holiday when your package makes it to your mailbox safely.
