				dont know exactly how it would work for a abd trip. seeing as ive never had one, ive always kept set and setting at mind and when a trip starts going bad i say to myself&quot; its the drugs fucking with your head&quot; and i manage to turn it around to a good trip., but i do know from experience, if your on an acid trip. a nice line of pure cocaine will sober you right up., i got hard on lsd one night(25-30 hit) tripped hard, ate 6 at once at 6am and realised i had court at 9am for production of marijuana when i got caught street dealing( since moved to silkroad where its safe) did a nice big rail of cocaine, and just sobered off my acid trip and went to court with nothing more than paranoia

				What drug were you on or are you on?<br /><br />Also please don&#039;t mix cocaine and acid, mixing such a strong dopamine agonist with a serotonin agonist will only end in brain pain.<br /><br />Benzos are basically your only option, if you have none ride the trip out.

				I usually just listen to a good vibes song; it&#039;s very difficult to be unhappy while listening to Bob Marley, Beatles, or whatever your favorite music is. And as said before weed helps a lot too. But mainly I just realize that I&#039;m in a drug-induced state and that I purposely paid for and took this drug for fun, so I try to have some!
