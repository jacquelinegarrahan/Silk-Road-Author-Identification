				Hi,<br />I found a vendor that has some inventory I want but I have a question. Usually I like to see a vendor around at least a few months 5/5 rating and some reviews from buyers with high stats so I can feel comfortable they&#039;re not shill reviews/buyers. <br /><br />Now this vendor has 5/5 rating, been on SR for 8 months and completed 34 transactions with 19 positive reviews. Trouble is the most recent review is 3 months old and all the stats are hidden (old system). Would you feel comfortable ordering? <br /><br />Any ideas appreciated.

				I personally only buy from vendors who have both large amounts of transactions, positive reviews, AND numerous recent comments (preferably that same day).<br /><br />I mean, it could be fine. But why not find someone who has all three.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ll immediately turn down any vendor who requires ANYONE to FE, even newbies.

I would search the entire forum for his name first though. If you don&#039;t find anything negative, it might work out OK. I&#039;ve done it without problems (not guaranteeing that you will be OK).<br /><br />Read through all the reviews and make sure they&#039;re not a bunch of FE&#039;s. If nothing seems fishy about them, then go with your gut. My instinct has never been wrong here, although I&#039;ve chosen to disregard it a couple of time. I was fortunate enough to have those orders cancelled though.<br /><br />I like the old feedback system better personally.<br /><br />EDIT: If you&#039;re buying something like pills, you may find several vendors that have large gaps in their vending stats. If it were weed, I wouldn&#039;t buy from them. But there are a lot of good weed vendors. There aren&#039;t a ton of good adderall venders though&nbsp; ;D

				Yeah they sells pills and H so maybe the pill supply&nbsp; is hit/miss.<br /><br />They have what I need and at a good price (40% lower than anyone else) but hasn&#039;t been active in 3 months. What do they say&nbsp; if it&#039;s too good to be true.......<br /><br />Most of the reviews are for H with a few mentions of FE. I never FE and vendor page doesn&#039;t suggest it either.

Other than that looks legit.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly. The pill vendors sell their supply, disappear for a while and then come back. It sucks for them because it causes them to fall down in the rankings for not generating sales.<br /><br />One thing though: please be careful with anyone claiming to sell H here. H vendors are the ones I&#039;ve seen the most scam complaints about; I&#039;m not sure if they are scammers or if they&#039;re just dealing with a bunch of crazy junkies (probably a little of both). Like I said, trust your gut and don&#039;t talk yourself into making a dumb choice.<br /><br />If they ask you to FE, just say no. They should cancel your order. That&#039;s the first sime of a scammer; it&#039;ll say nothing on their page about FE, but you&#039;ll get an email from them asking you politely if you wouldn&#039;t mind FE&#039;ing. Don&#039;t fall for that.
