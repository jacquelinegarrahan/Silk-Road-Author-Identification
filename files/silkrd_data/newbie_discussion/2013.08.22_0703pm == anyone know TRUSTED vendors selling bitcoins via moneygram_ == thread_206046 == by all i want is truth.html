				Go to localbitcoins.com. There are lots of vendors using every conceivable type of payment method, including WU and moneygram, and even better, anonymous cash bank deposits. There is a rating system showing how many transactions they&#039;ve completed, and their feedback rating (obviously don&#039;t use anyone who doesn&#039;t have perfect feedback). It&#039;s been the go-to site for a lot of folks here for awhile, and haven&#039;t heard of anyone getting scammed so far. I&#039;ve used many different sellers and had only stellar results. This site is generally much faster than exchanges, much more private and imo much safer than buying from someone on the forums.

				This may be the wrong place to ask, but maybe someone can point me in the right direction. Totally new to bitcoin and I need to know the best way (privacy, etc.) to set up my first bitcoin wallet. This information about where to buy bitcoin is helpful. I just need to know how to get my wallet. Every option I&#039;ve looked at can be traced back to me somehow, through email or whatever. Like I said, I know nothing. Any help is appreciated.

				Your SR account comes with a wallet.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just me but I thought it was a huge pain to try and get anything from the bitcoin exchanges.&nbsp; I find it easiest to research the vendors who are selling bitcoin on SR and make a purchase on there.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need to give them your wallet address, assuming you want the bitcoin sent to the account that your ordering from.&nbsp; Find a good vendor and you should have the coins in your account in hours

				I don&#039;t know if this counts as a review since the order never wnt thru, but...<br /><br />A few days ago I sent a moneypak to ThaMiddleMan. A few hours later I realized I needed that money for bills and messaged him to cancel the order. He had the numbers at that point and couldve took the money n run but didn&#039;t. I&#039;ll be getting my btc from him in the future for sure.<br /><br />Thats my only firsthand recommendation.

				Thanks, rwitherspoon. If I understand you correctly, I don&#039;t need a third-party wallet. But what if I buy from localbitcoin.com as some suggest? Won&#039;t I need to provide a wallet address there that isn&#039;t linked to SR?
