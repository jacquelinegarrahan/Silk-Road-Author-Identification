				Help! a vendor sent tar in itty bitty jar--How can I get this out?&nbsp; I stuck in my pocket and when I opened it again it was wet and stringy on the lid--I&#039;m kind of at loss here---ANYBODY ran in to this yet or knows how to get it out??? Please let me know---I can&#039;t even check weight to help confirm who this may be from.&nbsp; I have powder out there (unless a dealer changed his/her product) and haven&#039;t ordered tar real recently--however I have had to go to resolution for the first time on 2 orders from the same day--Any serious ideas would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you!

				Try breaking the freaking thing. I don&#039;t believe there is anything that could get between me and some good tar no matter how strong it was if i held it in my hand. Try taking a hammer to it.

				put it in the freezer and then gently tap it with a tack hammer to loosen it?<br /><br />tbh, I have no idea but if it is liquid at room temperature then it should freeze easily..&nbsp; or not<br /><br />good luck :)

				Put it in the freezer for a few hours until the tar solidifies...<br /><br />Then take it out of the freezer once its completely frozen and smash the little plastic vial apart with a hammer or something... then you will be able to peel the tar off the plastic in one clean piece if you do it quick enough. It&#039;s important you take it out only once its completely frozen, and then immediately smash it open and peel it out... if it gets too warm from being at room temperature or from you handling it, it will begin to melt back into the sticky mess it originally was. Time is critical here.<br /><br />I dunno about heroin, but I make hash oil from time to time, and I use the freezer method with hash oil as its extremely sticky and messy..
