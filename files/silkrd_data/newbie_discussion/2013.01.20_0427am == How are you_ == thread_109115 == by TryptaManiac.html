				Not too bad, A bit pissed at finding out well respected members are fighting and trolling each other At first glance You could be forgiven for thinking your on Tumblr or some other such poppycock trolling site.<br />I though people where educated and civilized ? Also I&#039;m far from happy paying Â£12 pound for a BTC and then finding after post an pack I&#039;m paying double the odds for convenience. If the naysayers are correct and we all are sitting ducks <br />of the larger net spread by L/E and SOCA, It&#039;s all very depressing. I have full faith in DPR to stay ahead of the game. though, it&#039;s a hard road

				Good to hear most everyone is doing well!&nbsp; Thanks to all of you for responding to the post and especially to those of you who participated in the poll.&nbsp; I took delight in the many people who chose the third option, which was &quot;good and bad being social constructs&quot; (they truly are folks!).&nbsp; <br /><br />To those of you asking how OP is doing, I&#039;ve seen better days.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going through some minor skirmishes with one of my roommates.&nbsp; I keep using his shit, mainly his smoking devices (a bowl and globe) with good intentions, but end up &quot;tainting&quot; them.&nbsp; I dabbed DMT on his globe when he was away for winter, and used one of his $60 bowls to smoke weed/tobacco.&nbsp; He flipped his shit and busted in my room yelling at me come 10am the other morning, startling me awake.&nbsp; Instances like these are hard but I sense they help one grow if handled appropriately.&nbsp; When one starts getting too far into a reactant state, always succumbing their emotions instead of being mindful of them, relationships can get ugly.<br /><br />Also, I got scammed by TabMonster the other week, that bastard! I never should have FE&#039;d.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting on a strip from LucyDrop though, that should be good.
