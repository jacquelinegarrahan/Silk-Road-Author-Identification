				Finalize Early. It means releasing your funds to the vendor before they ship your order.<br /><br />Never FE. There are counter arguments against this but in the end it&#039;s the safest thing you can do to prevent being scammed.

				To add to this, vendors usually make new buyers with little to no transaction history FE in order to protect themselves from potentially being scammed. I suggest if you are new to silkroad to do your research on potential vendors who you want to do business with before ever Fe&#039;ing with them. Lowers your risk if it is a reputable vendor

				As a new customer you&#039;ll have to FE with some vendors. There are vendors that don&#039;t require FE for newbies though, you might want to search them out if the extra cost is worth the peace of mind

				FE is an acronym for &quot;Finalize Early.&quot; This is the action in which you release the funds in escrow to a vendor BEFORE your product is shipped or received. Avoid finalizing early at all costs!

				The Golden Rule: Never finalize early, no matter what. Some vendors may require it for new sellers, but purchasing from that vendor is your choice. I&#039;ve been here a long time and have seen so many people get scammed by finalizing early.

				Everyone says not to FE, but tons of buyers are FEing and getting their product just fine. They say so in the reviews. unless they&#039;re faked...<br /><br />I FE&#039;d on an order from Frank Matthews and I got what I wanted just fine. you just gotta find the trustworthy vendors.

				I don&#039;t mind FE for trusted vendors who I know are not scammers while I&#039;m a noob. However if I was asked to FE after 10 orders I just wouldn&#039;t bother with that vendor.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t ever FE for a vendor who didn&#039;t have a near perfect reputation and lots of customers.<br /><br />Really though it is best to avoid FE like people say

				I generally avoid FE, only do it with trusted vendors, and even then I avoid it I think most of their sales are FE, if that is the case that is a warning sign. Even if they do ship out they will probably be slow, and the incentive is for them to make a quick coin grab and disappear. I will never ask for FE for domestic, and thats all I am doing for now.
