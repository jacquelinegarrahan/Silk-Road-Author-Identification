				Title: <strong>International mail - red flag?</strong><br />

				Probably not the best post for the n00b forum but I was wondering if anyone here has experience with how often they order contraband internationally to the US and how their success rate has been.<br /><br />Specifically, I&#039;m wondering how often you can order stuff from known &quot;source&quot; countries like The Netherlands or Spain before raising red flags with the USPS. I&#039;ve gotta think, especially in this day and age, with data and analytics so readily available, that law enforcement is paying close attention between the correlation between illegal shipments, mail patterns, origin countries, package type, etc. For example, a guy who doesn&#039;t normally get any international mail who all of a sudden starts getting random envelopes from Holland is preeetty likely to be buying drugs. The more busts that are made, the more powerful this data becomes.<br /><br />Of course, it&#039;s probably not worth the time for LE to track small packages, and obviously the volume of mail is enormous so the government would have to commit serious resources to tracking this sort of data.

				Dealing with customs definitely ups the risk factor of the package being intercepted. It is still entirely possible to achieve a successful international shipment, but I do believe it is less risky to stick to domestic sources. As you say, if you start getting a bunch of international packages when you have never before, that would seem awfully suspicious to me.
