				HEY there fellow roaders I&#039;m new to the forum but not new to SR but now I have a problem and need to ask the sr community for help. so in the year that I have been buying on the road I have had 73 flawless transactions until now. I placed an order for a sample with sammyjankis and today I get a call from one of my drops saying they got a letter and an empty package from USPS and USPIS notifying them that there package was being held by the USPIS because of the controlled substance act and it pretty much said they have tried to contact the sender but were not able to and that if they wanted to go claim their package they could call the USPIS in Denver. WTF? this is a first for me and my people want to know what if anything will happen to them? oh and they said they had to sign for the empty envelope.

				Greetings Dave&nbsp; :+)<br />Lets analyze this.<br />Empty box ,official letter ? ,had to sign,come pick up goods.<br />Seems to me like something you might want to stay away from,especially <br />If the letter looks gov. official&nbsp; and&nbsp; the empty box was delivered by a real postman.<br />All things considered your luck so far has been good.<br />Think everything thru completely and make a logical choice.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />&nbsp; The Traveler&nbsp; <br />

				&nbsp; Hey :) Sounds like you got lucky! Place enough orders and eventually one is going to get intercepted. You were smart enough to have a layer of security buffering you and it paid off. The people at the drop just need to play dumb if any further contact from leo, obviously no clear evidence of wrongdoing or they&#039;d have had a swat team visit not a friendly letter.

				I&#039;d just let it go. I remember getting a very similar letter once when importing 100g of DXM, and when I plucked up the courage to follow up (DXM wasn&#039;t controlled then) it turned out they just wanted me to pay the import tax. Didn&#039;t even ask about my cough or anything.<br /><br />These days, your lucky to get a letter - it just doesn&#039;t turn up. Bet postal service christmas parties are a sight to behold.

				Yeah, always best to use real return addresses.<br /><br />A couple of vendors I&#039;ve used have made their deliveries look like they are from real world businesses - much easier then to slip through the proverbial net.<br /><br />For obvious reasons I&#039;m not going to give more details...

				Thurgood was also sketchy and asked his customers to FE on large transactions so he could then take that FE money and go buy the weed to send to you.&nbsp; I would never ever give my money to a vendor like that.&nbsp; <br /><br />VENDORS, ESPECIALLY ones in MJ source states need to take this as a WARNING and STEP UP their STEALTH!&nbsp;

				I was reluctant to order off vendors from Colorado or California before, and I&#039;m even more scared now.&nbsp; The last order I made, I didn&#039;t know where they were located, except that they were &quot;domestic&quot; to the USA.&nbsp; Luckily it didn&#039;t come from either of those two states.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard that Washington state is under watch.&nbsp; Hell, how long before the number of states under watch exceed the number of states not under watch?
