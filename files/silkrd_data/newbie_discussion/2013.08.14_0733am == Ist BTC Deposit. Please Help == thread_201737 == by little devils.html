				I am new to Silk Road and can&#039;t wait to get cracking. I&#039;m not familiar with BTC transactions, but under my limited knowledge I thought I could purchase BTC from a reputable exchange and give my SR wallet address and recieve my BTC. I have email confirmation of deposit from BTC exchange but no credit in my SR wallet??? It has been 6 hrs since deposit confirmation, how long can it take and or do I have to perform another step??? Please help.

				I always wait a night for my BTC to arrive in my wallet, I don&#039;t know how long the last one took but after Ã£bout 8 hours it was there. I&#039;ve deposited a lot of times, and so have others, don&#039;t worry, it will arrive within the next few hours. :)

				It can take a little time, usually an hour or so. 6 hours does seem like a long time. Where did you buy the BTC, are you able to check the progress of the transfer?

				I haven&#039;t had it take THAT long to get my deposit cleared to SR. <br />I get my BTC from one place, put it in a wallet, and then transfer to SR.<br />The SR step takes the longest by far, but I haven&#039;t had anything missing.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi :) Welcome to Silk Road, I hope you enjoy yourself here. The forums are chock full of tutorials.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not trying to be harsh, sorry if it comes across that way, but you really should have spent more time educating yourself before jumping in. Sending coin directly to SR isn&#039;t safe. You&#039;ve unnecessarily increased the risk to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s not illegal to buy btc, of course, but this place you&#039;ve bought the coin from knows where you&#039;ve sent your coin. I hope you didn&#039;t give them any identifying information, like your real email address? If the cops find drugs in your mail and can prove you recently bought coin and sent it to a .onion wallet it makes their life very easy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s a little tutorial I wrote for another user. It gives you an idea of how to get your coin to SR anonymously. Only buy bitcoins from sellers that allow you to do it completely anonymously over the tor network.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ensure that who/where you purchased coins from doesn&#039;t have any trace of your identity. You can then create a couple of online wallets, each from different providers, always using tor and switching identities at each stage. Jump your coin through the wallets and then onto SR, spend with confidence :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For example <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log onto tor<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site A and create anon throwaway wallet 1, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit online bitwallet site B and create anon throwaway wallet 2, record the password, username, wallet address<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Visit localbitcoins.com<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase coins anonymously from vendor. Once released into your localbitcoin wallet transfer to wallet 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Login to wallet 1 and transfer coin to wallet 2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into wallet 2 and transfer coin to SR wallet<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch tor identities<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Log into SR and wait for coin to hit, then create a new SR wallet address for future use. Never use those throwaway wallets again.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It takes a while to get your coin into SR, but 6 hours is a long time. Go to blockchain.info and put your SR wallet address in the search box and see if there&#039;s any record of the transaction.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be fine&nbsp; ;) Any problems post again. Happy shopping, Hitch.
