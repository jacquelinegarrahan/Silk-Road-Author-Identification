				I&#039;m just really frusterated Mtgox has been less than helpful when I emailed them for assistance. The verification email never hits my mailbox and yes I looked in spam. Currently there is no way to change your email address for your account not even customer service will do it for you. So I don&#039;t know how to fix this its a mess. That really pissed me off! Does anyone have any other suggestions getting desperate.

I had no smoke and phone was going crazy. It sucked. But I refused to use real info and get validated or wtf ever they want you to. So listen closely. Go ahead and log in with your normal account you have always used. <br /><br />All you have to do is go to add funds. Then click the option cash deposit and then click the option MTgox as your funding source. Then the amount. Next you will be taken to the next screen where they want your real info or it will not go through at all right? Well use real info just not your info. What I did was found someone on facebook that has there date of birth posted. Then used their name and date of birth. Then click sign in as guest and it should work. You still can use a fake address and phone number but make sure you give the clerk the same address and phone number! Then go to Walmart because they don&#039;t ID you. If they ask for ID just say sorry I don&#039;t have one. Hope I helped ya. I know the feeling man so I felt I needed to pass this on. Stay safe.

				Were getting off topic here yes I used my real info here&#039;s the prob. The verification email never made it to my inbox and yes i checked the spam. I can&#039;t verify my email no matter what I try and stupid Bitinstant doesn&#039;t have a way to change your email address not even through support. Can&#039;t get another account since my info is in the old one. I just want a way to trasfer cash into a bitcoin wallet and mtgox is pissing me off.

				Now, disclaimer as I&#039;m not 100% sure this is completely anonymous - but here is how I&#039;ve gotten my BTC to the road for well over a year.<br />https://www.virwox.com/[1] - It is a Second Life (the game) currency exchange. They offer MANY (paypal, wire transfer, etc...) ways to deposit cash into what are called Linden Dollars. This is the currency used in second life. After converting to Linden Dollars you can INSTANTLY transfer to BTC. After that all it takes is withdrawing BTC to your Silk Road Wallet. Entire process takes about an hour - and then your coins are in your wallet.<br />Let me know if it isn&#039;t the most secure form of making BTC deposits... but it has worked excellently for me for well over a year.
