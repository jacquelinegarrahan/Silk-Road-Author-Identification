				thats what ive been ive doing but its coming to the point its cheaper to buy off the locals then on sr ,and i know alot of ppl who are shying away from sr saying its preety much the same price as the streets so why risk post when i can get it from the guy down the road <br /><br />like i said if atlantis was reliable i would have jumped shipped by now , at the end of the day its buisness and risky and if the rewards arent there why risk , that the road i am on now

				Fees have tended to go up around here, not down.&nbsp; Atlantis is reliable and with very low fees but they don&#039;t have nearly as many customers.

				bling much respect as i feel you with all fees,expenses,and little profits after all. I thought sr took 10% but the totals your showing me are about 20%, i have done hedge but noticed one item was $80+ and after a month of non finalizing the funds came and do to hedging and increased btc rate i got $155 for my 80 item.<br /><br />So i guess its&nbsp; hedge game sometimes i wish i took the risk and didnt hedge as its going up but then again hedge has saved when it does fall:) its a gain,,,

				Seems like you are the only one with a problem, go to the vendor round table and discuss it there.<br />Yes seeing as i own and operate my own business i do know a bit about customer service probably morre then you evidently.<br />hedge charges like 25% did you read the fees? <br />I know i pay for shipping and i choose how much/what service express or normal look all vendors do
