				Title: <strong>Opening a P.O. Box with my friend, should we use his name for plausible deny?</strong><br />

				My question is in the second paragraph for TL;DR :)<br /><br /><br />To give a quick summary to our plan, and our current problem, we are going to be using The Road to flip weed. The prices of weed on The Road in comparison to where we live are ridiculously cheap. (To give you an idea, eighths are $60 where we live, compared to as low as around $25 if you buy in bulk off The Road) We&#039;ve got everything we need, from investment cash to our &quot;clients&quot;, so to speak. Where we hit a wall though is how we are going to send it. I&#039;ve done a fair amount of research on the use of P.O. Boxes for shipping and how well they tend to work. From what I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s not that sketchy of an option compared to shipping it to your home, or a friend&#039;s home. But, even with all the hours of reading, I still have a sort of specific question that deals with keeping us both as secure as possible from LE.<br /><br /><br />My friend does not have access to The Road, as he does not even have a computer or internet connection, and possesses nothing that would prove he had ever heard or seen of the site, which leads me to THE question: Would it be recommended for both of our safety if we use his name to open the P.O. Box in the case that a package is discovered and LE tries to follow a paper trail on him? I ask because if they do try to see where and how he&#039;s getting packages, they can&#039;t see that he&#039;s getting them from the internet. Would this be solid enough to argue plausible deniability? (&quot;I don&#039;t know who the fuck sent that package, but it wasn&#039;t me.&quot;) I&#039;m going to be the one doing all of the ordering and what-not, and have been for the last couple of months. My computer and ISP would be incriminating as fuck if it ever got to me, so my friend is a perfect alibi (I think!) to our problem. <br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t know exactly how LE would go about handling this, but I&#039;m certain that it wouldn&#039;t get to me, but I also want to make sure my friend isn&#039;t fucked over either, because he&#039;s actually a bro of mine, and his safety is just as important as mine. I think it&#039;s a non-issue overall in terms of him getting caught ever, as we are going to order strictly domestic, however I just want to be 100% certain, because we&#039;re going to be doing a lot of business in the near future. <br /><br />Any suggestions, critique, or help is much appreciated!!<br /><br /><br />

				Sorry I imagine people are confused because in the title there is a concise question but then the OP is a little long.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway I thought most vendors didn&#039;t use real address&#039;s for return addresses.&nbsp; If something doesn&#039;t make it then it goes to package heaven with all the other lost SR packages.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t used SR for very long but I get deliveries all the time, usually an average of 2 per week for more than 10 years now and not once has one gotten lost.&nbsp; When packages get lost I think they are addressed wrong or someone steals them.<br /><br />Anyway if you need to open a PO and you&#039;ve done your research then you know you have to do it legit.&nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t put another name as a receiver on the box and just make sure that the alternate receivers name is what you use for SR.

				Only your friend should check on the box.&nbsp; And don&#039;t tag along for the ride either.&nbsp; Season the PO Box for a few weeks/ month with useless shit.&nbsp; Free newsletters, AARP mailings, etc.&nbsp; Buy small ticket items from ebay and sent it to the box.&nbsp; Then gradually add SR stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				I&#039;ve been using a PO box for four months with no problems at all. I think your plan is completely safe.
