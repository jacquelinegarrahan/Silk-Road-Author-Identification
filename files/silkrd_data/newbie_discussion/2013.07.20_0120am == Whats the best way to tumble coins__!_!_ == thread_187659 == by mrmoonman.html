				Yeah that sounds like a good Idea, Guess im going to see what bitcoin fog is about. Ive heard blockchain.info can get subpeona&#039;d by LE whereas an E btc wallet can go about their business more anonymously. Thats why im interested what you kind folks do

				we have to use CLEARNET for tumbling coins/buying coins, for example have to use coinbase on CLEARNET and tumble also with CLEARNET?<br /><br />Or can we do this using Tor. <br /><br />Another thing, when I logged on to Tor browser today the homepage said there was an error and couldn&#039;t load, has this happend to anyone else?

				Yes use clearnet to buy and tumble coins if you buy using tor with your card no point in tumbling as then your card is linked to transactions through TOR. Buy tumble thend send on clearnet then go to TOR<br /><br />By homepage do you mean the congratulations you are using TOR page if so yes that has happened to me a few times normally just refreshing works but once i had to close and start again

				Yeah, thats the congradulations page i&#039;m talking about. I refreshed, same thing occurred, so than I just said fk it and went to SR. Hopefully it won&#039;t compromise anything. <br /><br />And thanks for answering my questions. <br /><br />Is a good way to mix coins on blockchain.info, to just send to a few different new addresses and then to SR?

				http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br /><br />According to theory, bitcoin tumbling (laundering) actually places bitcoins in a shared pool composed of a set of heavily protected bitcoin addresses (keypairs).<br /><br />The idea is that these keypairs prevent anyone from really being able to tell which coins going in are the same coins going out.<br /><br />To make this effective, a substantial pool of coins are kept, and coins going in AND out are supposed to be transacted in randomized smaller portions, in order to make keeping track a lot harder.<br /><br />It actually helps, if done right, because the bitcoin blockchain is public - anyone can read every transaction.<br /><br />The only anonymity you have is that it&#039;s sometimes not easy to make the connection between a random number and you.<br /><br />Using bitcoin over Tor, and using tumblers makes it damn near impossible, assuming the volks politzi don&#039;t physically raid your computers with the keys (&quot;addresses&quot;) on them.<br /><br />Tor relay servers are just as public and obvious as the Bitcoin blockchain, so understanding the limitations of the Bitcoin and Tor network designs is essential.<br /><br />These technologies are far from perfect.
