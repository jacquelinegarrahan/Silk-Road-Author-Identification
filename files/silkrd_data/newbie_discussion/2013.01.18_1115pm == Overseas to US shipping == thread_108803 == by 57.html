				I&#039;ve never ordered anything from out of the country before... legit or not legit.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering how it is sorted?&nbsp; So it comes in to a central location and is then sorted to state / city / post office?&nbsp; Do they just leave it in your box like a domestic letter, or do you always need to sign for an out of country shipment?

				I have ordered from Attitude seed bank before, It went to NY Inspection something or other and then came through, I was not home when my gift came but they left a note to sign for it. I got my phone out turned on my local police scanner on with a scanner app and walked into the post office with a earbud in. When he handed it to me he was like thats odd you did not have to sign for this. Just a little experience for you to draw from.

				There isn&#039;t much more but anecdotal evidence to support this but lets say your local postal carrier is your last chance to have your package seized assuming it doesn&#039;t get stolen also. For every layer you put on top of that you have an extra percent chance of that package getting found because there are more hands on it.<br /><br />In the end its sorted just like you imagine. All gathered and shipped to where ever on a plane most likely. All the packages removed then carted to their respective state by, truck?<br /><br />Unloaded into the sorting facility and carted to their local office. Brought to your door.<br /><br />For a &quot;legitimate&quot; package it won&#039;t matter how many people touch it unless it gets broken, you can use your insurance at that point.<br /><br />For other things? They have a printing press full of paper to send you a seething and vile passive aggressive letter about some contraband with your address on it that your crazy ex-girlfriend probably had sent to you because she hates you ;).

				I can&#039;t speak to how it is sorted. I&#039;d imagine it goes to a major city nearby for further disposition. <br /><br />You don&#039;t always have to sign for foreign packages. I didn&#039;t. They just left a package from the Netherlands in my box.

				I&#039;ve had several successful transactions, and I&#039;m afraid buying international is going to ruin my SR experience... If I get a love letter I&#039;ll have to find another drop location.&nbsp; How many people order internationally?&nbsp; What countries should I avoid purchasing from?

				The only one to really avoid is the netherlands, but even then the risk is pretty low if you read up on the&nbsp; vendor security. I got one package from the netherlands that without destroying the disguise you would never know anything was in it...
