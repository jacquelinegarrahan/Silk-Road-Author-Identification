				So after reading the forums for a week straight I realized how easy it is to get caught up with little do&#039;s and dont&#039;s in terms of Tor, PGP and OS kinda stuff. It seems like its pretty easy to lose perspective on the whole thing. <br /><br />Okay so we have a pretty good system in terms of the pork not being able to trace any online shit. But undoubtedly they&#039;re going to infiltrate using seller accounts. This is the only way they can take a few other sellers down. If the seller buys from another seller to resell and that seller is a fucking pig then BAM that&#039;s you done no? A seller gets done this way and so he can get less of a sentence he rats out sellers who buy to resell.... just like in RL. Another point: If you order 10-50gs of XYZ from overseas and that package gets caught- they have your name and your address, they follow your actions for a few days (before you know your package has been caught) and see that you&#039;re mailing a lot of shit. They open up the mail and BAM your fucked again. These are 2 relatively primitive ways of getting caught but they are big holes in the system. EDIT - Do the pork need a some kind of warrant to open things you&#039;ve put in the mail? Is getting shit sent to you that&#039;s obviously not for personal use enough to get this warrant? And WTF are odds of your package getting pulled when coming through customs if the seller has vacuum sealed and stealthed that shit?<br /><br />So I want to start selling, everything seems secure enough apart from this bullshit and I&#039;m really, really fucking over working so much, some people were truly made to do drugs and make art, keep healthy and fit and live life to the fullest. I just can&#039;t handle being a little slave any fucking longer and this is the safest way to deal but for reselling it does seem like its maybe has a few floors. Perhaps I&#039;ve missed something and I don&#039;t understand the encryption process. Any seller can see any buyers name and address no? And if he wants to keep a log he could no? Any pig can get check you out after seeing that 30gs of XYZ was being sent to you address. <br /><br />If you guys could chime in and tell me if I&#039;m missing something that would be great because If I can some how make this process really, really, really fucking hard to get caught then I will be a happy man. I&#039;ll probably try selling either way lol. The Silk Road is a fucking amazing community. I love it to bits. Such a wonderful idea. You know I heard some pig say that DPR was just using his philosophies *on how everybody has the right to ingest what they want to ingest and should have a safe way to do so* as an excuse to make a lot money but I know for a fact that he is like all of us and believes drugs should be legalized and regulated. This is his big fuck you to the powers that be and hes making some mullah at the same time, why not? He deserves every fucking cent.<br /><br />All input would be greatly appreciated! Much love brothers and sisters.

				Keep things separate. This does not exclude your name and address. If you buy anything from a vendor on SR ship it to a fake address (postbox) with a fake name (read up more on this, lots of pros/cons, but in my country it has never been a problem. If that is to much of a risk to you there are endless opportunities. Get stuff shipped to your neighbor and steal his mail. <br />If you for some reason choose to get stuff shipped to your own address you should never ever store the stuff there. <br /><br />I&nbsp; believe the SR and bitcoin system is as bulletproof as it gets, but you as a seller/buyer do have to take precautions. This is the basics. Getting the bitcoins transferred to your bank in a legit way is the hard part.<br /><br /><br />

				The keeping things separate is obvious but I read around and the general consensus is that you ship to yourself because there&#039;s still no proof you ordered it? And if the fuzz catch you taking the package from someones mailbox then you&#039;re truly fucked... Other issues like having to pick it up from the post office because for some reason it wasn&#039;t dropped at the mail box and not being able to provide ID to get the package. :/?

				I am sure many vendors have accounts for vending and for purchasing.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; You only have to pay for the vendor account so why risk not having both.&nbsp; I send stuff t my residence but will probably be getting a fake ID on SR to open a mailbox etc. account.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t think having your own name on the address is an issue because they still have to prove intent in order to charge you.&nbsp; Simply having a piece of mail arrive at your house doesn&#039;t make one guilty of what is inside.&nbsp; Intent is shown if they dupe you into signing for the package or something stupid like that.&nbsp; If you are put into that position, just tell them you were not expecting a package and refuse to sign for it saying you don&#039;t know who would have sent anything to you.&nbsp; If it is something small, most likely you will just get a letter saying that they destroyed contraband being sent to you.&nbsp; The Postal Service can&#039;t afford to keep their doors open, they definitely aren&#039;t going to be starting new and more stringent policies for petty stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				They have to see or have reasonable suspicion that you actually ordered the items.&nbsp; Otherwise your could send whoever you want to prison by sending them drugs, tipping the pigs off, and laughing as they get hauled off to the gulag.&nbsp; I guess what it comes down to is keeping your place squeaky clean in case they get a warrant and search your ass.

				@ Wadozo.&nbsp; Not trying to be argumentative with you since you clearly have been on SR much longer than I but assuming they were only finding the contraband via detection in transit, what legal grounds would they have for saying it was yours?&nbsp; I realize you would look absolutely guilty but they still have to build a case.&nbsp; I see no way in which a package that hasn&#039;t been in your possession prior, and is denied reception on grounds of not having been something you were expecting could be used as evidence to build a case.&nbsp; Laws might be different in other places in the world but we only need one juror to say they aren&#039;t 100% convinced of guilt.&nbsp; I&#039;m confident my attorney would have a case in that scenario dropped before he left his office.&nbsp; If you have specific case law that you could cite that would be much appreciated.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not trying to encourage this as the preferred way of shipping&nbsp; but I believe your statements may be overblown.&nbsp; If you could give us an explanation as to how you came to your opinion of plausible deniability being given up it would be greatly appreciated?&nbsp; I personally intend to have a mailbox soon under a fake id for the few purchases I make which aren&#039;t digital delivery but I am always interested in the discussing the law.&nbsp;

				@Wadozo<br />I have to agree with the immediate three posts that follow your statements about using real name and real address.<br /><br />Using a fake name at an address only arouses suspicion, as mentioned.<br /><br />If you are TRULY paranoid, when you get your mail.. take it into your home and write &quot;Return to sender on it&quot;, don&#039;t open the damn thing for a ~3 days and you should be safe.<br />If your ordering personal amounts, I really dont suspect they are going to come looking for your hide. If you are ordering large amounts, well.. your on your own.<br /><br />Ordering large amounts is a another subject completely, IMHO.

				I don&#039;t know where you live R4N50M, but where I live, there&#039;s not even a slight chance that using a fake name arouses suspicion.&nbsp; ??? I fail to see how that even plays a part in all of this.&nbsp; ??? The only thing that springs to mind is that your from the US where the USPS use a database linking peoples names to their current address, which doesn&#039;t happen in my country. If this isn&#039;t the case though, I seriously have no idea what you&#039;re on about and having had over 100 successful orders, my stats speak for themselves.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> No, dude...&nbsp; you have it backwards.&nbsp; The top sticky thread in the shipping forum &quot;Former Postal Inspection Intern...&quot; goes over this ad nauseum.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No I don&#039;t mate. ??? Where I live, the advise given by this person doesn&#039;t apply. ??? If you live in the US, then it might to you.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />jackchurchill,Yes, having a package seized in transit by Customs which is addressed to you at your place of residence is not necessarily going to result in you facing charges. However, the whole premise of buying illegal drugs on the Hidden Web through Silk Road is based on you maintaining your anonymity and not coming to the attention of LE. Using your real name on anything to do with an anonymous market just doesn&#039;t make sense. Should the vendor or yourself slip up, you&#039;re placing your freedom in jepoardy by using your real name. Staying anonymous is paramount but if they intercept a parcel sent to your address and addressed to your real name, it will provide LE with cause to begin an investigation into the package. Obviously depending on the quantity seized, this could mean setting up Traffic Analysis on your internet to see what sites your visiting or surveillance on your movements. What ever the case may be, you will come to the attention of the Police if a package addressed to you is seized and IMO, that&#039;s the last thing you would want when you&#039;re trying to maintain your anonymity.
