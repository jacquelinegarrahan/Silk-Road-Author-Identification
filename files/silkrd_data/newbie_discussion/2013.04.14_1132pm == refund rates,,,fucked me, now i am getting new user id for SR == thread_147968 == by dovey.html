				Okay,,, I received like 8BTC refund all due to retard seller&#039;s fault.<br /><br />1. The Scurvy Crew -&nbsp; they are good and nice, very gentle, yet they shipped DOx instead of lucy.&nbsp; they offered 95% refund, and I took it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b/c of this incident they are not carrying lucy anymore.<br /><br />2. TESSELLATED - this seller sent me impotent product, didn&#039;t do any good, yet i was kind to offer him partial refund even the product was fucking shit.<br />now this seller is BAD SELLER according to &quot;The Avengers LSD Vendors Review&quot; (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0)<br />impotent due to failure in packaging, all got wet and gone bad. <br /><br />this refund activity happened when 1BTC = $14 ,&nbsp; now 1BTC = $99.<br /><br />I just cannot find anyway to recover my account in good standing other than creating new one.<br />yo, don&#039;t take refund easily,, think carefully , get more refund from your seller when you are in similar situation like me.<br />I would not took partial refund if I knew this &#039;exaggerated stats&#039; will hunt my account.<br /><br />

				I know how it feels. I&#039;ve been a member here for almost 2 years and just recently got my first refund and it killed my stats. I can&#039;t make bulk orders because they all seem to say I have to finalize early if my refund rate is over 5%. I sacrificed my account for a measly $50 (50% of order) and I wish I could take it back. I didn&#039;t know it would be so high.<br /><br />Total transactions: 74<br />Total spent: $2821.76<br />Refund rate: 5.07%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 year

				That&#039;s confusing. I had a partial refund (half the original purchase amount). My refund percentage is still 0%. Maybe it&#039;s only if you get a full refund?
