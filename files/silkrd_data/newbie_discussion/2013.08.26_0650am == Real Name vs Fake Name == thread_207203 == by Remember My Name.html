				Post by: <strong>Remember My Name</strong> on <strong>August 26, 2013, 06:50 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Just wanted to have a discussion about the use of real names or fake names on SR.<br /><br />I plan on using a fake name for my order, as it will be sent to a friend&#039;s rental property, and if anything were to happen (such as inquiries from LE) then my friend could just claim &quot;it&#039;s not addressed to me so you don&#039;t have a leg to stand on&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t know what the fuck you&#039;re talking about, for all we know it could be addressed to a previous resident.&quot; Technically LE could not press charges because of a lack of proof.<br /><br />Of course, when I give the vendor the address, the message will be encrypted. Is there any way for LE to find out that my friend will be having drugs sent to their house?<br /><br />My worry about having drugs sent to my own house with my own address is that once they come through customs and the dogs smell the package and point it out to customs officers, they will open the package, find the drugs, and then notify LE that we tried to have drugs sent to our house. LE could then charge us with the intention of purchasing drugs or whatever. This couldn&#039;t happen if it was sent to a fake name at a rental property (at least I don&#039;t think).<br /><br />Would love to know anyone&#039;s experiences/stories with using fake names or friends addresses etc.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				From what I have heard absolutely do not use a fake name, this is a red flag for them to inspect the package when they see a name that never has received mail at that address before or a name from another address.

				What about if the package is sent to your own address with a real name and either the dogs smell it while in transit or customs put it through an x-ray machine? No amount of stealth would be able to hide that..

				Real name, your own address. Don&#039;t tell your friend - act like you got cold feet and don&#039;t want to participate any more. Go it alone and when your friend asks about the amazing drugs you have tell them you met a new dealer.<br /><br />Pick a vendor with a good reputation and you will be more then fine. Some vendor&#039;s stealth is nothing short of amazing. Ask around. Order domestic if you worry about customs.<br /><br /><br />If you do choose to go ahead and use a fake name please be honest about this if your package doesn&#039;t show up. It isn&#039;t fair to use a vendor to test name/address combinations.<br /><br /><br />A couple of the most common reasons buyers don&#039;t receive a package is using fake names/bad drops, and telling a friend about their pending order (&quot;friend&quot; scoops the package).

				test it for yourself ...<br /><br />make a package / letter&nbsp; you think that looks a little bit strange, put some sugar or something in it, and send it to yourself using fake names.<br /><br />Here In Germany it is no Problem to use &quot;fake name + real Address&quot; Combination. It is not the name where a letter is delivered, its an Address.<br /><br />Im doing this very often when i have to register for something when i know there will come ad - letters ... one look at the letter = fake name -&gt; unread to trash ;)<br />sometimes i use funny combinations so that the postman is laughing when im at home ;)<br /><br /><br />but... at SR i use real name/address :P

				I&#039;m all for fake names and false identities, it&#039;s part of the whole &quot;Fuck the world&quot; &quot;Fuck the government&quot; thing, and I prefer it that way. Especially in places like the internet, and ESPECIALLY on sites of anonymity.<br />But when it comes to ordering packages off of sites like SR, your real name is a must (when placing the order).<br />Now, if you are not ordering it to YOUR address, YOUR name is not the one you want.<br />You want a name that matches a resident of the address you are shipping the package to.<br /><br />One of the biggest red flags with packages going through customs (or any stop) are false or misprinted names.<br />If you don&#039;t have a record (even if you do) and you are legally living at the residence you are shipping it to, UPS is gonna see your package as any other package that goes through there on a day-to-day basis. (As long as it doesn&#039;t reek.)<br /><br />Many people have gotten busted for ordering several packages under mismatching/false names, so I STRONGLY discourage it, and as a person that would not like to see another citizen of anonymity go down, I ask you to not go about the route you are considering taking.<br /><br />Much respect for posting about it before doing it. Glad to see someone actually cares about what could happen to them. :)

				Added -<br /><br />If somehow you do get cracked down, like many people have stated already, you can just deny it. Due to the anonymity of Tor and the security procedures you should take before making a purchase, there is no actual evidence provided that point to you ordering the package.<br /><br />Therefore, they could attempt to bring it as far as they can, but you still (most likely(knockonwood)) should not get in any legal trouble for it. As long as you say you have no idea about the package.

				Here is some info from a different link that addresses this issue rather succinctly from a USPS worker;<br /><br />&nbsp;A note from a postal worker&nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0<br />« on: May 29, 2013, 07:55 pm »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />To vendors and buyers alike,<br /><br />First of all, I work with parcels, letters, and flats for many hours a day. I don&#039;t work at a large hub office with inspectors and dogs and such, so I can&#039;t help with those issues, but I do sort through around 1500-2000 parcels in any given day, and I know what looks normal and what does not. I also know how the average postal worker approaches their job, and this is something that I think a lot of SilkRoader&#039;s don&#039;t take into account. Here are some thoughts that apply to domestic mailing:<br /><br />- Most postal workers just want to make it to the end of their shift. They don&#039;t care about catching drugs through the mail. There are plenty of things to watch out for that have already been posted here regarding suspicious mail, but the fact is, we see a LOT of mail in a day. There are many stupid people using the mail system. Therefore, we see a lot of addressing errors, poor packaging, and everything else, every day. A lot. It is not as alarming as some of you guys think to come across something with a first name only (if it looks like it was written by a child), short postage (each carrier takes about 0-5 pieces of &quot;postage due&quot; mail out every day), lots and lots of tape (this is actually quite common and probably a good idea), and what have you.<br /><br />- Use larger type for addressing. A vast majority of parcels are sorted by hand, which means that some grumpy old bastard tucked into the corner of some funky office somewhere needs to be able to read your address. I recommend using larger type (14pt+), and all capitals. Your goal is to minimize the amount of time any given employee spends looking at your parcel. Big, unambiguous addressing going a long ways here.<br /><br />- For the love of crap, smell-proof your damn parcel. The ONLY TIMES I HAVE EVER SEEN A PARCEL SET ASIDE FOR THE INSPECTORS, is when it stinks. Period. We have never seen buds falling out of the mail, or anything like that. It is ALWAYS the smell that alerts an employee to a particular parcel. Also, larger parcels are much easier to single out than smaller ones. With small parcels, it&#039;s the whole container of small parcels that stinks and is much harder to tell which one is to blame without smelling each one. With a large parcel, you catch a fat whiff when you grab that particular mail piece. No bueno.<br /><br />- Even suspicious mail pieces get through, because not every postal employee cares if someones gets a sack mailed to them. I&#039;ve sent plenty on through personally. That said, plan on about a 70% reporting rate when it comes to stinky mail. Some folks just like the attention of being the person to find drugs in the mail. &quot;Teacher, teacher!&quot;<br /><br />- Your parcel needs to be able to survive being thrown hard against a wall, because it will be. The USPS sorts an enormous volume of parcels, and the only way to do it is usually with an employee literally throwing your mail into containers. Sometimes those containers are far away and it needs to be thrown very hard. Sometimes your parcel takes the impact of a 50lb parcel landing on top of it from far away. Plan on it. If your packaging can&#039;t handle abuse like this, redesign. I tape up a handful of packages every day and I can usually see inside of the ones that break open. Mostly Amazon.com orders, I can tell you. Use thick materials.<br /><br />- Do not trust cardboard Priority envelopes unless your product is FLAT. These &quot;flats&quot; are co-mingled with all of the other parcels most of the time, so they take a lot of abuse. Anything odd shaped in these envelopes causes a tear. Use the Tyvek envelopes instead, because they are damn-near indestructible. They&#039;re also free. &#039;Nuff said.<br /><br />Do not trust the adhesive on USPS supplied Priority mailing boxes. The adhesive on the flats envelopes is usually just fine, but the boxes get squished in a way that breaks these seals losse and all of your shit comes spilling out. Reinforce with packing tape and it will survive. The boxes themselves are actually quite sturdy, what with being free and all. Just don&#039;t trust the glue.<br /><br />- Use Express only if timeliness is an issue. It is handled more gingerly to be sure, but as our premier guaranteed service, in fact it guarantees that an employee will be closely examining your mail piece just to make sure they get it to the right place. We get our asses REAMED OUT HOLLOW if we mess up an Express, which means we really stare at each one for a moment longer to make sure we get it to the right place. This is great if your packaging is up to snuff, but a liability if there are addressing issues, etc. Any issues are almost always brought to the supervisor&#039;s attention. When we screw up an Express, our bosses bosses boss hears about it. No joke, they get a report on botched expresses every morning. This isn&#039;t a low-key delivery method. A carrier might get about 30 normal parcels for every Express they get. That means they&#039;re thinking about it specifically, making a mental note where the delivery point is, figuring how to get it there before 3PM. They have to sign for it. Decide for yourself whether or not you want us paying that much attention to your parcel or if its better off with the 2000 other pieces of first class and Priority mail that rarely demand a second look.<br /><br />- Use real names! Our policy is to return mail that is not addressed to the occupant on file of a particular address, unless it&#039;s a known forward. So, if your carrier is doing what he&#039;s being paid to do, he will return a mail piece addressed to a a fake name every time. Yes, sometimes they deliver it anyway. Sometimes it&#039;s a sub on the route that doesn&#039;t give a shit. But bad names are supposed to go back.<br /><br />https://www.usps.com/zip4/<br /><br />- Undeliverable mail gets returned to sender. If sender doesn&#039;t exist, mail goes to &quot;dead&quot; mail unit. This could be a life-altering problem for the buyer. Let&#039;s say you order 10 grams of coke to your apartment to start a new coke dealing venture, except you forgot to include your apt number in the address. Whoops, vendor already posted your shit because, how is he supposed to know, right? Carrier marks parcel IA, or insufficient address, it goes back to the return address, which let&#039;s say is a fake address. THAT carrier marks the return address an undeliverable and the mail piece goes to the dead letter center, the only place legally allowed to OPEN FIRST CLASS MAIL without a warrant. They are a well-intentioned lot, just trying to find a deliverable address so that you can get your crap. They open your dope box looking for names and contact info. Sometimes they find nothing, sometimes they find an Amazon.com invoice and the parcel is reunited with its rightful owner. Sometimes they find your coke, and they hand it over to the inspectors along with the envelope/box with your full name and (almost complete) address on it. Mucho no bueno. Correct addresses and names are the key here, people!<br /><br />- Don&#039;t mail objects in letter envelopes. Our processing equipment sends each letter on a 40mph journey through sorting machines that have many, many twists and turns. If you can&#039;t bend your letter 90 degress at any point, it won&#039;t make it, most likely. Heavy letters get thrown out of the belts. Lopsided letters get culled to be thrown manually (if you&#039;re lucky), or worse, run through the machine anyways and subsequently jam. Either the jam itself or the process of clearing it often tears apart many a letters. Realtors often send house keys in letter envelopes and none of them make it through. I&#039;ve even pulled a pair of panties out of the machines before. Paper only, or very thin and flexible items. Make sure it weighs less than 1oz!

				Regarding using a fake name:<br /><br />I agree it is stupid and will do more harm than good, however is there is a legit way to set up a fake name at your real address? For example you know those address change cards the post office has that you fill out when you are moving. Can one of those be submitted with your real address and a fake name along with sending test letters with the same fake name multiple times to the real address to in essence &quot;create&quot; an address for the fake name? IDK I&#039;m just thinking out loud here but there has to be a way to do this the &quot;right&quot; way because I def agree that just throwing a fake name on a piece of mail is a bad idea. Anyone have thoughts on how to make this work?

I thought maybe filling out one of those with the fake name and real address would make it more legit on their end so no red flags would go up at all. <br /><br />If any postal workers or people with extensive knowledge of how the post office operates in this particular area could chime in on this it would be appreciated.

				Order to your house with your real name and understand that you never heard of the silkroad and you had no knowledge of drugs coming to your house, period. Don&#039;t tell your friends, your family, the police, or anybody else. If a friend asked where you got the drugs from say you have a drug dealer.
