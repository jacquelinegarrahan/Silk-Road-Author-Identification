				Topshelftrades showed up as a vendor a couple of weeks ago, he was offering what looked to be some pretty damn nice smoke with free shipping, his listings started off as all within one ounce of various strains and he had a few reviews from various places in the world (could have been fake profiles though), none of his original listings mentioned anything to do with finalizing early and it even said on their profile &quot;i&#039;ll never require finalize early, your funds are safe with me&quot;. Now I placed an order last week, which they then told me had been shipped, however out of nowhere yesterday the order was cancelled by the vendor and the funds released back to me, oh and the vendors profile vanished so that it became message only. Now, I&#039;m not sure what the fuck happened. I&#039;m kinda hoping it turns out that it was a slip-up on the vendors part or that they decided they weren&#039;t cut-out for SR and abandoned the profile, i don&#039;t know why someone would bother, what seams more feasible is that they were trying to scam people. A while after i ordered an oz of them a listing came up for 1lb for 1200eu which is insane for the quality of weed they were claiming to sell, this listing however said that it did require FE, so this led me to believe that whoever was the other end of that account was trying to gain trust or even just interest then put up what would be an amazing deal saying FE so that people order it and release the funds straight away, i hope this wasn&#039;t the case and if it was i hope that they didn&#039;t get away with it and fool anyone, oh and the cop thing, well yanno, stoners gotta have their conspiracy theorys but i highly doubt it was a cop, so yeah, did anyone else have dealings with them or have any ideas as to what the fuck happened?

				any marketplace admins have any info as to what happened with topshelftrades account? most likely a scam but it would be interesting to know if any orders were actually successful. Can marketplace admins check the buyer stats of the people who apparently had orders come through and check if they are real accounts? Peace

				He was requiring FE. In fact he almost had convinced me to FE on a 4500 USD for 4 pounds of AAAA.<br />Clear scammer, but people never learn

				cunt, glad you didnt fall for it bro, 4500 for 4lbs is definitely too good to be true, he didn&#039;t get any of my money but i&#039;m going to a music festival this weekend and wanted that weed for it, now my moneys tied up in btc so can&#039;t even get something local, the annoying thing about SR is we can&#039;t track him down, would love to give him the same treatment me and my friends joke about giving spray dealers, drive them out into the middle of nowhere blindfolded, then make them get out of the van, hold a empty but cocked gun to their head whilst making them dig their own grave then make them kneel in front of the grave and say their last words before pulling the trigger and no bullet coming out, then you kick them into the big hole in the ground tell them they better renounce their scumbag ways and drive off leaving them covered in their own urine.
