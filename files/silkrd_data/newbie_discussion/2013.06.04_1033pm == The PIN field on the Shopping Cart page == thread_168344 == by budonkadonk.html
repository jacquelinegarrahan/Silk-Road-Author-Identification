				Noob here...<br /><br />My question is: what is the PIN field for on the SHopping Cart page that appears just after the name / address field? I want to make a purchase for the first time on Silk Road but am unsure of what that field is about<br /><br />Thanks

The PIN that you created at that time is needed in order to make purchases or withdraw Bitcoin from your account.<br /><br />Libertas

				OK, got it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another dumb question then... do I simply enter my name and shipping address, enter my PIN and that automatically encrypts my name/address?<br /><br /><br /><br />

Then again, perhaps nothing happened to them - we just don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Regardless, that is no reason to become complacent. It takes under 5 seconds to encrypt an address and copy &amp; paste it into the address field when placing an order. Is 5 seconds really worth the less than desirable possibilities that can result from not spending that time using PGP?<br /><br />Libetas
