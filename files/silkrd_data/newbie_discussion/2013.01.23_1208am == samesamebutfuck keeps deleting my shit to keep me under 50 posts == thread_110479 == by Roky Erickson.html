				I think 50 posts is a bit extreme...also it seems it was changed without informing anyone... I had 10 posts on main forum and then all of a sudden could not post anymore there and did not know why so I messaged DPR and he told me about the new 50+ posts on newbie forum...

If you disagree with my decision to moderate your thread feel free to report it to the admins, they will take one look at your posts and delete your account altogether.<br /><br />Good luck on here mate, you&#039;re gonna need it.
