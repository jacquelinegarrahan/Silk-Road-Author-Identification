				For my first purchase on SR I&#039;m hoping to stay domestic (Canada) which limits my options. I&#039;m buying mdma, and trying to decide between MIMM&#039;s &quot;Armani Express&quot; and JOR&#039;s (by way of PPLLUURR) &#039;Red Mario&quot;. Any thoughts or suggestions? I&#039;d be willing to go with straight powder as well, but I&#039;m not sure about the quality of what is available locally.

				honestly skip buying pills and go straight for mdma. Less chance of seizure and pills arent exactly known for using the highest quality mdma

				I agree, don&#039;t bother with the pills, moonrocks all the way, luckyluciano is best if buying bulk....

				What makes you say that?&nbsp; Based on past experience? I love his white speakers. Personally blew harder then i did on the moonrocks we got from aakoven. Lots of ppl i know dont trust moon rocks as much because of the methylone out there. All the pills turn purple/black on reagent anyways?<br /><br />SS

				Yeah, honestly I&#039;d rather go with powder if I knew it was high quality. But since I want to stay with a domestic (Canadian) vendor, my options are limited. I was going to go with MarijuanaIsMyMuse&#039;s tan powder, but almost all the recent reviews of it I&#039;ve seen have said it is really weak....

				Not sure about MIMM, but luckyluciano is tops, minimum 28grams though.<br /><br />goodfornothing is another new canadian vendor, decent prices it seems (sr is down at the moment, so i don&#039;t have his vendor page handy) and a variety of quantities.<br /><br />good hunting

				MIMM&#039;s AX pills are very good. I&#039;ve ordered them on three separate occasions and rolled my arse off each time. Pill reports lists them as &quot;MDxx High&quot; with no additional active adulterants. I would advise against ordering his powder though, I&#039;ve heard some very bad things about quality.<br /><br />Also his stealth is incredible but due to a recent influx of orders it takes him a bit of time to ship out (order on Saturday, marked in transit on Sunday night, doesn&#039;t actually ship until Thursday).

				Just to update folks I decided to go with CanadianForger&#039;s tan mdma. They&#039;re new in the game, but after some good reviews and good customer responsiveness I figured I&#039;d give them a go. Will update upon receipt and trial.
