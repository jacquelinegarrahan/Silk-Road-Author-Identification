				Hey guys, I ordered something from frankmatthews&nbsp; 8) and when I read his FAQ:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">FINALIZING:<br /><br />After every FE order leave feedback. So i can track your order down If something goes wrong!<br /><br />I if you do not leave feedback,I can not give any refund on not arrived packages.<br /><br /><br />Orders below 1000$ USD must be finalized early. If you don&#039;t like that or feel comfortable with this, please don&#039;t order<br /></code><br />But I don&#039;t understand what this means or how to do it :/ I looked everywhere but couldn&#039;t find anything usefull... I already ordered from the road before but it was just fine to finalize when I received my product <br /><br />So what does he mean with it? Already placed my order

				Finalizing early means releasing funds from the escrow directly to the seller as if you already received your package.<br />Pretty much just go to orders, and click finalize. and if you don&#039;t have any feedback to give just write (FE FOR TRUSTED SELLER) and then once you receive your package you can update it with your review.<br /><br />Sellers do this so that they can have funds available to &#039;re-up&#039;

				And just to add some more information - the vendor needs to confirm your order first before you are given the option to FE.&nbsp; :)

				Please make sure your vendor is trusted...<br /><br />Here, many experienced users recommend against FE even as a newbie.

				Only FE with a trusted vendor, and sometimes that may go awry if their account has been sold/compromised.<br />I notice vendors who FE usually charge lower rates

				Greetings &amp; Salutations to all on this wonderful community/marketplace. I have spent about a month now researching &amp; collecting information around using the road, as well as all the side orders like BC/Encryption/Safety/GpG etc, and I&#039;m about 12 mins, 42 secs away from placing the all important 1st order, (fuck me, what a buzz, ehhh?!?!?). I just have 1 question to ask regarding FE.&nbsp; I have read on numerous occasions, in various posts, by an ever growing list of people around the dangers of FE, in fact the general vibe I&#039;m getting is NEVER, NEVER, EVER FE!!!! However, if this is the case, how come so many of the vendor reviews by buyers clearly state &#039;FE, awaiting delivery&#039;? Practically every vendor I&#039;ve looked at on the market has their reviews littered with such comments, which suggests to me that it is, in fact, common practice?&nbsp; Forgive me if I&#039;m slow, just missing something, or need to go to Specsavers, but this strikes me as extremely contradictory, and In my world contradiction = suspicion. So what&#039;s the deal? To FE, or not to FE, that is the question! Any answers welcomed &amp; sorry if this appears trivial &amp; obvious, but to me it isn&#039;t &amp; in this world it would be foolish to do anything blindly, no matter how small....!&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers! :-)

				Mrsmileyface, Don&#039;t worry! Just copy the name from the Silk Road seller in the forum and look for the review thread. <br />The first moment is always the most scary one. But once you get the hang of it ;) Also make sure the first time you take a seller thats high rated as best selling in your product.

				There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong in Finalizing Early, just do your research about the vendor and be sure you can trust him. However, I think for a first order would be better to order from someone you can stay in escrow with, to minimize all the anxiety you get from a first order. I have ordered like 10 times in about a couple of months and I&#039;ve finalized early in two orders, and I haven&#039;t had the slightest problem. But, the ideal is to be able to stay in escrow (one of the virtues of SR).

				Thank you karika &amp; Mr Hazlo, for your thoughts &amp; advice. My 1st order has now been nailed &amp; within escrow, I now anticipate watching for postman pat&#039;s little red van arriving within the next few days, I&#039;ll bet that brings it&#039;s own buzz also!

				Apologies for flogging a dead thread, but this whole experience just keeps bringing it&#039;s own little buzz, with each development towards my ultimate goal! Just read my 1st order details &amp; discovered the field stating, &#039;processing&#039; had changed to &#039;in transit&#039;, oh what joy! I actually feel like an excited kiddie awaiting the visit of Santa Claus with my goodies at Xmas! This is a common phrase I, &amp; I&#039;m sure many others, have used countless times in the past, but this ACTUALLY, REALLY does feel that way! Fucking brilliant, absolutely brilliant!<br />Opened my SR account - Nice buzz, deposited 1st bitcoins in my account - another buzz, placed 1st order - best buzz so far, but the latest development - IN TRANSIT, has given me such a buzz, I&#039;ve been compelled to write this post! I can&#039;t imagine what joy finding that all important delivery in my letterbox will bring, never mind the actual effects of my purchase at the end of it all! The whole journey is proving to be very enjoyable, and I&#039;m itching to order something else just to keep it going! I&#039;d love to share this with actual people I know, but that would be just stupid &amp; foolhardy in a position such as mine, akin to what is commonly known as a &#039;school boy error&#039;, hence this rant at you lot!!&nbsp; <br />If it gives at least 1 person a laugh, I&#039;m happy! Either way I had to share it!<br /><br />

				As someone who works for a highly reputable and respected vendor who asks buyers with 0/0 stats to FE, my best advice is definitely check reviews and also the comments in general made by that specific vendor on the SR forum. You can get a feel for their ethics by the way they represent themselves. Aside from the playful banter here and there this should give you a good idea as to who you are dealing with.<br /><br />I read a brilliant post on The Australian Thread where what was said would be applicable to anyone navigating the SR waters.
