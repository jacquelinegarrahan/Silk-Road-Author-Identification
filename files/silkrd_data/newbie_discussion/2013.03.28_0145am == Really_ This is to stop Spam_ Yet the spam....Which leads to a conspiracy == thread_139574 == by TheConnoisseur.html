				First off the 50 post rule is supposdely supposed to help stop the spam that occured like the btc websites etc <br />YET, there is still such posts, and the captcha protection is SO flawed, I doubt it does much but make a bot take a half hour to reach 50 posts (If that) <br /><br />For example I just opened up ehh 4 or 5 threads to post in, and Since the captcha is SO Shitty I fucked it up all 4 times * The fucker was hard to read <br /><br />And I noticed, THAT afterwards it of course required me to Enter a new captcha.....Now listen to this .....<br /><br />THE CAPTCHAS WERE ALL THE SAME......Think how easy it would be to open up say 50 Threads, have a pre determined random response thats vaugley coherent, OR JUST RANDOM like the 50 posts threads..... and BOOM you have your 50 posts in 30 minutes ( IF you wait 30 seconds before hitting reply on each thread....<br /><br /><br /><br />SO whats the point? <br /><br /><br />Well perhaps someone In SR benefits from the spam..... ( Think of the scams on SR TONY76, Quick Buy,&nbsp; and all the phising.....This could make someone THOUSANDS.....and anyone in control of SR could EASILY make this happen....<br /><br />&nbsp;

				But if you want to get rid of spam.....GET A GOOD CAPTCHA!!!! <br /><br />Its not hard to do, and its not that expensive especially when you own such a profitable site.....<br /><br /><br />Shit I bet if you asked for a donation we could have Hundreads of BTC to fund one in days.
