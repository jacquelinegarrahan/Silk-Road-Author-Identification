				BMR sells weapons I think. I don&#039;t know if its a reputable site or not though, never used it. There are probably other options too if you know where to look.

				a knife is much faster and efficient compared to almost all firing guns...<br />anyway dont fucking around and looking for fights is much less expensive,so i suggest you to take a look to all weeds around here :D<br /><br />Put flowers in the guns!!!

				The guns on BMR are wildly expensive - in the range of 3x retail, not to mention that being stealthy is a whole lot harder with a firearm than with small quantities of recreational chemicals.&nbsp; The legal issues also get a lot nastier a lot more quickly and will go federal almost from the start.<br /><br />In the vast majority of states in the US it&#039;s still legal to buy guns face-to-face and there are tons of classified ad sites that make it easy to find any number of people happy to anonymously take your cash.&nbsp; With the notable exception of the more exotic stuff (full auto, destructive devices, etc) or buying from some random guy on a street corner there isn&#039;t even much in the way of underground stings.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot more complicated if you&#039;re in NYC, Chicago or DC but in most of the rest of the country the availability, selection and price of firearms is just a hell of a lot better and safer outside the bounds of this type of marketplace.&nbsp;

				yea BMR is a complete rip off for pistols. but if you want a fully auto rifle then sure paying more for it might be your thing<br /><br />when i see a glock selling for $1500-2000 and i can literally go down the street and get one off the street for $250...thats ridiculous<br /><br />make me want to sell guns for christ sake. i aint bout that life tho. lol
