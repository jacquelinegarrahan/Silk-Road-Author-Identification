You should contact the vendor individually to ask about combined shipping options. Vendors have different ways they deal with this. Some could create a custom listing, some have combined shipping built in. You really have to ask.<br /><br />2. First, USE PGP. Just do it.<br />Second, you should use the cart only for one vendor. This makes it so you don&#039;t force them to try to decode three different PGP keys or whatever. So basically, take all the items out of your cart, start one with all of the items from one vendor. Encrypt your address with their pgp key, and send the BTC. Repeat this process for each individual vendor.<br /><br />&quot;what kind of discretion have you all experienced with vendors, like what sort of things to they do, its highly likely someone will be opening my mail illegally?&quot;<br />I&#039;m not really sure what you mean by this. As far as stealth goes, you should look at the comments that customers put on the listings. Lots of them usually comment on stealth. Some of the vendor&#039;s profiles will even talk about stealth.<br /><br />&quot;and finally, is the return address they use a fake address or a PO box or what&quot;<br />They wouldn&#039;t use a fake address. That raises major red flags for the postal service. I&#039;ve heard of a vendor using a comic book store. It really varies. I&#039;m sure some use PO boxes.

				stealth is a joke, when i first used SR i thought it was gonna be badass how it was hidden, ive only had one vendor actually put in the time to be clever, and that was with lsd which is easy to hide, but truthfully its obviously harder to hide qp&#039;s hp&#039;s and birds, a bad example of shipping is when i ordered an ounce purpleurcle and it was vac sealed and put on a plastic usps bag, i was so pissed that the vendor sent it to me like that, but hey, i got it no problem, that goes to show that they have so much mail to move there not inspecting every piece that comes in, i had a girlfriend that worked in a mail room and they would occasionally have packages that reaked like weed and they were told to just send it, they didnt even care. anyway&nbsp; I&#039;d ask for a custom listing alot of vendors dont mind putting one up for you, a recent problem for me this week is when i asked if the vendor could put it all in one package, he brought up a good point with that, if he put both in one box he&#039;d have no proof of sending it and i could fuck him over by making a claim with sr or whatever, from my 1 year of experience, most vendors are good businessmen and will help you out with little things like that,

				Right you have to ask the vendor; all those things are going to vary from vendor to vendor. You might get combined shipping if everything fits in one box/envelope. Or place multiple orders a few days apart maybe to spread things out a bit.<br /><br />If including info other than just your address I would put some blank lines in there like<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">Please send to:<br /><br />Joe Smith<br />14 Wells Circle<br />San Jose, CA 85935<br /><br />10 Grams High Quality Marijuana<br />3.5 grams molly<br />Yellow pipe</code><br />Just to help avoid a copy paste error that results in your address looking like this:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">Joe Smith<br />14 Wells Circle<br />San Jose, CA 85935<br />10 Grams High Quality Marijuana</code>
