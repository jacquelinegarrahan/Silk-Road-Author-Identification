				Yea I always note that weed is more expensive in NYC than many other metro areas.&nbsp; I think weed that&#039;s $420 in NYC is like 360-380 upstate, but keep going till you cross the Canadian border and we&#039;re talking $240 but usually the trim job is shaggy.&nbsp; Go down to DC we are back to 360, but I note high pricing again once I&#039;m in Florida for some reason.&nbsp; These are just my observations.&nbsp; Then head west, prices get high in some midwest states but can be really low in others.&nbsp; Colorado always seems to be an overproductive and therefore lower price state, whereas Cali seems to have more bud bud way more smokers and seems to support higher prices despite seemingly endless supply.&nbsp; Just my two cents

				Jesus that&#039;s insane prices. In Ontario Canada an oz is no more then $220&#039; it&#039;s usually $200. Or $130 for a half-oz, or if you just wanted to buy a half-quarter 3.5grams it&#039;s $40. Also QP&#039;s QuarterPounds (4oz) is about $700-$750. I never got why weed was sooooo much on SilkRoad but now it appears I&#039;m spoiled by local prices. These are the same prices I&#039;ve been paying for the last 11 years here, its not like it just became cheap.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m starting to be happy with our local prices considering what you guys have to pay in your local areas.

				I would hate to even ask.&nbsp; The only high grade you could get from a dealer here is shipped from California.

				Down in SC the price is between 350 and 4ish. Typically it just depends on the strain.
