				Hey so why is Cannabis so expensive in domestic Australia?<br />Something like $30 a gram.<br />I have already done research prior, and it&#039;s because they have to import the weed?<br /><br />Now why the hell would you import weed into Australia if you can just set up a simple 20 plant grow room with a 400-600w HPS, and another room for cloning plants to get all females and a harvest every 2 months? This harvest would get you a kilo or two alone.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m just wondering why the hell is nobody growing cannabis and selling on silk road in Australia? Because let me tell you, if one guy can step up and do that. He/she will control the market. Moving bulk like that. <br /><br />Because in America that is exactly what they do.<br /><br /><br />

				Plenty of weed is grown in Australia, in fact Australia is the highest consumer of weed per capita than any country in the world. Weed is also decriminalized in most states here so fairly easy to get really, recently local Silk Road prices don&#039;t reflect the cost to buy weed in&nbsp; Australia. I would say most regular smokers wouldn&#039;t bother buying from Silk Road.<br /><br />Other drugs such as MDMA are different story all together...

				Saying you have done your research and then say that the Australian market are mostly importing cannabis? Sorry but that is not the right info.<br />I am pretty certain 99% of the cannabis in Australia IS produced here, there are many many grow houses here, many many outdoor grows here.<br />Like above poster said, the SR Australian cannabis market does not really represent what the market is actually like.<br /><br />The laws are pretty lax especially in certain states. I feel there usually is a bit of a drought around Easter time though as well.

				It&#039;s possible, you just need to be really good.<br /><br />A kilo is basically two pounds, many instances where plants have produced a pound alone (sure this means being a green thumb but it is possible)<br />I didn&#039;t know that most of the weed is grown locally, but please note that this is an illegal market and the information can be a bit sketchy. :p<br /><br />But you do know marijuana is pretty high yielding, outdoor marijuana can produces on average 8 oz a plant. (there has been cases where people got a few pounds from a 20 ft monster) Indoor marijuana produces on average 3 oz a plant (under a 1000w hps). <br /><br />20 plants x 85.5 grams (3 oz) = 1.710 kilos dry weight.<br />(This is going on averages, yields can be higher or less)<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about Australian dealers. I&#039;m purely referring to the silk road dealers, who have told me countless times that they would buy in bulk from another person, why not just grow your own?

				Probably cause it takes a few cycles and a lot of research to perfect your growing technique and well lets say pot smokers aren&#039;t the most motivated individuals. Saying that anyone that attempts to import bulk weed into Australia via customs would be a complete idiot.

				I could never see the point in importing weed into Australia &amp; I have never known anyone or heard of anyone who has imported weed. Waste of time - The risk of it getting seized is too high for the marginally lower cost overseas. Obviously importing MDMA / Amphetamine / Cocaine / Heroin would be more worth while because the cost is much, much lower overseas.<br /><br />If you want to grow weed AND sell weed but not in massive quantities, you need a grow house unless you want to be the stupid person who grows weed in their own home and sells it as well. If you get caught selling 1 ounce weed, the cops are most likely going to go back and search your home. If you were growing at home they found find that as well. So to sell and grow, you really need a separate location to grow at. It&#039;s not essential, but as a weed vendor, I would never take that risk.<br /><br />At the moment I don&#039;t have another location which it would be safe to grow at, so that&#039;s why I buy my stock. The grower gets the easiest money, but has the most risk. The higher the risk, the bigger the return. In the future I would like to be able to have a good setup and grow my own weed - But not until I have everything planned out and organised.<br /><br />Also, whilst I don&#039;t know much about growing weed yet, I do know that an average outdoor plant yields 6-9 ounces. I know the weed I sell comes from a plant that yields about 8-9 ounces per tree. But this is variant when weather is abnormal.
