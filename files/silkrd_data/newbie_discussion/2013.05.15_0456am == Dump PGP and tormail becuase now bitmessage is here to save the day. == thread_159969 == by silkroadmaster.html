				Are you tired of little privacy that comes with regular email or even tormail? Are you tired of tormail not working right or there servers being down?

Are you seriously trying to recommend that people stop using PGP in favour of BitMessage?! What a ludicrous suggestion! You then go on to admit you don&#039;t even &quot;know too much about bitmessage&quot;.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />I would STRONGLY advise all members to stick with PGP. BitMessage needs to be fully tested and fully examined before its use is recommended.<br /><br />Libertas

				Quite right Libertas....even as a new member I am very security conscious....dump PGP...?...insane. Would be worth learning a little about encryption then you might understand these things a little more :)<br /><br />:)

				I actually also wanted to not say dump PGP. I know PGP is the standard right now, but in the end I just wanted to get my point across that we need to move on to something better since/if there seems to be a better alternative.&nbsp; It&#039;s late and I was tired when I wrote it. I know that SR sellers can&#039;t stop using PGP, at least not yet. But they should at least check it out, and even download it and test it. I am not stupid OK. I suppose I should have cleared that up in my post.<br /><br />Peace.

				PGP is one of the best defenses we have right now...<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve been a vendor for a little over a month and already I&#039;ve had a vendor order from me using an unencrypted address. I&#039;m not one to judge but for a vendor to order using his own account to order off a vendor in the same country is bad , to do it without PGP is just asking for trouble!<br /><br />As for Bitmessage , wouldn&#039;t trust it as far as I could throw it!

				Astor and I played with BitMessage one night.&nbsp; We both noticed some... well, possibly &quot;inconsistent&quot; behavior, but nothing really worrying.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think either of us saw anything obviously &quot;oh shit, we just leaked our identities&quot; or anything anywhere near that sort of thing.&nbsp; The last I knew he wasn&#039;t recommending it for general users, and neither would I.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice project and it has lots of promise, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s ever going to replace PGP (I mean it doesn&#039;t even accomplish the same job as PGP -- how could it replace it).<br /><br />Just in defense of the program itself and all... :)
