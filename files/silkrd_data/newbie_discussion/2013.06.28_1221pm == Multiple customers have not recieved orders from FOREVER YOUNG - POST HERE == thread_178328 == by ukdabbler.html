				Please post here if you have not received your order from Forever young. There has been a lot of talk surrounding this vendor on the EU heroin thread and I thought it be best if we have a thread dedicated to this issue. Please reply with the item you ordered and the date you ordered. Also any correspondence between you and forever young would be helpful.<br /><br />I personally ordered 0.5 gram of heroin last thursday (20th) marked in transit 21st and he has been nothing but rude to me when I asked about getting a refund due to no show.<br /><br />Thanks

				Yes i had dealings with FOREVER YOUNG<br />about a month ago i seen on his vender page he was doing free UK samples so when messaged him<br />he said pay postage and would send me a .1 tester<br />anyway i only sent him 0.02 coins for postage. <br />Well a month past &amp; nothing so messaged asking if he sent or for coin back not much i know really<br />but its the principle of it.&nbsp; Anyway he messaged back saying bumped and the transaction showing i sent him coin was gone as over a month<br />so i just thought if he that bad for .02 he was not to be trusted.<br />i am sorry to hear this from you&nbsp; and hope sr can do something about him.

				Hi just noticed this new thread i can post on now.<br /><br />Yeah i ordered 0.5g on tuesday night expecting, like last order, that during wednesday it would be marked in transit and delivered thursday. However i waited all day wed for the order to be marked in transit but nothing happened. This was when i decided to have a look on the forums to see if anyone had been having trouble with FY. I then saw a few other folks havin troubles with him so i Msgd him on SR to cancel my order. He read that msg but chose to ignore it. I have also sent a couple more, again asking FY to cancel the order. These msgs are still showing Unread. <br /><br />I believe now that The man himself Forever Young has posibly been looking on the forums aswel and seen that i only had a day or so before i would have been able to cancel the order myself. Now he has gone and marked my order in Transit!!!?? So now i wont have the chance to cancel it myself. Sly or what? Or am i going to get a delivery tomorrow? I have msgd him again on SR asking why he has gone ahead with the order when i already asked him to cancel? Im sure that this alone is a breach of SR seller rules? Surely?? <br /><br />So, i have mailed him one more time telling him that if i get a delivery tomorrow then fair enough the guys pulled thru, and things will be sorted. But if not then i will be reporting him. I think this is fair enough we cant be scared to report someone for fear we will get bad stats. thats just givin vendors like this the chance to fuck us over! Thats why the options there to report, for times like this.<br /><br />If FY is having some problems, like i said in 1 of my msgs to him, why cant he just be decent and fuckin communicate with his customers, cause im sure everyone would understand if theres a problem. This is where i do believe hes up to something cause anyone decent would have been honest with us all.<br /><br />Dont know what u guys think but if my order is no show tomorrow im reporting him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh yeah and if u are reading this Forever Young, respond to my msgs please and we can try sort this out without havin to go down the report route.

Also I hope they read the correspondence as he is completely breaking SR guidelines for sellers. I&#039;ve never had a vendor be so rude to me and he made me feel like I&#039;d done something wrong. It&#039;s bullshit.

				Yes that is true, as I said earlier, I was one of the first to review his product when he started on SR, he used to sell on the streets. I gave him loads of advice, like vac or heat sealing the bag, PGP(which he has never bothered to learn) typing his labels.... well you get the idea.<br /><br />And in return for a double sample, I wrote the very first review on the forum for him. Since then we have stayed in contact although I rarely buy off him because he can be very unreliable. On his profile he states &quot;order before 3pm and you will have it next day&quot;<br /><br />Well that was why I placed the order in the first place - it wasn&#039;t for me though, but for a mate who was in a jam so I said I would try and help out. <br /><br />So this whole thing has got out of proportion, as soon as I found out it was not just me that was having problems it was as if I kind of felt responsible for all the others in the same boat, That is why I want to know what feedback other people are going to give him, to share some the responsibility and guilt.<br /><br />I want to get 100% refund and not have my stats ruined but I can&#039;t see that happening unless we act as one and already someone has reported him, even though I asked people not to.<br />&nbsp;Not that I intended to do nothing, but that it should have been thought out first, to the last detail with the end of getting everyone a good refund and minimum damage to their stats.<br />Now I will have to think again but no matter, and yes, I will support you ukdabbler.<br /><br />I mean, what rule/s has he actually broken?

				Yeah its kinda sad when you have exchanged friendly pms over time only to be fucked over <br />I cant see how he has broken any rules that we can prove&nbsp; I guess they look at our stats and his and a overall look at uk post stats and see it dont add up that we would all lie for a wee bit of gear <br />I have $500 in my account and am spending more time sorting out this .1 than I am sourcing drugs to sell

It is I that needs to apologize, so forget it&nbsp; :)<br />But people have still not answered my question about what feedback score to give him?<br />No need to answer now, it is getting late and I think we should all sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow. I understand that you gave this link ukdabbler ?<br />That is good and is what I intend to do.<br />And you are right about the rules he broke, there is no way we could have all had his packages lost in the post, I should have thought of that myself - stupid me. Shows I am getting tired, been up since 5.30am.<br /><br />And also you are right about the time spent on this. I&#039;ve spent most of the day writing this up etc. How times flies when you are not enjoying yourself but having to justify your actions and cross referencing everything.<br /><br />I am going to sign off now and I will start posting tomorrow. I am hoping that FY will read 2 PM&#039;s that I sent him, but whether he will reply ........???<br /><br />The good news is that if you go to Resolution you don&#039;t have to copy and paste your PM&#039;s, the Administrator that looks at your case has&nbsp; access to all the relevant correspondence, even if you have deleted them, so stay polite and do not display your anger. Not so sure about the posts though, I think they can only read what is currently written. Good night to you all and hope to hear from interested parties tomorrow. ;)

				The postman left a card this morning stating that there was a package for my aunt&nbsp; but there was £1.09 to pay since not enough stamps on it for weight.

				Have just done a massive hit (by my standards) and it hardly touched the sides as they say. Here is a short review:<br /><br />Weight: Spot on a 0.5g (and before you think it, my scales are regularly calibrated and have new batteries) 5/5<br /><br />Just above street gear in terms of quality.<br />Dissolves without any residue in Vit C when heated. But the buzz is average IMO. 3/5 not sure about legs as only just done the first hit. Have not tried smoking it.<br /><br />Packing - not very good, not heat sealed or vac sealed . And I had to pay the extra £1.09 since there wasn&#039;t sufficient on the jiffy bag :o&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; 2/5<br /><br />Stealth - could be improved by typing address labels and heat sealing bag. OK for domestic, and maybe vendor has different international packing method. <br /><br />Communications - Awful, did not respond to PM&#039;s in a timely manner, sometimes never, even though he had read them. <br />Just checked my &quot;sent box&quot; on SR and there are two still in bold lettering, meaning (for newbies that did not know this) that they have not been read! 1/5<br /><br />What have I left out? So far it amounts to 11/20????<br />Anybody care to comment on above - do be honest - you won&#039;t shock me and I maybe getting too old for this anyway.

				I am up for that, one way or another!<br />Now if you don&#039;t mind me asking serenedion, I see you have a refund rate of 7.41%, care to explain how that came about in terms of how it got calculated, not the scumbags involved but how Admin got to that figure (if they gave you an explanation).<br /><br />I have been trying to find out for days, since this FY business began, because at one point it was suggested to me that it would be better to take the loss than have your stats fucked up. <br />I don&#039;t know where that guys head was at, but clearly he was a sandwich short of a pick nick IMO, but I can see where it could apply!

				Fair enough ukdabbler, I was thinking 2/5 and it has arrived so we seem to be singing from the same sheet as they say.<br /><br />Back to your stats serenedion; <br />if taken literally, you got a refund of $300, and you had&nbsp; $9390.04 so before this TX happened you would have had $9390.0 - $300.0)= $9090.0. (ignoring cents)<br /><br />Now ($300/$9090) * 100 to give percentage = (300 * 100)/9090 = 3.3% and not 7.41% :( :( :(&nbsp; &nbsp;:o :o :o<br />You can see the mathematician in me if you look hard enough(LOL) :)<br />So WTF is going on?<br />Keep you all posted here on this Fred.

I can collect it or have it delivered again<br />if I pay the 9p plus a pound charge. <br />I wonder if this is my Fy letter, it might explain where all the other deliveries to other members have gone too.<br />I cannot collect it until&nbsp; tomorrow, I just wondered what you lot thought??? please.<br /><br />C<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>interesting my 10grams are also in the post office with that note only i figured it was a sting but i have put paranoia aside and paid on line to have it redelivered <br />I cant see how a first class stamp wont cover a small package its meant to cover 100 grams<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>to clarify it wasnt from fy <br />also my auto finalise is up soon soon so whats the plan people

				To be honest I never actually accused him of not sending it in my messages to him. It still doesn&#039;t justify his behavior. I&#039;m just glad I finally got it.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Sorry I&#039;ve not been around. Been at alton towers all day. <br /><br />I agree that the letter should have an apologetic tone but without kissing too much ass. We shouldn&#039;t forget that he was rather rude to some of us and didn&#039;t work with us to resolve the issue in a way that I would expect from a vendor. Personally I shan&#039;t be ordering from him again and by not putting enough stamps on the packages drew attention to them which was unnecessary and considering the contents is very dangerous.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m glad this is all over and I&#039;d like to thank you both personally for your help in this matter. (Nakorx and Serenedion)<br /><br />I have work commitments tomorrow so won&#039;t be around but I&#039;ll check in when I can.<br /><br />Take care guys. Just to let you know I trust in your decisions whatever you decide to message him.
