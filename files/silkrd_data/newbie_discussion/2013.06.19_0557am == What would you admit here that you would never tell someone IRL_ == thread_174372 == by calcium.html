				Simple question.<br /><br />It&#039;s an anonymous, fairly nonjudgmental forum. What would you be willing to admit here that you would never tell someone in real life?

				Yeah I&#039;ve had someone mention my actual vendor name , there are only about 4 vendors in nz and mine is the only 1 using any kind of &#039;brand&#039; so maybe thats why countdown stuck out to them.. I once received an order to someone I know personally! New Zealand is a small place after all!

And the way you played the conversation out is beautiful. Anonymity is an amazing thing and its great you keep yourself &quot;unknowing&quot; in real life to cut down on suspicions. Way to go mate!<br /><br />Right now my biggest secret from just about everyone in my life is that I tried marijuana the other day and I had some more today :X
