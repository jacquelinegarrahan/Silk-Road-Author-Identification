				Would controlled deliveries go down on small amounts? like an 8th of weed or something like that?

				Most likely not but it depends on the situation.&nbsp; Most of what I have heard is that if LE intercepts a small amount (personal use) of a controlled substance they will usually just burn it and send a seizure letter to the intended recipient.<br /><br />For an 1/8 of weed I can&#039;t imagine they would deem that worthy of all the time and effort required to do a CD.

				Let me ask this.&nbsp; What is the lowest amount of weed that would be worth the LE&#039;s time for a CD?&nbsp;

In which case, if they seize the package, what happens is that you receive a &quot;love letter&quot; in the mail, which is customs letting you know that a controlled substance was attempted to be sent to you via the postal system. They&#039;ll dispose of it. You can trash the letter and do nothing, and usually nothing else happens. It&#039;s my understanding that you might get an offer to &quot;appeal&quot; to try to accept the package and appeal your reason for ordering the substance, but this is essentially an admission of guilt and unless you have a really solid LEGAL reason for being sent the substance, this is where you might be charged since they now have evidence that you attempted to purchase the controlled substance.<br /><br />So if you get a letter, do nothing, and the majority of the time the issues end there. But your address will likely be scrutinized a bit more by the post/LE so don&#039;t use it to order illegal things for awhile - I&#039;d likely never use that particular address again.

				Interesting, I figured in the US if they siezed even the smallest amount they&#039;d still bring the HAMMER down on you because they hate anyone who uses pot or anything else to expand conciousness and realize what all kind of dimensions etc that there is too life. And they damn sure don&#039;t want us all coming together as one, culturally speaking that is..
