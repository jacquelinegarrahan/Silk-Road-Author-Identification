				&nbsp;Good Evening to all SR &amp; SRF members I&#039;m new to the &#039;road&#039; and to the forum but I&#039;m not new to the &#039;game&#039;&nbsp; ::) how many times have you lot heard that&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; I have only been introduced to the benefits of doing business through this medium very recently and I&#039;ve almost done all the recommended research and tried to take in all ways of doing things below the radar but I still haven&#039;t mastered the dark art of purchasing the dreaded &#039;Bitcoin&#039; and transferring that into SR so I can set up my vendor account&nbsp; :o I know it can&#039;t be that difficult but maybe I&#039;m just one of those people who need to be talked through each step.<br />&nbsp;Anyways once I can get a Vaccount up and running I&#039;m going to be offering a regular supply of a prescription drug that is not offered on any (darknet/deepnet) market place that I&#039;ve been able to access over the last month&nbsp; :P <br /><br />&nbsp;It should appeal to all opiate lovers whose drug of choice is Morphine Sulphate ?&nbsp; It does appear that I might be the only person who can supply the 24hr version of this wonderful medication&nbsp; 8) It is in capsule form so is very easy to reconstitute for IV/IM also it can easily be snorted, no messing about scraping any kind of plasticy outer coating, anyways it will be available in 30mg &amp; 60mg and there will also be a couple of other prescription pharmaceuticals available on a regular basis and all the prices will be very competitive if not lower than anything comparable on SR at the moment. I will only be able to do UK - UK to start with but will look at shipping further afield if interest in the product becomes greater.<br /><br />I know my vendor account will have a different user name but as no one else seems to have access to this prescription med it should be easily recognised when it comes online.<br /><br />&nbsp;If anyone can help me with the account set up it will be greatly appreciated especially if you like opiates or zopiclone&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;)

				Read the Buyer&#039;s Guide, then the Seller&#039;s Guide, then the F.A.Q.<br /><br />They are all available on the SR Wiki which you will find here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Libertas
