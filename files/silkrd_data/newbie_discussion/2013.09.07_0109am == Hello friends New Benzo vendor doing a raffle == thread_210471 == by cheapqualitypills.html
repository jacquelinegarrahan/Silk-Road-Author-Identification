				Hello<br /><br />I am a new benzo vendor. My goal is to offer cheap generics and quality service. <br /><br /><br /><br />I am also doing a raffle. If you would like to be included in it please reply to this forum post (a great way to spam to 50 posts at the same time). <br /><br />ONLY 1 reply per account. I will choose 8 winners that will get 25 pills of there choice mailed for completely free. I only ask that once they get there product they leave a unbiased review. <br /><br />If you have any questions you can contact me on me official SR page at: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/40f29f985a

				In order to show everyone I really do mean to bring cheap quality pills to SR.<br /><br />I have made two listings of Lorazepam and Alprazolam both in quantities of 250 pills. The pricing is 60USD before SR for Alprazolam and 45USD for Lorazepam before SR fees (since the fees change the pricing can fluctuate). <br /><br />Also the RAFFLE IS ALSO FOR 250 Pills of your choice of the two. I will be offering more benzo later this week. Before I make any more listings I have to deal with a personal health problem. <br /><br />Overall I hope these low prices will force other vendors from India to stop charging so much for generics. My goal is to drop the prices on Silk Road for Indian Generic medicine. We should be helping everyone from these big pharama companies that are ripping off everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey there, cheapqualitypills!<br /><br />What do you know? I happen to be a new buyer and I love benzos! Haha. What do you say we start a beautiful friendship?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I also love writing. So, writing a review would be no problem at all. In fact, it&#039;d be fun.

				I&#039;m not trying to badmouth you or what you&#039;re doing but everyone should be wary about buying drugs that are produced in India. Before you blast me, look it up.<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason the wealthy Indian population will spend $30 for a bottle of GENERIC U.S. produced bottle of tylenol....<br /><br />Again, not putting you down or your business but just want my fellow community members to stay safe as always

I also wouldn&#039;t recommend buying from this person until said reviews. 1. because those are ridiculously cheap prices, and yeah, we heard your reason for saying as such but, Mr. or Mrs. Random person on the internet, you&#039;re just a random Mr. or Mrs. Random person on the internet. Not trying to be cynical, is just that it&#039;s a BIG thing to scam people on here because...well...what are the people that get scammed gonna do? Call the cops? Haha.<br /><br />&nbsp;No offense, OP.&nbsp; You could be a good guy or gal for all I know. It&#039;s just better to be safe than sorry.
