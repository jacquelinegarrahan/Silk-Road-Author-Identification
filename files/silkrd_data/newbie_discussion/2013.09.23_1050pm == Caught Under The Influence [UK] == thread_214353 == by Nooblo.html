				Hi SR<br />I live in the UK and plan on taking some ecstasy at the weekend. Every other time I&#039;ve taken ex I&#039;ve been at a house party or somewhere I was certain there would be a low police presence. This time I&#039;m going to the city center for a night out and I know there will be police everywhere. As far as I&#039;m aware I can&#039;t be charged unless I&#039;m in possession of the pills, so if I&#039;ve already eaten them am I right in saying I can&#039;t be charged with anything or lifted?<br /><br />I know I&#039;m being paranoid, but the paranoid are the people who won&#039;t get caught :P

				I&#039;d be more worried about the door staff at clubs and bars you go to as you will be getting searched at some if not all of them depending on the city.

				Ok seeing as nobody has given you a proper answer...<br />You can&#039;t be charged with a crime by being under the influence of drugs (unless you are driving or acting &#039;anti-socially&#039;).<br />The crime is possession. there was a legal precedent where the drug stated &#039;if a man has a glass of whiskey in his hand he is in possession of it, once he has drunk it it is no longer in his possession&#039; or words to that effect. So you are fine so long as you do not have drugs on you, police have no right to drug test people in UK.

				Police don&#039;t just stop people on nights out. They&#039;re on the look out for underage drinking, drug dealing and drunken violence not paradroid ekto heads. <br /><br />Seriously, doormen should be your main concern on a night out with drugs as they will search you and even if they don&#039;t find anything will very likely refuse you if you&#039;re off your tits. If they do find something they can hold you there til cops come to arrest you but it&#039;s unlikely, they probably just take your drugs and chuck you out then warn the other doors in the area about you.<br /><br />After door people your next concern should be local hard men out to punch a tourist&#039;s lights out. <br /><br />Don&#039;t try to take pills into clubs without eating them first and you should be fine.

There&#039;s no laws against being high in the UK, just possession.

				Just for those wondering in the united states:<br /><br />I am a lawyer, even though I dont practice locally :) (passed bar just to prove to myself)<br /><br />Your blood, your hair, your sweat, your urine and your spit is YOUR property. They cannot take this from you without YOUR permission, as long as you are ABLE To tell them NO, that you are NOT under the influence (and it doesnt sound extremely slurred).<br /><br />The LSD guy had his urine and his blood taken because he made them have probable cause to think he was incapacitated to uphold his rights. He didn&#039;t tell them otherwise and he didnt have a viable excuse for why he was lethargic, for instance &quot;I take pain medications for my knee&quot;. If you can say that sentence and that you are not under the influence of any NON PRESCRIPTION drugs, you have just built your defense if they decide to break the law and take your personal effects (blood, urine, spit, etc). <br />The reason you must be able to say something abide to keep your personal effects to yourself is:<br /><br />Say you are in a car accident and unconscious; there are very few injuries and none severe (as they find out earlier or later in hospital) BUT your breathing stops anyway. They have to know the cause for your breathing to stop to be able to counteract it, for example, when you overdosed and caused the car crash. The personal property law is for your rights but the exemptions for officers/EMT&#039;s is there for your safety, to allow them to get around this law to save your life.<br /><br />Yes, alot of cops are using this law unwarranted, as an excuse to incriminate you. Therefore, if you follow the advice I&#039;ve given above and they break it to get your biological property, to then charge you for DUI, you have a defense when you go to court as to WHY they had no probable cause to take your biological property - because you were able to COHERENTLY say &quot;No, Im not under influence; I am (sleepy or eyes constricted or etc) because I take medications for pain or muscle relaxers&quot; .&nbsp; By you being able to REMEMBER exactly what you said when the officer arrested you is proof right there, aiding that you were not lethargic. <br /><br />If you are under 18 in the US, you have NONE Of these rights. if you are driving and a police officer pulls you over at age of 16 and he thinks you are under influence of narcotics, he can make you give your personal property to him (blood, urine, whatever); If you are emancipated, however, this doesnt apply to you, as you have FULL rights of an eighteen year old.<br /><br />Of course, if you are drunk and you refuse simple breathalyzer (in Virginia) that is automatic admission of guilt for DUI, by Virginia law. <br /><br />So, dont drive drunk and dont drive more than your limit of narcotics. Ask a friend if you are too lethargic to drive; ask them to watch as you run toward an obstacle and try to dodge it at the last second. If you run into it, you&#039;re too lethargic. :)
