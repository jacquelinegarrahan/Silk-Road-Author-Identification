This feature is basically the equivalent of &#039;ncat<br />&nbsp; --sh-exec &quot;lua &lt;scriptname&gt;&quot;&#039; and allows you to run Lua scripts with Ncat,<br />&nbsp; redirecting all stdin and stdout operations to the socket connection. See<br />&nbsp; http://nmap.org/book/ncat-man-command-options.html [Jacek Wielemborek]<br /><br />o Integrated all of your IPv4 OS fingerprint submissions since January<br />&nbsp; (1,300 of them). Added 91 fingerprints, bringing the new total to 4,118.<br />&nbsp; Additions include Linux 3.7, iOS 6.1, OpenBSD 5.3, AIX 7.1, and more.<br />&nbsp; Many existing fingerprints were improved. Highlights:<br />&nbsp; http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q2/519. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Integrated all of your service/version detection fingerprints submitted<br />&nbsp; since January (737 of them)! Our signature count jumped by 273 to 8,979.<br />&nbsp; We still detect 897 protocols, from extremely popular ones like http, ssh,<br />&nbsp; smtp and imap to the more obscure airdroid, gopher-proxy, and<br />&nbsp; enemyterritory. Highlights:<br />&nbsp; http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q3/80. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Integrated your latest IPv6 OS submissions and corrections. We&#039;re still<br />&nbsp; low on IPv6 fingerprints, so please scan any IPv6 systems you own or<br />&nbsp; administer and submit them to http://nmap.org/submit/.&nbsp; Both new<br />&nbsp; fingerprints (if Nmap doesn&#039;t find a good match) and corrections (if Nmap<br />&nbsp; guesses wrong) are useful. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [Nsock] Added initial proxy support to Nsock. Nmap version detection<br />&nbsp; and NSE can now establish TCP connections through chains of one or<br />&nbsp; more CONNECT or SOCKS4 proxies. Use the Nmap --proxies option with a<br />&nbsp; chain of one or more proxies as the argument (example:<br />&nbsp; http://localhost:8080,socks4://someproxy.example.com). Note that<br />&nbsp; only version detection and NSE are supported so far (no port<br />&nbsp; scanning or host discovery), and there are other limitations<br />&nbsp; described in the man page. [Henri Doreau]<br /><br />o [NSE] Added 14 NSE scripts from 6 authors, bringing the total up to 446.<br />&nbsp; They are all listed at http://nmap.org/nsedoc/, and the summaries are<br />&nbsp; below (authors are listed in brackets):<br /><br />&nbsp; + hostmap-ip2hosts finds hostnames that resolve to the target&#039;s IP address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by querying the online database at http://www.ip2hosts.com (uses Bing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; search results) [Paulino Calderon]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-adobe-coldfusion-apsa1301 attempts to exploit an authentication<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bypass vulnerability in Adobe Coldfusion servers (APSA13-01:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa13-01.html) to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; retrieve a valid administrator&#039;s session cookie. [Paulino Calderon]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-coldfusion-subzero attempts to retrieve version, absolute path of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; administration panel and the file &#039;password.properties&#039; from vulnerable<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; installations of ColdFusion 9 and 10. [Paulino Calderon]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-comments-displayer extracts and outputs HTML and JavaScript<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; comments from HTTP responses. [George Chatzisofroniou]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-fileupload-exploiter exploits insecure file upload forms in web<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; applications using various techniques like changing the Content-type<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; header or creating valid image files containing the payload in the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; comment. [George Chatzisofroniou]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal exploits a directory traversal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl1 (and possibly other versions) to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; retrieve remote files on the web server. [Alexey Meshcheryakov]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-stored-xss posts specially crafted strings to every form it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; encounters and then searches through the website for those strings to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; determine whether the payloads were successful. [George Chatzisofroniou]<br /><br />&nbsp; + http-vuln-cve2013-0156 detects Ruby on Rails servers vulnerable to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; object injection, remote command executions and denial of service<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; attacks. (CVE-2013-0156) [Paulino Calderon]<br /><br />&nbsp; + ike-version obtains information (such as vendor and device type where<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; available) from an IKE service by sending four packets to the host.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This scripts tests with both Main and Aggressive Mode and sends multiple<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; transforms per request. [Jesper Kueckelhahn]<br /><br />&nbsp; + murmur-version detects the Murmur service (server for the Mumble voice<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; communication client) versions 1.2.X. [Marin Maržić]<br /><br />&nbsp; + mysql-enum performs valid-user enumeration against MySQL server using a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bug discovered and published by Kingcope<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/9). [Aleksandar Nikolic]<br /><br />&nbsp; + teamspeak2-version detects the TeamSpeak 2 voice communication server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and attempts to determine version and configuration information. [Marin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maržić]<br /><br />&nbsp; + ventrilo-info detects the Ventrilo voice communication server service<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; versions 2.1.2 and above and tries to determine version and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; configuration information. [Marin Maržić]<br /><br />o Updated the Nmap license agreement to close some loopholes and stop some<br />&nbsp; abusers. It&#039;s particularly targeted at companies which distribute<br />&nbsp; malware-laden Nmap installers as we caught Download.com doing last<br />&nbsp; year--http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html. The updated<br />&nbsp; license is in the all the normal places, including<br />&nbsp; https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING.<br /><br />o [NSE] Oops, there was a vulnerability in one of our 437 NSE scripts.&nbsp; If<br />&nbsp; you ran the (fortunately non-default) http-domino-enum-passwords script<br />&nbsp; with the (fortunately also non-default) domino-enum-passwords.idpath<br />&nbsp; parameter against a malicious server, it could cause an arbitrarily named<br />&nbsp; file to to be written to the client system. Thanks to Trustwave researcher<br />&nbsp; Piotr Duszynski for discovering and reporting the problem.&nbsp; We&#039;ve fixed<br />&nbsp; that script, and also updated several other scripts to use a new<br />&nbsp; stdnse.filename_escape function for extra safety. This breaks our record<br />&nbsp; of never having a vulnerability in the 16 years that Nmap has existed, but<br />&nbsp; that&#039;s still a fairly good run! [David, Fyodor]<br /><br />o Unicast CIDR-style IPv6 range scanning is now supported, so you can<br />&nbsp; specify targets such as en.wikipedia.org/120.&nbsp; Obviously it will take ages<br />&nbsp; if you specify a huge space.&nbsp; For example, a /64 contains<br />&nbsp; 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o It&#039;s now possible to mix IPv4 range notation with CIDR netmasks in target<br />&nbsp; specifications. For example, 192.168-170.4-100,200.5/16 is effectively the<br />&nbsp; same as 192.168.168-170.0-255.0-255. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Timeout script-args are now standardized to use the timespec that Nmap&#039;s<br />&nbsp; command-line arguments take (5s, 5000ms, 1h, etc.). Some scripts that<br />&nbsp; previously took an integer number of milliseconds will now treat that as a<br />&nbsp; number of seconds if not explicitly denoted as ms. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o Nmap may now partially rearrange its target list for more efficient<br />&nbsp; host groups. Previously, a single target with a different interface,<br />&nbsp; or with an IP address the same as a that of a target already in the<br />&nbsp; group, would cause the group to be broken off at whatever size it<br />&nbsp; was. Now, we buffer a small number of such targets, and keep looking<br />&nbsp; through the input for more targets to fill out the current group.<br />&nbsp; [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [Ncat] The -i option (idle timeout) now works in listen mode as well as<br />&nbsp; connect mode. [Tomas Hozza]<br /><br />o [Ncat] Ncat now support chained certificates with the --ssl-cert<br />&nbsp; option. [Greg Bailey]<br /><br />o [Nping] Nping now checks for a matching ICMP ID on echo replies, to avoid<br />&nbsp; receiving crosstalk from other ping programs running at the same<br />&nbsp; time. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [NSE] The ipOps.isPrivate library now considers the deprecated site-local<br />&nbsp; prefix fec0::/10 to be private. [Marek Majkowski]<br /><br />o Nmap&#039;s routing table is now sorted first by netmask, then by metric.<br />&nbsp; Previously it was the other way around, which could cause a very general<br />&nbsp; route with a low metric to be preferred over a specific route with a<br />&nbsp; higher metric.<br /><br />o Routes are now sorted to prefer those with a lower metric. Retrieval of<br />&nbsp; metrics is supported only on Linux and Windows. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Fixed a byte-ordering problem on little-endian architectures when doing<br />&nbsp; idle scan with a zombie that uses broken ID increments.&nbsp; [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Stop parsing TCP options after reaching EOL in libnetutil. Bug reported by<br />&nbsp; Gustavo Moreira. [Henri Doreau]<br /><br />o [NSE] The dns-ip6-arpa-scan script now optionally accepts &quot;/&quot; syntax for a<br />&nbsp; network mask. Based on a patch by Indula Nayanamith.<br /><br />o [Ncat] Reduced the default --max-conns limit from 100 to 60 on Windows, to<br />&nbsp; stay within platform limitations. Suggested by Andrey Olkhin.<br /><br />o Fixed IPv6 routing table alignment on NetBSD.<br /><br />o Fixed our NSEDoc system so the author field uses UTF-8 and we can spell<br />&nbsp; people&#039;s name properly, even if they use crazy non-ASCII characters like<br />&nbsp; Marin Maržić.&nbsp; [David Fifield]<br /><br />o UDP protocol payloads were added for detecting the Murmer service (a<br />&nbsp; server for the Mumble voice communication client) and TeamSpeak 2 VoIP<br />&nbsp; software.<br /><br />o [NSE] Added http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal by Alexey Meshcheryakov.<br /><br />o Updated libdnet to not SIOCIFNETMASK before SIOCIFADDR on OpenBSD. This<br />&nbsp; was reported to break on -current as of May 2013. [Giovanni Bechis]<br /><br />o Fixed address matching for SCTP (-PY) ping. [Marin Maržić]<br /><br />o Removed some non-ANSI-C strftime format strings (&quot;%F&quot;) and<br />&nbsp; locale-dependent formats (&quot;%c&quot;) from NSE scripts and libraries.<br />&nbsp; C99-specified %F was noticed by Alex Weber. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o [Zenmap] Improved internationalization support:<br />&nbsp; + Added Polish translation by Jacek Wielemborek.<br />&nbsp; + Updated the Italian translation. [Giacomo]<br /><br />o [Zenmap] Fixed internationalization files. Running in a language other<br />&nbsp; than the default English would result in the error &quot;ValueError: too many<br />&nbsp; values to unpack&quot;. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [NSE] Updated the included Liblua from version 5.2.1 to 5.2.2. [Patrick<br />&nbsp; Donnelly]<br /><br />o [Nsock] Added a minimal regression test suite for Nsock. [Henri Doreau]<br /><br />o [NSE] Updated the redis-brute and redis-info scripts to work against the<br />&nbsp; latest versions of redis server. [Henri Doreau]<br /><br />o [Ncat] Fixed errors in connecting to IPv6 proxies. [Joachim Henke]<br /><br />o [NSE] Updated hostmap-bfk to work with the latest version of their website<br />&nbsp; (bfk.de). [Paulino Calderon]<br /><br />o [NSE] Added XML structured output support to:<br />&nbsp; + xmpp-info, irc-info, sslv2, address-info [Daniel Miller]<br />&nbsp; + hostmap-bfk, hostmap-robtex, hostmap-ip2hosts. [Paulino Calderon]<br />&nbsp; + http-git.nse. [Alex Weber]<br /><br />o Added new service probes for:<br />&nbsp; + Erlang distribution nodes [Michael Schierl]<br />&nbsp; + Minecraft servers. [Eric Davisson]<br />&nbsp; + Hazelcast data grid. [Pavel Kankovsky]<br /><br />o [NSE] Rewrote telnet-brute for better compatibility with a variety of<br />&nbsp; telnet servers. [nnposter]<br /><br />o Fixed a regression that changed the number of delimiters in machine<br />&nbsp; output. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o Fixed a regression in broadcast-dropbox-listener which prevented it from<br />&nbsp; producing output. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o Handle ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) responses to port scan probes.&nbsp; Ports<br />&nbsp; will be reported as &quot;filtered&quot;, to be consistent with existing Connect<br />&nbsp; scan results, and will have a reason of time-exceeded.&nbsp; DiabloHorn<br />&nbsp; reported this issue via IRC. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o Add new decoders (BROWSER, DHCP6 and LLMNR) to broadcast-listener and<br />&nbsp; changed output of some of the decoders slightly. [Patrik Karlsson]<br /><br />o The list of name servers on Windows now ignores those from inactive<br />&nbsp; interfaces. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Namespace the pipes used to communicate with subprocesses by PID, to avoid<br />&nbsp; multiple instances of Ncat from interfering with each other.&nbsp; Patch by<br />&nbsp; Andrey Olkhin.<br /><br />o [NSE] Changed ip-geolocation-geoplugin to use the web service&#039;s new output<br />&nbsp; format. Reported by Robin Wood.<br /><br />o Limited the number of open sockets in ultra_scan to FD_SETSIZE. Very fast<br />&nbsp; connect scans could write past the end of an fd_set and cause a variety of<br />&nbsp; crashes:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; nmap: scan_engine.cc:978: bool ConnectScanInfo::clearSD(int):<br />Assertion `numSDs &gt; 0&#039; failed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; select failed in do_one_select_round(): Bad file descriptor (9)<br />&nbsp; [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Fixed a bug that prevented Nmap from finding any interfaces when one of<br />&nbsp; them had the type ARP_HDR_APPLETALK; this was the case for AppleTalk<br />&nbsp; interfaces. However, This support is not complete since AppleTalk<br />&nbsp; interfaces use different size hardware addresses than Ethernet.&nbsp; Nmap IP<br />&nbsp; level scans should work without any problem, please refer to the<br />&nbsp; &#039;--send-ip&#039; switch and to the following thread:<br />&nbsp; http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/214.&nbsp; This bug was reported by Steven<br />&nbsp; Gregory Johnson. [Daniel Miller]<br /><br />o [Nping] Nping on Windows now skips localhost targets for privileged pings<br />&nbsp; on (with an error message) because those generally don&#039;t work.&nbsp; [David<br />&nbsp; Fifield]<br /><br />o [Ncat] Ncat now keeps running in connect mode after receiving EOF from the<br />&nbsp; remote socket, unless --recv-only is in effect.&nbsp; [Tomas Hozza]<br /><br />o Packet trace of ICMP packets now include the ICMP ID and sequence number<br />&nbsp; by default. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [NSE] Fixed various NSEDoc bugs found by David Matousek.<br /><br />o [Zenmap] Zenmap now understands the NMAP_PRIVILEGED and NMAP_UNPRIVILEGED<br />&nbsp; environment variables. [Tyler Wagner]<br /><br />o Added an ncat_assert macro.&nbsp; This is similar to assert(), but remains even<br />&nbsp; if NDEBUG is defined. Replaced all Ncat asserts with this. We also moved<br />&nbsp; operation with side effects outside of asserts as yet another layer of<br />&nbsp; bug-prevention [David Fifield].<br /><br />o Added nmap-fo.xsl, contributed by Tilik Ammon. This converts Nmap XML into<br />&nbsp; XSL-FO, which can be converted into PDF using tools suck as Apache FOP.<br /><br />o Increased the number of slack file descriptors not used during connect<br />&nbsp; scan. Previously, the calculation did not consider the descriptors used by<br />&nbsp; various open log files. Connect scans using a lot of sockets could fail<br />&nbsp; with the message &quot;Socket creation in sendConnectScanProbe: Too many open<br />&nbsp; files&quot;. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Changed the --webxml XSL stylesheet to point to the new location of<br />&nbsp; nmap.xsl in the new repository (https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.xsl).<br />&nbsp; It still may not work in web browsers due to same origin policy (see<br />&nbsp; http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/58). [David Fifield, Simon John]<br /><br />o [NSE] The vulnerability library can now preserve vulnerability information<br />&nbsp; across multiple ports of the same host. The bug was reported by<br />&nbsp; iphelix. [Djalal Harouni]<br /><br />o Removed the undocumented -q option, which renamed the nmap process to<br />&nbsp; something like &quot;pine&quot;.<br /><br />o Moved the Japanese man page from man1/jp to man1/ja. JP is a country code<br />&nbsp; while JA is a language code. Reported by Christian Neukirchen.<br /><br />o [Nsock] Reworked the logging infrastructure to make it more flexible and<br />&nbsp; consistent. Updated Nmap, Nping and Ncat accordingly. Nsock log level can<br />&nbsp; now be adjusted at runtime by pressing d/D in nmap.&nbsp; [Henri Doreau, David<br />&nbsp; Fifield]<br /><br />o [NSE] Fixed scripts using unconnected UDP sockets. The bug was reported by<br />&nbsp; Dhiru Kholia at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/422. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Made some changes to Ndiff to reduce parsing time when dealing with large<br />&nbsp; Nmap XML output files. [Henri Doreau]<br /><br />o Clean up the source code a bit to resolve some false positive issues<br />&nbsp; identified by the Parfait static code analysis program. Oracle apparently<br />&nbsp; runs this on programs (including Nmap) that they ship with Solaris.&nbsp; See<br />&nbsp; http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/504. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [Zenmap] Fixed a crash that could be caused by opening the About dialog,<br />&nbsp; using the window manager to close it, and opening it again.&nbsp; This was<br />&nbsp; reported by Yashartha Chaturvedi and Jordan Schroeder.&nbsp; [David Fifield]<br /><br />o [Ncat] Made test-addrset.sh exit with nonzero status if any tests<br />&nbsp; fail. This in turn causes &quot;make check&quot; to fail if any tests fail.<br />&nbsp; [Andreas Stieger]<br /><br />o Fixed compilation with --without-liblua. The bug was reported by Rick<br />&nbsp; Farina, Nikos Chantziaras, and Alex Turbov. [David Fifield]<br /><br />o Fixed CRC32c calculation (as used in SCTP scans) on 64-bit<br />&nbsp; platforms. [Pontus Andersson]<br /><br />o [NSE] Added multicast group name output to<br />&nbsp; broadcast-igmp-discovery.nse. [Vasily Kulikov]<br /><br />o [NSE] Added new fingerprints for http-enum: Sitecore, Moodle, typo3,<br />&nbsp; SquirrelMail, RoundCube.
