				Did my first order last week thru SuperSun, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect but I ordered on Wednesday 1 g super tar. I was expecting to wait all thru the weekend and thought Monday earliest it would arrive. So i get out work Friday and sulk to the mailbox just to torture myself and blam, the package was waiting form me. The supertar was awesome I&#039;m on a maintenance med and it broke thru fairly easily, overall good experience and good product, great for chasing. Needless to say it was a good weekend, its been awhile.&nbsp; Just ordered another g,&nbsp; hope its the same as last time.

				&nbsp;I just got my first order from Purest, and I know its comparing apples and oranges (ok maybe Kumquats and Mandarians) but I only have SuperSun&#039;s &#039;Super Tar&#039; to compare to. Purest did follow thru with what he said and I got my express order in a reasonable amount of time. Its decent tar ( I chase and my tube doesn&#039;t show much residue compared to Supersun&#039;s). Strength wise Supersun&#039;s product was slightly stronger, 1 G lasted me three days and the powdery consistency was defintely easier to deal with than Purest&#039;s Tar. I am on about 1-2 mg&#039;s of Suboxone which I didn&#039;t take today when trying Purest&#039;s and I feel pretty good after chasing about 200 mg&#039;s. All in all both were good sellers, they got the item to me in a decent amount of time and stealth was good. Given a choice I would go with Supersuns just for ease of handling the powder and strength but Purest does come with a good product for slightly cheaper.

				I can vouch that purest&#039;s BTH is pretty good, but all of a sudden he is AWOL - just warning anyone who might dig up this thread.. guy disappeared and orders 2 weeks &#039;in transit&#039; are waiting.<br /><br />Hope he comes back okay.<br /><br />I wanted to try supersun&#039;s stuff but he wouldn&#039;t answer a PGP message, so no sale.
