				I would love to open a shop somewhere in a major city where customers can only pay by bitcoin for the goods I am selling. Does anyone have any insight or knowledge in the legalities of that? Our monetary system right now is the biggest issue society faces and I think this would be a start to pushing it.

				I guess you would have to look into the laws of what types of currency can be transacted in your country. <br /><br />I mean logistically it is more work to get bitcoins to purchase things with unless you are just mining them and have them all the time. To me it would always be worth it more if I could just pay in cash. It stinks having to cash them out and buy them. Seems like more work than necessary. But, an online shop would be a nice way to have your business paid by bitcoins be able to take off. My 2 cents

				You would have to worry bout the volatility of bitcoins . On SR vendors can hedge their prices so they don&#039;t take a beatin .

				My idea was to price things at local currency rate and convert the price live at the checkout. You can accept the payment using a qr code so people can pay with their phone. I was just wondering if it was legal.
