				It certainly isn&#039;t weed from what I have seen so far but the strain selection is making my mouth water. I will be buying to supplement something special to my normal mids.

				Designer drugs like MDMA are by far the cheapest on the road. Prescriptions are pretty pricey, as is the LSD &amp; Coke. Most people (myself included) would say MDMA is the best drug by far; as it lasts very long and stimulates the best feeling i can describe. Thats my $.02 though

There&#039;s even a guy who sells US domestic pure alprazolam powder for about $200 a gram! Other pure powders of pharmaceuticals can be found as well (diazepam, tramadol, fentanyl, etc.)<br /><br />But seriously painkillers are fucking ridiculous on here. Yea I understand a dollar a milligram (still a high price for what I&#039;m used to) if you&#039;re buying one or two Oxy&#039;s, but no price breaks even if you get 10 or more? Fuck that. Heroin is more bang for your buck than that (no pun intended&nbsp; :P). A lot more...<br /><br />LSD and blow are also a little overpriced too, but the coke on here is usually worth the price from what I&#039;ve heard as long as you&#039;re not trying to resell. And it&#039;s not like I can even find any acid locally, my area gets only like one overpriced batch a year if we&#039;re lucky.

				GHB is the strongest drug for your money.<br /><br />10 eurocent will be enough to put you in a deep sleep, For real !!!<br /><br />You will have to make it yourself, otherwise you will be paying 5 euros for the 10 ml that is 10 eurocents worth.<br /><br /><br />With 100 euro you can make 2000ml.<br />You only need 5ml<br />So you will be having fun 400 times for just 100 euro<br /><br />Start with 3 ml or 4 ml, and have someone with you.<br /><br />When you take 5 ml and you have to vomit, you could drown.<br />Your friend can put you in a save position, to save your life.<br />

				My favorite things that I&#039;ve bought from SR would have to be MDMA and 25i-NBOME. Both really great experiences with them, vendors included.

				If you like psychedelics, the RCs are a pretty damn good deal on here (vs. many clearnet vendors), especially the nbome&#039;s.

				25i is cheaper than dirt because of the influx of Chinese suppliers pushing nearly 99.5% pure powder.&nbsp; At least with it you know it&#039;s pure and it&#039;s gonna be cheap.&nbsp; China has cornered the market on RC&#039;s it&#039;s ridiculous how cheap you can get a barrel imported for.

				NBOMe&#039;s are pretty cheap here, but on RC forums you can find it for cheaper&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen them go for as low as $50 a gram, which is potentially 1000+ doses depending on how much you like to take.
