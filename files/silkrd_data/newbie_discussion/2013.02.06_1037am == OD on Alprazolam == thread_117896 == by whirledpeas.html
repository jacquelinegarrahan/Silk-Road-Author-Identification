				So, I had a few substances around I didn&#039;t really want just you know, laying around, so I decided, &quot;Well they gotta go sometime&quot;, so I grabbed a bag (was supposed to be MDMA, I believed from former tests it was just weak meph&nbsp; but anyway... waste not, want not.&nbsp; I decided to set back (in a pretty dark room) and I *THOUGHT* I knew which bag I was dosing out of.&nbsp; Well, after the second print (licked finger), I realized this stuff didn&#039;t taste nearly as bad as as the meph I thought I was doing.&nbsp; I quickly realized I was doing prints of pure alprazolam :(&nbsp; Once I had realize what I had done an, &quot;Oh shit&quot; moment came over me #1 thinking, damnit I was just trying to get rid of some old drugs that didn&#039;t even seem to work anyway, and here I am eating my expensive alprazolam like I was taking prints of molly. <br /><br />TL DR; So I&#039;m guessing I&#039;ve had between 70-120 mg Alprazolam powder by mistake.&nbsp; I know this isn&#039;t life threatening or anything, but how long is this going to last, and I&#039;m I just going to be tired and have no motor skills (and memories)?<br /><br /><br />BTW, I am normally the super carefully person.. I have milli scales and the whole works, this is the first time I can think I ever fucked up in this manner before, and will never ever do again. and the alprazolam was potent within tolerance for being pure (90%+)<br /><br />it took me an hour+ to write this................<br /><br />Adice?<br /><br />+1.5 hrs I feel real warm and fuzzy .... and tired

				IDk everyone is different, i smashed it for about 2 months and when i eventually threw away my powder <br />i went through the worst physical withdrawals, it was in no way mental,the last thing i wanted was more xanax<br /><br />its like feeling reallllly sick but in reality your not sick, its just this benzo leaving your system<br /><br /><br />stick to the 2 day rule.never take that shit for more than 2 days in a row

				By itself Alprazolam isn&#039;t particularly dangerous in regards to overdose potential but mixed with stimulant drugs it can kill you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had one friend die from a combination of Alprazolam (Oral) and Methamphetamine (Smoked) and then a couple of years later I had a second friend die from a combination of MDMA (Snorted), Ketamine (Snorted) &amp; Alprazolam (Oral). I&#039;ve also had an extremely bad experience using Alprazolam to try and take the edge of a MDPV binge, it didn&#039;t do what I thought it would (Relax me) and instead made me feel extremely dysphoric and depressed, and worsened the heart palpitations I was having from the MDPV.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL WITH THESE COMBINATIONS!!

A close friend of mine has a tolerance of like 80mg of Xanax per day, &amp; no rehabs will admit him unless he somehow significantly lowers his tolerance on his own first... Even Detox Centers consider him to be too much of a liability. <br /><br />Heroin withdrawal is mostly physical, meth withdrawal is mostly psychological, &amp; severe Benzo withdrawal is an even worse version of both combined. Such a high percentage of people have killed themselves when withdrawaling from Benzos that in many states you can usually get a 10 day Benzo script from the hospital ER if you&#039;re going through severe Benzo withdrawal, regardless of the reason why.

				You would have to eat handfulls of them coupled with alcohol, or some other depressant to actually OD and die from xanax. <br /><br />But Xanax is a strong fucking drug, they need to be used with serious caution, to avoid health issues. Withdrawals, temper tantrums, loss of memory, and a butt load of other negative side effects.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				What kind of emotional state makes one take Xanax/Alprazolam?<br />I&#039;ve read so much about the withdrawal that I would never touch it.<br />What does it do other drugs can&#039;t?<br />
