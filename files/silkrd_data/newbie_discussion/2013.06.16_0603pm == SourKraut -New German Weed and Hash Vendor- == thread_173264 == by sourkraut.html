				Hi,<br /><br />last week I ordered 25g of SourKraut&#039;s SuperSkunk. He allowed me to stay in Escrow and shipped it the same day I ordered. It arrived in 2 days domestic. Stealth is standard, nothing fancy, but alright.<br />Weed was slightly overweight, one big 8g bud and rest were smaller buds, no small shizzle received, only buds.<br /><br />Communication was good, he always replied quickly within hours.<br /><br />The weed itself:<br />The weed isn&#039;t dense like in the product description, it&#039;s very fluffy and lightweight. The weed is dry and easy to crumble, I crumbled 0.4g for my first joint, and due to the fluffyness the 0.4g looked more like 0.6g, so I didn&#039;t have to mix in that much tobacco. Taste is typical skunk and it gives a good stoned effect. All in all I would recommend SourKraut as a vendor and his weed, good weed for a good price!<br /><br />I have yet to try his Amnesia.

				Hey,<br /><br />I was just thinking about ordering here but then I saw the stats - what the fuck happened here? Haven&#039;t you guys been near to 100 a few days ago?<br />Furthermore, when scrolling through the last 10 feedback pages ( I guess there are not more, since 103 transactions ) I only found one 1/5 and two 4/5, how can that result in 91.7%?<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />PS: where are all the german weed vendors that sell for &#039;normal&#039; prices? (hazebusta, karotte, naturalweed, everybody looks like a scammer, and budsupplies is quite pricy :D)

				Ordered 75g of his skunk a while ago, it was pretty decent. I received it in 2 days domestic and the weed itself was great-looking aswell. It gave you a nice high and for that price it is totally fair.<br />The packaging is alright, there is nothing to complain because it is sufficient. Overall I can only recommend his service, I will buy again someday.

				Konnichiwa,<br /><br />man i would totally recommend this vendor! Im on the road only for a few month, and I kinda tested almost all german vendors THC products which are interesting for me. Since I dont wanna do business with hazebusta again (Dont get me wrong, only had positive experiences with him, but FE is still a pain in the ass) and budsupplies is SO FREAKIN expensive, i thought i give sourkraut a shot. So I ordered some of the maroccan super polm..delivered very fast, good stealth, very impressive quality, but a little underweight. So why do i recommend him if i got an underweight product? Well, he contacted me after my feedback and offered a free sample to make it up... you know, we are all humans, and mistakes happen, but the way my &quot;problem&quot; was solved totally shows me why I should stick to SR and I guess thats what good service is about.<br /><br />cheers, schreckse

				I ordered some Maroccan Super Polm Hash 2 weeks ago. It was my very first order I&#039;ve on the Road. Obviously I had to finalize early which made me a bit nervous at first. But this vendor can be trusted! I got it 2 days after my domestic order, the stealth was okay and the hash was vacuum sealed. After I weighted it I&#039;ve noticed he gave me 0.1g overweight. For this bombass hash this is enough to send you to the moon ;)<br />It&#039;s really soft and melts like chocolate! And the effects are just wonderful. Really warm and smooth stony high with not much paranoia.<br />It&#039;s a good contact with a nice product, surely I will order from this vendor again.

				&nbsp;8)<br /><br />Hi i ordered some weeks ago the super pollen.<br /><br />Everything was fine. SourKraut delivered really fast, took less than 24h to arrive (domestic). The communication was also very fast and friendly. Stealth was nice, no smell at all. The product itself is very delicious. You get a strong hash for a really fair price. <br /><br />I can highly recommend that vendor and it won&#039;t be the last time i will order there !!<br />Keep up that good work SourKraut !!

				Well, I never ordered from this guy but I was asking myself the same question.<br />Just now, I somehow had the Idea that maybe this guy http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/32f253c269 (Mr Jaegermeister) might be the same guy?<br /><br />Dunno why, just have the feeling (listings look nearly the same, price range is the same, the nick indicates it in some way).<br /><br />Does anybody have any clue if this might be true?<br /><br />cheers
