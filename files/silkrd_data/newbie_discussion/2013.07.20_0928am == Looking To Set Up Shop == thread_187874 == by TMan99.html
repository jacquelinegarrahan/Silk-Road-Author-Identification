				I have been a long time buyer and am now looking to set up shop as things settle down and I save the appropriate amount of money to start in the next month.<br /><br />I am looking into selling digital items, and tanagible items that don&#039;t reek (I wont be selling any drugs). This is all still in the works.<br /><br />My major concerns are quite obviously my anonmity aswell as the abillity to be able to cover my ass if I were to ever get raided (obviously I would need to do everything I can to prevent this also). To the point where there would be no traces of SR in my life.<br /><br />Then also having my connections not know who I am - in the case where they turn themselves in to LE ( For Example: Having others accept my large quantity orders, or being able to open an anonymous mail box which I am able to dump and change often)<br /><br />Turning my BTC into Gold or Silver, and storing it<br /><br />Etc...<br /><br />You guys know all the appropriate steps a vendor must take to protect themselve <br /><br />Hopefully some of you have links, can offer some help, and I will even be looking to hire a consultent (My spelling sucks) as I build up the funds and get closer to opening<br />Post away, please

				They tried <br />Electronics here sell very bad and you would get better selling them on ebay. I doubt that you can supply some dangerous or illegal electronics that would attract the people. And watch your language - thats not the kind vendor silk needs.<br />Cheers

				Why do you want everyone to hold your hand and help you set up shop to sell something that none of them give a rat&#039;s ass about?
