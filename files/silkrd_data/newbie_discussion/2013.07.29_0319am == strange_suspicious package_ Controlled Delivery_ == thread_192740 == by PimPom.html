				Hi, I&#039;m a newbie.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only made 3 SR purchases so far.&nbsp; All 3 have been domestic within the U.S.<br /><br />After the first two orders were delivered, but before the third arrived, I received one of those USPS pink slips in my mailbox informing me a parcel was waiting for me at the post office -- as registered mail. <br /><br />I freaked out a little bit because I knew this wasn&#039;t normal.<br /><br />I decided to wait a few days to see if it was completely unrelated to SR.<br /><br />Sure enough, my third order came through normally to my mailbox.<br /><br />Yet...I am absolutely sure I did not order anything else from ANYBODY -- Silk Road or otherwise.<br /><br />The pink slip contains a code which indicates the parcel is from ARGENTINA.&nbsp; I know for DAMN sure I didn&#039;t order anything from Argentina.<br /><br />So my question is: is this just some freakish coincidence/fluke?<br /><br />Or is this some sneaky way for the Post Office to get me to show up and arrest me?<br /><br />Or am I just being paranoid?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Long Live Silk Road<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Odd my rule of thumb for SR is i dont pick up anything unless its in the mail box. If you got your package fuck the police start using different drops, it has sure helped me sleep at night. Of course if its just personal amount i would stop being paranoid. A little creativity keeps everyone safe!

				Yeah, everything has been small personal amounts.<br /><br />I do know they have left slips for me before when a package was too big to fit in the mailbox.&nbsp; Then again, they have also left packages at my front door, as they did with my first SR order (priority mail).<br /><br />I&#039;m probably paranoid, but now I&#039;m thinking my address got mixed up with one vendor or another and they shipped me a large package by mistake.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I just know I didn&#039;t order anything from Argentina lately.<br /><br />&nbsp;:-\<br /><br />

				that shit is crazy.&nbsp; My opposite of expert opinion is the cops or feds aren&#039;t going to knowingly deliver you drugs and allow you take them.&nbsp; The liability is too high?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; If they wanted to arrest you, they already would have.&nbsp; I&#039;d wait a few days, then go pick it up.

				OP - By the sounds of it; you don&#039;t know what the package contains.&nbsp; Boom, infinite and LEGITIMATE plausible deniability.&nbsp; I would go down to the PO and inquire; a pink/peach slip is not a big deal.&nbsp; If it was a CD, they&#039;d come-a-knockin&#039; ... <br /><br />What if it&#039;s a Kilo of Cocaine and the PO doesn&#039;t know anything?&nbsp; Imagine how filthy rich you would be.&nbsp; <br /><br />As of right now, you didn&#039;t order it.&nbsp; So, what do you have to lose?&nbsp; If you go down there, and they act weird and are like &quot;wait one minute&quot; and someone with a badge or an inspector or post-master comes out asking questions, respond with the questions you currently have... <br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t know what it is... I had this slip saying I had a package, do you know what it is?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;I was not expecting something from Argentina, and I honestly don&#039;t know what it could be... Maybe I won something?&quot;&nbsp; lol<br /><br />Seriously though.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably something really stupid, and I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; You obviously didn&#039;t order it, so you have no reason to fear what it &#039;may&#039; be.&nbsp; In all likelihood, it&#039;s something silly.&nbsp; But, there&#039;s a small chance it could be cocaine. rofl

				Please don&#039;t listen to ill advice, a few things.<br /><br />1. Ask the vendor where your pack should have been marked as shipped from.<br /><br />2. When they leave a slip saying you need to come get it that means that it required a signature to get it and you were not there to provide that. They leave this asking you to come sign and pick it up at the office.<br /><br />3. I have picked up plenty of thee packs where the vendor forgets to waive the signature.<br /><br />4. Argentina without any notice is pretty sketch, unless your feeling really lucky or don&#039;t want to lose the $ on your pack I probably would call that one a loss.

A Peach slip most definitely does NOT mean that a signature is/was required.<br />A Peach Slip is simply the &quot;Sorry We Missed You!&quot; Notice, which are left entirely at the discretion of the postal worker who attempted the delivery.&nbsp; This usually depends on the size of the parcel, the surrounding environment at the time of delivery(if they believe no one is home and there are lots of people around), amongst any number of factors.&nbsp; This does not automatically mean you will need to sign anything; including the peach slip.<br /><br />3. ...<br /><br />4.

				Let&#039;s think about this a minute. Are the cops just going to wait around the post office for you to someday show up, and then nab you? If not, are they going to just let you walk off with the illicit substances (which would be caught on camera, you taking the drugs they let you have) and then sometime later expend resources to search your house for what you&#039;ve said was a small personal amount? I would just walk in there and pick it up, no sweat. You have total plausible deniability. They can&#039;t charge you with anything unless they can prove you ordered the goods or had some involvement. I know you already got your orders, but even if this was your doing, as long as the funding/encryption side is secure the worst that could happen is you&#039;re inconvenienced. I have signed for stuff at the post office and not been worried for these reasons.

				I wouldn&#039;t have given out such particulars on this open forum, or I would have changed the country from Argentina to somewhere else, just so it couldn&#039;t be linked with me. I&#039;d clean my house, go down and inquire about it. Like others have said, you have plausible deniability but I&#039;d still make sure you have no drugs in your house.

				if you got all your sr orders i dont think there is anything to worry about, its probably just something you ordered and forgot about or a postcard or some spam mail. can you call up and ask about it and ask who it says the return address is from?

				Your a fucking idiot if you deal with a black market website, receive a unexpected package from a 3rd world country, and then actually go to get it. <br /><br />Chances are if the person sending it was dumb enough to send it to the wrong person they are likely dumb enough not to use proper stealth, which leads to....<br /><br />wait for it....<br /><br />Controlled Delivery.<br /><br />&amp; Yes, they do leave peach/pinkish slips when you are required to sign as well as for what you mentioned, and yes CD&#039;s DO* happen at Post offices.

So it does not mean that you will have to sign for it, I didn&#039;t have to sign for either of the packages...<br /><br />You can solve this problem really easy...All you have to do is go to the PO and request a waiver form. I&#039;m not sure of the exact name of it, but I just explained that I wanted them to leave packages on the porch and she brought it out. You check a little box saying that you accept responsibility for packages that are left when you&#039;re not there. It even has a line to leave a note for the carriers, so I told them to put packages inside my storm door if I&#039;m not there. Signed it, an haven&#039;t had to go pick up anything since!

They would have likely picked it up(unless a signature was asked of them) brought it home, wrote &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on it, put it by the door.&nbsp; And already would have had the story planned for if someone came barging in the door. <br /><br /><br />But of course, my drops don&#039;t have laptops or pc&#039;s running Tor, browsing SR, stashing drugs, money, guns, etc.&nbsp; All, and I mean, ALL of my recipients are CLEAN.&nbsp; No Record WHAT-SO-EVER.&nbsp; So, there really isn&#039;t a lot of paranoia amongst my peeps.&nbsp; :/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wasn&#039;t calling YOU an idiot lol, I was calling the aforementioned theoretical 3rd party in questions an idiot!<br /><br />I use all the same precautions you do, what&#039;s your point? The point I&#039;m making is that you DO NOT pick up a pack that your not expecting, period.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No no, the point I am making is...&nbsp; Yes, yes you do.&nbsp; I had a friend of mine call me up one time saying he got a &quot;sketchy slip&quot; ...&nbsp; He was once a recipient for another dealer in my city who was working with [REDACTED] doing CTM; something I&#039;ve never been fond of.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, he said he got a knock at his door when he wasn&#039;t expecting anyone or anything. So being the type who never actually answer his door, he just waited for them to leave. He used to say &quot;it&#039;s almost always someone you don&#039;t want to see. Unless it&#039;s the mail man!&quot;&nbsp; lmfao - anyway, he went out to find a peach slip on his mailbox, and said he &quot;thinks&quot; he recognized the sender info from seeing [REDACTED]&#039;s packs before.&nbsp; He called up the other dealer just to BS with him, see if he made mention of anything, and the guy made no mention of anything to be expected.&nbsp; I believe he also said that it had been something like 2 or 3 months prior that he had even received anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Naturally, I told him, &quot;Well... you weren&#039;t expecting it... you aren&#039;t a drug dealer... know you have the deniability... I would check it out; don&#039;t sign for anything.&quot;&nbsp; And that he did...<br /><br />He went down to the Post Office the next morning w/ the slip, and they had a large priority flat rate from California sitting there waiting for him.&nbsp; No signature required.&nbsp; He called me all ecstatic and shit when he got home, and I told him to immediately write &quot;return to sender&quot; it w/ a sharpie and leave it by his door. <br /><br />Came by 3-4 days later, after nothing happened, and we opened it up in a secure location. When we opened it I knew right away it was from SR, or at least that it was weed.&nbsp; Turned out to be 2lbs.<br /><br />1 lb of shaky dry shit, and 1 lb of super-dank.<br /><br />... MY point is... you aren&#039;t incriminating yourself by going down to the Post Office to inquire. <br /><br /><br />I told him I wanted nothing to do with it, but the fact that a SR vendor had his info saved was pretty fucked up.&nbsp; He waited a week, jarred it up at one of my stash spots and there it sat the whole time.&nbsp; When nothing happened, he asked me to sell it for him, which I did.&nbsp; I believe I got him 7300 for it all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, I stopped talking to him cause he was kind of a shit-bag in that sense.&nbsp; He even tried to rip me off at some point after that... and from what I heard, 2 months later the other dealer came asking about if &quot;anything unusual showed up&quot;&nbsp; said [REDACTED] was harassing him about it, but he never knew about it, never told his drop about it, my buddy(at the time) acted like nothing ever came, and everyone just let it go... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that guy is my main competition. *and [REDACTED] and the other dealer who he was accepting packs for are both in jail, for cash through the mail. Again, something I&#039;ve never been fond of.<br /><br />CTM is risky as fuck.
