				I&#039;d like to give something back. Obviously TOR is very slow and besides the illegal traffic it can help people in censored countries.<br /><br />Does anyone have any advice on being a relay? Is it as simple as clicking &#039;Setup Relaying&#039; in Vidalia and choosing one of the options?<br /><br />Should I avoid being an exit relay? (why/why not)<br /><br />Are there any risks to me?<br /><br />Do I need to open ports in my firewall? Should I not do it while browsing SR?<br /><br />If anyone here does it I&#039;d appreciate any advice you can give.

				You do NOT want to be an exit relay.&nbsp; Google / startpage / whatever &quot;tor exit node child porn&quot; and read in horror at what happens to exit nodes in many countries.<br /><br />Being an in-network-only relay node is safe.&nbsp; Just make sure you&#039;ve got a firewall and no malware on your system, because you&#039;re likely to get a bunch of retarded script kiddies scanning you a dozen times a day (shouldn&#039;t do any harm -- never did to me, anyway).<br /><br />Just enable the option in Vidalia, and see if it works automatically.&nbsp; Most routers have support for UPnP (Universal Plug &amp; Play) these days, which lets programs dynamically tell your router they need an incoming port open for connections.

				Just don&#039;t run an exit node and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not comfortable doing it though, then don&#039;t.&nbsp; No big deal :)

				Don&#039;t worry too much, just use a good firewall and keep your own personal linking info regarding SR off of the computer and as for that cp bust I believe he was also producing the stuff...so don&#039;t do that, have a good firewall on a clean computer if possible and hopefully you should be just fine&nbsp; :D
