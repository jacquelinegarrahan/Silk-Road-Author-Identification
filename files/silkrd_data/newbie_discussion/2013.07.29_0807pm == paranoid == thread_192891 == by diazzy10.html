				Hi guys and girls, just saying hello,there seems to be alot of paranoid peeps on here not that theres anything wrong with being careful but from what i am seeing on these forums PARANOID how many buyers do you know of that have been nicked,do you really think le are interested in a punter buying a gram or two of coke or any other drug no i dont think so now maybe if your spending like a 1000 btc a week then yes your going to get looked at,i have been buying on here under a different id for 2 years and had all manner of drugs sent from all over the world with not even a missing package so just do your homework on your vendor and you should have no problems and the local bitcoins.com is very safe,just thought i would give a bit of help to anyone new to here so good luck and remember everything you do is about preperation and homework and if your in a rush i would go and see your street dealer, be patient good things come to those who wait
