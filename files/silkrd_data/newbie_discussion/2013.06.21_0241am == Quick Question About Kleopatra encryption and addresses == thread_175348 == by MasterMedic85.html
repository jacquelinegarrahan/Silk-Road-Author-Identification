				Sorry for the extremely basic question but I&#039;m overly cautious. When I ran a test encryption on my address through Kleopatra, the formatting went from:<br />Name<br />Address_1<br />City, State Zip<br /><br />to:<br />NameAddress_1City,StateZip<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had to worry about encryption formatting before but I want to make sure that my first order goes through without a hitch and the vendor understands the address. Will this cause any issues with the shipping or is stripping the formatting standard for encryption? If it&#039;s going to be a problem, any idea on what I did through Kleopatra to cause this? I couldn&#039;t find a setting to retain formatting. Thanks in advance for any help provided.

				Hm I&#039;m going to give mine a try again to see. I didn&#039;t notice that when I did it. Almost seems like maybe it&#039;s the CR/LF difference between Windows and Linux? What text editor are you using to create your file that you want to encrypt?<br /><br />Hm I just tried it again as a test; I didn&#039;t see the carriage returns/linefeeds disappear. Although Kleopatra seems not very user friendly. It seems more intended for encrypting images and other files rather than just plain text. And having to have the keys imported and stuff seems to make it a little harder to use.

				Kleopatra caused me a lot of grief when I initially started encrypting. I use GPG4USB now and haven&#039;t had any issues.

				Ah yes I see, GPG4USB is much easier to use for text files. Thanks for the tip!
