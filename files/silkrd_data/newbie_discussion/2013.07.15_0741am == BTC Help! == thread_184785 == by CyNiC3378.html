				Can anyone recommend a trusted vendor to purchase btc from? Ive been told to try LocalBitcoins.com but seems like they have minimal protection. My other issue is that I don&#039;t have access to a bank account so I have to use other means of payment. alexmack380 told me he would sell me some but after surfing the forums I&#039;m not so sure he is trustworthy. This is all the money I have atm and can&#039;t risk getting burned, have already been burned for $230 recently. Fucking bitinstant just had to shut down at the exact time I needed their service. Any help would be greatly appreciated. CyNiC

				Local bitcoins has good protection if you are meeting the person live. Coinbase is easy but is not anon and takes a week per purchase. Oh and beware, now that you have posted this you will probably get messages or responses saying that they can sell you BTC, I dont recommend doing that.

				what is wrong with the meet in person option on localbitcoins? you meet the person, let him scan your request qr code on your smartphone wallet,give him the money and that&#039;s it .10 to 30 minutes later the coins are in your wallet. hell, you don&#039;t even need to put them in your wallet, you could just give him the number of your silkroad wallet&nbsp; and watch him sending them there.

				coinbase you can actually do instant btc buys if you do 2 step verification process. i think the first is connect with a legit bank account of yours. second is identity verification which is easy as they just pull up info about you from legal records and ask you questions to confirm things only the real you should know.<br /><br />and then instant btc purchases online, it&#039;s pretty cool actually. coinbase has come a long way.

				Moneypaktrader.com is good one to use the commission rates are high but worth paying to keep yourself anonymous for the extra security.&nbsp; The site is pretty easy to navigate and all you have to do is buy a moneypak card from any store that has them put the info in and your wallet address and you&#039;ll see the funds in there within 24 hours it says on the site.&nbsp; Ive used the site twice so far and the longest its took to add my money to my address is around six hours or so.&nbsp; Goodluck!

				I too need help getting bitcoins.&nbsp; Localbitcoins isn&#039;t an option... closest one is 100 miles away.&nbsp; Has anyone tried CoinMama or BitStamp?&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer to do a MoneyGram transfer.&nbsp; With Bitinstatnt shutting down, this is making me a nervous wreck.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at the local trader&#039;s on here and I only need a small amount for my purchase so they aren&#039;t an option either.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated!
