				Hello all.<br /><br />I&#039;m a very discreet person. I&#039;ve always wanted to buy online instead of from the jokers around me and now I will.<br /><br />I&#039;m a web developer, professionally (guess they can start profiling me with that&nbsp; ::) ).<br />&nbsp;<br />Where do I start? I want to make some rather large purchases, nothing small other than my first time with a seller. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;d trust a new-guy off the bat, so I don&#039;t expect anyone else to.<br /><br />What does everyone prefer for shipping? Obviously I don&#039;t want things being shipped from across the US and even overseas to my house often.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey njeff, faço o mesmo que vc, soh nao concordo com o que vc disse sobre o correio. Vc sabia que o correio brasileiro tem máquinas de raios-x e spectometro de massa? Tudo bem que só devem ter uns dois funcionando, heheheh, mas ainda assim é bom saber que existe né?<br /><br />Tenho feito alguns pedidos, e ao contrário do que os gringos falam (cuidado, muitos vendedores ao ver que somos do Brasil nos enganam na caruda, com a desculpa que as coisas aqui nao funcionam) as encomendas tem chegado num tempo bom.<br /><br />Recebi de:<br />Belgica: 17 dias<br />Republica Checa: 19 dias<br />Netherlands: fui enganado pelo vendedor dutchstore<br /><br />Um abraço

				welcome to SR!<br /><br />domestic is obviously the safest way as you don&#039;t have customs to contend with. some people use drop houses, others use PO boxes, some use their own address - that is your call. a PO box on fake credentials would possibly be the safest bet, but you need to make sure there&#039;s no CCTV there.<br /><br />as you&#039;ve said, start small. once you&#039;ve found a vendor you are happy with (read, read and read some more on the forums), make a few smaller purchases, not just one or 2, but several - these will build your buyer stats up. if you only make a couple of small purchases then go for a big one the chances are the vendor will ask you to finalize early, as you&#039;ll still be seen as new and won&#039;t have decent stats to back your honesty up. finalizing early leaves you open to getting robbed - always stay in escrow, no matter how trustworthy the vendor seems. after a few small purchases PM the vendor about a bigger order (or 2, or 10) and go from there. make sure they are willing to let you keep in escrow, if not message another vendor.<br /><br />basically it&#039;s all about the stats, the better buyer stats you have, the more likely you are to be accepted on a big order in escrow<br /><br />i can&#039;t emphasize enough - READ as much as you can on the forums, about encryption, bitcoin, and especially feedback of the vendors you have your eyes on. you don&#039;t have to read from the start of the thread if it&#039;s like 50 pages long, but you should at least go back a couple of months worth of posts to see how they&#039;re currently doing, how they handle their customers etc.<br /><br />hope this answers some of your q&#039;s. <br /><br />have fun, and stay safe! :)<br /><br />Morty

				I don&#039;t order internationally, but I&#039;m sure if I was in a country with few vendors I probably would. It&#039;s safest to order domestic, personal amounts. I wouldn&#039;t mess with bulk orders, but that&#039;s just me. Do as thou wilt, but be careful!

				Welcome!<br />I&#039;ve only made 3 purchases on SR so far, and all of them have been 100% legit.<br />If you follow these steps your experience will probably be as positive as mine has been~<br /><br />1. Always use Tor (with a linux box helps keep out the Win-Holes (with a VPN for another layer of security if it feels too hot))<br />2. Learn to use PGP. Absolute must for ordering (you will see me next in the newbie PGP thread!)<br />3. Never FE. Never FE. and then again, just Never FE!!<br />4. Research your prospective vendors before using them, expect professionalism.<br />5. Ordering domestic is much safer even if it&#039;s not necessarily cheaper.<br />6. Keep all aspects of your SR account/pwd different from any other site, and make them complex.<br />7. Treat your vendor with respect and FOD &lt;-- Finalize on Delivery<br /><br />Cheers!
