				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the spur of the moment last night I decided to drop acid; I had just played soccer for two hours then smoked a joint and ate some quiche. A bit later I ate a hash candy. It was quite late but I was feeling wide awake and wanted to try out Tess’ product for myself. At 1:40am, I cut off a piece of a tab, about 1/3, and put it in my mouth (I estimate it was about 70ug). I let it sit there for maybe an hour before swallowing. While I’m dicking around on my computer waiting for it to kick in I put on No Gold// Hawaii by Chaperone; it seems like good music for tripping and I’m enjoying it. An hour has passed and I still don’t feel anything, so I start watching Firefly (first time through, I’m on episode 8). At around 3am I’m definitely feeling it and I’m really getting into the episode. After it ends I have the urge to go outside. I grab a folding chair, set it in the middle of my backyard and watch the stars for a while. I can pick out a satellite drifting through the sky and try to follow it but it isn’t very bright and I lose it. I’m completely mesmerized by the night sky for probably 20 minutes, but it’s chilly and I’m wearing shorts so I head back in. As I walk down the stairs to my room in the basement, I imagine that it is a cave; I’d rather not live in a cave, but at least it is my cave. I ponder how it is also like a cage because living in my parent’s basement won’t allow me to reach my full potential. I wonder if the similarity between the words ‘cage’ and ‘cave’ has any significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get into my room I put on the music again and look at the van Gogh painting, “Irises,” that is hanging on the wall in my room. The leaves of the flowers seem to be moving back and forth very fast, as if they are flickering. I wasn’t expecting any visuals from such a small dose, but they continue for a few more hours. I’m experiencing quite a bit of cotton-mouth which I assume is from the edible, not the acid. I turn my attention to my laptop, and stare into my background image for a while. It’s a bright blue circle painted on a black background and it is shape-shifting too. After a while I start to see a face in it and get a little freaked out. I decide to look at some more art and pull out a Matisse book. There are hundreds of paintings in there and most of them don’t do anything for me. I enjoy his abstract paper cut-outs so I skip ahead to that section. Some are really weird but I really like most of them, there is a certain feeling of movement in them that I love—and that the acid enhances. It is at this point that I feel really freaked out by the music that is playing because it seems so ominous (‘greeting ships by night’ by Chaperone). I go to Pandora and try to find something that fits my mood. I usually love electronic music but I just can’t handle anything with a beat right now, so I settle on Brian Eno and look at some more art. ‘Theme from Creation’ is playing and it seems fitting as I feel like I am becoming a new person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 5:30 am I notice some light outside my window so I go outside. The birds are chirping and I see a pair of mallards in my backyard. I walk around to see my sister’s rabbit in its cage and pet it, but she isn’t very interested in me, so I leave her alone. I grab my longboard and start cruising around my neighborhood. Even though my legs are still tired from playing soccer last night, it feels amazing to carve down the hill. I’m listening to Wolf Parade and everything is great. Pushing my board back up the hill, I am reminded how tired my legs are, but I do it four or five more times. <br />The sun is now up and I’m getting a bit sweaty from pushing my board around, so I head back inside. My parents will be up soon and I’d rather not interact with them so I retreat back down into my room. I lay down in my bed and read for a bit. The euphoric feeling that had enveloped my body for the past four hours is fading, but when I look up at the van Gogh poster the leaves are still flickering, 6 hours after I dosed. I try to sleep but I can’t, so I browse the internet for a while and look at some more art. Eventually around 9am I’m able to sleep but I only get a few hours as I have class at noon. I still feel a little strange but I’m able to concentrate and understand the lecture. <br />Overall I’d say it was a very successful trip and stronger than I expected. I didn’t have any real deep thoughts or see anything crazy, I just felt great and appreciated everything around me. <br />
