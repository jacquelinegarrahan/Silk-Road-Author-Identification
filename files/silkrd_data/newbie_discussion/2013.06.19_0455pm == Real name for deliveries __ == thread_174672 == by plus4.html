				As far as I can tell, most people here seem to recommend using your real name for deliveries. I just cannot see how that would be a good idea. If your package gets identified then it&#039;s got to be a million times more difficult to argue your way out of it then if it&#039;s sent to someone else at your address.<br />As soon as the package is delivered, it gets marked &quot;not known at this address, return to sender&quot; and you take it away with you to the post office, obviously with a few detours.<br /><br />Can anyone convince me otherwise ?

				It&#039;s much more likely not to be delivered/caught if a fake name is used, and it&#039;s an obvious thing for someone to try to do to make it look like they didn&#039;t order it, when if that were the case, their address wouldn&#039;t be on it. Use your real name and the package looks legitimate.

				Fake name/address can stick out to the sorter and deliverer though. If you&#039;re going to use a fake, typically I&#039;ve seen suggested that you send at least six letters/packages to yourself using the fake name first, to verify that it will actually get delivered and to get the sorter/deliverer used to seeing that name.

				I&#039;m not sure why a fake name would stand out to the mail or delivery person. Certainly where we are, people rent out rooms in their houses all the time and people come and go all the time. We also get loads of junk mail delivered to all sorts of names. I can only see a fake name standing out if you live in a small town somewhere where peoples names and addresses stay pretty contstant. In a big city this just doesn&#039;t happen. <br />It seems a bigger risk to me using your real name versus the tiny risk of delivery issues with a fake name.<br />Still to be convinced!

				Well people do it, as said usually the suggestion is mail at least 6 letters/packages to yourself to make sure they actually do get delivered and make sure the carrier&amp;sorter are used to seeing it. Obviously don&#039;t mail them all the same day. It&#039;s kind of &#039;warming up&#039; the name. Last thing you want is the fake name not getting delivered, it bounces back to probably a fake return address or address where the person has no idea what it is, then boom now you&#039;ve got a package out there potentially in the wrong hands, and while it doesn&#039;t have your name on it, it does have your address. Not good.<br /><br />But the fake name would be helpful in case a vendor happens to be saving customer data and possibly selling it to that whistleblower guy at some point later.

				Never, ever use a fake name for a delivery. It raises red flags, and your delivery will potentially be looked at. The idea is to blend in with the vast amount traffic. &quot;Bend, like a reed in the wind.&quot; <br /><br />Also read the wiki. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

				Depending on what country you are also from can change this <br />ie in the US mail gets delivered by Name + Address if either of these arnt right it wont go through <br />but in Aus the postman just goes by the address so name is irrelevant

				^^ This isnt true at all. USPS will deliver your package or mail to the address listed on package. Name doesnt matter. I get mail and pacakages from past tenants all the time..

				Fake name is more suspicious imho. Postal workers here in Canada are looking to make sure the name matches the address. My contract for my PO Box says I have to inform Canada Post if another person is going to start receiving mail at my box number.

				I also get mail from past tenants and have thought about having my SR mail sent with those names. But so far I&#039;ve done 9 transactions and just used my real name. I figured the stuff I was ordering had a fairly low chance of being found (LSD,DMT). So far so good

				Real name is the way to go. It&#039;s easily possible someone else ordered something via your name. No way to prove otherwise.
