				Out on bail now, won&#039;t discuss more lawyer said to keep my lips shut. Why the fuck is this not front page? 5 people over at reddit have reported the same, and thurgood has confirmed it!<br /><br />https://pay.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1k8ew6/i_got_a_letter_even_if_its_domestic_help/cbmitm6<br /><br />Use tor to open this link. Thurgood is now in stealth!<br /><br />Lawyer specifically told me not to contact thurgood because from everything he has collected the seller has turned informant.

				Regardless of whether he is telling the truth or not one point is valid; don&#039;t order unless you can withstand a CD.&nbsp; People come onto SR and say, &quot;others aren&#039;t getting caught so I won&#039;t get caught either&quot; which is cool unless you get caught.&nbsp; In the US we&#039;ve got some pretty harsh drug laws.&nbsp; Our attorney general is talking about not charging so many non-violent offenders with sentences that carry a minimum mandatory but we&#039;ll see what happens with that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what thurgood sold, where it came from or how it was packed so I have no comment on that but if you are a customer of his and are waiting on a pack then obviously error on the side of caution.<br /><br />best hopes for all of us.

(lol HIGHschool). so i dont think it is not at all impossible that he could be one of these and/or something similar might of happened.<br /><br />The guy making the allegation that he got arrested could be lying.<br /><br />SO many possible ideas<br /><br />every person on the SR forum could be Him just that he created another name. <br /><br />Sometimes i wonder if the people who buy bitcoins for cash&nbsp; are informant types.
