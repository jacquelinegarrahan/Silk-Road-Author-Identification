				thats saying you have recieved the order.&nbsp; Avoid doing this,&nbsp; and you will avoid being scammed.<br /><br />Find another vendor is they require it,&nbsp; until you get enough rep (sometimes vendors say they require FE because you have low rep.)

				Plenty of very reputable vendors do not require finalizing early, so if you find one who does, just keep moving. Some vendors will offer the option to finalize early for some incentive (e.g. free shipping, bonus product), and you can use your own best judgement with these. I personally don&#039;t see any reason to ever finalize early.

				Never FE you seriously wont get your drugs. Ive bought a few things off the silk road&nbsp; my second purchas being from a vendor named irishdan. He sent me a standard message saying that since i was a new user and that i had to FE and that he didn&#039;t foresee a problem as he has over 400 transaction. I FE&#039;d and said i was happy to do it for a good vendor. He never responded and i never got my drugs. NEVER FE its just bad practice and good vendors almost never ask.

				Well, I FE&#039;d on my first order and it came the same day -- it really depends on the vendor. However, if you&#039;re asked to FE on an order and you have a flawless/near flawless track record, I would keep on walking. Communicate with the vendor, I think you&#039;d be surprised to find out that they&#039;re not all out there to scam you for your money -- they want returning customers, and so if they scam you -- you won&#039;t return!

				Yeah often established vendors ask for FE when you have less than 5 transactions. But you can check their feedback to see if they deliver or not; I have FE&#039;d for Frank Matthews many times as he requires it and says if you don&#039;t like it don&#039;t buy and I know with him he won&#039;t let me down and I take that calculated risk knowingly. That said IF you do FE and you get scammed then SR support can not help you. Escrow is there for buyer protection - use it and make sure you fianlize promptly when you get your drugs so you don&#039;t get bad buyers stats in the vendor&#039;s forum. BTW to get around the less than 5 transactions thing you can buy 5 downloadable books for like 1 BTC each or less and you instantly have your 5 transactions. There&#039;s a lot of guides to successfully using SR on the main forum. Knowledge is power not to compromise your personal safety AND your hard earned money.

				Its generally not the best idea to FE. I am guilty of doing it a few times to qualify for free shipping from trusted vendors. If I do I always make sure to check out the forums first.

				I decided that, as a rule, I will not FE. I do it for FrankMatthews because he has a history here and is well thought of. Even then, there&#039;s no way to know if one day he&#039;ll just say &quot;fuck it&quot;, take everyone cash, and never be heard from again. But I take that risk because he is so highly regarded. I won&#039;t do it for some new vendor who decides that he&#039;s the shit and that his dope is gold so he can make demands like that. Fuck that, there&#039;s loads of other legit vendors who don&#039;t require FE, so stick with them. That&#039;s my two cents, anyway.
