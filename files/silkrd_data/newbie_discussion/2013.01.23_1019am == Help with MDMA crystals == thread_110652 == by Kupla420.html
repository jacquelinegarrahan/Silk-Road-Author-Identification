				I&#039;m looking to get a better understanding on what to do to get MDMA crystals to the distribution point. I&#039;ve dealt with plenty of ecstasy and Molly but never with an actual MDMA crystal before. I&#039;m trying to expand my knowledge on drug variations and I want to start buying some of them. I&#039;m sure to a lot of you I&#039;m going to sounds like a complete idiot but can someone please explain to me what you do with the MDMA crystal so that you can distribute it? Only serious responders please as I&#039;m looking to buy some soon and I have a lot of people who want some but it&#039;s not going to do me much good if it&#039;s just sitting in my room as a rock. I know you obviously have to break it down but how do you go about that and after breaking it down what is the next step until it&#039;s ready to be sold? I&#039;d appreciate any help on this. Since I&#039;m on this site on my computer a lot I figured it&#039;d probably be best to not search a bunch of drug things through my browser so hopefully some of you will be willing to lend a helping hand on this.

				Not to sound patronising but you&#039;re talking about selling drugs and you haven&#039;t considered scales?<br />If you haven&#039;t thought about buying scales... buy some scales ;)

				My friends always let me use their scales :) I&#039;ve just never handled this drug before so I don&#039;t know how to break it down or what the typical bag weight should be. So I&#039;m just trying to figure out how I got about breaking it down and all that. I don&#039;t want to just end up repeatedly smashing it against a wall to break it apart and calling it a day. haha. I don&#039;t expect anyone to type me out an essay. Just some quick steps and I&#039;ll figure out how to do it off of that.

				MD rocks aren&#039;t like the rocks you find in your garden, they crumble fairly easily.<br />You could literally just grab it and snap it into pieces with your hands. Failing that, put it into a plastic bag and hit it with a book or something :p

				Also about weights, you could do gram bags, half gram bags, 3.5&#039;s... whatever you want!<br />You dictate the price but if you wanna keep respect don&#039;t undercut people with weights...

				Thanks for all the help everyone. I didn&#039;t realize how simple it is to work with the crystals. And it honestly wouldn&#039;t be getting in over my head. Like I said I&#039;ve worked with a lot of ecstasy and Molly, just never MDMA crystals so I just needed to know how to break it up and how much to sell out at. The measurement I was wondering about just because some of my friends told me that you need to do less since this is the pure stuff. So I was wondering if that was true also so I know how to tell my friends how much to do. Keep in mind my friends and I typically snort Molly every time and I know for some people that hits them harder so I need to make sure I know the proper dose to tell them. I appreciate all the help. Thanks for all the help everyone. <br /><br />Also where can I get capsules off here cause I didn&#039;t see any...?

				Alright thanks. The pills seem like a huge hassle but yeah people do prefer them more... I&#039;m quite undecided on how I&#039;ll want to distribute these. Well I appreciate everyone&#039;s feedback. It definitely helped me get a better idea on it.

				Molly is basically the same as the rocks (at least where Im from), just crush, weigh, and put in either a bag or in pills.&nbsp; As stated earlier, pills require the most time but pay off the most on the retail end.&nbsp; I would advise against cutting said molly with anything,&nbsp; as that can lead to problems down the line, but that again depends on your market.<br />TinyDot

				Yeah I never cut or lace what I sell and everyone always respects me because in my area everyone rips the buyers off. I&#039;m basically the only person who deals the exact measurement if not a little extra. But now my question is, why is it that the pills would cost more than the bags? Whenever I would get Molly it was always 10 a pill and 10 for the same amount in a baggy. Are you all recommend I charge extra just for the fact that I&#039;m buying bills to put them in? Cause I&#039;ve never seen price differences before with equal measurements of pills and baggies. I always try to keep my rates solid and I always sell for less than everyone in my area cause they&#039;re prices are just insane. People out here sell 120 mg hits of X for 20 each when in other states around me I&#039;m hearing that they&#039;re paying 20 for the 200+ mg hits. So I tend to get extra business for giving people the moneys worth unlike everyone else over in my area.

				Yeah that makes sense. I think the one guy was selling it for 10 though cause I&#039;m basically 100% sure he was cutting it with adderal. It was bogus. Last time I did it I bought 3 and I literally had an extremely light roll for about 35 minutes and that was it. I was pissed as all hell.

				Yea cut pills suck, we used to get alot of molly back in the day which was awesome if you ate two gel caps of it, but also you wouldn&#039;t sleep for a day because of the speed cut added in to &quot;fill the pill.&quot;&nbsp; Funny thing is if you use smaller pills then people think they are getting less, when really they are just getting the same ore more molly and NO cut.<br /><br />TinyDot

				Yeah well you know Americans... We always gotta think bigger is better rather than paying attention to the actual quality and quantity... The world is just becoming ridiculous at this point especial in the US. I can&#039;t even believe the kids these days. I mean I&#039;m still pretty young myself, I&#039;m only going to be 20 in July but seeing how fast the kids are getting worse is just unbelievable. It&#039;s not even taking decades anymore, it&#039;s literally getting worse by the years. I mean I was a late starter when it came to drugs, I didn&#039;t even smoke weed til I was 18 but with my generation the youngest I&#039;ve heard of someone doing drugs was probably like 14. About 2 months ago I had some girl come up to me and she asked if I knew where to find acid and I responded saying maybe and asked how fast she could get to the spot. She comes back with Oh I can&#039;t drive yet I&#039;m only 12. I just laughed, shook my head and walked away. Can&#039;t even believe kids these days.

				No no I didn&#039;t mean it like she knew me. She had no idea who I was. I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like by you but out here, people will literally just walk up to anyone young person they think does drugs and they&#039;ll ask where to find them. I look like a hippie so she assumed I&#039;d be the best person to ask. But yeah she didn&#039;t know who I was. I&#039;m very discrete with my sales. If I don&#039;t know you, I&#039;m not admitting I have anything, especially the fact that I deal. Everyone out here really just doesn&#039;t give a shit and they&#039;ll ask anyone who looks like they use drugs. Especially at malls. If I&#039;m chilling outside the mall having a smoke really quick, it never fails that at least 2 people will ask me if I have any and then when I say no they ask if I know where to find some.

				On a quick side note, when you guys made your first order did all or any of you use the decoy packages first or did you guys just go straight into the drugs you wanted? I&#039;m debating on what to do with that... After Christmas I did order a shit load of stuff off amazon so packages coming was a pretty regular thing. One thing that is making me feel iffy though is the fact that one possibly 2 of my packages (the big yellow envelopes) looked like it had been opened and re-glued closed... I say this cause the white part of the package from the inside looked frayed like how it does after you rip the glue apart, but the frayed part was sticking out under the glue before I even opened it. So I don&#039;t know if that means they checked through one or two of my packages cause I had so many sent or what so I&#039;m just wondering what most people on here chose as their first move. Also pretty much all of my packages were just sitting and sorting facilities for quite a bit of time at some points. I made sure to check them every day and it would take them days to move, and those ones were just games, which would be pretty obvious couldn&#039;t be something bad...

				Mortar and Pestle are the way to go for crushing MDMA.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;re probably just extra nervous about the mail.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t done anything, why would they suspect you?

I also have one of these:<br />&lt;clearnet&gt;<br />http://www.amazon.com/Cap-M-Quik-Capsule-Filler-machine-size/dp/B003TI4AR4<br />&lt;/clearnet&gt;<br /><br />I actually use it for herbs, but if I had a lot to cap, it would work for that too. I just make sure the powder is uniform, and filling them up they are usually around 140-150mg. One could top off with that funnel idea too, that&#039;s a great one.
