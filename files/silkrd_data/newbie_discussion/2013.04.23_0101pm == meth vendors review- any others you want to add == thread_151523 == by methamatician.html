				OK all ,i have tried most of the meth vendors ( the ones that will ship to Australia) and my reviews are as follows-<br /><br />Time to update this thread.Since first posting have tried a few more vendors and have been forced to change a few reviews of prior vendors.<br /><br /><br />-Kush411-stealth 10/10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-communication:8.5--update15/5/13-has completely dropped the ball,very poor if any communication,i dont know what is up with him.Would recomend to stay away for a while.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-delivery time :10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance :10&nbsp; quality :9.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-batches all vary the worst batch i would say was still a 8.0<br /><br />-Hammer time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15/5/13--The hammer is back and so is his A game.Great value<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth :8.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-communication :9&nbsp; (although down to zero at the moment as he is away)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;delivery time : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance :9.6&nbsp; quality : 9.6<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-as all vendors do batches vary worst i have had is&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;-cant comment on various batches as i have only purchased of him once<br /><br />-Red Bull<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15/5/13--since posting another 3 of his batches all equally as good.Bit on the expensive side,but great to deal with.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -stealth :8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-communication :10<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-delivery time : 9.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance :9&nbsp; quality :9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-awaiting second order,cant comment on batch to batch consistency yet.<br /><br />-DubG <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth : 8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-communication : 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - delivery time : 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -product/appearance :9&nbsp; quality :8.8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -only the one batch so far,first one didnt make it.<br /><br />-SamGiancana<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth :6.8&nbsp; ( honestly dont know how it got through customs,no vac seal,not even ziplock bag.but clever packaging )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- communication : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-delivery time :9.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance :9.3&nbsp; quality&nbsp; 5.3&nbsp; ( after an acetone wash of 3g yielded only2 back,30%+ loss,product was then fire)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-didnt buy again<br /><br />Breeze The gnome<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 2 attempts neither made it,but 50% refund given<br /><br />-MIMM <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15/5/13--this guy just sux,but did get 50% refund.Stay away............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 1 order only as i am bit weary of him.Order in resolution with a 14 day extension given<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- will update with out come<br /><br />-The Company<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- stealth :7<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-communication : 6 ( rude arrogant pricks )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- delivery time : 6 ( said it was in transit for 7 days before i get msg saying hurry up and FE,i am waisting time)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance : :6.6&nbsp; quality : 8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-never bothered to order again<br /><br />-MjrPplayer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth : 8.8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -communication : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;delivery time : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance : 7 (didnt get famous blue tinge batch ,one just after,slightly dirty with brown contaminents ) quality :8.7<br />A little about me<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -member for 3 months<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --over $25,000 spent<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -49+ transactions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -1.02% refund rate<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -0% auto finalise<br />&nbsp;I dont claim to be an expert but i have done the yards to qualify to give an honest evaluation.Getting deliveries down under not an easy thing to do.So any vendor that does deserves sum respect.<br />You can almost guarantee kush 411 will get it ti you,and quickly,the guy is a freak.<br />Would ,and am going to stay away from- the company,mimm, dont know what i was thinking.I can see why kush is so expensive&nbsp; (even more to Oz) i just wish he would come back down in price.<br />People must take into account that i am only speaking from my personal transactions with these vendors and can only speak for myself.<br /><br />Update on new vendors( new to me )<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First Class Fix<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth : 8.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -communication : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance : 6&nbsp; Due to stealth reasons product came mostly as crushed powdery shards.Smoked up very well and couldnt taste any cut.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-quality : 8.5<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crystal Ship<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth : 8.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -communication : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-product/appearance : 7 Again due to stealth product came mostly crushed,however more glassy crystals than powder.Seemed to have a slight pink tinge in color <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -quality : 8.8<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast Forward<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-stealth : 9<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-cummunication : 8.5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;product/appearance : 8.8&nbsp; &nbsp; nice clear shards,no powder,burns very clean<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -quality : 9<br /><br />If you get the chance i would strongly recomend any of the latest trio i have reviewed along with Hammertime and Red Bull.<br /><br />Again this review is only based on my own personal experience with each of these vendors<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;am sorry but I have read one to many of these &quot;vendor review&quot; posts and can&#039;t contain my annoyance any longer. I mean who in there right fucking mind would ever do such a thing. Its jumping out of the sack currently occupied with one of the chicks from a list of the 10 hottest actresses under the age of 25 because some anonymous chick just replied to your craigslist ad.&nbsp; Seriously, when the known quality is damn near perfect as you claim, why would you risk the money and penalties to take a change on some unknown shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />If your going to post a product review post something useful like about its properties such as describing how it cracks are recrystallizes, how hot does it have to get before it starts to melt and give off smoke, whats the exhale like, instead of some amorphous and totally unexplained rating system.

				Thanks for those reviews Mathamatician!&nbsp; I am a newbie to the Road and started out with the safer but more expensive option - domestic vendors... Just to get a feel for things.&nbsp; But it&#039;s so expensive,and the gear is not always mind-blowing (wait I should correct that, it&#039;s not mind-blowing for me, but my tolerance is up there!)..<br /><br />So the time has now come to try out some of the big boys o/s.&nbsp; I really appreciate your reviews, because there are so many conflicting stories about the vendors and it&#039;s hard to know where to start... All I know is that I am ready to have a taste of those sexy shards from across the otherside of the world ;) <br /><br />But I am one of those typically indecisive girls who just can&#039;t make up her mind!!&nbsp; Especially when it comes to my friend, Crystal.&nbsp; My biggest concern is the stealth (sorry, let me correct that!)... The biggest concern for me is getting bunk gear instead of awesome gear~ :) :) :)&nbsp; second biggest concern is the stealth, especially when ordering from o/s.&nbsp; The Co has had some really bad feeback reviews from Oz, especially in regards to stealth and communication when things go wrong..&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wondering if anyone has ordered from AoD yet and feedback?&nbsp; And I would love to hear updated recommendations for o/s vendors please?&nbsp; Maybe PM me so we don&#039;t have every tweaker hitting up the same dude from across the ocean and ruining a beautiful thing for us all!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;) :)
