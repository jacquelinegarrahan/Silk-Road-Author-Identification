				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111042.0<br /><br />You know what the problem is? It is not that I disagree about censorship or the fact that I think this guy is a huge douchebag and always has and always will be. It&#039;s just that he gives away so much info about himself that I already know who he is. I&#039;m not talking about easily read info like my posts, I&#039;m talking about mannerisms, egotism, short temper, and of course the constant douchebaggery and other personality traits this guy gives off. everything about him (along with other information) gives away who his vendor name is(along with a lot of other info)<br /><br />So my point is... if you are starting an anon forum account for posting without giving away your normal or vendor account, don&#039;t make the same mistakes as this guy, obscure everything about yourself, become a completely different person. Now I know I am not doing the same... but the difference is I am NOT an SR vendor nor do I care about giving away my ID because it will be a long time before I can do business on SR again.<br /><br />with all that said.. I&#039;m going to grab another beer and think about how I can scare intelligence into SR vendors who require it, for everyone else, disregard this post, or jump in and call ME the douchebag :D it&#039;s all in good fun until identities are revealed

				His post made absolute no damn sense. It seemed like he was arguing against his title statement more than anything else, but the whole post lacked any coherent theme. Quit complaining about the censorship newbs! and then he turns around and complains about other censorship. Am I missing something?
