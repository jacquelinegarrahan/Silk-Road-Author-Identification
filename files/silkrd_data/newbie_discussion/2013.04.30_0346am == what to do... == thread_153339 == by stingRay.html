				Hi, this whole SR situation has me even more depressed than usual. I was expecting an order of bud or oxycodone to be shipped this week, but it appears that won&#039;t happen. I&#039;m not too concerned about the oxycodone because I rarely use it. However, the bud is the only thing that keeps me sane, happy, and from getting bored. <br /><br />I have a history of depression and it has been especially bad these past few months and weed has been quite helpful for that. Now that my plans to obtain some from SR fell through I will not have any because all the money I would use for drugs is locked up in SR. <br /><br />I honestly have no idea what I am going to do with my time and was looking for some advice. The thing is my depression is causing me to experience no joy or happiness, no matter what I try to do I just don&#039;t enjoy it at all. Even something like eating is a chore for me because whenever I try to eat food just seems repulsive. Also, my anxiety has been horrible ever since my doctor took me off of clonazeapam after being on it for about 10 years (I actually think its worse than before I even began taking them). This makes socializing incredibly difficult for me as well. <br /><br />I can&#039;t even just sleep through that time either because I have insomnia, which of course weed aids me in sleeping as well. So, I&#039;m going to be stuck not sleeping for a day or 2 at a time with nothing to do, but stare at a TV screen which will drive me nuts. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why, but bad shit like this seems to just follow me.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to catch a break. Anyway, I really have no one else to go to :-/&nbsp; <br />

				Sorry to hear this man. The good times in the future will be all the better because of the bad times you&#039;re going through right now. <br /><br />If I had some, i&#039;d send your way, but i never could get into weed.<br /><br />I&#039;m not quite sure why a doc wouldnt have you on some kind of SSRI though.
