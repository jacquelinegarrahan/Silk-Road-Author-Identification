				i have some pescription codeine, never tried to use for recreational use and I have read a few things about cold water extraction but am not too confident as a paracetamol OD is apparently fucking nasty! <br /><br />Anyone had much fun with codeine? The stuff I have is NHS standard, 30mg codeine phosphate hemihydrate / 500mg paracetamol. <br /><br />Let me know if any of you guys have managed to get anything fun out of these.. I so far am pretty disappointed!

				If you enjoy morphine and constipation then you will enjoy a large amount of codeine.<br /><br />Codeine turns into morphine in your liver.&nbsp; One fifth of the amount of codeine that you took.<br /><br />200mg of codeine will turn into 40mg morphine in your liver.

				Yeah, codeine doesn&#039;t do anything by itself to you, it requires your liver to metabolize it into morphine, kind of the same process that happens when you take andro or other prohormones that &quot;aren&#039;t steroids&quot; but once your liver metabolizes them- tada! they&#039;re the desired substance. At that point, it&#039;s just morphine.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had vicodin, which is semi-synthetic and much (12x?) stronger than an equivalent amount of codeine. The same precautions that apply to vicodin apply to a lot of codeine brands: they come with tylenol in them, so be mindful of just how much tylenol you are taking

				Very informative guys, I will do some more research on cold water extraction and erowid experience vaults. <br /><br />Looks like codeine isnt going to be the thing for me though. Thanks for your help!

				Also remember that due to the liver&#039;s mechanism of absorption, about 400 or 500 mg of codeine is the max you will be able to absorb, please check the exact number but it is around that.
