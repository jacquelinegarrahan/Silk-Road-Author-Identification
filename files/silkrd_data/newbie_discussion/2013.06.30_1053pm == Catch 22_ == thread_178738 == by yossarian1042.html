				From what I have been reading on the forum, I am beginning to see that if you are a noob with 0 stats, the vendors will not sell to you.&nbsp; And if the vendors won&#039;t do business with you, you will never get those stats above 0..CATCH 22....Seems the only exception is that some vendors might do business IF the noob FEs.&nbsp; BUT I have seen over and over the there are 2 main rules about FE&nbsp; 1....NEVER FE and 2. NEVER NEVER FE!&nbsp; So how is it possible to do some business on here?&nbsp; Anybody want to address this?&nbsp; Thanks!

				Check out the other sections for stuff to buy. You&#039;re be more likely to find smaller things that the vendors are willing to sell to new buyers. And if you buy digital goods you don&#039;t even need to wait for shipping to get your stats up. :)

				Mainly, people that sell in the larger amounts don&#039;t deal with new people.&nbsp; There are tons of reputable vendors who welcome newcomers happily.&nbsp; Depending on what you are looking for, you might have to make alot of small transactions before you do a big transaction with a vendor that wants more experienced people.&nbsp; Did anyone mention to you not to FE???? lol.

				As a new buyer just buy small listings, as a vendor I appreciate it when a new buyer messages me first especially for larger listings. Whatever you do don&#039;t FE since you lose all your protection if you do.

				This is a compelte fabrication. I have honestly ever read the words(or a similar phrase) &quot;No New Buyers&quot; Like twice on silk road in general.<br /><br />If you really want stats then buy digital goods like ebooks or pornsite rips if you&#039;re having THAT much trouble.<br /><br />I feel as though once vendor said this and then you made this thread because you really wanted what that vendor was selling.

				Just shop around, you will find one that does sell to noobs sooner or later. Might not be the best bargains on the road, but then I hear alot of them are too good to be true

				Yossarian1042, First off, I totally love the name reference and the fact that this post is named Catch 22! Read the book for college and love the movie too.<br /><br />Next, I&#039;m a vendor and have been reading posts of alot of vendors making people FE and even further making threats to their buyers when they don&#039;t do exactly what they want. It&#039;s rediculous and bad for the entire SR community. Anyways I am a vendor that will gladly serve you without these issues. Might not have the exact drug you&#039;re wanting but I am here to serve ya. I&#039;m sure there are other vendors like me who will be happy to get you what you need. It just seems like some of the vendors have lost touch. Good luck! ;)

				Have used mdpro several times without a hitch. Was my first buy with zero stats, i have even traded mp for btc with him through pm, and was put into my account within fifteen minutes after he was online and verified the numbers. Also, multiple transactions with him with fast delivery and excellent stats. Try pm&#039;ing him and use btc to buy from him as well if he has what you are looking for. Hope this helps

				Thanks to all that replied, especially The Fun Guy!&nbsp; I have been studying the forums quite diligently for some time now and see that I will be able to obtain what I am looking for when my SR wallet gets funded.&nbsp; And NO WAY will I EVER FE.&nbsp; It&#039;s foolish and reckless and makes no sense at all.&nbsp; Thanks again folks!
