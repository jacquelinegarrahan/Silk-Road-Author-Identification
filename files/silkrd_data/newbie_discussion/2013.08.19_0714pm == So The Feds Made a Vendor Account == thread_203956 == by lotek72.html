				I looked through every topic and it doesn&#039;t seem that anyone has seen this article. Apparently Law Enforcement made a vendor account and used that to make an arrest. It&#039;s driving me insane that no one is talking about this because this really is the biggest thing to ever happen on tor. I guess we just have to be wary of newer vendors. Let me know if this link is a repost, but i have looked through the forums and haven&#039;t even found a mention of it.<br /><br />(clearnet link)<br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2357954/First-Bitcoin-bust-Feds-seize-electronic-currency-connection-shadowy-internet-drug-bazaar-Silk-Road.html

				I&#039;m shocked at the Daily Mail. The amounts are in dollars and the widget at the bottom doesn&#039;t do Â£s!<br /><br />Edit: &quot;chomping at the bitcoin&quot; ! The Sun would be proud of that.

				As far as I&#039;m aware, the police making a vendor account and pretending to sell drugs would be illegal in the U.K at least.

				Yeah I&#039;m not sure I buy this. Daily Mail is garbage, and this seems illegal (Not that that means feds won&#039;t do it anyways

				I&#039;m with you on the daily mail, worst most biased newspaper out, literally an evil piece of work! <br />I call it the daily scare, much better off with the independant or I.<br />The problem is if the cops caught you by making a vendor account, they would actually have to send you drugs? no? Possession is the crime and if they just take your cash and you have no drugs? <br />It would be entrapment anyway IMO.

				Exactly.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a lawyer, but I don&#039;t think feds can do this. I&#039;d need to see a lot more proof than this shit.

				I don&#039;t know if they can legally do this in the US but it is a scary thought. I&#039;m right now very close t making a buy from a relatively new vendor. He&#039;s got some transactions, not brand new, but, he&#039;s not a 300+ vendor with a ton of forum feedback.&nbsp; It&#039;;s scary, but, I&#039;ve done it B4. I&#039;ll nPM back n forth a bit and get a good gut feeling boutr a new vendor and go for it. I wound up getting some killer assed C from the dude too.

				It wouldn&#039;t have to be a vendor.&nbsp; Anyone can send anyone money on the site.&nbsp; They could have accessed his account and sent the money to their account to cash it out.&nbsp; In theory anyway.&nbsp; Just saying it wouldn&#039;t need to be a vendor account even if things did go down the way this article says it did.

				There is many threads on this already.&nbsp; Just look around.&nbsp; Casey Jones was a vendor.&nbsp; The feds were not the vendor.<br /><br />Here is one of the many threads about this.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181225

				This is old news, he was most likely busted from running his mouth locally where he lived or had outside problems which led them to him and he had his passwords etc set out which enables the feds to be able to seize. This shouldnt be possible unless you keep a ledger of all your info which this guy clearly did. That or he told them all his info and were able to log in, which is possible as well.
