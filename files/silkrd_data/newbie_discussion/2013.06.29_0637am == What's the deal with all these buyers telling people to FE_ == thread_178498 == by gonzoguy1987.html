				I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t care how respectable you are as a vendor, we both gotta look out for our own interest and I believe that the escrow system is mutually beneficial.&nbsp; They can wait &#039;til I get my product; believe me if you do me right, I will not leave you hanging.&nbsp; And it is the loyal buyers telling people to FE in the feedback; alot of the best vendors specifically tell people not to FE.&nbsp; It makes me skeptical like the vendor pays people to leave feedback like that.&nbsp; It looks sketch.&nbsp; It is my money and I know I am new, but the faster your shipment gets to me, the faster I can FE and if you do me right I will talk you up in the forums.&nbsp; I am a very honest guy and have a deep respect for drugs and customer service; we can work together to help build each others stats.&nbsp;

				If you dont like a vendor&#039;s requirement then dont use them. There are many respected vendors that will not require you to FE.

About fake feedback, vendors don&#039;t need to pay people to do that. There&#039;s at least one way they can do it themselves. Something about stealth listings. Maybe they make a separate account and &quot;buy&quot; several free stealth listings from the original vendor account. That&#039;d work so I&#039;m sure its been done.

				for my first few purchases, 2 of the 3 vendors asked me to FE. i was skeptical but read all the feedback and decided to do it. there are a lot of attempted scams, where the receiving party claims they did not get the package, etc.&nbsp; 1 was my very fist purchase, <br /><br />so if you&#039;re new and have little transaction history, vendors will ask for their money up front . like a deal in person. you don&#039;t get the benefit of the doubt until you prove yourself, you don&#039;t get spotted on the first exchange. <br /><br />so my advice is to start small, so if you FE and you get burned, it&#039;s not that bad. you show you can be trusted, and establish communication with some vendors, and get comfortable in general with the road.

				Good advice, I&#039;ll stick with never FE and deal with the cool vendors and build of my buying stats the old fashioned way.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to get burned even for just a $20; I&#039;m not well off so any amount of money is alot for me to lose.&nbsp; And besides, it is just the principle of the matter too.&nbsp; I know there are scammers on both sides and I despise buyer scammers just as much as the seller scamming, but SR policy is there to protect us all.&nbsp;

				One of the things I have noticed is all the advice to NEVER FE, DON&#039;T FE, etc. etc.&nbsp; Then you look at the feedback of vendors and see shit like &quot;FE for this trusted vendor&quot;, &quot;FE cuz you&#039;re awesome&quot;, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m like WTF, are these shill reviews or something?&nbsp; How can everyone basically be saying Never FE, then reviews say &quot;FE for this vendor&quot;???????

				I read their profile first. If it says to message them first I do. The majority are pretty cool and simply ask you keep your orders small at first and you won&#039;t have to FE. I only buy weed but if you keep it to 1/8 or a 1/4 and establish some history with them you should be fine. If some newb rolls in and orders a QP it would be FE or no go for me if I was a vendor. Too risky of a financial loss and too risky that you are LE. I haven&#039;t had any problems yet as I keep it to personal use amounts only. Win for everyone. In the future I might order up to an ounce or two butr it won&#039;t be until I have established with a couple of good vendors that know I will finalize it quickly when I get it and am not an idiot that is going to get caught or attempt to scam them. I&#039;ll FE my first order from a vendor if they ask to establish trust, but generally I haven&#039;t been asked because I keep my orders small. And I only order from vendors that are highly rated in the forums. <br /><br />I am no expert about the resolution center, but I agree that there is not really a good reason to ask for FE from a new person, unless maybe it&#039;s a large amount or product or something. If they ship it and track it then it seems that if the package shows delivered they would win any resolution and keep the coin. Maybe they just don&#039;t want their cash tied up for 3 weeks dealing with scammers.

They can also save face if you submit a claim - and say they shipped your product when they never did and then refund you a portion or no money at all and having the refund on your hands makes you look like the scammer. All I can say is never finalize early. Never ever. Even if you have to pay a bit more to not finalize early - just DO NOT FE and PAY UP!!!

				can anybody decifer this response from a 22million a year Empire sent&nbsp; to me &#039;Vendor Support&#039; says &#039;funds on your account are accessible and when the current orders are completed, those funds will also be accessible. You have another account - &#039;MrNiceGuy007&#039; - stop messaging us about &#039;TheDankESTera&#039;................ ...MY response still is how the CUSS&nbsp; can I access funds when I need password reset AGAIN I&#039;ve been locked out going on 16 hours for going against policy. so what am I not understanding. u are mentioning things that are impossible on my end . prior to this i had ask to reset&nbsp; or unlock my account. ..Sr locked more than it<br />&nbsp;costs to become a vendor. DPR I got no strife with u. but your staff is abusing there position and Power. FYI&nbsp;

				I&#039;m from Aus and the only things I have to FE for are heroin and coke. Everything else no FE needed. I would never FE for meth, just &#039;cause the vendors are all so dodgy.<br />All the talk about our customs being good is nonsense. I got a dodgy letter with crystal meth sloshing around inside through customs easily, a couple months ago.

				Just be happy that there is an escrow system.&nbsp; I spent 15 years in the online drug market scenes and there was never an escrow system.&nbsp; It was all trust.&nbsp; Scams were pretty rare too.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty sad that all of the scammers come to Silk Road to play and that we need an escrow system but that&#039;s what happens and that&#039;s how it is.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t use tracking then us the vendors have to front our drugs in hope of receiving payment for them.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shittier situation for us than it is for you.&nbsp; That said, I don&#039;t require FE.
