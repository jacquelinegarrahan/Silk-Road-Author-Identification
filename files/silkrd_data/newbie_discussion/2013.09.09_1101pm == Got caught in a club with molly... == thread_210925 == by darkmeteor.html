				So what is the proper way of handling this situation? I&#039;m forewarning you guys - I know what my friend did was stupid, but beyond all can&#039;t blame anyone but myself. <br /><br />I was going to a concert with a group of friends, had a few pills in a baggie with me. went to the bathroom with my friends, one of them is being obnoxious about it and pretty much yelling for me to hand it over, as I did my bag dropped to the floor. As I was picking it up one of the bouncers walked in and right as I was putting it in my pocket he&#039;s like &quot;What&#039;s that&quot;&nbsp; Im like nothing and try walking away but he grabs my arms and forces me to empty my pockets. I&#039;m still hiding it in my hands at this point, but he makes me open my hands and grabs my arm and starts taking me out. There are cops outside, at this point I&#039;m tossing the&nbsp; molly on the ground and getting rid of everything I can, but in my frantic and panic and I can&#039;t get rid of one of the pills. He makes me throw away the last pill and tells me to get the fuck out and not come back otherwise he&#039;d tell the cops. <br /><br />Other than being blatantly stupid - what should I have done if he actually took me to the cops? <br />What could I have said before?<br />If I got rid of all my pills, he wouldn&#039;t have anything on me - could I have then tried to get back in saying he&#039;s bullshitting?<br /><br />Thanks for the input.

				DOnt listed to the retarded advice of the second poster, thats asking to get done for threats to kill alongside possession and possibly intent to supply. <br /><br />Heres the facts, if theres no evidence theres nothing they can do, pills are water soluable. the best advice is in the toilet, even if you have to struggle with them to get it there. as soon as they&#039;re in your out of trouble, there aint no bouncer gonna be putting their hands in a concert toilet for a few pills.. <br /><br />Secondly chose your friends more wisely, thats a serious one, your mate nearly got you arrested, he sounds like a 12 year old, and anyone who thinks my liberty is a pisstake aint a friend of mine. <br /><br />thirdly disguise your drugs. theres loadsa stash lighters, stash cigarette cases, stash you name it, drugs always in there, untill your in a cubicle on your own and gonna use em.. <br /><br />Despite what you think, you did actually dodge a bullet there if your in the UK, the pigs are trying to look like theyre coming down heavy on festival and club drug use. If you had gotten taken to the police, you WOULD have got charged and the likleyhood is you would have been in the cells till you got a visit to the Magistrates court on monday. That means your famalam would have found out, and you would have been in some shit. Despite probably only getting a fine or some community service as a sentence. remember pills are classed up there with crack and smack so you probably wanna start being more sensible and stop hanging out with retards... Personally first thing I woulda done when i was out of earshot of the bacon was brake &quot;my friends&quot; jaw. Losing your freedom over someones big mouth aint as funny as he would have ya think

				Never, bring the bag in with you... NEVER!! don&#039;t bring any more than you can eat. And if you have drugs, the last thing you want to do is attract attention.

				Just be glad that it went this way. You know you&#039;re not allowed to bring molly into a club, in my opinion you should accept the consequences when this kind of stuff happens. It`s the risk that you take when doing drugs in public places. Also your idea of trying to get back in sound bad to be honest. Bouncers aren&#039;t that stupid.<br /><br />I hope you have better luck next time.

				Thanks for the replies guys. Rookie mistake I know, but definitely an eye opening experience and learned lots of valuable lessons. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to start disguising my stuff - are there places that sell stuff specifically for disguise? Such as those lighters that can hold pills? That would be ideal.

				Personally I prefer to go out alone to the clubs especially when I will have drugs on me.&nbsp; I only do weed or shrooms while at a club and would only do these at places where its alright to do these drugs.&nbsp; That way you can do it out in the open and the bouncer won&#039;t care and might do it with you.&nbsp; This way you are more relaxed and the bouncers are more relaxing and the evening is much more enjoyable.&nbsp; I would never do molly while out, I think it would get me to ramped up and I would look to high and thus become a target for the cops.&nbsp; In my town (Globalist occupied USA) the cops just circle around the block like a herd of creepy peeping toms all night.&nbsp; Its kind of ruins it.&nbsp; But if you must, consider this.&nbsp; Why take the molly inside the club.&nbsp; Do it in the car before you arrive, or at home right before you leave is a good time, or at a gas station bathroom on the way there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just think you needed a little more planning that particular night.&nbsp;

				I think you only take what you need and I always put my goodies in tic tac or mint candy that fit good in my pocket. I drop before I go in and only take what I need. The bathroom is not the place to get that out. There is always some ass that works there at them.&nbsp; I have more luck when in line for the bathroom as most of the time no one is looking at you then. But the few friends I have heard talk about getting caught the bouncer just took there shit and threw them out. You did ok just got to have a little better plan of what to put them in.

				That&#039;s a tough one - chances are he would only drrag you to the cops if you pissed him off, because it turns into a lot of work for him, your best bet is to play sorry with him and say stuff liek &quot;let me throw this away in front of you&quot;, and &quot;sorry man, I don&#039;t want to make any trouble for you&quot;. You might try &quot;these are sopposed to be legal, thats what I was told&quot; - the idea being, make it clear you are being cooperatiove with the bouncer, and that it may be more trouble than he needs to take it to the cops.<br /><br />If you get dragged to the cops, you are best off saying nothing, just yes sir, no sir, give id, maybe say &quot;my dad told me if I ever got in trouble not to talk sir, he will be really mad if I do, so officer, please, I can&#039;t answer your questions, I&#039;m sorry to be so much trouble.&quot;. Keep repeating. Be completely passive and unresisting, keep saying &quot;My dad said sir, I&#039;m sorry&quot;.
