				Only 38 posts left. Hmm, wtf to talk about now.<br /><br />Let&#039;s see, drugs? What&#039;s silkroad been supplying me with lately.<br /><br />Got 50G of GHB. I enjoy the stuff with my GF, gets us nice and randy, I think I could bugger her with it if I play my cards right.<br /><br />Got a gram of DMT as well. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, I&#039;m a bit nervous about blowing my brains out still, I&#039;m going to work my way into it.<br /><br />I had 5 grams of EazyJet&#039;s MDMA, rolled about a month ago on it and it was amazing. GF has a new friend that is really cute and is up for a roll, I think I might have my first MDMA threesome scheduled! I&#039;m pretty sure I can die during that and be happy with my life.<br /><br />Waiting on some new 2CB to arrive too. Sexytime on 2CB is most lovely.

				OMG the only way I will get to 50 posts is make this my blog.<br /><br />Let&#039;s see. Last night my GF gave me a blowjob. As she is blowing me she keeps looking up at me. I&#039;m like &quot;bitch you want me to nut in your mouth, don&#039;t you&quot;. She says &quot;uh huh&quot;.<br /><br />I fucking love that about here, she absolutely loves my cum. Not like those girls that fake like they like it, she LOVES it.<br /><br />So I just say &quot;what the fuck not, it&#039;s valentines day&quot;. So I unload a big orgasm straight into the back of her throat, and she drinks almost all of it down like a trooper. <br /><br />Wow, that was all really crass? Being completely, absolutely anonymous on the internet sure does bring out the worst in us at times, eh?<br /><br />
