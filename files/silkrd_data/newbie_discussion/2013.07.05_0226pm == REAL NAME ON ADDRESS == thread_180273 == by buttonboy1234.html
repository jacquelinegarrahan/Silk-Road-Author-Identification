				Do you guys always put your real name on your address for SR items?<br /><br />I mean, if you put down a fake name (and for some reason you were caught) would it be safer because you can say it wasn&#039;t addressed to you? And that it ended up at your place by complete accident? Or is that just semantics?<br /><br />I realize it sounds paranoid but I&#039;m just curious more than anything.<br />

				I&#039;m fairly new as well, but I&#039;m using my real address because I heard using a fake name/fake address can red flag the postal worker. <br /><br />For instance, if the post man delivered to an abandoned house, wouldn&#039;t that be more suspicious than shipping to your original address? Also, apparently the government uses post office scans (not inside, but they scan the names/addresses outside), so imagine if they saw a new name addressed to your address. That might tip someone, or the super computer, off.<br /><br />As long as you encrypted your address securely (as that is highly sensitive information) to your vendor&#039;s public key, then you should be fine. I&#039;ve also read vendors will not completely refund you if you provided a fake name/address. So it&#039;s better to address to yourself, and if the package gets intercepted, well that is what the escrow is for (never finalize early of course)<br /><br />I&#039;m also super paranoid, paranoid to the point where I watch my text messages and emails for inappropriate words that might flag a system (cause you never know). I also call my dealers, though I&#039;m hoping to stop that now since SR has much better prices.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents, I&#039;d like the opinion of someone more experienced as well. I&#039;d like to think LEO is only concerned about big time vendors as opposed to small time users.

				Everything is monitored. Just watch the news. I used to do the same work as Snowden and I can tell you first hand, YOU ARE BEING WATCHED. Everyone, everywhere. Not specifically, but for patterns. Metadata is being scanned and mined for information. If something stands out, it&#039;s looked into further. A false name is a red flag. No return address is a red flag. Too much tape is a red flag. Personally, the only time I receive mail in my box with a name other than mine is when the previous tenant is still getting some mail here. You could try that, but most people put in a change of address form, and the post office usually won&#039;t put randomly named mail into your box, even if the address matches. There is a good read on the forum about security and postal procedures. Check it out. Put your real name, don&#039;t sign for anything. Don&#039;t sign for anything. Don&#039;t sign for anything. Did I say that already? Don&#039;t sign for anything. That&#039;s how they get your acceptance of the package. You can&#039;t deny it if you signed for it.<br /><br />Edit: all of the stickies in the section on shipping are good reads.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=6.0

				A false name is not a red flag. It depends entirely where you live. In the US that may be so, but in most other places, postal workers just deliver all mail to an address. They don&#039;t care about what name it has on it. With the amount of junk mail there is, there is no way they could look at for names and then spend time considering whether that person still lived at that address, especially in shared rented houses.

And it doesn&#039;t matter where they are located. If you&#039;ve gotten this far, getting tor and tails set up, acquired bitcoins, transfered and washed them, then don&#039;t be lazy and screw it all up with a half-assed encryption of your communications!!!!<br /><br />just my 2btc

				Here&#039;s my 2btc, use your real name. If you&#039;ve been living at your current residence for any period of time chances are that your mailman knows your name...it&#039;s going to look really weird to him when mail for some random dude shows up for your house; the mailman may go as far as writing wrong address on the package and sending it back to sender. Now, with that said, I was ordering large amounts of pills directly from India--not through the silkroad. I was very worried about the whole plausible deniability thing and I actually added a fake name to the little card inside my mailbox (I have a card inside my mailbox that has all residents last names, surely I&#039;m not the only one) and the mailman properly delivered the mail every time. I am not suggesting you do what I did, because in retrospect it may have looked shady (but who knows, a new roomate could&#039;ve moved in). I would just use your name, your address, dont ever sign for something, and if worst comes to worst deny the fuck out of ordering that package.<br /><br />good luck.<br /><br />KBM

				Actually bump for this thread...<br /><br />I&#039;m a little worried but not too much.. I live with sibling at the moment in South east Asia and I&#039;m half white...<br /><br />Its a rented place and my sibling has an asian name (not chinese), but I&#039;ve been silly as to use a pseudonym that isn&#039;t common in<br />this country at all, it has my middle name but other than that its fake.. I just wanted to ensure plausible deniability.<br />Anyways so far I&#039;ve made 3 orders at once and all came the next week, no issues whatsoever, and made sure I got to the mail before my sibling did,<br />since her work requires her to leave early in the morning and mine&#039;s in the afternoon.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve ordered again recently and it should be coming Monday, if not the weekends (but I don&#039;t think the mailman posts on the weekends here... do they post on the weekends for you guys wherever you are at?).. But I&#039;ve again used the same pseudonym (fake name).<br /><br />I live in a kind of apartment like area, there are several blocks and these apartments are only 4 floors and are small, its a guarded area. The guard knows I&#039;m a mixed race and mail doesn&#039;t go to any mail room but just straight to the mailbox downstairs. Anyways, do you guys think i&#039;m safe? I was considering to start to use the old tenants name or my other siblings name since she gets mail to this house... but i doubt either of them ever got international mail ever since they moved here, so using their name might rise suspicion if they start getting international mail to their name and not to my fake one...<br /><br />Should I just carry on using my current fake name? I feel like its already been used 4 times, I might as well carry on for the time I am staying here.. Any advice?

				This is a question that comes up again and again, there is even an answer in the SR Wiki. Anybody bother to look there?<br />Never mind, you should use your real name even though the postal&nbsp; service are more interested in the address. At Christmas I always get a few cards with the wrong name and sometimes the wrong (but nearest looking) address.<br />As to plausible denial ability, remember this:<br />Anybody can send anything to anybody providing there is nothing inside the letter/package that has a name on it, (e.g. a packing slip). It is called unsolicited mail, and there is nothing that LE can do, unless you open it.

				I&#039;ve always used my real name on orders. No reason not to. Like mentioned before, if you&#039;re not moving thousands of pills or bricks of pot then it is nothing. I know someone who works in the post office and they find shit all the time from when a package gets caught in a machine belt or whatever and exposed. Most workers would probably rather pocket your shit than go rat out. Even if they didn&#039;t, the only thing you get is a knock on the door and a little questioning. Just say you have a lot of enemies on the internet or something that have a vendetta against you or anything. If you see something suspicious before picking up a package just do not open it. The package is not your until you open it. Even write RETURN TO SENDER on it and wait before opening it if you&#039;re that paranoid.<br /><br />The end user isn&#039;t the big fish and using a fake name only gets that package a possible second look to confirm any errors on address. Why risk it?<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

So lets just say something is ordered from SR and the DEA/FBI try to perform a CD on the customer, will the customer&#039;s usual postman knock on their door and ask for the customer&#039;s signature or will it be a LE officer in a USPS uniform? Also when they knock on the customer&#039;s door and the customer looks outside and sees the postman with the signature confirmation materials in hand and the customer concludes that a CD is being attempted, what should the customer do? Not open the door? Or open the door and simply state, &quot;I&#039;m not signing that&quot;? Or if it isn&#039;t their usual postman can they say something like, &quot;Fuck off officer, I&#039;m not signing that&quot;? Is it better that the customer indirectly lets them know that they know what LE is attempting to do? Or does it not really matter whether they know that the recipient knows what&#039;s occurring because LE is probably on their shit like flies either way? Also thanks for the great advice and sharing your knowledge!
