				Hi to all my awesome customers and thank your for inspiring me to keep doing what I am doing.<br /><br />My main feedback thread can be found here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=189662.0&nbsp; but I want to open one on the newbie board as well so that if you have a problem with any order you are not forced to make 50 posts just to tell everyone I suck. xD<br />I believe in my service so I have nothing to hide and can take any constructive criticism&nbsp; :) <br /><br />This&nbsp; thread I link to my vendor profile where you can leave feedback, resolutions to delivery&#039;s that hopefully never fail<br /><br />Everything is up for discussion as I want potential buyers to see this is how I handle things, As an academic so firmly believe in peer review xD&nbsp; but please do not discuss my packaging in detail just say it was bad good or very good ect.<br /><br />Peace and Love<br />AnanasExpress

				So i had a few spare coins lying around and noticed this guys lottery...and its exactly as it claims spend X amount and take a chance at doubling up or losing it all and then BOOM transaction ended in a 8 and later that afternoon he messaged me told me had won then 10 mintues later my winnings were in my account!&nbsp; :) From a first time lottery player and winner... this could become addictive!!! Smooth transaction will be back when ive got that lucky feeling <br /><br />Cheers AE

				Bumping :) Can&#039;t wait for my pipe to arrive! It will definitely help me save my weed instead of rolling joints all the time, Using my homemade bong feels dirty, probably because I&#039;ve smoked DMT on it...<br /><br />Good day all :)
