				Hi, congratulations on your first order! It&#039;s good to see you went with a respected &amp; established vendor for your 1st time. FM gets many many orders, and yes can be some delays in processing, but he almost certainly will deliver for you a more than satisfactory 1st transaction. Welcome to the Road, good luck and stay safe :) AB.

				Don&#039;t FE dude on your first order, seriously I&#039;d avoid any kind of FE on here, doing so will lead to problems in the long run, the advise to use the escrow is there for a good reason! <br /><br />People tend to FE for sellers they have used many times and have a working, trusted relationship with, not fir sellers they have never used before, despite what ever feedback / fanbase they have.<br /><br />Stay safe!

				Sinister breaks is absolutely correct in warning you against fe&#039;ing. It&#039;s the easiest way to get scammed. However, FM is a very trusted vendor and has a consistently good track record. While, of course, sometimes an order doesn&#039;t show, there&#039;s never been any indication that he&#039;s a selective scammer or doing anything dodgy. His track record speaks for itself. He, as an established vendor has the right to ask for fe, especially from a newbie.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;FE is not the worst thing in the world, it can be an opportunity as a newbie to purchase from good vendors who may otherwise refuse to deal with you. It&#039;s up to you in the end. If you&#039;d like to fe, once the order has been marked as in transit you click the finalise button next to your order, AB.

				Vendors should not ask you to FE early, if they are then mention that to them lol. To FE early just goto the order and click finalize, as soon as you do the money is sent to the vendor, and should the package not arrive or you run into problems, your screwed, once you hit that, there is no comeback.<br /><br />I personally think people should make there own decision about vendors on here, for example a well known vendor (BudWorxUK) who also asked me to FE, never sent my package, in the end I had to goto SR or a resolution, which I got, however had I clicked on FE for this well known and trusted vendor, it might of been a very different story!

				Ah thanks both<br /><br />So marked in transit does not necessarily mean its in transit if i don&#039;t finalize early with Frank, is that the idea?

				Good luck! First time is always nerve racking :) SR and this forum are a testament to the reliability of mailed substances getting through, especially with a good vendor who cares about stealth, but do take this time to review your security. Many users advocate keeping a clean house while waiting for an order, meaning no drugs or paraphernalia around the house. Just a suggestion :) If you wanted to update this thread with how you went I&#039;d keep an eye out, am always interested in the experiences of newcomers, AB.

				NEVER FE! to anyone, it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a vendor with 100% feedback, your just asking to get scammed! FM is also a selective scammer, who sells bunk mdma as tests by silkroader&#039;s have shown, bad choice for your first purchase sorry....

				Not to scare you, but there&#039;s recently been coming some bad reviews on FM. Not replying to messages, taking weeks to get orders out, selling bunk or bad stuff.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40692.1095;topicseen Don&#039;t take my word for it. <br /><br />I would never ever FE. Find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require you to FE.

				just waiting on my 1st order now. the seller mrC didn&#039;t ask me to FE and he pm&#039;d me yesterday afternoon to say it should be with me in the next few days. waited for the postie this morning and when he came there was nothing. bit of a fucker having to wait another 24 hrs, but its better than waiting on the street for a guy who&#039;s saying he&#039;ll be 2 minutes then turns up hour and half later. i can just forget it for today and get on with other shit. still, would have been nice to got it today. i&#039;ll do a review thread if it comes thru ok.
