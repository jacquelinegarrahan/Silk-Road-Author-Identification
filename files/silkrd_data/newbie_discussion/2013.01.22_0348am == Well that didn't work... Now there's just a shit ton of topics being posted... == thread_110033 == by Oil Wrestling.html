				First of all I&#039;d like to notice that this solution is so stupid because here we have vendors here we have people ripped by scammers and they want to write their opinions in another categories but it&#039;s not possible for them till they will write 50 posts. <br />So they have to write stupid posts only to add to counter.<br />I&#039;d write more about it but I have to add posts to my counter xD
