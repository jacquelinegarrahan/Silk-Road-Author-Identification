				I was just wondering how many grams of MDMA is good to order at once without customs investigating if they find the package, I recently ordered a 50 gram package and am waiting for it to come through..

				Is this one of your first purchases? If you&#039;re relatively new, i&#039;d say order small amounts from different vendors. Check the quality, trust in a vendor, analyze their customer satisfaction. Once you&#039;re happy with a particular vendor, done a few smooth transactions with them and they list larger bulk orders, then by all means go ahead. I personally wouldn&#039;t order anything over 10g, but that&#039;s personal preference I guess!<br /><br />My advice for larger orders -- know your vendor, know your product (as you always should) and USE ESCROW.

				Yes it is one of my first orders but I have a friend who has ordered from the vendor before,, they have also had a 20 gram package taken by customs and only received a customs letter so was just looking into a safe relatively large amount to order and only receive a letter,, obviously customs don&#039;t have the man power to look into every package they take and 50 grams really isn&#039;t much.??

				Personally I would build up a smaller reputation before diving straight in on a large order... Vendors can be wary of newbies &amp; large bulk orders.<br /><br />To me, 50g being caught at customs addressed to me = trouble. 50g seems like a significant quantity to me! I&#039;d say 20g is probably the ABSOLUTE max I would want intercepted by customs. It&#039;s all down to your own opinion... it&#039;s you&#039;re choice and at the end of the day it&#039;s all illegal anyway... I just don&#039;t think customs would care so much over 1g - 10g compared to 20gs+.<br /><br />Perhaps get a drop point, a disused house with a mailbox outside. I wouldn&#039;t have large quantities ordered in my real name &amp; place of residence.

				Well any order over a few grams is going to make you look like a dealer. There is really no &quot;safe&quot; amount of MDMA to order.&nbsp; If caught it&#039;s a very illegal substance.&nbsp; The question is if it is for personal use or distribution. Dealers are more likely to be tracked down. But with a good vendor the stealth should prevent interception.

				Know your amounts as to what is classified as &quot;personal use&quot; or &quot;commercial use&quot; per the country / state you live in.<br />My guess is 50g is a stupid amount to order for personal use and is going to get you locked up. Start out small,<br /><br />&quot;from little things big things grow&quot;<br />

				As stated above find the laws for your area. I was readng up on one place where 10-199 grams is the same mandatory minimum, then 200-399.

				The feds hate MDMA.. Apparently 1 gram is equal to 500 grams of marijuana when talking legal issues. I personally wouldn&#039;t want to be caught period, but you could more than likely get off with a simple possession charge with 10 grams or less vs a distribution charge with more than 10 grams. So personally, I wouldn&#039;t order more than 10. Every state is different is different though, educate yourself with the internet! lol Everything you would ever want to know about anything is on here! Just be sure to check your sources and no matter what never take the word of someone off a forum (such as this one) without a grain of salt..<br /><br />STfish

				There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to how customs will handle a seized package. You have to realize customs deals with MASSIVE amounts of incoming packages. They are looking for needles in a giant haystack. It would probably take a very sizable amount, of a strong scheduled contraband, for them to attempt a controlled delivery. Doing a controlled delivery costs the government a lot of time and resources &quot;AKA Money&quot;. Customs seizes hundreds of packages a day. They have to pick and choose their battles. This is absolutely just my opinion, so take it for what it is, but I would say it would probably take around a kg of product to get them to try a controlled delivery. This is with customs mind you. If your local postal service were to intercept a package somehow, the amount would required would be dramatically less.

				Damn 50 grams, that is intense, yeah customs may not have a problem, but shuffling it to local LE could be an actual possibility, I agree with the others, keep it under 10 just to be safe, good luck my friend, you are braver than I.

				A &quot;safe&quot; amount to order is the same as the &quot;safe&quot; amount you can drive around in your car with. IRL 0g but generally as much as you can convince a judge or a copper is personal use. 50g is silly IMO.

				My buddy orders 25g from vendors in Germany all the time. He&#039;s probably up to 20 or so shipments and not a single one lost. He&#039;s definitely made $$$ on their sale but I&#039;m not sure I would take the risk myself. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a slight chance it would get intercepted at customs but once through there&#039;s virtually no chance domestic mail sorters will flag it for further inspection. Once it&#039;s been stamped through customs the scrutiny is over at those amounts. <br /><br />-CC

				I&#039;ve been looking at the site, and considering buying some MDMA myself. If it&#039;s domestic to domestic... like one state over... should I even be worried about getting it sent to my house?

				I&#039;ve ordered stateside and intl and basically it comes down to whether your vendor is careful or not.<br /><br />MDMA is quite stinky if you really take time to sniff it, and imagine trained animals if you can smell something. It must be packed so that no residue is left outside the sealed bag and measures taken to obfuscate contents from x-rays.<br /><br />As a rule, I never order from vendors who don&#039;t give GPG keys -- or worse no GPG key and they suggest you use some website that logs your IP to paste your address... thats even worse than entering your addy plaintext into the SR form imo. This has served me well in avoiding negligent vendors thus far. <br /><br />When giving feedback, make sure to VAGUELY note the discreetness and security of how it was packed. Example &quot;very discreet, vacuumed, no telltales A+&quot; bad example... &quot;Shipped in blue envelope from Uiop, Estonia with a yellow foil bag&quot; lol. Be verbose in feedback without compromising the vendor&#039;s security (too much details aids in customs profiling...)<br /><br />Remember you can edit your feedback to review purity, weight etc later. And if asking a vendor something with sensitive details, encrypt your msg for your sake and theirs. <br /><br />Verbose feedback goes a long way to keeping SR healthy. For new vendors, dont be too harsh about these things, approach them with links to the tutorials here about GPG, packing methods, etc but veteran vendors who refuse to use GPG are imo also going to be prone to shipping in ways that result in seizure love letters. <br /><br />No offense intended to vendors OR buyers who send their dox plaintext -- thats your prerogative I am not judging you :) <br />

				I would say with something like MDMA the penalties are so harsh that you might as well go big and just risk one delivery rather than multiple smaller ones especially if its international orders.
