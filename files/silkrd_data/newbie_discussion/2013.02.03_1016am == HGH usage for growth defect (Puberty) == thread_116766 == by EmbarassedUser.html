				Okay, well I have been embarrassed my whole life and am trying to make a change. Hopefully the silk road community can help me. I have never spoken to anyone about this. I am 22 years old living in the US. As a kid, i remember getting curious and squeezing my testicles. My penis flacid is the definition of a &quot;baby dick&quot; (two inches with a girth of maybe 3 inches), erect is 5 inches (not much girth its a &quot;pencil dick&quot;). My voice never really dropped and I have soft skin. I am able to grow my beard in and pubic hairs but if i were to shave i look like a little kid. I have read about testosterone and HGH and keep seeing that it may induce puberty in kids. I am curious to know if I were to take one of these and actually be able to build muscle mass and finally mature. Its something that has me contemplating suicide at times because we all know that sex is a giant part of life and I feel like I will never be able to please a female enough to have her stay with me. This is not a joke, please someone enlighten me.BTW this is a new account I made just for this topic.
