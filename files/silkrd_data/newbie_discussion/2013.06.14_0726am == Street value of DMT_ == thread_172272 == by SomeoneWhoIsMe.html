				Once upon a time, a well versed and sung psychonaut and I considered going Breaking Bad with n, n-dimethaltriptamine. The only thing that would remotely stop us was that ideology held by many of the DMT community that claimed selling for more than the amount to create this glorious product was in bad taste, a magnet for unwanted karma, or a sure-fire way to make pi-dimensional entities from Zork chase you down and punish you.<br /><br />We were both fairly set on this- especially when considering certain people that would purchase in bulk. We constantly looked at the numbers- we considered the worst and the best cases in terms of yield AND economics. It always seemed worth it. And while every variable was adjusted, the street value was something that was only stabbed at.<br /><br />The information given was heresay of only two instances of purchase. One was most definitely low quality product, or 5 MeO DMT. In this instance, $40 did not allow a person to &quot;take off&quot;, although they experienced their arm hairs turning into butterflies.<br /><br />&quot;The word&quot; was that DMT of unconfirmed variety was sold at &quot;$40 per hit&quot;, with two hits believed to be a quality experience. This was 4 months ago, and I have just received &quot;The word&quot; that it has risen to $80 since then.<br /><br />Keeping this information in mind, what would you lot expect to be a good price for the street market? I find the $80 claim to be rather outrageous, but at the same time the selling seems dry and the lips of those willing to purchase wet.

				Bamp- and also if you would be so kind as to leave separately what you think is a fair price, and what you would personally settle for as the highest offer- your responses and the poll will help my understanding of the market (from the perspective of this community) greatly.<br /><br />Feel free also to give any opinions, if you have them, of the moral aspects of this- seeing as DMT (In particular, since many say that psychedelics of any sort should not be sold for profit.) has a unique following of those that don&#039;t think it should be sold for profit at all. I myself understand these values, and I want to settle on a position after selling or having a special session with the substance. Regardless, I&#039;m to conclude that the majority of folk around Silk Road won&#039;t be particularly against making a profit of such trade- the community is still very interesting though, and I&#039;d like to know your thoughts.<br /><br />Thank you.

				id agree with someonewhois me on what he said, if you dont smoke dmt right you wont breakthrough, and if you just spent 25-30$ a hit youd be pretty pissed, my opinion is that most people cant appriciate DMT, they just like getting fucked up, this is not that kind of drug, i got it looking to explore my mind, only to find out that we are so small and there is so much more then us, really i think that DMT is for personal use and maybe friends that you think would be worthy and appriciate the journey their about to go on, ive learned too much and now sometimes i wish i didnt, just because it will make you rethink everything you thought you knew, thats my opinion at least, and i figure thats a lot of deemsters opinions too just by seeing that its hard to get more then a gram at a single order on SR, tell me if this sounds right, i might be off topic to what your thinking too, idk ha

				An interesting part of my situation is that I&#039;ve definitely heard of people that almost use DMT recreationally on a monthly to weekly basis.<br />Even without that demographic though, there is even a market of people that would use it in a more &quot;spiritual&quot; sense- although these people would be the types like airblaster that may disagree with profitable prices.<br /><br />And what is the community&#039;s take on these prices that seem (to me at least) exceptionally high?

				Well, it does appear that 20 mg is the typical &quot;hit&quot;, if three hits is required for a complete breakthrough. Perhaps I am wrong about that though. Perhaps these $80 hits I&#039;ve been hearing about are something closer to 40-60 mg.

				My thoughts on the dippy hippy free drugs shit... I&#039;d rather pay for drugs and for them to be available than to have drugs priced at nothing but, funnily enough, none ever seeming to be available.<br /><br />If they want free drugs they can to the I GIVE DRUGS AWAY FOR FREE GUY. But you know what? They&#039;re not because that guy has already run the fuck out (and you&#039;re selling them.... lol).

				Yea but when I have a large quantity of DMT I am not the type of person to sell to random people. I give to close freinds and they usually want to pay more than I&#039;m willing to take just. I know when they get a supply I&#039;m treated the same way. Not looking to sell on the street, feel that would be unwise given the potency of this molecule and the very real sensation that one has died.

				I just found out that the street price in my area is 300-500 USD a gram, high enough that I&#039;m seriously considering going into business considering the road supplies at around 80~ a gram.<br /><br />And thats the &#039;bulk&#039; per gram price depending on quality, if you start selling it at 50mg hits for 50-80$, the profit gets ridiculous.<br /><br />Just a disgusting profit margin, but then I think about the stigma, LE etc seem to lump DMT into acid and will throw the book at you for selling it. So torn.

				Many people you sell it to may not know what they are getting themselves into. They might have heard from a friend of a friend. Many may freak out, some may be disappointed wanting something that will make them &quot;trip&quot;. For me DMT doesn&#039;t make me trip. It picks me up shakes me off and says &quot;HEY! move towards something higher&quot;

				20mg is barely enough to see stuff, for me at least I need at least 25-35mg.<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy into the superstition and dogma that surrounds DMT. Some say you should never sell it, some say that only those who know how to make it can sell it, others say you should only take it with a shaman present.<br /><br />I say it is a drug and that it can be bought and sold on the black market like any other. Don&#039;t get sucked into the religious style dogma that surrounds it. Just make sure your customers _UNDERSTAND_ what it is going to do to them.
