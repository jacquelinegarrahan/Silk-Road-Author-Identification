				A doctor walked into a bank. Preparing to endorse a check, he pulled a rectal thermometer out of his shirt pocket and tried to &#039;write&#039; with it. Realizing his mistake, he looked at the thermometer with annoyance and said, &quot;Well that&#039;s great, just great... some a**hole&#039;s got my pen.&quot;

				This lady goes into a tattoo parlor and asks the guy to put a tattoo of a turkey on her upper right thigh. <br /><br />She goes back to the same tattoo parlor two weeks later and asks him to tattoo a picture of a Christmas tree on her upper left thigh. <br /><br />Stumped, the guy finally decides to ask her why she wants these tattoos. <br /><br />She said, &quot;I&#039;m tired of my husband complaining every year that there is nothing to eat between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

				two men and a lady were marooned on a deserted Island. After about 3 weeks, the lady became so embarrassed about what she was doing, she killed herself. After about 3 weeks longer, the two men became so embarrassed about what they were doing that they buried her. Another 3 weeks go by, and the men become so embarressed about what they are doing that they dig her back up.

				Some women are gathered and the subject of conversation turns to sex and then birth control. The first woman says, &quot;We&#039;re Catholic so we can&#039;t birth control.&quot; <br /><br />The next woman says, &quot;I am too, but we use the rhythm method.&quot; <br /><br />The third woman says, &quot;We use the bucket and saucer method.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;What the heck is the bucket and saucer method?&quot; the others ask. <br /><br />&quot;Well, I&#039;m five foot eleven...and my husband is five foot two. We make love standing up with him standing on a bucket, and when his eyes get big as saucers, I kick the bucket out from under him.&quot;

				A worried husband, having been commanded by his wife, went to the doctor for a vasectomy. <br />The doctor told him, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, after the operation you will be very horny and you wont worry about getting anyone pregnant.&quot; <br />So the husband got up and left saying, &quot;Never mind, I must have already had one.&quot;

				A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can&#039;t be found. So he drives the farmer&#039;s Porsche back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking! A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, &#039;I think I can stand over the hole!&#039; So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, &#039;Grab for my &#039;thingy&#039; and pull yourself up.&#039; And the chicken did and pulled himself to safety. The moral of the story: If you are hung like a horse, you don&#039;t need a Porsche to pick up chicks!
