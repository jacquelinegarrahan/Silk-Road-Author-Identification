				Yeah. I can understand some one falling for a scam if its like a random link. But do they really think they are going to get any suckers with 3 pages of spam? Im a newb but shit... Anyone who falls for that probably deserve to lose.

We&#039;re not always in the Newbie discussion forum but we do tend to spend quite a bit of time in here helping newer members out. The 50 post restriction generally keeps the spammers confined to the Newbie discussion forum and gives us a chance to get rid of them before they can disrupt discussion on the main forums.<br /><br />Some people do follow the links, or at least they have done in the past - that&#039;s why they keep coming back, unfortunately.<br /><br />Libertas
