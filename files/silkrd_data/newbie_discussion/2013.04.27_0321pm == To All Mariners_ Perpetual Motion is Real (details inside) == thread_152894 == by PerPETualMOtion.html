				Ocean waves, wind, and global atmospheric-water movement will never stop until all gravity in our relative vicinity settles and ceases to stir tectonic, tidal, and Coriolis motion. Our Sun pumps nearly 4 million exajoules per annum into the Earth. That&#039;s <br /><br />4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. 4.2 joules will heat one gram of water one degree Celsius. However, this is somewhat misleading because energy transfer is never 100% due to thermodynamic entropy that destabilizes the solution of water. In other words, heating is not linear, so 420 joules will theoretically boil one gram of water from 0 degree Celsius, but in practice, there is inefficiencies due to energy-mass transfer kinetics. Lasers are helping this situation dramatically.<br /><br />Earth&#039;s natural resources are complementary to this natural fusion resource, some ninety billion miles away. Our resources are better spent studying the sun and using the energy waste of the fusion process, instead of reinventing the wheel, so to speak. All those resources spent building the Large Hadron Collider and model fusion reactors could have put humans closer to settling the energy-economic deficit that weather inflicts on cities and states, and sometimes entire continents: earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis. Think about a Hadron Collider with Yottawatts of energy to smash particles: creating more interesting particles than the waste from a natural fusion star. Bosons, schmosons, I say. They are but little bits of an infinite puzzle.... <br /><br />To ever make a bold a statement as the God Particle--even in the case of bold marketing strategies--is pure ignorance, claiming to build a ladder to Heaven--or worse: to ever claim to know God or that there is a Heaven and make declarations about such insanity (schizophrenia and/or psychosis). <br /><br />Think bigger, and our species will grow. Think within our own means, and remain stagnant and war-torn. Use your imagination, and life will be filled with happiness and success.

				Sailing cargo, slowing down global trade, puts more emphasis on quality and more efficient technology within our global economic infrastructure. As the middle class rises, such things as organic produce and sustainable textiles becomes more important, and global trade is the next step for stabilizing this socioeconomic culture of sustainability and intellectual development.
