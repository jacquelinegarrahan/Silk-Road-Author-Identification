				Is there any reason this can&#039;t happen?<br />Hell i&#039;m spamming away with the rest of them, but it&#039;s nice to actually enter into some discussion while being a newbie and the endless spam threads make finding interesting content harder.<br />But this is no doubt gonna get berried by spam threads anyway

				I personally think spamming should be banned. If new people joining the forum cannot say 50 valuable, helpful or interesting things then there should be no reason they should be posting throughout the forums. I realize it&#039;s hard to have integrity while being an anonymous person and I also realize that newbies have intelligent things to add at times. Post count and karma are not always the best way of judging comments but it would work a lot better if people couldn&#039;t spam there way up to fifty posts. I feel as though the information and communication throughout the newbie forum would be a lot more interesting if people had conversations instead of starting and posting on spam threads.<br /><br />Will members look at you the same if they look back and see you made 50 spam posts in one day. Maybe not, but I will, not that anyone really cares what a newbie thinks.

				There should just be one thread for spamming, there are so many spam threads now that its hard to even find content that you may be looking for, or questions that people asked get bumped downwards without answer because people simply cannot see it.<br /><br />Admins please close all the spam threads and leave just ONE for the sake of this forum! thanks!

				The Newbie Discussion Forum could be as valuable as every other discussion if people get over the &quot;race to 50&quot; posts. I&#039;m trying to defeat the spam with intelligent (or at least half-intelligent) responses.<br /><br />Have you seen my &quot;First Post&quot;?<br /><br />Anyway, as recommended by--I think--sleepyeyes, we all need to learn our constitution (or whatever local legal framework is in place).<br /><br />5th through 8th Amendments. Start with Wiki... then do some more digging with Supreme Court cases...<br /><br />Learn what &quot;Discovery&quot; means in the court of law (US).<br /><br />Keep your mouth shut if you get arrested. The less you say, the better off you are. It may frustrate the officer, causing him/her to make a mistake. Mistakes in processing are easy ways to win a case! Technicalities

				I agree.. i guess the major problem is like most have stated already.. this newbie section is just FLOODED with spam threads.. a few good vendors have put a secondary review thread here just for the newbies but its a pain to scroll through all these spam threads.. <br /><br />ive never spammed on a board but then again i have never been locked into a &quot;newbie&quot; section only on a forum. most have been X amount of post before you can send/receive private messages, or go into the classified sections of the boards if they have em. <br /><br />i see waaaaaayyy more threads of interest to me in the security and other sections which i would like to reply an carry on discussion about but i guess i will be waiting like the rest while i have time to drop a few more spam post to get out of lockdown&nbsp; 8)

If you really need to spam then doing it in just the one thread isn&#039;t actually such a bad idea but it may send the wrong message.<br /><br />Try and use your time getting to 50 constructively and invest time to research the forums and educate yourself on how to navigate SR safely. The entire purpose of creating the newbie sub forum was to reduce the amount of spam and duplicate threads created on subjects already posted elsewhere. <br /><br />Many people do not take the time to use the search function before posting things already covered which just clogs up the forums with multiple threads and reduces the effectiveness of information sharing.<br />

				The 50 post minimum is a good idea in theory, but so many good topics get overlooked on this board because it&#039;s mostly people asking how to get BTC and other simple stuff that should be known or found out by googling, not that hard to do. If you can find your way to SR, you can read a BTC guide.
