				Pretty good show. It does a good job of presenting dramatically the reasons to be against the Drug War. Also great story and acting. Makes being a chemistry teacher look pretty badass. Kind of wish I had gone into bio-chem now, hahaha&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s your thoughts on it? I&#039;ve never been around the meth crowd (not directly. I work in film and have had some actors in that crowd but not hung out there myself.) and I imagine it&#039;s a little bit blown out of proportion, but it also seems to be made by people who are &quot;one of us&quot; so to speak, and not overly sensationalized. Thoughts?

				A bit late, for sure! I&#039;ve been wicked busy and meaning to get around to it. It was first on my back catalogue. Also going to start The Wire and Venture Brothers soon. <br /><br />Season 2 is starting to drag a little. The drama was good in the first season but I think it&#039;s starting to drag the relationship stuff through the mud, starting to bog it down. I think they&#039;re trying to build up to a big finale. I&#039;ll see how it goes though!<br /><br />

				Damn. I like how they showed the relationship stuff in the first season. Show don&#039;t tell is the old adage, and they did a good job of showing. Maybe this episodes just been really dark, and watching them all at once isn&#039;t the optimal way to watch it.
