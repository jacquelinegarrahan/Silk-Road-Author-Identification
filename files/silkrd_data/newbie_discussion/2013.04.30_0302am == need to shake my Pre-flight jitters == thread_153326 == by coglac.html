				Sooo, a few months ago I had my first breakthrough on my first time trying DMT. I was alone and i did not know what I was doing. I got 100 mg of mahakala and killed it in one rip. needless to say my experience was beyond intense, eye opening, life changing. I have been trying to go back every since, but I have yet to have a breakthrough of the same magnitude. I find my self terrified when blasting off. Does anyone else have this feeling, even though I know I will love it and it is the most amazing thing ever once I am there, I just cant shake this feeling of dread while I am blasting off. <br />Anyone know any tips to help with this?

				I&#039;m not a DMT expert by any means but have you tried some cannabis to mellow you out beforehand? I typically take some ghb about 30 minute prior to tripping if a psychedelic is making me nervous.

				Well. I don&#039;t know if i can post websites or not. But this is not advertizing in any way. But I suggest listening to this before you trip. And possibly even during (you will need to listen with headphones or it won&#039;t work). http://free-binaural-beats.com/theta-4-5hz/

				The general rule for posting a link that&#039;s not a .onion is to give a clearnet warning before the link. Well I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a rule but I see a lot of people do it.

The resonating of my voice makes me feel much safer, like I&#039;m grounding myself until I feel comfortable then I can dive right into the experience.
