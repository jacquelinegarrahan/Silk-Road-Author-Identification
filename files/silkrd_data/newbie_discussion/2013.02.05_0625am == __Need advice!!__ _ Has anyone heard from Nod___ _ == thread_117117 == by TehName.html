				Placed an order w/ Nod on Friday morn &amp; was initially told it would go out that same day via express, but then later that night when asking about when to expect its arrival time, was told that he decided not ship anything that day, due to a &quot;scare&quot;... He said&nbsp; push my delivery date to tuesday, which I was pretty bummed about, having pushed for express in order to have it saturday as a surprise for the wifey&#039;s bday festivities, but I understand the need for such precautions. I was hopeful that maybe hed hook it up a bit extra for the wait&nbsp; :P .... Well its been about 3 days now, and I havent heard from him still, and the messages Ive sent asking if it went out successfully on sunday as planned still all say &quot;unread&quot;.... Im pretty worried that something is either up with him, or something? Cant put my finger on it, but seems like he was much more responsive than this prior to the &quot;scare&quot;..... On a different note though, it seems like a few people received their orders this morning, as there were several new reviews on his page.... I just dont know what to think.<br /><br />So, has anyone spoken to him today?&gt;
