				This thread is the same as our one in &#039;the rumor mill&#039; but as you have to have 50 posts to comment there we thought the newbie section would be easier for many of our customers .<br /><br />Hi fellow New Zealanders and Middle Earthers , we are&nbsp; &nbsp;new kiwi vendors&nbsp; and&nbsp; we aim to be supplying&nbsp; high grade cannabis consumables to you&nbsp; with Ghandelfs blessing&nbsp; &nbsp;;) .<br /><br />&nbsp;This is the place for you to leave longer reviews of our buds,&nbsp; or to ask general questions about our strains and other things&nbsp; if your thinking of buying ...... I’m sure we’ll get some suggestions to&nbsp; ....&nbsp; which we’ll evaluate in typical&nbsp; weta fashion&nbsp; 8) 8) <br /><br />We’ll be posting up news of any upcoming products or happenings in weta land and we’ll try to keep you informed of things relevant to New Zealand silk road&nbsp; cannabis users. <br /><br />Sticky Weta’s also believe ordinary kiwi’s who grow the herb, either&nbsp; for themselves or to share with others,&nbsp; are helping in the world wide fight to&nbsp; OverGrow&nbsp; unjust laws. We salute you but we’d like to see more of you cannabis resistance fighters out there.<br />&nbsp;<br />As part of that philosophy&nbsp; we will be offering clones of our&nbsp; high class strains in the very near future for those who wish to become a kiwi OverGrower. We are also more than happy to give advice to the best of our ability on any indoor NZ cannabis growing questions.<br /><br />But before any of that I’m going to try and answer what I anticipate will be frequently asked questions regarding&nbsp; placing orders with us and how we conduct business.<br /><br />Q&nbsp; : Do I have to use my real name when placing the order ?<br />A&nbsp; &nbsp;: NZ post does not&nbsp; know who is moving in and out of flats and houses so as long as the address is valid and the name not stupid ie Donald Duck , then the mail should get delivered like any other . BUT dont use a false name if you can not guarantee that you are the one who empty&#039;s your mail box.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Q&nbsp; : How secure/stealthy is the order.<br />A&nbsp; &nbsp;: We double vacuum seal&nbsp; and use multi layer protection&nbsp; on your order. It will not matter if&nbsp; it gets wet and needs a determined effort to open it. You can not tell what it is.<br /><br />Q&nbsp; : How good is your pot<br />A&nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;All our strains are from Dutch or Canadian seed banks,&nbsp; they are grown well with no insecticides or other toxins.&nbsp; The heads are well manicured with no excessive stalk and there is no ‘shake’ in the bags.&nbsp; Our buds are high grade and the equal of or often better than what you will smoke in a dutch coffee shop.<br /><br />Q&nbsp; : If Sticky weta got busted would you have my address which the police could find ?<br />A&nbsp; &nbsp;: We keep NO records , your address is put on your package immediately before it goes out the door&nbsp; and then we no longer have it in&nbsp; ANY form<br /><br />If I find we are getting other questions asked a lot I’ll add them to this list.........<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />And&nbsp; finally just a few words on security for us New Zealanders .<br /><br />To any new kiwi users or visitors to silk road we IMPLORE you to be using the tor bundle browser or some equivalent .<br /><br />With the passing of the GSCB spy on every fucking person bill, and the equally fascist TICS bill on the way now is not the time to be a sleepy sheep.<br /><br />With the blue Orc National&nbsp; Government&nbsp; granting itself and its bully boys the right to intercept and spy on&nbsp; all of our communications&nbsp; we STRONGLY SUGGEST that if you do place an order with us or any other vendor&nbsp; on silk road to&nbsp; encrypt your address using the&nbsp; public keys.<br /><br />If you don’t know how ...., go and&nbsp; download gpg4usb, its very friendly to learn, simple to use and a bloody good tool for us in our peaceful rebellion against the forces of the evil empire.<br /><br />P.s our first orders started going out Wednesday, you&#039;ll start seeing vendor&nbsp; stats and reviews as the mail gets delivered ............&nbsp; ;D ;D 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) ;D ;D

				Greetings lads, great to see new NZ vendors. Hopefully you are in for the long haul! It&#039;s been unfortunate with the demise of many sellers, but your produce looks the goods.<br /><br />I notice that your selling 1/4 ounces and was wondering if you would consider selling in grams. It would be sweet to try a couple grams of each variety for example, although I could see why that could be a pain in the ass at your end.<br /><br />I found a sweet quote about the Romulan ...&quot;This variety was nicknamed Romulan after people joked that the high “could dent your head,” producing ridges like those of Star Trek’s warrior-like race with the same name.&quot;<br /><br />What would you consider is the strongest of you strains?

				Greetings crystalbluepersuasion&nbsp; :) that&nbsp; romulan description sounds just like the rom girl&nbsp; we used to know&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Out of the 3 listings we have up the rom diesel might just pip the other two for strength of stone but it would be a very close thing .........&nbsp; when it comes to strength of smell she wins hands down, strength of taste is also very strong but VERY different from the other two girls&nbsp; which in turn are different from each other<br /><br />&nbsp;Btw I call cannabis plants or strains &#039;girls&#039; because the heads we smoke are always from females.<br /><br />But the white skunk certainly is not shy in the resin production and same with diamond girl.<br /><br />The white skunk came to one of our gardeners in clone form from a very experienced and respected grower. We were told it was a skunk no1 cross with white widow. It grows much like the skunk no1 which our gardener had previously grown but he reports it fills in better with &#039;spears&#039; for buds and more resin. The &#039;freshness&#039; in the taste which has been likened to eucalyptus/vicks/menthol/spearmint is probably from the skunk with the fruitiness coming from the widow.<br /><br />Diamond girl is a 4 way cross and is greenhouse seed bank&#039;s imitation or &#039;knock off&#039; of Sensi seeds &#039;silver pearl &#039;. The person who got the seeds had been trying to buy &#039;silver pearl&#039; but at the time Sensi no longer seemed to sell it.<br /><br />The breeding in diamond girl is from memory skunk no1 x early pearl x haze x northern lights . I think it unlikely greenhouse seeds replicated all the crossing and breeding and they probably just brought Sensi&#039;s silver pearl seeds, grew to maturity&nbsp; some male and female plants and used these to make their diamond girl seeds.<br /><br />Its a quality plant, it displays true hybrid vigor and its buds are high class and heavily coated in resin BUT it is not Silver Pearl as Sensi had it. Although it grows big like a Sativa its buds have a distinct&nbsp; Afi flavor about them.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />You can find a bit more about the rom diesel&nbsp; at&nbsp; &#039;next generation seeds&#039; and&nbsp; greenhouse seeds for diamond girl.<br /><br />As my Wally of a father used to say, &#039;Its bad luck to be superstitious&#039;&nbsp; ;) , but I always touch wood when I say this.&nbsp; We hope to be on the road for a while with Ghandelf&#039;s blessings and there are some different glittering&nbsp; girls on the way.<br /><br />I&#039;ll talk to the Weta&#039;s packers and shippers union to see if we cant offer a smaller sample&nbsp; in our listings, but last time I mentioned this to them&nbsp; they tried to bite me&nbsp; :o&nbsp; <br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :) 8) :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Orders have been processed and sent for our two new listings so keep your eyes out for buyers reviews of the rom diesel &amp; Diamond girl on our vendors page.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />Most customers are using encryption when placing an order which is great.<br /><br />There was the impression&nbsp; created in the main steam media that encryption had been broken, this was False&nbsp; .<br /><br />I recomend&nbsp; visiting this link to learn the truth in the matter.<br />&nbsp;http://publicaddress.net/onpoint/the-gift-that-keeps-on-making-me-barf/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, have a look at the other posts as they relate to gpg4usb and our new spy laws in New Zealand.<br />--------------<br /><br />Lastly we&#039;d like to give some kudo&#039;s to &#039;middleearth&#039; &amp; &#039;Countdown&#039;, these were two new Zealand vendors who blazed a trail before us, they helped inspire the Weta&#039;s with their excellent service and high standards.<br />We especially miss MiddleEarth , wish him the best and hope one day he returns .............&nbsp; 8)

				Just found a thread on how to do pgp for mac - <br /><br />First, I&#039;ll say I&#039;m on Mac and I use GPGTools. I was at first confused at how to encrypt a message without having to use their e-mail tool. I found the info I needed, but it was confusingly difficult to find it. Here&#039;s how it worked for me:<br /><br />1) Create your key — In the Keychain Access window, creating/exporting/importing keys is super simple. I won&#039;t go into much detail here, because it&#039;s unnecessary. Besides, you will only need to create a key whenever you feel you need a new one, and otherwise this window is basically just a list of all the keys you&#039;ve gathered from other people.<br /><br />Note: when you create a key, you need a passphrase for that key. If you forget this passphrase, you are fucked. No excuses, no recovery. Deal with it.<br /><br />2) Setting up your GPG shortcuts — This is the part that hangs people up I think. I would recommend you go to your System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts -&gt; Services (left box) and then go to Text in the right box. Scroll down and check all the OpenPGP options. If you can handle this, the hard part is literally over. Read on.<br /><br />3) Encrypting — Open TextEdit or your favorite text editor, and type your message. Literally just type whatever you want to say. Got everything? Cool. Highlight your message, right-click it, and go down on your pop-up menu to Services. When that pops open, you&#039;ll see the GPG options you enabled in Step 2! Click Encrypt Selection, select your key when prompted, deselect Add to Recipients and BOOM now your message is encrypted.<br /><br />4) Decrypting — To decrypt a message from someone, you will first need their Public key. Find it, highlight it, and right-click your selection. Go down to Services again and select Import Key from Selection -- There you go. Key imported. Now to decrypt their message, just highlight it and right-click, go to Services, and click Decrypt Message from Selection. Choose the key you just imported. Now the message is in clear text.<br /><br />5) How do you know your own public key? — Go to Keychain Access and select the key you made for yourself. Export it, and do not include your private key. That will spit out an .asc file which is just plain text, open it in TextEdit to see your public key.<br /><br />Note: When encrypting/decrypting/importing you should go ahead and include the ---START PGP MESSAGE--- or ---START PGP PUBLIC KEY--- along with the corresponding END phrases to make sure you get it all.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am using OSX Lion.<br /><br /><br /><br />and to put in SR vendors details:<br /><br />Select the key you created for yourself (btw, using a dummy e-mail address is perfectly fine -- however, most people would recommend attaching your public key to a tormail.org account or something similarly &quot;anonymous&quot; that can be used as a backup form of communication) and click &quot;Export&quot; in Keychain Access. You won&#039;t need to include your private key unless you are transferring your GPG info to another machine, so leave that box unchecked.<br /><br />This will spit out a .asc file, which when opened shows your PUBLIC KEY in plain text.<br /><br />Quick rundown: Your public key is what other people will use to encrypt messages for YOU. You should always include your public key in any kind of initial correspondance so when people reply to you, you can &quot;unlock&quot; or decrypt it on your end.<br /><br />So here&#039;s a quick refresher to where we are now: You can now see your PUBLIC KEY, your PRIVATE KEY is stored in Keychain Access automatically, and you should have picked a passphrase you can remember when you created your key in the first place.<br /><br />Now, the next step is to import a key from someone you are trying to communicate with. If you follow my steps above, this should be as simple as highlighting the Public Key Block on the vendor profile page, right clicking your selection, and going to Services -&gt; Import Key from Selection...<br /><br />Now in Keychain Access window you should see a key related to you, and a key related to your intended recipient.<br /><br />Type your message in TextEdit or whatever your favorite text editor is and then at the bottom, just paste your public key there. Now, press Apple+A or select EVERYTHING in the text window, and right click it, and go to Services -&gt; Encrypt Selection... -- you will be prompted with a window. Select the VENDOR who you imported earlier, and your message should automatically turn to an encrypted PGP message.<br /><br />You can now no longer decrypt this message (although you can undo the encryption by pressing Apple+Z or going to Edit -&gt; Undo).<br /><br />If you follow along, step by step, and apply your mind to the process and really make an honest attempt to understand it... you&#039;ll see it&#039;s a rather simple process with a lot of small steps. Once you get it down, you&#039;ll get it forever. Like riding a bike. :)<br /><br />thanks to Tortoisehell @ Reddit.

				Communication: 5/5<br />When deciding on a vendor to buy from on SR I feel that communication is the most important part of the process. After talking to sticky weta heads it was obvious that he was a serious contender; his replies were quick, information was accurate, he advised on methods of encryption to make the overall process as secure as possible and he was just very pleasant to communicate with in general. Very professional communication and the best NZ vendor in terms of communication.<br /><br /><br />Quality: 5/5<br />White Skunk 7g<br />When the buds came I was overwhelmed by the smell after opening the bag and then I was delighted when I looked inside and saw the crystals gleaming off them. The highest quality buds I’ve smoked from an NZ vendor (Note: Haven’t tried gladsnap due to his extreme prices). Wasn’t too much in the way of stalks - a nice surprise considering the buds were overweight by a few grams according to my kitchen scale (which might not be 100% accurate, but it was showing 11g!). Has a nice head high and then you find yourself couch locked. <br /><br />Romulan Diesel Sample<br />Being one of the first to purchase from weta he was kind enough to send a sample of his Romulan Diesel - I didn’t complain! The smell was pretty amazing and hard to describe but apparently I wrote down “smells like lentils” after smoking it but I can’t recall how accurate that was so take it with a pinch of salt! Very strong indica effects and has a nice taste if vaping imo.<br /><br />Pics:<br />https://bayimg.com/jAAEgaAfc&nbsp; &nbsp;Left: Romulan Diesel&nbsp; &nbsp;Right: White Skunk<br />https://bayimg.com/jaAELaAfC&nbsp; &nbsp;Romulan Diesel<br />https://bayimg.com/jaAeOaaFC<br /><br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Stealth was impressive. I won’t go too in depth about this for obvious reasons but it was well packaged and took a long time for me to be able to tell the contents of the package assuming I didn’t know what was in it beforehand.<br /><br /><br />Price: 5/5<br />Sticky weta heads has the best priced bud in NZ by a fair margin currently. This was probably the biggest selling point for me because of the competition overpricing by so much. I really hope that the prices aren’t inflated too much later on!<br /><br />Overall: 5/5<br />Sticky weta buds is a quality NZ vendor that I very much welcome to the scene. He is a pleasure to talk to and seems to know his stuff about both bud and SR. I will return to purchase from him especially if prices remain as [comparably] low and highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy in NZ.

				Hello bigbangbudtheory &amp; Oracle of Ra, thanks for dropping in&nbsp; :)<br /><br />bigbangbudtheory, $30-$40 for a clone with established roots is what we are thinking, postage will be a little more because of the greater expense and effort in packaging a living thing with it still being alive and ready to grow at the end of its&nbsp; journey.<br /><br />The clones will be one and the same&nbsp; as the finished heads we are selling. If it is a white skunk clone you buy it will produce identical buds/smoke to the white skunk cannabis we sell AS LONG as it is grown in roughly the same manner ( good conditions ) AND dried properly.&nbsp; I hope that answers your questions&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Oracle of Ra, thanks for the fulsome&nbsp; review, its our very&nbsp; first forum review and we&#039;re glad it follows in the positive way&nbsp; what our other buyers have been saying on our vendors page&nbsp; :) 8) :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But I&#039;ll give a weta&#039;s view on some of the&nbsp; points raised by Oracle of Ra .<br /><br />First off we are a small New Zealand operation selling only to New Zealanders and this allows us to take time and care with each customer. We enjoy helping fellow MiddleEarther&#039;s&nbsp; and its a privilege pointing you to tools like gpg4usb,&nbsp; which help protect you, and that would really fuck of John Key if he ever got to know about it&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />We get the best pot we can and we&#039;re probably a bit of a pain to our gardeners, because we want the highest standards and best of what they&#039;ve got. We ask them for longer flushing, better trimming, dryer drying, more generous weighing and the creme&nbsp; of their crop.<br /><br />The prices are set at least for the medium term and more expensive strains like the rom diesel are a reflection&nbsp; of scarcity and production, ie a low producing plant that has low numbers growing will be more expensive.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want to judge gladsnaps prices because for all we know he may be buying his pot for $300 per ounce. But we&nbsp; will say he was selling high grade cannabis ( judging by his reviews ) before the weta&#039;s came along silk road&nbsp; and he may have provided pot to people who had no other way of getting it and he deserves kudo&#039;s for that.<br /><br />Also he has different strains from us and covers the smaller 1 gram amounts which weta&#039;s are to clumsy to deal with.<br /><br />Weta&#039;s take the view that different high quality cannabis vendors finally gives New Zealanders the chance to order their pot like they were in a Dutch coffee shop ......... and thats a good thing&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Finally the weta&#039;s despite being millions of years old are evolving to our changing landscape&nbsp; :o<br /><br />We&#039;re always going to be looking at improvements in the way we work and we&#039;ll always be trying to give MiddleEarthers a fair go and a fair deal<br />&nbsp; :) :) : 8) 8) 8) 8) 8) : :) :)

				Hey SWH,<br /><br />Just replying about the 3 gram sample pack. My hobbit footed friend and I tried all 3 strains the other day in an informal Cannabis club session. We started with the Romulan which we both thought was quite citrus-y and hit us hard. We then moved onto the White Skunk which hit us for 6 with massive thick smoke clouds filling the room. We finished off with the Diamond girl which was tasty and was more of a body stone for us. <br /><br />I have been very impressed with the whole process and can tell that there has been a lot of thought and effort go in. Your gardeners should be very happy with their product and I can&#039;t wait to try what else they have in store ... any hints? It&#039;s also been fun reading up on the strains, it&#039;s great to be informed.<br /><br />For the record, I have tried gladsnap&#039;s product, and it&#039;s nothing to be frowned over. My opinion is the SWH is in an upper echalon though and will continue to shop there.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi crystalbluepersuasian, thanks for the kind words&nbsp; :)&nbsp; and once more I must thank MiddleEarth ( the vendor ) who inspired the weta&#039;s onto the road by us sampling his excellent products and service.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />We aim to be as good and follow in his footsteps for excellent quality, good service&nbsp; and fair pricing, but the weta&#039;s will only every specialize in cannabis and its products. <br /><br />&nbsp;I was just about to put up a new listing for Afghani or Afi but silk road was down for maintenance.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quick description ...... She&#039;s got that full on Afi smell but with a bit of a strawberry&nbsp; sweetness in the mix. Its a very hearty smoke and most joints I&#039;ve shared&nbsp; result in people dropping off them before they are finished. Very stoney, spacey calming smoke with a ton of flavor. I&#039;ve smoked a few afi&#039;s and this is in the top shelf group.<br /><br />There are some other girls coming along and this weta&#039;s favorite ones are still to come ..........<br /><br />Now I must pop back to the road and see if I can get that listing up&nbsp; :)

				A message to our kiwi customers in this turbulent day on silk road.<br /><br />1) keep calm and watch developments, weta&#039;s sense a hackers hoax because a lot of things do not stack up and the weta has personally seen a hack attack&nbsp; which caused the&nbsp; Cannabis Culture website&nbsp; have its front page changed&nbsp; and from memory it was 48 hours before the site controllers fixed the&nbsp; and regained control.<br /><br />2) For our customers ....... Once your order was marked/clicked&nbsp; in transit , silk road deletes all your shopping cart address details, the only thing left for us, or silk road administrators or hackers or who-ever to see is your user name and what&nbsp; &nbsp;you brought.<br /><br />3) We had one order still to be marked in transit where the buyer had not encrypted their address ... But even that customer is sweet because we are going to hold of until everyone has a accurate picture of whats going on.<br /><br />4) Everyone of our customers who had their order marked in transit will receive it because they have been sent and you can all get stoned for the weekend<br /><br />5) Relax, there&#039;s more sheep on these forums than in our wobbly Isles and its a big echo chamber for a lot of people of cant think for themselves ........... The weta&#039;s are out of the box, we&#039;ll be back ( and we think silk road will too ).<br /><br />6) The plants keep growing&nbsp; :) 8) :)&nbsp;

				Hey SWH,<br /><br />From http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s unstated from when the investigation started, but the FBI received a complete copy of the Silk Road web server on the 23rd of July 2013. This was all done under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which implies that they had access to current site information up until the point they shut the site down.<br />This included user account and transaction information. It&#039;s unclear whether or not this covers addresses and other sensitive transaction information.<br />**This also apparently covers at least 60 days worth of messages from the period where the site was copied.<br />From February 6, 2011 to July 23 2013, 9,519,664BTC was generated in sales, 614,305BTC going directly to DPR in the way of &quot;commissions&quot;. This comes to a total of 1,229,465 transactions.<br />Based on the copy of the site which the FBI received, they believe DPR to have been the sole operator and owner of SR, handling all aspects of the site himself and delegating only user affairs to appointed moderators.<br />---<br /><br />It&#039;s not looking too flash at the moment - will they go after small time purchases of pot though? Highly unlikely.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure something will pop up in the near future that is bigger, stronger, more secure than the silk road.<br /><br />It looks like Pirate Dread Roberts many quite a few basic errors in getting busted.

				Hiya crystalbluepersuasion, if you were encrypted no one but a weta&#039;s ever seen your address.<br /><br />We do not decrypt the messages on silk road.<br /><br />I watched this unfold last night and all I&#039;ll say is believe nothing and relax if you brought of us ..... and if you did buy of us we recommend smoking the evidence as a matter&nbsp; of course.<br /><br />I we think the silk road being taken down will be as effective at stopping&nbsp; encrypted on line drug trading as the take down of Napstar stopped all those illegal downloads&nbsp; ............<br /><br />I must say though, that all this excitement on silk road will be very effective at getting future buyers to use PGP and thats a bloody good thing&nbsp; .<br /><br />When cannabis culture got hacked years ago it was down for days, that lead me to OverGrow which the best thing ever for me.<br /><br />Anyway Weta&#039;s say keep calm and smoke a fatty&nbsp; <br /><br />

				hi pcviper we have been looking at the other markets and think that BMR looks the most promising, sheep is very new but BMR has been around for a while.<br /><br />In the meantime you can e-mail us at stickywetaheads@Safe-mail.net&nbsp; but we want every-one to encrypt all messages for both our safety or we will not reply.<br /><br />We&#039;re sure you understand why ..... we do not want our feelers pinched.<br /><br />Cheers SW and keep an eye on BMR ( Black Market Reloaded )
