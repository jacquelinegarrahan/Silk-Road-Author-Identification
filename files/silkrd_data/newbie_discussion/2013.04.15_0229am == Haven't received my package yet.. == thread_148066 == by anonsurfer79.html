				I haven&#039;t received a package of molly that shipped out saturday night on the 6th. I have been pretty paranoid to the fact that 2 other packages didn&#039;t show up to the house that should have that are from ebay.It was first class so that might have something to do with it. I am sure it&#039;s usps fault but I just felt like asking this question. Plus i need more posts anyways.

				The way the mail goes, it might not have really gone out until Monday the 8th.&nbsp; IMHO, it should have arrived by Saturday the 12th.&nbsp; I&#039;d be very concerned, but I don&#039;t know what to suggest doing about it.&nbsp; If this was domestic US Mail going from one end of the country to the other it could take 3 days or more.

				You should extend the time, or ask for a refund. The escrow system has those 2 options for this cases.
