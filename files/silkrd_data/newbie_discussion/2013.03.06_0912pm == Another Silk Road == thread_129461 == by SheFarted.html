				Why hasnt there been another site similar to Silk Road been created yet.&nbsp; Spread it out a little bit, instead of all the focus be on SR. A little competition never hurt anyone.

				well there was the farmers market LOL and people have already mentioned black market reloaded. never used it and have no inclination to do so. <br />there was some word a few weeks ago of a new competitor site called sheep which just sounds dodgy from the name. to be fair there could be loads of similar sites on a smaller scale that are just way more underground and managing to stay that way. i get what you mean about competition but this site has taken around 2 years to get to where it is now. you can&#039;t just create something like this overnight.

				BMR, yeah, some Silk Road vendors are on there, but some vendors on BMR take the name of successful vendors on SR and SCAM. So beware.

				For the record I&#039;ve tried sheep and BMR.&nbsp; Each have their qualities .&nbsp; &nbsp;BMR is about younger crowd.&nbsp; Teens wanting guns and shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Too hard to tell who is legit and not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Escrow works good though, although most vendors will try to get you to FE.<br /><br />Sheep is like Italian or something, it&#039;s quite nice design.&nbsp; &nbsp;I find its better for vendors because you can add more Picts and details and web design stuff to help sell.&nbsp; It&#039;s escrow is clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ya, it&#039;s hard to tell what is legit these days.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s all made up by the CIA to study drug users more closely. . Hehe. They can keep an eye on all of us this way and how much we are spending.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just kidding. <br /><br />There are sr vendors on all these sites.&nbsp; That&#039;s just good marketing for them.&nbsp; If sr goes down, I know where to start shopping again in a few minutes. Wool hoo!<br /><br />But ya,&nbsp; I think there should be dozens of sites. Just like mp3 sites when they came out.&nbsp; First was napster ,&nbsp; then so many song sites, the government gave up on trying to regulate it.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Apple ITunes Store will soon have a idrugStore.&nbsp; &nbsp;Order drugs through your iTunes. :-)<br />

				yep true that. I&#039;m on BMR and sell shrooms there (link in sig) and been on for 2 weeks and only was able to get out 2 samples so far with the first sale just 3 days ago . I tried to become a vendor here just when they raised it to 500 bucks vendor fee, so I had to go there as it&#039;s only 1 BTC to become a vendor. I can&#039;t afford 500 bucks so maybe if I make enough BTC there I can come here<br /><br />it&#039;s tru tho BMR is not nearly as much traffic as here.&nbsp; 2 weeks and 250 views on my shroom page, most in the last few days. It&#039;s tough starting out but I got time. I figure BMR will become more popular with the smaller vendors like me, especially as it helps us keep it cheaper. My cyans are half the price of the cyans here, and I&#039;m sure part of that is the higher fees here<br /><br />but it&#039;s like 10 times the traffic here. I&#039;m willing to bet both will just keep getting bigger the longer they stay up tho, especially with more press, and probably more SR like competitors in the future<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129461.msg886899#msg886899">Quote from: LSB16 on March 06, 2013, 11:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I agree BMR pales in comparison, but maybe they just need some time, for now I love the magical place known as SR....I hope it has a long and safe run!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I guess it depends on which drugs you&#039;re looking for. Shrooms and especially wild cyanescens is all I know and there&#039;s only one vendor here on SR for that, and I&#039;m the only vendor on BMR for that, and all I know is my prices are half of his. here&#039;s the listing on SR<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bc0a22902c<br /><br />All I know is this guy also sells a lot of other stuff and it&#039;s highly unlikely he&#039;s the actual picker and likely gets it from the picker so he&#039;s the middle man. I also just noticed his ratings are going down from last week. Now it&#039;s 90 and it was 99 a week ago. and this is probably because of all his other chemicals he&#039;s selling. I bet that cyanescens is a tiny tiny part of his sales.&nbsp; He&#039;s chargin .54 BTC which is a little over 20 bucks a gram right now. I&#039;m charging .27 BTC a gram which is 12 bucks a gram. I can do that cause I&#039;m the picker and i don&#039;t sell anything else<br /><br />Granted psilocybe cyanescens is a very niche market. It&#039;s almost unknown outside the pacific Northwest because you can&#039;t grow it indoors. The only way you can do it is either transplant outside or go hunt them yourself and dry it and store it in vacuum<br /><br />I&#039;m sure for a lot of other drugs SR would be cheaper, but not this one, at least not until I make the 25BTC so I can come here and compete. So far we are the only ones who have P cyanescens. It&#039;s THAT rare and hard to get<br /><br />but this is a highly specialized example. It isn&#039;t something you can make in a lab
