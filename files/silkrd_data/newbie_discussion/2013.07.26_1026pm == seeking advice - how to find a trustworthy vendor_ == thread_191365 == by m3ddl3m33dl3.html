				Hey there man<br />I&#039;ve got a bit of advice since im really familiar with the site and how to judge vedors. Theres a couple ways you can go about checking<br />A) If you click on the vendors name, it will bring you to their &#039;vendors&#039; page. If you read the top, it will give a percentage (97 and higher is very good), this means 97% positive feedback. In the same paragraph at the top, it will say this vendor is in the top &#039;blank&#039; percentage of vendors on the site. This stat isnt as important but worth a look<br />B) Message the vendor you are currently looking at buying from. Sometimes they&#039;ll reply, sometimes not. if there is a response, use your judgment to think if they are legit or not!<br />C) Check out the forums thread and the feedback on the product your looking at. Sometimes people will write experiences, or simply put 5 out 5 ( good) or less 2 out of 5 ( not recommended)<br />Hope this helped a bit<br />Regards <br />Shades

				Shades - <br /><br />You&#039;ve only posted 3 times on the forums.&nbsp; How am I to trust YOUR &quot;bit of advice.&quot; ?&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s gotta be more precautionary measures one should take, I would think.&nbsp; I&#039;m entirely new to this - it is an exciting prospect but I&#039;m just a wee bit skeptical/hesitant to go to prison (paranoid)

				Yeah, makes sense.&nbsp; Still doesn&#039;t penetrate the sense that you never now who is on the other end of that wire.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t personally met anyone that has used this method of business...So it&#039;s hard to trust something that almost seems too good to be true.<br /><br />Thanks guys
