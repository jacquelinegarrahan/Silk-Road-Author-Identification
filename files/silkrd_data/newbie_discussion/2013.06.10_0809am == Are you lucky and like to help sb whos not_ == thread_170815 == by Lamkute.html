				Hey Guys, this is going to be sth. that will annoy most of you...because i will ask for tiny donations. I don´t think sb. will be so crazy but who knows...<br /><br />I´m an addicted Person. The bad thing is that i´m not addicted to Drugs...I´m addicted to Gambling....i thought i would have sorted this thing out last year thru a therapy...<br />Bitcoin and the Road helped me to get my mind free again because i could get what i want when i want and so i didn´t want to gamble or anything anymore...<br />Btw i never gambled because i like it or on a daily basis...i only did when i needed money asap...stupid i know...<br />Tonight a friend told me about SSatoshis Circle....he played and doubled 5 Coins in 5minutes... So i got home and thought...ok...you saved about 15 coins in the last half year...maybe i can make 30% and stop it :) But...i completely fucked up....i won...raised the bid...lost...became angry and tryed to get it back....lost 6 times in a row and now ALL my coins are gone because of my stupid Idea... Damn...i believe in KArma and these things...and i really didn´t think that this would happen to me....<br />If somebody feels with me and maybe likes to give me a small donation to start trading again i would be really thankfull! And of Course everything will be notices and payed back in at least 4 Weeks...<br /><br />Lamkute <br />1LuJHM3wWEU6eiWzzpjGdeEeN62xfWGDAe <br /><br />Edit: If you will help me out you will once see that it was a good Idea! If i am in better Times of Life i will give a lot to this Community! Because normally i prefer to give and endjoy life together...but exactly this has started to bring me where i am now. I wish i would have found the Road a year before than i wouldn´t have burn´t so much money for real life drugs and would not have started to Gamble ever...<br />

				If you weren&#039;t using so much shorthand that I did not understand 70% of what the fuck you were trying to say, you may get more help.<br /><br />This is not twitter, you can type out entire words.

				If you really want (or need) to continue gambling, put in the time, effort and dedication to play poker proficiently, and then eschew all other forms of gambling. The house always wins in the long run.

				I don´t want to gamble any more. I never did it for fun on a daily basis. It have been short times where i really needed money as soon as possible. Now i want to make some due to resell some stuff from the road because i see that this is much more smart and i got the people who i can sell to without much risk...
