				Hello SR!<br /><br />So i had the intention to sell some Weed on this Site, but i would like to know some Tips on how to sell it! For some reason my Forum search doesnt work, so i couldnt really search for this topic, so please dont come down on me.<br /><br />I wanted to know the general way of how the People on this Forum ( Mainly sellers ) handle their Bitcoins and make real $$$ out of them?<br /><br />My plan so far was, once i get BTC i would trade them in for real Gold on http://www.coinabul.com/ for example and send that Gold to a &quot;fake&quot; address.. i mean that would be the ultimate safest way of turning BTC into real cash right?<br /><br />Is there any other way? I mean all the bitcoin cash you send to your Bank account could be visible to law enforcement no? And all paypal accs etc...<br /><br /><br />So how do you guys turn your BTC safely into real cash? Whats the best way?<br /><br /><br />Also is http://www.coinabul.com/ reliable and have you guys been using it?

				Sounds like you and I have some similar questions. I can tell you this about the &quot;Your last search was less than 5 seconds ago. Please try again later.&quot; message, though. First, you do have to wait a minute or so before posting a second message. Secondly, if you have waited that 30 seconds or minute, then just refresh the page. The same thing happens to me, and if I just refresh that seems to fix it. Good luck on the rest. It is quite a project to take on to learn all of this stuff, huh?

				definitely a project. there should be a certificate. <br /><br />somehow i don&#039;t think big vendors are going to give up their methods for turning large amounts of btc into cash. i might be wrong. <br /><br />have u tried the bitcoin talk forum? prob more info on there. dunno about the buying gold bit though. make sure you search long and hard about any site before you send them your btc. plenty of scams out there.

				Yup, i did some research on some Sites already namely http://www.coinabul.com/. It doesnt seem to be a scam tho, but basicly the guy that is operating the Site is buying the stuff locally and then selling it for a higher BTC price, thus making Money. People were complaining that it took him almost a Year to send the gold coins.<br /><br />But what i found out was a legit site named amagimetals.com, who was selling their Gold for bitcoins, and had a very good reputation. However they got their Bank account seized by the Feds awhile ago just because they accepted BTC!<br /><br /><br />And here comes my main point. You need a way to transfer BTC into real cash that is 100% safe EVEN if the Feds know what you are doing! Thats what i would call a master strategy. And trading BTC into Gold is pretty much that. <br /><br />You could let the gold send to some anonymous address that doesnt even have to be linked with your real address and name. After you have it, theres NO way they can trace it back. Litterly. None.<br /><br />But it seems like the Feds know this thus cracking down on those Trades. The other options you have, by simply trading in BTC on some site such as MtGox will appear on your Bank account, and once there are Large sums coming up - boom you get busted.<br /><br /><br />I also had another idea awhile ago by basicly having an off shore anonymous bank account on the Caymans for example, wich is linked to a Credit card. And all your Money would be on this CC. But i cant really tell how this is working, since i never researched it. I heared this is used by Poker players to hide their winnings from the Goverment ( in some countries its forbidden to play online poker )<br /><br /><br />Any other ideas what you can do? Maybe turn BTC into paysafe cards and let them send to you? Like im not looking to make thousands of $$$ selling stuff on here, just like a couple hundred dollars MAX in a month. I dont have any intend to become a Big seller <br /><br /><br />Edit: Decent post im currently reading - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.15

				Push, still unanswered. Im beginning to think that the people here are afraid of sharing their Techniques. Thats ok! I dont want anyone to spoiler their techniques and thus making them useless. What i wanna know is a formular that even when the Feds KNOW how you do it they cant trace you back or prevent you from doing it. Thats what i though why they closed down this gold supplier because he accepted bitcoins.<br /><br /><br />However i found out they accept bitcoins again, so idk what the fuzz was all about. I still think they are keeping a very close eye on that company and are probably able to check the people that bought gold for bitcoins on their site.. But i mean you can just send the Gold to a fake address and treat it like it were drugs..

				My advice is to read the silk road wikia top to bottom: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Become extremely familiar with how tor works and how bitcoins works. These tools on anonymity are not powered by fairy dust and to know their inner technical workings allows your to bypass their security limitations and retain anonymity.<br /><br />Also several vendors offer bitcoin to cash options in the money section of the site: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/98<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t trust them with a real address though, maybe get a P.O. box in another name. There is undoubtably better ways to do it and you just have to discover them.

				Thanks, i havent come across that wiki site yet!<br /><br />I wonder tho, i saw that you have to pay for a vendor account.. now how is it possible to get BTC without purchasing them through a bank account? Isnt that a big security issue aswell for sellers? I mean it seems to be a substantial amount, wich im willing to pay as a seller, the question is how you would get those BTC anonymously..<br /><br /><br />Nvm scratch that.. there seems to be a Ton of sites that would give out BTC for Cash by mail..

				What are your guys opinions on Neteller Credit Cards? Those could potentially be very handy aswell or? You can transfer money on that netteller Card and then use it on a ATM or whatever..But idk if its safe to use with your actual name
