				<br />People are losing faith in traditional banking systems. Look at Cyprus and what&#039;s going on around the world. Please share you opinions on you best estimate for Bitcoin prices relative to the US Dollar by year&#039;s end.<br /><br />This is all opinion folks!

True, but the difficulty rate will go up and therefore make their purchase less sensible.<br />2. The value of bitcoins is based on fiduciary trust. I&#039;m not sure I agree with the volume/value argument you present.<br />3. Yes, but that time will be around 2050 I believe. When all blocks have been mined at that time, I believe a new crypto-currency will have replaced bitcoins<br />4. I agree that many people are holding out for a big payday. But that doesn&#039;t mean they will all sell at the same time. Less some event that shakes people&#039;s trust in bitcoins I don&#039;t really see a collapse due to volume being sold. Right now there are more people buying than selling which is one reason why the price keeps going up!<br /><br />Again, these are just my opinions but thank you for your input!

				if i remember correctly, about two years ago coins were around 40$, then I recall a story of a guy who had just been massively generating them and hoarding them, when he cashed out it literally crashed the market, i remember buying coins at .89 cents a pop after that, i think a similar thing will happen again, there is a lot more attention to them now though, making them more expensive but at the same time diluting the illicit e-money market.<br /><br />Dr K

				the reason i say the people hoarding the coins will sell at the same time is the sheer fact that theres an auto sell feature if the value drops to a certain point and the autosell feature kicks in on a massive group of investors it could very well bottom the market out. Not to say it wont be bought back up to a stable dollar value.I guess the same could be said for the auto buy feature as well. The market is young and we will just have to wait and see what it does.<br />On the lighter side of things BTC is worth a hell of a lot more then a usd not that i trust the us currency anyways whats our debt @now 20 trillion :)

				<br />@DrKilo23: I thought the crash two years ago was due to some massive theft from a reputable exchange. Maybe it was Bitfloor that got hacked, I can&#039;t recall entirely. Security is always an issue when there&#039;s such a financial incentive for hackers to steal a crypto-currency such a Bitcoins.<br /><br />@sh1nra: Yes, you&#039;re referring to limit orders and I do believe that a percentage of Bitcoin users keep their coins in their market accounts for this purpose. If the value suddenly starts to drop, they have set limits at where they will look to sell so as to limit their losses. On the other hand, there are surely just as many if not more people with buy orders on ready for when their value drops below a certain criteria.<br /><br />From my point of view, it seems that since there&#039;s so much financial instability in global markets Bitcoins seem like a sure-fire way to go. There&#039;s no central authority to take away their money and unlike paper currencies, more of it cannot be printed, leading to inflation. There are a LOT of people who believe this is a bubble waiting to burst. On the other hand there are a lot of people putting their entire life savings into Bitcoins and betting on their success. <br /><br />I believe that minus some sort of catastrophic event which shakes people&#039;s trust in Bitcoins their value will simply keep going up. As more media attention is drawn to the currency more and more people will want to get their hands on some. Merchants are starting to notice and I suspect many more will begin accepting Bitcoins instead of traditional currencies.<br /><br />Thank you for your input! It&#039;s well received and appreciated!

				If it was sitting at 500 at the end of the year, I wouldn&#039;t be shocked, but I&#039;ll bet there&#039;s a major correction sometime in the next few months (maybe still lots of rise before that), and then some flatter prices until people forget the uncertaintly again and a new bubble takes off.<br /><br />Or it could be $27 tomorrow...<br /><br />Or the Oligarchy could figure out how to shut it down and it will be a historical footnote...

It is a little over an hour long but these economists go about saying how more people will lose coins to forgotten addresses (and never be able to recover them) and how those coins going out of circulation will essentially bring the currency down. Forgot when that&#039;s going to happen but it&#039;s some distance future modeling they projected.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good one to watch, although pretty boring, so spark one up and listen to what they have to say.

I&#039;ve read stories where certain hedge funds with near impossibly high rates of return were suspected of being early adopters of Bitcoins and started cashing in bigtime. I can&#039;t say whether I believe that or not but I&#039;m trying to figure out how the media could possibly know that the rich are holding onto a stockpile of Bitcoins.<br /><br />The rich are already secretive enough with their investments and money to begin with. They don&#039;t want the IRS to see it or anyone else for that matter because of personal liability. If I were rich and told people about all the Bitcoins I had, I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a far stretch to say they would have a target on their backs for kiddnapping/extorsion. They would have to imagine the possibility of someone holding them at gunpoint demanding they transfer funds to an address of their choice. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me being paranoid from so many years of smoking but this is sort of how I think nowadays and I believe the rich who have more to lose would also think along these lines. They wouldn&#039;t want anyone to know about their Bitcoins so I question how accurate that theory is.<br /><br />Just my $.02<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s going to rapidly increase like it has in the past month. But I also see it crashing sometime soon once investors decide they&#039;ve made a decent amount of money. I don&#039;t see it staying anywhere near the several hundreds of dollars worth, especially considering that it has very little use other than investing (and SR). Probably will balance out at around $100 by the time the year is over.

				I base this prediction purely on supply and demand....<br />&nbsp;The good press this topic has had over the last few weeks will see the price of BTC continue it&#039;s upward trajectory.&nbsp; <br />We&#039;ve all got used to the whole concept of BTC and it&#039;s easy to forget that we are actually witnessing the birth and baby steps of what seems to be a bullet proof, equitable and well thought out future currency. ... Talk to your average accountant or any old non silkroad user on the street and you will find that 99 percent of them don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about. The elements of organised crime that are already using btc are also &quot;early adopters&quot;. Soon, everyone from your local bikie gang to your &quot;mum and dad&quot; investor will be researching the mighty bitcoin and this interest alone will help push up the price.... <br />After these &quot;investors&quot; have done their homework and, like us,&nbsp; see very few flaws in the system,&nbsp; some of them will invest. Even if just a small portion of these people invest in BTC, it&#039;s still going to be a huge amount of investors compared to those that are already involved and the price of coins will soar.

				I think 2013 is too short a time frame to say it will go up. I &quot;predict&quot; that there will be a crash sometime this year - perhaps when a large investor decides to cash out and that causes a slight dip, triggering a panic in other investors to cash out before it drops more. I mean, some people have hundreds of thousands to millions tied up in BTC. They aren&#039;t going to pull out at the first sign of trouble, unless they fundamentally believe in the long term stability of the system.<br /><br />I for one don&#039;t know enough about the technology to trust it. For one, the block-chain split bug that occured a week or so ago has me thinking that with enough people on board, there could become 2 bitcoin block chains which would dilute the value of both chains. Each side saying they are the &quot;real&quot; chain and then we have 2 digital currencies with different values.<br /><br />In addition, if we break the heat/power wall in computer engineering and come up with some way to drastically increase computation power, that might all the sudden kill btc value as all the sudden miners will be mining at relatively brisk speeds until the exponential increase in difficulty causes the next power wall to get hit.<br /><br />My real prediction is long term. There will always be black markets. If BTC holds up, it will be worth over $1k per BTC. That probably won&#039;t happen for another 5-50 years, though.

Talk to your average accountant or any old non silkroad user on the street and you will find that 99 percent of them don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about. The elements of organised crime that are already using btc are also &quot;early adopters&quot;. Soon, everyone from your local bikie gang to your &quot;mum and dad&quot; investor will be researching the mighty bitcoin and this interest alone will help push up the price.... <br />After these &quot;investors&quot; have done their homework and, like us,&nbsp; see very few flaws in the system,&nbsp; some of them will invest. Even if just a small portion of these people invest in BTC, it&#039;s still going to be a huge amount of investors compared to those that are already involved and the price of coins will soar.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with a lot of what you&#039;re saying here. I do think that a continued interest in the currency will drive up it&#039;s price. However there are limitations to Bitcoins that I just recently began researching.<br /><br />Have you watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpvQmF2AgG8<br /><br />They present a lot of interesting points regarding Bitcoins and its definitely worth a look.<br />

				The current bitcoin price seem inflated, to me. Lots of people are buying it up as a storage-of-wealth system like with gold and such hording will artificially inflate the price of the coins that remain in circulation. But should the hoarded coins be dumped back into the market the price will drop, and should a large amount of coins be dumped into the market all at once it may trigger other people to believe the &quot;bubble has burst&quot;, wherein they will dump their own coins and cause that bubble to burst, wherein we will end up with bitcoins having much less value.<br /><br />So personally, I expect the price to drop to around what it used to be before this mega-inflation(technically deflation) happened. But hey, I&#039;ve been expecting that every single day for the last two weeks and it hasn&#039;t happened yet... Which is no reason to think it won&#039;t.

				Just like Gold, when the big players start profit taking,&nbsp; sell off their stash of coins, their should be a decrease in the value of&nbsp; a Bitcoin, but I wouldn&#039;t even begin to predict that this will bring prices back to $12 a coin. I would expect with the popularity of the Bitcoin rising that he value of the Bitcoin is naturally going to rise with it.

				Maybe the better poll would be to ask at what price do you think we&#039;ll hit the bottom wall? I don&#039;t believe Bitcoins are going out.

				Wow, all markets are going WILD right now. I believe this is due to;<br /><br />A. Whoever sold 5,000BTC at $260USD today is at least partially responsible for setting off SELL limit orders and now we&#039;re seeing the results.<br />B. MTgox grew too fast and became too unstable with all the transactions and traffic it handles. This was made worse by the auto sell orders. Also the lag/delay in their bid/ask prices didn&#039;t help the situation one bit.<br />C. Panic and panic selling due to most people not truly understanding what Bitcoins are. They see their money disappearing and they sell to mitigate potential losses.<br /><br />Add all three of these and you have a Wednesday like today! :)<br /><br />I do NOT believe it will crash down to $5USD as many are claiming. I think it will go through a few more swings before it stabilizes again. I hope that at the very least Bitcoin equity is more evenly spread after today. Few investors with a LOT of coins is no good. <br /><br />I will say that after today, confidence in MTgox will be at an all time low!<br /><br />I predict that people will come home after work today, look at their Bitcoins and go, &quot;WTF!? I&#039;m getting out of this craziness!&quot; MORE Price Swings Coming folks..<br /><br /><br />-CC<br /><br />
