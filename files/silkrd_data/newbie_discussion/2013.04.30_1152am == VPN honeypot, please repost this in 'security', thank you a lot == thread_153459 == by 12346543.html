				hello, i urge someone to repost this in the security thread as i made a new account for this.<br /><br />each time I connect to a &#039;privateinternetaccess.com&#039; vpn server in France, my apparent IP is located in the United States, Virginia. 37.59.34.218 is the IP address.<br />The IP was reported as a honeypot in th &quot;projecthoneypot&quot; database.<br />This is highly disturbing and I would appreciate a statement from someone. Is this a clue that my system is compromised or is what are some other ideas? if i connect to a vpn server in another country from privateinternetaccess.com, the ip seems to be fine. I only get this connecting to their server in france.<br /><br />Thank you very much for your answers<br />

				I am also using Private Internet Access, they are probably the best VPN out there.<br /><br />Sometimse when I post on 4chan, it says &quot;You are Banned&quot; and it says why, but it is because someone else was using the same IP in order to spam or whatever. Kind of sucks, I hope they add more IPs, because a lot of jack asses are using them for bad things and ruining the whole IP for anyone who uses it after them.<br /><br />Fuckers are burning the bridges.

				but connecting to their server in france and then finding out my ip belongs to a server in the USA and is listed as a honeypot is quite disturbing.<br />whatsmyipaddress shows the IP to be in the USA, butwhen i click on the &quot;additional ip details&quot; button it shows to be in france as expected.
