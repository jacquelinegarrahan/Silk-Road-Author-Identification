				I can&#039;t post in rumormill because I don&#039;t have 50 posts. Please post this thread in rumormill for me<br /><br /><br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM LUCYDROP ON SR<br /><br />I can&#039;t talk about specifics for security reasons, but i was in jail for more than 2 months but less than 7. I got released very recently. LucyDrop on SilkRoad is NOT ME. DO NOT BUY FROM THAT ACCOUNT. My partner completely fucked me over. I went to our spot.. there is nothing there and he wont answer my phone calls. He took the work computer and everything else. He took my entire savings with him that was being used to keep supply up. He took my entire life. Somebody PLEASE get in contact with DPR or Vendor Support and have the account shut down immediately and freeze all the funds in the account.<br /><br />How can I contact DPR? I can&#039;t find a link to message him. I can prove to him that I am the real lucydrop as I do not have access to my pgp or any of my logins.<br /><br />If you ordered from me in the past (namely a couple of top vendors, i can give you details and you can verify/vouch that I am indeed the real LucyDrop)<br /><br />Do not trust anything that is said from that LucyDrop account! Do not send ANY FUNDS. Do NOT FINALIZE ANYTHING.<br /><br />Somebody please get DPR to see this thread. Someone please post this in Rumor mill. My entire life was taken from me and I don&#039;t know what to do

				Tess: I don&#039;t have access to my PGP or any account. I don&#039;t have access to the work computer. He took everything and skipped.<br /><br />To the person suggesting that I am attempting a re-entry: I am trying to get the account shut down, not regain access to continue selling. He is still making sales and people are still finalizing for him. He took everything I own. What would I have to gain from trying to get that account shut down if it was mine and still generating sales and people were still finalizing? <br /><br />You guys know me. Did I ever seem like I was that type of guy? I have put a lot of work spreading this chemical around, and now for everything I have done, I have lost everything because I was stupid and thought I could trust someone who I invited into my home.. to meet my family.. and to do business with. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like disclosing who I talk to and whatnot, but I regularly talked to Nevita. Great human being and great vendor. Before any of this bullshit happened with the weak tabs and this scam bullshit I had told Nevita that my partner was acting strange and that I believed money and greed was getting to his head. This was all before any of this stuff happened. I hope one of you can get his eyes on this thread, and hopefully he can at least vouch for that. I considered/consider him one of my true friends on SilkRoad.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know what to do now. I&#039;m so lost and I feel responsible for not acting on my feelings of my partner acting weird when we started getting popular on SR. I don&#039;t know if he reported me to the police for my warrants for previous charges, but I would not put it past him to use that opportunity to take my life from me.<br /><br />What I am first trying to do is get the account shut down and all funds frozen. I completely understand if people hate me, because they have every right to. I should never trusted bringing a partner in. Truth was that it was too overwhelming for 1 person to handle and I truly believed I could trust him. I will do everything in my power to make this right, but at this moment I do not even know what i am going to do. I will no longer be vending because I have lost my faith in humanity.<br />

				this is fascinating for me as a long time shroom hunter. I learned the same thing many years ago, you can&#039;t partner with anyone. You can&#039;t tell anyone where your secret spots are, you gotta do the whole thing by yourself, If it gets too much, you either raise prices to slow it down, or shut it down till you can handle it again<br /><br />Over the years I learned how far people will go to try and find my secret mushrooms spots. That taught me how to really keep my mouth shut and really be a lone hunter and how to keep secrets. There is no other way. You either keep your spots secret or you kiss it goodbye because they will be raped every time, even by your so called friends<br /><br /><br />That taught me a lot about so called friends, and a good analagy would be movies like Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the gold rush in California where everyone is your friend until the gold is discovered. It&#039;s an age old problem and not restricted to drugs. It happens everywhere<br /><br /><br />There is one good thing tho. Unlike manufactured drugs like LSD, wild magic mushrooms do not depend on partners, friends to get it made. the best wild shrooms only depends on keeping your spots secret and Mother Nature does the rest. So basically the supply chain cannot be shut down by anyone. The only question is who will find it<br /><br />it&#039;s a bit similar to SR itself and other deep web market places. It depends on secrecy. As long as they can&#039;t find DPR or whatever it&#039;ll stay. As long as I keep my spots secret and nobody else finds it, it&#039;s fine. And the great thing about it, with mushrooms it keeps changing locations and spreading via spores, so even if some spots get found, new ones appear somewhere else, so it is literally impossible to stop. They might be able to stop me, but they can&#039;t stop IT

				To the people thinking this is all part of a big plan... What about the people who did receive reships? Like someone I think yesterday or the day before said they received a reship. If this was the plan, why bother sending that reship at all? The only motivation I can think of would be to keep FE orders coming in today... <br /><br />Not saying anything either way, just thinking out loud.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t see LD giving everyone&#039;s money back to the people that got scammed. If the story is a lie, then obviously this will not be the case. If it&#039;s true, then clearly this person is in no condition to give out a hundred grand.<br /><br />I hope this story is true and that somehow LD gets back on their feet and starts selling again.

				If this is true, I can&#039;t see RLD being able to compensate everyone.&nbsp; Maybe in a long time, if he were able to get himself reestablished, he could afford some tabs to send out to all those affected.&nbsp; However, that&#039;s looking quite a bit down the road and if this person is going to go so far as to send out reships for those affected months and months after the fact, I imagine they would take the time to read through the forums at least and find a way at least those people.<br /><br />There&#039;s something about this that just feels off though...&nbsp; If nevita comes in and confirms their previous conversations, that at least makes this interesting but doesn&#039;t eliminate the possibility that RLD and LD are still the same person and always have been.&nbsp; Even if RLD comes out with the same LSD and gets back to regular business, I just can&#039;t see people trusting it unless the FE requirement is completely eliminated.

				This is one of the many problems of having anonymous sellers. Who&#039;s to say one of these days a serial killer (a previous trusted seller) won&#039;t start slipping in cyanide with his shipments?!?

				Hell of a story. <br /><br />Looks and &quot;sounds&quot; like same person as lucydrop, i kept all our messages and he sure seems the same. Always got a story and kept me on the line since January 12. Placed 3 orders. Got 1 of 3. It was totally inactive all 25. Then he promised reship of all 3 orders and i waited nothing after 4 weeks. I then noticed his thread claiming to make good. <br /><br />I messaged him again he claims (1 week ago now) he would express them all to me. <br /><br />Shockingly i didn&#039;t get them :) its ok tho I&#039;m a big boy, karma is real and she&#039;s a fan of assrape so eventually things will balance.

				The whole story is ridiculous. For example - the fact that RLD can remember conversations with Nevita or even told him he thought his partner was getting weird in no way proves anything, because if LD was planning a scam that&#039;s exactly what he would do.<br /><br />About Tess - the reason people think Tess is the same person&nbsp; is because LD was preceded by at least two other Canadian scammers with very similar MOs&nbsp; (good product, good track record, no FE, finally started asking for FE and scammed hundreds of people).&nbsp; this was the story with TOny76 and before that with whatshisname - NSC or something like that. <br /><br />You have to understand that for these long-term pro scammers, the scam is kind of a game, and they probably don&#039;t go into it with a clear plan - they pretty much improvise and make stuff up as they go along. And presumably they see it as a challenge to think of how much bullshit they can get people to swallow. They also try to adopt a specific persona each time. So LD was the earnest, well-intentioned acid guru, whereas Tony76 was this streetwise, slightly dumb polydrug vendor who happened to end up specializing in selling acid. But anybody who&#039;s got a background in online role playing games (ie pretty much every hacker on the planet) knows how to do that.<br /><br />None of this proves that Tess is the same person. It does prove that if Tess starts asking for FE then they should be boycotted immediately, because none of these scammers started out asking for FE.<br /><br />People should also keep in mind that there have been big acid scams which even included vendors who used escrow. What they did was publicly use escrow and use it for everyone who&#039;s active in the forums but then don&#039;t end up asking dozens of people who only use the market to FE, and also to string out the finalization period for people in escrow by sending out product really late and then sending people NBome in the hope that a few dumbasses would post positive reviews because they kind of tripped a little and thereby pressure everyone else to finalize who hadn&#039;t tried it yet. These guys really play on the fact that a lot of people don&#039;t have a chance to try the acid as soon as it arrives but feel under some pressure to finalize as soon as they receive. That&#039;s why the avengers have been so important. They&#039;re not that reliable about dosage and acid quality but at least they let people know if the product they&#039;re receiving actually has some LSD on it and is the vaguely right ballpark when it comes to dosage.<br /><br />Solution. Do Not FE. Do not even finalize for LSD without sampling it unless a large number of reviews plus the avengers have said that it is good acid.

				I ordered from Tess and had no issues,&nbsp; no asking to FE,&nbsp; no hassle, great product, great stealth.<br /><br />That logic I hear would lead you to think any vendor is THAT vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like it was just said,&nbsp; the problem is the FE,&nbsp; that should be a very limited option and should not be allowed and or monitored.<br /><br />I look at it like this,&nbsp; SR is DPR&#039;s baby,&nbsp; his/her project and vision,&nbsp; so I do not get how a Lucy scam went on as long as it has.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes there is a report vendor button, and you know it was used,&nbsp; but this was bigger then that, has been bigger then that, for a long time, and has been allowed to continue.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And why?&nbsp; &nbsp;DPR and all the founding members are smarter then me, smarter then most.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a dropped ball and should be addressed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes scout, it has to be investigated I know they have to take steps, but to allow that account to accept orders still, there is no logical reason for that.<br /><br />Also, SR did make a cut off a huge amount of money, even if it was 1% that is 1% of a lie.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am no math whiz, but it has to be several thousand dollars.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now should that money be given back to people that continued to FE?&nbsp; No, that was a live and learn mistake, and a fool and his money are easily separated.&nbsp; &nbsp;However,&nbsp; make it public what the cut was, and use that for something good,&nbsp; like some measure to prevent this kind of thing from happening again,&nbsp; give someone on the board of directors a pay increase who&#039;s one and only job is to monitor huge red flag FE situations like this Lucy circus?&nbsp; &nbsp; Work with me here,&nbsp; something.... something,&nbsp; do not just damage the integrity of the DPR name or SR for that matter by saying and doing nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This brings a end to my thoughts I apologize if they didn&#039;t flow in a easy to read fashion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To sum it up.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DPR address this, it seems to be over,&nbsp; but restore some faith that you can keep this from happening again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wasn&#039;t it multiple thousands?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And&nbsp; Tess has done nothing to deserve a finger pointed at him,&nbsp; so come on people, until someone gives you a reason to doubt them, don&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The end.

				I hope you get things sorted out, your lsd is incredible. I ordered some just a little over 2 months ago so I`m not sure if it was from you or your asshole of a partner. Its arrived and they were not weak tabs so I assume I got some of the last good ones before he went rogue. I`m glad I didn`t order anymore, but I would definately return to you as a customer when things get sorted out bro. I hope you find him.

				i came to SR when this was just starting to unfold and it has been a complete drama.&nbsp; A buddy of mine ordered from LD months ago and of the current weaker batch. I&nbsp; also got to sample these and the weaker batch. There was just a huge discrep in dosage between hits like the laying wasnt done correctly. (like two different people had laid each batch) well long story short he was offered a reship for his February purchase&nbsp; &nbsp;and still no signs of making good on that promise.&nbsp; This really sucks alot of people have been screwed but the escrow system is there to protect you. i can see finalizing on a order that has arrived before testing but why before the package ever comes.&nbsp; would you send that Nigerian prince the money he asked for in the highly personalized letter addressed to you too.&nbsp; If so i have a business opportunity for YOU. i accept BTC

				I want to address a couple things. <br />Some people seem to think I am Tesselated, so let me set something straight<br />Do NOT FE for Tesselated. Never. Do not finalize early for ANY vendor.<br />This really makes me sick. Not only did this piece of shit do all this damage to me and the buyers. He has hurt the LSD movement as a whole. Now other vendors are going to affected by this. The buyers won&#039;t be willing to buy LSD.

				Well don&#039;t I just feel like a complete retard.<br /><br />I saw that &quot;Lucy&quot; was doing reships to &quot;everyone who got her weak acid&quot; and like an idiot, after getting an order after one week from tesselated, (which I can confirm is NOT lucy just because of his stealth) I ordered from her and f/e&#039;d for a 50 tab...&nbsp; 250 dollars right down the toilet.&nbsp; So I actually thought I was getting a reship as well so I patiently have been waiting these past three weeks thinking I was going to be set all the way to summer.&nbsp; ...fuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will say in defense of what I thought was a decent intellect that I had ordered 3 times from her previously and received my order within a week each time.&nbsp; I was bolstered by stories of people receiving reships and it seemed things were taking a turn for the better, now I log in a week later and see this.&nbsp; Fuckin fantastic.&nbsp; Tesselated is legit, order from him.

				Idk about that being truth.&nbsp; &nbsp;The job is to match a buyer and seller?&nbsp; &nbsp; A legit seller maybe.&nbsp; &nbsp;But not to turn a blind eye and continuing to match people up with a rogue seller?<br /><br />The real truth is people should not FE.<br /><br />FE should not be allowed to rage unchecked when red flags pop up, or at all.<br /><br />And SR admin dropped the ball on this, as did everyone who FE.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blame is somewhere around 50/50.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If I ran a store that I built from the ground up, hired employee&#039;s who suddenly started ripping people off,&nbsp; well that would look bad on who?&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; &nbsp;And who should have been on top of that?&nbsp; Me.<br /><br />Plenty of blame to go around I suppose.

				And people have a chance to let SR do their job is they stay in escrow. If you do not stay in escrow, their job cant be done.<br /><br />Often times FE offers are &quot;act now&quot; ... &quot;must move quick&quot; deals ... and SR doesnt have their finger on the pulse of every little thing ... but I know they have hired 2 new employees ( which is NOT easy when running the most sought after takedown of any drug police ) recently and I am sure when they grow a little bigger DPR will get another one and another one.<br /><br />You must give the free market space to breathe

				I&#039;m new to SR but not new to drugs or druggies. RDL sounds like a scammer, wouldn&#039;t trust him/her with a single BTC. Who would share their account and password etc? It&#039;s not hard paying someone to post, pack etc while keeping the majority info to yourself. Stick to the solid sellers and keep orders smallish unless you can afford to take a chance, that way it&#039;s not a biggie if you get burned. <br />He/she, sent out some reorders just to give people hope and keep the money rolling in, now has realized that there is no going back so made this weak excuse up. Steer clear!

				Wow, this is an interesting development.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure the LD account is suspended, no?<br /><br />Your bastard partner took about $100/whatever BTC it was worth at the time (beginning of Feb) from me. If it could be returned that would be awesome. It was JUST before it started coming out that he was a scammer that I decided to make a purchase.<br /><br />That&#039;s really fucked, man.

				&nbsp;I believe that RLD and LD are the same people. I find it hard to believe his story.&nbsp; He is glib now, but he WOULD be if LD and RLD are the same people anyway. And for RLD to expect anybody to believe that story (without a HELL of a lot more proof) is almost as insulting as the scam itself. <br />This is going to continue. What are some ways to stop scammers from doing the same thing, over and over and over.....?<br />Maybe some kind of deposit with SR. Maybe it could be collected as the dealer sells product, a 5% charge? And it should be harder for customers to FE. <br />I promised to FE on one order, I hope that works out <br />I don&#039;t blame SR at all. <br />If you&#039;re a dealer, you should be able to afford a (eventually returned) deposit. <br />I looked at stats for dealers on SR, which seemed great, and then have come to the forums and found that they&#039;re were all kind of complaints. I haven&#039;t seen any &#039;scammer&#039; 1/5 on SR for reviews. Does the bulk of the orders cover that up, or what?<br />The dealers should get their heads together (along with the customers) and figure out a &#039;Best Practices&#039; guideline. I know, don&#039;t FE. <br />Whether or not my order works out, I&#039;m not going to FE anymore.

				I&#039;d like to address a couple of things that people have asked me, or that have come up in this discussion<br /><br />1.) Will I ever vend again? No. I do not have the means to vend again, and even if I did i wouldn&#039;t. I put a lot of work and effort into this, and I have nothing to show for it except a ton of people who were hurt because of the actions of my rogue partner.<br /><br />2.) What will be done about this whole fiasco? I have been in contact with DPR and I can not really discuss what has been discussed, but I&#039;m helping him make sure this doesn&#039;t happen again<br /><br />3.) Am I tesselatated? Was this an exit strategy and will I shop up under a different name? No. I don&#039;t know how I can prove this but I will tell you a couple things that maybe will make you feel more confident that I am done with this place (vending - not the community - because the LSD community here are some of the warmest kindest people I have met)<br /><br />Do not FE for ANYBODY. Do not FE for tesselated or ANYBODY. Be W EARY of ANYONE from my region trying sell LSD. My ex partner is a horrible human being, and I don&#039;t know if he will try and make another account to scam more. So NEVER FE for anyone, and ESPECIALLY never FE for anybody from this region.<br /><br />I wish I had more to say to you guys, or a way I could help the people who were caught in this mess. Truth is, I lost everything and I don&#039;t really know what I am going to do now.<br /><br />I appreciate the kind words people have PM&#039;d me and in this thread. I will still be active on the forums, but only as a escrow advocate and not a vendor.<br /><br />Thank you all for everything, and I&#039;m sorry it ended like this

				@RealLucyDrop: soooo, you&#039;re out of business. Great, now there is 0 chances to get refund/reship. Cool :/<br /><br />Is it worth to continue this thread? We lost money, we won&#039;t get it back, the &quot;RealLucyDrop&quot; has nothing valuable to say.

				The people going all nuts on this really upsets me, who cares if this is the real ld or not, our money is gone and its not coming back.<br /><br />If you think tessellated is ld, then you clearly have never tried tes`es product, and that shit about it was ld who crashed the forum, that has to be the simple most idiotic comment i have read in here<br /><br />Some people just wants the internet to go up in flames.<br /><br />RealLucyDrop, can we ask some questions about your business ? <br /><br />Where did the acid come from ?, why did you leave it all to someone you dont really know ? And what happened to the money you made before going to jail ?&nbsp; I hope its okay i am asking, LE cant really use any og this to anything and if you never gonna vend it shudent really matter <br /><br />

				Here is my take on this whole issue. <br /><br />To sum it up before you read the whole thing, my thoughts are that Lucydrop = RealLucyDrop = Tesselated<br /><br />There is a lot of money to be made from selling and scamming people with LSD. I believe that Lucydrop came into this knowing he would scam SR, in addition to planning a longer term kind of scam, and that&#039;s why they set up &#039;Tesselated&#039;, just in time to take over Lucydrop when everyone finally realized the huge scam they were pulling. <br /><br />I have read in this thread that people are saying that LD is not tesselated because of the shipping not being the same? No kidding people, if you were trying to change your identity, would you use the same characteristic markings that you used with your last identity? No, and I shouldn&#039;t even have to address that. <br /><br />Tesselated seems to be a fantastic seller with escrow being used all the time, but I am suspicious, because in the time I have been lurking SR, LSD has always been an expensive and more rare drug than any. In the time that Lucydrop came onto the scene and started selling and making everyone happy (for the record, I bought from Lucydrop and got a 10 strip of real LSD...), Tesselated, also a vendor with apparent large amounts of LSD to sell cheaply at his disposal, also shows up. <br /><br />This strikes me as slightly strange, and I am very suspicious of all vendors on SR now because of this large scam. <br /><br />To sum this up once again, DO NOT FE. EVER.&nbsp;

				Obviously the theory that Tony/LD/Tess are the same person is plausible, just like basically every theory is plausible on a totally anonymous marketplace. It doesn&#039;t seem likely to be the truth though, imho.<br /><br />If what you guys is saying is true, this is the most elaborate and wonderfully executed scam. But if it was, wouldn&#039;t it have been done a little better? (Unreal) LD could have done much more to reassure people, between the reship promises and the account being deleted. This would have led to quite a few more FEs, I believe. If LD was shipping those reships in an attempt to calm people down and increase FEs, why not be more reassuring on the forums? Why not send the most prestigious forum members THEIR acid? &#039;The Real LD turned up just as the scam became untenable&#039;... The scam appeared pretty untenable for quite a while before, and people were still FEing. If anything, it seems Real LD&#039;s appearance prompted the end of the scam, although I can&#039;t be sure about that.<br /><br />For a scam so incredibly elaborate, there seems to be a few pretty basic mistakes and oversights. The pieces don&#039;t fit. If anyone has quality answers to those questions, speak up - I love a good conspiracy. And the beauty of SR is that literally anything is possible, and we&#039;d never be able to actually know. Even if Tess ends up scamming (I have faith that this will not ever happen) and says &quot;I was Tony and Lucy!&quot; we still wouldn&#039;t know - they might have just decided to scam and said that for a laugh because everyone would believe it.<br /><br />The theory&#039;s definitely worth raising, but I don&#039;t get how people are so sure about anything on a place like this.

I don&#039;t believe it because it doesn&#039;t make sense and there&#039;s no evidence. Ah well, it&#039;s natural to see patterns in things when there aren&#039;t any. If anyone actually considered not ordering for Tess because of this, then&nbsp; the loss is theirs.

Because of this, there is a real danger that the Bitcoins being held in your escrow account will lose value by the time your vendor gets paid or you are refunded. So, we&#039;ve given the option to vendors to hedge the future payments they are expecting from escrow such that the dollar value of the payment doesn&#039;t change as the Bitcoin exchange rate changes.<br /><br />For example, a seller is hedging the escrow for a 10 btc order you place with them, and the dollar value of your order when you purchase it is $100. Now, let&#039;s say your order never arrives and your vendor agrees to a full refund, but those 10 btc are no longer worth $100, they&#039;re worth $50! Because your vendor hedged the escrow, you won&#039;t get a refund of 10 btc, you&#039;ll get 20 btc equaling the original value of $100. Of course, the opposite is also true. If Bitcoins appreciate in value while your order is in escrow, your refund will be fewer Bitcoins, but still equaling the original dollar value.<br /><br />When checking out, you will see which orders will be hedged and which won&#039;t. After the order is placed, your escrow balance will reflect the dollar value of your hedged orders and the Bitcoin value of your unhedged orders. All hedged orders are hedged as soon as the order is placed. So when getting a refund for hedged items, don&#039;t be surprised if the number of Bitcoins you get back is not the same as the amount you paid.<br /><br />If you need the most up-to-date USD/BTC exchange rate, we recommend mtgoxlive.com. &quot;<br /><br /><br />Depending on the vendor (and the fee they chose to pay) if will say hedged or unhedged next to the orders you&#039;ve placed.&nbsp;

				I bought a 10 strip from LD on 6th February just as all the shit started happening.<br /><br />FE&#039;d like everyone else and after reading all the negative postings I&#039;d given up hope of them coming. Then low and behold a couple of weeks ago they turned up out the blue.<br /><br />Why he would choose to fulfill my order and not others I don&#039;t know. I&#039;d been following his main thread but didn&#039;t post due to not being in the 50 (posts) club so it wasn&#039;t as if I&#039;d been vocal and he sent them to shut me up.<br /><br />Last night I took four. Have had shrooms and truffles about 15-20 times previously but this was my first proper LSD experience so had nothing to directly compare it to.<br /><br />They certainly worked but I was surprised as a first time user that I was seemingly able to take so many. Had an happy / altered mind state and that wasted / dopey feeling but visual wise only slight sparklies out the corners of my vision. <br /><br />Whether they were from the infamous weak batch or not I don&#039;t know because once again I&#039;ve got nothing to properly compare it to but it wasn&#039;t as near as intense as let&#039;s say two 7g sachets of magic truffles for instance.<br /><br />Feel a bit guilty coming on here and telling people I got mine when others didn&#039;t. But if it makes anyone feel better I&#039;ve got an FE order for a 1oz skunk for $60 from La Fuente that I ordered six weeks ago that&#039;s starting to look like its not coming. I&#039;d chosen unsigned for delivery which the vendor stated didn&#039;t come with a refund policy so looks like I might have to write that one off. Starting to think twice about FE&#039;ing in future as a result of these two experiences.

				I&#039;m not saying this is the case here, but it would be really clever (and an asshole move), for an established trusted vendor to all of a sudden fuck over his customers, require FE and not send out any orders (like that Tony guy last year), pocket the money, then come on here and claim his partner stole the account and is really the one who cheated everyone.&nbsp; then he can re-establish his account under a similar name like &quot;theREALvendor&quot; and win back all of the old customers whom he cheated, and continue to operate without having to start a brand new account.&nbsp; In effect he would have been able to steal a bunch of money from the cheated FE customers, and then continue on without losing his whole customer base.&nbsp; I know it would be a fucked up thing to do, but it just occurred to me.&nbsp; So keep this in mind before trusting a re-incarnated vendor.<br /><br />But who knows, this might never have happened.&nbsp; And I have no idea who LucyDrop is, so I&#039;m in no way suggesting that this is the case with LD.&nbsp; Just thought I should point out the possibility to everyone to keep in mind.

And another lesson to NEVER FINALIZE EARLY! <br /><br />Whether this is true or not I&#039;m really sorry to see so many people screwed over wanting some LSD. It&#039;s a shame some people can&#039;t be satisfied with reasonable profits on a good product without turning into greedy shitsacks.
