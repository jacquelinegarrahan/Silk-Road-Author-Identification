				So this was my first purchase on Silk Road. I shopped around, read the forums and reviews, and compared prices. In the end i opted for the Costello Group as their price was very competitive, they had a few good reviews, and their customer service seemed to be top-notch.<br /><br />I ordered 1g of &quot;Top Quality &#039;Blow Your Mind&#039; Dutch MDMA&quot; on Tuesday night, and it arrived on Saturday morning. The packaging and stealth was very clever. Looks like a legit business package from the outside and on the in. So far so good. I got to the product and was pleased to see that it was all nice large crystals. I had only ordered 1g, but the bag looked a lot fuller than that, so i popped it on the scales and was very pleased when it weighed in at 2.5g! At this point I tasted a tiny crystal. It tasted right, so I finalised payment.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t planning on using any until next weekend, but as there was more than double the amount expected, My girlfriend and I decided to give it a sample. For information, my girlfriend and I haven&#039;t used and class-A drugs in the last 6 weeks, and when we do use MDMA, we usually break 1g down in to 8x125mg gel caps, and take one each at 2 hour intervals (so a total of 4 in one night). If its good MDMA, we are usually pretty mashed on this amount. Anyway, as my girlfriend was due to work the next day, we decided to measure out a 150mg gel cap each, and have a 50mg gel cap each as a booster. The initial dose was more than we would usually have, so I was expecting good things.<br />8.30pm - We each swallow a gel cap containing 150mg of ground up MDMA crystal<br />9.30pm - Not feeling anything yet. Not overly concerned, as sometimes come-ups can take a bit longer.<br />10.30pm - Still not feeling anything, so decide to portion out 2 more 150mg gel caps.<br />11.30pm - beginning to feel something, but not much at all.<br />00.30am - Have had a very mild come-up that lasted for about 10 minutes. Really not what I would have expected from 300mg of mandy! Decide to portion out 2 more 150mg gel-caps.<br />2.30am - This mandy just never really got there. We were definitely on it, but no gurning, no jaw waggling,&nbsp; could definitely still see straight. Honestly, I think I could have still held a sensible conversation with my mum. Anyway, we decide to take the 50mg booster that was prepared at the start. To be honest, I didn&#039;t even notice it.<br />4.30am - Feeling like I&#039;m back to base-line now, so decide to crush up a small rock and snort it. Again, I feel some stimulant effect, but nothing major.<br />We sat up chatting until about 7am and then went to bed. Couldn&#039;t really sleep though. My girlfriend went to work at 1pm today, which normally after consuming half a gram of mandy would be near impossible. I haven;t felt any of the usual come-down body aches at all.<br /><br />In summary, It seems like the Costello Group are a great new vendor, who are really trying to establish themselves on silk road, by offering very competitive prices, quick delivery, excellent customer service, and very over weight products. However, in this instance the product has let them down. It was advertised that it would &quot;blow your mind&quot;, but I can assure you that my mind was definitely not blown. I had high hopes, as the MDMA from local dealers has been really shit recently, but unfortunately this product failed to live up to the hype.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Costello Group. You guys are definitely doing business in the right way, but at the end of the day its the product that I am buying, not all of the other bits. Let me know if you get a new, stronger, batch in. Cheers
