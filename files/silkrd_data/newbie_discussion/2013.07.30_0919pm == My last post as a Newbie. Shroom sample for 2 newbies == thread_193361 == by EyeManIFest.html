				That is an absolutely amazing deal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never bought something from a new vendor before, but look forward to trying your wares.&nbsp; I am brand new to Silk Road and SHOULD be getting my first order of a 1/4oz of Orissa India Cubensis in the mail on Friday.&nbsp; I spent the last several years purifying my body and mind and now I&#039;m definitely looking for my new fungus hook up.&nbsp; Now is the time&nbsp; ;D
