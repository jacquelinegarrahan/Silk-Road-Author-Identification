				Hello everyone, I have ran across the deep web and silk road a few weeks ago. I have been been looking on this forum and putting the pieces of the puzzle together. I think I have the shipping down perfectly and have ordered all of the things needed. The only thing I cannot figure out is how to setup a shipping account with USPS without having to give out my ssn info for a prepaid. I have also downloaded a Bitcoin wallet and would like to know what are the chances of getting it hacked? What is the most dangerous way for someone to hack it? Also the way I was going to receive payment for the bitcoins I make was to offer them to people for cheaper than value and have them send a wire transfer to a international bank take the money out and wire it to the States through another bank account. If someone has a better way please PM me and please help me figure out the problem of making a shipping account. Thank you all that respond.&nbsp;
