				Hey folks,<br />I&#039;m taking a trip in a few weeks, flying to Cancun, Mexico from Eastern US. I&#039;d like to take some MDMA with me (Mister M100, great stuff, check him out), but i&#039;m worried about airport security. Friends of mine have had success just mixing molly caps in with their supplements but that was always domestic flights. Does anyone have any experience? If so, was it carry on or checked luggage?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I think as long as you have your shit in your checked luggage, it will be fine. <br /><br />If it will be in your carry on, on your person youll want to disguise it some how. The way you mentioned works good.

				My buddy has a bag of different delicious candy, lollipops, tootsie rolls, SNICKERS ;), and a bag of pop rocks...what he does is remove all the pop rocks from the bag and put the MDMA in the bag&nbsp; and reseals it with a vacuum sealer&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But he only has done this domestically, IDK how good it will work with international flights..<br /><br />Hope this helps!&nbsp;

				I like the mail idea, you don&#039;t even have to send it from your house, but if your stay is long enough and you time it well you can order from SR and have it sent to your address in Mexico. <br /><br />Other than that id agree with sticking them in a vitamin pill bottle with your other stuff. <br /><br />Does anyone know what the charge for bringing a personal amount of MDMA from US to Mexico would be anyway? Usually they&#039;re worried about people bringing stuff from Mexico to US not the other way around ;)

TRUST me, the sniffers WILL find it and the body scanners too (if they are still in use). The checked baggage method will work as long as the items are disguised properly. TSA still opens bags and manually inspects at random and they are thorough. Make sure if you make them into pills that they match whatever bottle they are in. In other words, don&#039;t mix in multicolored tabs with white pills like aspirin or whatnot...<br /><br />Whatever you do, wipe down the bottle/bags because they like to use the swabs to detect traces and that shit works!<br />

				You can always cut a very small slit into the trim of your luggage bag. Then fish the pills into the trim space. Same method as if you made a small incision at the top of your jeans and fish it around the top rim of your pants behind the area your belt covers.

				If you buy the right kind of capsules, <br />you can easely open some up and fill them with MDMA powder, then put them back in the bottle together with the other (similar) capsules. Once your where you want to take the powdered MDMA just start opening the capsules until you find the MDMA (choose a capsule that is not translucent and whose product has another color than MDMA). <br />Off course, the better you can wash the bottle (or even the capsules after filling them), the safer you&#039;ll be. <br /><br />Remember that most of the people just betray themselves by being to nervous/skared/... when (if) they get searched. Stay cool. You&#039;ve done all that&#039;s needed to get threw security/customs without any problem. Noone will find anything. Stay cool...

				Traveling with small amounts isn&#039;t an issue. The more you worry about it the more you&#039;ll look suspect just from having anxiety about the whole thing. Just put a small amount in a baggie and shove it in a small pants pocket or with your toiletries.<br /><br />Customs at the Cancun airport is quite easy. You literally walk up to machine and press a button. If it&#039;s green you go out the exit no questions asked. If it&#039;s red, they do a small search of your bags but nothing serious. Just don&#039;t dress like a slob and you will be fine.<br /><br />Also - I try to get in line and look for someone who has just gotten a red light when they pressed the button. Odds are a red light won&#039;t show for the next 5-10 people in that line.

				Festival season is upon us, and I&#039;m faced with this same conundrum. My package arrived from Mister M100 yesterday, and his stealth is so clever and ingenious that I would be comfortable hiding it in plain site in the event any LE poking around my vehicle. However, due to my own ignorance as to specific packing methods and their reliability over time (shipping time, intermittent lull, drive time to fest) I can&#039;t be positive that a dog search wouldn&#039;t bring them to the proverbial doorstep. Alot would depend on the dog&#039;s training, how it alerts, what it alerts to, and the like, but I feel like a precise MDMA loving pooch could bring LE as close as they need to be to figure it out. I&#039;ve read alot in the shipping forums as to what methods they use to bypass customs, and, assuming that these methods should be good enough to beat local and state lawmen, have been devising my own methodology for moving my weight. I only plan on taking 10g max, but maybe even just 5 to pay for my trip. There are plenty of options and opinions out there. I was intrigued by these &quot;bear bags&quot; that are designed to be 100% odor proof so bears don&#039;t find your goodies (they love drugs too,) and apparently their sense of smell is even better than K9s. One user commented on the bags that they were exactly the same as his method only brand named with a ziplock and outrageously priced. I&#039;m one of those people who loves problems that can be solved by throwing money at &#039;em. And for me the simplicity and convenience of these consumer ready bags are very appealing. I&#039;m not discounting the fact that proper handling still needs to be adhered too. Gloves, wash, bag, rewash, new gloves, bag, etc.<br /><br />Before carousing the forums for tips, I had originally devised a plan to take 24packs of water bottles, carefully remove the bottles, open and dose the interior bottles with &#039;singles&#039;, and repackage. This was assuming that the water would provide a smell barrier. I haven&#039;t been able to find any info that specifically debunks this idea or any that confirms it&#039;s merit. Water could be sports drink, any plastic wrapped, resealable containers that can be made inconspicuous.<br /><br />Finally, one more solution I&#039;ve stumbled upon is a product for sale on SR. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/133220c69b/10<br /><br />Optiman sells this magnetic car safe that he claims to be airtight and therefore smell proof. A good hiding spot in the engine bay and the safe would appear as innocuous as the fuse box. If I go this route I won&#039;t necessarily discard my other precautions, but may compound methods. Although the safe could allow me to unpackage the MDMA and divide into appropriate doses and eliminate the need to travel with a scale. For maximum confidence, I would leave it packaged, seal, wash, seal, wash then into the safe, which would be washed, pack a clean scale and stick it where the sun don&#039;t shine (on my car.)<br /><br />Ideas, comments, concerns, criticism?<br /><br />

				I plan on bringing a few grams over seas and I&#039;m just going to empty a few vitamin capsules, then refill them with the goods and check them with my luggage and about 3 other vitamin bottles. The stuff I have is white, so it will blend in well in the pill case. Then once I get to the hotel I&#039;m going to split it up into other capsules which I will empty out at the hotel, for proper dosage. With say 5 capsules with 2 grams, it should be easy enough to guess how much is in each capsule and how to properly split them up.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few pills isn&#039;t going to stink your bag up or look suspicious and I HIGHLY doubt they actually take pills out and inspect them. At most they open the lid and shuffle them around. <br /><br />Taking it on board on the other hand seems like a huge risk. You have airport dogs, sniffers, hand to hand TSA searching bags thoroughly and just an overall minefield to worry about. Checked bags go through screeners and sniffers, but they&#039;re looking for large quantities of drugs or bombs/explosives.

I&#039;m totally aware of what precautions to take in regards to safe travel.

I even saw one bastard unroll a kid&#039;s socks and stick his entire arm into em to ensure there was no contraband. The fuck! Anyway, I can&#039;t reveal too much about the vendor&#039;s stealth method, but suffice to say that if one has made the appropriate arrangements, the package would appear 100000000000% innocuous. So even if the lucky winner of a free search, I&#039;m not really worried. There are rumors this year of increased checkpoints (the fuck for?!) and then the ever-present danger of a dog search. I suppose I&#039;m really just trying to vent my concerns in hopes that someone on here will review my strategy and tell me what they think.&nbsp; :o

				You can always travel with it in MBB after the outside has been wiped down with alcohol, and hide it somewhere in your car, not on the outside of the car, somewhere hidden in the dash or something

That&#039;s why your body comes with all of those cool orifices. Wrap it in an un-lubricated condom and stick it into one.&nbsp; Full body scanners don&#039;t look into you, and even if you don&#039;t pass the full body scan &quot;I&#039;m sorry sir, you seem to have a foreign object in your pants&quot; (really happened), they don&#039;t look inside your body.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get out of the gutter, I&#039;m talking about your mouth. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bullshit, the full body scanners are x-ray, they see inside you, they see your bones.

Jeebus rice<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is blatantly untrue.<br /><br />There are two types of body scanning technology in use by the TSA.&nbsp; There are Millimeter Wave Scanners, there are Backscatter X-ray Scanners.&nbsp; Only the Backscatter machines use x-rays.&nbsp; Millimeter Wave Scanners use electromagnetic radiation, which is sort of like bouncing a wireless signal off of the body.&nbsp; Backscatter machines are beginning to be removed from airports, and will not be in use after June, because they show a nude body, and federal law now requires software that renders a cartoon representation, for privacy reasons. (clearnet link to NYT article on Backscatter removal: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/tsa-to-remove-invasive-body-scanners.html?_r=0)<br /><br />Millimeter Wave Scanners do not use x-rays.&nbsp; They use a relatively weak electromagnetic wave, which penetrates the clothing, but not the skin.&nbsp; They show prosthetic devices, including prosthetic breasts and testicles, and other hidden medical things like catheters.&nbsp; They reveal body piercings, but cannot find tampons.&nbsp; They are the equivalent of a strip search, not a body cavity search. (clearnet link to CBS News item on a bomb hidden in a guy&#039;s ass: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/28/eveningnews/main5347847.shtml)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone have personal experience with this?&nbsp; I&#039;m also considering taking some drugs to a festival this summer.&nbsp; I have no problem stashing them in an orifice for the flight, but I&#039;m not clear on how safe it is.

				I do it with powders.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about scanner technology, but I&#039;ve gone through the scanners at least 6 times over the past two years.&nbsp; Either TSA can&#039;t see it, or they don&#039;t give a shit.&nbsp; In fact, I&#039;m gonna carry some of Subs&#039;s dope through next week. :D <br /><br />The only thing I know for sure though, is that TSA hasn&#039;t stopped me yet, so please don&#039;t do anything that&#039;ll get you sent to prison, based solely on my experience.
