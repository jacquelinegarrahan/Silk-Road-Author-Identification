			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m posting this here because I have 0 post on the forums, anyone that can move this to the appropriate section please do.<br /><br />Recently I had two state police bring a package to me, saying they knew it was mine and made an attempt to get me to open it.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying 1) yes, I denied 2) I didn&#039;t answer any questions or cooperate with them.<br /><br />They brought a package addressed to my po to my house hoping that I would do the hard work for them and open the shit. I refused and denied ownership and said I didn&#039;t order anything. They then told me that they had me on camera bringing packages to my house and back to the post office, and videos of me selling them weed multiple times (at this point I was thinking so fuckin what nigger). They also said they&#039;ve been watching me for like a year and that they know I send money out to my buddy and get packs back in but the address on the boxes are fake except for the one I&#039;m using for the cash (which is obvious, why would I send money to a fake address). I&#039;m sure they were just stating the obvious truths for anyone that&#039;s doing this shit.<br /><br />Nothing is or ever has been at my house except for my computers so I&#039;m not worried about them coming to my house, I just know they&#039;re going to be following me for a while and I want to know how I can make this task a pain in the ass for them as much as possible. Should I change my cell number or get a new phone? I use a prepaid iPhone right now that isn&#039;t linked to me in any way, I&#039;m just scared they can wiretap my shit.<br /><br />If they did take the package back and get a warrant for it, what am I looking at? Maybe a random search of my house (the house I live in is in someone else&#039;s name who doesn&#039;t live here currently) or just being followed for a year or so?

				Bummer, but good too. You are in a good spot, but you are OUT OF BUSINESS for now.<br /><br />Were they right about the stuff they said? What did you mean by &quot; so fuckin what nigger&quot; ?<br /><br />Do you deal IRL where you can get videotaped?&nbsp; If I were you I would try seeing if my new suppliers could drop ship to my customers.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t afford to stop dealing, move out of the state.<br /><br />Modzi

				Get the hell out of dodge NOW. Running is not illegal, because you, as of now, are not being charged with anything. They cann&#039;t keep you to the state. Move across the country and restart. Drive, and buy a lockbox for all of the drugs you have to bring across the country. Buy a car on craigslist and sell yours. <br /><br />Just go. This way, you can continue dealing and getting packages, and you won&#039;t have to worry about the fucking law.

				Moving out of state would get you the hell out of that bad situation. You can have packages shipped to you anymore that contain illegal goods. Move out of state and you will be fine. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t be obvious. Do you have a real job? Are you able to get by without dealing? If so, stay where you are. If not, bail.

				I would also be careful posting the same thread on reddit as you have here, I hope you are using reddit through tor, every time you create cross links like that you increase the probability of someone identifying you.

				Listen to jjoz. I see morons double posting between Reddit and Silk Road all the time. Sometimes I&#039;m kind enough to PM them and warn them that they ARE being morons. <br /><br />Always use that shit through Tor, and never, ever, ever cross post.

				Yeah I posted on reddit but I used tor on everything and made 2 new accounts. I&#039;ve been using tails on my broken laptop that doesn&#039;t have an HDD in it and none of my computers are at home so I think I&#039;m straight...<br /><br />I can get by without it but it&#039;s just fucking boring going from doing whatever you want to do to having to have a job and shit, but the real world sucks cock. <br /><br />I could move and start vending online, I get it cheap as fuck anyway and everyone here would love it but I have a feeling I&#039;d be in the same situation that I&#039;m in now.

				If you don&#039;t have handcuffs around your wrists - they don&#039;t have shit. If you do - get a lawyer. If you don&#039;t - don&#039;t say a word, be polite, and stop doing business.<br /><br />If they had anything legitimate on you, they&#039;d arrest you on the spot. I&#039;ve seen someone get arrested because he shared a name with someone with a warrant for his arrest. Video tapes of you dealing? Ya right, your ass is booked months ago if it were true.

				Remember: cops can lie.<br /><br />How much do you *know* that they have on you? How much of what they&#039;re claiming could be pure bullshit trying to coerce a confession? Try to find out.<br /><br />No matter what though: assume you are being recorded AT ALL TIMES now - phone tap, follow car, friends snitching on you, the works. So don&#039;t say or do anything an innocent person facing the same (totally baseless, of course) accusations wouldn&#039;t do.<br /><br />And seriously, get a good criminal defense lawyer. Losing $$$ is worth a lot less than jail time.<br /><br />And lastly: SHUT THE FUCK UP with the police. Don&#039;t even deny anything, just say NOTHING.
