				Anyone experienced in the area of controlled deliveries.......are there any Red Flags that you should be aware of when tracking a package on the USPS.com website that would alert you that a controlled delivery might be coming?&nbsp; Ive had packages in customs for 2 weeks and then they come out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also had packages that stay in there for an hour or less and seem to pop right out.&nbsp; When tracking on the site though, are there ANY real red flags at all?&nbsp; Would it look completely normal and say &quot;out for delivery&quot; as they were coming to your door to do a controlled delivery, or would there be some fishy stuff going on on the site?

				There won&#039;t be any red flags, just don&#039;t sign for anything and hope for the best. The postal workers move as quickly as possible during a controlled delivery and make sure everything seems as it ordinary as possible.

				If your package is waiting at a box that you bought at a UPS store, is it unlikely that they would do a controlled delivery then?&nbsp; How would it work at a UPS store you think?&nbsp;

				They would probably have you pick it up and then arrest you at some point between taking the package and getting to your car. I&#039;d recommend getting deliveries to your house as you have little more control/deniability in the event something goes wrong.

				I have a buffer system set up where a person picks up the package at UPS box who doesnt know where I live.&nbsp; They cant search my place if I am nabbed at UPS store I can always be like I&#039;m staying with a friend I&#039;m broke.&nbsp; They wanna search your place and show up at your door, youre pretty fucked.

				Yeah that&#039;s the system I have set up.&nbsp; I once had a package delivered to a buddy, when he came, it had the actual name of what was inside, taped ALL on the top of the box, letting everyone know what the substance was inside the box.&nbsp; It was opened by customs in India, flagged, and still made it to my door completely fine.&nbsp; We were shitting our pants.&nbsp; Guess they didnt want to be bothered.&nbsp; That was like 2 years ago.
