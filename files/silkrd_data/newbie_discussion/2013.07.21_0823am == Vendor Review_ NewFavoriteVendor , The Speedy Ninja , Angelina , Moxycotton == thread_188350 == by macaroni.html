				Hey all. Reviewing a few vendors from the past month on Silkroad. I don&#039;t have much experience with drugs and SR has just let me test the waters with a bunch of different stuff I wanted to try. Sorted from newest to oldest.<br /><br />1. NewFavoriteVendor: 1 ~ WOW 100ug LSD Tab<br /><br />Communication: 10/5 - They were great about answering any questions I had about it. It was my first time doing LSD and they walked me through how much to take and the best way to take it. I got a message as soon as it was shipped, too. Couldn&#039;t have been any better here.<br /><br />Shipping/Stealth: 10/5 - I paid for first class shipping and it was here 3 days from ordering. Really impressive and awesome stealth. Blends right in with my other mail. Packaging is even deceitful and would pass close inspection even if it would have been acccidentally opened or anything.<br /><br />Product: 10/5 - My first LSD experience and it was great. I had researched people selling nbomes and had worries about bitterness. My tab was completely tasteless - couldn&#039;t even tell it was in my mouth. I&#039;m no expert but it seemed like a really clean product. <br /><br />Trip Report: Kicked in about 20 mins after taking it. Started out as more of a head change; just a little lightheaded. After I stood up and walked around a bit, it was fantastic. Started seeing a lot of trails - my hand movements and birds flying the sky had trails behind them. The colors outside seemed a lot brighter. After about an hour and a half after taking it, I went to the park. It was just like LSD trips in movies; rainbow colors and a lot of distortion and waving effects on everything. It was everything that I imagined would happen. I had some pretty solid hallucinations, too. Once, I literally saw myself in a different decade. I was laying in the park in the 70&#039;s and it was a total out of body experience. Another time, I became a comic book cartoon character. Everything was interesting and bright - I could not have gotten bored just by lying in the grass for hours. \Once I started coming down, it was very smooth. No extreme nausea or paranoia like I had experienced with taking mushrooms. It was 10x better than my mushroom trip and I would definitely do this again in the future.<br /><br />Overall 10/5. NFV set the bar pretty high for me and I&#039;ll be back if I ever want more acid.<br /><br />2. The Speedy Ninja: 20 Modafinil 200mg tablets<br /><br />Communication: N/A - none received but none needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Shipping/stealth: 5/5 - I picked priority shipping and it got here in 3 days, so props to them for getting it out quick. It made it here fine, so obv the stealth was good. No one would have known what is was if opened, but it was so plain that i&#039;d take a second look if I was a PO inspector and it came open on me. I&#039;m probably being paranoid about this though. <br /><br />Product: 10/5 - I heard this stuff was supposed to be like the drug from the movie Limitless. My hopes were low, so maybe that&#039;s why I like these pills so much. Sad to say it didn&#039;t turn me into a wall st millionaire like the movie, but it does help with energy/concentration. I have low iron and suffer from tiredness even after a full nights sleep. Half a pill in the morning and I&#039;m good to go. It&#039;s not that it really gives me more energy...It just takes care of that tired feeling I&#039;ll always have. I cried the first time I took one because it had been so long since I hadn&#039;t felt tired. Definite concentration boost, I could sit down and write a 10 page report in a day if I take a full pill, but a whole one gives me a little headache after a while. I think tolerance builds up pretty quick. I only take them on days I really need it. I&#039;ve never tried adderall but I&#039;d think this might be pretty close to it.<br /><br />Overall 5/5. Really nothing but good things to say about this vendor and product. Will buy again.<br /><br />3. Angelina: Butterscotch THC suckers<br /><br />Communication: 5/5 - Ordered several times and always got a message when they shipped. It means a lot to me just to get something simple like this. Shes a sweetheart.<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5 - Pretty sure I always stuck with first class and they&#039;d show up within 5 days. Stealth was fine. Not super concealed but it&#039;s not like a bunch of suckers would draw much attention and scent is taken care of. <br /><br />Product: 10/5 - Amazing product all the way. My first time with a single sucker had me feeling it even the next day when I woke up. Two will make me retarded. I&#039;ve passed these around to friends and everyone loves them. They have a very strong weed smell once you start on them. A friend ate one in my car while I went to a store and the car totally reeked when I got back in. It&#039;s all good tho, just means you know you&#039;re getting good stuff :P<br /><br />Overall 5/5. My only repeat purchase so far and i&#039;m sure I&#039;ll buy alot more in the future.<br /><br />4. Moxycotton: 1 Oxy/Opana OP80 pill<br /><br />Communication: 4/5 - Had to message a few times wondering where it was, but always got a reply within a day or two. Kind of lead me on with supply issues and shipping times, but its whatever.<br /><br />Shipping: 2/5 - My biggest issue is that I paid for priority and it took almost 2 weeks. This freaked me out thinking I was gonna get a CD. I guess stealth was okay since it made it, but it could have been a lot better. Another one of those things where if it was opened, it was so oddly plain that someone might be suspect to dig deeper and there wasn&#039;t much to hide it if someone did.<br /><br />Product: 5/5 - The only opiates i&#039;d done before this were a handful of lortabs and vicoden, so this was a step up. Cheaper to buy an 80 for $50 than 30&#039;s for $30+ so what the heck. I only planned on doing half but ended up doing the other half later. Fun times were had but it was impossible to sleep from cold chills im guessing were withdrawls. I felt really guilty the next day too, prob cause I know these pills aren&#039;t something you wanna get started on. Opi&#039;s are probably my favorite drug but I could never afford the habit and the addiction potential scares the shit out of me. I&#039;ll keep them to a once or twice a year thing like I have been. <br /><br />Overall 3/5. Product was great but I can&#039;t handle lies about supply and shipping times. <br /><br />

				NewFavoriteVendor: 1 ~ WOW 100ug LSD Tab<br /><br />Communication: 10/5 - responded fast to my order<br /><br />Shipping/Stealth: 10/5 - I paid for priority and my package was hear with in two days of being marked &quot;in transit.&quot; Stealth was nicely done.<br /><br />Product: 10/5 - My first LSD trip. Almost tasteless. Slight metallic taste after putting on tongue but its very very little. One hit lasted me about 10-12 hours.<br /><br />Trip Report: (Mindset: slightly depressed, lots of physical pain this past week. sidenote: I have ibs and this product caused no upset/nausea) Amazing.....For my first time, I dosed one tab around 8pm after a day of work. I held it on my tongue for a good hour just to make sure. I took a shower when I started having a rush of anxiety/excitement for what may lie ahead in the night. When I got out I put some clothes on and lied in my bed till I felt different. Bam, the textured ceiling above me was slowly moving like waves of water, now I knew that if I saw the ceiling moving, I knew I was still on acid and just fine. I smoked weed but it felt pointless, I didnt need it. I know I listened to music on and off, but wasnt having any crazy thoughts like I would have on nitrous. I enjoy crazy thoughts. Unfortunately, I couldnt do much at home because my mother was home and some other family as well, so I had to wait untill 11pm to watch tv without possible facing conversation, which I could hold, but I dont know how clearly I could speak. I started to text and every text I wrote I thought, &quot;what if my fingers were little tiny people.&quot; I thought about that all night. As I was outside, I felt like I was being watched through the darkness. Leaves crumbling in the distance. My hearing definitely increased. I smoked one cig, for me I like to see how cigarettes interact with other drugs, I didnt need it, I was perfect just how I was. The lights on houses stood in the corner of my eye, the lights flashed different colors. I went inside and turned on south park, it was so so so funny. Sorry if this trip report is all over, its like im recalling a lucid dream. I forgot to mention that since, another sign I knew it had started was because everything was funny even nothing. I switched the channel and started to watch banshee. It was so fucked up, I saw this one character as lucifer, or maybe he represented something inside of us that needs to be defeated in order for us to change. The faces where dark, but managed to morph like those funny mirrors and colors kept slightly changing in their faces. I went back up to my room now as it was around 1pm, where I lied with my german shepherd, he felt amazing with his long hair and warm body. I then listened to more music and tried to draw, but didnt have any blank paper or drawing utensils at hand managed some doodles though. Finally, around 3am I wanted to try and sleep so I took three capsules that I pressed, 249mg california poppy and 474mg wild lettuce. It worked, I fell asleep around 3:30am, and woke up at 10am to the sound of a vaccuum. I felt great, best hangover is no hangover. I want to do it again. <br />You lived up to your name and now you are my new favorite vendor.

				My trip report for NFV<br /><br />Time of this report: 15 hours after dropping<br />Dosage: 2 Alex Grey 120ug tabs<br />Setting/mood: Just got off 3rd shift at work and alone in my house. Was in a great/exciting mood for the weekend and my pending ....experience.<br /><br />I took 2 tabs(tasteless) at 8 am, after reading reviews of others experience and came to the conclusion that I needed to adjust my dosage for more &quot;typical&quot; trip.<br /><br />My honest thought process before dropping 2 tabs this morning was that I mentally more powerful then LSD and could control any effect of any drug as i have for the last 18 years...I will never make that assumption again.<br /><br />COMEUP: Within 40 mins my anxiety shot through the roof, slight to extreme trembles, trouble focusing on any task even as miniscule as browsing youtube, heartbeat increased, and i started getting scared and tried fighting the comeup even to one point texting my significant other to come home, they were unable of course. I was all alone, but i consider myself an extreme introvert...i thought to myself this is exactly where i wanted to be...<br /><br />The comeup was really bad for me because i tried to fight it, i attempted to keep a clear head and not let my brain wonder, about 9:15 my head and neck became extremely hot, so i kicked the ac down super low and grabbed a bag of ice, adjusting the ice around my head and neck i put on some comforting music and closed my eyes for about 30 mins. Vived extremly fast shifting closed eyed visuals raced on the back of my closed eyelids, when i opened my eyes the entire world had changed.....I had just hit the peak of my first REAL psy experience.<br /><br />PEAK 09:45: Everything looked as if it was underwater with swirling and distorting effects, the mouse cursor on the moniter trailed with every movement making waves through my computer screen that extended onto the surronding walls, with out being able to focus on the computer, i got up and went to the mirror, it was me in the mirror but my face quickly begain to shift, i saw myself grow old wrinkeled and quickley revert to a younger version, with multiple different versions of me, what i preceived at the time as what i looked like in other dimensions...It was then that my mind was blown completley open, i smiled and accepted this new vivd interpitation my eyes/brain made of the world.<br />A walk around the house had me looking at paintings that popped out and appeared to have depth with movign skys and trees blowing, looking at old photos of myself put that memory in time in full blown projection and my current body was there watching the moment happen.<br /><br />10:30: Feeling dizzy and my neck hot again i retreated to my computer room to re-ice and attempt youtube again. After listining to some comforting classical, i some how came upon the die antwoord video i fink your freaky, as creepy as that video was it didnt scare me, but made my laugh and helped me accept the trip and ride with it.<br /><br />Some point in the next hour or so the deadmau5 song raise your weapon came on(could only listen to the first 4 mins then would restart). This womans voice struck something deep inside me, i feared for situation, i felt the pain in her voice, and it really hurt like a lost loved one kind of hurt. I closed my eyes, and as I did tears ran down my face. From reading other peoples expereinces, i guess what happened next was what others call ego death.<br /><br />I cried for the first time in eight years, for the first time since my child was born. Initally a sad affair, it quickly changed to an emotion release that i felt i&#039;ve had built up my entire life. For a half hour i felt so inscure so ....vulnerable, this strong person i thought myself to be, the mental armor i spent years building around myself was completly gone.<br /><br />11:30: At this point i have completly quit trying to control/focus on anything and just closed my eyes and let the subconscious take over. The CEV&#039;s were so vivid and bright and beautiful, I just sat there with my eys closed watching shapes form and regress, twist and spin, stretch from the past to the future.<br /><br />12:30: My anxiety was completly gone, and I realized the peak had subsided...i think. It still seemed i was veiwing everything under a ever changing and distorting surface of water, but it had became the norm and was pleasent. I was in a state fo euphoria of sorts. I had started the harry potter movies earlier this week and decided to resume them. And so i spent the rest of the day absorbed into 3 of the movies, so embedded into the story time flew by. Feeling exhausted by 6 pm i laid down and immediatly fell asleep for abour 3 hours.<br /><br />I awoke around 9-10 pm and just meditatted putting all the pieces back together, sharing my experience with my significant other.<br /><br />Thank you NFV, for my eyes were closed but now I see.
