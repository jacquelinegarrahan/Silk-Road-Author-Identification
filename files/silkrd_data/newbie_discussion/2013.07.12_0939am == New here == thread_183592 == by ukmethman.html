Almost everyone shorts others, you&#039;re typically buying from people who re-sell.. So they&#039;re out to make a profit, it&#039;s not actual growers or distributors.

				Read the wiki and ask here in the newbie forum!<br /><br />You&#039;ll get what you order and the quality (IME) has been absolutely superb with everything I&#039;ve ordered.<br /><br />I&#039;m also a vendor and everything I sell is top quality.<br /><br />One thing you can be sure of here is that you will get a high quality product. If it&#039;s not then leave a bad review - vendors do not want bad reviews.

				Becoming a vendor is quite easy. Under Account settings on the marketplace there is a link called &quot;become a vendor&quot;. <br /><br />All you got to do is click that link, pay the vendor fee (I believe it is 500$), and you have officially become a vendor.<br /><br />Usually you get a full G, or sometimes a little more.<br /><br />The best way to start out as a vendor, is to find a couple of respected forum members, and offer them Free/very cheap samples, and if your product-price range is reasonable that will usually get the ball rolling. Also being friendly, and having good costumer support is an important thing, if you want to become a successful vendor.

				My friend welcome to Silk Road.<br /><br />Lets me express my opinion about SR.<br /><br />SR&nbsp; is a market like others only with substances. That mean that competition and variety of products is high. It has all the characteristics of a global market. Quality at its best, reviews of products and vendors, and really competitive prices. <br /><br />I would advise you that before buying stuff you should made a good market research about the product you want. Fortunately there are lots of vendors and products to choose from. Take your time before you order, it is worth it. <br /><br />As for the quality, most of the cases are corrected or even you get more than expected. It all about marketing and reputation so trying fooling your customers is not a thing that vendors do. Instead they try to be more good with you and try to please you.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I have to say in a brief text.<br />Take care,<br /><br />Adamiz

				Thanks again for the replies.<br /><br />I like the idea of a bond being paid to set up an account, protects buyers and weeds out the dreamers.... <br /><br />I can easily sell my product at the bottom price range being offered at the moment but I think I need to take some time and settle in on these forums a bit first&nbsp; ;)

If i could give out karma you would get a +1 from me, for that.<br /><br />I think way to many people just jump right in, without getting to know the community first, and this is often the reason why they fail!<br /><br />Take your time, get a feel of the community, and research which kind of things might give you an edge.<br />I honestly believe that the amount of research, and effort you put into it, is directly proportional to your chance of being successful, in the end.<br /><br />I wish you all the best of luck with your future endeavors.
