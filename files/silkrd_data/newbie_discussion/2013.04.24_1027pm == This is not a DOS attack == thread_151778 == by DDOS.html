				This is not a denial of service attack. You can not do a DOS attack on tor hidden services. This is a null byte attack. This is only happening because Silk Road is coded very poorly.

				Perhaps you should PM Dread Pirate Roberts and let him know?&nbsp; The more feedback the better on how to combat the bastard(s) that are pulling this off and doing a pretty damn job at it I might add.&nbsp; Just when you think you&#039;ve got it covered someone has exploits vulnerability.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s just timing that the Bitcoins are going up.&nbsp; The correlation would perhaps be more convincing if people had all of their orders in, SR was being attacked and the the value of the bitcoins plummeted.&nbsp; Now that would seem more like it was orchestrated but because the bitcoins are rising that&#039;s not something that I see as a correlation to SR going down.&nbsp; &nbsp;You could day trade Bitcoins right now as they&#039;re swinging like a big dick and stuff some profit in your pocket.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to make a few couple hundred here and there, might as well take advantage while the volatility is ever present.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It does seem like in the past we&#039;ve gotten one story only to find out later its something else. This is very typical for website/online businesses... When bitinstant was hacked they had a message up all weekend saying they were down for routine maintenance. I believed them and immediately deposited $$ when the came online Monday... it took me 1.5 weeks to finally get my BTC on my SR account..<br /><br />As long as its not the DEA or some other equally hated entity I don&#039;t really care.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anybody really cares whats going on as long as things go back to normal and all our information and BTC are safe!!<br /><br />Any idea&#039;s as to what IS going on?&nbsp; I read OP but due to my lack of knowledge on these things I have no idea how to make sense of it.&nbsp; Everything written could be complete jibberish made to sound logical/intelligent and I wouldn&#039;t have a clue.

				I posted about this earlier, but no one listens to the new guys. It is definitely not a DDOS. Use your heads. Why would the latest maintenance message state that the DDOS is still going on, yet you can access the site, but certain features don&#039;t work (picture uploads). This is a lie to cover up the fact that SR is on php 4 and got hit with the null byte attack. Theyre trying to upgrade not only their site code, but also their LAMP to fix the issue. Problem is, this shouldn&#039;t have been an issue to begin with. This is what happens when you have someone learning to code, while fixing a site.

				read the most recent &quot;maintenance&quot; thread.. newbie&#039;s aren&#039;t the only ones scratching their heads about this&nbsp; &quot;DDoS&quot; downtime.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newb and completely agree. Do five minutes of research and you&#039;ll understand the basics on how, and what a DDoS attack is and does.&nbsp; It&#039;s not sophisticated, but effective at bringing a webserver down.&nbsp; The question that is relevant is how that could take place over a Tor networked connection/s, and more importantly, how come users are seeing the 500 error messages; this means the file serves are not responding, at least by us.<br /><br />I would assume DPR and staff have literally unplugged the gear and are logged into their servers tying to isolate the problem and confirm no data was compromised.&nbsp; Sophisticated attacks are not just entry-point vulnerabilities but also malicious via embedded code (virus&#039;) once they&#039;ve breached the security systems.<br /><br />Ideally all data would be able to be mirrored in a secondary, or even tertiary environment, invisible to the attackers so that if a breach occurred it could be isolated, studied, and fixed, while the file and web servers would kick on via alias private network mapping and allow the &quot;storefront&quot; to continue.&nbsp; I doubt SR has an active-active data environment... but would be nice, and ironically would save all of us money (SR and DPR included).<br /><br />Opposed to a DB admin, they need to hire a CCIE and an Ethical Hacker and begin the task of moving SR into a much improved phase 2, redundant, environment.&nbsp; Given: not an easy task by any stretch.

				Already posted on the maintenance thread, but this thread is filled to the brim with bullshit so I&#039;ll post here too. <br /><br />There are many application layer attacks on HTTP which make for very effective DDOSing. No malformed packets or SYN floods or UDP protocol required. OP can be forgiven ignoring these, I&#039;m guessing that despite his very authoritative tone that his experience in the field probably amounts to reading the nmap man page a few times. <br /><br />If this was an ancient PHP vuln + null byte attack, it could and would have been fixed by DPR by now, unless you are implying that he is a complete drooling idiot. In which case I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d use any of his services at all. This null byte claim is utterly unproven (since once would have to be on the inside of the situation to prove it), yet is curiously popping up all over the place suddenly - often in the same breath as hyping Atlantis.&nbsp; Interesting. <br /><br />And you guys making statements like &quot;no way you could have a maintenance page up during a DOS&quot; - christ, you really don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about, please stop making fools of yourselves.<br /><br />But you know, don&#039;t let basic facts stop you guys from wrapping that tinfoil so tight that it cuts off the circulation to your brains. I get the funny feeling that the same people muttering about DPR lying to them now were probably muttering something about &quot;false flag&quot; last week, so there&#039;s really no point trying to reason with you. Carry on.

The easiest way to prevent anyone from reaching a hidden service is to enumerate all of its introduction points and spam them with fake extend cells to exhaust their processing capabilities. You can also DDoS the hidden service in a traditional way, you simply need the nodes on the botnet to send their traffic through the Tor network up to the hidden service. It is just a normal server, it is not immune from anything. The server software itself could also have some bug or configuration issue that lets an attacker do non-bandwidth resource exhaustion. Tracing hidden services to entry guards is possible as well, at which point the entry guards can be DDoSed and if the HS is set to use strict entry guards then it will go down as well. In summary, you clearly have no idea what the fuck you are talking about so please stfu and gtfo.

Tor only transports correctly formed TCP streams, not all IP packets, you cannot send UDP packets over Tor. You can&#039;t do specialized forms of this attack like SYN flooding either. So denial of service attacks are not possible over Tor. Tor also doesn&#039;t allow bandwidth amplification attacks against external sites. You need to send in a byte for every byte that the Tor network will send to your destination.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You think that correctly formed TCP streams can not be used to exhaust bandwidth??? Well, that is completely wrong. Someone with a botnet doesn&#039;t need to do a bandwidth amplification attack to DDoS a target, they have a massive botnet with lots of bandwidth. Just having thousands of zombie clients refreshing a website constantly, many simultaneous times, is enough to DDoS it, and that is how many DDoS attacks are carried out.&nbsp; Also there are all kinds of other ways that DoS attacks can be performed. Hidden services are inherently weak to their introduction points being DoSed with CPU exhaustion attacks. They can be traced to their entry guards and the entry guards DDoSed, which will make it impossible to access the hidden service if it has strict entry guards set. The actual web server software can have flaws in it that make it weak to resource exhaustion attacks, a lot of the time DoS is of CPU or RAM and not of bandwidth at all. It is completely and entirely incorrect to say that DDoS or DoS are impossible to do against hidden services.

So it really shouldn&#039;t matter too much. Relying on a server / site operator to keep you secure is fucking retarded. Security is your own responsibility. On the other hand, maybe a misconfiguration or other issue has needlessly made the site vulnerable to DoS attacks. I have no idea. But it is incorrect to say that bandwidth DDoS , or anything like that, is impossible to do against a hidden service. Some very specific forms of DDoS are impossible to do over Tor, but some forms of DDoS are possible to do against hidden services that are not possible against clearnet sites.

Tor FAQ has something in its abuse section about how Tor is not just a big botnet to be used by anyone who wants to DDoS a target, or amplify the bandwidth output of their botnet. This is true! However, the original poster grossly misinterpreted this as meaning that hidden services cannot be DDoSed, or that DDoS attacks can not be carried out through Tor. What it really means is that, although some things , like UDP based DDoS attacks, cannot be carried out through Tor, that other sorts of attacks are not MAGNIFIED by Tor or made POSSIBLE by Tor. Tor can be used for anonymizing the source of a DDoS attack though. And DDoS attacks against hidden services are possible in all kinds of ways.

A North Korean nuclear missile taking out the server or an EMP taking out the server would be a DOS attack by that definition. Hell not paying your power bill would keep anyone from accessing the site.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">In a denial of service attack, the user sends several authentication requests to the server, filling it up. All requests have false return addresses, so the server can&#039;t find the user when it tries to send the authentication approval. The server waits, sometimes more than a minute, before closing the connection. When it does close the connection, the attacker sends a new batch of forged requests, and the process begins again--tying up the service indefinitely. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That is the real meaning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No that is one specific implementation of a DoS attack. There are CPU exhaustion attacks, memory exhaustion attacks, and all kinds of attacks that have nothing at all to do with bandwidth exhaustion. I believe what&nbsp; you just named is an open socket exhaustion attack, it doesn&#039;t even have to do with bandwidth. The most commonly known of form for a DoS attack is bandwidth exhaustion, but the term is so incredibly broad that it applies to all kinds of almost completely unrelated things. It is like saying &quot;2 + 2 IS NOT ADDITION 1 + 1 IS ADDITION&quot;.
