				Hello SR community,<br /><br />Once you go through the hassle of becoming a vender (Fee&#039;s, setting up shop, product management, etc...), and they receive funding on SR from payments, how do venders Take money from their Silk Road bitcoin address and turn it into cash / bank deposit / ? What is the process?<br /><br />I can get Bitcoin into SR just fine as a buyer: Cash -&gt; ZipZap location -&gt;blockchain.info -&gt; SR address used for buying<br /><br />I cannot, however, find a thread describing what sellers / venders need to do to get cash from bitcoins earned through sales.<br /><br />Any help is much appreciated from anyone. Bonus points for steps to conduct this completely separate from your real ID.

				You could sell them? If you transfer them trough a wallet service where they mix it and then they take some random coins and send them too the adress you request(That then can be an exchange service) who changes/buys the bitcoins from you with real money..

				It&#039;s simple to sell your coins at an exchange like mtgox. But selling your coins anonymously is a different matter and like packaging methods, you won&#039;t find much public discussion about it.<br />The only public methods I&#039;ve heard of is:<br /><br />Sell coins to a vendor for cash in the mail<br />Or to buy physical goods with your coins like gold or more drugs and sell them locally.<br /><br />It will take a bit of time for you to find a comfortable way of cashing out. And expect to pay a decent fee to get your coins turned straight to cash without needing to provide an ID.

				Ive wondered this before, like the above poster, doubt anyone is gonna share their techniques, this would be the one part of a vendors process that gets them caught.

				You could always just transfer your BTC into a buyers account and purchase goods you could sell easily to make a profit offline :)

				Thanks everyone for the replies.<br /><br />At least I am not the only one who doesn&#039;t understand how to properly egress the money out.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t found any information yet, but I will keep looking.

				I would say most vendors have their own unique way of cashing out - based on how liquid their cash flow needs to be. I can bet that we won&#039;t disclose our methods&nbsp; :-X
