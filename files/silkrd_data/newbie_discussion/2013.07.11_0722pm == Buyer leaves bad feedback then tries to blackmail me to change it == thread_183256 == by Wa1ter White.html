				Some people will try anything to get some free stuff! <br /><br />I am afraid that it is hard to do anything about this, other than to blacklist the user, and shame him on the forum!<br /><br />It is a shame that this wonderful place have to be crawling with these opportunistic cunt scammers, but i guess that is the price of anonymity.<br />The worst thing about this is that it is probably cunts like this, who are the reason some vendors choose to hang on to buyer info for some time, because this is a practice that can eventually be devastating to a lot of innocent individuals if said vendor gets busted.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to sort out these despicable individuals, but in my experience they are increasing in numbers, and it is utterly frustrating to all the honest and genuine people, who eventually get afflicted by this!<br /><br />

				I guess that you would just remember their username/write it up somewhere.<br /><br />It should be noted that it is pretty easy to get a new username so the dude can just do that and come back and try again!<br />I believe that some vendors actually write down the address, and refuse to send to that address again, but in my opinion that is a bad practice as a vendor should never hang on to buyer info, no matter what the reason might be.

				There are two types of vendors; those that have been blackmailed for feedback and those that will get blackmailed for feedback.<br /><br />Best advice, add him to the vendor blacklist and move on.

				might be a little contorversial but here&#039;s my two cents:<br /><br />if any buyer is enough of an ungrateful POS, i.e. trying to scam the seller, this is unforgivable. shouldn&#039;t sellers be able to keep the username and address of these scammers on hand in order to avoid getting scammed in the future? or is this already an exception written into SR rules?

				I would guess buyers need to be able to change feedback so they can come back and update their FE feedbacks once they actually get their shit and try it (not that most of them ever do).

				Hey guys, <br /><br /><br />This is what the feedback says:<br /><br />&quot;Stealth: 0/5<br /><br />Took basically a week to arrive when a new seller....<br /><br />Speed: 0/5<br /><br />Scraggely, loose, amateur grown product...<br /><br />Quality: 0/5<br /><br />Numerous contact with only one reply...<br /><br />Communication 1/5<br /><br />Picture is most definitely not of product recieved...<br /><br />Trustworthy: 1/5 (Package arrived &amp; weighed up )<br /><br />Overall: 0/5 don&#039;t use this guy when there is MANY other MUCH CHEAPER, MUCH HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT and overall MUCH BETTER vendors out there!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve thought of a cunning plan to turn this round on the punk. I told him i agree to his proposal and to send me his address and i will send him an 1/8th.<br /><br /><br />Lets hope he goes for it. Then the blackmailer will become the blackmailed. <br /><br />and if that doesnt work, he&#039;s at least getting a big ol dog turd in the post. :)<br /><br />

				Allude to scammers on your profile and how they will be barred or this particular scammer.<br />But be polite. <br />I shy away when a vendor sounds too agressive.<br />They may be rightfully angry but calm and collected comes better across,more professional.<br /><br />If the rest of your feedback is good this odd scammer will stand out&nbsp; more as an obvious scammer.<br />You often see it with 98-100% vendors.The scammers are easily spotted.<br />And your scammer is basicly one of those obvious ones:D.<br /><br />0 for stealth?? Trust me a non-scammer would have been more specific on that part alone.<br />And his conclusion is so over the top:).<br /><br /><br />All part of the trading business,be it here or normal clearnet markets unfortunately.<br />Always those that will try to push you around and try to freeload.<br /><br /><br />

				Walter to combat this i would put on the sales page in question, a short simple explanation on the negative feedback.<br /><br />But if sales are good, that bad feedback will drift on by fast enough.<br /><br />And also if you have consecutive good 5/5 feedbacks and a 1/5 comes along i think people are intelligent enough to make there own mind up its a one off, how ever if your getting shit scores its time to change tactics.<br /><br />
