				Let me start by saying please excuse me for my stupidity but I am very new on here. I accidentally (and I say accidentally bc i sincerely dont know how it happened) sent a bitcoin deposit to the wrong bitcoin address instead of my own, is that $ just got now or is there anything I can do? I really hope my few $300 deposit didnt just end up in some unkowing persons account....any help or advice would be greatly appreciated

				I&#039;m assuming you mistyped the address? If so, unless by some astronomical miracle, the account is currently held by somebody, AND you can get in contact with them, AND they&#039;re willing the refund it, you&#039;re fucked. Likely, nobody will ever see that money. Sorry man ;_;.

				It&#039;s hard to type in the wrong address since they have checksums in them. However you could paste the wrong address from somewhere I guess.<br /><br />Unfortunately if this happened you&#039;re out of luck. Sorry.

If you copied the address to an account that&#039;s actually held by somebody, you _MIGHT_ be able to get in contact with them. Copying the wrong address gives you a better chance than mistyping it.

Of course, that rules out those with a dynamic IP, behind proxies, wallets not spawned through the Internet... and, of course, even when you do get an IP address, you have to correlate it with a contactable identity...<br /><br />Obviously, not very easy, and has a very low chance of working, but it&#039;s a question of balance; is the time it would take to do all of this (and probably still fail) worth more or less than $300?

				man that sucks! im betting your funds are gone. well, not gone but being used by someone else.&nbsp; :-\ i always copy and paste to a sticky note then copy and paste to address location. double check and make sure its right before you send. when you get transferring your money down pat, and are ready to make an order, you should MAKE SURE that the vendor you are ordering from is established and has a good rep. i wouldnt settle for anything under (95) score and that is if they have been around for a long time. read review on the vendor. check them out in the forum too. hope this helps, it sucks being new as i am farely new too, but have got the hang of things

				there is sooo much info in the forums ab bitcoins but here is how i do it. safest way? maybe not but it always works for me and never had any issues. <br />set up a mtgox account. then make a deposit with bitinstant at walmart. i usually use my real at bitinstant and walmart bc its not illegal to get bitcoins and the ppl at walmart dont even know what the money is going towards. so dont try to explain bitcoins, just tell them you are paying a bill online. the reason i use my real name is bc i have had a instance where walmart wouldnt except it bc the names didnt match. then go home and wait for your moneys to get to mtgox. prob be there before you get home. then go to instawallet and tranfer from mtgox to instawallet account. dont close your instawallet unless you save your address. i always leave mine open bc im scare of messing something up. this will take ab 20 min to get in your instawallet account. then i open two more instawallets and spit the funds between the two. then yet another instawallet send all funds to this one. then i send it to my sr account. this might be overkill, but if you have ever done time, then a little extra caution and a few hours is nothing. hope this helps man
