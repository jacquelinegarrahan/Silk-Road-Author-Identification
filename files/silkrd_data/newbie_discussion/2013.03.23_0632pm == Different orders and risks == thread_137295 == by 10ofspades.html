				Somebody might be planning to order psychedelics from the Silk Road soon, but he&#039;s a paranoid person and meticulously plans every detail weighing the risks for everything he does that could get him in trouble.<br />Which drugs would have less risks associated with ordering them?<br /><br />He&#039;s currently under the impression that LSD would be a safer psychedelic to order, as a sheet of paper is easier to disguise than tablets or powder.<br /><br />He&#039;s new to all of this so any opinions are valued.<br /><br />Apologies if this is thread done to death, but let&#039;s face it, the newbie board doesn&#039;t have the best post quality anyway.

				I&#039;d say that buying psychedelics that are legal in your country would be the safest thing, but yeah LSD is pretty easy to hide in a letter so that&#039;d also be pretty safe, any small amount of powder is also easily concealed. Pills would be a bit more of a problem though. You should also go with a vendor that is known for having good stealth if you&#039;re worried... But unless you live in a high-risk country, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about your order getting seized anyways. Even if it does get seized, there&#039;s usually not enough evidence against you for them to do anything, unless you didn&#039;t cover your tracks at all (not using PGP, etc.).

				Somebody is in the same situation, though he is looking to buy wholesale quantities. He would look into LSD, but even more into those Research Chemicals that may still be legal in his country. There are countries where certain Research Chemicals are classified as medicines, not illegal drugs. Therefore if he gets caught, one most probably gets away with fines. For example, -Nbome&#039;s effects resemble LSD somewhat, is also in blotters, and is cheaper than LSD.<br /><br />Your situation may differ, as each country is different.

				I think you&#039;re right about LSD vs. pills, to a degree, but personally I&#039;d be more worried about the other aspects of security--making sure you mix up your bitcoins so they are not traceable, making sure you follow good security protocols on TOR and keep all your software up to date, using a secure, clean drop, etc. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not covering your tracks and taking precautions in all of these aspects, it sort of doesn&#039;t matter if your package contains paper or powder.&nbsp; My 2 cents, anyway

				Could somebody direct me to a list of &quot;high risk&quot; countries?<br />This would be very helpful.
