				so,&nbsp; i&#039;ve been reading about people not finalizing at all and ripping the vendor off and im just wondering why the hell they would do that, when you order, you send the vendor your full name, your address, and your city, and possibly country, like honestly, how fucking smart is it to steal drugs from a guy who knows where you live and probably has lots of firearms and weapons since hes pushing large amounts of drugs, can someone explain this to me?

				It goes both ways. Vendor&#039;s rip of buyer all the time also. I guess when someone scams the vendor they use a drop so it can not be traced back to them.<br /><br />They do it to get free drugs. Some buyers setup multiple accounts and but from 5-6 vendors never FE and they make out ok.<br /><br />Just part of the business.

				A good portion, not all of course, but a good % of people who use drugs, especially actively strung out addicts, will try any scam they think they might get away with. It&#039;s part of the game unfortunately.
