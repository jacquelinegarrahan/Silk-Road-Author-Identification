				Recently received what appears to be a seized package, vendor continues to ignore me.<br />Notice feels wrong, is very cheaply printed on standard printer paper. Any thoughts?<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/eAdL.jpg

				I am by no means an expert, but .... Dept of Homeland Security? Maybe things have changed, but as far as I knew Customs &amp; Border Protection handled these sorts of things, sending a standard sized 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; letter when they seize something. Also, it doesn&#039;t make sense to me that they&#039;d contact you to let you know that they will be contacting you, but who knows.<br /><br />Good luck.

				yeah man that&#039;s a little shady. I had something seized once (not from SR) but the package had a small rectangular piece of paper attached to it but it def. looked legit.

I mean maybe Customs on our southern border are running cheap, we all know they are broke like the rest of our LE but why not a cheap copy of something like that? I mean this is sub-standard paper and grainy as hell. Plus vendor still ignores me. Would love to see some examples of other Mex-&gt;US seizure notices to compare.

				I said this already but I&#039;ll say it again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve received hundreds but never one like that but the tape is legit.&nbsp; It was TWO to FOUR American DOLLARS of weed and there is no reason for La Fuente to scam you for $2 of weed.&nbsp; I also doubt that customs would let a package through with customs tape all over it.

				I was really curious on this one because some years ago, a friend of mine received a so called &quot;love letter&quot; from the Customs and Border Protection Agency, and it didn&#039;t look anything like the pic that the OP showed, but it did look to the best of my recollection exactly like the pic in the link from Attacksia.&nbsp; But some of the wording in the one received by the OP was very close to the more familiar letter size Customs seizure notice, yet the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) number was different.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I went and looked up the CFR in the OP&#039;s notice [19 CFR 149.59], and sure enough it definately is about items being seized in US Customs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Matter of fact, there is an in depth explanation of it should you want to take a look at it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://www.ahpa.org/portals/0/pdfs/10_0115_19cfr149_complete.pdf<br /><br />Unfortunately, your notice is probably legit, although I don&#039;t see how that would indicate any sort of scam on the part of the vendor.&nbsp; Also, as long as it&#039;s the first/only such notice you have ever received, don&#039;t worry too much about it as I&#039;ve heard of many others who have received one (besides my friend whom I personally knew) and apparently they don&#039;t follow up past the second letter ...&nbsp; &nbsp;in that I doubt that you need to worry about the feds showing up at your door with a warrant or anything like that...&nbsp; although I understand that it must be pretty disconcerting to have gotten it at all..&nbsp; :{

				That is why I only order domestic dope.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want a package seized and then have the feds at my door.&nbsp; But from what has been written, apparently Customs will confiscate the drugs but now follow up with an arrest?&nbsp; If so, I will feel better about ordering from outside the country.&nbsp;

				Yea considering the price and all he probably wouldn&#039;t scam, plus the tape as you said. Still weird that the notice was so off, but i guess lower budgets are taking their toll? And im not worried about them coming anymore, it would have been said and done either at the post office or soon after. I was worried about my add. being flagged, but an international hash order came through 2-3 days after the notice, and plenty of domestic traffic. So i guess im just paranoid, probably all good.
