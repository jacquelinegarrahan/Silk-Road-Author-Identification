				Though I have a low post count, I am by no means a newbie.&nbsp; I have been a member of SR for over two years.<br /><br />I feel like moving to BMR or SM, two previously established websites, might be dangerous.&nbsp; LE likely has information on those websites.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like we&#039;re tricking them by switching websites; they would assume that we would look for more options.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking for the general opinion about switching.&nbsp; Do you think it&#039;s dangerous to simply make an account on another, already established website that LE has had time to gather information and continue business as normal?&nbsp; It seems only a matter of time before they take action on those websites as well.<br /><br />On the other hand, the quicker we move, the more difficult it is to locate. Maybe moving quickly is a good idea?&nbsp; Or the movement will spark more and more websites to emerge, spreading the market out so there is not one powerhouse for LE to go after to try and take down the entire market.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				SR didn&#039;t get shut down by some epic government hack though. The sad part is for all his talk about security, DPR made a bunch of real stupid, rookie mistakes that got him located. The very shit he kept warning us about in here he was doing in the real world.<br /><br />This was good old fashioned gumshoe police detective work, not a flaw in the Tor network.

				How long has SM been operating though....<br /><br />What if this bust has been in planning for quite some time and this SM is set up long before they do the bust so that once they bust DPR everyone goes there and makes new accounts and BAM, they have records of everything??<br /><br /><br />Could be just stupid paranoia on my part but it came to mind.

				I think it is still too soon to really do anything at this point. Who knows what information they have now and what they could be doing. Even if doing business on another site sounds good right now, it could be trouble. No one really knows what DPR has told anyone, what access has been given, etc. I think it would be better to just keep in communication and wait this out to see how far the feds are willing to go. I&#039;ve been trying to read every bit of information I can on this for now and stay up to date. That&#039;s about all anyone can do I think unless you have safe communications with your vendors/customers.

This never happened me before today but it could also be forum traffic which i&#039;m sure is as high as it ever was at the minute.
