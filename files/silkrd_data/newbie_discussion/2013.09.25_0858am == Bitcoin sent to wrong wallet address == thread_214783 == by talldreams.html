				you people need to understand that bitcoin is non returnable once you&#039;ve sent them. you must always check, double check then double check again that you have entered the right address before clicking to send the btc. you&#039;ve had an expensive lesson here, don&#039;t make it again for the sake of comparing the address you&#039;ve pasted to your own. it only takes 30 seconds but saves you losing your money.<br /><br />also, what the hell were you doing copying someone else&#039;s btc address to your clipboard in the first place? especially right before you were about to transfer coin yourself. not being funny, but doing that and then not comparing the address you pasted to your own before you clicked send was a really stupid thing to do.

				Kiss it goodbye... it&#039;s a one way transaction.<br /><br />Think about it; if it wasn&#039;t, everyone would just take their btc back after they bought their drugs.

				If i were u i would take out the information.<br /><br />I just found a ton of transactions made by your ip: http://blockchain.info/de/ip-address/66.114.33.250<br /><br />By the way: the only chance to get something back is to remember who owns that address and ask nicely. I have seen pretty sick things happen here. Someone got send 45 bitcoins out of the blue and asked in the forum what to do lol. Eventually he sent that back and the guy was so happy he gave him 20 bitcoins

				it is virtually impossible to find out the identity of a bitcoin wallet. it IS possible, but would require enlisting some very smart Phd students; and that would only work if the origal transaction sent to the wallet came from say coinbase which has each account tied to a bank account.<br /><br />if coins were bought and sent via a mixer, then forget it.<br /><br />the entire purpose of bitcoin is to keep the trail and identity anonymous. i know you&#039;ve heard this.<br /><br />it&#039;s painful losing money that way, but let it go. while bitcoins are not illegal, i suspect obviously you were using or intended to use for SR purchases. the person you sent it to probably figures as much; and could easily spin a story to the police that the funds likely were for illicit intentions.<br /><br />sorry, feel for you
