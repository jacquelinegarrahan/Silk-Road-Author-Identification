				yo,<br /><br />who has experience with cheating urine controls ?<br /><br />i am in a methadone program (and have a high dosage) and there every month or so they take a urine control for testing if any drugs were taken (if found, i am in big trouble).<br /><br />lately i took some coke so i saved some urine before and then put it into the freezer.<br /><br />a week later on the next control i did put it out and when it was body warm again went to the meth program and there gave this (before frozen) urine.<br /><br />would that work ?&nbsp; <br />wont they realize that it was frozen before ?<br /><br />are there any hints ?<br />answers please only from people that have real experience in this.<br /><br />thx.<br />

				No problem, if your urine sample&#039;s temp was okay.<br />If not, they would&#039;ve probably told you it&#039;s cold and asked you to provide another sample.<br />I&#039;ve cheated on many urine tests so I believe i can talk out of experience.<br />To be completely honest, I&#039;ve never frozen a urine sample before though.<br />But I don&#039;t think this could be a problem, after all the lab where it&#039;s tested has to put it in a cooler/freezer (not sure)<br />until they actually test it.<br /><br />I think you should be fine.

				well, the next day of pickup methadone, a week after the fake frozen urine, went well.<br />nobody said anything.<br />i received my methadone and was not asked to give a new urine sample.<br />it looks like it worked.<br /><br />of course before i gave the urine test, i carried it at my body, so it was body temperature when given.<br />but then again :&nbsp; they never control that, we just have to put it into a box and thats it. i never saw anybody checking<br />the temperature. besides, after 5-10 minutes in this box, its cold again anyway.<br /><br />my main concerns were if they discover in the lab that it has been frozen awhile.<br />obviously they didnt. (at least thats what i hope).<br />that means, my other frozen urine in the freezer is still usable and i can continue to do coke<br />for some time, that&#039;s really good news! :-)<br /><br /><br />but let me ask another question :<br /><br />does somebody know how in the average urine tests that doctors use (for methadone programs and so on)<br />is cocaine traceable.<br /><br />that means : if i took coke, how long does it take until my urine is clean again (until they cannot prove that i took coke) ?<br />i heard it is about 4-8 weeks, but those were rumours i guess.<br /><br />who knows more ?<br /><br />that means : who REALLY knows it?&nbsp; <br />no rumours please. <br />only if you work in a chem lab and have to do with such things<br />and really know what you are talking about, your answer is very welcome.<br /><br />of course there are different tests outside and noone knows which one my meth doc uses, but what is the average today ?<br /><br />what do i have to expect in the worst case (after how long the coke does not show up in my urine anymore?).<br />
