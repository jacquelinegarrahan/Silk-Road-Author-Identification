				Which vendors have you had excellent results with shipping shit within 48 hours maybe even less than 24 hours? I will start UglyPotato stellar, chem4coin stellar, 2hotchicks also right below them but still fairly stellar.

				Hoping Haizenberg pulls through on a clutch LSD order. Czech to Canada, express- think it can arrive in a week?<br /><br />edit- a week may be a lot of time to many of you, but Canada Post does not operate on Saturdays and Sundays, so to me it can be a miracle. Average time for domestic orders has been about 9 days.

				AmericaOnDrugs ships my product right away EVERY FUCKING TIME!&nbsp; I can&#039;t say enough praise about that vendor.<br /><br />BestBeans also had my order to me extremely quickly; ForeverJung usually does but this week seems to be taking longer than expected, was hoping to have it today; when he/she sent me a sample, it shipped in 2 days Priority, I placed this order Sunday night. :(<br /><br />Terabithia usually seems to ship pretty quickly but I caught him when he was having some issues that caused almost a 4 day delay in shipping; waited a week (only like 3 states away, domestic US) and nada, ended up needing a reship (which came VERY quickly!)
