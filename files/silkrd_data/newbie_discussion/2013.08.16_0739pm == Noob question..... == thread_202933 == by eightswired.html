				Sup,<br /><br />I heard about this site for a while but just recently figured out how to access it.&nbsp; I&#039;m about ready to pull the trigger and order something but....I had one question. Whats the best way to handle the shipping? I&#039;ve heard people say use fake names, use a PO Box, use a drop mailbox etc., is all of this necessary?

				I personally use my real name when shipping, raise no red flags when the name matches the property owner.<br /><br />Caveats being that <br /><br />#1. Im Canadian and even if I get busted with a personal amount of drugs, its probation + community service on weekends, my records clean so there&#039;s really no chance Ill spend any time in jail.<br /><br />#2. I have a very solid cover story, I have an absolutely insane ex who is on record uttering threats about &#039;ruining my life&#039; and &#039;ill be sorry&#039; I plan on blaming her if I ever get caught with mail order drugs, yeah I know, not noble, but fuck her, she killed my dog.<br /><br />#3. I have no other drugs in my house when I have an incoming order, if I get a warrant served they wont find anything else and my cover story will be all the stronger.

				You&#039;ll be fine. Use your real name, and if you&#039;re concerned about safety, don&#039;t order something like a pound of cannabis...<br /><br />Also, do NOT tell everyone that you use silkroad. in the event that you have been caught you&#039;ll have a lot of evidence against you if you do that.

				Most vendors require you to use your real name, and none will take responsibility for a non-delivered package due to the mailman knowing that nobody by that name lives at the address.<br /><br />If you want to be safe, don&#039;t order large quantities, use your name, order domestic, etc..<br /><br />Oh and never FE.

				Use your real name and address.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you absolutely want to use a different name you should try sending something to the address with the name you want to use.

				dont use pobox cause they can search for it or makew you sign for it. just send it to your place and use your name<br />if someone finds the drugs, just deny the whole thing. they cant prove you ordered trhem

				I&#039;m a little surprised about the &quot;use your real name&quot; advice. It was my impression that this whole place is supposed to be anonymous, end-to-end. Giving your details to drug dealers is probably not a good idea, IMHO.

				never use your real adress thats beyond stupid. LE can easily hide themselfs as a seller on this Website and once you place the order guess what happends? they got your adress and put you to jail for ordering drugs online thats what happends......<br /><br /><br />if you from the US use an address that is in your area but has like noone that lifes in it.. in most cities there are many homes unoccupied.. so you just let the stuff send to there, go to the mailbox, snatch it and run. Ive seen a good documentary on this lately about ketamine? its on youtube somewhere.. basicly what the guy did was order it online ( guess from silkroad?) search for homes that are getting sold or have some kind of garnishment on them or whatever and have it delivered there... if they trace the shit back to the address and even wait for you to pick it up you can still say you just tried to steal the mail...

				My opinion domestic (whatever size) &amp; international personal amounts - real name etc. Otherwise fake name all the way.

				A real name makes things less complex, but if you are a security person there are many ways to manipulate any exposure. Get creative.
