				Hey all SR Guru&#039;s and Newbies :D. I&#039;ve been a fan of the community but never had a chance to become a part until I decided to finally teach myself the ways of deepweb. Anyways, long story aside - I&#039;ve finally invested in the future (BTC) and decided to make two small purchases from significantly respected sellers. One I made on Wednesday 9/25 which has still yet to process to in transit.<br /><br />Ultimately my question is this - is it normal for established sellers to wait a certain period for new buyers before processing/shipping? <br /><br />Any words of wisdom, advice etc. would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />and always - flylow. 8)

What&#039;s the vendor&#039;s policy on buyers with no history? They may either not want to sell to you or want you to FE first. Have you tried messaging them? As a rule of thumb, brand new buyers should message the vendor first to make sure they&#039;ll accept your order.<br /><br />If it&#039;s not marked in transit by Sunday, you can cancel the order (if you bought Wednesday).

				For my first purchase (Wednesday) the seller did not specifically state they would not sell to first time buyers - seems legit (my order was processed at 11:47 p.m. UTC).<br /><br />For my second order the seller stressed less than 100 USD. Which I followed and only purchased ~88.00 USD.<br /><br />I guess I just have to be patient considering it can take up to 48 hours for my first order (Wed. to Fri.), as well as my last order (Thurs. to Sat.)<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping all goes well. Thanks for your input - alleviates a bit of my anxiety :P.

				What he said, you should always msg a new vendor before placing an order. I did it when I started and have never had a vendor cancel an order except when they fucked the price up which i understand<br /><br />Most vendors I order from process in under 24hrs but some vendors change it to intransit before mailing and some dont until it is in the box

				I did message my first seller on Thursday but received no response. I just sent a message to my second vendor. Again I thank you both for your constructive input and knowledge.

				If they&#039;re a high volume vendor, they may be swamped with purchases and bombarded with emails. so be patient. One message to the vendor is sufficient.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For my first purchase (Wednesday) the seller did not specifically state they would not sell to first time buyers - seems legit </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Couple things:<br /><br />Just because they didn&#039;t explicitly state that they won&#039;t sell to newbies, doesn&#039;t mean they will. You may end up canceling your order on that one.<br /><br />Also, none of what you, I, or anyone else has said in this thread indicates that the vendor is not legit. If I were a vendor, I&#039;d probably be skeptical about brand new buyers. Keep in mind that vendors are the primary target of LE. They have to protect themselves.<br />

				Totally Understood, I just want to establish myself as a reliable buyer - everyone has to get started somewhere. <br /><br />I appreciate the feedback and advice, again - keep it coming if you like.

				If you let everyone know what you&#039;re trying to buy, someone might be able to recommend a vendor for you (you still need to investigate for yourself, but it might help point you in the right direction).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been buying here for over 2 years, so I might be able to suggest someone.

				I&#039;ve been looking into getting benzo&#039;s (pref. Xanax) as well as Tramadol. The sellers I ordered from were both top of the top so to speak. Again, I may be wrong and any help/advice is a positive.

				Did you try WinstonWolfe?<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2a82d4e723<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought adderall from him a couple of times. He does require FE for new buyers, but you could by a very small quantity first. I can tell you that he is legit at least.He&#039;s got Ativan and Klon&#039;s for 4.50 and Restoril for 8. Sorry I&#039;m more into stims so I don&#039;t know many benzo sellers (plus I have my own prescription&nbsp; ;D).<br /><br />I&#039;ll look through the pill vendors I&#039;m following and let you now if I find someone who also sells benzos.
