				I could eat your entire prescription in an afternoon. I take the 2.5 mg lorazepam bars when I have nothing better. <br /><br />I fell your pain. I had a doctor give me .5 lorazepam once. I asked him if he was a sadist. <br /><br />Bastard.

				I&#039;ve just been a daily benzo user for the last 3 months approximately. But 3 weeks ago i had 4 days with nothing. By the end of day 2 i was obviously experiencing withdrawals not unlike mild opiate withdrawals. It took me by surprise happening so fast after only a short time of daily using. The &quot;mild&quot; was still a BITCH though! I hope my xanax gets here tomorrow!

				I remember the very first time I took 0.5mg Lorazepam.<br />I was sitting, scared shitless in the hospital. Then fuzz.<br /><br />Now, that much is like nothing to me, to my system.<br />And I don&#039;t take benzodiazepines on a regular basis.

				I sent you a message on sr bruce campbell. I just called the doctor&#039;s office instead of going in, so it&#039;s not like i wasted my money, but still. Sent message on sr only cuz i get alot of spam/scams in my message box on the forums. Having to use my cell phone andit won&#039;t let me go to your vendors page. Tried typing in just your name and send a message page was all that would come up.

				Somebody on the market has the username &quot;Bruce Campbell&quot;. I don&#039;t have a space in mine. If you didn&#039;t see a vendor page you messaged the wrong user. Usually somebody makes impersonation accounts of vendors with slight variations. And you should not be using TOR from a cellphone bro. <br /><br />
