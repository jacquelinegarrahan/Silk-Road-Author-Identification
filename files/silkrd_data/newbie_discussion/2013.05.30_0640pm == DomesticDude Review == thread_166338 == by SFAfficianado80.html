				I ordered Molly from DomesticDude twice now and have been consistently satisfied.&nbsp; <br /><br />I FE&#039;d for both orders and never had an issue.&nbsp; He shipped quickly and it arrived quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Re: Communication - He is a high-quality vendor who could teach others a lot about communication... He is super responsive and honestly nicer than he even has to be.&nbsp; I asked him if he was willing to set up a custom order for me since I am a returning customer and he was more than happy to work with me on that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Re: Quality, it&#039;s very high. Even for someone who rolls around once a month like myself, I rolled hard with very little comedown afterward. With anything but the highest quality of Molly, that would not be possible.&nbsp; My friends also raved about it. These are not people that are new to rolling so we were a little skeptical and, to be honest, I got a bit greedy with the dose I gave myself.&nbsp; Lesson learned.&nbsp; I did not need to dose as highly as I have in the past.&nbsp; That&#039;s a VERY good thing.&nbsp; I actually didn&#039;t even need to re-dose which I previously always had to do.<br /><br />Re: Stealth / shipping, it&#039;s equally good. All-around, super high-quality dude who deserves your trust.&nbsp; I have zero concerns about shipping safety with DomesticDude.&nbsp; Also, it arrived within three days of ordering to the East Coast.&nbsp; That speed is waaaay better than other vendors I have used.<br /><br />
