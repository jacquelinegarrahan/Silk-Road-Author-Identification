				So, I&#039;ve been on SR for many months now and have done dozens of transactions but just started posting on the message boards. I wanted to post a review for a new vendor whom I&#039;ve conducted 4 transactions with. This guy is a great vendor for anyone starting out whos looking for some excellent MDMA or M1:<br /><br />M1 for MeGrimlock:<br /><br />This was my first time sampling product from this new vendor. Shipping is quick and arrived in a matter of days from Canada to the US. Lets face it- Canadian vendors don&#039;t have the best reputation and I usually prefer to order domestically. Any lingering doubts immediately vanished once I took delivery. The stealth is top notch, I seriously doubt any orders from MeGrimlock will EVER be intercepted by LE. I sampled the Methylone during a concert-filled weekend(duh) and took the time to vary doses and play with the various means of consumption. As a fairly knowledgeable molly consumer I&#039;ve seen everything from crappy cut rolls to direct from NASA laboratory heat. As most of you (should) know, most of the time you get MDMA in the US it is some form of M1. Some allegedly elitist snobs talk down on M1. But guess what numbnuts- you&#039;re wrong about what you think you know so well. M1 is slightly less potent than pure MDMA but the feeling is the exact same. If you want a seriously deep roll, just up the dose of M1 slightly and you&#039;ll be chewing your lip off in no-time. Like if you usually roll hard off of 120-140mg of MDMA and want the same from the M1, you should dose out around 180-200 (and please, dear god- don&#039;t try n be a hero, work your way up from much smaller doses to gauge how your body reacts.) (note: one of my veteran party brothers ate a tiny shard of crystal and was blown away by the effect it had on him.) Here&#039;s the crucial part though- M1 doesn&#039;t mess with your body/serotonin nearly as bad as MDMA. MDMA gives you a bit of a body hangover and some depressive side effects, all of which increase based on consumption of larger quantities. Most people probably don&#039;t go as hard as I do sometimes so, again know your limits before you try what I did over a 3 day period; but I did consume around 450-550 mgs through that time. Just like anything else, there can be diminishing effects but the point is; after rolling my ass off off and on for 3 days, there were barely any bad side effects to speak of. So, this M1 is about as good as any straight MDMA without all the shitty side effects. I will be using this M1 from now on instead of MDMA. Its fucked up to say but its all the same awesomeness, without the consequences. Based on dosage and means of ingestion it is a medium-quick come up which transitions into a very smooth and controllable high. It is a fucking blast and then if your tired or over it- you can go right to sleep. No ecstasy crack-head insomnia bullshit. You can literally eat a bunch and roll over and go to sleep immediately(idk why you&#039;d want to but sometimes its nice to be able to back out if necessary. This is the cleanest, labgrade molly I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s milkey glass-shard crystals which tested in the high 90s for purity. Plus, anything sold in pure powder form should always be questioned- you cant really add cuts to crystals but its awfully easy to do with powdered products.<br /><br />So, overall MeGrimlock is a great new vendor. Superior communication skills. Excellent stealth and delivery speed. And, by far the best M1 on the road and possibly the world(I shit you not!) Jeez, are you still reading this? go ahead and click &#039;add to cart&#039; and go ahead and order 2x what you thought you&#039;d get. Trust me, it&#039;ll save you some time and money because you WILL be back ordering more, just like I did! Big ups to MeGrimlock- an awesome new vendor who is quickly becoming widely trusted and providing some of the MOST QUALITY GEAR available. Salute this new SR HERO and add him to your favorites list. Hmmmmm, maybe just one most finger dip....... <br /><br />-Moocow2891<br /><br />Recent purchasing statistics<br /><br />Total transactions: 25<br />Total spent: $1858.37<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 9 months
