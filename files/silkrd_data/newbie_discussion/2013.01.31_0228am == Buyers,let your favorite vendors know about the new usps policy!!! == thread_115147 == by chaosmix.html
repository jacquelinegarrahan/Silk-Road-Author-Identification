				I had sent a message to a guy i bought some shrooms for bcuz he is new and i just wanted to make sure that he was aware of the new usps policy regarding tracking and dcns, he sent me a message saying what new policy,i thought they were only changing prices. so i guided him to the shipping forums page so he could check it out for himself/herself. let your people know about this before you place an order with them unless they have it posted on their homepage that they already know about it.

				As buyers we should have our own set of policies and right now until everyone works out the kinks in what is and isn&#039;t in these new shipping rules. Vendors who don&#039;t even make mention of it don&#039;t get business until they can verify they have everything back under control and mention it on their profile.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t to strong arm them into doing something we think they should, but it is for their protection as well as ours. It would suck very badly for vendors to become compromised over a sudden shift in USPS policy on a very random day at that. Don&#039;t rates and changes usually happen on or around Jan 1st?

				Im not sure about the jan1st rule but i am susp about that before monday i havent heard anything about the green dcns not being able to be used and that if you wanted tracking you would have to go into the post office itself or pay online. it seems as though they might have been hoping a bunch of people would trip up this week. i got orders i placed last thurs and this sun that havent got in yet. the thurs one though usually takes about a week and a half,however i plan on reporting any packages not arriving and urge vendors to let us know if they find out that any green dcn packages in blue boxs on monday morning were attempted to be returned to sender. especially if they use a fake address.
