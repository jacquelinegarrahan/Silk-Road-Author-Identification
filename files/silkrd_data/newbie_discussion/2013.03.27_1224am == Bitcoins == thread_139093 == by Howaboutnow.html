				Hey everyone,<br /><br />New to SR and it&#039;s pretty dam cool!<br /><br />I have a proposal for the road.<br /><br />I&#039;m in the financial field and looking to start a bitcoin day trading business.<br /><br />I would&#039;nt mind partnering up with a vendor here on SR to get cash/trade/sell for your coins.<br /><br />If you have extra coins or want to sell your coins just post on this forum how to contact you.&nbsp; We will go from there!<br /><br />I know I&#039;m new but you have to start somewhere right?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks

				Because this sounds legit....<br /><br />Your best bet is to head over to bitcointalk and read up over there. <br /><br />By asking to &quot;partner&quot; with a vendor all you&#039;re really doing is inviting suspicion Mr.LEO amirite?<br /><br />If you&#039;re serious about it work out a decent business model, go buy some btc from mt.gox and leave to accrue value while you&#039;re having your site built. Once that&#039;s done you&#039;ll have people buying and selling from you although business may be slow to start.&nbsp;

I think your best bet would probably be to become accustomed to working as a Bitcoin trader, which would also give vendors an opportunity to get to know you. You can register on localbitcoins.com and other similar sites to accept payment by cash/wire transfer for BTC. If you have the funds to spare you can also set up an SR seller account and offer the service direct to buyers - don&#039;t let the fact that there are others doing this put you off, you can establish a niche by accepting payment methods they don&#039;t or operating in an area others don&#039;t as I did with the UK (at the time!).<br /><br />You will reach a stage where you will need Bitcoins in large quantities and will have to approach vendors directly. In the mean time, I suggest you do as the other poster said and try to build up a good rep doing small sales. If you need any more info or help getting started, let me know.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.
