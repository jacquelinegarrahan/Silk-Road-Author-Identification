				What are the &quot;many secret Tor sidechannel attacks via an exit node&quot; as referenced by SteveTX here?<br />http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=228869 *Clearnet link*<br /><br />He also goes on to say, &quot;Tor is vulnerable to evil exit nodes, which can read your traffic and inject malicious code into it.&quot;<br /><br />Does this SteveTX know what he&#039;s talking about?<br /><br />Tor is supposedly encrypted end-to-end? If yes, then you&#039;re protected right? If yes, what does he mean when he says, &quot;...nobody can encrypt to your final destination for you, especially if you destination doesn&#039;t support encryption.&quot;<br /><br />Finally a person asks, &quot;Does end-to-end encryption = anonymity? Contents transmitted is encrypted from one end to the other. But, is it anonymous? For example, can the ISP or those who intercept your connection know your real IP?&quot;<br /><br />Then SteveTX replies, &quot;Wow. Great questions. NO. encryption != anonymity. encryption == content obfuscation, anonymity == context obfuscation. If I send you an encrypted message, you know it was me who sent it. Other people can&#039;t read it, but they can see who sent it. The content of the letter is a secret, but not the context of who sent it and under what circumstances. If I send you a plaintext message anonymously, anyone can read it, but they don&#039;t know who sent it, and neither do you. The content of the letter is not a secret, but who sent it and under what circumstances is a secret.&quot;<br /><br />So does that mean my plain text passwords and login details can be read from the Tor exit nodes with special tools but that the person reading will not know who I am? In other words, Tor protects the sender from being known but not the content of what&#039;s being sent (in regard to plain text passwords and login data)? <br /><br />
