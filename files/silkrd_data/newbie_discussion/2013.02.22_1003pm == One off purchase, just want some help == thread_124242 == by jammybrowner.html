				Alright, so this is the first time i&#039;ve been on here, and just want to buy a small amount of weed to see if this works.<br /><br />What is confusing me is the bitcoins. I&#039;ve just made an account on mygox.com as you guys recommended. Would it be okay to use my full details there, and transfer it on my SR account? Also i&#039;m not entirely sure how to encrypt my home address.<br /><br />If any of you could give me some bullet points of what to do, I would be grateful. <br /><br />Cheers

				really on mygox.com or typo?<br /><br />SR has it&#039;s own tumbler to obscure the transactions. should be enough for your needs.<br />for how to encrypt the adress, see the newbie-pgp thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0

				Oh I just figured that&#039;s where you buy bitcoins. I&#039;m guessing i&#039;m wrong - so where do I buy bitcoins to put into my SR account?

				I&#039;ve actually found the Blue Sky Traders or Bitcopia are MUCH better and don&#039;t ask for all that scary personal info :)<br /><br />Seems like a lot of people on SR use these sites as well with a lot of success.<br /><br />Check the links :<br /><br />Bitcopia : https://www.bitcopia.com/buy.php<br /><br />Blue Sky: http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />Good luck and welcome to SR!!

				You can also check this list for buying coins:&nbsp; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins<br />It also depends on your country and bank what the best option is

				Oh I live in the UK if that helps. I was trying to see if I could use bitinstant.com at first, but it doesn&#039;t appear to have a UK version. Ahh this is so much effort, I hope it will be worth it.

				It will be worth it.<br />Effort is also necessary, you have to understand what you are doing here so take your time, read the bitcoinwiki and tutorials on SR

				Okay i&#039;ve just read up about the bitcoin-info.<br /><br />It&#039;s told me as I live in the UK, I should use blockchain and make a bank transfer. Once i&#039;ve made the purchase, it will be in my wallet. I&#039;m guessing then I just need to transfer it onto my SR account, and the money should be in my account.<br /><br />Then I will need to encrypt my home address, and then process.<br /><br />Is this right, or have I made any errors?
