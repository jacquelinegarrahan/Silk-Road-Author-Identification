				The article is actually a good proof that the Silk Road system works, since the actual purchase transaction worked fine! It is more of interesting stuff to whether and to what extent Bitcoin transactions ensure full privacy. <br /><br />It also shows that the financial press takes Bitcoin seriously.<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/<br /><br />Happy to learn the community view on the Bitcoin privacy issue

				I ended up using Coinbase for my first few transactions. Now I&#039;m wondering if I should either switch to a client-side wallet, send my funds to SR through Bitlaundry or similar, or both.&nbsp; Thoughts or recommendations?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve been reading threads on buying BTC with prepaid debit or MoneyPak cards. That would break any chain that could lead back to a named bank account in the first place. Any success with either method?

				Did not know that blockchain.info had an automatic build-in tumbler? Mainly the forums talk about a 1.5% fee to mix the Bitcoins, which was reduced .5% at the beginning of March this year (see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=143539.40)

				Also did not find anything on Blockchain.info website except this:<br /><br />Anonymity <br />•Fully Encrypted Wallets - All wallets are fully encrypted client side mean we cannot view your transactions or wallet balance.<br />•Coin Control - Choose specific addresses to send from and where change should be returned.<br />•Group Addresses by taint<br /><br />Maybe it is the last point, don&#039;t know what that means

				Thanks for the Blockchain.info suggestion, they seem to have made some engineering decisions that could help in case of a successful warrant or subpoena. Though some of the recent secure email service shutdowns aren&#039;t reassuring in that regard.&nbsp; Also downloaded MultiBit, figuring maybe better yet just have a client side solution if I don&#039;t want to get caught in a dragnet caused by a compromised third-party.

				1) The article itself gets a lot of traction; Twitter is full of it. The only competing topic is that Chinese President Xi Jinping proposes reviving Silk Road glory ))<br /><br />2) Re Bitcoin and Blockchain.info --- guess the best is to diversify wallets (local, web-based, exchanges). Any centralized organization will be subject - sooner or later - to government scrutiny - and then ...

				Bump.&nbsp; Keep up the plausible deniability by at least using a middleman wallet. Kills your trail.&nbsp; Better yet...wash those coin.
