				AdderallDoc didn&#039;t scam me the first time...<br /><br />But recently I put in a second order...&nbsp; 2 BITCOINS WORTH...&nbsp; (do the math)<br /><br />He sent it out on the 23rd of September...&nbsp; Now he&#039;s unresponsive..<br /><br />It&#039;s been over a week, and the shipment is going from one state to the next state over... not a long distance...<br /><br />And I have not received it...&nbsp; I wasted 2 bitcoins...<br /><br />What can I do?&nbsp; Is there anything I can do?&nbsp; No way to get a refund?&nbsp; I&#039;m still holding out, in hopes that it&#039;ll arrive.&nbsp; But if it doesn&#039;t, that&#039;ll probably be my last SR order.<br /><br />He came through once before, back in July.. but now, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; He was in stealth mode, but now when you go to his user profile, you can only send him a message, which i get no response, in the past 3 days.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9d35859a19/&nbsp; &lt;-&nbsp; That&#039;s his user profile.<br /><br />
