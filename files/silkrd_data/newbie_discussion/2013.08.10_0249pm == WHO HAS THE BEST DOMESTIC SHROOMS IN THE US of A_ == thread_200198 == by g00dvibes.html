				I&#039;m currently in communication with TheFunGuy for a grassy/shroomy custom order. He&#039;s a newish vendor, but has been incredibly helpful and is reasonably priced. I&#039;ll be posting a transaction and product review on him after I get the shrooms and get to 50 posts on here. His shrooms are in .5g capsules and will be really nice for dosing out for lemon tek.

				I think it should be noted that cubensis mushrooms are not like cannabis. There are numerous strains of cannabis with varying potency and effect. From my experience, almost all cubensis have the same potency and effect except for Penis Envy. Penis Envy is a potent motherfucker.

				Strain doesn&#039;t really matter actually. Some strains of mushrooms are SLIGHTLY more potent than others, but it is a very slim difference. What really matters is how well the vendor takes care of his mushrooms, how they are packaged, how old they are, how well they are dried, and other handling variables. Poorly handled mushrooms will give you less psychedelic effects and food poisoning.

				Jr. Mycologist here. I&#039;ve been growing mushrooms on and off for over 12 years and just thought I&#039;d weigh in.<br />If you&#039;ve never grown &#039;shrooms... YOU SHOULD! It&#039;s so super easy that it&#039;s almost idiot-proof (note I said &#039;almost&#039;). With less than $50 in supplies, you can grow Magic Mushrooms using the PFTek. If you already own a pressure cooker, then you&#039;re all set. Seriously, it&#039;s just slightly more complicated than preserving fruit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200198.msg1439551#msg1439551">Quote from: Jack Shit on August 11, 2013, 08:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think it should be noted that cubensis mushrooms are not like cannabis. There are numerous strains of cannabis with varying potency and effect. From my experience, almost all cubensis have the same potency and effect except for Penis Envy. Penis Envy is a potent motherfucker.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is true. There&#039;s a saying on the Shroomery, &quot;A cube is a cube&quot;... meaning Psilocybe Cubensis, which is the mushroom people think of when you say &#039;Magic Mushroom&#039;. With very little derivation all Cubensis contain similar levels of psilicybin and psilocin (the active compounds).<br />I haven&#039;t grown PE yet, but I might be looking at that strain next. I&#039;m currently growing the Koh Samui ET strain, and they&#039;re small little dense balls with barely any stem... tiny round &#039;shrooms with lots of aborts... and therefore they are also very potent. I&#039;m quite the experienced psilonaut, and my confortable &#039;I-can-still-function-if-I-need-to&#039; dose is about 2 to 2.5 grams dried. That&#039;s plenty.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200198.msg1439695#msg1439695">Quote from: cyberscour on August 11, 2013, 08:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Strain doesn&#039;t really matter actually.

Poorly handled mushrooms will give you less psychedelic effects and food poisoning.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>^ THIS!<br />It&#039;s all true. &#039;Shrooms need to be completely dried to a 99.9%+ dehumidified cracker-crunch state using a method that does not employ excessive heat, as heat destroys psilocybin. How much heat is apparently still debated (I can&#039;t find a clear answer), but using a heat-variable food dehydrater on the lowest setting is reported to provide good results. I use first a fan, and then a small dessication chamber instead to achieve this state at room temperature. For larger amounts I use a cheap box\floor fan, a few cellulose furnace filters, and a couple of bungie cords. That setup can render ounces of dried &#039;shrooms to a 95% state in just 24 hours. Makes the whole place smell like fresh &#039;shrooms for the first couple of hours... nice.<br /><br />Here, the difference between psilocybin and psilocin should be noted:<br />* Psilocin is the active compound in Magic Mushrooms. It&#039;s what makes you trip.<br />* Psilocin is a rather volatile compound and degrades quickly. Even if carefully dried, this stuff will be gone with weeks or months if stored at room temperature.<br /><br />* Psilocybin rapidly metabolizes into psilocin in the liver, at a rate of about 72%.<br />* Psilocybin is found in P. Cubensis at about 4x the concentration of psilocin (around 0.4% dry weight).<br />* Psilocybin is a tryptamine (like DMT). Much like Phenethylamines (MDMA; Mescaline) these are considered highly stable compounds and should last for years if stored in a cool, dark, dry place.<br /><br />This is why fresh &#039;shrooms are more potent than dried &#039;shrooms (by maybe 20-30%). You&#039;d really have to get into freeze-drying if you want to preserve the psilocin content.<br />Oh, and about food poisoning, that&#039;s no joke. If your &#039;shrooms aren&#039;t snap-cracker dry and stored in an air-tight container, the moisture will harbor the growth of who-knows-what. Dry &#039;em and store &#039;em carefully.<br /><br />Now, to the question of which is the strongest. That would be one of the wood-loving non-cubensis varieties of Psilocybe, such as Cyanescens or Azurescens. they clock in at around 2-3x more potent than Cubensis. See here: https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_info9.shtml<br /><br />And then there&#039;s the sclerotia producing species like P. Galandoi. they&#039;re even easier to grow because you never have to fruit it. Can some grain, inoculate with a syringe, wait 2-3 months and presto, Magic Mushrooms! The sclerotia are about 200% as potent fresh, and about 66% as potent dried as P. Cubensis. that&#039;s because the carpophores (normal fruiting bodies; ie. mushrooms) are about 90% water by weight, and the sclerotia are about 70%.<br /><br />For more info I invite you to visit the Shroomery (.org). It&#039;s really an interesting, inexpensive and rather rewarding hobby to acquire.

				&nbsp; First off, most of you sound absolutely RETARDED.&nbsp; Never goto Shroomery or any other of those stupid sites which claim to have superior knowledge about shrooms....most of the people on that site wouldn&#039;t know their asses from a hole in the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp; You all need to be set straight on a few things.&nbsp; ALL CUBES ARE NOT THE SAME!.&nbsp; One of you peetards mentioned above that there&#039;s only a slight difference between say a PES Hawaiian Cube and a Burma Cube etc....nothing could be further from the truth and it makes you look stupid to say such crap.&nbsp; One tool even said that all cubes are the same except for Penis Envy... what a redundant bunch of word vomit.&nbsp; If a cube is a cube....an PE is a cube....than how is it suddenly more potent.&nbsp; Just do yourself a favor and don&#039;t speak about things you obviously know NOTHING about.<br /><br />&nbsp; I have been a Mycologist for over a decade and a cube is definitely NOT a cube.&nbsp; There are so many variables when cultivating strains that the alkaloid contents from one grow to another can be light years apart.&nbsp; I will give some examples of why:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; If you order a spore print/syringe from a vendor, you are starting with &quot;multi-spore&quot;.&nbsp; That means there is no way to tell what the end result will be.&nbsp; You could get large fruits, you could get many aborts, you could get tall skinny ones....the list is endless.&nbsp; The point of growing is to find that ONE SHROOM out of the bunch that is the best as far as size, speed of growth, ability to fight off pests/disease. <br /><br />&nbsp; Then you clone that cube and make either a liquid culture using its flesh or using AGAR to grow on petri dishes.&nbsp; When you have done all of that, it&#039;s time to test the potency to see if the clones are worthwhile or not.&nbsp; If not, you continue using multispore until you hit that magical blend of great grower and high potency.<br /><br />&nbsp; Furthermore, potency can vary by leaps and bounds depending on what you are using to grow on.&nbsp; For instance, if you are just using plain birdseed (millet, winter wheat, rye berries) and then just casing with vermiculite, you will suffer horribly on potency.&nbsp; Probably like 1.2-1.6% by volume.<br /><br />If you use that same birdseed and then spawn it to straw and fruit, your size of fruitbodies AND potency will be far better...more like 2%.&nbsp; Take that same scenario and then add in some horse poop, you can easily get a potency of 2.3+.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people, such as myself, also add straight tryptamine to the process and my fruits test at 5% alkaloid content every time.<br /><br />Please people, quit muddying the waters with asinine statements that all cubes are the same, because nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />As to who has the best cubes....well, I can gaurantee that no vendor on SR has them.&nbsp; The best cubes are grown for personal use only and selling them for profit will just get you a class B felony, which is not worth it considering that is the same charge as manslaughter in all 50 states.<br /><br />God you fucking people are stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever you do, do not listen to the jack-wagons at shroomery.&nbsp; Most of them don&#039;t know their asses from a hole in the ground.&nbsp; Besides, everyone on those sites think Roger Rabbit is a God...even after I put that ass clown in his place numerous times as well as that whore Hippie3.&nbsp; Cops are all over those sites so watch yerselves.

Some strains of mushrooms are SLIGHTLY more potent than others, but it is a very slim difference. What really matters is how well the vendor takes care of his mushrooms, how they are packaged, how old they are, how well they are dried, and other handling variables. Poorly handled mushrooms will give you less psychedelic effects and food poisoning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Strain actually DOES matter.&nbsp; If you have a Trich problem, you will not want to grow cube strains that are succeptible to it such as Mazatapec and Hawaiian.&nbsp; You would want to grow Burma or Vietnamese which defend against Trich better.<br /><br />If you have a nat problem, you wouldn&#039;t want to grow PE, you would want the PES Hawaiian as this strain emits a slightly different odor which pesty nats do not seem to like.<br /><br />Saying all strains are the same is like saying all human beings are the same.....it just sounds stupid and goes a long way to showing that if you don&#039;t know wtf you are talking about, you should stay out of the conversation.<br /><br />Packaging and drying have absolutely NOTHING to do with potency or anything else.&nbsp; If you cool dry by fan, you will be no better off than if you use dessicant or vice versa.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter if you vacuum seal or put it in a ziplock.&nbsp; Nothing at all matters besides what the shrooms were grown on, period.<br /><br />If you ask a vendor, they&#039;ll probably tell you what medium they used.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t opt for anything that wasn&#039;t grown on either horse poop or hippo poop, otherwise you&#039;re wasting your cash.

				I know its not in the USA, but he/she is in canada, great product and the stealth would clear customs in a bloody heartbeat, an agent could look at the product directly and let it go through, I wont give it away of course.

				A friend and I split a 1.4 oz of mushroomgirl&#039;s P. cubensis. ~3.6 grams and I had an intense 4-5 hour trip with a lot of visuals. Felt a warm buzz the next day. 2.5 gram would have made for a mellow trip probably.

				cyanspore&#039;s Psilocybe cyanescens were pretty potent, as described. .5 gm felt the same as ~2 gm of P. cubensis to me.
