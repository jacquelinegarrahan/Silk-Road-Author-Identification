				Hello guys,<br /><br />2CB in a gel cap needs obviously too long to get dissolved in my stomach.<br />Can I wrap the powder in rizla/toilet paper and parachute it the same way you do while doing MDMA?<br /><br />And what is the approximate time of 2CB effects? 6-8 hours all together with coming down and after effects? or longer?<br /><br />the question is : if I take it lets say at 7pm, would I be able to fall asleep after it?<br /><br />thats it, guys<br /><br />nice sunday to all of you ))<br /><br />

				Hey OP. Fastest way is to snort it if its powder. You can parachute like mdma too.<br /><br />Duration is usually around 5-6 hrs with a couple hours after effects. I like around 25 mg orally for my sweet spot. Good visuals at this level.

				<br />&nbsp; What&#039;s too long for you op? 2cb in a gel cap should really only take about half an hour, 45 mins, for strong effects, another half to reach plateau, with usually around 3-5 hours of serious tripping. Bombing it in a paper is a good way to go when you&#039;ve just got the powdered product. I&#039;ve gone that route 2 out of the 3 times I&#039;ve used 2cb. It doesn&#039;t come on that much faster than my estimates above, you&#039;ll definitely be full bore in an hour.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2cb insufflated is a serious bitch on your nose, and it hits hard and fast. Really fast! Admittedly I&#039;m no hardcore psychonaut, but I found 20mg of 2cb insufflated an over the top experience. Not hellish, but certainly not pleasant.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you enjoy your trip, however you do it! If you haven&#039;t already, next time try some 2ci, I love that shit. Apart from Ketamine (I consider it a psychedelicesque drug), it&#039;s really the only psychedelic I take anymore :)

				Hi!<br />I also find 2cb in gel caps to take a bit long to come up. You can also just throw it in water and drink it, it&#039;s a bit bitter but not that bad. For me the duration of the effects are never that long, I guess 4 hours max. Also the effects come in waves: you may think you are back to normal, only to be tripping hard again several seconds later. Part of the fun :-) . I also feel it&#039;s easy to be &#039;distracted&#039; from the 2cb; I have been having conversations while on 2cb where I hardly noticed the effects while I was talking, but as soon as I was alone (going to the toilet, looking at my phone, etc) I realized how hard I was tripping. <br />I never had any problems falling asleep after 2cb, it&#039;s actually quite nice to lie in bed with some closed-eyed-visuals. 2cb is stimulating but not so much in a physical sense (and no jaw clenching)<br />Finding your ideal dose it a bit tricky. 20 mg is my dose for going out to a bar (I don&#039;t drink alcohol, but 2cb works well for me when going out with people who do), 25 mg is my dose for clubbing. And 30 mg was way too much (as in needing a good friend with me, which I had, so no problem).<br /><br />And while 2cb is really nice on itself, I love to combine it with MDMA or methylone.
