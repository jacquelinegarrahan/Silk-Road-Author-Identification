Where as adderall or vyvanse will carry you through a whole day of work np (unless you take it a lot!)

				At work? Come on man. You should know better than that. Blow can be a work drug but molly isn&#039;t. I&#039;d suggest you wait. MDMA is something that should be enjoyed in the correct dose in the right setting. I know it&#039;s tempting but you&#039;d be wasting a beautiful substance.

Very bad idea!<br />For one, taking small amounts is a waste. May as well have a proper dose. Also you will get ridiculously social and your eyes will dilate and it will be obvious you will be on drugs.<br />And taking MDMA at work is a waste. Take it somewhere where you can enjoy it. At home with friends, a party, music festival. Anywhere but work! It is easier to control yourself on amphetamine or cocaine than MDMA. <br /><br />Have some Amphetamine at work. It&#039;ll make you in a good mood and make you more productive and a bit more talkative, and people won&#039;t even realise you&#039;ve had anything.<br />

				Definitely not. You&#039;ll stand out like a sore thumb. Even with small amounts, the pupil dilation is noticeable as well as all the other side effects.

				Like everyone else, I would say don&#039;t do it. If it&#039;s pure MDMA, even a small amount can affect you. I remember recently I fucked up measuring some and had a few powdery bits left where I was preparing them, so I just licked it off the table. This was about 2 hours before I was due to take my actual dose for that night, but that tiny bit made me excited, sociable, energetic, happy, etc. Those 2 hours seemed like a lifetime to me. I was so desperate to leave and go to the rave. I just wanted to dance etc. and none of my friends were feeling that way. But I probably took less than 20mg. It wasn&#039;t a full roll but I was most definitely feeling it (this to me also showed that it was very good molly and it was... that night was awesome).<br />

				Don&#039;t do it you&#039;ll be obvious with your jaw swinging all over the place. Coke, speed or even weed would be better to take at work.<br /><br />I had a couple of E&#039;s in work once too. We were having a work&#039;s night out the same evening and in the pub that lunch time I&#039;d had a couple of pints when my mate passed me a bag of pills. I knew we were required to go back to work for another half an hour before we were allowed to return to the pub again, but knowing it was only 30 mins the temptation to drop a couple was just too great. I did so and ended up coming up pretty hard once back in work. So.much so that I had to go and sit it out in the toilets until we ould leave again. I wouldn&#039;t do it again.

				I&#039;ve done a few days here and there with a rec drug in my system, sometimes it works out good, sometimes I just want to leave. If you think you can handle someone saying; &quot;man your in a great mood today, something going on?&quot; and they give you the drug-eye. As long as you can say with a straight face; &quot;its all good, I&#039;m stone cold normal, just feeling good&quot; your good. If you hug him/her and start laughing, just leave.

				I&#039;ve done MDMA well over 50 times, and I&#039;d never even THINK of doing it at work. And I&#039;m the sort who can rail back an entire gram of pure in a night. (NEVER do that by the way. In some people, that amount IS lethal.)<br /><br />Don&#039;t do it at work. Just don&#039;t. There isn&#039;t a good reason to. And if you&#039;ve ever experienced mdma before, you wouldn&#039;t even be asking the question as to whether or not you should be doing it at work.<br /><br />Find a quiet spot you can be alone in for at least 6 hours. Maybe on one of your days off, you can go sit in a park somewhere and be out in nature. Or heck, you can even just wander around a mall for awhile. I&#039;d say that you should find a good friend to do it with, but unless they are on it too, they might not appreciate your hyperactive company. *winks*<br /><br />My best experiences with mdma have been when I have an entire day to myself, and I do it with my absolute best friend in the entire world. The drug can be a very useful tool. And that is how you should view all drugs: as a tool. Treat them with respect. If you&#039;ve never operated a band-saw before, you need to first do some research into how to operate one safely without losing a finger on an eye. If you&#039;re prepared for using the tool, and you have an idea of what you want to build, you will have a safe and fantastic experience. But if you use a tool without knowing how it works, or use it haphazardly, you increase your risk of injury.<br /><br />Go to erowid.org, look up mdma, and read. Read read read. Read what the chemical is, and what it does. Read experiences from people who have done it before, both good, and bad. Don&#039;t let the bad frighten you, but neither let the good make you over confident. Take the information available to you, know what to expect, and be excited when you finally take it in a safe, controlled environment, knowing that you&#039;re about to have a wonderful experience.<br /><br />If you have never driven a car, should you get in one and pull out onto the freeway? No. However, driving around slowly in a parking lot for awhile is a safe way to get used to the experience. Always treat drugs with that very same respect. Always. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
