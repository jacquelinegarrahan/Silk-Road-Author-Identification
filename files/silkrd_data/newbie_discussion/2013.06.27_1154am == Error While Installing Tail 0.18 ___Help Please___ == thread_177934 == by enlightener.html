				It is possible a part of your hardware just isn&#039;t compatible with Linux, try it on another machine if possible.<br />Also possible the disc didn&#039;t burn properly or there is a scratch on it.

				Wow.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty impressive... it&#039;s awfully hard to get a kernel panic these days.&nbsp; Basically that means the kernel -- which is what talks to the hardware and stuff -- ran into a situation it not only can&#039;t handle, but can&#039;t even continue functioning properly because of.&nbsp; Hence &quot;panic.&quot;&nbsp; It just dies right there.<br /><br />Sittort&#039;s probably right.&nbsp; It sounds to me like the kernel Tails is using doesn&#039;t include one of the drivers necessary for your machine, or it does include an obscure driver that&#039;s so buggy it&#039;s fucking up the entire kernel.&nbsp; It&#039;s really hard to say any more without seeing the messages leading up to the panic.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how to get a boot prompt with Tails... normally at the GRUB or LILO boot menu I believe you hit &quot;tab&quot; and it lets you explicitly specify the boot line to use.&nbsp; You can google it and try making the line this to see if it works, or just one of them if both don&#039;t work:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">boot &lt;something&gt; acpi=off pnpbios=off<br /></code><br />(the &lt;something&gt; should be filled in automatically when you get to the boot prompt... hopefully anyway, it&#039;s been awhile since I did this, ahem)<br />That&#039;s not really ideal, but hopefully it&#039;ll let you boot.&nbsp; Basically the problem is that the kernel doesn&#039;t know how to deal with your hardware, and that&#039;s not going to change anytime soon, so... you may want to try an older version of Tails or email the maintainer about it.

				thanks for the advice Sittort and SelfSovereignty<br /><br />I dont think it could be a faulty dvd as I made three copies and the same error was thrown each time<br /><br />I will try booting from another machine to check if I am having hardware issues with the burner<br /><br />@SelfSovereignty, I did type the code you suggested during the boot process but had no luck,thanks for the suggestion<br /><br />will report back on how things turn out, could be useful to someone else too if I do succeed&nbsp; :)<br /><br />love n light

				wanted to bump this thread if any new users faced similar problems<br /><br />yes the error was due the fact that my firmware had not been updated and apparently there are not going to be any,therefore DVD-USB is not a feasible option<br /><br />However USB-USB installation worked perfect without any flaws<br /><br />heres the tutorial link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0<br /><br />love n light
