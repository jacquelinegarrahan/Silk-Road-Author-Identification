				I am very new to SR. This is my first day posting in the forums and I have been browsing SR for about a month trying to get my nut up and make a purchase probably Meth been off for ten years and do not know anyone who sells anymore.<br /><br />Should I use my real name and address? I have read that it is safer (in the US) because it will not raise any red flags. But on the other hand if something goes wrong then the law will know where you live.<br /><br />It is difficult for me to get a PO box or anything because of my disability. It also sucks because you can&#039;t really ask specifically how others do thing in case LE is listening in (I think LE is law enforcement, I am still trying to learn the acronyms)<br /><br />Also I have read where vendors got pissed at buyers threatening to release their names and addresses to LE. It is bad enough teens are posting pictures of what they buy here (which is how I found about the SR in the first place0<br /><br />To anyone responding do you use you real address or not? It would be nice to know the percentage so I could decide but i do not want anyone to answer anything they are not comfortable with for safety concerns.<br /><br />Thanks<br />

				It&#039;s always best to use your real name and address. The government can&#039;t really make a case against you because anyone can ship anything to any address (literally). Just don&#039;t sign for anything or fall for anything that requires you to come pick something up. Also try and stick to ordering from vendors within your country (which I assume is the US.) Good luck and enjoy!

				Thanks.. Worrying about receiving packages is the only thing that has prevented me from ordering. If this was legal I would&nbsp; buy everything!

				I was quite apprehensive. My first order was from a vendor in the &gt;30%, and legal. Payed me well to go slow, up to now.

				Everyone has their own preferences.&nbsp; Personally, I like to use either my own address or po box with a business name on it, or send it to a friends place and put a business name on it.&nbsp; This way, if you get a slip on your door to pick it up at the post office, you can always use the &quot;I wasnt expecting anything.....I just got a slip saying I missed a package&quot;, if LE decides to be there waiting for you.&nbsp; But if your name is on it...it&#039;s kind of difficult to use that excuse when the name on your ID matches the name on the package (sure...someone other than you could have sent a package to your name but REALLY?&nbsp; Rare. Much more likely to send to the wrong address by messing up the numbers accidentally).&nbsp; I like the real address / fake name or business name method.&nbsp; But it&#039;s all what you&#039;re comfortable with that you should do.

You just come up with a random business name and write your real address? Will usps still deliver/leave it at your door? Would that work in apt building?

				I think I will use my real name/real address or maybe better yet use CURRENT RESIDENT as the name. I heard a fake name could cause red flag especially if the postman has been on your route for a long time and only two names have ever been at the address. Someone said to test mail yourself something with a fake name and see what happens. <br /><br />To Jaybullz: I have read the wiki and much of the forum on security and shipping. I was just asking a honest question to see what some other newbies are currently doing. What I don&#039;t need is some snotty ass comment telling me something I already know

				I have never had a problem with delivery using my real address and business name.&nbsp; And then I have any one of my &quot;receivers&quot; go pick it up at the post office if a slip is left.&nbsp; Been doing this for a looooong time.&nbsp; Over a decade.&nbsp; And yes it works in apartment buildings, my receivers have all lived in apartments.&nbsp; The only issue is if your vendor gets the address wrong.&nbsp; Then things can get a little tricky, because you have to go to the post office and pick it up with your tracking number if it says a slip was left, meaning that you were looking for a package vs a slip being left at YOUR address and you going to pick it up with the slip, saying you were NOT expecting a package, if anyone questions you.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s rare to have anything go wrong though where they do a controlled delivery.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had numerous letters sent from US customs, but never a controlled delivery in over 10 years.&nbsp;
