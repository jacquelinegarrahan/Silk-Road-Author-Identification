				hello, I heard about the SR a year or so ago, the idea sounded cool but I never looked for it or anything. Today I just found this site by accident. I don&#039;t plan on making any purchases or selling anything because I am not in a good position to do so at this time (don&#039;t know much about TOR, bitcoins, encrypting etc.) so I obviously wouldn&#039;t do anything until I am in a good position to do so. However, I can not find the actual site for silk road. I can only go on this forum. How do I get to the actual site?? Do I have to go on the TOR network or whatever? I just want to see what is actually on the Silk Road and compare the prices they have to my hometown. Maybe I will use the Silk Road in a couple years or so when I know what i&#039;m doing and how to do it in a completely safe way. but till then I&#039;d just like to browse.

				Yes you have to use TOR, but how are you reading this?<br />If you read through the forums, say the Rumours board, you will see many SR vendors and they will have the address at the bottom of their post.<br />If you come this far, you may as well find out the rest yourself.
