				I know most of you were probably nervous and didn&#039;t know what to expect, but most likely ended up having a night filled with euphoria, who knew one girl could make so many people happy! My first time with Molly was probably one of the best nights of my life, I went to my first rave on the first of this year, with my ex girlfriend. Up until this point I had only done MDA and didn&#039;t know the difference between the two, but boy, Molly made me feel like a little kid in a candy shop! Everything was just amazing, I took around 300mg, and for a short period, right after the come up started feeling tingling all through out my body and felt really shaky, luckily my ex helped me out and told me to just go sit down and drink water and that what I was experiencing was completely normal, so I did and I sat down for about 30 minutes, and these thirty minutes were amazing, I could literally close my eyes and feel like I was one with the music. After getting up, me and my ex went out into the huge crowd and danced our asses off! I literally had never been that happy in my life until then, which is kind of sad, but oh well, all in all it was an amazing night, and I had a more positive outlook on life and the whole universe since then.<br /><br />So SR, how was your first date with Molly?

				I&#039;ve yet to try Molly but I really want to. I was thinking about doing it with 4 other friends who&#039;ve never done it either at a friends house just chilling and listening to some music but heard people say I should go out and do something.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to a music festival soon and was thinking about doing it there with the same friends who haven&#039;t ever done it either. Now like I said I&#039;ve done molly, do you think we would all be fine doing it at a big music fest with no &quot;sitters&quot;? Such as being able to not get out of control and what not (cuz there will be cops there probably).

If you trust your dealer and have heard from others that it&#039;s good ole molly then by all means do it, and you won&#039;t need a sitter, and as far as cops go, just don&#039;t walk around with anything on you and you&#039;ll be fine, when you enter the venue for the festival, from what I understand you pretty much give up all your rights protecting you from unwarranted searches, so be careful as far as that goes, but if cops walked around festivals looking for people rolling, well let&#039;s just say there wouldn&#039;t be many festivals as 70% of the people would be sitting in jail hahah. Just have fun with it man and if the roll gets to strong and you start getting hardcore eye wiggles just sit down for a bit, drink some water, and vibe to the music, no one will judge you, we&#039;ve all been there, and it only gets better from there.

				Oh man I&#039;d had Methylone and Mephedrone multiple times before I ever really got the real thing, Love 4MMC but BK sucked ass. First got it at a Datsik Concert selling methylone, saw another guy selling went to check his shit. Saw the beautiful amber crystals in the caps and bought em all haha, supplied my whole crew of friends for free, fucking had a great night, We were all so amazing at how much cleaner and better that shit is than Bk. Never touched BK since and the road has been able to enlighten the rest of my friends to know to not buy that white salty looking bullshit

				My first time on MDMA was absolutely amazing, it was most definitely the best I had ever felt in my entire life. Music was amazing, my girlfriend (with whom I was cuddling the whole time) was so amazing, I fell in love with her that night. <br /><br />Damn, I can&#039;t wait to roll again.
