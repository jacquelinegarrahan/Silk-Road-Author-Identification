				Hey everyone, new kid on the block and was wondering if anyone&#039;s used orbot and orweb yet to access sr?<br />I have a friend who just put it on his cell which is NOT rooted. After downloading both he jumped right on without messing with any admin settings or changing anything, download and go pretty much. Should he be worried about anything security wise? (It really is a friend, I have a burner flip lol)

				It&#039;s not advisable to use any kind of mobile browser. There&#039;s been quite a bit of discussion about this topic. Here&#039;s some of the most recent threads:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144018.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=145659.0

				After reading through that stuff (unable to post there as I am a new kid on the block) out seems to me that a rooted pay as you go android set up with the necessary settings using orbot and orweb should be fairly safe. Seems like it would be damn hard to track info on such a device (five-o in mind). Pay for a good mobile security app and it seems like hackers ect would have trouble throwing worms into the device aswell. Staying away from mobile porn probably helps too&nbsp; ::)

				But they can&#039;t see what sites you access on Tor, and simply accessing the tor network can&#039;t possibly be grounds for a flag, not to mention lack of any possibility for gathering evidence.&nbsp; If the FIRST thing they can do is track you because of conspicuous activity then they would have to put constant surveillance on you to gather any evidence whatsoever. Setting as my buddy doesn&#039;t have the means to in a car that requires a payment he won&#039;t be making any large purchases and would be a terrible waste of resources to seize negligible amounts. I might be a newb taking?

				Wow thanks guys, I really appreciate the insight! Not only is the man pretty much allowed to do whatever he wants if they blame terrorists but hell, for all we know with some of these vendors we really could be funding terrorism... can&#039;t really be sure.

				just to add some info really but if you have an iphone you can use Covert Browser or OnionBrowser i use it for business here when away from home, i prefer the onionbrowser personally for its speed but both work well.<br /><br />Maybe both them browsers i mentioned do Android versions ?, go look for some on android LAND : )<br />if u cant find anything like that Program one for android and your onto a winner!.
