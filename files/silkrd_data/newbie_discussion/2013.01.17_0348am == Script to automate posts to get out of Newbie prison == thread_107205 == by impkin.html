				Well I&#039;m not a newbie at all, but since it is now a law of the land to get 50 posts before graduating from kindergarten, ill take the opportunity to give a shout out to my favorite vendor, and all around pretty cool motherfucker, PurpleLotus. Buying his listing is the smartest thing you could do since it will save you money which you could then use to buy more drugs!
