				Hey guys - My curiousity has been super peaked in visuals. I&#039;m a MDxx kind of guy and have stuck with rolls for quite some time (and MJ of course), but after seeing so many awesome sounding experiences for things like shrooms, lsd, etc, I reallly want to at least do it once. My question is, for someone who has never tripped like that before, what would you recommend I start with? Maybe some risk/reward comparison? As well as how much to take of said substance. Any help/info is appreciated.

				Dmt because it doesnt last too long and its by far visually the trippiest in my opinion.&nbsp; shrooms was also trippy but it lasts a lot longer. <br />have fun! :)

				DMT&#039;s a pretty hardcore one to start with in my opinion. Small doses of mushrooms with your friends would be my advice.

				My first psychedelic experience was with magic mushrooms (Psilocybin)<br /><br />They grow in fields locally so you can harvest them yourself for free! (they are usually growing around late September/October here in UK)<br /><br />My first time I only took 12 and about 2 hours later (after I thought nothing was going to happen) I was having mild distortion hallucinations and general giddyness. (was only 15)<br /><br />The thing with hallucinogenics is the emotionally rollercoaster that comes with them, I love the visuals but all your feelings are maximised/exaggerated.<br />So if you find something funny you will laugh until your belly aches, but if something worries you it can turn into fear/paranoia and &quot;thought-loops&quot; can be hard to break out of.<br /><br />If you do go with mushrooms make sure you&#039;re 99.99% sure they are the right kind. Also you can start with a small amount and build up. <br /><br /><br />LSD is the most famous one but there&#039;s no way of knowing how many Micrograms are on a tab and once you start you&#039;re in for at least an 8 hour ride. <br />I&#039;d recommend doing it somewhere safe, at yours or a friends home and have someone you trust with you just to reassure you if things start getting a bit intense.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve not had a chance to try DMT yet, powerful and short lasting.<br /><br /><br />I hope this post wasn&#039;t condescending - just tired and trying to get to 50 posts!

				Yeah DMT seems like itd be ahmazing, but possibly overwhelming for a first timer. Shrooms seem to be the &quot;safest&quot; way to go, fromwhat I can infer. Im not so concerned with length of trip as I am of body load. Dont get me wrong, Ive rolled so hard my eyes lived in the back of my head for a while, but since Ive never done it Im just a little para about how it will effect motor function comprehension etc. Im pretty good with keeping my emotions in check, and make sure Im in the right enviroment. Def dont want to get caught up with anxiety while tripping. Ive read some badddd things about that.

				Buzzing, loved up, rushing, things like that.<br /><br />It depends on how much you take of course, but a little bit just makes things seem a bit unfamiliar and interesting. And wobbly!<br /><br />A lot can blast you into some really vivid hallucinations, but the MDMA keeps you happy and feeling good about it all.

				I took some p. galindoi mushrooms a couple of months back.&nbsp; tea actually.&nbsp; the trip didn&#039;t last nearly as long as the nausea.<br /><br />I consider LSD to be king both for new and experienced users.

				I don&#039;t think a low dose mushroom trip gives you a notable psychedelic experience- especially if you&#039;re after hallucinations- you gotta go over 4 grams for that. <br /><br />I think LSD is perfect for a first timer. The trip will give you better visuals than a low dose mushroom trip and it will be less indimidating than a 4-5 gram shroom trip.

				MESCALINE! It&#039;s very visual at moderate doses and would be a nice transition from MDMA to more more typical psychedelics such as L or Shrooms.

				I recommend having benzos on hand.&nbsp; It is an easy way to abort a bad trip if needed.
