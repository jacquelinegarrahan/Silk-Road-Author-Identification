				Hi, I have some serious confidence issues. Last time i tried to hold a speech in front of my class i had to take heroin to be able to handle it, tho fucked it up anyways because i didn&#039;t have much left and it didn&#039;t give me confidence at all, it just kept me cool until it was my turn :(<br />So I wonder what drug is best for me to use so i can give like speeches and similar in school? I can&#039;t really handle to do them without any drugs. I just fuck them up, doesn&#039;t matter if i studded or not. So i thought cocaine would be best? Idk tho, only tried it once but didn&#039;t feel anything so don&#039;t got any experience with it.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				I might suggest just trying a beta blocker, maybe not as sexy and fun as a recreational drug, but it might be all you need to do the trick and much cheaper.&nbsp; Without giving anything more away, I&#039;ve worked in a performance industry for quite a long time and the first thing to try for people that have issues with nerves is a simple beta blocker.

				Me personally, I&#039;d go with a stimulant like Adderall. You wouldn&#039;t want to take so much that you get fidgety and bug eyed, of course, but just enough to keep you focused, funny, talkative and on point. I second the tequila idea also, maybe a couple hits of pot if you&#039;re into that to counteract the stimulant or even by itself.<br /><br />When I took a speech class and had to give my final speech, I used a big gas station cup and filled it with a cocktail. I&#039;m not suggesting this, it was just really hard for me at the time because the speech was really personal (it was on abortion, speaking from personal experience), and I was a bit of an alcoholic at the time.<br /><br />Seriously though, stimulants in moderate doses do wonders for confidence and charisma.

				Meth: Now hear me out before you start laughing. That first rush off the pipe and you feel more confident, more intelligent and can talk forever about the lamest subject. at least that is how i feel<br /><br />but you got to be careful for if you do too much you will be a blabbering tweaker and it will definitely show. So just a very small amount, but like the other poster stated I would experiment first.<br /><br />

				Xanax and Valium are good choices, because they can make you feel very relaxed and at ease.&nbsp; Adderall may also be an alternative choice, because it can make you feel focused and confident, and it usually makes me pretty relaxed as well.

				I find ROA influences how meth affects me much moreso than other drugs. A toke off the pipe gets me super high but a small line gets me focused without the &quot;party head&quot;

				Last semester I ordered some Nuvigil and Provigil and they didn&#039;t help anxiety for giving speeches. If anything I believe they made it worse. I actually gave away about 50 pills because they were making me more anxious.<br /><br />I ordered the Provigil and Nuvigil as an alternative to my Adderall. It appears stimulants just don&#039;t help me. I could see tequila doing the trick though.

				So i should try meth, benzo, Adderall and i might try beta blocker again?<br /><br />The beta blockers, they only make you calm right?

				Hi feetfloors...<br /><br />I just noticed your post and thought i&#039;d share something which may be beneficial (but more so over time).<br /><br />I too had strong confidence issues like you mentioned. I would be ok amongst family or a small group of very close friends but when in company of bigger groups of people my head used work differently.<br />Like you I was diagnosed with depression but I was also diagnosed with adhd when younger and these two were kinda conflicting in ways.<br /><br />I smoked a lot of weed at the time and didn&#039;t get out as much as I should have so this didn&#039;t help my case but anyhow.<br /><br />A few posts here mention valium and similar alternatives. I would agree that these would help on short notice as you describe. But don&#039;t over do it! See how one works on you one day in your own time and test it first.<br /><br />But this is what I wanted to get to. I don&#039;t know you as a person but I ask you this: Do you do much exercise? Do you spend most of your spare time just on the computer?? Maybe you are insecure about how you look and secretly without you knowing, this may be causing your problems. Exercise release serotonin which in turn will regulate your mood better and sleep amongst other things.<br /><br />I used never exercise at all when I mentioned how I used be the same as you. For the past year I go the gym 3-5 days per week and now I am more confident in everything I do than I have ever been. I can guarantee you that in time you will feel so much more confident.<br /><br />Maybe you already do work out a lot and this may not be your issue but if you don&#039;t, rest assured you will benefit greatly from it.<br /><br />Hope this can help you out in the long run dude.<br /><br />Peace out.

Sometimes it can be hard but people who worry what others think are always gonna be making slow progress in getting on in life...<br /><br />About the way you look. All of us are different in our own very unique ways. Don&#039;t ever be stressing yourself about this because more so than not it will only make you feel worse the more you think about it.<br /><br />I used be very over weight before I started gymming and now am that much more fit and have lost it all... <br /><br />Anybody can do it but the key is to keep saying to yourself that you can. Starting off it seems like an impossible task but as the weeks fly by and each week you notice a slight change the more happier you get and in turn more confidence you have. :)<br /><br />Feel free to pm me if you&#039;d like any help man cos it seems you have such similar issues I have been through not long ago and i&#039;d be more than happy to help in any way possible.<br /><br />Peace

				Modafinil/armodafinil are pretty good for speaking and maybe a beta blocker to take the edge off and control your nerves.

				Depends on your personality/chemical makeup. Some people shine on Adderall, some people just become fast-talking, nervous messes.<br /><br />Probably no drug will help you as much as just plowing forth in public speaking situations over and over until it becomes natural

				What helped my final speech was writing it down and reading that shit over and over for a good 30minutes (or until you memorize it).<br /><br />But if you&#039;re confidence is really low and you mention self esteem issues, I&#039;d try meth.&nbsp; Eat like 10-15mg if you are a first timer.&nbsp; You&#039;ll feel like a superstar and you&#039;ll feel like everyone loves you.

				yeah, a low does of meth was my first instinct. Do too much, and you&#039;ll feel like superman, but everyone will know you&#039;re tweaking. <br /><br />Other alternitives I would use:<br /><br />Xanax. Around .5 to 2mg depending on how familiar you are with it. Takes the edge off. <br /><br />I would prefer opiates. Not enough to nod, but get you in the right frame of mind where you feel confident in yourself to where you could care less what others think. <br /><br />I would go with opiates or meth. Opiates you won&#039;t care what others think, meth you will be highly aware, and quite witty at the same time, it will give the impression people are digging you.<br /><br />Xanax....you won&#039;t really be too aware of what others think either way.
