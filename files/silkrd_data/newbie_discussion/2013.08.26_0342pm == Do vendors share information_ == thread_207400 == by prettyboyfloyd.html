				Sure of course they&#039;re in competition to a certain extent but with a marketplace like this where people specialize in different products, sell through different environments/risks in different countries to customers made a little more uniform through the particularity of SR access, site architecture, rules and regs etc I&#039;m curious.<br /><br />Do they share views and opinions on buyers and newbie entrants? On stealth? Maybe on sources sometimes? <br />Behind the street dealing in my city, there&#039;s obviously plenty of organization. Is there some of that between vendors on SR too?<br /><br />I guess this question sounds a little bit snoopy but what I&#039;m really wondering, with my first orders underway, is whether a vendor with rep might be saying to another vendor I&#039;ve asked for a different product &quot;This guy&#039;s alright, he&#039;ll do what he says he&#039;s going to do&quot; etc <br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering what decent vendors think about scammer vendors. and whether they do much about them because of how they mess up business. Someone helpfully pointed out around here that a vendor that doesn&#039;t use PGP is likely a fly-by-night sloppy operator. It&#039;d be good to know more about what to look out for. There seem to be some serious problems with the rating system, even with the new amendments - pressure to give a thumbs up for access to future deals, subjectivity about the product, the way drugs use can cause buyers to be more &#039;emotional&#039; than might be expected from someone purchasing other products.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read elsewhere that scammers (vendors and buyers) have been taking the market downhill a little over the last year or so. How&#039;s that being tackled? Is this place going to last?
