				It might have been Erowid.&nbsp; But I remember as a young child, reading The Hardy Boys Detective Manual, which had a big section on drugs and narcotics.&nbsp; They listed the various classes of drugs, and their &quot;street names&quot; which were hopelessly out of date.&nbsp; I remember the section of hallucinogens, and there was an alphabet soup of drugs there.&nbsp; LSD, MDA, STP, and I think DMT might have been in there too, I don&#039;t recall.&nbsp; When I grew up and went to college the only hallucinogens were LSD, Peyote, and Psilocibin. <br /><br />Then MDMA came along, and I read that it was related to MDA, which brought back my memory of all those other unknown three letter psychedelics.&nbsp; <br /><br />So it was either Erowid, which is the most likely, or if DMT was known in the 1960&#039;s/70&#039;s, it might have been through the Hardy Boys.

				Yea I think it was DMT the spirit molecule. Followed by an intensive research on erowid experiences. Then later I think I saw the movie enter the void. But honestly IDK, when did DMT 1st hear about me? before time? maybe birth?
