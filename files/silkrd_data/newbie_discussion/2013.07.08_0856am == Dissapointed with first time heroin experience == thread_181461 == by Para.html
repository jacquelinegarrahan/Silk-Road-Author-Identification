				So, I have been doing bumps (snorted) of #4 heroin for the last three hours.&nbsp; The product is from a reputable vendor who claims it to be of extremely high quality.&nbsp; The reviews from other buyers are all glowing.&nbsp; Yet, I am not getting any of the good effects others talk about.&nbsp; I feel a little bit warmer, slightly dizzy and earlier on i was feeling energized and in a good mood (i was in a great mood before dosing).&nbsp; Now I am not even feeling that happy, maybe even a bit pissed off.&nbsp; I&#039;m only getting a little bit of itching in my legs, but that&#039;s about it. <br /><br />I&#039;m being really careful and recording my dosing.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my notes:<br /><br />3.17 pm&nbsp; half match head railed<br />3.32pm&nbsp; Slightly bigger dose railed<br />3.50pm,&nbsp; about same as first dose railed<br />4.05 pm&nbsp; small line<br />4.20 pm&nbsp; small line<br />4.35pm&nbsp; bigger line.&nbsp; Feeling ok but nothing amazing<br />5.06&nbsp; &nbsp;small line<br />5.54&nbsp; small line<br /><br /><br />Sooo, what gives? Do some people just not get a buzz off heroin?&nbsp; If it helps, I have tried 20mg Oxy (dissolved in coke for about an hour) before and didn&#039;t really enjoy it that much.&nbsp; I would drift off and then panic because my breathing was slowing down. <br /><br />I may wait a couple of hours and then try smoking some off foil instead.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit peeved because i got half a gram of the stuff!&nbsp; <br />

				Something I remember from my codeine days is that you can&#039;t &#039;stack&#039; your high (with codeine; this might hold true for heroin, or it might not), I mean if you take a small dose, then another small dose, it&#039;s not nearly as effective as taking one proper-sized dose.<br />This might be your problem here. As for the oxycodone, might not have been dissolved long enough? I&#039;ve read it takes minimum 1.5 hours for oxy to dissolve (in water though), other say up to 8 hours. I just snort it (usually 5 mg at a time; I have low tolerance) or parachute.<br /><br />But the first time I did heroin (brown, railed it, small line) I wasn&#039;t all that impressed either, tbh, it felt just like codeine. The third time I had a big fat line, which might&#039;ve been too much. I started nodding hard and felt a bit sick, but also really wonderful. After that all experiences have been great, but these days I stick to occasional oxycodone. (less addiction risk, besides you know what you&#039;re getting with pharms).<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to smoke H on foil unless it&#039;s tar. Snorting it (yes, that&#039;s my solution to everything) will do the job just as well. Or you can smoke it in a roll up cigarette or pipe. Less gets wasted!

				Is this your first experience with heroin? You mentioned doing oxy before, but from what i gather it sounds like this was your first ever experience. If i&#039;m wrong, please excuse me then. You did alot sounds like to not have od&#039;ed if this was your first heroin experience. Sounds like you got some bunk stuff. My advice, don&#039;t push it by doing anymore. #4 heroin is very potent at even a couple of match-head bumps.

				If this is your first outing with Heroin there is something wrong. Do you have an opiate tolerance?<br /><br />What sort of effect are you looking for? Feeling down and itchy is about right. Heroin is a painkiller and depressant. If you panicked taking oxy cos your breath was slowing down maybe you aren&#039;t cut out for opiates.<br /><br />I take opiates to get off my face, sedated, nodding, to lose a day. I can take less and bimble about stoned but I prefer to be anaesthtised.<br /><br /><br />I also have a 20 yr habit... my advice? Take your crappy experience and run! Be grateful you didn&#039;t fall in love first time.<br /><br />If you are determined, get some #3 and smoke it. It&#039;s easier to build up a stone and harder to OD. PLEASE don&#039;t OD.<br /><br />Paki

				Thanks for the replies. <br /><br />s-aint, yes i remember reading that about codeine too.&nbsp; Actually my best experience with opiates was with 5 X 30mg codeine/Paracetamol pills on an empty stomach.&nbsp; Felt like pure bliss.&nbsp; (Only did this once, other times i CWE since i realized Paracetamol is so bad for the liver).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />dolphy7835 &amp; pakchoi23, you are correct, this was my first time with Heroin.&nbsp; I was hoping to get totally blissed out and just have a completely chilled out euphoric time.&nbsp; Yeah, I think i will lay off it for tonight.&nbsp; Maybe I will contact the vendor and ask what they think might be happening.<br /><br /><br />dirtybiscuitzz718, What confuses me is that the vendor has such great feedback.&nbsp; And I have not done any opiates since January.<br /><br />Another thought i had was that maybe opiates just don&#039;t give me the same level of &#039;feel good&#039; effect that others seem to get.&nbsp; I was in S.E. Asia last year and had a few high dose codeine and Hydrocodone experiences (the pure stuff, no APAP).&nbsp; These experiences were not particularly great either (not much euphoria/bliss to speak off).&nbsp; At the time i put it down to dodgy manufacturing of the pills but maybe its just me! <br /><br />Oh well, another drug to cross off the &#039;bucket-list.&#039; Now there just DMT left that i really want to do.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I have had 50mg of Naltrexone (dissolved in water) sitting here the whole time in case i started to get OD symptoms.&nbsp; I figure if things went bad I would drink that and call an ambulance.&nbsp; Yes, I have been a bit apprehensive about doing H!

				Hey how long after the last dose of H is it safe to pop a couple of Benzo&#039;s to get to sleep?&nbsp; I guess there is no hard and fast rule but its been 4 hours since last dose so should be right now yeah?&nbsp; <br /><br />If you guys have not tried it yet I recommend a combo of Benzo&#039;s &amp; melatonin for a great nights sleep (and some crazy vivid dreams to boot).&nbsp; I use Etizolam but probably works just as well or even better with other benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />Tomorrow I should be getting some meth off the nice postie. Might try some H at the tail end of meth, see if that can make some euphoria come of it!<br /><br />

				Put that even out of your mind. Deadly combo; benzos and opiates. Respiratory system can shut down completely while you are sleeping and you&#039;ll never wake up again. Not until after you&#039;ve slept or at least waited several more hours. Seriously, this isn&#039;t one of those don&#039;t do drugs cuz they can kill you speeches. Mixing benzos with opiate&#039;s and\or alcohol is an extreme risk to your health. Be safe please. Pakchoi23 said it best: &quot;take your crappy experience and run&quot;

Reality of the situation is that for some substances (and H is one of them) people just throw 5/5 because they received the product. They are as happy as they can be just because they were not scammed. To this add the fact that the usual junkie doesn&#039;t really care too much for the quality all in all but to have a fix and you do the rest. Sad but true.<br /><br />There was an high feedback vendor that had fenantyl as H and it seems that people there didn&#039;t either understand it (you can find a thread about this just here, hint: &quot;escrow&quot; and &quot;useless&quot;). So don&#039;t trust too much feedback of &quot;normal&quot; users for H quality on the road, there are threads done appositely for this and those are the ones you should use as evidence of the H being good or not before you think it&#039;s a subjective problem.<br /><br />I would bet, actually, that&#039;s much more probably an objective one. If H is not good it&#039;s just a painkiller and sedative and nothing more.

				So I persisted with it after all and managed to enjoy the experience a fair bit more. It&#039;s still not the overwhelming euphoria that i was imagining it to be but still nice.&nbsp; Kinda like being in this apathetic, content and chilled out mind state.&nbsp; I could see why it would be appealing to stay like this if I was stressed out or in pain etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;More itchy now as well.<br /><br />Hmm...&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely becoming more of a downer person now after having been mostly into euphoric stimulants in the past.&nbsp; <br /><br />But i got to say, MXE shits all over this in terms of euphoria, music appreciation, safety profile and cost.&nbsp; So if your an opiate person and haven&#039;t tried it yet, i would highly recommend MXE.<br /><br />I imagine that the rush from IV&#039;ing H would be pretty awesome though......&nbsp; &nbsp;but I wont be going down that path simply because i don&#039;t trust myself being able to hit a vein properly.<br /><br />No way this gear is 95% pure though, I should be dead by now otherwise.&nbsp; Now im wondering whether to raise it with the vendor or just let it go?!&nbsp; <br /><br />

				No it&#039;s like ketamine (but in my opinion, better) so a dissociative.&nbsp; Several people have reported &#039;opiate-like&#039; effects from it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong though, it&#039;s not a opiate replacement and the head-space is more psychedelic and at high doses can get really weird.&nbsp; But i really love the 20-40mg range.&nbsp; Takes about 40 minutes to kick orally in and i usually dim the lights and put on some ambient music or psytrance (Music appreciation is big for me on it).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll see if i can dig up a bluelight thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s the latest thread: <br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/664777-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Methoxetamine-Thread-Hit-12-Oh-look-it-s-MXE-o-clock<br /><br />In my opinion 20mg MXE + 1-2mg Etizolam is pretty damn euphoric and chilled out, but YMMV!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m another who doesn&#039;t really rate heroin. Only time I tried it was when on 45ml methadone. I smoked it on foil (like an amateur), smoked it in a pipe and snorted it over a week or two, and never got anything much off it. It was street H, but legit. Probably was because I already had a tolerance to opiates before trying it.

				&nbsp;You should think about getting some #3. Chasing the Dragon is something you have to get the hang of, but once you&#039;ve got it down, &quot;Smoking&quot; heroin is much easier for the novice smack user to get their dose right. You just have a few lines, wait a few minutes, and if you are not there yet, have a few more lines.&nbsp; As long as you aren&#039;t very drunk and under the influence of downers, you are very unlikely to go over when &quot;Smoking&quot; brown.

				Thanks for the info. I was considering getting a small amount of H to try out (never done it before). I&#039;d do insufflation. <br /><br />Being H, dosage is important to me. So thanks for the info.

				As far as sniffing heroin goes, isn&#039;t the technique to keep it in your nostrils (like snuff tobacco), rather than snort it down (as with coke, speed etc)? Does it differ according to the grade?

				^^That&#039;s a back-handed compliment if ever i saw one!<br /><br />Like i said, the vendor claimed it to be +95% pure and so I wanted to keep a good record since, had it been the case, an OD would be a high risk given my inexperience.&nbsp; Anyway, you got to be doing something else in between racking up lines, drooling and talking to you degenerates :-p<br /><br />I&#039;ll give it another go in a few days time.&nbsp; Probably try smoking it if i can get some caffeine powder to cut it with (read it helps).&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, rack up two match head size doses instead.&nbsp; I dunno, kinda bored by the thought of it now.&nbsp; &nbsp; Got a fucking headache too....
