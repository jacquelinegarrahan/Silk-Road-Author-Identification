				Originally posted here:<br />http://henrymakow.com/2013/05/circumcision-is-trauma-brainwashing.html<br /><br />Circumcision (&quot;torture mutilation&quot;) is designed to destroy the bond between mother and son, and &quot;freeze the mother&#039;s heart.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;The idea that a parallel intention of child mutilation is to freeze up the emotional powers of the mother with feelings of failure and guilt, came to me from my mother, sadly, after she had passed.&nbsp; This theory has been affirmed by every mother with whom I&#039;ve discussed the technology.&nbsp; It&#039;s not accidental that the Illuminati use lies, violence and trauma to freeze up the feminine heart, and stifle its powers with feelings of rejection, failure and guilt.&quot;<br /><br />In his letter, [slave holder] Willie Lynch describes [the use of torture], by which slaveholders could &quot;freeze&quot; the hearts of the otherwise strong and caring mothers of future African slaves.<br /><br />When she becomes a mother, each female experiences a DEEP intuitive desire to nurse and protect her young.&nbsp; This is a deep and structural kind of &quot;bodily knowledge.&quot; It may even run deeper than her desire for survival.&nbsp; This characteristic protective desire of the feminine principle is one of the most powerful forces in nature.&nbsp; The Illuminati and their forces of darkness have been unable to eradicate it, even after 350 million years of evolution.<br /><br />The Willie Lynch&#039;s of the world are ceaselessly searching for new technologies of oppression.&nbsp; They know that if a mother&#039;s evolutionary knowledge and deep sense of duty to protect can be somehow perverted, say by ritualistic brutal and violent humiliation, then this powerful force of nature can be &quot;frozen out&quot; and the process of evolution itself can be diverted for the benefit of the slave holder. <br /><br />If the emotional system of the mother can be traumatized and frozen, she can then easily be infused with deep feelings of guilt and shame, and unnatural helplessness.&nbsp; The powers of a&nbsp; mother can then be easily controlled for purposes of stopping or even reversing evolution.&nbsp; The Willie Lynches of this world need only invite the young slave mother to violate the pre-verbal knowledge that resides deep within her bosom. The feelings of guilt will begin to set in, by which she can then be controlled.&nbsp; In order for this to work, the mother must never be allowed to talk about how SHE felt, about how she felt violated, about how HER HEART became frozen, as she was forced to witness the violent torture mutilation of her husband, father, or infant child (or any infant child for that matter).<br /><br />What I will say next will not be easily understood by many readers, although it would be immediately understood by the likes of a Willie Lynch. The primary goal of infant male genital torture mutilation (politely known as male circumcision) is to attack and freeze the heart of the young mother.&nbsp; Her heart is attacked so as to gain control of her for religious and political mind control purposes. <br /><br />With a frozen heart, she is controlled by the silent feelings of guilt that inevitably creep in.&nbsp; It may seem paradoxical, but SHE, or actually the protective force of nature that beats within her bosom, is the actual target, of the Willie Lynch treatment of her infant child. <br /><br />All of you cut-men out there, ask your mothers before they pass from this window of life, how THEY felt immediately after the torture mutilation of their child.&nbsp; Ask her what were you like before torture mutilation, and what changes did she observe.&nbsp; Would you look her in the eye?&nbsp; Did you refuse her breast?&nbsp; How did she feel about that?<br /><br />It&#039;s also helpful to know when (how old you were) and where the operation was performed.&nbsp; Also ask her what the doctor said and did just before he took you from your mother&#039;s arms, and if he prevented her from being a witness.&nbsp; (The operation is bloody, painful and noisy, and once heard, the screams of a helpless infant child being tortured would given any mother nightmares ... they are never to be forgotten.)<br /><br />Listen carefully and warmly, with total love and forgiveness in your heart.&nbsp; You will be witness as the memories of pain that have been frozen in her heart for all these years slowly begin to thaw out, right in front of you.&nbsp; That silence of your mother, was a suffering of your mother&#039;s heart.&nbsp; The pain that you have long forgotten was nothing compared to the pain that had been hiding, &quot;frozen&quot; within her young mother&#039;s heart, all these years.)<br /><br />CHILD LOSES TRUST<br /><br />It&#039;s a medical fact that after completion of this cruel and violent, and very bloody and painful &quot;ritual,&quot; the helpless and innocent infant child is returned to its mother in a neuro-chemically frozen, or &quot;catatonic,&quot; state.&nbsp; For months, the levels of cortisol (the hormone of death) will be at 1.5 times over pre-torture baseline in the limbic brain stem, and in left trunk of the sympathetic nerve system, which covers the digestive system and the heart.&nbsp; After studies of MK-Ultra, it is now fully documented that the traumatized infant child will refuse to trust its parents.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Bible calls this distrust, &quot;circumcision of the infant&#039;s heart.&quot;&nbsp; The distrust is deep and pre-verbal, i.e. at &quot;pre-formative&quot; levels.&nbsp; It is not an accidental side effect of the intentional trauma.&nbsp; The child will also refuse to look its mother in the eye, potentially forever.&nbsp; Before its torture mutilation, it loved to trust its mother, and gaze into her beautiful symmetrical face, forming images at the deepest formative levels, all the while beaming pure innocence and joy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Willie Lynch treatment puts an end to that.&nbsp; The traumatized child will also refuse to attach to and nurse its mother, often for periods up to 6 to 18 months.&nbsp; The modern versions of Willie Lynch, aka our medical doctors, know that this refusal of the traumatized child to nurse will infuse a deep sense of guilt in the heart of the mother.&nbsp; For many mothers, the rejection shuts down her breast feeding system totally, and she is forced to put baby on the bottle.&nbsp; The Willie Lynches of the medical profession know without breast milk created by suckling the breast of its mother, the development of the child&#039;s immune system becomes stunted, all to the benefit of the Illuminati war machine and the medical industry.<br /><br />Life being what it is, the child eventually digests the trauma, and the cortisols re-establish at a new baseline.&nbsp; However the wounds of guilt and shame in the mother&#039;s heart are silent.&nbsp; They can never fully heal, until she learns to break free and fully honor the maternal instincts that reside within her bosom.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, in our modern slave society, medicated by the Illuminati, she will never be allowed to talk freely about how SHE too was traumatized.&nbsp; This emotional &quot;freezing out&quot; of the mother&#039;s heart is the real and actual target of the modern Willie-Lynch treatment that mothers and infant children receive in the maternity wards of modern American (Pentagon-controlled) hospitals.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, doctors of Illuminati medicine will bark and quack in unison ... &quot;there are &#039;other purposes&#039; for torture mutilation of an infant child.&quot;&nbsp; However, none of them make any damn sense, and ALL of them are PURE EVIL. <br /><br />In the language of Willie Lynch, the goal of the trauma to the female, is to &quot;freeze out&quot; the feminine principle, to block up her emotional&nbsp; powers with feelings of guilt, and prevent her from finding fulfillment by expression the upward evolutionary desire that beats in her heart.<br />

				Circumcision is caused by feminists. The peak of circ in the US was also the peak of feminist sentiment. All circumcisions must be approved by the mother – the father has no authority in the hospital. In a study, in 84% of couples surveyed, it was the mother who decided in favor of mutilating their boy.<br /><br />How can you women live with yourselves? You are so evil, that you happily approve genital mutilation on your male children. How can you women look at yourselves in the mirror everyday?

				Actually, the the first big rise in circumcision came in the US in the 1800s because it was thought to reduce pleasurable sensation in the penis, which in turn was thought to reduce masturbation.. which it doesnt. along with graham crackers and salt peter&nbsp; it was said to stop you whacking off, by MALE doctors of the time.<br /><br />

				When circumcision was introduced, it was believed that masturbation caused a lot of different illnesses. It was considered extremely immoral and many children, both male and female, have been circumcised through the years because parents found them “in the act.”<br /><br />It was already known at the end of the 1800s that the removal of the foreskin, which is the only moveable part of the penis would reduce sexual sensitivity and restrict movement of the penile shaft.<br /><br />It was believed that masturbation caused blindness, mental illness, alcoholism, epilepsy and several other ills. It therefore made sense to some physicians that circumcision would stop masturbation and prevent the onset of these illnesses.<br /><br />Non-religious circumcision in English-speaking countries arose in a climate of negative attitudes towards sex, especially concerning masturbation. In her 1978 article The Ritual of Circumcision, Karen Erickson Paige writes: “In the United States, the current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice. The original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin, or prepuce, was to control ‘masturbatory insanity’ – the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the ‘polluting’ practice of ‘self-abuse.’”<br /><br />http://docakilah.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/male-circumcision-originally-created-to-prevent-masturbation/

Yes, feminism is a HATE movement against men. For example, since male genital mutilation, aka circumcision, is legal, why aren&#039;t feminists DEMANDING that female genital mutilation should ALSO be legal?<br /><br />Answer is pretty simple. Because American/western women have been brainwashed by misandry, aka feminism, and have deep subconscious hatred towards men.<br /><br />Just look at Sharon Osbourne, laughing on national TV about a man who got his penis cut off by his wife.<br /><br />Since women DEMANDED to be treated as equals to men, I guess that means that whenever we hear about a woman getting her genital mutilated, the proper response for us men is to LAUGH at her. Right?<br /><br />As for myself? I am going to start DEMANDING that female genital mutilation becomes legal, up and until the practice of male genital mutilation is completely abolished.

				Circumcisizing a boy created a lifelong unconscious trauma memory. As it was pointed out, young boys who are circumcisized generally refuse their mother&#039;s breast. The babies KNOW on a subconscious level that she had betrayed them, and they will never trust their mothers.<br /><br />And then women complain that men are becoming &quot;more misogynistic&quot;. Uh, maybe if you bitches would stop mutilating the baby&#039;s penis, they would stop developing subconscious hatred towards you?

				I posted this article about circumcision on a different forum, and one girl replied &quot;I think it looks better than a non-circ penis&quot;.<br /><br />Oh? So we men are supposed to MUTILATE OUR GENITALS because you women think it &quot;looks better&quot;?<br /><br />Do you women even realize how fucking arrogant and entitled you are?<br /><br />What if a man said &quot;I think you should cut off your clit because it makes your vagina look better&quot;?<br /><br />THEN you ladies would have a shit storm.<br /><br />I say that female genital mutilation MUST BE LEGALIZED until male genital mutilation is banned. That would be REAL EQUALITY, and equality is what you women demanded, right?

				Are you women really this stupid? Do you really think that your own hatred is not going to be projected right back at you?<br /><br />The reason why younger men are becoming more violent and more angry is because of how badly women treat them.<br /><br />You&#039;ve perhaps noticed the huge increase in younger men being violent towards women.Why do you think that is happening? Is it perhaps the younger men&#039;s subconscious reaction to you women&#039;s feminist man-hatred against them?<br /><br />Within 5 to ten years, it will get so bad for women that men beating up women will become the NORM, and there will be nothing that you women can do to stop it.<br /><br />Feminism has created a hyper-violent society, where men have been abused from birth by women and so men have zero respect for women and treat women like the trash that they are.<br /><br />The future is VERY dark for you women.<br /><br />Think A Clockwork Orange meets Mad Max multiplied by ten. THAT is the kind of society we are looking at in the future. Where women can be raped or beaten and there is nothing that can be done to stop it.

				I got circumcised when I was 24. I was a quite a pain full experience. Yet it was one of the best days of my life.<br />And I cannot imagine going back.&nbsp; And would gladly do it again. No more urine getting stuck between the fore skin.<br />Easy cleaning. No more shaking of the excess. I quess it also improve sex. And less change about half of getting HIV.<br />So my advice get yours circumcised if you are male of course.

				Male circumcision would have to be removal of the glans for male and female circumcision to be equal, so remember to fight for that too.<br /><br />If your point is &quot;male circumcision shouldn&#039;t be done to children for non-medical reasons&quot; then I agree with you.

				For my it was not medical reasons. It was religious.<br />With female circumcision in some case they remove everything that includes the clitoris. So the woman in question <br />can never enjoy intercourse. And there is no base for this in wisdom or in Islamic law. In fact it goes against it because men and women have intercourse for enjoyment.<br /><br />If wish you all the best

Both of these sick cults have been used to justify the murder of millions of people.<br /><br />Circumcision is another good example of how barbaric these three religions are.<br /><br />As for why circumcision is bad. Men who have been circumcised later in life, and have experienced what sex is like BEFORE and AFTER circum, all say that they lost like 90 percent of the feelings in their penis.<br /><br />Science also states that the foreskin has more nerve endings than anywhere else in the body.<br /><br />So, keep mutilating your penis because you think some God in the sky will be happy with you for doing so. And while you&#039;re at it, how about you do the world a favor and cut your own head off, too? I&#039;m sure God would be pleased with you for that, as would the rest of us.

				Did you every read the Quran yours self? I guess not. If you got most of your information for the google. <br />Then there enough haters that pull every thing out of context. If you would have read the book you would know<br />that how many times it say. Do the not think. Islam is a religion of reason not blind faith. <br /><br />Actually the Quran is all about reason. And I read the Quran every day. I speak and understand Classic Arabic plus the teaching of the Prophet Muhammed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me give you an example then you can say if that sound barbaric to you. <br /><br />None of you truly believe till he love for his brother what he loves for him self. <br /><br />From the Surah 93 verse <br />&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression,<br />10.&nbsp; And repulse not the beggar<br /><br />Does this sound barbaric to you?<br /><br />Surah number 2<br /><br />256. There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.<br /><br />Clearly says here there is no compulsion in religion. Is that barbaric. People are not forced to become muslim get there foreskin removed. It all based on free will. <br /><br />And ago million is an great exaggeration. <br />And about you calling me and idiot there is no need for insults can we not debate like civilized people.<br />There is a verse saying. Invite them with wisdom and the best of manner. For some one yelling high and low about being civilized you show little of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I sense a great deal of anger and discontent in your words. And I dont understand why. I wonder where does this stem from. Are you happy. I mean have you every thought about it I am happy and if yes then what does that mean. Do you fear poverty do you fear death?<br /><br />I wish you the best. May Allah guide you to true happiness.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				if i had sons i would not have the procedure done. i don&#039;t think its right for religious or cosmetic reasons. its not fair for me to permanently remove a part of my childs body for my own selfish reasons. when he became old enough to make the decision on his own and he felt it was something he wanted to do i would support him but i would hope he would like his body the way it is naturally.
