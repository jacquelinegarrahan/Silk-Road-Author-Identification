				So, I&#039;m thinking of starting my own business of reshipping SilkRoad products for vendors outside of the UK so people can get domestic in my country for goods usually needing delivery, meaning quicker service. However, I am reselling IRL too, specifically MDMA pills offered by a SR vendor. However, a friend gave me an idea to help beat the local market hands down, which was to flavour the pills.<br /><br />I was thinking, would a long soak in concentrated food flavouring work, or does anyone have any ideas/methods on this? It&#039;d be something new for sure.

				I have tried almost everything to mask the rank taste of MDMA: dissolved in juice, fruit, alcohol, that shit is just nasty. No one I know ever munches their pills either, gross.<br /><br />Unless it was a sweet enteric coating like advil tablets, which would probably affect absorption in the stomach, I don&#039;t really see the point...<br />just my opinion tho...

				Beating back the flavor on MDMA is next to impossible.&nbsp; Some people enclose them sugar and thats the closest I&#039;ve been to enjoying MDMA as a flavor.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115868.msg782346#msg782346">Quote from: exis on January 31, 2013, 11:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have tried almost everything to mask the rank taste of MDMA: dissolved in juice, fruit, alcohol, that shit is just nasty.

				Why flavour? It is not that people are going to suck on those tablets.
