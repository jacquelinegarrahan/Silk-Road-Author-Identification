				Greeting birds-of-a-feather,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been active on SR for 6 (ish) months, but I have never posted or commented or written here in the forums.&nbsp; Admittedly, because I was ignorant to the...significance you all place in participation here, but also because being as invisible as possible was (and still is) a priority of mine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always tried to conduct myself similarly in real life during the past 15 or so years I&#039;ve been a recreational user.<br />However, as a moderately experienced SR&#039;er, I find myself increasingly interested in being a part of the conversation.&nbsp; So here I am.<br />Any helpful advice or tricks-of-the-trade would be appreciated.&nbsp; New (online) friendships also welcomed.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;???<br />GoodTimeCharlie

				I must say after spending the last days reading the forum, I find it surprisingly interesting myself. Lots of deep insights, meaningful conversations and important tips.<br />I doubt many regular forums on the clearnet are as interesting as this one

				Hello<br />I did the same thing and used SR for a long time before i joined the forums. <br />now i probably spend too much time on the forums lol <br />but i have learned a ton of information and its constantly changing so its good to be informed. <br />especially when it comes to security, theres so many people here who are far more capable they i. they are invaluable and i would probably be lost otherwise.<br /><br />you need 50 posts before you can post in other forum sections. after 100 posts you can give karma. <br />welcome to the neighborhood!

				Just wanted to add that when you get to 100 posts you also no longer have to type those damn Captcha letters anymore! That was a big inspiration for me to get to 100! (cheating with spam mind you, in the proper forum&nbsp; of course!!)<br /><br />But yeah you learn alot here one of the Biggest Pluses for me is searching out the new vendors I am going to deal with, and reading about all the latest scammers to help avoid them<br />and also about other scams going on like all the Phishing that is going on. If you dont know what that is LOOK INTO IT. I strongly advise this<br /><br />Look after your money because others are also trying to look after it&nbsp; 8)<br />Audious Amigos

				Greetings GoodTimeCharlie<br /><br />exactly the same story for my part - found SR about a year ago and found my way in and have been very active since.<br />A few weeks ago I got really interested in this forum and your point about the stealth by not using SR and the forum - I use different <br />usernames&nbsp; ;D and since I have no plan to become a vendor that works great.<br /><br />I do believe we can learn a lot here and also help with our own exp.<br /><br />We have to keep the Libertarianism going and growing1

				The forums have been an invaluable source of information for me, both with what vendors to use and with security issues. I am 100% confident in my anonymity at this point, thanks to advice solely from these forums. And the reviews and commentary on all the vendors has been extremely helpful as well, and has led me to several great purchases that I had total confidence in and was completely satisfied by.
