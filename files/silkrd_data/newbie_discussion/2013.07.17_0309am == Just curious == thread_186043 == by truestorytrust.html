				After reading through the threads some more and what not, I was wondering if some Vendors send out the package and just don&#039;t hit in transit right away as I&#039;m hoping this is my case, just a thought.

				I think it&#039;s much more likely that the opposite would be true - that the vendor would mark the package &quot;in transit&quot; EARLIER than it actually is. I doubt what you&#039;re describing happens very often because then the vendor runs the risk of spending the time, money, and product on the shipment, while the buyer still has the option to &quot;cancel&quot; and get all their BTC back. Which not only is lost money on the vendor&#039;s part, but also presents a danger as the buyer could have had his house raided and therefore cancels any current orders because he knows LE will be monitoring his postal address, and potentially coming closer to catching vendors by at least getting their general area from the return addresses.<br /><br />But how long has it been that your order&#039;s been processing? Have you messaged the vendor yet? If it&#039;s only been a day, maybe give it a bit longer, but if it has been longer, message them and they may have an understandable reason! And if you don&#039;t appreciate that reason, that cancel button is always there as well, but try to contact them first. :)

				I&#039;ve had quite a few transactions in the past few months, and all the vendors I&#039;ve chosen, the time between when they marked it in transit, and the time it arrived, the math worked out that they probably shipped when they said they did. Only one vendor, who is a TV show chemistry teacher wannabe, has not come through. He waited a week to mark it in transit, then I never saw the product, or received a response to my very polite messages. When the time came for it to go to resolution, he pulled all his products, never responded to any messages from me or SR, and I received a 100% refund. It was also the one time I went against my better judgement, after researching his history, and ordered anyway. I wanted to try the best. Total waste of time and energy.

				I click to confirm shipment immediately before I leave home, package in hand and ready to slip into the collection box.<br />Because I know I&#039;ll be away for the subsequent several hours, I want the &quot;in transit&quot; to reflect as accurately as possible.
