				Hey guys, I&#039;m looking for the best #4 you have ever had, I really want to try a strong batch and I heard it is amazing when mixed with BTH. Looking for serious feed back on quality, cost, and shipping speed. Thanks guys!

				Hey, I&#039;m not sure what country you reside but if its America, most of the white is on the east coast. The quality varies and so do the weight of the bags. The stamp bags usually dont produce more then a point of gear. I&#039;m not sure why people use SR for opiates. They are very expensive, esp the heroin, the pills are sorta normal. If I were to go 9 miles up the road right now I could snatch a b for less then half a yard which is 13 bags. You prob wont even get that for 100 on here.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, SR could be the place for &#039;quality stuff&#039; , I wouldnt konw though :p cuz im off that wagon and on others :p<br /><br />GL

				For #4 H I&#039;ve noticed the prices are high, but for BTH the quality is tons higher and the price is pretty similar and in some cases cheaper than street. As for pills, atleast where I live they are almost 5times the price on SR as they are on the street. I can pick up a 4mg Dilly for $3 and an 8mg from $5-10. It&#039;s such a good price on the street and I have the connections I have to admit I&#039;ve seriously considered becoming a vendor, but to be honest while the extra cash would be nice (and it&#039;d def cover my H habbit) I&#039;m scared to death of being charged with trafficing. I mean if I got caught buying some H off of SR I&#039;d get a slap on the wrist compared to if I started selling.<br /><br />Also, for me personally I have to IV 4x the amount of pills morph equiv to get the same high as I do for H so it&#039;s a lot cheaper to just buy H for me. But I only started going to SR after my H dealer got pinched and I had absolutely no idea who to go to after that and since I burn through my stuff pretty rapidly I&#039;d be looking at a serious withdrawal seeing that I&#039;ve been on opiates for almost 10 years now. (Only started H about year ago though).

				Ya man the pills on the street are variable by who you know. Usually the closer to the script buster you are the cheaper
