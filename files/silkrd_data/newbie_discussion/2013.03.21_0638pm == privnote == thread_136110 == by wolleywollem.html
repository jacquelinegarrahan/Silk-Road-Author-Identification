				Don&#039;t really know for sure the point you are getting at, but to add to my quest for 50 posts I will add that a lot of&nbsp; vendors don&#039;t use privnote. I believe it is because to view you need java script enabled which is turned off by default in Tor for security reasons. There are a few threads around about privnote and security.

				From what I read researching on the forums I won&#039;t use it. Plus GPG/PGP is easy to use.

				It&#039;s been a couple months since I read about it but it had possible security issues that could compromise your information. I think it was Astor who explained it in the thread.

				i would love if u could show me that link :) <br /><br />i find it even better than pgp because when somebody else than the vendor reads it, then the vendor cant read it anymore. so u can be sure someone else read it. and then u know for sure when something is wrong. which u cant know with pgp i think?

				Karmapharm uses it now exclusively because he keeps have problems with PGP, which i guess according to y&#039;all is not as safe which sucks cause he has really good reviews and prices for molly, should i spend the extra ten bucks on another vendor to use PGP?
