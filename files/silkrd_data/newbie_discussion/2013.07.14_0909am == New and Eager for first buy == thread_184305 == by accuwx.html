				I&#039;ve been reading a lot and think I understand how this works but the only thing that is escaping me is a legit place to get bitcoins and then have them added to my account on silkroad marketplace to make an order. I did look around the forum but I may have overlooked it so if I did I apologize but can someone please tell me how to do this in a step by step manner? I&#039;m just looking to make a small purchase to try the whole system out and see how it goes. Thanks in advance!

				It seems that the larger anonymous btc traders are all closed, either permanently or temporarily. An alternative is localbitcoins.com, a p2p site where individuals can advertise to buy or sell bitcoin. You can meet in person if a seller happens to live around you, or exchange funds in some other way. Many sellers will accept cash deposit into a local branch of a national bank. So you stick money in the seller&#039;s account, and then the agreed upon number of coins are released to your localbitcoins wallet. You can then send them to SR or anywhere else. Escrow through the site protects both buyers and sellers. You will need to create an account in order to use the site, but you can fill in any information you want, real or fake, and no sort of id verification is required.<br /><br />Once you place an order, the seller may wish to communicate with you via text message, so have a disposable phone standing by if that&#039;s an issue for you. Also, expect to pay 5-10 dollars per coin more than you would at a mainstream exchange. Also, many sellers are small-timers who only have two or three coins for sale at any one time. Also, once you place an order you may have only 60 or 90 minutes to get to the bank before the order cancels automatically, so be ready to roll before ordering. Overall, localbitcoins seems to work well, though I still have hope for Blue Sky to get back on its feet.

				i have a few sources for bitcoins as sometimes one or the other isnt available<br /><br />localbitcoins is great as the previous poster mentioned. you can meet someone in person, or do online transfers with a variety of options (bank transfer, Dwolla, Okpay, Vanillareload cards, moneypaks, paypal,etc)<br /><br />there are a few vendors on the road that will convert cash,moneypaks and vanilla reloads for a fee. i use jumbomonkeybiscuit<br /><br />virwox isnt bad after you get past the (2) mandatory 48hour transfers. also has a variety of loading options <br /><br />i have tried to do transfers with coinbase, but you must verify your account and get it whitelisted. they might have convenient fees, but it takes 4 days<br /><br />if you are looking in a hurry, try localbitcoins or jmb

				I tell ya the best way is with this vendor cityofangelsxoxo They are fast and cheap. I have bought them different ways but to me this person is the fastest and very easy way to get your coins. If you are just geting a few they are by far the cheapest way.&nbsp; good luck
