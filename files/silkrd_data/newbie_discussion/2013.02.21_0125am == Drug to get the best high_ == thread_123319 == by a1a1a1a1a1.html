				Hi guys, I&#039;m new to this &quot;drug&#039; scene and I&#039;m not the type of person you would expect taking drugs anyways. There is a high possibility that I will be experimenting with some the coming weekend and I wanted to ask for SR&#039;s advice.<br /><br />I can only list the &quot;noob&quot; drugs for now, but please add to this list, there is much I have to learn from you.<br /><br />Weed, E, LSD<br /><br />(Is weed a drug?)

				psychedelic&nbsp; tryptamines and phenylathelamines&nbsp; &nbsp; such and mushrooms, mescaline, dmt&nbsp; &nbsp; are basically the least harmful drugs possible. <br /><br /><br />tbh&nbsp; lsd, mushrooms, mescaline, dmt&nbsp; &nbsp; find out which one you like,&nbsp; you&#039;ll never get ill health effects or brain damage or addicted<br />marijuana is pretty safe,&nbsp; so is unadulterated mdma.&nbsp; none of the drugs&nbsp; &nbsp; are known to be that problematic or addicting<br /><br />obv i wouldn&#039;t really advice drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, or cocaine&nbsp; &nbsp;but those are all &quot;good highs&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; but chances are will ruin your life. addiction etc<br /><br /><br />what are you hoping to accomplish by drug use?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				Nothing beats the psychedelic experience! As suggested above, try the tryptamines and phenylethylamines. <br /><br />Particular shout outs to DMT, LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, and of course the mushrooms :)<br /><br /><br />cabfare asks a good question: what are you hoping to accomplish?

				Mushrooms are great for the beginning psychonaut, shorter trips and great insight. LSD can be harsh if your mind is new to psychedelics, but it still would be a good starter.<br /><br />2C-B is an interesting and easy drug to explore, but it has a short trip duration. Salvia is interesting. DMT is powerful.

				MDMA. <br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s called ecstasy.<br /><br />Literally, the best high.<br />Just respect it and don&#039;t roll every fucking month.

				+1 to Scooby. Can&#039;t beat MDMA. Just don&#039;t go crazy doing it every weekend, you&#039;ll lose the magic for a start and you&#039;ll be a fried unit very quickly.... stay safe :)
