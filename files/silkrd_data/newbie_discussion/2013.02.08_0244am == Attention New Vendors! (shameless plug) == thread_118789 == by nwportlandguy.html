				Hi there :)&nbsp; Are you a new vendor to the road?&nbsp; Would you like honest, quality reviews posted in the forums?&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only will I post that review in exchange for a free sample, but I will create the review thread for you if you have not reached those pesky 50 posts yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all know it can just waste a new vendor&#039;s precious time making 50 bullshit posts just to start a review thread.&nbsp; Get those posts at your leisure as I will start the review thread for you.&nbsp; I am happy to do this for all honest and pleasant vendors.&nbsp; I will only ask for a very modest compensation in product or a few bucks.<br /><br />I promise you that your time saved will be well worth the trouble of reaching out to me!! ;D<br /><br />Welcome and good luck to you all!

				I don&#039;t mind reaching 50 posts since I also want to contribute to the community besides being a vendor. Where do you live? We&#039;re in the process of testing shipment to EU and other country&#039;s, and we need reviewers on both&nbsp; our vendor page and on the forum. So we might charge a tiny amount of BTC for the review copies so people are able to review on the vendor page as well. In return you recieve a top quality product for a low price. If you&#039;re interested just send me a message.

				@ King Verence... LOL,&nbsp; I gotta get my name out there somehow ;D<br /><br />@Best Dutch Drugs....&nbsp; Thanks for inquiring.&nbsp; I wrote you a msg and will take a look at your vendor page.<br /><br /><br />To anybody else that is interested;&nbsp; I live in the USA and I am on Ballzinator&#039;s list of reliable reviewers.&nbsp; You will always get the honest review from me that is promised!

				cynicism aside, I must say your offer is well worth it for new vendors. you pay with a review instead of btc, so it&#039;s not like saying &quot;send me free drugs&quot; at all.

				@ King Verrence, Thank you for understanding where I&#039;m coming from!&nbsp; That&#039;s why I don&#039;t feel embarrassed to have this ad up.&nbsp; I&#039;m very up front about what I&#039;m offering and I will always come through with my end of the bargain and leave a fair and honest review. <br /><br />&nbsp;I like to emphasize that it&#039;s an honest review&nbsp; so nobody thinks I&#039;m trying to sell good reviews.&nbsp; If a vendor&#039;s product is shitty, I&#039;m definitely going to call them out publicly, as much as I don&#039;t like to do that.<br /><br /><br />Honest new vendors are still welcome to contact me!&nbsp;

				Yeah for sure, you are a very honest buyer indeed, a pleasure to deal with. <br />I would happily take what you say as the truth, after dealing with you over the last few transactions.<br /><br />Sainsburys
