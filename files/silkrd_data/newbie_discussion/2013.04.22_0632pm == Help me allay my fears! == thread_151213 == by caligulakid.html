				Hello all,<br /><br />Complete UK newbie.&nbsp; Put my first ever order in for some bud from a very reputable looking seller.&nbsp; Said on their page that they&#039;ll be away from 19th - 23rd.&nbsp; Placed my order on the 17th, with order saying dispatched on the 18th.&nbsp; Now the 22nd and not received anything.&nbsp; Their page said today that they&#039;re back and can process orders and messages from tomorrow.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been getting ratings over the last few days on the item I ordered saying all is good and arrived.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know whether I should contact the seller, or wait for the 25th, assuming it wasn&#039;t dispatched on the 18th and give them time to process it from the date they&#039;re operating again?&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t want to annoy anyone with a message if it&#039;s on the way, but I also really want some for the weekend! <br /><br />Being a newbie, I&#039;m paranoid enough that it hasn&#039;t arrived and using the service for the time...&nbsp; I obviously haven&#039;t got a resolve option (sure it won&#039;t come to that), but is there a likelihood that its been intercepted?<br /><br />Please allay my fears and tell me it&#039;ll be alright - I really want SR to work for me, because I can only find a guy locally that constantly rips off his customers with crap stuff and underweight.&nbsp; Have tried for months to find someone else, but to no avail.<br /><br />What are your thoughts, folks?<br /><br />Cheers!!<br />

				Was it JOR?<br /><br />I find his packages come in time, some next day, some in 4 days, even if ordered on the same day.<br /><br />No harm in dropping him a line 2moro once the postie has arrived if your stuff isn&#039;t there.<br /><br />

				My first order didn&#039;t arrive for over 10 days (was international though). I was convinced that it was not going to arrive and had already considered that money &quot;lost&quot;, and then one morning I got up and there was the package sitting by my door. You can&#039;t believe how happy I was on that day. If it hadn&#039;t arrived I might have never have come back to SR.<br /><br />Four days is nothing and not cause for concern (especially if they fall over a weekend). I&#039;d give it a few more days and then contact the seller if you are still worried.<br /><br />The other thing to consider is some sellers mark it as &quot;in transit&quot; either as soon as they have printed your name out and stuck it on the package (but not necessarily posted it), or some just mark it as &quot;in transit&quot; early so that you can finalize early if you want to. The fact it said &quot;in transit&quot; on the 18th does not mean it actually went that day. It might also have missed the post for that day and been collected the following morning depending on how your country&#039;s postal system works.

				I&#039;d say give it at least a week before contacting sellers. The first transaction is always nerve-wrecking, but once that package comes in, it&#039;s a smooth and steady river flow from then on.&nbsp; ;)

				Just remember, we&#039;re all human beings (hopefully :o ) on this site, and so are everyone who works to get your package to you, that being said, some things may take longer, I usually give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and NEVER FE... Just give them some extra time, especially for international transactions. Best of luck on the road. :)
