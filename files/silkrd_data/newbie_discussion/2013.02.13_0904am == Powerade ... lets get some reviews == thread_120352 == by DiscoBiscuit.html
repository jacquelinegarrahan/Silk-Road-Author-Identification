				Anyone have experience with him? He&#039;s obviously been here awhile and seems respected, but I really couldnt find much on his actual product (i&#039;m referring to MDMA here). <br />soo.. anybody have some input?<br /><br />I&#039;m especially interested in hearing from people from the US who have ordered from him

				Well thats sad to hear... I can&#039;t say I like his terms too much (requires FE, and no refund for items not delivered internationally). It seems like most of his orders come through (from what I can tell.. but that&#039;s why I started this thread haha). <br /><br />I haven&#039;t even made my first order yet and I&#039;m constantly going back and forth on who I should order from. Its killin me.<br /><br />OA takes way too damn long and I hate the idea of a shipment from NL<br />SuperTrips was going off the deep end last i checked<br />Foxebelle was who I really wanted to order with; glad I never got to that point <br />XTCEXPRESS has been gettin some shady reviews lately<br />Ivory is just too high $$ for me<br /><br />just to name a couple... frustrating, to say the least<br /><br /><br />I wish to hell someone from the US would start producing and mass vending some high quality MDMA at LEGIT prices.

				Ordered some speed from him 2 times, both came good packaged and stealthy - product wise it was very wet and lost a lot of weight drying, decent grade.

				Posted this already in the &quot;official&quot; Powerade Thread, but nevertheless.<br />My experiences with powerade so far have been nothing but good so far, and seeing him back I had to order 2g Speed on friday evening, among other orders&nbsp; with other well known german vendors. So far he´s been the only one to mark the shipment in transt (doesn´t mean the world, I know, but still..) I was a little concerned about some critical feedbacks concerning his stealth so I send him (or his companion) a message adressing that topic. The answer came in a few minutes, saying they send &quot;pretty stealth&quot; (domestic). So his communication seems to work nowadays.<br />I don´t know how to judge his personal situation that he explained in a few postings, but I can totally understand that he´s been down for a while. Have been in the same situation 3 years ago (divorcve, 2 children). It´s a real Fuck-Up!. the previous orders I had with Powerade (all H, quitting now, 4-6 Weeks ago. were totally&nbsp; fast and smooth. The H-Quality was way above street quality, weight on top and really fast delivery (sucks to wait for it). By the way his new Heroin listings look exactly the same, maybe same batch or same pictures. In every case I can recommend it for that price! (If it´s the old stuff)<br />So I simply trust Powerade because there was no shit with me, of course I have also read the negative feedbacks and reviews here in the forums and I feel sorry for those people and all the stress they had with their orders.I know that mindfuck. But I honestly only had good experiences with Powerade, and my reviews are not for sale!<br />These are just my personal opinions, but for domestic orders i´m pretty confident with powerade. Also his new policies described on the vendors page seem very buyer friendly.<br /><br />I hope he´s back in old shape and I will definetly post my experiences with the current speed order I am (hopefully) going to receive in a few days as soon as I can. Keeping you informed.<br />Have a nice Weekend
