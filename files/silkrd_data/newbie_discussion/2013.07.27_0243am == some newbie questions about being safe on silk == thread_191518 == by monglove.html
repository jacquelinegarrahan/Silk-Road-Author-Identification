				So I&#039;m a fairly new user, just asking for info to allay certain fears I have about using sr.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the mo, my security is okay but not great. I use BTguard and Hidemyass (recently heard they&#039;re shite so I&#039;ll booting them for a better, bitcoin accepting VPN, I tumble my BTC through Bitcoin fog and I&#039;ll soon be trading cash in person for my coins, to avoid too many payments in my bank account to localbitcoins.&nbsp; I use PGP for my address, except once when I rather stupidly used privnote (won&#039;t risk doing that again), and sorting out Tails in my next project.&nbsp; Also I&#039;m domestic so interception isn&#039;t really an issue.&nbsp; Considering I do all that from now on, my chances of getting caught should hopefully be slim. <br /><br />However, assuming the worst does happen (like the cops raid a vendor, check his correspondence and see my name and address) are they a) likely to come after me, and b) can they make anything stick?&nbsp; Assuming my residence and computer is clean as whistle, of course, which considering my paranoia IT WILL BE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many thanks!&nbsp;

				honestly i&#039;d say you&#039;ve got one decent set up right there especially if you are just planning on buying for personal use.&nbsp; If you look around the forums very very very rarely do you ever see a post that says &quot;BUYER&#039;S BUSTED!!&quot;&nbsp; The reason for that is LEO only busts buyers IRL because usually that person knows something about the person above them, They can bully the buyer into rolling over and giving up information.&nbsp; The silk road is an anonymous system and marketplace.&nbsp; We don&#039;t know jack shit about our vendors.&nbsp; All the information we could give them about the vendors here they could find themselves just as easily by merely opening up an account on the forums.&nbsp; but with that said that&#039;s no excuse to get lazy so good for you for being thorough.&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore if you&#039;re just buying to get high you&#039;ll be just fine.&nbsp; Hell even if you plan to resell i think you&#039;ve got a pretty decent setup there but don&#039;t quote me on that there are others here to better answer that question.&nbsp; But don&#039;t fret too much friend enjoy the road and your new found heaven :)

				Cheers for the info!&nbsp; I figured I&#039;d be pretty safe, but I was musing on buying some medium amounts cos of value for money, not massive, but maybe enough for the cops to think I was trying to deal, which I&#039;m not. That&#039;s what kinda started the paranoia.&nbsp; Anyway, the main fear I had was if a vendor was somehow arrested and had my details on his computer, having decrypted them.&nbsp; That said, I assume all decent vendors don&#039;t store that kind of info anyway (as it&#039;s incriminating as fuck), and I&#039;m guessing the cops have better things do than go after someone for a few g&#039;s of whatever.&nbsp; Especially when the vendors ave flogging kilos.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				you can definitely never be too safe.&nbsp; But from what you&#039;re tellling me i don&#039;t think you have much to worry about.&nbsp; Vendors typically delete all your personal information the minute it is transferred to a package.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even had to resend my addy a couple times because it got deleted too soon.&nbsp; But once again with that said you can never be to careful.&nbsp; Again from what you tell me i can&#039;t see leo having any desire in you what so ever but just in case the most important thing to always remember is if you get that knock on your door don&#039;t say anything not a word execpt i want to see my lawyer.&nbsp; it can be pretty diificult to prove you purposely orderd drugs and they weren&#039;t sent to you by a pissed ex.&nbsp; Keep your computer clean, amounts light, and you&#039;ll be fine friend :)&nbsp; enjoy!

				There&#039;s no reason to fear having Bitcoin purchases connected to your bank account. They are not illegal, or even shady. The only concern is where you send them. Don&#039;t sens them directly to Silk Road. Move them around first. You&#039;re running them through BitcoinFog, which is good.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sign for any package. That means don&#039;t use shipping options that require signature. Once you&#039;ve signed for it, you&#039;ve claimed ownership.<br /><br />Ideally, don&#039;t open package for a couple days. I realize this advice is laughable if you&#039;re sick. It also means finalizing before you&#039;ve verified contents, but that&#039;s OK because you can edit your feedback later if necessary (you should finalize immediately on delivery, for the vendor&#039;s sake). If no cop comes knocking in a couple days, indulge.<br /><br />And as always, don&#039;t talk to cops. Ask if you&#039;re under arrest. If yes, ask for a lawyer then shut up. If no, ask if you&#039;re being detained (not the same as arrest, but you still can&#039;t walk away). If you&#039;re being detained but not arrested, politely inform cop you have nothing to say, and mean it. If you&#039;re not being detained, wish cop a nice day and close door/walk away.

				With all these precautions you are pretty much good to go. However, if you are not willing to face the consequences of a larger order then maybe its not worth the risk

				there is always a small risk<br /><br />for example<br /><br />when you ordered some drugs from an Vendor<br />and they get busted (like PF or AH)<br />there is in my eyes a High risk that the cops come to you when they found an adress at the vendors PC,<br />in Germany that is in any case so!<br /><br />but in this buisness there are always risks ;)

				Cheers for all the info guys!&nbsp; regarding what fredfirestone said, if your name and address is found on a vendor&#039;s pc, is that actually enough to charge you with?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always thought you had to be caught physically in possession to make anything stick in court, at least in the Land of Tophats and Tea.&nbsp; After all, all the vendor&#039;s PC shows is that someone ordered to you and your address.&nbsp; They can&#039;t prove it was you, and they can&#039;t prove you ever received it, assuming you&#039;re savvy and keep your place and pc spotless.&nbsp; Obviously if they find anything you&#039;re screwed, but without any physical evidence it&#039;s still just an address on a very easily accessible website.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe the CPS would get that into court.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Let&#039;s say you&#039;re not planning on just using for personal. Other than only selling to trusted friends, do you guys have any suggestions for how to protect yourself?

				What I buy is strictly personal. It would just take one guy to roll on me and that&#039;s a risk I&#039;m not willing to take, especially with several years in jail being the risk. Fuck. That. Shit.&nbsp; However, if what you were asking was strictly hypothetical, I&#039;d suggest the usual tactics. Seperate pay-as-you-go phone, a stash location that isn&#039;t your house, use wraps instead of baggies (you can use leaflets people post through your door), keep your scales clean and in the kitchen (so you can say they&#039;re for measuring ingredients), never leave fingerprints on your wraps, insist people call and never text, and don&#039;t keep huge amounts of cash lying about.&nbsp; Also, avoid stuff like heroin, speed and coke, or more precisely, don&#039;t deal to anyone who&#039;s obviously a junkie.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s hypothetical.&nbsp; Even with all those precautions I&#039;d still never do it.&nbsp; You seldom get locked up for possession.&nbsp;
