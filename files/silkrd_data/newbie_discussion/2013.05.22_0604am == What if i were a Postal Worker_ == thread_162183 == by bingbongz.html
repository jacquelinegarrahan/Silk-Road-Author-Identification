				Hey all, have been lurking a while and this is my first post..<br /><br />So lets say hypothetically i was a Postal worker and i was to get SR deliveries to other peoples houses on my daily route.. maybe i could&nbsp; use a diff name or slightly diff spelling. Then when the mail/package arrives, you simply intercept it (when you are totally out of sight obviously)<br /><br />What are peoples thoughts on this idea? is it solid?<br /><br />I can&#039;t really flaw it personally, it removes the need to deliver to your own house/PO box, and if any heat ever comes from it via customs, it will just fall on to the home owner.<br /><br />

				Good idea if you know you have a solid route everyday.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t just use anyone&#039;s name though.&nbsp; Find someone that really deserves the heat if it comes down on them.&nbsp; Pedophile or Sex offender or some shit - most states you can find out EXACTLY what there address is.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t just pick some random name - the SR is about freedom, ultimately, and from what I&#039;ve seen we all try to treat each other with respect on here - and what good would we be if we&#039;re bringing harm onto undeserving people.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway - those are my thoughts.

Like a really old person or a super clean family guy. If the package was found at customs, i highly doubt the cops will try to press charges if it&#039;s clear someone else has been sending the package to the address?

				--think about that for a minute.&nbsp; You don&#039;t KNOW people just by looking at them or Judging them by what kind of lifestyle they need.&nbsp; What would happen if you sent a package to a &quot;Super clean&quot; family and when all hell broke loose on them, they found a stash of some good green and some vicodin they liked to party on a few times a year.&nbsp; Did they deserve that??&nbsp; Or an old person who had some green for cancer or glaucoma in a state where it wasn&#039;t legal???&nbsp; I like the sex offender idea better.&nbsp; 1st time non-violent drug offenders get a more hefty mandatory sentence in the US than offenders of manslaughter, rape, and theft.&nbsp; I say if you get the opportunity, give someone like that a little more.&nbsp; They&#039;re scum.
