				Curious if any top vendors (particularly stealth vendors) would be willing to sell empty packages? as in a regular package just like they normally would but with no substance in it. <br /><br />I know its weird to ask but a potential vendor could just purchase legit package and it&#039;s no biggy. But to save both the vendor and potential vendor any headaches I think this might be easier.

				Flashlight I like your thinking.<br /><br />Registered.. you let me know when you&#039;re a top vendor. No offense meant, but seriously. Learning new, interesting, or different methods of stealth is probably going to involve at least 1 of the parties being a very experienced vendor with many positive reviews on stealth.

				I don&#039;t think vendors who value their stealth would be willing to give out packaging info let alone the packages themselves. Its not wise to give away your secrets.

So rather than waste their time and risk both parties, I&#039;m asking can I pay for an empty package. Shit if I have to buy something from them, so what I buy it.&nbsp; except now IF the package gets stopped and I go to resolution then everyone loses. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=170680.msg1221294#msg1221294">Quote from: flashlight5 on June 10, 2013, 10:52 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">what product do you want to send? <br /><br />btw... im not sure if u liked my idea or where trying to trash it<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The dollar store idea? no I like it. they are filled with a billion and one nick-nack pieces of crap that can be altered. I like to think i&#039;m fairly inventive and smart but I never even considered it. Great place to start.
