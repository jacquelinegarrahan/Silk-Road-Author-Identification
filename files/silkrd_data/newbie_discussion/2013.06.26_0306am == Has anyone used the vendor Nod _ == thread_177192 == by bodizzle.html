				My friend bought some BTH from him. It was great, exactly as advertised and came on time. Definitely a good vendor and worth the price.

				I&nbsp; bought coke from Nod a week or two ago, and it was very good stuff..clean and potent. Even more impressive is the communication and FAST processing and shipping of your order. Nod&#039;s a sure thing, and with express shipping, you won&#039;t be waiting long at all.

				Thanks for the replies guys.<br /><br />I just ordered some coke from him. Sent him 2 messages prior to ordering, but no reply. Decided to just go ahead and order because of his stellar reviews. That was about 3-4 hours ago.. (ordered express as well).<br /><br />I guess he&#039;s just really busy? Im a newbie so I dont know if this is considered to be normal for vendors (periods of communication falloff). <br /><br />Can I ask how long it took for your guy&#039;s orders to show &quot;in transit&quot;?

Your order may be packed and addressed, and just waiting to be dropped in the mail. Also, Nod has to sleep like the rest of us. He might be doing so now! :)

				I thought it was overpriced for quality. Shipping was decent but there are other vendors I would pick before him if I decided to order anything else like that.

				So its been over 12 hours since I ordered. No reply to initial 2 messages I sent him 24 hours ago, and order still says processing.<br /><br />This is still within normal range right?

				He has great product but waay to over priced. If you want some BTH that as almost just as good for HALF the price, Go see vendor &#039;Blackmail&#039; He really hooks you up and the product is great!

				I cant tell if BlownAway is messing with me here when he says &quot;NOPE&quot;.<br /><br />Does anyone else think it is normal to have no reply to messages sent almost 24 hours ago, and no update of an order made almost 12 hours ago? <br /><br />Has anyone experienced something like this with Nod? Feedback greatly appreciated.

Vendors, Just like you, Have things to do IRL. if nothing has changed in 96 hours you can just cancel it! Or ask him to do so if you do not want to wait.<br /><br />Jamin
