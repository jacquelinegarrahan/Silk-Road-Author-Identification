				Hi,<br /><br />wondering if anyone had experience with this, sending down for a festival next weekend, c/o hotels mail/business center<br /><br />sent a package expedited parcel from canada, its been 8 business days and this was the last tracking information<br /><br />from USPS<br /><br />Your item was forwarded to a different address at --. This was because of forwarding instructions or because the address or ZIP Code on the label was incorrect <br /><br />earlier that morning it was arrival at unit, in the destination city<br /><br />from Canada Post<br /><br />Item redirected to recipient&#039;s new address<br /><br />Could anyone clear this up? is this normal, can i expect to recieve the package before thursday?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br /><br />

				When I shipped a package to my hotel in Vegas the tracking said it was &quot;available for pickup&quot;. I freaked out and thought I was screwed. Apparently most big hotels have a P.O. Box and they send runners to go pick up the mail everyday. So it might just be that it was forwarded to that address and is on its way to your hotel.

				I had a package shipped to a hotel in Vegas, called them before I arrived to make sure they receive post for guests. No problems, the day after I checked in the envelope was delivered by room service.

				I&#039;d check with the hotel. Nothing odd about a guest asking if they receive mail. Must happen with people who travel a lot all the time.<br /><br />Guess delivery time might be a little trickier though. If you&#039;re there for 2 weeks fine, but if you only stay 2 nights and the delivery is late...
