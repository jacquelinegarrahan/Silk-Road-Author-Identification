				I&#039;ve received things from Spain no probs.. I don&#039;t think customs there are tighter than in the EU, Spain has rather lax drug laws.

				hm but you received from and not to Spain? Since Spain get A LOT of coke from Colombia and hash from Morocco it seems like they should have a pretty hard working customs.&nbsp; I might be wrong there tho

				Well yeah but that&#039;s the only input I can give you. Usually customs work both ways, they don&#039;t only check things going in. Spain is as you said the entry point of hash into Europe.. It makes sense customs are tighter from Spain to the EU than from the EU into Spain. Just like things coming from the Netherlands are also more suspicious, but not really things going in from the EU.<br />As a general rule, EU -&gt; EU is really safe, except for the Nordic countries. You can order domestic if you&#039;re worried though.
