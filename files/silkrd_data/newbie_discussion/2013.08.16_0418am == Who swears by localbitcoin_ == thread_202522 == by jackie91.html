				Localbitcoins.com is been my go to since I decided I wasn&#039;t going to be taken advantage of anymore and left in the dark by the guys over at Bitinstant. Localbitcoin not only offers face to face meetings, but cash deposits as well at certain banks. You can also use a Dwolla account. This site uses an escrow system and a claims department.

				It&#039;s great because it has escrow.&nbsp; I don&#039;t swear by the site (I&#039;ve heard of even vendors getting scammed out of 10k+ through the non f2f transactions), but I swear by my local vendor.&nbsp; He is one of the coolest guys I have met, and is just selling bitcoins and making a very comfortable amount of $.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to be scammed in a public place with f2f unless the whole place literally gets robbed.&nbsp; I say almost only because nothing is impossible :)

				I am sold! I should be able to do a f2f as I live near a fairly large (understatement) city. I did see where there were some transactions that had escrow protection. This gives me the war and fuzzies!<br />About Bitinstant...They are shut down at the moment b/c of the increasing attention btc is getting. They have to prove to the feds they aren&#039;t laundering money. However by being down for so long they are losing their relevance. People will find other places (localbitcoin for example) to get coin and bitinstant won&#039;t be able to compete b/c of losing a lot of their customer base to others. I think they aren&#039;t long for this world.

				Apart from the 1st couple of times(when I bought them on SR), I have got all my coin from a single trader at LBtc, never any trouble.&nbsp; I use bank transfer because I am only buying personal amounts on SR and all the face to face vendors nearby still wanted to verify my phone number etc, so would not have been anon anyway.&nbsp; I usually have my coins within a few minutes of doing the bank transfer, the longest wait was under half an hour.&nbsp; It always takes much longer for the coin to show in my SR account than it does for it to show in my LBtc wallet.

				Here ya go:<br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/cashforbtc/<br /><br />He&#039;s great. It looks like he only has Canadian banks up right now... when I bought from him a week ago, I bought $900 in btc by depositing the funds into Bank of America, then I bought about $1k by depositing funds into Wells Fargo.<br /><br />He&#039;s really cool - you might want to just message him and ask if he will let you deposit in Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or another US bank... that is, if you are in the US. If you are in Canada you&#039;re good.

				It&#039;s the shit if there&#039;s a vendor near you. I just message the guy and then meet him at a local wifi spot. He scans my QR with his phone and sends the coin while I wait.
