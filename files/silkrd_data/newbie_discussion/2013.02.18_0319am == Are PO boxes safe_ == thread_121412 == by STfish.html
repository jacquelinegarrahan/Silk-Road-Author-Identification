				I was just wondering everyones input on this, i&#039;m probably going to get a small PO box and have MDMA shipped there, but I read that if the package doesn&#039;t fit in the box that you have to take a note up to a counter to get it do you guys think that would lead to problems? I also read that you don&#039;t have to put your name down when getting a package sent to a PO box, just the number of the box, anyone have experience with PO boxes? I can&#039;t get it shipped to my house for various reasons and I don&#039;t have any &quot;friends&quot; I could trust with the amount i&#039;m going to buy.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />STfish

				PO boxes are like condoms, they are safe if you use them right.. first of all there is WAY TOO MUCH MAIL for your local post office slacker to investage your mail. but if you wanna do things right, open a PO box in a fake overseas business name and use a mail forwarding service. and better yet buy a PO box and start your own re mailing service that way if gor some odd chance you do get caught with a package of dope you can say that you were re mailing it.

				SWAG the fuck out and order a shit ton of things to your PO box like magazines and other dumb shit then they wont think its strange to get a weird package every once in a while, and honestly pigs are not worried about the buyers, they are after the sellers. cuase you cant buy dope if its not for sale

				Good thing you asked about this, I was curious myself. How do others have their packages sent to them? I.e. do they put their home address down with a probable but fake name?

				Does anyone know ANYONE who has ever been stung by LE over drugs via mail? (P.O. Box or otherwise?)&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing this for 5 years now and I&#039;ve never heard a news story or a friend telling me about any time that has happened (with one exception of this dumbass sending weed to himself via UPS with sig required and flying back at the same time).<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Actually, I did read a story online about a Ketamine dealer who got stung at (I think) at a USPS franchise store. It actually wasn&#039;t clear where the sting happened, but it alluded to the fact that it was at his P.O. Box. But he also said the sting happened because of outside drama - as they almost always do. You piss off a friend or GF or BF or competitor who knows what you do and how you do it and they rat you out. Probably 90% of all drug busts could be avoided if people would do two things: don&#039;t drive while doing ANYTHING illegal (seriously! smoking an L while driving may make you feel like a baller, but it&#039;s literally the number 1 way to get caught), and stop fucking telling people how and where you do what you do. If no one knows, no one can rat.<br /><br />
