				I&#039;m opening this thread as a harm reduction point<br />My questions are <br />1. How much citric acid we add to cook our H and what citric acid we use ( needle exchange powder, fresh lemon juice, etc...)<br />2. Which syringes are better for IV&#039;ing - 2ml ones with bigger needle or 1ml ones - insuline type ones, I&#039;ve read that insuline type ones are not designed for iv and harm our veins a lot<br />3. How do we strengthen our H, if we do<br />&nbsp;As to me,<br />1. I try to put as little as I can (i use needle&nbsp; exchane powder) because im afraid i&#039;d burn my veins if it&#039;s too acidic, but sometimes if i don&#039;t add enough, there is lots of sediments at the end, and if I repeat the process, adding more CA, everything dizolvs, don&#039;t know whether its correct<br />2. I tried to use 2ml ones as much as I could but killed bigger veins injecting crushed tablets ( all trombed), so insuline ones are the only option for me now&nbsp; as it&#039;s difficult to find a vein<br />3. I don&#039;t strengthen my H at the moment and never did but heard that it&#039;s good to mix it with benzos. What is the dosage by the way? And what benzos are the best?<br />Sorry for my english ( it&#039;s not my mother tongue)

				1-try using vit-c.it doesnt harm the vein as much.if using citric use as much as it takes and no more.be carefull if you have to use lemon juice at it can have fungus in it.I used a lime twice and both times all my skin went red like a rash and was itchy for about half an hour<br />2-be careful mixing benzos with your h!!this is one easy way to O.D. also you tend to wake up in police cells not knowing what you&#039;ve done or like me,show up at the front door at 4:00am wearing nothing but boxers telling my misses &quot;move aside bitch,I&#039;m going to bed!&quot; was getting some nasty stares from her the next morning as I was asking her where my trousers were as I was late for work and couldnt remember a thing from the night before.
