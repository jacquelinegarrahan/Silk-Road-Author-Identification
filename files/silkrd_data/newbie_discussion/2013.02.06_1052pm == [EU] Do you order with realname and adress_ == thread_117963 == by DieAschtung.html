				Hi. This is mostly a question towards europeans.<br /><br />Ive had the mentallity that its pretty safe to order with your realname and adress, because I always thought if it was taken in custom, nothing would happen (except no package) since how could they prove that it was you who had actually ordered it.<br /><br />However after doing some reaserch it seems like infact, people do get prosecuted for ordering things online when the custom take the item. Ofc every country have their own rules but iam sure others do the same.<br /><br />So, do you order with real info? If so are u not affraid of my concerns? If you dont use real info, how do u order?

				I use my real name and address, although I&#039;ve only made (and waiting on) one international order so I haven&#039;t needed to worry about customs so far. I think for the most part, if they find a bit of weed or a small amount of a drug you&#039;ll get a love letter from customs rather than a knock on the door from the police. You&#039;ll really only need to worry when you&#039;re ordering a sizable amount so it&#039;d be worth the police pursuing.

				Get an ID on here. It helps to up your purchase count if your new, AND you can get a po box with it. Not really totally necessary if you take precautions, but every layer of protection adds to your security. Remember, were relatively safe here, but dont get too cocky. Folks dissappear from here all the time. Nobodys bulletproof. Im not preaching paranoia, but always keep it in your mind what the risks are.

				No, you don&#039;t need to use real name. Address of course has to be real.<br />It depends a lot on where you live. Is it separate house or apartment complex? I have the &quot;luck&quot; to live in an apartment complex, there are separate mailboxes for each resident and a general box where most stuff gets dropped in, because the mailman never bothers to search every mailbox. Most buildings here are that way and of course the mailman has absolutely no clue who lives in each building. So name doesn&#039;t matter. Now if you live in a house there&#039;s a chance the mailman will see the name doesn&#039;t fit with other mail delivered to this house so it&#039;s a bit tricky, but at least in my country that wouldn&#039;t make a difference. EU is not US. Use common sense and a bit of knowledge of post office methods and you ll find what to do.

				It depends whether you are a dealer or only buy amounts for personal use.<br /><br />If you buy for personal ( ie small amounts ) you may as well just use your real name and address. A caught letter will not result in anything else than a note that the contents have been seized. No EU country that I know of will start an investigation over 10 lsd blotters or 2 grams of coke.<br />Using a fake name or address makes the risk of the mail being lost or returned to sender (which is the same as lost) much greater and just calls attention to the letter (ie makes it more suspicious).<br /><br />If you are buying amounts that are beyond what is considered for personal use -then it is a whole other story.<br />There are a whole series of precautions to take - of which not using your real address is just one.<br /><br />Anyway ensure you know the rules of the country youre in. In my country for instance 49 blotters of lsd = personal use = no prosecution, 50 = prosecution.<br />Ordering 49 the very worst that can happen is an administrative fine - in practice if a personal amount is found in mail it is just confiscated and you will get a note to that effect. Le is not going to bother trying to prove that you ordered it just to smack you with an administrative fine.

				I use a fake name, with my real address.<br /><br />Plenty of people will jump-in and say &quot;noooo, using a fake name raises red flags... blah blah...&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />This is total bollocks.<br /><br />I shall explain.<br /><br /><br />Think about this. How the hell, does the postman know who is living in my house?<br />The postman looks at the house number, street name and postcode(zip code). Then he puts it through the appropriate letter box. <br /><br />Using a fake name adds a layer of security.<br />When your package arrives, you&#039;ll know what it is because of the fake name. All you have to do is write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on the envelope, and leave it unopened for a few days, just in-case by some miracle the package was inspected and delivered anyway.<br />That way, if you DO get a visit from the boys in blue, you have a strong case of plausable denial on your side.<br /><br />&quot;no officer, no-one here by that name. Here, check my ID. I was just gonne send it back&quot;. <br /><br />This is how I do it. And it&#039;s by far, the safest way to receive goods. <br />

I admit that at shared housing, it&#039;s not ideal. But even then, do all the people in the apartments know each other by name? Aren&#039;t the individual boxes numbered?

				If you use you&#039;re real name and address you have more chance that it will arrives. Because customs can check if the name is registered on that address. If it isn&#039;t, it will make the package suspicious. And don&#039;t worry about small amounts.&nbsp;
