				Hey, I am not a newbie. I have been on the road for a while NEVER BEEN SCAMMED till today. I gave JumboMonkeyBiscuit(100) a MP for $500 and he cancelled my order after cashing the money and told me the balance is zero I must have given the number to someone else. BS! No one else has the number but him. I called MP and they said it was cashed an hour after I sent him the info. I even told him I felt bad for his grandpa dying. I am a nice person and now I got screwed. The only reason I used him because of his awesome stats but don&#039;t be fooled. You cant leave a bad stat if he cancels your order. Now I opened up a ticket with MP to track down where the number was used, apparently they can do that now. <br /><br />Just giving you guys a waning.

				Everyone who has EVER used our services knows full well that we are not scammers nor do we intend to move in that direction.&nbsp; I have stayed in communication with you this whole time...I have been happy to answer any of your questions....You provided me with a moneypak...I tried to process the moneypak...It had a zero balance on it....I&#039;ve offered you suggestions and resources to try to get it resoved with Greendot...I&#039;ve even offered to help....I&#039;ve advised you to stay in touch so IF in fact there was an issue with activation we can complete the transaction....I&#039;m NOW in communication with you HERE telling you the SAME thing I&#039;ve BEEN telling you....I don&#039;t steal people&#039;s money...I didn&#039;t steal YOUR money....I&#039;m NOT going to forward the coins for FREE!!&nbsp; Ironically, I just received threats from a new bitcoin scammer saying that if I tried to do ANYTHING to hurt his accounts....report his accounts...or warn my customers he would do what he had to do to hurt JmB including getting my PO Box so he can send me a bomb lol...Taaadaaaaa....I guess this is the begninng.&nbsp; If you truly thought I had your money...and I have been in touch with you the whole time trying to assist in resolving this....why would you tie up the funds and prevent any coin transfer at all??&nbsp; My suggestion is to either stop trolling...OR stop giving your codes to more than one vendor so you atleast know who has access to your money!!!!&nbsp; Since you and Greendot supposedly have this all figured out, please do not continue to try to destroy JmB&#039;s hard earned reputation until you KNOW without a doubt what happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />JmB

				I doubt JMB scammed you. It has be a mix up somewhere or like he said someone else had the moneypak code first. I just used JMB for $1,000.00 moneypak yesterday and had my coins in about an hour. I have used JumboMonkeyBiscuit for at least 4 Cash to Bitcoin transactions and have not had a problem to date. <br />I hope you get this straight. Keep us posted how it turns out.<br /><br />Greendot sucks by the way&nbsp; :)

				lol...and how do you suggest I word it?&nbsp; Should I get defensive and childish?&nbsp; &nbsp;There is only ONE uniform way to effectively communicate a point?&nbsp; Your responses at this point are laughable. I have nothing to hide and I laid everything out on the table....that does not automatically mean guilt...It&#039;s becoming clearer and clearer this is a troll post and all the multiple personalities will soon be responding lol.&nbsp; What a joke. lol Scammers steal money as long and as fast as they can...Every time a scammer pops up and I get reports from customers saying they&#039;ve been scammed, I get on here and shout it from the rooftops... I&#039;ve been actively doing business on SR for months...I have over 600 5 out of 5 ratings...This is the ONLY complaint and it&#039;s right after a REAL scammer makes threats to do exactly this.

				My experience with JMB.........I have done over 50 transactions with him by selling him bitcoins that can then be recycled back into SR......just like sugarmamma use to do........this guy is NOT a scammer.<br /><br />My feeling is with MP.....things happen all the time....codes are wrong......codes that are given at the cash register were not put in correctly and will not work...when trying to load......it all happens.....even the employees of the place where you get the codes could of stolen them.......every transaction we do with JMB is done with pgp......I insist on it.......just for this very reason......so what ever happened....JMB did not<br />scam anyone...........why the fuck would he.......shit the guy does like 5-10k a day in business with a 100 rating an HAS been doing it for 2 months...........my experience tells me that things happen with that method of payment all the time......and not saying the OP is trying to scam JMB.......but......that is also possible....<br /><br />and then for all you people to just jump on something that you were not involved in or know nothing about is pathetic really.......I mean seriously......come on guys<br /><br />Let MP straighten it out......that is the process.......I have had that same problem before....and it was the original seller&#039;s problem.....that was determined by MP.....for this OP to come on here and call someone a scammer is bullshit.........you have a process........with MP......go through that process.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				For the record, I sent JMB an untracked envelope full of cash this week, and had my coins in my account two days later.&nbsp; Pretty sure if he was a scammer, I would have found out.&nbsp; He&#039;s a straight shooter.&nbsp; The OP is either an idiot, scammer or troll.<br /><br />

				I too can attest to JMB&#039;s quality. He&#039;s always came through for me. I highly doubt he scammed you or is a scammer. Furthermore, I highly recommend that anybody who needs btc sold/bought use JMB. He&#039;s perfect. <br /><br />Glad to see you&#039;re getting support on here JMB, we all know what&#039;s up.

				i saw this topic yesterday and almost freaked out, it was right after i sent my 1st vanilla reload to JMB<br />sure enough, a few hours later the coins were in my account. im really happy i found him as it seems like the easiest way to get coins<br /><br />i hope you can get to the bottom of what actually happened. sometimes the cashiers are dumb also, i got a friend an amex gift card once and the person never activated it. i looked like an idiot for his birthday.

				I have been on the road for months now, this is my first post though! I do so just to support JMB<br /><br />Now, JMB, he is a STRAIGHT UP, legit businessman. <br /><br />Example; I told him I was&nbsp; sending a certain amount of cash (over 1k$) for BTC.... I had accidentally miscounted my money, and JMB actually stepped forward, messaged me about it, and made sure I got every bit of BTC that was owed to me. His service is flawless,&nbsp; &nbsp;he is honest, and just talking to him would resolve any issue. I don&#039;&#039;t buy for ONE SECOND that JMB scammed you; you are a fucking liar. Why are you trying to hurt the mans good name? He is honest, responds in a short time, and is completely trustworthy. JMB =&nbsp; 8)

				Hey Guys. ive gotta throw some weight behind JMB. many flawless transactions. Ive recommended him to many here in the forums and will continue. look his record speaks for him. also a loyal base of clients who will help him if the time comes. look how many are showin up here on forums. If you worry about the JMB you might as well get off the road as there is not one better vendor out there, period. fuck scammers thieves and liars.
