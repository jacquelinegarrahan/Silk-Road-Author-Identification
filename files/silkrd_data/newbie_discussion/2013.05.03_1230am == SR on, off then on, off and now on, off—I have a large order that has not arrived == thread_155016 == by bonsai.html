				I placed an order with a vendor last Tuesday for an Express delivery. It was a large order. He finally got back to me last Friday after I had sent a couple messages and told me he had shipped that day. Tuesday rolls around, no order. I PM him here on the forum and he says he couldn&#039;t contact me (due to not knowing my alias ...?) to tell me he had made a mistake on addressing the package and it was returned. He said he would ship today to arrive tomorrow and supply the dcn so I know it was done. Today rolls around, no message, no dcn, no reply to my PM. Can&#039;t get on SR to go to resolution so my order won&#039;t auto finalize. I&#039;m out a bunch of money. And this is from a vendor with a stellar rep whose been a member over a year, someone who I&#039;ve done business with before. I have perfect stats, no scam on my part, all I want is my order!<br /><br />Vendors, if you promise you&#039;re going to do something, do it! Communication and subsequent action build trust and lead to your business expanding. Such a fundamental business practice one learns taking Business 101.<br /><br />I&#039;m pissed. I&#039;ve been waiting for 9 days now. I understand SR has been up and down, but I checked the vendor in question&#039;s activity and saw that he had been on SR the day my order was placed as well as the day before he contacted me to say he would ship my order on Friday Express. After his PM last night apologizing and saying it would go out today and he would give me the dcn, I thought maybe all would be well. BUT HE DIDN&#039;T DO WHAT HE HAD PROMISED. I&#039;m pissed.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me vent ...

				You can get onto SR. Currently there are issues with building circuits, but the site itself is up and fine. If you can&#039;t connect to SR try again in fifteen minutes, or keep&nbsp; sotpping/starting TOR and then trying until you can build a circuit to the server. <br /><br />Your order will most certainly auto finalize as it&#039;s not currently off.

				Yeah I feel your pain. I am waiting on an order from about 2 weeks ago to arrive. But relax and have faith. I still have yet to be screwed by SR or their vendors. I am sure your shit will come man, just keep the faith :)

				I was finally able to get on, no messages, and when I checked my orders page, I found out I still have 4 days until I can click &quot;resolve.&quot; But with the spotty ability of getting on SR lately, I&#039;m nervous that I won&#039;t be able to resolve the transaction. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m overreacting about the resolve issue, but this up and down access to SR has me catastrophizing.<br /><br />What really pisses me off is the neanderthal business practices I&#039;ve encountered here on SR. With about 30 transactions under my belt, about a third of them had some issue, none though like the current one I&#039;m ranting about.<br /><br />Damn, I need my drugs to mellow me out ... ;)

				honestly man there are very few businesses that run smoothly 100% of the time.&nbsp; Im confident all vendors have IRL obligations, and things can get mixed around.&nbsp; The biggest thing that has helped me is just trying to be paitient.&nbsp; It is very stresssful and annoying but all you do is make yourself angrier for a reason you cannot control.&nbsp;
