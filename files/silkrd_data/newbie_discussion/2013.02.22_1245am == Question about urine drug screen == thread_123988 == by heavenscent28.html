				The only thing I am worried about is pot. I only smoke on the weekends and very little at that (probably .3-.4g total). I have been clean 28 days. I work out about 3.5hrs a week. On Sunday I passed an athome test using my second void and on Monday I passed one using my first void. Monday afternoon, I took a UA and the results came back too diluted. Retest Friday. Can I use my first void for the test? Other ideas?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hmm. Well I don&#039;t think I will go that route because if it comes back diluted, I am fucked. Given I have passed 2 Walgreens tests and how long its been, I am leaning towards me being okay. Thanks tho.

If you did pass it was by some magical fluke.<br /><br />To the OP, your system should be clear by now its more of an extreme case thing where people take more time than that to completely detox. Only exercise and time can clear your body. But just for some practical evidence so you know you are clear I&#039;ll tell you my experience. My buddies and I smoked everyday of our lives from about the end of 10th grade past graduation. I got accepted into a school that I knew drug testes . I was leaving Julyfirst, I was 18, I weighed about 180 and was 5&#039;8. <br />My last day smoking was June 6th and I ordered about 15 home drug tests from Amazon. I exercised very frequently, drank tons of water, and took vitamins just because vitamins were good for me anyway not because I thought it would cleanse my system. I drug tested myself twice per week and finally passed on June 28th. <br />So long story short after being a chronic user for two years I passed a drug test in 22 days. I am now still at this school and am subject to random drug testing, but they never drug test on weekednds, so when I do coke or molly on friday nights I am always good by monday.<br />Anyway your system is clear you will pass your drug test.

				dilution is not a safe technique, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#039;t.<br />But your system is definitely clear, if you want to dilute just to be extra extra safe go for it, because even if they retest you you will be clean. Next time you are researching for a drug test I suggest you do your own research based on scientific facts instead of just asking other people what they did. I use to read posts about this all the time on many different forums and people have some STUPID ideas that they swear works but if you do the research none of it works. You&#039;ll here drinking bleach, drinking vinegar, taking cranberry pills, none of that works. The THC is bonded to your fat cells, nothing will cleanses your fat cells and as those cells die they enter your blood stream and eventually your urine. So how would any of these stupid techniques clean your system. Exercise cleanses you faster because it burns your fat and causes you to excrete the THC more quickly. Please do nt listen to the idiots on some of these forums, if they passed using these stupid techniques they either did not smoke as much as they say they did, they got insanely lucky, or they are just liars.

Yea a lot of the shit I have read seems kinda stupid but its nice to get some reassurance especially right now because I am also in the process of quitting tobacco and it has been a double whamy.

				I just want to tell you, I have been there before, and I know how much it sucks. But if all you say is true, not only that you work out BUT especially if you&#039;ve not smoked at all for 28 days, then dude... you can kick me in the nuts if you don&#039;t pass, that&#039;s all. That&#039;s how confident I am. That&#039;s like the maximum of how long it would take for even some of the most chronic smokers... unless you are like really fat I guess. But anyway, yeah, you will likely be just fine. JUST DON&#039;T SMOKE until you are confidently past the hurdle anyway. Good luck buddy --

				You should be fine in any case if you are being truthful about your use.&nbsp; Cannaboids are stored in body fat and readily disappear in a couple weeks with low use people.&nbsp; You shouldnt need to polute yourself with anything in order to pass. A hair test would be a totally different matter.

				Agree with most on this topic. I smoke once or twice a month at most and took a piss test 13 days after smoking once and passed. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re fine.

				TAKE A VITAMIN IN THE MORNING. Or about five or six hours before and do not go to the bathroom. Your pee will come out neon yellow.
