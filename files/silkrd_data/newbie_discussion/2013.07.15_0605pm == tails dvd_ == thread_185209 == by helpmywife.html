				I think i understood that....<br /><br />When you download tails it comes in DVD ISO format.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to burn the DVD before you put on the USB stick though. That&#039;s just the documented way to do it.&nbsp; DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW will work just as long as your writer accepts the format.<br /><br />Here are you options:<br /><br />&nbsp;1. Burn the ISO to a DVD. Boot from the DVD and install to the USB.<br />&nbsp;2. Use UNetBootIn(http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) to move the DVD to a USB.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried this with tails but since tails is Ubuntu based it would probably work.<br />&nbsp;3. Use a Virtual Machine like VMWare or Virtualbox to boot from the ISO and install it to the USB.

				&nbsp;review meatgrinder&#039;s post about 3 or 4 posts down on the first page of&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0<br /><br />worked like a champ for me - do review Fallkniven&#039;s instructions on boot priority - i spent 12-15 hours over 3 days, couldn&#039;t get my computer to boot up in tails - would always go to windows 7 - changed boot priority to external device first, then cd tray then hdd, - when there&#039;s no bootable usb or a boot cd in the tray, computer skips those and goes to the hdd to boot like normal, into windows<br /><br />one other tip - when burning to dvd, use the windows native app, think it was &quot;Windows media manager&quot;, ie as opposed to Roxio etc, and check the &quot;verify&quot; box before burning.<br /><br />one thing that threw me, no matter what i did, when i would clik on the computer icon (upper left desktop) after an install, it wouldn&#039;t recognize the usb drive. If i&#039;d go into storage disk management, it&#039;d be there. But it doesn&#039;t matter so ignore that aspect- it boots - have done it now about 20 times, on my desktop and my laptop and works like a champ<br /><br /><br />hope that helps

				what i dont understand is am i just putting a copy of TAILS on the DVD+R. and once its burned on there i can move it to USB stick. If thats true is it also possible to download straight to burning it? probly not, gotta download it THEN burn it!? sorry im so burnt about this guys also WHY O WHY do i need 2 USB sticks?<br /><br />one last thing truecrypt will give me the ability to encrypt up to 4gb on the USB stick right?

				There are applications that will let you download and burn simultaneously... but i wouldn&#039;t recommend it. <br /><br />Tails is a LiveDVD which means you can run it from the DVD or Install it. From the instructions i&#039;ve seen on the Tails website it can installed to a USB Stick.<br /><br />The reason why the instructions say 2 USB sticks is because they are not burning to a DVD.&nbsp; The first USB Stick is just the DVD in a USB format. The second DVD is where you are installing tails permanently.<br /><br />A truecrypt volume can be any size.&nbsp; The 4GB limit is based on the File System.&nbsp; For example Windows 98 used FAT32 as it&#039;s file system and the largest file was 4GB.&nbsp; Windows XP and on used NTFS which can have&nbsp; a much larger single file..<br /><br />If tails uses FAT32 then 4GB will be the limit.&nbsp; Most bootable USB sticks are FAT32.&nbsp; Only way around it is if you are familiar with Linux
