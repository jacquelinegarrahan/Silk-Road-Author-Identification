				You have recently used an archived Bitcoin address (xxx) to deposit xxx BTC to your account. This address could be retired at any time. It is strongly advised that you use a new bitcoin address for future deposits.<br /><br />What does this mean? Is this a security hazard?

				Click on your account tab and create a new address for deposit. It&#039;s not a security risk per se. You should create a new address for deposit often, some say every time.<br /><br />The only danger is if they retire the address and it no longer is able to receive BTC then you are sending your money into the void.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC transfers are not reversable, so if it goes to a non-existant address your money is gone.<br /><br />I have heard that money sent to old addresses will still go to your account, but this message seems to suggest otherwise.<br /><br />Either way, just make a new address for next time amd you&#039;re good.<br /><br />Oh, and Coinbase is a security risk if you have verified.yoir account with real details. You now have a paper trail that could link you to SR.
