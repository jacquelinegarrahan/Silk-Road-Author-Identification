That was dope.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t agree with you more.........Nobody should ever FE!!! How fuckin stupid is that? You FE and then get scammed and you&#039;re fucked......and this thing about vendors blackballing buyers because a buyer rightfully expects that vendors behave in a professional manner is utter bullshit! That&#039;s sort of like McDonalds blackballing a guy because he complained when he saw the cook shitting in his Big Mac!!!! If a vendor sends you bunk, or changes the deal midstream, or sits on your order for a week before shipping it, they deserve bad feedback!! As long as it&#039;s honest.......I, like you, have been a buyer for a long time, but haven&#039;t spent much time on the forum.&nbsp; Well OP my man, we need to spend more time on the forums and fight back against these scoundrels.&nbsp; Just make sure you also give credit where credit is due. I&#039;ll out the pigs I do business with and you do the same.&nbsp; THANKS FOR THE CALL TO ARMS OPMAN !!!!

				Some good points here <br />*FE - the main one and how a lot of vendors scam, the best way to keep safe is if you dont want to FE then dont its their for your protection.<br />* If they have their products pegged to btc and dont have the price change with the fluctatioins then just avoid that vendor, the best vendors have their settings so when the btc price changes their product price changes too. The price of btc never should affect if you can use SR or not<br /><br />Although a lot of your points are true there are still a lot of good vendors, just take your time to look. Your right , the good will shine through and word will spread about the rotten apples...

				I broadly speaking agree with the original post: as a newcomer myself I assume that I&#039;ve got my share of responsibility about the fact that this place is becoming less of a close-knit underground group, and I understand that sellers must be wary of make-new-buyer-account-rip-off-seller-and-run scammers.

That&#039;s OK in my book. You&#039;re making easier for me to decide for a vendor, and if somebody trusts my blank slate and delivers quality, I&#039;m bound to repeat with them. Maybe in the future I&#039;ll try buying from you. Maybe not. Whoever sells to me assumes the potential risk of being scammed and then reaps the benefits of me not being an asshole.<br /><br />Forcing customers to finalize early, thus making escrow pointless? That harms the whole system, bro. If you can&#039;t really assume the risk of being scammed you may try limiting newbies to buying smaller and cheaper quantities of your product and leave your regular listings for more trusted buyers. But better ignoring newbies altogether than forcing them to finalize early, IMO.

But I just have to say, that since I can&#039;t hunt a seller down, I&#039;m basically fucked if I get ripped.&nbsp; I once got fucked on eBay of all places.&nbsp; This POS had great feedback on 30-40 shitty little items and then listed many very expensive items one day.&nbsp; Since there was no escrow system on eBay at that time, his account was only guaranteed by eBay up to a $500 refund on the item&#039;s he never sent.&nbsp; I paid $2,000 for the non-existent item, so I was basically out $1,500. I didn&#039;t even get it that bad. He took numerous other people for $2K to $4K. In total, he collected something like $70,000 in payments. Nobody got a fuckin thing from him.&nbsp; I spoke to the detectives thousands of mile aways from me in Maryland (USA), but the fuzz barely bothered to look for him.&nbsp; I learned an expensive lesson.&nbsp; If you fuck up a shipment or make some other mistake, do you threaten to blackball buyers for bad feedback?

				I whole heartedly concur!&nbsp; Even for trusted vendors like flaxceed it&#039;s not cool.&nbsp; It messes up the system and can potentialy fuck us as buyers.&nbsp; What if he one day decided to go scammer after building up this lengthy record of good sales?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some vendors offer cheaper prices if you do choose to FE which is good.&nbsp; It gets them their money quicker if you are comfortable with that option and it makes your product cheaper.&nbsp; But those guys don&#039;t force it on you.&nbsp; You can choose it if you want.&nbsp; I just wish sellers weren&#039;t alowed to force it on you.&nbsp; I also despise being threatened to be blacklisted for leaving bad feedback.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recently had a very bad experience with a vendor who sold me weak product and have been worried that if I put honest feedback I wont be able to buy anything from good vendors.&nbsp; So I come here to try and tell the masses to not buy his product but then I get shunted in here with the spammers.&nbsp; :(

				it&#039;s kind of weird seeing this. maybe it&#039;s because it got so famous? I dunno. I&#039;m a new vendor and never ask for FE. Don&#039;t even want it. But I&#039;m not here I&#039;m over at BMR (see sig) and most other shrooms vendors over there don&#039;t require FE either. I had to go there since they upped the fees to 500 bucks<br /><br />maybe it&#039;s because most vendors here have been here since before they raised the price to 500 bucks a couple months ago and have become complacent?. I dunno, but there are hungry vendors like me that do good service and already have some good feedback<br /><br />only thing is over at BMR it&#039;s only a small percentage of traffic, so it&#039;s slower. This is more like a madhouse. LOL. Is this to say that vendors here that do it proper and don&#039;t require FE do better than those who don&#039;t?. Is it really working out that way?

				I&#039;ve been both a buyer &amp; a seller on SR for way over a year now as well, &amp; personally, I don&#039;t think things are any worse for buyers now than they used to be, overall. If anything, I think SR is BETTER for buyers these days. Remember back when if you had less than ten successful purchases practically EVER vendor would insist someone FE? Hell, when I first joined SR there weren&#039;t any vendors at all selling Meth or Crack. Buyers get more respect these days, as well as a much larger selection of products to choose to purchase &amp; selection of vendors to choose to deal with. <br />Of course, one thing I really really don&#039;t like (who wouuld?) about SR these days when compared to &quot;old school SR&quot; is that despite the drastic increase in vendors, I feel the prices have gotten higher. Also, I&#039;m still angry at SR for creating that rule against guns being sold on SR. That&#039;s just beyond ridiculous.

SR has taken so much care continuously to create &amp; maintain a WORKING system that prevents scamming (or at least the definite majority of it), &amp; it just horrifies &amp; perplexes me to see how many people CHOOSE to COMPLETELY waive their rights to escrow of all things.

				On FE: Do not FE on any amount that you are not willing to take a risk on. I believe that if you choose a vendor with a 99-100 rating with many hundreds of transactions and you scan the boards to make sure that recent orders have been fulfilled than your risk is minimal. You will also save money because the vendor does not have to wait for payment, thus they can buy and move more product in less time.<br /><br />So would I FE on an Oz of weed from NorthWestDirect for example: Yes<br /><br />Would I FE on 100g&#039;s of mdma from OldAmsterdam: Not a chance in hell!<br /><br />My .02

				I think that the Road is doing well but that bad apple sellers need to be booted out as soon as they start to get multiple feedbacks of 1 or 2 of 5. . . Obviously something is wrong there and it would be better for everyone if they were refunded their seller fee and kicked off. I think there is too much incentive $$ for SR owners to keep shady vendors around because they get commission no matter what!&nbsp; <br /><br />Shipping needs to be held to a higher standard. . . Here I am waiting on a priority letter from Indubitably that was supposed to go out Monday morning, and it is Friday and I have NO mail today from the Road. Such Bullshit! The guy is not good about replying to messages either, that is AFTER you buy from him. Priority usually would be here wednesday or thursday if sent on Monday morning from anywhere in the USA so I doubt he sent it Monday though I ordered last Saturday and he said it would go out Monday first thing. <br /><br />That is assuming he sent anything at all. . . Overall he has good feedback and I thought he &quot;had the kinks worked out&quot; of his shipping times but this is not a 5/5 transaction with no communication and super long wait for Priority mail. <br /><br />And tracking numbers, should be available to buyers after a day or two at the latest. Sure, some idiots will use TOR to track their packages but still. . . I bought it, I want to know where the fuck it is yeah? Only seller I see giving buyers their tracking info is DragonCove and I cannot afford his stuff right now. <br /><br />And What The Fuck is up with $250, $300 for a gram of Heroin? The sellers are paying $50-60 a G for tar, and $80-100 for #4 ECP at the very most and then selling it for 3 to 4 times their cost? That really sucks. Tar should be $125 and ECP should be $180, we need more competition in the Heroin sales area here.

				New vendor here who is hoping to be part of the cure and not the disease.&nbsp; I find it amazing how people do business these days, not just on the road but everywhere you look.&nbsp; In a global market with competitors popping up every day, customer service is number one.&nbsp; I repeat, customer service is number one.&nbsp; If you are running a business and this sentiment is not running through your head at all times, than you will not be successful, period.&nbsp; As far as the road is concerned I can understand vendors who are picky with their buyers, but not to the point of being assholes.&nbsp; As a vendor you must protect yourself and staff first, and if that means not making a sale based on whatever reasons then so be it, but I would say at least have the professionalism to let the buyer know why you made such a decision.<br /><br />As far as FE, I do not require it, but I am not totally against it either especially when it come to large orders.&nbsp; For large orders I would ask for a deposit on the order, not necessarily FE.&nbsp; I hear a lot of people blasting FE, but I believe if used correctly and with trusted vendors the risk are minimal.

				OP this is a great thread! Thank you for being the brave one to speak up for the rest of us! I just made my first successful order on the road and received it today. Shipping + Communication was amazing. I am glad that there are still some vendors on here who value customer service. I have read so many Vendor profiles before making my first purchase, and it feels like as a new buyer you are kind of limited form where you can buy. I feel every customer should be treated equally just as if they would be in real life. Nothing is stopping me from shopping elsewhere.<br /><br />As far as FE, I can only see that being necessary on huge/expensive orders, but even still i would advise against that. Maybe if you have a history with this Vendor then it is OK, otherwise stay away. I think it would be cool if SR could implement a way to FE yet still stay in escrow. I don&#039;t know how that would be done, but I am sure there is a way...<br /><br />And finally as for attitudes. WOW. Some Vendors on here really have a stick up there ass and thing their shit don&#039;t stink. Maybe they have been on here too long. Maybe they have been scammed too many times. Regardless it is no reason to act that way with your customers. You should be showing nothing but professionalism with ALL of your customers.<br /><br />This is my first post, and I am glad it was here. This truly needs to be noticed by the administration and DPR before things get out of hand.<br /><br />Thanks OP!<br /><br />~Sudo

				its not a perfect world. especially when it comes to 50,000+ people conducting blatant illegal activity on the internet. shit may be screwy, but at least the opportunity for success is still there. its like asking why so many movies are shitty. be glad some people are still making good movies rather than bitch about how so many people are making shitty ones. its a blessing to have such a resource. of course its going to be full of shit heads and dirtbags. hop around the piles of shit and enjoy yourself while you can

				We try our best to keep in contact, but buyers need to understand that for the larger vendors it is rough to get everything done to just keep safe on their own end then have to answer questions and whatnot..... It is a lot to handle sometimes. We keep up, but I know why others don&#039;t. Also shipping within 4 days is good people. Sometimes we are waiting to get new shipping items or for LEO heat to die down in an area. Most delays are out of safety with the majority of larger vendors.

				Great responses! I thought that only a few would agree. The site has become a huge success, and while it&#039;s still the best of it&#039;s kind, with the sheer amount of orders, the bottom line for it all is money. I&#039;m not even going to try to guess the amount of money that changes hands every day, (esp with the site taking it&#039;s cut off of every transaction) but it&#039;s not just a few btc, that&#039;s for sure! Sadly, when large amounts of money are at stake, the focus and overall attention to buyers, esp the smaller buyers who just want a little kick for the weekend, get pushed to the wayside. <br /><br />My vice is rather rare on the site, and the vendors that do happen to carry it from time to time charge a fortune or want to sell in bulk at insane prices. With the extreme rise in the cost of BTC&#039;s, most don&#039;t or won&#039;t adjust (for some reason, they are too idiotic, or just plain assholes to allow it to be hedged so it will all balance out). I woudn&#039;t mind in the past with a great vendor who would actually respond in a timely manner, paying an extra btc or 2 for non hedged, but now that a btc is dam near worth 40 some usd EACH, wtf, I cant play games with that. <br /><br />As I have been spending time reading more and more of the postings, if we get enough on the issues that could use some fixing, maybe there is hope. Weather we start a list of top vendors to be trusted for a certain product, or vendors that offer the best service. (by service I don&#039;t just mean they send ya a sack with an extra .05 gram in it, but one that will respond to a message, not cop an attitude, and most of all be honest). There are some GREAT vendors out there, but they are far and few between, and with all the listings these days, it would be much easier if there was an easy way to look them up with their warez...<br /><br />Maybe an idea like the top 10 or 20 vendors be listed right on the main page after you log in. They would have to get voted on 5 points, like: 1. Product quality (rate 1-5) 2. Responds in a timely manner (1-5) 3. Shipping in reasonable time (1-5) 4. Problem resolution (1-5) and 5. OTHER (buyer can enter something of concern)<br /><br />The trick to getting it right is how to anonomize it so the vendors who thing their shit dont stink lash out and try their user black list BS.<br />The only way facilitate the change is to hit the vendors in the pocket. The big boys will most likely never change, as I&#039;ve heard rumors of pulling in 1000&#039;s of btc a day in orders. Even if 10% left, they wouldnt care. The newer/mid size vendors are where we need to support/guide the most, as there are way more of them the big boys. If anything, we NEED a fuck the FE only vendor...lol!<br />If your a new buyer, the options for getting started these days suck! <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to stray off topic, but when I first joined, I was in heaven here. BTC&#039;s were under 1.00, you could buy 10 oxy for 5 btc, shipped the next day and get&nbsp; a DCN with just about every vendor selling it. Today with BTC&#039;s at 40+, the game is a little more expensive, so there are so many greedy/fucked up vendors just taking money left and right, and laughing all the way to the bank!<br /><br />Let&#039;s keep it going, we can make it better, we just need voices!!!<br /><br /><br />We&#039;re all mostly in the same boat here, <br />

				Give me links of at least 10 vendors that peg their prices to the BTC. That is by far one of the dumbest ideas EVER in the current market. You are frustrated I&#039;m guessing over getting a refund and the vendor being one that hedges. If you don&#039;t get the SR fees back then bitch at SR staff. I felt that rule was broken anyway.

				Another thing that really grinds my gears ;)<br /><br />Vendor honesty.. There is no way in hell, unless they live across the street from a Blue Box or postal office, that the vendor could stealth package, apply postage/labels, and get it to a mailbox. I wouldn&#039;t mind if it took this reputable vendor a day or two to process the order, but sheer lying that it is in transit is just not cool :-\<br /><br />&quot; ordered: March 15, 2013, 4:45 am UTC<br />&nbsp;shipped: March 15, 2013, 4:49 am UTC &quot;

				I thought I posted this before, but I guess it didn&#039;t go through.<br /><br />I recently placed an order and within 4 minutes it was marked as &quot;in transit&quot;<br /><br />I find that highly doubtful, while it could be possible though... However with the time it takes to stealth package, print labels, and apply postage and then drop it in a box, I would HOPE that it takes longer than 4 minutes for my own safety.<br /><br />Now obviously this seller just quickly flipped it to &quot;in transit&quot; when the order was just being &quot;processed&quot;<br /><br />This is not the right way to conduct business and I wish vendors would stop doing thing, no matter how reputable they are.<br /><br />I feel that the more reputable the vendor is, the bigger their ego is and they think they are entitled to create their own rules and conduct less than par business.

				I had to FE as a new buyer 5 times in order to use the escrow system back in the day. I never got ripped off on an FE because I researched the vendors before I dealt with them. Reading rumor mill posts on your drug of choice is a good way to find legit vendors.

				+1 OPman I agree with a lot of what you said.<br /><br />I have been preaching don&#039;t Fe since I found the site. If enough people stop accepting FE vendors will stop requiring it. <br /><br />The feedback system is one of my peeves as well. An A+ vendor should get A+ billing and not have to share the rate as B vendors. Also, its easy to say that you can minimize you risk by researching the vendor. You really can&#039;t because everyone gets 5/5 down the line. Also, vendors should be allowed to post a response to negative feedback. All of this would help buyers make better decisions. <br /><br />Now, buyers have to take responsibility as well for their own security. You should read vendor reviews, be fair but honest with feedback, and release funds when product is received. New people, for the love of god don&#039;t FE and drop hundreds of dollars on your first order. Start small and work up (even in escrow). <br /><br />I think there are more good vendors than bad. Not every vendor that asks for FE is out to screw you. I think some are just fed up with the auto finalize delays when a buyer doesn&#039;t release funds on time. However, FE just isn&#039;t a good fix for this. But I do see how a 18 day hold could hurt especially smaller vendors. A domestic priority package should take no more than 4 days at the far outside. Maybe a system where the funds are released say 5 days from when the tracking showed the package was delivered or something along those lines. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get why vendors don&#039;t tell people when an item is shipped. You can&#039;t go by the in transit date because like people said vendors will mark it I&#039;m transit way ahead of time. I do get why some do that. Tor is slow and loging in to Sr can be a pain at times. So I don&#039;t want to beat up on vendors for that. I don&#039;t think they are trying to mislead there. But let people know when things ship so the buyer knows when to expect it. <br /><br />The flip side there is that people can&#039;t be doing weird stuff with their addresses that raise suspicion at the po.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this conversation keeps going. The last one kind of died out. <br /><br />Be safe and enjoy traveling the road.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				+1 for vendors letting buyers know when the item is in the mail (and possibly when to expect it). Good customer service goes a long way.<br />As far as letting an order auto-finalize.. that is just fucking wrong. How are you going to freeze someones money for a couple weeks after you got your drugs because you were too lazy to finalize?! I mean what the fuck? How hard is it to login and finalize once you&#039;ve received?

What is the point of the Vendor feedback system when buyers are pretty much threatened to give 5/5? It&#039;s completely useless when used like that! Luckily the smart buyers will do their research in the forums on the vendor before purchasing from them. One thing that bugs me too is the whole 50 posts for new users. I know this is to eliminate spam, but I recently purchased some cookies from Maggots and wanted to leave him a good review, but could not because I was lower than 50 posts at the time. If someone had a BAD experience with a vendor and had less than 50 posts they couldn&#039;t even warn future buyers in the vendor&#039;s review thread.&nbsp; :-\

				You could always just spam to 50 in one of the spam threads. But it is pretty tedious. Also I agree with the faults in the 5/5 system.<br /><br />If your product isn&#039;t worth the money I dont think they should be getting 5/5 ratings. That is just outright misleading. <br />
