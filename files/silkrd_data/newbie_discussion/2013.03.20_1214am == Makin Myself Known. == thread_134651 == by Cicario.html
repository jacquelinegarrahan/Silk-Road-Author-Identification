				What&#039;s Up, i&#039;ve Known About The The Deep Web Or Undernet For Years, From Doing Research, Which Sprouted From Loving the Idea Of Not Being Able to Be Traced Doing Anything. I Always Wanted to Get Involved in This World, But I Never Made The Time..Except For Today. Just Gotten Used To The Navigation and Found My Way Here, I Gotta Say..I Never Thought Such A Huge Grin Would Sweep Across My Face Readin All Of These Threads and Forums. Only Thought That Popped In My Head Was...Why Didn&#039;t I Look Into This World Sooner haha. I&#039;m Never Usin WWW Sites Again. Everything iCould Ever Want is At My Finger Tips Now. The Main Questions I Have Being New to This Whole Everything is How Do Bitcoins Work and How to Be Completely Sure i&#039;m Dealing With Someone That Isn&#039;t LE.

				Welcome to the road sir. Bitcoins are a rather simple process to understand, all it takes is a little experience to get it down pat. You buy bitcoins from various traders such as Bitfloor, Bitcopia, and many others on Silk Road itself as well, although it carries slightly more risk of being scammed.<br /><br />Basically you tell the trader how much you&#039;d like in BTC, they give you a quote in USD, and direct you to deposit the funds completely anonymously at their bank of choice be it Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc. Do not worry, you don&#039;t need to give any of your personal information, all you do is fill out a deposit slip with the business name and location, and the amount you&#039;re depositing. Then the coins will be in your account depending on many factors, but some of the better traders will have them there instantly.<br /><br />With the traders on Silk Road the process is slightly different. They give you a quote for the amount you request, and many are dealing with banks as well, but some use Moneypaks. With Moneypaks only use the most trustworthy of traders on the site, as you have to release the funds first and when they acquire them, they send the coins to your wallet.<br /><br />There has never been a case with LE posing as vendors in my experience. Do your research, find vendors with many transactions and high feedback (90%+) and you&#039;ll be good as gold as long as customs doesn&#039;t meddle in your affairs if you&#039;re ordering internationally that is.<br /><br />Make sure to research and thoroughly understand how to use PGP encryption. It seems overwhelming at first, but you&#039;ll laugh at the difficulties you had when you really get down on how to use it.<br /><br />Other than that, read around on the forums, educate yourself on safety and security and most of all..... NEVER FINALIZE EARLY!

				Thanks JMoney, Yeah&nbsp; I Learned What FE Meant a Couple Hours Ago I&#039;m Never Doing That. I Guess Up Next is To Read Up On The Clearnet and How to Encrypt. If You Have Any Links That&#039;d Be Extremely Helpful.
