				Greetings my friends,<br /><br />I understand that this is the newbie thread but I would rather make my first post count than spam to 50.<br /><br />I have been a long time member of SR.&nbsp; Up until now I have only been a customer.&nbsp; Having been around for a while I have always seen that there is a proper lack of L.&nbsp; I do see that the amount of L for sale has greatly increased but many of the vendors are international for US customers (Canada, Ireland, UK).&nbsp; It really is nice to see this because I recall the days when reliable vendors with good L would sell out in hours (3jane!).&nbsp; Since I have become a member of this wonderful marketplace I have always wanted to get some L and put it up for sale.&nbsp; If you have never tried it LSD is a beautiful beautiful thing.&nbsp; I have had truly transcendental experiences while experimenting with her majesty and I think that it is a shame some folks who would love to try it cannot easily procure it.&nbsp; So, I got some L to get rid of on here for you lovely folks!&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a shit load of it, that is for sure.&nbsp; This is more of a test run than anything.&nbsp; If everything goes well I plan to bring around a little more.<br /><br />Read the next post for information (gotta get to 50 some how).

				I have procured 10 sheets of fluff (told you I didn&#039;t have a lot).&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to throw any other name on it like family or any of that nonsense because I really can&#039;t confirm anything like that.<br /><br />I have yet to try this stuff.&nbsp; I simply don&#039;t have time right now.&nbsp; I did get a few sheets of fluff from this guy last fall.&nbsp; It was very good and I would consider it some of the better stuff that I have tried over the course of about 10 years.&nbsp; It easily rivaled the good stuff that was coming out of CZ, fuck the feds.<br /><br />One blotter dropped tested in NIK D Ehrlich&#039;s Reagent resulted in a very strong positive purple result.&nbsp; The single blotter was fully saturated with purple color and that color looked evenly distributed.<br /><br />Prices you ask?

				Promotion?&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I am going to be running a promotion when I first open up.&nbsp; I currently plan to be giving away the excess trimmings as a show of good faith.&nbsp; Giving away... that means they will be free!&nbsp; I&#039;m not exactly sure how much trim I will have as I have yet to fuck with it.&nbsp; I would like to send the promotional stuff to users with decent purchasing history for a better chance of a mention on the forum, but I understand that there is inherent risk when taking free samples from a new vendor and I may not adhere to a purchasing history policy for the samples.<br /><br />I have also got excess silver trim and like 10 hits of silver in a vial.&nbsp; I will probably be giving that away as well because it is not very good and I don&#039;t enjoy fucking with it.&nbsp; It is okay.&nbsp; Nothing special.

				When the hell is the shop going to open!?<br /><br />I would say the vendor account will be up in about 2 weeks.&nbsp; It will be slightly less than two weeks if BTC price rises decently.&nbsp; That will allow me to have a lower out of pocket investment as far as vendor fees are concerned.<br /><br />During this time period I am going to be completely revamping my methods of security.&nbsp; I have always taken security seriously as a customer but as a start up vendor now is not the time to leave any rocks unturned in regards to security.&nbsp; Revamping security will allow for a safer experience for the customer and myself as a vendor.&nbsp; Sales will not begin until I am confident in my methods even if the vendor account is up.<br /><br />I will also be spending this time evaluating my packaging and stealth methods.

				Of course terms of use for the shop will exist.<br /><br />I have yet to determine what the terms of use for the shop will be.&nbsp; I do not want to do anything other than full escrow for all customers.&nbsp; So I will probably only be doing domestic (US) transactions for the time being.&nbsp; I will also be implementing some sort of purchase history limitations but I haven&#039;t decided what the restrictions will be yet.<br /><br />I look forward to providing you guys with some good L!&nbsp; :D

				With the rarity, high degree of chemistry credentials, and law enforcement cracking down harder than I ever on LSD, I welcome you to the community with open arms buddy. LSD is a magical substance and I feel like it can touch many more lives with an increase in vendors.

				@FluffNStuff normally you gotta get your vendor account going before they take on new lucy. However I would recommend sending those samples to some of the more credible members that are active in the Avengers thread. They will have more pull than most and they&#039;d be happy to help get you going.

				I have a feeling you will do well here. You won&#039;t be one of the greats (while you are limiting supply), but you will be one of those solid vendors that hang in the background - the people that aren&#039;t necessarily driven by a heavy greed but are the ones that are the foundation of the road; the real vendors behind SR that don&#039;t get credit for it. People like, well, 3jane, but also brutusk, rocker (hope she&#039;s doing well) and christynugs, off the top of my head. If you keep your op small (I think it&#039;s awesome you&#039;re limiting to 250 hits per week, that means maximum 50 packages i.e. 7 per day), and don&#039;t get insanely greedy, you will do very well here. You may not get thanked for your contribution every time you walk in the room, but you&#039;ll be well-respected, and there will be a tacit understanding that you are among the vendors that make the silkroad strong.<br /><br />Treat your customers well, keep your prices fair, and leave no stone unturned when it comes to safety (after all, this is what, at the end of the day, determines your freedom to stay on the outside). Get that (99) or (100) mark and watch the orders roll in.
