				Has anyone had any trouble with this guy? It&#039;s hard to search for him here because of his name, but I have a buddy who tried him (and FEd, he didn&#039;t consult me) and never received a package. He then pasted some DCN info saying it was delivered on a day that I know my buddy was watching the mail box. <br /><br />I wonder how many people get selectively scammed in their first transaction and just never come back to report it. <br /><br />Anyway... I thought this would be the place to ask/put it out there. I would wait til you can stay in escrow with this guy.

				TL;DR - The seller Vicodin did not ship and did not provide tracking to prove that the items were actually shipped.&nbsp; I FE&#039;d and he lied about shipping dates and the expectations that he set with me prior to our dealings.&nbsp; I am out a couple bills and I received no compensation.&nbsp; I have reported the seller Vicodin on SR and please do not FE with this guy he will steal from new buyers. <br /><br />------------ &gt;:(<br /><br />I&#039;m the buddy that was &quot;selectively &quot; scammed by the vendor Vicodin.&nbsp; His requirements for new buyers is that you must FE prior to him shipping the package to avoid being scammed.&nbsp; I communicated with him prior to the purchase and based off of the feedback I found in Rumor Mill I felt confident enough to FE with him.&nbsp; I never received the package and he never provided tracking information to prove that he actually did send the items.&nbsp; Do not FE early and always use Escrow.&nbsp; I am new to the board/community and I was scammed by someone with a fairly decent reputation.&nbsp; The seller Vicodin has no offered me any type of compensation and I have reported him officially through SR.&nbsp; Do not buy from Vicodin he is a fraud.&nbsp; If you always buy from Vicodin you should stop.&nbsp; He scams first time buyers and this is the most recent feedback you will find about the Seller Vicodin.&nbsp; All of the positive feedback in the rumor mill about Vicodin is from a year to 2 years ago.&nbsp; He scams and he is dishonest and he refused to prove that actually did hold up his side of the deal.&nbsp; VICODIN is dishonest and does not have his customers best interest at heart.&nbsp; I realize that I should have not FE and I do not expect much to come from this and this is simply a warning call to new members.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:D
