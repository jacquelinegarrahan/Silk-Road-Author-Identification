				Yes I love the edibles!&nbsp; I&#039;d check out the vendor QualityKings and his Cheeba Chews.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ordered from him a few times and his shipping speed, stealth/packaging and prices are all the tops.&nbsp; He charges about $33 for 2 chews which is $16.50 a piece and the best price on SR.&nbsp; These chews won the 2011 cannabis cup award for best edibles.&nbsp; They are potent!&nbsp; They come in quad dosage and deca dosage (4 dose and 10 dose respectively).&nbsp; They are very small about an inch and a half long by about half in wide and half inch tall but they pack a serious punch.&nbsp; Seriously if you have no tolerance for marijuana I&#039;d suggest starting with just 1/4 of a quad dose chew.&nbsp; If you have a tolerance start with 1/2 of a quad dose chew or 1/10 of a deca dose chew.&nbsp; Of course you can&#039;t OD on marijuana so eat as much as you&#039;d like.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve heard stories of all day everyday smokers puking and just getting messed up in general off of a full deca dose chew.<br /><br />Oh and I almost left out one of the best parts.&nbsp; With the quad dose you can pick from Sativa, Indica or Hybrid.&nbsp; So unlike other edibles where what you see is what you get, with these you can pick the type of high you want (and I can vouch that the Sativa chew is def. a mind high and a bit of a &quot;rush&quot; and the Indica chew is def. a body high which will make you sluggish and relaxed with the Hybrid meeting in the middle)&nbsp;

				For Edibles I&#039;d say that for edibles, BTCmoney is the best. He&#039;s great about doing custom orders if you want a variety of stuff.<br /><br />Edibles are great, but if you have a high tolerance, you might not notice much effect. Sometimes they just make me tired. On the other hand, a friend of mine with a really low tolerance took half a quad-dose cheeba chew and nearly had a break down.<br /><br />The main benefit is that it lasts a long time and the high comes on a little more gradually than smoking.<br /><br />Definitely give it a try. There are some very good products out there.

				There&#039;s a vendor selling these butterscotch suckers. I&#039;ve wanted to try those as my first edibles, and they&#039;re very reasonably priced. 0.04 or somewhere around there.
