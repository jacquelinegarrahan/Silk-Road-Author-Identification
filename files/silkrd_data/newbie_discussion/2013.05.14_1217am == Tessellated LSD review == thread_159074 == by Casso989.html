				Posting first time here, wanted to share my experience with Tessellated&#039;s amazing LSD.<br />&nbsp;Ordered on a Saturday, was marked in transit on Monday, recieved to West Coast US the next saturday.&nbsp; Stealth was FANTASTIC.<br />First time me and my wife took one tab each. Tabs tasted of straight up paper. came up rather rapidly as i walked our dog in a nearby park. Was feeling full effects within and hour and a half. Watched &quot;Ted&quot; for the first time and laughed my ass off. Very strong body and mind high at this dose, visuals not super strong.&nbsp; <br />The second time i took 1 1/2 tabs and was completely blown away, i have never tripped that hard on acid before. Was pretty for sure 300+ ug. I loved it.&nbsp; Visuals were intense intricate and beautiful, I would highly reccomend it. tripped for almost 8 hours straight.<br />

				I totally agree.&nbsp; Ive taken 1 tab twice with no tolerance and 2 once with about 2 weeks off.&nbsp; A single hit definitely got me going with a very heady high, but not strong visuals except for the hour or so around my peak.&nbsp; 2 doses definitely had the desired effect though&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; blew my mind.<br /><br />I&#039;d also say it lasted much longer than 8 hours for me, even on only 1.&nbsp; I&#039;d say closer to 12 on one tab, pushing 14-16 on 2 before I xanaxed myself to sleep haha<br /><br />Tess definitely has some quality stuff, and coming from Canada is nice to my location, but its a tad overpriced in my opinion, or for 10+ at least.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting on some liquid in the mail from JOR and I&#039;m really excited to review that&nbsp; 8)

We gotta look out for each other.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Was also on &lt;0.1g of MDMA taken about 7 hours in, so I&#039;d say that stimulant was the reason for being awake so long rather than lady Lucy.&nbsp; Definitely was experiencing strong after effects at at least 12-14 hrs though.&nbsp; Xanax just helps the thoughts slow down after a trip.&nbsp; Better nights sleep = Better recovery.&nbsp; Not that there was ANY hangover from Tess&#039; blotter.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, what caused the worry exactly?

				It just concerns me when I see people reporting timelines that increase with dosage. Usually makes me think its something other then LSD. It can be very difficult to tell the difference between certain RC&#039;s and LSD even for someone with quite a bit of experience. I&#039;ve known long time dead heads swear up and down things were &#039;pure&#039;, but not always the case. <br /><br />You were taking multiple things though which wasn&#039;t mentioned, that certainly changes things. The biggest concern is if its something like DoC instead of LSD is just simply if someone decides to go for a heroic dose.

				Yup, its the real deal:&nbsp; Multiple tests conducted in the forums place it in the range of 180 - 280ug, and in my case I&#039;ve given a ton of it out; universally its regarded as the best anyone has had.&nbsp; My trips usually end around the 6 hour mark, and with two Advil PM&#039;s I&#039;m out like a light.&nbsp; Lovely, lovely material :)<br /><br />Absolutely thrilled that he became a Star vendor today --completely, totally thrilled.&nbsp; About fucking time, I say.
