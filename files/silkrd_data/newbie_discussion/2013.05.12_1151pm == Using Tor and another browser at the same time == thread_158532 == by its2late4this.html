				I was reading this thread in the SECURITY topic -http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158430.0<br /><br />and was a bit concerned by what was said there, unfortunately, as a newbie, I couldn&#039;t reply on that thread, so I thought I&#039;d add my 2 cents here for all my fellow Newbs ;)<br /><br />Now, as long as you&#039;ve got effective security on your standard browsing (by that I mean no spyware that is capturing everything on your screen, or logging your keystrokes etc -&nbsp; and sending it to a third party) then yes, it&#039;&#039;s theoretically safe enough. <br /><br />My worry however is that people are trying to remain inconspicuous by highlighting the fact that they are doing &quot;the wrong thing&quot; with a massive neon sign!<br /><br />I work for a telecommunications company in Australia - and yes, your ISP can track what sites you&#039;ve been to and when.&nbsp; they can also tell when you&#039;ve been using Tor/darknet. (even if they couldn&#039;t find your entry point to the system - they&#039;d know simply by the fact that they can no longer view your activities by you&#039;re still racking up the MB&#039;s)<br /><br />So the idea that by using Tor to ONLY look at SR, and your standard browser for everything else, just shouts - &quot;HEY - I&#039;M BEING SNEAKY!&quot;&nbsp; not to difficult to work out you usually get a package delivered a few days after &quot;going dark&quot; if they are looking for a pattern.<br /><br />So - as stated by the TOR guys on their site - https://www.torproject.org/ - the best way to be inconspicuous is to blend in.&nbsp; highlighting your use of Tor is the opposite of blending.&nbsp; Use Tor whenever you can. so basically - if your not watching YouTube or other streaming media, gaming or transferring Torrents.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anything else you do online - use Tor.&nbsp; Even better, get your friends, family and neighbors using it as well.&nbsp; most people will give it a go, just because it &quot;feels naughty.&quot;&nbsp; Hell get a friend to give a lecture about it at the community college! Numbers is the only way to actually stay hidden.&nbsp; <br /><br />An analogy i heard from a computer analyst at work, that got the point across for me was this;<br /><br />Turning off your bedroom light to hide in the dark, only makes you easier to find if all the other lights in the house stay on.<br /><br />-<br />Another point of not making it easy for them to find you - especially if you occasionally have to sign for your stuff (which in Aus is most of the time!) Don&#039;t make SR the only place you order stuff from!&nbsp; If you are expecting something legit to be coming in the post - then why the hell wouldn&#039;t you sign for the package that rocked up at your door?&nbsp; <br />I personally love Ebay (international vendors of course)&nbsp; and sites like www.dhgate.com for random packages most of which get used come Christmas!<br /><br /><br />Anyway, sorry if that all sounded a little rant like, but I&#039;ve seen people get caught by the techs at work before - simply by trying to hard to &quot;hide&quot;<br /><br />Please, holler back if you&#039;ve got another opinion, preferably with useful advice to back it up - we&#039;re here to help each other right? ;)

				The ISP has no connection to the post. The only people that would monitor ISP and your post are the LE and if they&#039;re doing it, by that point you&#039;re already pretty fucked.

				@H3rm3s<br />Yes, thank you for that.&nbsp; the two points were intended as separate issues.&nbsp; They are both important however and all part of the security issue.&nbsp; thanks for your advice.&nbsp; ???

				Hey thanks for that. It&#039;s good to know. I had thought it was safer to close other browsers before using TOR. What you&#039;ve said makes a lot of sense.

				So is it ok to browse clearnet sites thro TOR as long as you aren&#039;t logging into sites that can be related to your self such as your email/facebook/other forums you are a regular on etcetc.<br /><br />Is it ok to use TOR to just google, browse ebay (not signed in), youtube (not signed in)?<br /><br />

				Nothing to worry about really, I don&#039;t think modern internet users have &quot;dark spots&quot; where nothing is happening as far as tracking goes but bandwidth is going up. This household I&#039;m in piles through massive amounts of bandwidth a month and there&#039;s others constantly on the internet at the same time, even if I am here browsing silk road. Like someone said, if they&#039;re monitoring both your post and internet, you&#039;re already pretty fudged. Oh and also, tor isn&#039;t illegal, you could be doing anything behind it, you could be ordering genuine parcels but just ordering through tor for extra security.

				If you&#039;ve set up Tor and are using fairly standard browser extensions then you&#039;ll be anonymous enough. Tor only effects the transparent (to you and the application) layer beneath what you care about. The browser only matters for certain things (you can be identified by the width of your browser window (if your browser leaks this information) and a load of other things - your user agent string, which fonts you can render, etc.<br /><br />But most sites rely on standard cookies and it would be very hard to associate a *new* browser with yourself. One with no cookies or addons and such.
