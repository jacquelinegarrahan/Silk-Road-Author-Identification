				Even better than getting baked and posting on the SR forums.

				Dude, it&#039;s like, zero gravity, man. ::giggles:: We&#039;re like, way far out there.<br /><br />Seriously though, getting baked in zero-g would be amazing I&#039;m sure...

				Vaping would probably be the way to go, as fliicking a Bic in a pressurized environment with lots of oxygen tanks and stuff around probably wouldn&#039;t be a great idea...<br /><br />On second thought, I&#039;d just take a strong-ass brownie with me...

				&quot;Space. Gotta go to space. Space. Space... wait... where was I?&quot;<br /><br />For some reason the idea of space-edibles comes to mind. Freeze-dried brownies in little mylar packages... All in all probably less a worry than vaping too. (on a side note, did anyone else get a massive laugh out of the geologist in Prometheus getting high by smoking inside his suit-helmet?)<br /><br />Related note: In zero-g, fire burns in a sphere, and even when the fuel&#039;s consumed, I believe there&#039;s still a little sphere of incandescent gas glowing away (since heat doesn&#039;t conduct well in microgravity, and even less so in vacuum--although radiative heat still works, as evidenced by the giant flaming sphere that rotates into view every day...)
