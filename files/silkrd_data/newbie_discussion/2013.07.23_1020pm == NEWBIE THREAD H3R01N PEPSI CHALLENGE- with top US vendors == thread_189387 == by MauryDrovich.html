				So this is a new account, but I have been purchasing through some friends&#039; accounts for a while now, and thought I would try to get some actual posts of content up instead of wasting all kinds of time just spamming my way to 50 posts. Hopefully some of you find that respectable and appreciate it. <br /><br />Besides, I have been puttin in some good work (and a lot of USPS dollaz) sampling all the top vendors to get a real pepsi challenge going,, so why not take the opportunity to share some of this current knowledge, as batches are always changing and its almost pointless to sift through 1300 pages of the main H vendor thread. <br /><br />First things first, anybody else find it hilarious that vendors ask for honest reviews about their product, and then further down on the same fucking page say something like, &quot;if you post a bad review I will blacklist you and you will never be able to get anything from anybody again..&quot; <br /><br />So yeah, hopefully we can sneak some real honesty into this thread without fear of retaliation from salty vendors trying to pass off shitty batches and still keep their reputation up. Not sure, but does the expression &quot;can&#039;t have your cake and eat it too&quot; apply here? Like, You can make that money selling your shit batch, or you can suck it up and be honest, and keep your solid feedback and people&#039;s trust that your shit is always gonna be fire, but you can&#039;t sling off a shit-batch, knowing full well its a shit-batch, and then be shocked and upset that your review page is slipping. Agreed? <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve been fucking with, speaking only for recent enough orders that still probably have relevance, I&#039;ve had in roughly this order, Fiv3starr stamps at the end of june, marl0 bulk order around 4th of July, which lasted until the week before last, then F1v3star bulk (gram) listing last week, then this week, got g0ts1t4ll,&nbsp; and subs&#039; &quot;makeup batch.&quot; and I am waiting on fr33w4y. Hoping to get dragon cove and another marlo batch after this just to refresh my memory on marl0 and see if his shit is consistant, I&#039;m kind of thinking DC might be the best from what I&#039;ve been reading, anybody with experience on DC vs other top vendors let me know, I&#039;d love to hear.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and I am stickin numbers in the names so that I don&#039;t incur the wrath of any&nbsp; vendor who decides to &quot;google&quot; themselves on the forums, and gets salty upon finding my honest review of their shit. I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t be too hard for them to figure out who I am on SR based on the info given in this post, so if any of yall are reading this, I hope you know its nothing personal and I&#039;m just sticking my neck out for the sake of other buyers on here looking to get some real input as to how everybody&#039;s gear stacks up against each others.<br /><br />So, here goes, F1v3st4r is fucking awesome as a vendor, super fast, very pleasant to deal with, responds quickly and doesn&#039;t make you feel bad for asking her questions and shit, but I just blew through her stuff so fast, there was like a ceiling with her gear, after about 80 mg I feel like I could do 500 more and not feel anything else. But, I placed my order before 2pm like she said, and sure as shit there it was in my mailbox the very next day, and it is still good stuff, but this gear from g0t51t4ll and 5ub5rg00d blow it out of the water. I think this batch from 5ub5 is pretty fucking righteous actually. It&#039;s a little soft, but I haven&#039;t had anything make me almost puke in a long time, and today I almost puked, so there&#039;s that. So basically, from best to not so best, as of now, I have <br /><br />1. 5ub5r600d &quot;makeup batch&quot;<br />2. G0t51t4LL&#039;s solid rocks and Marl0&#039;s are prettymuch tied I would have to have them both side by side and even then would be hard to pick a winner<br />3. F1v3st4r, and I feel really bad about this cuz I want her shit to be the best, I would love nothing more than to only have to deal with her, but I just plowed through that gram so I really would probably not go back unless she acknowledged that this recent batch was not super strong, and promised a stronger batch in the future. If you tell me your shit is uncut and top notch, and I am railing 100mg at a time just to get a little buzz, I&#039;m going to assume that&#039;s the best you have and see no point in ordering until you get a new source. <br /><br />So what sucks about all this, is I will probably lose sleep tonight wondering if I pissed off one of these vendors, but hopefully some of you who are trying to figure out where to spend your precious dough will find this useful. I am going to update as soon as I get fr33w4y&#039;s pack, and then hopefully DC and Marl0 will be next if I can get some coinage. <br /><br />I really hope some folks decide to chime in here, looking forward to hearing what you think! Also, this is my first real post on any forum site of any kind, ever, in my life, so if I&#039;m failing in terms of etiquette or anything else, please kindly let me know. <br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Maury D <br /><br />(I edited this to take out some pointless fluff words I over-used, like, I realized almost every paragraph started with &quot;So yeah...&quot; So yeah, I edited it.)

				I guess no one is going to read this as its been buried beneath a shitload of spam posts marked 1-50. Is that seriously the best way to get to 50, pretty sure you could just do it all on one thread instead of junking up the newbie forum. what a douche.

				The nearest person on localbitcoins is a 3 hour drive away. I&#039;ll probably get some more next time I get into town but that will be a quite few days from now. A walgreens is only an hour away. How do i use vanilla reload to buy bitcoin? Is there a way to do it online? I don&#039;t want to link my bank account or give all my info for okpay...

				Hey there Maury your post is fine this is a free market and no one is gonna get that bent out of shape if ya do not like a batch.<br />The funny thing is you went into detail on how it is not worth it to look in the main Heroin thread but i find that not to be the case at all.I know that it can be intimidating looking at a thread that is so big(1300)i think it is the largest thread on the forums atm but the people on that thread are a real community in my opinion and if you put the time in it can be a real help.<br />The other thing i noticed was that you were worried that being honest was going to get you in trouble but the way you explained your reviews and the conclusions that you came to are the EXACT same conclusions everyone on the Heroin thread have come to as well.I mean it is pretty much right on with vendors you ordered from and where they rank. You ranked em in the same order most people in the main thread rank em.<br />The last thing is that you said Vendor&#039;s ask for honest review then say later they will Ban you if you say something bad in the review.I think(not sure)that you are mistaking feedback for review&#039;s.Most vendor&#039;s do not mind if you do not think their batch is the greatest as everyone has different opinions on certain kinds of Gear however feedback is a totally different matter as bad feedback can really fuck a vendor&#039;s stats and therefore take food out of their mouth so to speak.Most Buyers/Vendors agree if the vendor ships you product out in a timely fashion and it is not bunk gear a 5/5 is warranted and you should not leave less than a 5/5 unless your pack does not arrives or it arrives but the gear is worthless.Most vendors will say that if you have a problem and do NOT contact them first before leaving anything but a 5/5 you will be blacklisted and that is a common practice and the #1 reason buyers end up on vendor blacklists.That is how i percieved your post anyway sorry if i am wrong<br />Sorry for the long winded post but the bottom line is that your post was fine and i hope to see you and many other Heroin users in the main thread once ya reach 50 posts and i hope people are not intimitated to post there as it really is a cool place to chat! Sent ya some karma as well!

				I&#039;ve ordered recently from UGS, Hatt3r, Marl0, &amp; sup3rsun.e<br />Full disclosure: Ive got a pretty gnarly tolerance and i take 40mg of don3s a day along with other opiates.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard UGS sh1t is &quot;synthetic&quot; ie:fent and milk powder.&nbsp; The high potency and lack of legs seem to confirm this, though the price is reasonable for what you get out of it (even though buying fent citrate or having SunWu&#039;s &quot;synthetic dope&quot; shipped from the UK-not sure why he doesnt offer it from his domestic supply).&nbsp; My only gripe with UGS is that I can NEVER seem to nail his shipping sched-he says he intentionally switches it up and takes weekends off, kind of seems like he only ships 3-4 days a week. so, on average it seems to take ugs a full 24hrs longer to get my orders out than other vendors recently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always enjoyed hatt3r&#039;s cold shoot although it&#039;s insanely expensive.&nbsp; I dont know enough about chemistry either, but I&#039;ve heard concerns that heroin can degrade when left in water? Like I said, I&#039;m too dumb to know if thats a real concern, but the idea of having a solution triple-micron filtered is very attractive.&nbsp; Plus hatt3r&#039;s shipping has always been amazing as he offers express.&nbsp; I have noticed though that as of this AM, hatt#r has seemed to have disappeared.<br /><br />Sup3rSun offers an adequate BTH for my needs and ships promptly with an option to pay extra for your tracking number with priority (though I never received the tracking info for my first order &amp; am expecting a package from SS any time now and have not heard back on requests to have free tracking on my 2nd order bc it never happened on the 1st).&nbsp; <br /><br />Marl0 is professional as fuck but I personally felt that his product was kind of over-hyped.&nbsp; First shot from the 2gs I had overnighted to me got me well and felt pretty nice, but I didnt feel like this stuff was the fire everyone says it is.&nbsp; Also had a strong vinegar smell, Ive experienced this with other raw-I used to cop raw by the g regularly when I lived in baltimore-but I&#039;ve heard that this is evidence of cut-again-i&#039;m not informed enough to know for sure.&nbsp; All I can say is that Marl0&#039;s service is legit, his product is in fact real heroin, though I wish it were stronger.<br /><br />So, in all I really have to say that for my money and my tolerance, UGS is going to be where I most likely spend the bulk of my opiate dollars-though I havent tried ALL of the &quot;top&quot; H vendors on SR.&nbsp; Wish we could get someone to come along with real fire at under $180 a G with an express shipping option.&nbsp;

				nice use of HMO, never heard that outside of my real life friends. update, I got a ball from marlo after a bunch of successful orders, he sent me some bunk ass re rocked garbage. I messaged him about it and basically told me to suck it, so fuck that guy. I can&#039;t wait for subs to get back, should be real soon. save your money. I have an order of that blue diamond on the way, I&#039;ve heard its as good as fivestars, which, for the price, I would take all day. hopefully its legit, i&#039;ll let ya&#039;ll know.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure marlo is still good with little orders, but when getting a big order, especially if he is at the end of the batch, be careful.

				so you got your batch from marlo and it was good? I have been doing huuuuuuge (150-200mg) rails of it and not feeling anything, thought my tolerance was just ungodly but my buddy got some from dragoncove and I did like 40mg of that and am feeling a little too high, might puke, so good news is It&#039;s not my tolerance, bad news is I still have over a gram of marlo&#039;s garbage 8ball he sent me. it was all rock too, but a lil different looking, and really smells like coke, like what you cut coke with. its weird, disappointing. it seems like your last batch you got from him was better, I&#039;m glad to hear.
