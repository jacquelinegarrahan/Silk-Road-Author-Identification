				i received mine today, 10 working days to west eu. i stayed in escrow, the product is white/clear rocks and overweight.&nbsp; i&#039;m very happy with the order and would definitely order again. i was starting to get worried because it took so long but oa came through in the end. it can take him a couple of days to respond to messages but i imagine this is because of everyone panicking about there orders taking a while to arrive and sending him messages about it.&nbsp; if your not in a rush then try oldamsterdam.<br />&nbsp;

				On 2nd order and still waiting.&nbsp; Ordered close to the end of december.&nbsp; Feel like it will show up soon as I see others getting theirs.&nbsp; It really seemed like a restocking issue.&nbsp; This happened with my first order, but he came through, so I have less fear about it.<br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t take an order I didn&#039;t have something on hand for, but apparently he can stay on top of it.&nbsp; (for the most part?)&nbsp; It seems like things are back to normal, so one can hope it says that way.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to judge someones character through some typed sentences, as opposed to meeting them, but he seems like a good guy that wants to do whats right.&nbsp; He has been on top of communication with me for sure.&nbsp; I certainly don&#039;t see him doing whatever SuperTrips is up to.&nbsp; <br />Hope it comes soon cause my 1st order was like.....crazy good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will update.

				I would really advise going to someone else first considering you&#039;re new and a refund will hurt your rating. I ordered from him over a month and a half ago and was communicating with him throughout the whole thing and never received my order. I hate to say that he belligerently ripped me off because he has been reassuring me that the package will arrive but for all I know that could just be the way he does things (passively ripping off newbies he convinces to FE by reassuring them the package will arrive).&nbsp; He does seem very genuine in messages but somethings suspect about him. There&#039;s no reason so many people shouldnt be receiving their packages, I mean if he was sending out all these packages and they were getting lost wouldn&#039;t he be afraid to lose money?. He offers no justification for whats going wrong either which is the biggest red flag. I FE&#039;d early upon request so there is nothing I can do to resolve it and when I asked if he would be willing to reship he didn&#039;t even acknowledge my proposal. If you go through his reviews, about 3 out of every 5 mentions an order not showing up or someone having to resolve an order. I honestly dont even understand how his review rates are still in the 90% with all his missing packages.

				Ordered 60g from OA..<br /><br />Took 60 days to arrive and only 50 of the 60 were in the package due to a packager error.<br /><br />Still working out a refund.. he likes to say things like yeah I&#039;ll refund you.. go on holiday for 4 or 5 days and say the same thing when he returns yeah I&#039;ll refund you... another 5 days.. repeat<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend starting with OA. His product is fire though I will say that.<br /><br />[UPDATE] I received my refund for the 10g that was missing from the order.

				Ordered off him, asked for 1 ounce and I&nbsp; FE&#039;d. He came thru, overweight by a very considerable amount. Product may have a possibility of making you puke. Not the strongest mdma ive had. CloudSurfer&#039;s was a more stronger and cleaner roll. <br /><br />HE NEEDS TO WORK ON THE PACKAGING THOUGH. I HOPE EVERYONE WILL SEE THIS MESSAGE THOUGH. OLDAMSTERDAM NEEDS HELP ON PACKAGING. Its considered a blessing that it made it through customs.

				He has very high quality gear, but his delivery time was awful.<br /><br />Took 30 days to UK for one of my friends which is quite the wait seeing as most EU orders get here in a couple of days.
