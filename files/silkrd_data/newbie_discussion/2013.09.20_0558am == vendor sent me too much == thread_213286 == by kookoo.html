				i recently placed an order for a substance that shall remain unidentified. i realise that some vendors will add a little extra, but this was clearly the next tier quantity available from the same vendor. <br /><br />i considered notifying the vendor, but i can only see this being either pointless or a problem for me if the vendor demands i send some coin or reacts in some other unreasonable manner. i just wanted to let them know, but dont want to put myself in a bad situation for nothing, even if there is only a very low chance of that happening. its a bit paranoid, but i try to approach this SR caper primarily minimizing risk. <br /><br />i feel a little guilty i guess. irl i would just send it back<br /><br />fwiw the total value of the product is low. &lt;$500.<br /><br />what do you think should be the appropriate response from both party&#039;s regarding a situation like this?

				Sounds like you lucked out. You can message the vendor notifying them, but then he may expect you to provide some sort of compensation. If he does, you don&#039;t really have to do anything, but there is the slight issue of that vendor having your address, assuming that you used your real address. Can you trust this vendor not to somehow out you in retaliation? It&#039;s unlikely, but it&#039;s something that can happen. The moral thing to do here is to provide notification, and that&#039;s all.&nbsp; Remember, it&#039;s the vendor&#039;s mistake, so you are not obligated to provide any kind of compensation as you never agreed to do so. If you were to provide the wrong address, for example, a vendor would not provide a refund on product already sent out. We are all responsible for our own mistakes. <br /><br />If you&#039;re feeling REALLY guilty about it, you two could arrange for it to sent back, but honestly for that amount it probably isn&#039;t worth bothering over.

				let the vendor know and offer to pay for it when you next have the coin - some of them do it to test buyers trust levels. most vendors will just swallow the loss, it&#039;ll only be an arsehole vendor that would make you pay for their mistake

				Tell the vendor! He may have mixed up orders, and some other unlucky soul may be trying to tell this vendor that they received too little.

				I&#039;d tell the vendor, it&#039;s common courtesy and they will appreciate your honesty+maybe give you preferential treatment in the future. More than likely they will just tell you to keep the extra and you&#039;ll feel better about it. If they ask you to pay extra, tell them that you don&#039;t have the $$ and that you didn&#039;t want that much anyway. Offer to return the extra - No vendor is gonna give out his address anyway!!!

				I can understand a certain amount of paranoia from someone new to SR but please don&#039;t allow fear to hold you back from doing the decent thing. My impression from reading the forums and feedback is that the overwhelming majority of vendors are reasonable people and that most would greatly appreciate your honesty. There are of course some bastards out there as in real life but would you want people thinking the worst of you because they knew that some buyers were shitheads?<br /><br />It may also be worth remembering that, AIUI, not keeping addresses is a cardinal rule of SR and any vendor discovered to be doing so will have their account closed down.
