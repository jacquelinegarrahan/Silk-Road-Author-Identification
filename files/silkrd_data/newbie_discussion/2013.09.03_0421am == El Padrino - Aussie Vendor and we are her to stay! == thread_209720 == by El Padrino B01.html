				G&#039;day All, <br /><br />**WELCOME**<br /><br />El Padrino. - &#039;the SR vendor trusted by all&#039; Est.15th June, 2013<br />With years of experience in merchandising - El Padrino offers a superior service with the highest quality product in demand for return of satisfied customers every time. Undefeated in all stealth methods with guarantee of delivery. We are an Australian based entity working together within the limitations of our world in order to deliver safely to your hands these items so difficult to acquire. We hope you enjoy our service and in return we hope that you take care and be responsible with the use of substances you have bought from us, and we look forward to seeing you again.<br />Here you will find a unique service, communications are kept professional and friendly on a personal level, because you are a person, not another profile! First and foremost you welcomed and treated with respect always, we are all people helping each other in this crazy corrupt world, I am well aware that you are a person with feelings and dignity and self respect that is on the other side of the Road, so please remember, that El Padrino is not just a &#039;website&#039; or &#039;profile&#039; to buy illicit substances, there are real people here and myself behind this &#039;profile&#039; working hard to make sure you receive a standard of service that is incomparable to others. Without any part of El Padrino gone overlooked we are confident that you will not find a better, friendlier vendor service provider on the Silk Road. Although all information and records is destroyed at the end of each day, there are a few customers that stay in my mind, these customers receive lot&#039;s of other extras like offers of new batches, special deals and arrangements, free samples, overweight deals, etc. El Padrino is here to stay, we may take short breaks now and then but wer are not like half these other Aussie vendors who build up to a good reputation and then do a dodgy act and disappear with everybody&#039;s money, we aim to provide a long and trusted service that Aussies know they can spend their money and get what they asked for, not a super hyped description for an item that is a total load of shit, not a stream of excuses after as to &#039;what happened?&#039; or neither am I going to make it difficult for you to get a refund or fix up an order if something is not right, we are &#039;honest traders in a dirty business&#039; and we are to stay,...see you around,<br /><br />with regards,<br /><br /><br />El Padrino<br /><br />&#039;WE ARE HONEST SELLERS IN A DIRTY BUSINESS!&#039;<br /><br />See you around...<br />
