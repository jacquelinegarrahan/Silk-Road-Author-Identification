				http://yro.slashdot.org/story/13/05/05/2329240/former-fbi-agent-all-digital-communications-stored-by-us-govt<br /><br />From the comments:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: girlintraining</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dear US official;<br /><br />All of my communications are sent via encrypted proxy, and set to stream constantly. The proxy dumps into Tor and a half-dozen other networks. I originally did this for shits and giggles, to see how hard it would be. I will admit the latency is a bit higher than doing it locally, but it is very usable in spite of this. I also signed up for the Tor Cloud project and run an EC2 micro-instance to help others do the same.<br /><br />Originally, I just did this as an experiment, but after reading things like what you&#039;re saying and realizing that we&#039;ve become a surveillance state on par with Iran, China, and North Korea (where did they get their filtering and monitoring hardware from again? Oh right: We gave it to them), I decided to keep it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do anything special with my super duper encrypted &quot;all the things&quot; setup. I wish I could say I was some elite ninja hacker or something, but all I really do is browse internet forum sites and read the BBC news, and you know, download a few TV shows here and there. I&#039;m one of those people that doesn&#039;t have anything to hide per-se, but when I live under the tyranny of a government that has turned their citizens into the enemy -- the attitude that we&#039;re all criminals or potential criminals, and must be monitored pre-emptively, I feel like it&#039;s my duty to frustrate the hell out of people like you.<br /><br />So I have been helping friends, family, and strangers, set their computers up the same way. Yeah, I know, some of them will probably use their newfound freedom and anonymity for evil, but frankly, even a terrorist attack a week and all the rantings in the world from you (that may even be justified) about how criminals can use this technology for their own nefarious purposes, doesn&#039;t deter me.<br /><br />You crossed a line; Morally, ethically, constitutionally. By criminalizing the average citizen, you have become a bigger danger than all the terrorists, all the &quot;real&quot; criminals. You are corrupt, dangerous, and seek to undermine our democratic way of life. You hide in the shadows and see conspiracies everywhere, and are convinced of your own righteous cause. You are as dangerous as a religious fundamentalist, because just like their dogmas, yours demands absolute purity. There will always be more justifications to invade the privacy of others.<br /><br />So I will continue to teach anyone who wants to, how to fight back against your tyranny. You&#039;re a threat to the way of life of not just myself, but my peers. You&#039;re a danger to all Americans -- you view us as the enemy. Your own people.<br /><br />You&#039;ve lost your way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				My son told me I was paranoid today when I told him I thought we should start encrypting all our communications and using secure browsing. Paranoia is becoming realism.

Purely a consequence of hybrid laws:<br /><br />1. Moore&#039;s Law<br />2. Murphy&#039;s Law<br /><br />The synthesis creates the following:<br /><br />*U.S. Law*<br /><br />Over 10,000 documents were created from the truck bombing against the US Embassy in Benghazi. Those were just bits and bytes of data... 10,000 documents, varying in length with the upper limit as long as the list of documents. <br /><br />Bureaucracy is a necessary curse for securing world order. Rome failed at securing its constituents, overrun by barbarians and religion. There are horrifying parallels between Rome and the current U.S. regime. Asia and Africa is still full of barbarians, ripping and scamming their way to the next generation. Now the Middle East is taking a serious crack at power--but they risk extinction, as the U.S.---and much of NATO--back Israel. Syria continues to destroy itself, denying U.S. presence yet pleading for U.S. funds.<br /><br />Even though Syrians will probably never see these words, I&#039;ll entertain the thoughts in my frontal lobes:<br /><br />Syria: You want U.S. help? What are you willing to lose for it? Foreign aid is a barter system, if you didn&#039;t know...<br />To Syrian people: You, too, are fighting for survival...<br /><br />Peace, love, and fuck haters, scammers, prosecutors, judges, MPAA, Monsanto, Root &amp; Brown, Boeing, private prisons, prison guards, wardens, and all you other hate-spewing mother fuckers.<br /><br />One Love.

				Good to be conscious of this... not sure it warrants much further thought however, realistically. Don&#039;t incriminate yourself and you shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about.

				In all honesty, yottabytes of cold storage is the greatest cultural artifact any human organization ever created. If you look at it in this light, then it is fucking genius.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t we have a complete record of Mayan computers? They were weathered, destroyed, or lost in translation--incomplete lingual artifact, such as the Rosetta Stone--an identical document written on stone in three ancient languages.<br /><br />If there is a permanent record of human activities, then it is the greatest resource since humans began writing.
