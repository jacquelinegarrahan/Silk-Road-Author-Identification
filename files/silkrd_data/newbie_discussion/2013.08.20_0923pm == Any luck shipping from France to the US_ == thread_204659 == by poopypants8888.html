				Hi all,<br /><br />I found decent prices from &#039;theocguy&#039; and he seems like a really legitmate vendor but living in the US I was curious if anyone has purchased from France with luck... It doesn&#039;t seem like LE or postal workers would scrutinize something from France like they would another EU country like the Netherlands... <br /><br />So, has anyone had any experiences? Thanks!

				The only thing from France I ever liked or wanted is their toast....... mmmmmmmm<br />With that said, I&#039;ve been curious bout those French sourced OC&#039;s myself . I&#039;d like to know how long the shipping takes . As long as the guy packages properly I wouldn&#039;t worry at all about customs. I&#039;ve got stuff from Belgium a few times and the UK once, no issues at all.

				Hey, thanks for the response!<br /><br />It seems like Belgium would be slightly more conspicous than France and if you say that was no problem, that makes me feel alot more comfortable...<br /><br />As far as shipping goes, he says around 7 days which seems like it would be legit. <br /><br />As far as the sourcing, it&#039;s straight oxycontin brand and sent in the original blister packaging so that makes me feel a hell of a lot better right there too...
