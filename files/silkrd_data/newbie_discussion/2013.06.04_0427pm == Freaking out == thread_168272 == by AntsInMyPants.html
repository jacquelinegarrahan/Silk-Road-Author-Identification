				I ordered 2gs of weed from uk and 7gs of shrooms from canada both in transit for 2 days now but that is not the problem. I just started researching where the packages are going to arive and it seems they re gonna come at my countries mail system where i have to pick them up and it s even a bigger deal because they re from overseav (me being from europe) and it seems like at our customs they re pretty strict with these far away orders from what i ve read. Can you guys help me out a bit calm me down and give me some advice?

				Well my 1st few orders I felt the same way and signed for them a few times.&nbsp; If you notice different mail people then it might be a controlled setup.<br /><br />1. Go into the post office and mail letters out and look at the emlpoyees, remember this when you pick them up, cars in the parking lot people sitting in cars etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also let them sit there for a few days to get them.&nbsp; Most law enforcement with delivery to your home and wait a fwe minutes and then they knock down or on your door.<br /><br />If you have to pick it up and sign, well go in and look around anyone making eye contact directly walk out...<br /><br />

Obviously these are things you should have considered prior to ordering, yet since the product is already en route, there isn&#039;t a lot that can be done until the product arrives....one way or another.<br /><br />Relax, you will be fine.

				Pick it up, and if something happens be like, What the hell? I didn&#039;t even know what was in this? You can play it off, Just don&#039;t sign for it&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Another good reply from someone which I&#039;m partly correcting is, If they wanna catch you they&#039;l come to your door, act like a mail man and retrieve your sig... after that BAM LE
