				I have been hearing stories lately about a device that police have called a microwave that detects weed. Has anyone ever heard of this?

				I&#039;ve seen the hand held Infra Red devices, these will detect a house with a lot of lights burning and no insulation.<br /><br />Helicoptors can sweep an area and spot grows when houses light up bright white. In some areas, I&#039;m sure half the town is shining. Some areas in the cities you can smell the growing bud, vented without filters! Or with failing filters!<br /><br />Drones, when licensed over the UK will be kiited out with infrared.<br /><br />Most busts are down to people you know, who tell someone, who tells someone else who tells the police informant phone lines, gives their informant number and gets money paid to a credit card when the info is correct.<br /><br />NEVER inform a new girlfriend of any grow! I&#039;m married so cannot hide anything!<br /><br />So, as for the microwave, I&#039;m not sure about that advance in technology. My main worry is a bored cop spotting green patches in Sept/Oct, but the liklihood is very slim and with a few plants per patch, planted far apart, blending in with nettles, I&#039;m not losing much sleep over it.<br /><br />Harvesting is basically, a wing and a prayer. Driving with a car full of plastic bags full of Englands finest, is always an adrenaline rush!<br /><br />Just hope we have enough sun!<br /><br />But we always get something, and you got to love free weed grown under the sun and watered by rain and fed by natural nutrients. (We do add flowering formulae as time goes on.)<br /><br /><br />Its a well known fact MANY men are busted by girlfriends who feel they are being treated unfairly.<br /><br />Basically tell nobody, vent hot air to your central heating duct and always make sure you have an inlet fan on 24/7 as with the outlet fan and filter.<br /><br />You have more to fear from gangs of grow robbers than the police in the UK, so stay out of the cities and head to the hills far from the lowlife.
