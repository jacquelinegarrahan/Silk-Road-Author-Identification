				So basically I live in bumfuck nowhere it&#039;s very rural to say the least. I was wondering if this gives me an advantage when receiving packages because they don&#039;t have the resources to go after me?&nbsp; I&#039;m just being super paranoid because I ordered three packages at once and I&#039;m just hoping they aren&#039;t holding any. I&#039;ve done it plenty of times before with nothing happening but I&#039;ve never done three packages within such a short span of time and I&#039;m tripping out because none are here and the earliest one was ordered Monday. My friend gets medical directly from California sent in just the pill bottles because who ships it is retarded and he hasn&#039;t been caught to put that into perspective.

				It&#039;s better to live in a big city with a high crime-rate than in a rural area.. Not to mention you&#039;re probably the only one using TOR in a pretty big radius. But if you&#039;re not buying huge quantities then I wouldn&#039;t worry about a raid, you&#039;d get a love letter first.

				your area will either be too stupid to even think there is drugs in your mail<br />or they will find out and make a big deal out of it and you&#039;ll be known as the guy who gets drugs in the mail<br /><br />or the best worst case scenario, the postman/LE finds out and skims your drugs off the top and gives you open packages

				I&#039;m sure I&#039;m just tripping since the earliest was Monday evening and I had to FE (TheTopShelf) so I don&#039;t even know if he actually sent it since he put in tranit so I could FE. The OZ auto finalizes in 14 days and the shrooms in 16 so it really hasn&#039;t been that long. They are pretty stupid here and I&#039;ve had about 8 packages make it just fine.

				Tor isn&#039;t just for druggies, hackers and pedos, it&#039;s for cypherpunks, security freaks and conspiracy nuts too. There&#039;s no way for anyone to tell what camp you fall into, whether you&#039;re actually using Tor or whether it&#039;s a virus on your computer connecting to a command and control centre.<br /><br />As a technical guy and e-privacy activist I have no problems whatsoever with admitting my Tor use, it&#039;s a tool that everyone should use. If you&#039;re paranoid that everyone&#039;s watching you then you should probably lay off the drugs for a while.

				Great quote, CHROOT- thanks!<br /><br />And OP, as quixotist says, there are many uses for tor, so you probably don&#039;t have to worry for using it... I don&#039;t believe that it would raise a red flag. Many technical guys use it in &#039;developed&#039; countries...

				Okay well the gram I ordered is now at my post office probably to be delivered on Monday as per the word of the vendor who tracked it. I hate having it just chill there any longer than it already is but guess I need to stop tripping. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s probably cool now that it has made it this far, and I can&#039;t see this post office doing anything knowing who runs it. Man, I haven&#039;t ordered in a while I forgot how shitty waiting feels and I&#039;m way more paranoid than usual lol.

				I&#039;m in the same boat, and I think users here have put it nicely.&nbsp; Here are my thoughts; a seasoned member may correct me if my assumptions are wrong (please do)<br /><br />1) LE actually has more time on their hands.&nbsp; In fact, if it&#039;s like my area, it is NOT uncommon to see about 2-4 police cars for a simple traffic violation/accident.&nbsp; In a neighboring big city, this is almost unheard of.&nbsp; They are more likely to want to bust someone in the area because it will set an example.&nbsp; In big cities, busting someone for some weed is basically clutching straws.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)Regarding TOR: while I think its suspect as it has a maligned reputation, I don&#039;t think running it is any just cause.&nbsp; If that were the case, we&#039;d all have torrents automatically cause for intrustion/ISP alert, which only happens if copywrighted material is found ORIGINATING from your network.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) I don&#039;t know how much pot you guys smoke, but given the speediness of some of these vendors, why chance ordering more than say, a 1/2 oz (or a 1/4) at a time?&nbsp; Again, referring to #1, we have GREATER restrictions because LE has nothing else to do.&nbsp; You can always get a 2nd order with less weight a day or so after.<br /><br />4) Be there for your package/never sign.

				Well lets hope these &quot;good old boys&quot; don&#039;t ever catch wind. This is all good to know though. I have no reason to believe my packages aren&#039;t going to get here. I&#039;m mostly just being paranoid since 8+ have made it just fine.

				As a criminal defense attorney in a small rural area, I would be far more comfortable sending/receiving &quot;packages&quot; in a big city. The police/postmasters in small rural American towns have little to do. I would think you&#039;d be far safer in a huge metropolis where your package would be one amongst thousands.

				So I got my OZ today but not the gram that TheTopShelf said was at the post office on Saturday. So either he lied about where it was, or something weird is going on. The OZ was delivered without a problem and it&#039;s been hours since it got here, so no CD. I don&#039;t know what the fuck to think now.
