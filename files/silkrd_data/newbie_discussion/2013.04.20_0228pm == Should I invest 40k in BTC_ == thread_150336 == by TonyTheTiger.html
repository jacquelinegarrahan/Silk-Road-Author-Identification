				There is something called securities commissions who oversee all investment products in the country. <br />Almost every investment is secured except bit coins.

				No, I wouldn&#039;t go all in on BTC.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to diversify your investments because there&#039;s the possibility that bitcoin could disappear.&nbsp; We don&#039;t know what people are doing behind the curtains.&nbsp; The media can have an acute impact on perception of bitcoin&#039;s value and the government could try to make bitcoin illegal.<br />That said, I think the value of bitcoin will continue to rise in the long term.&nbsp; In my opinion there will always be a core community, the so-called die hards who have too much invested to see it fail.&nbsp; These are the people who will not try to sell in moments of panic, and thus BTC will retain their value.&nbsp; Right now happens to be a good time to buy because of the recent crash which weeded out some of the weaker investors who do not truly understand the objective value of BTC.

				Is your income upwards of $200k/yr and you are young? Then sure, you can afford to be that risky. Otherwise, I would diversify that money among high and low risk investments, including BTC. Things like ETFs, high-yield bonds, index funds, etc. With that much money to invest, it is worth it to seek the advice of MULTIPLE financial advisers, as well as to read up on basic investing yourself to make sure you aren&#039;t being fooled by anyone.

				Do it as soon as you can. Bitcoins are a guaranteed return in the long run because there is a limited supply. The only thing you&#039;re betting against is legislation or the rise of another crypto-currency. Just make sure you have a target price to cash out at so you&#039;re not perpetually exposing yourself to risk. you can even ladder this at 150% return, 175% return, 200% return, etc. It is a money market so the rate is always fluctuating.

				Hmmm. If I had 40k to invest, I&#039;d invest 5k, maybe 10k.<br /><br />There WILL be new, competing crypto-currencies in the future. Crypto is here to stay. But wilth BTC at the moment, there are too many variables to consider. And yes, the governments may try and shut it down. They might not be able to stop the BTC itself, at least not easily, but they could easily stop exchanges from trading in BTC. If that were to happen, BTC would still float around the net, and peers would still trade it among themselves underground, but it won&#039;t be so easy to convert it to cash, except on the black market.<br /><br />And who knows how the value is going to appreciate or depreciate long-term? There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence which suggests that its rarity will increase the value. But its rarity may also open the way for newer, competing currencies.....

				Yeah don&#039;t invest all of that. Your portfolio needs diversity. I&#039;d say invest 1k-5k max in bitcoins and wait and see what happens. You&#039;ll also need to buy them anyways if you wanna buy things here on. So having a large chunk of coins to transfer whenever you need the is useful too.

				What I would do is maybe take 10k. Then set a low buy rate, say $60-80. If the price drops suddenly you can buy low automatically. Then set a higher sell rate, say $180-$200. That way if there are overnight high fluctuations you&#039;ll be ready to roll. But do set a sell target and stick to it, don&#039;t be too greedy or you could lose it all.

				If I had that kind of money to invest I agree I would diversify my investments. I probably would invest in BTC but it would not be more then 25% of my investment and I agree I would wait for another bubble to hit and buy low. I think they will increase their value over the long haul provided the government doesn&#039;t step in. I know someone hoarding 900 coins as an investment but I am sure they wish they would have sold @ $250 now. I doubled my money on investing in them but it was not a large sum I bought @ $74 and sold @ $140 so I did ok. I am waiting for another bubble myself before reinvesting again.

				I have a couple grand I could invest in bitcoins, but it&#039;s definitely smarter to start small.<br /><br />I just think what my life would be like if I suddenly lost all this money that I was given. I live a comfortable life, thanks to that, and I like to be safe with that money.<br /><br />I&#039;d say invest 1,000 tops. And then put 5,000 in a Roth IRA account. Trust me. That&#039;s the safest, most trusted way to grow your money. And you will need it in the future.

But it is still growing and even if it does crash again it will also probably recover again.<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t want to bet $1,000 on that let alone 40k. lol

				I&#039;ve been investing in Bitcoin since it was at $5.<br /><br />Dropped about $20k last year, picking up a bunch around $8. Since then I have added to the stash at prices from $10-$130. Now I have 5k+ BTC.<br /><br />When it reaches $1k/coin, I&#039;ll sell a small percentage, keeping the rest, spending only as needed.<br /><br />My advice would be to buy no more than you can afford to lose. <br /><br />Having said that, this is the opportunity of our lifetimes.
