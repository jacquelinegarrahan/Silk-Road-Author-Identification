				Installed Tor on my Samsung Note 2 but when the log in window comes up for SR I can put in username and passphrase but the letters/numbers of the verification don&#039;t show up. Is this a screen resolution problem and does anyone know a way around this as I want SR on my phone so I can keep an eye out and order while I&#039;m out n about 8)

				Unless you&#039;re very technically savvy and are using a disposable burner, I would avoid accessing SR via a phone for security reasons. You would be much safer using an encrypted bootable USB or an inclusive portable OS designed for anonymity and security, such as TAILS or Liberte Linux.<br /><br />It is a Very Bad Idea (caps necessary!) to access SR on a phone that is connected to your real identity in any way.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

The idea is that it is portable, encrypted and can be ditched quickly if necessary. Take a look at TAILS and Liberte first, they are definitely the easiest methods for security newbies, IMO :) Good luck!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Just a heads up, if you really wanted to you can install linux on a windows pc,<br />most pc&#039;s are strong enough to handle more then one OS format<br /><br /><br />The letters seem to load though but Im new to this site.. could it be a java issue with the notebook, or the fact that it&#039;s an encrypted forum - you may not be able to receive the verification if it needs to view certificates..<br /><br />Simple and short:&nbsp; new os probably wont do it

				It&#039;s possible to use Silk Road safely on a Samsung Tablet, linux can be easily installed. However even though the Android Market has a Tor Application there are a number of ways to reveal your identity.

				If you&#039;re just looking, perhaps on an account you never order from, and not worried about security etc then&nbsp; justneed to enable java script to log in from your phone. Should be somewhere in the browser settings.
