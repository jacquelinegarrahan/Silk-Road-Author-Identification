				I&#039;ve been using bitcoinfog since I started using SR a few months ago with no problems ever. Last night I withdrew a small amount (.33btc) from bitcoinfog to my SR account. I haven&#039;t been able to chec it all day because it seemed like it wouldn&#039;t connect ever. When I finally got on my balance is still the same. I copied and pasted the wallet address directly so I know I didn&#039;t mess that up and bitcoin fog gave me the confirmation that I withdrew it.<br /><br />I contacted bitcoin fog and have yet to hear back. Has anyone had this problem? Any suggestions? Is my money gone?<br /><br />Thank you for any and all help...

				Seems to be a pretty big problem today with lack of btc being deposited,&nbsp; has anything like this happened before?<br /><br />My only worry is that the price of bitcoins will crash over the next 12 hours making em less valuable.. unlikely but hey stranger things have happened
