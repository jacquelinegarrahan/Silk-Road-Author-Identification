				Hello,<br />just wanted to keep track of this experiment that looks promising ....<br />I have been diagnosed with bipolar, although I feel more the lows than the highs, and the highs are managable .... The lows are not anymore, tried all sort of medication (SSRI, family only). And I have enough of it ... it just ruins my sexlife, and I am not sure my mood is improved, so this is not an option any more ....<br />So I&#039;ve decided to use ketamine. After some research I will just snort it. It seems the easiest. I have never tried it.<br />So I should receive my delivery next week, and I will report the effects.<br />At the moment seriously depressed... I really hope it will work ...<br />I&#039;ll let you know

				Hey, I got BP too.<br />I tried ket.&nbsp; It was fun, but not really a cure.&nbsp; Cheap to play with and safe .&nbsp; It didn&#039;t do much for me but distracted me in a happy way for sure.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to have something on hand to snort.&nbsp; :-). <br /><br />It sounds to me like you could benefit from testosterone.&nbsp; &nbsp; Doctor will never give it to you , because its abused so much.&nbsp; Get it here on the road.&nbsp; Cheap.&nbsp; I had to use it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I can start to feel it working.&nbsp; More sex drive, happier , aggressive and outgoing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nice.&nbsp; It&#039;s about. $134. For 10 weeks of it.&nbsp; That&#039;s a high dose that will also grow mass and if you work out muscles.&nbsp; Half of that dose for hormone therapy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read up on it.&nbsp; Testosterone depletion in winter is a one.&nbsp; Even for ladies apparently.&nbsp; <br />

				Hi, thanks for the advice. <br />I&#039;ll check the ketamine first, and if it&#039;s not working will check my testosterone level, never thought about it ...<br /><br />Still waiting for the postman...

				You might find this interesting, its a regime by a guy who has treated himself with ketamine for BP too. http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/372731-Jamshyd-s-Medicinal-Ketamine-Regimen!-(V-1-5-UPDATED-11-22-10) I hope this helps, good luck!<br />

				If you do this for your depression (not really been shown helpful for manics afaik, but I can look into it) you should use a low to medium dose.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a &quot;K-hole&quot; is necessary for what you speak of.&nbsp; The results have typically only lasted 2-4 weeks though so this would either become a regular thing (not recommended as a health professional), or you could use it to lend you some time while you find something more long-term.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; I really hope it helps you!

				I currently take AVANZA atm but definately will be reading up about using ketamine. I heard its a scary drug though but someone in my area has access to ER stash at the local hospital so I mite try getting a hookup. Some links to good harm reduction threads would be good if someone could PM me if they get bored :) Thnx

				Thank you all for the advices ...<br />I am getting quite confused, read so many different opinions ...<br />about this http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/372731-Jamshyd-s-Medicinal-Ketamine-Regimen!-(V-1-5-UPDATED-11-22-10), it seems so complicated ...<br />In the studies I read, I have seen .5mg/kg intravenous, which for me would be 40mg.<br />As I will be snorting, I am not sure about the dosage .... Reading dosage on erowid tells me a light one is 15-30mg ...<br />

				Exercise has been shown to reduce depression more than drugs, but more often than not its just your situation in life that causes it.

				I feel like a drug alone is not going to help you with your issues. I&#039;m not saying it wouldn&#039;t work but i think there would need to be some controlled therapy that went along with using the ketamine, though I&#039;m no psychiatrist. I&#039;m rather interested to see how it works for you please let us know how it works for you.

				The experiment is delayed, I&#039;ve chosen to give another go to an other antidepressant (Wellbutrin)... and I&#039;ll see if that one works ... I prefer to use an easier drug to take ... but it that doesn&#039;t work I&#039;ll be back here certainly ... we&#039;ll see ...<br />Thank you for your advices ...

				Ketamine does wonders for depression.&nbsp; But it&#039;s also tends to be habit forming and tolerance develops quickly - I personally need half a gram to feel anything.
