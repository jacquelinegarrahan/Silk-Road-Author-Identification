				Hi! :)<br /><br />I want to get some Adderall shipped to Norway. I&#039;d much prefer just buying it from someone locally, but Adderall is practically impossible to find here so that&#039;s not really an option. I&#039;m thinking that buying from Scandinavia\United Kindom is the best way to go. I don&#039;t have the balls to order from America or Australia or whatever as that strikes me as way more risky.<br /><br />I&#039;m a complete newbie but I&#039;ve been browsing the forums and reading up on shipping for a couple of hours. At first I wanted to get a fake post box (good luck..) and have it shipped there, but the safest way seems to be, surprisingly enough, to have it shipped to my address in my own name. (?)<br /><br />I considered modifying my name a little bit like so many others on here recommend, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;d be very smart considering I know for a fact my post office notices the name it&#039;s sent to and not just the address and that my package would stand out. (I had some beauty projects ordered to my house and only filled in my first and maiden name (I don&#039;t like my last name but haven&#039;t gotten around to changing it yet) and I received the package with my last name scribbled after the name I&#039;ve provided and underlined, lol..)<br /><br />So.. any tips? I really want to research this as much as possible and be smart about this. I know there will always be some risk involved but I figured I&#039;d be safe considering how anyone could send me drugs in the mail, I have no priors or whatever and I&#039;m a model citizen. I can say for a fact that NO ONE would believe me buying drugs.<br /><br />I guess my question is really about shipping in general and if what I&#039;ve said makes sense so far. Do you guys agree on my thoughts on buying from Scandinavia\United Kingdom being the way to go? (It sucks of course because most Adderall sellers are from the US, so you know.)<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if I sound really dumb or whatever. I did my best to learn as much as possible before making this top.<br /><br />Thank you very much if you took the time to read this :)

				Hey Vixen 13, I know how you feel, I ordered about 2 weeks ago 3 items from 3 different vendors, and let me tell you that I live in Malaysia, drugs are not tolerated nicely. 100g of weed and its death sentence, worse if its hard drugs. But I took the risk. <br /><br />The only stupid thing I did was modify my name, but it wasn&#039;t a local name, but it was too late and I had already sent my details to the vendors. In the End, I was happy to receive my items the following week, and 2 of the vendors were based in Netherlands and 1 from Italy. <br /><br />I was really happy that It came, the 3rd package took way too long, (11 days), whereas the other 2 took 7 and 8 days to arrive. <br />Anyways sorry to ramble on, I suggest still, modifying your first name possibly, because as long as your last name is there, the post office might think its a relative of yours, or your sister etc. Its not like they know that correct? <br /><br />You just have to make sure you find a reputable vendor with good ratings, i suggest going through them to make sure they aren&#039;t fake 5/5&#039;s that the vendor hasn&#039;t done them by himself. Also If you have the cash, pick the best stealth option if they have one, just to decrease you chances of getting caught. <br />Thing is what I ordered were all from regular mail, how many Adderalls do you plan to buy? And yeah, I agree, its better to have it from somewhere from the EU, just for sakes of fast delivery really. Heck, if i made it through with ordering from 3 vendors at the same time from a strict, Muslim country across the world from EU, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Oh and if you are receiving a package, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard this a lot but make sure your vendor mails it so that you don&#039;t sign (unless its regular mail) or unless the vendor will say you&#039;ll have to sign it, which is very very unlikely. But anyways if the mailman does ask you to sign, deny deny deny, act dumb and say you werent expecting a package, it could be controlled. <br /><br />Again, try just changing your first name, and to a local ish name around your town maybe? And I think mailing to your home would be easier and possibly safer, because a Post box might require you to get a fake ID so that you can set one up with a different name.. which is too much of a burden. Not to mention if you do use a pseudonym for your mailing address that is to your post box, the people who receive it might ask questions, i don&#039;t really know, just a guess.. <br /><br />Just plan it out and you&#039;ll be fine! <br /><br />Sorry for the long read :S<br /><br />*Check out http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0<br />Its a thread I just saw, its a great read if you have the time. Its some insight on the mailing system and may be very helpful in alleviating your worries even more :)
