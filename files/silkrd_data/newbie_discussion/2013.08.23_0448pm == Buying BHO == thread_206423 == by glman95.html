				Hey guys, I&#039;m obviously new to silkroad and I was wondering what vendors are best for buying high quality fully purged BHO for my vape pen. What I found so far is three vendors: CannabisArbiter, Weedmaps, and High4Daze. Weedmaps is new and High4Daze said he switched to SR from Atlantis. Any feedback would be much appreciated. I&#039;m looking for about an eighth of and indica and a quarter of a sativa.

				If you need something for your vape pen, check out my skunk #1 oil;&nbsp; I highly suggest it for pens such as the cloud, g or other varients using a cartridge atomizer!&nbsp; I&#039;m also working on providing some co2 oils and syringes for portability and pens as well as some edibles and candies so check back soon. <br /><br />Just to note... all of my products are processed in a clean lab like environment and all oils are fully vacuum purged for a minimum of 24 hours. I take pride in my work and I work hard to source some of the finest quality buds and trim to make oils and other products with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Give it a shot, I promise I won&#039;t let ya down ;-) my goal is to keep all my customers high4daze.<br /><br />-H4D<br /><br />
