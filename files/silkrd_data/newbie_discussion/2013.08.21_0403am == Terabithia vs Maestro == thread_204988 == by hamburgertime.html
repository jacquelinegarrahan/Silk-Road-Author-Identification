				Has anyone tried BOTH of them? I&#039;ve tried Terabithias stuff and i really like it, but its usually light and takes days, sometimes almost a week to show up even with overnight shipping. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that Maestro sells fat bags, supposedly 3-5 times bigger than the competition, although he is more expensive than terabithia. <br /><br />of course both guys claim HIGH quality. My question is whos bags weigh more and by how much? who has more quality? is it a night and day difference or can you just sort of barely tell? who&#039;s faster shipping their product? <br /><br />thanks!

				They all claim &#039;high quality&#039;. To me , that only means good cut is used, heh. <br /><br />Ive never tried Tera, because ive never really read any good reviews from users i can trust to tell good from ok. Maestros first and second batch where ok, pretty good for stamps. After that he seemed to have declined in quality. <br /><br />I now will only order stamps from deluxe delivery, deezletime and some more often when buying stamps ill go with dieseltherapy. Dtherapy has good bang for your buck. DDelivery has the best stamps bar none, but there really light most of the time. Dtime i havnt yet tried personally, but ive been told by reliable sources, its usually good enough.<br /><br />

Have you tried his Blue Diamond and the generic &quot;gram of heroine&quot; that he sells for 80ish? I wass considering buying from Dtherapy, but didn&#039;t know whether to get the BD or the generic H. <br /><br />Does Dtherapy hook it up and give extras? <br /><br />I ordered the brick from Tera and he gave me 10 free bags <br /><br /><br /><br />edit: damn deezletime hooks up a brick/ 50 bags for 1 BTC cheaper than Tera. def gona give that a try next time

				Ive yet to be hooked up more by a vendor than i have by Dtherapy. He always gives something extra. Some times more than others, but always something added on for the custy. <br /><br />I dont know what you mean by &#039;generic&#039; in his cheaper shit. Its got heroin in it, heh, just not very much. Certainly go with his BD. Ive had it and it was certainly way better than the 3 prior orders i had from him before trying the new BD batch. <br /><br />How sure are you that you know what good heroin is? I ask because ive never heard some one that im sure knows real, good dope, say that tera&#039;s H is anything more than &#039;OK if your sick&#039;.<br /><br />If your looking to get more than a couple stamps, i have to suggest you go with Subsrgood, i think hes having listings all week, first round began today. Now thats raw dope. Excellent afghan H. It lacks in some areas, like euphoria and nod to mg ratio.. but its so warm and lovely. He has 250mg for like 65 bucks or something like that.<br /><br />&nbsp;If your getting a few stamps, try deluxe delivery man.. last time i had it, i was in heaven. Fucking FIRE.

I&#039;m guessing Subsrgood has wayyy higher quality than the others, because his prices are pretty steep. <br /><br />I&#039;m def giving deluxe delivery a try next time. thanks for pointing me in his direction man. <br /><br />and yea I&#039;m a newcomer when it comes to dope. I&#039;ve done black tar with my friend and honestly it wsa shit. i also did dialudid. so when i tried powdered H for the first time it was a night and day difference. I suppose i always assumed it was because Tera had great quality. but i&nbsp; haven&#039;t tryied anything else to be honest.

				Yea dude, go with either SRG or DD. SRG&#039;s shit is real good, but different from DDs shit. DDs gear is the like the quality stamps i used to get in brooklyn decades ago. Nothing has held a candle to that shit yet, and DDs stamp came damn close. <br /><br />Im actually buzzn on a few mgs of SRGs shit. His prices are steep, but on par with good quality heroin here on SR, infact its fairly cheap considering what other vendors in the past have charged for equal or lesser quality work. <br /><br />Therapy is good when your strapd for cash, or just looking to drop spare change on a stamp or two. Hes a great vendor, but the quality has yet to be all that and a bag of chips, so to speak. haha

They&#039;re light as fuck though. Like 25-40mg per stamp. The price is good, but what makes him stand out is his shipping. If you buy by his cut off it WILL be sent out that day. Each time&nbsp; I order express by the cutoff, it&#039;s in my hand less than 24 hours later.<br /><br />Convenience is big for me, so while they&#039;re light, the shipping makes it the good deal for me (no heroin where I live, so I can&#039;t just go get it somewhere).
