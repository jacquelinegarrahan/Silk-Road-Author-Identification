				Nevermind -- I looked it up on blockchain.info and see it has 5 confirmations.&nbsp; It won&#039;t show up in your wallet here until at least 6-7 confirmations.

				Please don&#039;t rush into making a purchase before you&#039;ve spent some time reading up on how to do so safely.&nbsp; Do you know how to use PGP to encrypt your address?&nbsp; That, for instance, is something you NEED to know how to do in order to buy safely on SR.

				Please heed Scout&#039;s advice. One of the best things about the delays in getting money to BTC on the road is that you have time to think about what you want to do and read up on how things work.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be in too much of a rush, many recreational users are impulsive and this is not a good place to do things without knowing how they work.

				scout...i send you many thanks. i would like to say my experience here so far has been similar to sammyjenkins404. i have been luring around for just short of a month..then about 2 weeks back i went ahead and got a userid...then i had some trouble accessing the page and i went to the &quot;hidden wikki&quot; and hit that sight that asks you for that pin.. i then realized that i had been phished. i felt like an idiot because i knew better but you live and learn. i then decided to create another account. i got the pgp and i am getting ready for my first bitcoin transaction.&nbsp; its just a good thing to know that you are around to lend a hand....one question...what is up with the need to get 50 posts and the spamming done to get them? is it simply to be able to post in other forums?
