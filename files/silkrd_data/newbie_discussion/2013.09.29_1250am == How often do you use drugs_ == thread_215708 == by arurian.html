That shit is nasty!<br />Oxy&#039;s -- several times per week.<br />Shrooms -- once or twice a year<br />Alcohol -- once or twice a year if that<br />Coke -- one every year or two<br />LSD -- has been 10 years but probably soon<br /><br />Still looking to try molly, and dmt, and possible designer drugs like 2CE.<br /><br />Et vous mon frere (ou mon soeur)?<br />

				There are some prescription medications I take on a daily basis, as prescribed...<br /><br />Uh, recreational use? Ketamine once in a while, Shrooms once every couple of years, ..., my cannabis use is highly variable (at most frequent once every couple weeks, at least frequent, once a year or two). Opiate use for me has recently become more frequent, and I think it&#039;s something I should monitor carefully. Haven&#039;t had any alcoholic beverages in a couple months, and...I&#039;ve been taking benzodiazepines a couple to a few times a week (it&#039;s not prescribed), which I don&#039;t like.

				Usually smoke weed daily but currently taking a short break.&nbsp; Don&#039;t drink very often maybe once a week.&nbsp; Ill have a few drinks with dinner if I go out.&nbsp; Big fan of stimulants and mdma but limit myself to one weekend or so a month, sometimes longer intervals.&nbsp; Lsd, shrooms, and pain relievers just randomly but not often.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tripped in probably 3 years or so.

				Caffeine, theophylline, theobromine and L-theanine: almost constantly (in mugs of tea).<br />Nicotine: again almost constantly<br />Sertraline: prescribed twice a day but haven&#039;t taken any this year<br />Ramipril: once a day<br />Alcohol: usually between three to six days a week<br />Cannabis: usually between one to six days a week<br />Cocaine: around three or four times a year<br />MDMA and 2C-B: three or four times a year the last couple of years but the friend I used to do them with has now given them up.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably forgetting some things but everything else I can think of, including analgesics, falls below thrice a year. I have recently purchased new stuff to experiment with, though :)

				I smoke weed constantly, trip 3-4 times a year and I dabble in opiates and stimulants, but I can&#039;t do either for more than a couple of days in a row, then I need weeks to dry out.<br /><br />I use MDMA or MDA more often than I should, but try to space it out to 3 months.<br />I would trip all the damn time if it weren&#039;t for tolerance and mood. I&#039;m trying to keep it special.

				Weed or other Marijuana Products : Everyday, probably about every 50 minutes or so if everything is going my way<br />Amphetamine Salts: Daily<br />Psychedelics: I try to keep my trips to every other weekend these days, generally an L trip if I am though<br />MDMA: Probably only about once a month now<br />Opium: My guilty pleasure, probably about once every 2-3 months<br />I&#039;ll do some not as mainstream substances like salvia every now and again but I generally just smoke pot with the promise of a trip and a good roll around the corner.

				Damn guys.<br /><br />I usually smoke weed at most once or twice a month. In a more heavy period, once or twice a week.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m really good at holding temptation. I&#039;m really obsessed with anticipation and &quot;peak moments&quot;.<br /><br />You can probably guess how low my tolerance is,&nbsp; :D which is pretty awesome to me. 1g of medicinal can last me more than 5 sessions.

				if weed is a drug- daily. really, i dont have any problems through that(except of getting a bit shy). im able to concentrate on what im doin, i can ignore whats stressing me, and im extremely creative. and that after a half year of nonstopconsuming. <br />im now doing 3-4 days without, just to become again a feeling of how world looks normaly. slowly i realize, how boring and fucked up everything is. i can tell you, my life always sucked a bit, but never was rly bad. but dope helps me to get smthing to belive in it. im dealing to get my people here clean, uncut weed. im dreaming of legalization, opening a coffeshop/dispensory or something other, im sure, my life got better with MJ!<br />sometimes i use uppers like coke, 3fa &amp;co, but maybe once every 3 months.<br />alcohol&amp;psychedelics NEVER!
