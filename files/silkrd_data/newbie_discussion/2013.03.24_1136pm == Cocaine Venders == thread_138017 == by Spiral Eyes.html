				Hey folks. Anyone care to discuss their favorite coke venders and why they are? I&#039;m looking for some at least half decent blow that isn&#039;t way too fucking expensive. Good coke for $60-100&nbsp; a gram?

				I see a handful of venders selling grams for $60-100, and I guess I&#039;m wondering if any of it is decent, actual coke. I&#039;ve been reading posts about some bad product and tests showing methylone and all sorts of other shit. Yes, I see some 540 page threads, and other outdated info on product that was around 2 months ago...&nbsp; I&#039;ll just keep digging. I was just hoping someone could save me five days worth of reading and recommend some good cheap coke.&nbsp; ;D

				godofall has excellent, acetone washed cocaine.<br /><br />I have heard Nod has great stuff but haven&#039;t tried it yet.<br /><br />I highly recommend paying the market rate for a vendor with great reviews.&nbsp; You get what you pay for.

				I would recommend&nbsp; Imports, I&#039;ve bought from him quite a few times in the past and he has always come through, he also has acetone washed cocaine from time to time, I&#039;m sure if you messaged him he would tell you when he&#039;s getting it next if he is, but other than that good quality.

Seems like a lot of money to be just giving it away. I hope I&#039;m wrong and it works out for everyone. I haven&#039;t done coke in quite a while, but I&#039;ve got a few &quot;friends&quot; who want to buy some from me. But street coke around here is going for about $100 a gram, so I&#039;m trying to find shit on SR that is at least equal in quality, but cheap enough that I can still make some money. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have a market for anything over $120 a gram. So far it seems like Pablos Puro might be my guy. I can definitely deal with slow shipping as long as quality is as advertised, and it appears to be. I&#039;d love to hear a few more reviews on his social coke before I pull the trigger though...

				You can go with BCPLTD<br /><br />Ordered with him and got my stuff today, and you can buy it by the point so you can spend as much or as little as you like. Pretty legit product too. Aside from him, I go with BaddaBoom when I want to save a bit.
