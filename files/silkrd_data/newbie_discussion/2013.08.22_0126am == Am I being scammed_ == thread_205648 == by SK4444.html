				Hi all I hope you can help explain the escrow system a bit more to me. I ordered from a merchant 12 days ago, and apparently he&#039;s behind on shipping. The order status is &quot;processing&quot; with auto-finalize saying N/A. So at this point, he won&#039;t get the money automatically after x number of days, correct? He would have to mark it as shipped (so does it change to transit instead of processing?) and it auto finalizes 17 days later from the shipping date? Thanks for your help.

				If its still processing you can cancel the order, if you want to. But no, the counter on auto finalization doesn&#039;t start until the order is marked in transit. Then its 17 days until it auto finalizes. I hate to say but most buyers would cancel that order and buy from someone else..that is not a vendor most would want to deal with. Unless you have messaged with the vendor and there is some reason you would let the order go in transit.

				Yeah cancel the order!!! And give us the name of the vendor. All scammers need to be called out. So many vendors have fake reviews it is hard to find a legit.

				This John Dane guy has no idea what he&#039;s talking about, he thinks bitcoins are stupid and we should switch to using moneygrams so the cops can trace our payments back to our home addresses lol.&nbsp; Anyways you didn&#039;t get scammed!!&nbsp; It will say processing until the seller has shipped your product out, at which time it will say in transit.&nbsp; STILL the merchant does NOT have your money, because the money remains in ESCROW hidden from both of you, until you receive the order he sent you.&nbsp; Once you confirm it REALLY IS the item you purchased, you click on FINALIZE and write a review, and it is ONLY AFTER YOU CLICK FINALIZE, that the money is transferred from Escrow, to the seller.&nbsp; GET IT???

				Maybe the vendor has a good reason why he didn&#039;t shipped your order. There could be 101 reasons. If I were you, send the (wo)man a PM and if you won&#039;t get any answer, cancel the order if you feel like doing so. <br /><br />Scammer on SR equals asking customers FE, after FE no reply to messages.<br /><br />People have forgotten there are factors outside the vendor that could influence your order.
