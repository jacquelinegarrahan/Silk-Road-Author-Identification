				Cannabis butter:<br />Break it up well and simmer with butter and water, at least one part water to one part butter, preferably two to one.&nbsp; The more fiber, the more water.&nbsp; Don&#039;t bother trying with less than 1/4 plus 1 pound butter (for water, a pint is still a pound, and you will simmer off at least a pint in an hour while needing water left behind.). After simmering for an hour, the most important thing is to strain and squeeze.&nbsp; The butter is stuck in the fiber, you don&#039;t want the fiber anymore but you want the butter.&nbsp; Use cheesecloth, 2-4 layers, as a strainer, then ball it like a poultice and twist it as hard as you can to remove the butter/water/liquid from the fiber. You&#039;re left with a bowl of green/brown buttery water.&nbsp; Place the bowl in the refrigerator and come back tomorrow. Discard the fiber, it is done. <br /><br />The next day: The butter should now be butter again, on top of a layer of swamp water.&nbsp; Hopefully you made enough and used an appropriately sized container that the butter layer can be removed as a solid and saved in the fridge. If not, you will need to skim it off, then discard the swamp water.<br /><br />Now cook with your butter.&nbsp; Anything that calls for butter works, but do not heat it much above 350F (baking temperature for brownies).&nbsp; You can still spoil it with heat.&nbsp; <br />The concentration and resulting effect will depend entirely on what you put in the kettle in the first place. This process is not terribly efficient if used with anything good or with any small quantity. Really, it is silly to cook anything good.&nbsp; If it is good, you shouldn&#039;t be smoking enough to do lung damage.&nbsp; If you have a desire/need to eat it, you&#039;re better off going with something you wouldn&#039;t want to smoke.&nbsp; This process I describe was developed for people with large quantities of low concentration seconds.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are so lucky as to be able to produce anything in high concentration or volume do be careful.&nbsp; The effect is delayed and can take people by surprise.&nbsp; <br />

				Any old cookie/muffin/brownie mix from a supermarket with go nicely with whatever hash you have.... weed works well too, although tastes a bit herby/chewy bits, make sure you pick out any stems and grind it up well if you use weed&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I made a batch of 2g of my Skunk Berry (shameless plug - check my listings! lol) in 4 double choc-chip cookies. I ate 2 of them approx 5pm... from 6pm to midnight I was absolutely fucked, sat there staring at the TV in and out of conscienceness/falling asleep! Not recommended lol!

				Banana muffins<br /><br />2 (over)ripe bananas <br />1.5 cup flour<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 egg<br />.5 cup cannabis butter, melted<br />1 tsp baking soda<br />1 tsp vanilla <br /><br />Mix all ingredients in a bowl until batter-like in consistency. Put batter in liners and bake at 350 degrees for about 20-25 minutes. After they&#039;re a golden brown color, remove from oven and let cool, preferably if you have a wire rack or something for them to sit on. They should cool for at least about 7-10 minutes before you start tearing into them. My biggest problem when making these with weed is that I will want to eat the entire plate at this point, which would be a very bad idea.

Always pick out the brownie mix with the most oil/butter called for in the recipe.&nbsp; simmer on low heat the oil/butter with your well grinded bud for about 15 mins, stirring often. if there is any smoke coming off the mixture it&#039;s too hot, turn down the heat!&nbsp; &nbsp;then strain out the weed.&nbsp; The thc will stay in the oil/butter.&nbsp; Then cook it up per the recipe.<br />

				I&#039;ve always been a fan of &quot;fire crackers&quot;...So easy to make and takes way less time than most other recipes.
