				Hello,<br />I am new to this community, i first ordered&nbsp; 2 grams of weed, which arrived to me after 1.5 weeks and<br />when i came home there it was on the table in small evelope, omg i have fun with that :)<br /><br />the second time i ordered 7 grams of weed but it didn&#039;t arrive so i though it was lost or somthing.<br />but now i received an notification that it is waiting for me in the post office and i need to go and get it,<br />although the name is not my name, exept my last name.<br />i checked the code (RR423463...) and it was sent from the place i ordered it from, so defently if was my order.<br />i&#039;v read about not to sign anything, but how am i suppose to get it if i dont sign ?<br />and how to be secured about it ? when i go get it should i open it (incase the police is following)?<br />please advice me if anyone had gone the same proccess as this and what best to do incase i get caught<br /><br />thanks!

				I really doubt they&#039;d set up a sting over 7g, you probably missed a recorded delivery or the package wouldnt fir through the letter box<br /><br />If you REALLY wanna be 100% safe, let it go<br /><br />If you want to be 90% safer than you are (and you&#039;re already pretty safe) get the package, then write RETURN TO SENDER on the back and leave it for 3 days.. but i&#039;m prett ysure you&#039;l be fine. Its 7g man, not 7kg!<br /><br />+i think thts a uk tracker, if so, its 99.99% ok.

				Go pick it up, if it is a clever LE trap you can still deny ordering it just as much as if it was in your letter box, just chuck the &quot;I have no idea who/where its from, I got a notification to pick up a parcel so I came to get it but dont know what it is&quot;&nbsp; just have a dumb confused look on your face when you pick it up

I personally love it (in moderation of course and when circumstances permit).<br /><br />This thread is a classic example of someone rushing into things and making crucial mistakes which could have easily been avoided. When you place an order, YOU, the buyer, chooses the postage option you want from the options given to you by the vendor, from standard mail to Express Post and a host of other options dependent on where you live in the world. Surely if you didn&#039;t choose a shipping option which requires a signature and a card is left for you to pick up the order at the Local Post Office and sign for it, something isn&#039;t right! However, more importantly, why are you having packages delivered to your residential address where you live? <br /><br />I&#039;m certainly not understanding the whole &quot; when i went down stairs there was a cop car arriving slowly to my house entrance, i kept going to my car and drove back to the post office and gave that shit back said it wasn&#039;t for me i didn&#039;t order there. when i was near post office i had the same police car going near it probbly looking for me or somthing, but they never followed me so i can see them behind..&quot; thing????? So a cop car arrived slowly to your house yet they just let you continue to walk to your car and drive to the P.O, drop the gear off and drive back home without talking to you at all??? <br /><br />That makes no sense at all. Are you sure it&#039;s not a case of some serious paranoia??

				Guys be serious for a minute seriously, i bought half a gram of weed yesterday domestically and it hasnt arrived today, the postman gave me a really knowing look and said &#039;hi&#039; in a really sinister manner. Theres also been a tinted van that i can just make out in the distance that hasnt moved for 24hours.. i&#039;m starting to get really worried :( Should i skip the country? In fact maybe the best option would just to go in and confess all my crimes, they&#039;d go easier on me then, right? Yeah, i&#039;ll do that, thanks guys

Then, when you open the package, find the football and mandy, you do a bomb of MDMA and rush around hugging everything, football included, and they have all the evidence they need to put you on the chair. Sad, but that system actually works, they catch loads of fellas that way, google it :(

				You guys are a riot... but seriously, you can&#039;t blame a newb for being nervous. I&#039;m a long time lurker who just finally got around to depositing some BTC. Trying to educate myself so I can be as stealthy as possible making my first order. Whether it&#039;s a little bit of pot or a crack rock, you&#039;re still ordering drugs through the mail. This is the Newbie section, after all... we can&#039;t help but be a little nervous!<br /><br />Glad for this thread. I will be all the more careful about what postage option I choose.

				To the OP and anyone else in a similar situation I would say the first rule is to get into the mindset of a perfectly everyday person who&#039;s received a mail collection notice, then take things from that perspective (including wanting to know why it wasn&#039;t delivered initially).<br /><br />To the rest of you pisstakers...<br /><br />:D<br /><br />I just hope that any... overstimulated... readers aren&#039;t taking your comments too seriously :)

It&#039;s just the vibe I got looking at postage options for different listings, not sure why. Thanks for the correction, I will probably be choosing First Class to ease my mind with my first order.

				Im in us, use legit name and address that postman knows and First Class is the only way i go if possible.&nbsp; Never had a missed package.&nbsp; Sometimes they bring to door or put in mailbox depending on size of package.

				yea be easy on the guy. Hes obviously very stressed out. Overactive imagination or victim of circumstance. I dont think though that the police would simply let you walk out with a package they knew had an illegal substance in it, but then again since he never opened it we may never know if anything was there or not.<br />I live in an area and am always getting mail with other peoples names on it so its no biggie to use a different name. Trust me its common place on a weekly basis. Its actually really weird how so many names with my address get stuck in my mail box. But i guess thats the norm in a larger city. That wasnt sarcasm by the way. <br />There was a really good post from a guy that was a postal inspector in training on one of these forums everyone should read. Has some great insight
