				There is no such thing as deleting a bitcoin address. <br /><br />Bitcoin addresses start existing on the network when first seen in a valid transaction. The person with the matching private key can transfer bitcoins from that address. It is even possible to generate a valid bitcoin address without knowing the private key (nobody would be able to transfer bitcoins from that address).<br /><br />If the private key for a certain bitcoin address is lost, the address becomes unusable (though bitcoins can still be transferred to it). This happens all the time and there is a significant amount of bitcoins that has been &#039;lost&#039;, but there is no explicit &#039;deletion&#039; of the address. Remember there is no central authority for bitcoin addresses.<br /><br />I guess this doesn&#039;t fully answer your question - I don&#039;t really know what you observed in the blockchain, but it was not a &#039;deleted&#039; address.

				Well what i observed was simply that i found an address on the blockchain that i simply couldnt click.. it was like it got deleted or something, i couldnt click it anymore, so i could also not see where the funds went that got send from the known adress to the now unknown one..

				On blockchain.info you can go-to receive money then click actions - archive address, I think this is what may have happened.
