				I&#039;m sure this question has been answered a million times, but how long does SR usually stay down for when it goes out like this??? Will this delay any of my pending orders??<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance!!! :)

				It&#039;s not really a common thing for us to get attacked like this. DPR&#039;s last comment was to expect at least 2 days before they find a solution (apparently it&#039;s a particularly nasty and organized attack). <br /><br />As for your orders, it really depends if your vendor was able to access SR and process your order before the site shut down completely. And you probably wont know until the site goes back up again. <br /><br />Good luck!

				I&#039;ve never seen it go down from an attack, from maintenance ya, for maybe half a day max, but not sure how long is the longest but this could be a new record.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty vicious attack and they might have to resort to some time consuming DNS trickery measures and change the address of the main website etc. etc. and that does take days, even if they have the plan already finished on the chalk board.

				Maintenance could be pretty long in the early days, I hear we&#039;re spoiled in that. We&#039;d have to be down for weeks to break any of those records.

				Sorry that this is off topic.&nbsp; Just want to make sure this doesn&#039;t happen to anyone else:<br /><br />and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...
