				Please post your Trip Experiences here after trying the ordered items and experiencing its full effects in a positive setting and environment !<br /><br />Every single item is of the highest potency and quality, but don&#039;t be surprised if you experience little to no effects dropping it after eating a bunch of pizza with dairy products and avocados for a week prior !<br /><br />Mixing Alcohol with Anything is Never a good idea !<br />Try to drink as little as possible, Alcohol damages the receptors responsible for enabling you to experience real highs<br /><br />Before taking ANY Psychedelic, especially Mushrooms, LSD, DMT, and MDMA which I carry, always CLEANSE Your Body and Your Mind, with a healthy fast, moderate exercise, fresh air, and lemon juice to alkalize your body with essential electrolytes,<br /><br />then Meditate, Focus and eat as little as possible, don&#039;t over-exert yourself with exercise, do it lightly in moderation<br /><br />Don&#039;t take a hot shower for at least 1 day prior to trip experience<br /><br />Always do every psychedelic on an empty stomach, following a Vegetarian diet which excludes vegetable oils (such as nuts and avocados) for at lest 2-3 days beforehand ! <br />- that&#039;s the minimum for how long your body takes to clear itself of all this junk if leading a healthy lifestyle, which blocks and down-regulates your neural pathways<br /><br />No Dairy, No Gluten, or Spinach, etc. to keep your Opiate receptors Clean and Clear,<br />and of course, as we all should now, psychedelics barely work at all if done in combination with any opiates !<br /><br />Always stay far away from All supplements(specifically Omega oils, Vitamin E, Lecithin and Vitamins), especially pharmaceuticals, <br />all if not all of them are toxic largely due to manufacturing technique, low bio-availability and binders/fillers used, <br />these Will Always set you Off Balance from your true self<br /><br />ALL Nutrients and Minerals can be derived easily from a healthy diet full of the right choices of vegetables and fruits and non-homogenized yogurt in their raw organic state !<br /><br />BE Careful of Extra Lecithin intake coming from All cabbage family (cabbage, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, kale) All of these come from the same ancestry of plants and also have toxins in them and 2 enzymes, one of them being effectively DE-activated by subjecting it to very light heat such as steaming for 2-3mins, <br /><br />Kale is the only good plant here with minimal oxalic acid and pretty nice when consumed Juiced fresh and separated from the foamy Lecithin which is also an emulsifier<br />Same with organic Oranges, their fresh juice is simply amazing, but separate it from the pulp because that is also pure lecithin !<br /><br /><br />&lt;***********************************!!!**************************************&gt;<br /><br />POTATOES<br />/EGGPLANTS<br />/GREEN TOMATOES<br /><br />Potatoes, being very high on the Glycemic scale, also are Loaded with glycoalkaloid poisons alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine, and also Nicotine in egg-plants, which besides actively deterring proper action of acetylocholine neurotransmitter <br /><br />It is in and near the green parts where the highest concentration of solanine is to be found. Solanine is not rendered safe by boiling, baking or frying !!<br />Normally, potatoes contain between 20mg and 150mg per kilogram of raw potato, but when turned green on exposure to sunlight may contain as much as 1000mg/kg, mostly just under the skin (the shoots contain even higher amounts). <br />Solanine adds an un-pleasant bitterness to the flavour of potatoes when its concentration exceeds 200mg/kg, so potato poisoning is now rare, especially as cooks are now more aware of the dangers of greening or sprouting potatoes.<br /><br />&quot;Solanine&quot; has, amongst many other effects, a choline esterase inhibitor function and thus affects the central nervous system. <br />The symptoms of solanine poisoning are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, heart arrhythmia, dizziness, and in severe cases hallucinations, loss of feeling, paralysis, jaundice, hypothermia and death. It causes apoptosis in cells; the cells commit suicide. Between 2 and 5mg/kg of body weight will cause severe poisoning, possibly fatal.<br /><br />&quot;Demissidine&quot;, as a glycoalkaloid with glycosides attached is found in significant concentrations in the skins of un-ripe potatoes. It is reported to inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase and is also a suspected teratogenic substance, inducing gross abnormalities and birth defects in newborns (such as two heads). It modifies DNA !<br /><br />&quot;Calystegines&quot; are poly-hydroxylated nortropane alkaloids, derived from Tropane but without the methyl group on the nitrogen atom. These two are found in potatoes, Tomatoes, Sweet and Chili Peppers, Eggplants, Sweet Potatoes, Mulberries and Cabbage and are potent glycosidase inhibitors. They were first reported in plants of the Bindweed Family (Convolulaceae) but are most ubiquitous in the Nightshade Family (Solanaceae). The major proportion of these alkaloids are synthesized within the roots, and the largest increase in production was observed in tubers that have suppressed sucrose synthase activity. Increases in calystegines seems to be linked with sucrose availability.<br /><br />Calystegines are not destroyed by cooking and are stable enough to be found in processed potato products such as dried mash potato. Storage of potato tubers at 5°C increases the 4-O-α-D-galactoside of Calystegine B2 and Calystegine A3.<br /><br />The inhibition of mammalian β-glucosidase and α-galactoside activities raises the possibility of toxicity in humans when large quantities of these plants are consumed.<br /><br />Also Potatoes are very high in D3 which promotes over-absorption of Calcium in the system, leading to Calcium toxicity and calcification of circulatory system<br /><br />&lt;***********************************!!!**************************************&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br />Keep in Mind that everyone&#039;s Brain Chemistry and Receptor Density is different.<br /><br />!!!_- Please write here about all the amazing Effects and Experiences which unfold upon tripping on my Life-changing psychedelics -_!!!<br />(Best trip reports will be chosen once every 3 months and posted on Erowid to share the wisdom and increase the level of collective consciousness worldwide :D)<br /><br />Peace Love Harmony &lt;3<br /><br /><br />Your one-stop Underground Pharmacy - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9548d23b8d<br />

				I was gonna recommend you start a review thread. Once my package arrives and I try the product I will return with a report.<br />Let me just say it was a pleasure dealing with Dreamension, quick response and very helpful creating a custom order.

				I would love to hear a detailed report on Dream&#039;s DMT!<br /><br />Never done the spice before, so i figure going with a less pricey choice the first time around might be a good idea to get the hang of it. Seems like there&#039;s so many ways to mess up spice... no flame touching, vape only, not falling through and being wasted, getting dosage right, getting your tokes in properly to break through etc. it&#039;s intimidating for a noob like me, i can see why so many people have never taken the plunge with DMT yet. <br /><br />Would love to hear some more experienced psychenauts give their thoughts on Dream&#039;s DMT, and if possible in comparison to a more common variety? What are the differences in trips between them? I&#039;m not as concerned about a bit of off-putting odor, more interested in just the quality of the trip. one more mellow? easier comedown? longer afterglow? or is DMT 90% the same across the board?<br /><br />It will take me a while to save for a 0.5 of dream&#039;s, so I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s worth it? 50mg seems like i&#039;d be too afraid to mess up the process. with only one chance... already waiting for a 0.5 of another brand... and i&#039;m starting to wonder if i should have just saved to double down on dreams... ahhh choices!<br /><br />

				Title: <strong>Grade AAAmazing MDA</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>mdawesome</strong> on <strong>May 22, 2013, 11:51 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				First time ordering from Dream/the SR for that matter and I can&#039;t express enough how incredibly satisfied I am with the quality of his/her/its MDA. <br /><br />**Ordered 5g, weighed in at about 5.050g, but I probably lost a little to the packaging/didn&#039;t weigh the odds-and-ends because it was already at weight+ <br /><br />**He doesn&#039;t label packages so be careful when un-packing everything. All his substances are so pure that they are very similar in appearance, just move slow and open everything carefully (razor-blade/scalpel makes everything much easier to work with). <br /><br />**Shipping was very quick, arrived on 4th day of transit. Very stealthy, didn&#039;t realize what it was until I had opened the mail entirely. Very nice surprise!<br /><br />**1,000,000% pure. It&#039;s white powder, but very shiny in appearance. Few little shards to make the crystal-lover in me smile. Really nice to look at when poured into a pile. 100mg was enough to elicit strong effects even in the hard-head of our group (usually needs 1.5x everyone elses dose). <br /><br />**Seeing as this is as pure as it comes, I&#039;d approach 150mg+ with extreme caution -- vomiting from synthetic substances feels incredibly disgusting ... and MDA is much easier to over-do than MDMA. I&#039;ve vomited on ~300mg amber MDA crystals (~85%, 2009). It&#039;s just not worth upping the dosage to these levels, it works AMAZINGLY at 100mg. Some people may need more (or even less), but proceed with caution, this substance is beautiful, but it demands respect. Unlike most psychedelics upping dosage doesn&#039;t increase visuals, etc. It will only increase nausea, jaw-clenching, body-tremors, etc. These negative effects are all mild when you are within the correct dosage range. <br /><br />**If you want a longer trip (it already lasts a healthy 6hrs+significant afterglow) I&#039;d suggest adding a psychedelic (mushrooms and 2c-b are ideal) to the tail end of the experience, there isn&#039;t much benefit to re-dosing (if you must do it within 2hrs MAX preferably earlier, or via insuffalation). It&#039;s better to capitalize on the MDA trip by entering into something else with the MDA-mindset, using this method the MDA visuals continue into the new psychedelic and create something very unique and amazing. This addition of psychedelic delays the crash-feeling until the end of the entire experience.<br /><br />**THE CRASH: MDA has a big crash. There is no way around this. Even with material of this purity you will have to pay for your experience the next day. It&#039;s just heavy-hitting stuff. All the more reason to keep your dosage in the 100mg +/-20mg range. Every time I&#039;ve taken 150mg+ the crash has been much worse than on 100mg (without any increase in desirable effects). This will vary person-to-person, but if it&#039;s your first time using MDA I would advise scheduling the next day for hiding under your covers and nothing else. Once you have a few MDA experiences under your belt I find the crash becomes milder, without disappearing entirely. Its definitely possible to function the following day, just not advisable for your first time because the crash can very likely floor you for a day if not several depending on your health/endurance, etc.<br /><br />Effects of crash typically include: sensitivity to light, lethargy, sore jaw/teeth/lips/inner-cheeks. The last one can be prevented by chewing-gum, and/or proper jaw exercise during the experience. Headache not uncommon, but with 100mg doses I find I don&#039;t get one.<br /><br />THANKS DREAM<br />

				Purchased some old skool amber mdma from Dreamension and it was a flawless transaction!<br /><br />Communication: 5/5 - I typically don&#039;t like to bug vendors inbox with questions but I had some legitimate ones and Dreamension replied back promptly and thoroughly to everything.<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5 - Extremely good stealth on his product. Without going into too many details it blends in with regular post mail and product is well concealed and packed. Ordered from the US listing but it was shipped from Canada. No matter as I got it under a week including the holiday.<br /><br />Product: Untested...however marquis test showed product was legit and fizzled to black almost immediately and smells of anise/sass/etc<br /><br />Overall 5/5 transaction with Dreamension I look forward to reporting back after a trip test and hope to do more trading in the future!

				I purchased from DReaM, .5 g of his MDMA. Knowing it was molly, I did have high expectations. <br />&nbsp;<br />First off, it came in a good amount of time considering where it came from, it arrived in 5 days. Second, the packaging was by far the best I&#039;ve seen on SR. I saw it in my mail and I didn&#039;t even think it was actually the MDMA, I thought it was some other mail! Clever packaging, 10/5 for that! <br /><br />When I parachuted the MDMA, I knew when it hit me about 30 minutes in strong and fast. <br />Let me tell you, this stuff was amazing and I loved every second of it. I tripped for a straight 6 hours, feeling very stimulated but it was clean and not jittery in any way. All I wanted to do was dance and I did for hours. I listened to my favorite tunes and it was surreal. <br />I dipped my feet in the pool and it felt like I was dropping my feet into heaven. <br />I was blown away by this stuff, and the comedown wasn&#039;t even bad. I had no strong urge to re dose, there was virtually no comedown. <br /><br />I recently ordered some LSD from DReaM, and I can&#039;t wait to try it out because I know it&#039;s going to be fantastic!<br />I will post about it when I have tried it. <br /><br />Don&#039;t look any further, go through DReaM for all your psychedelic needs!<br />Thanks a lot DReaMensioN! 10/5 (:

				Nice report! I&#039;ve only ever experienced MDA once many many years ago, but I&#039;m trying to pull the trigger on a gram of Dream&#039;s as soon as the Road gets back up. I have a couple questions for you, please. First, I was thinking to combo with MDMA. What dosages of each would you suggest? I&#039;m a big guy around 190 lbs. I have some supertrips red question marks. I was thinking half of one (They&#039;re 180 mg, supposedly) + 50 mg of MDA and then take the other half of the question mark at + 2 hrs. Although now I&#039;m thinking maybe to take the second half of the question mark with some mushrooms, per your suggestion.<br /><br /><br />EZ <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158346.msg1155788#msg1155788">Quote from: mdawesome on May 22, 2013, 11:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First time ordering from Dream/the SR for that matter and I can&#039;t express enough how incredibly satisfied I am with the quality of his/her/its MDA. <br /><br />**Ordered 5g, weighed in at about 5.050g, but I probably lost a little to the packaging/didn&#039;t weigh the odds-and-ends because it was already at weight+ <br /><br />**He doesn&#039;t label packages so be careful when un-packing everything. All his substances are so pure that they are very similar in appearance, just move slow and open everything carefully (razor-blade/scalpel makes everything much easier to work with). <br /><br />**Shipping was very quick, arrived on 4th day of transit. Very stealthy, didn&#039;t realize what it was until I had opened the mail entirely. Very nice surprise!<br /><br />**1,000,000% pure. It&#039;s white powder, but very shiny in appearance. Few little shards to make the crystal-lover in me smile. Really nice to look at when poured into a pile. 100mg was enough to elicit strong effects even in the hard-head of our group (usually needs 1.5x everyone elses dose). <br /><br />**Seeing as this is as pure as it comes, I&#039;d approach 150mg+ with extreme caution -- vomiting from synthetic substances feels incredibly disgusting ... and MDA is much easier to over-do than MDMA. I&#039;ve vomited on ~300mg amber MDA crystals (~85%, 2009). It&#039;s just not worth upping the dosage to these levels, it works AMAZINGLY at 100mg. Some people may need more (or even less), but proceed with caution, this substance is beautiful, but it demands respect. Unlike most psychedelics upping dosage doesn&#039;t increase visuals, etc. It will only increase nausea, jaw-clenching, body-tremors, etc. These negative effects are all mild when you are within the correct dosage range. <br /><br />**If you want a longer trip (it already lasts a healthy 6hrs+significant afterglow) I&#039;d suggest adding a psychedelic (mushrooms and 2c-b are ideal) to the tail end of the experience, there isn&#039;t much benefit to re-dosing (if you must do it within 2hrs MAX preferably earlier, or via insuffalation). It&#039;s better to capitalize on the MDA trip by entering into something else with the MDA-mindset, using this method the MDA visuals continue into the new psychedelic and create something very unique and amazing. This addition of psychedelic delays the crash-feeling until the end of the entire experience.<br /><br />**THE CRASH: MDA has a big crash. There is no way around this. Even with material of this purity you will have to pay for your experience the next day. It&#039;s just heavy-hitting stuff. All the more reason to keep your dosage in the 100mg +/-20mg range. Every time I&#039;ve taken 150mg+ the crash has been much worse than on 100mg (without any increase in desirable effects). This will vary person-to-person, but if it&#039;s your first time using MDA I would advise scheduling the next day for hiding under your covers and nothing else. Once you have a few MDA experiences under your belt I find the crash becomes milder, without disappearing entirely. Its definitely possible to function the following day, just not advisable for your first time because the crash can very likely floor you for a day if not several depending on your health/endurance, etc.<br /><br />Effects of crash typically include: sensitivity to light, lethargy, sore jaw/teeth/lips/inner-cheeks. The last one can be prevented by chewing-gum, and/or proper jaw exercise during the experience. Headache not uncommon, but with 100mg doses I find I don&#039;t get one.<br /><br />THANKS DREAM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				When you mix MDMA with MDA, the dosages are usually 30-50mg of MDA to 100-120mg of MDMA,<br /><br />the order will be shipped to you&nbsp; the current ETA is 4-7days, from outpost which currently has the best stock based on your order,<br />please keep in mind that these are always rough estimates, everything depends on how busy the Post Offices are and the route the mail takes to travel to your specific location<br />For example, it can get to one location in 3-4 days one time, and get to the same location in 7-10days next time,<br />Summer time is especially random and crazy !<br /><br />Rest assure that the vendor always does everything in the powers to process and ship the order to you immediately,<br />and the Delivery Times are Always being worked on and improved upon,<br /><br />Thank you for bearing with Us, everything is getting more advanced by the day with all your lovely support :)<br /><br />there have been slight delays of 2-3days in the past week or so while we were doing maintenance and important groundwork, but that is now all completely, everything is back on track and ready to go !<br />We had quite a few deliveries of just 3days as well<br /><br />Love and Harmony &lt;3

				Received DReaMensioN&#039;s mdma pure amber oldschool&nbsp; today. It took about 8 days to get here. I was worried at first because this was my first purchase. All I can say is WOW!!!<br /><br />Product stealth is great. Product looks, smells, and feels like top quality.<br /><br />I tried it out and all I can say is OH DAMN! this is some really good MDMA. My GF gave me a blowjob and my balls were still tingling an hour later. <br /><br />I love to kick it with friends and party on E. Moreover, I love to fuck on E. This stuff is the absolute best.

				So this is my first physical purchase from SR, and as such I wanted the experience to be top notch in every aspect. That&#039;s why I chose Dreamension. I could tell immediately that his top priorities are integrity and purity, both in service and in performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;- MDMA &lt;92% 3g White lab-grade (: chill-out :)<br /><br />DELIVERY TIME : Canada -&gt; West Coast = 8 days total. Ordered Friday afternoon 6/7/13. Arrived&nbsp; Saturday afternoon 6/15/13.<br /><br />Stealth was both impressive and charming. I chuckled and then did a snoopy dance upon receiving it. <br /><br />Weighed it out: 3.06g approximately. Looks and smells legit, trying to organize a little get-together/testing-party tonight and then give a full review tomorrow. I&#039;ll fully update this with a log soon. Until then thanks Dreamension, you&#039;re awesome in so many ways. Hopefully, i&#039;ll be hitting you up again soon ;)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />UPDATE: (6/18/13)<br />sent .2g off to be lab-verified (i know a guy who knows a guy), results should be in by Wednesday.<br /><br />UPDATE: (6/19/13)<br />(currently rolling)<br />guy&#039;s guy is taking too long to fully verify, i decide Dreamension is good for his word and dose with two close friends from work. we each take a weighed out approximate does of 125mg of Dream&#039;s &lt;92% MDMA. here&#039;s the captains log, edited for clarity<br /><br />6:42 PST - we all toast and take .125mg each (oral using clear vegetable capsules)<br />7:45 - my friend, DASH, is &quot;feeling it&quot; and claiming she hasn&#039;t felt this way in years. as someone who previously thought she had lost her ability to &quot;feel the magic&quot;, we are affirmed that this is a good start<br />8:02 - feeling it. the onset is smooth and subtle, present but not overwhelming. rolling and rolling around in my California King with my besties. Life is grand. waves of euphoria and smiles for miles as Daft Punk&#039;s Discovery is playing &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;<br />8:10 - we all unanimously agree that SR is probably the best decision of my life. <br />8:34 - friends and i start impromptu jam session. great vibes all around, great music results. playing music is effortless, listening back on the session, i am surprised that we are all in tune and on time.<br />8:45 - peaks and valleys. Discovery Side C is back on. i was peaking during the jam session, i hit a valley but it is awesome and all-encompassing. not like a slow slide down, but more of a steady, consistent mellowness that permeates our bodies and loosens our souls.<br />8:49 - Marijuana is introduced and pairs well. (Sour OG (Sativa Dominant Hybrid with THC - 21% / CBD - %.09) for those of you keeping tabs).<br />9:00 - Since its a little warm we all decide to go out to the car for gum and then end up in the jacuzzi. Amazingsauce. &quot;why didn&#039;t i do this sooner&quot; flashes across my subconscious.<br />9:00-10:00 - deep philosophical conversation about work, life, and drugs commences. we all laugh, smile and swim<br />10:03 - we all run back inside freezing and hop in my shower to get warm. we dry off, i offer up spare comfy clothes, then we hop back in bed. the varying temperature shifts were not unbearable but the payoff for jumping in the shower was indescribable. hypo and hyperthermia can really dampen a roll but this one was enhanced by our ability to cope with whatever temperature shift we encountered. <br />10:25 - we put on more records, jamming out and discussing genres and artists.<br />10:30 - DASH and PINCH both agree as do i that Dreamension&#039;s MDMA is by the far the best we&#039;ve tried in our collective psychedelic journeys and thus decide that the only thing left to judge is how we act tomorrow with a 7:00AM call. <br />11:35 - DASH decides to wuss out and get some sleep before work, she&#039;s no longer rolling, just high we see her out.<br />12:30 - PINCH and I watch Postal Service perform on Colbert Report. DASH has arrived home safely. we all are winding down now for work tomorrow. <br /><br />NEXT DAY : work was fine the next day (not irritable or short-tempered with any of the usual suspects at all), mild jaw pains but otherwise no real hangover to speak of! we could all tell that the &lt;92% MDMA was insanely pure, so much so that i would hazard to guess that it&#039;s optimal venue would be in a chill environment such as one&#039;s home. DASH and PINCH both noted that it may not be as fun to do at a big festival like Coachella, although i could personally see myself having a blast in the Polo Grounds thankyouverymuch. currently debating testing out the amber 90% MDMA at HARDfest in addition to cleansing/properly dieting that last week of July. decisions decisions.<br /><br />THE VERDICT : marquis test checked out, physical test checked out, variable environment test checked out (friends &quot;had a helluva time&quot; with it at EDC, but in retrospect, found it a tad too &quot;chill&quot; for that type of environment). the roll is subtle, smooth, relaxed and philosophical. the comedown and hangover are practically non-existent, and the side-effects are the most forgiving of any MDMA experience I&#039;ve encountered. I&#039;m putting my stamp of approval all over it and recommending this product to any curious parties<br /><br />a very heartfelt THANK YOU from all of us goes out to Dreamension. words can&#039;t express our gratitude, but our bitcoin can try!<br /><br />UPDATE : will be trying out the 90% MDMA amber &quot;euphoria&quot;, MDA, and Shiva in the upcoming months. when i do i will pen a compare/contrast, captains log and full reviews. thanks Dream! keep up the good work and feel free to send any promotions my way, i will double check your potency and take extensive notes. :]

				All-Seeing Shiva Blotter<br /><br />Wow...just...wow...<br /><br />I want to send you our deepest thanks for sharing with us the tool to achieve such a profound awareness. Whatever alien planet you (and im convinced the rest of SR) come from, I thank you for your service to humanity. I am referring specifically the LSD you included for us in the package. It arrived yesterday and we thought we&#039;d take advantage of the day and split the 3 tabs about 3:2 (as I am about twice the size of my SO). It was my first time taking LSD, and her first time in over 10 years.<br /><br />Every definition I thought was rigidly cemented into my consciousness was re-evaluated and effortlessly adjusted to fit with this newly found, more apt understanding of the workings of my own universe. Definitions of love, laughter, joy, pain...as cliche as it sounds, I found new meaning in meaning.<br /><br />We dropped around 4 pm (rookie mistake, I&#039;d drop earlier next time) and explored the same park I&#039;d walked through and explored before countless times. Sitting on a bench watching the scene of a waterfall pond with a new family of swans was transformed before my eyes. It was as though the veil of my own ego and predispositions was removed for the first time ever and I could see the real world clear and unfiltered in the entirety of its perfection. We are truly blessed and are playing one gigantic joke on our collective selves carrying on as we do.<br /><br />There were plenty of animals about, pets and wild, and I will never look at another non-human neighbor the same again. Dogs seemed to absolutely spill over with love for their owners and their lives and surroundings, and looked so pure in their intent that I am inspired. Looking past the pond to the city skyline in the distance, the sky seemed to dance with birds as I was suddenly aware of dozens of them in the air simultaneously, when previously I could only be aware of one or 2 at a time. Observing their harmonious existence with the rest of the occupying matter of my viewscape (field of view) was truly a revelation.<br /><br />Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. Simply trying to put into words the depth of the experience is already cheapening it. A human construct such as language is ill-equipped to accurately portray the immensity, and all-encompassing awe and wonder of the experience; it was like I opened my eyes for the first time. Something that must be experienced to be understood, and it really is as good as it sounds.<br /><br />That being said, I worked my way up to LSD by exercising my autonomous and ever expanding free will (funny how capacity to exercise free will expands along with awareness) and dont recommend it to anyone who hasnt &quot;found it&quot; them Self. While my experience was sublime, I can easily see how someone without the life-experience (I&#039;m almost 30) would find more confusion than peace. Nobody/nothing should talk you into trying it except your Self. Interpret as you will, trust your higher voice.<br /><br />But I have seen that I am all, and all are one. I am first my Self, which is made up of.......ah hell...you&#039;ll get there eventually :)<br /><br />Main message: Do unto others, not as you would have them do to you, but do unto others as you would do to/for yourSELF. Such is the road to Heaven on Earth.<br /><br /><br />DReaMenSion - LSD-25 Blotter - All seeing Shiva - three tabs, split about 60:40 for 2 people<br /><br />Product: 10/5 - though it is only my first time with LSD, I experienced zero ill effects (other than my mind cathartically exploring a few of its darker corners), and was up for work the next day at 7:30 (on a Saturday no less) after 6 hours of sleep feeling literally brand new... I cannot imagine a better/cleaner trip (tho i experienced new limits of my ability to imagine)<br /><br />Vendor: 5/5 - Packaging is exceptional, stealth is great as well. Extremely professional/prompt and courteous. Best feeling I&#039;ve gotten from dealing with a vendor.<br /><br />Triple A+, will definitely be purchasing from this vendor again.

				Hello there, this will be a full review of DReaMensioN&#039;s service and a small array of his products; all 3 varietals of MDx, and the All-Seeing Shiva tabs, and an in-depth trip report.<br /><br />Bear with me, I&#039;m still in the process of reentering the real world.<br /><br />Initially ordered 2g MDA, and a gram each of amber and chill-out MDMA. Arrived 6 days (I think?) to the East Coast of the USA, 1.01 to a parchment slip (really good idea btw), stealth on point, except only 1g of MDA arrived, after a glitch on silkroad caused some confusion. DReaMensioN immediately responded and explained the cause of the error, I asked him to wait before reshipping, as I wanted to try the All-Seeing Shiva. 5 days (again, didn&#039;t keep great track) after ordering arrived another package with 1.25 of MDA (thanks!) and 4 tabs.<br /><br />MDMA (amber): ++++<br />MDMA (chill): ++ (not as much my thing)<br />MDA: +++++ (where it&#039;s at, getting sassy)<br /><br />All were extremely clean and enjoyable. The ratings are a little more a reflection of my personal bias towards psychedelics.<br /><br />Speaking of...<br />Wow. That was an indescribable journey, a transformative experience. I have taken L a handful of times before, but never knew exactly what dosage I was taking. I prepped all week, on a cleanse program and eating healthy, not completely raw or vegan though; sorry DReaMensioN, but I am carnivore. However, I avoided dairy for at least 2 days and red meat for 4 days. Except for that half a bacon egg &amp; cheese the morning of my trip. And a whopper jr. on the road too. Sorry. My 1 day ticket to a music festival (Firefly) in hand, I headed out to party some the night before. Probably a mistake, but fun.<br /><br />Bolting awake at noon, I screamed down to my place, showered, packed, and hit the road. Two tabs at 3:00 PM (I had originally planned on 12:30 - 1:00), arrived inside the festival grounds at around a quarter to 5, sandals immediately came off, all smiles, radiating good vibrations, yet rather introspective, sort of attempting to find 2 other groups of people who were camping there, but mostly keen to fill my hydration bladder and find a good space in the grass to put down my roots for a bit. At this point small waves were beginning to hit me, but I was still definitely coming up, that rising feeling of excitement. I find a lovely space were the music can be felt and discerned somewhat clearly, and break out the arts and crafts, a necklace I began the day before at the beach; multicolored hemp with a couple puka shell donuts and cowrie shells in a spiral pattern. Somewhere around this point, all sense of the passage of time melted away. Auditory hallucinations set in, and I thought to myself &quot;Buckle up kid; here comes the ride.&quot;<br /><br />It was at this point that I began to enter, as DReaMensioN terms it, a cosmic channel, or as I thought of it, a sort of space between &quot;dimensions&quot; for lack of a more rigorously accurate word; err...how &#039;bout hyperspace. I sensed the quantum possibilities of the macroscopic world around me; not in the sense of the linear expansion of time, the branching of alternate realities and &quot;chaos theory,&quot; but along a 5th dimension, along whose expansion existed an infinite number of parallel universes, all moving along the continuum of time together, a sort of Cartesian plane of time and...well, hyperspace. As I weaved my necklace, twisting the 4 strands of our ordinarily perceived dimensions into my personal abstraction of the 5th dimension, and as the infinity of possible universes imprinted themselves on the carefully woven hemp in my hands, a thousand different stories of myself, my friends, my family, and people I have interacted with, from scattered across this broad array of possibilities flowed through my mind, weaving themselves together and coming, somehow, full circle over and over before flowing through my hands and joining the imprint of the 5th dimension and the infinite parallel universes which now sits in front of me as I write this. I thought to myself &quot;Jesus, this is how dreaded hippies and festival folk are born.&quot;<br /><br />After I put on the pendant, I tied a couple of knots, but accidentally reversed the spiral pattern. As it seemed to me, the doors of my perception had not only been flung wide open; they were straining at the hinges. I decided I couldn&#039;t untie the knots and fix it, and resolved to wander for a bit. I put the arts and crafts away and attempted to find the people I knew. Big. mistake. The universe in which I exist, have a name and a place and a life, was very unhappy that the thread connecting it to hyperspace was reversed. Electrons could not pair spin-up spin-down, and orbitals ceased to have their space-filling, 3 dimensional nature as the connection to all other parallel universes and possible quantum states faltered. I hurriedly found a new spot in the grass, not 15 feet from a juice bar (go figure), and set to the task of fixing my universe. I held on tightly to the last few kernels of myself; my name, where I grew up, where I live, what I&#039;m doing with my life.A few conversations were had, another necklace given away (one girl asked if was making the necklace to sell, but at this point it had become deeply personal, and I had already given away my spare). However, these conversations were usually cut short as I attempted to explain why it was so bloody important that I fix the universe in my hands, while chemical bonds around me began to split apart.&nbsp; As I finished, I lay back for a minute and breathed a deep sigh of relief. Don&#039;t thank me; for all I know we each exist in our own universe. Then the miracle of life is that scattered along the 5th dimension we are able to find each others&#039; place, though we do not perceive the journey.<br /><br />Whew. I needed to get out of the crowd and breathe. As I wandered, a bumped into a couple guys looking for MDMA, so I offered them my spare bag, which I like bring specifically for sharing. They were a little astonished I offered it to them freely, until I explained that I was tripping, it was a music festival, and I had 0.5g of MDA that had been set aside for sharing with the friends I had hoped to find, and all I asked was that they join me in taking it. Still not perceiving the passage of time, I recall that the sun was beginning to go down, and I would guess 7:30 PM or so at this point. I put out about half the bag, and we split it 3 ways, so roughly 150-175 mg. I would have done less, but have only just repaired my universe, my connection to the tangible world was sketchy at best. We joined up with their friends, wandered, wasn&#039;t digging the only stage playing music at that point, so they brought me to the electric forest (I don&#039;t remember exactly what it was called, but it comes highly recommended). Soft mulch underfoot, trees to sit on, i centered myself for a bit before rejoining the crew. The combination of that 15 minutes or so by myself in the dirt, having found a group of good people, and DReaMensioN&#039;s wonderful little taste of heaven focused and gave me a direction I had lacked since I walked in the gates. My subconscious refocused the mental energy that had been spilling over in nearly boundless creativity earlier in the day into a feeling of complete empathy and connection with the world around me. However, I still found myself fairly quiet, a combination of a lack of longtime friends around me, and not having had the chance to do yoga or meditate, and thus not being able to find the words to describe my surroundings. I wanted to share what I had discovered about the universe, but still could not find the words (I&#039;ve been struggling with them while writing this). But there was no anxiety about my lack of words; this was a perfect space, both in tangible surroundings and cosmic existence.<br /><br />Then the energy began to come, as Tom Petty&#039;s set reached a climax and the sound danced it&#039;s way through the forest to us. My arms began to dance. My feet, having had a chance to recuperate, began to twirl if I sat; my head and hips joined the whirl if I stood. Wave after wave came, not crashing into me or hitting me, but flowing into me from the surroundings and back out in the form of smiles and positive vibrations echoed forth from my very soul. We headed to the late night show (Big Gigantic) a few minutes after 12, and the getting down commenced as we made our way to a good space. Not having eaten all day, I couldn&#039;t keep a consistent dance flow all the way through, all though that saxophone was impossible not to dance to, the ground was soft, the space just right, and the set an absolute killer.<br /><br />Wandering away from the show, I did my part to keep the grounds a bit cleaner as we walked. Every time I got a little lost, this group of nearly complete friends-not-yet-met-before-in-this-life made sure I didn&#039;t actually get lost, reaffirming my faith in humanity. We got back to a campsite around 2 AM and smoked a bowl, which got me going again; yeah, 11 hours and still going strong. There we met their friend, who was the festival troll, having already convinced a good portion of the festival the day before that the headliner (Red Hot Chili Peppers) for the day had canceled, to be replaced by Phil Collins and Genesis, and proceeded to convince people that Passion Pit had also canceled. The way the festival was set up, with big acts were the only ones playing at a time, so I found it hilarious and fascinating that these echoes he was putting out into the crowd were making their way through the festival and cropping up again. We walked to the other campsite, got ice cream, the early morning birds produced impressive auditory hallucinations, and we smoked until 3:30 AM, bowls, a MacGyvered bong, and a hash oil pen. That combination brought on another wave of the doses and the MDA that lasted until about 4:30 AM, although visual hallucinations were greatly diminished, and mostly restricted to the MDA sort; the bright, pretty lights. Auditory hallucinations were also diminished, but still present as I walked around, dancing ensuing while music was present from another groups&#039; car. I attempted a bit of yoga, but the dew beginning to collected bothered me a bit (no mat) and my flow was unsteady. Strangely, my hand balance posture was fairly solid, while my foot balance was off. Anyway,I went to sleep in the back seat of this girl&#039;s car with a lovely woven wool blanket to keep me comfortable, having had my faith in mankind once more renewed.<br /><br />I woke up around 7:30, walked, relaxed for another 45 minutes, and said my farewells before headed home, showering, meditating a bit, and sitting down to write this report out and put words to that which I could not the night before while listening to used copies of Santana&#039;s live double LP &quot;Moonflower&quot; and Stevie Wonder&#039;s &quot;Songs in the Key of Life,&quot; drinking a beer, and completing the process of fully digesting such a transformative experience, gently closing the doors of perception, and reentering the real world. <br /><br />On a personal note, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be taking two of these tabs again. I feel like with proper preparation, one is sufficient for me to fully open the doors.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to stick around and putting up with my stream of consciousness moments. As I&#039;m sure many will understand, punctuation does not come naturally to the detailed explanation of that which exists in between worlds. Many thanks to DReaMensioN and whoever the skilled chemist is who makes that fluff. I will never be using another vendor on silkroad, and those who are wondering, and those who ask me, will find that he/she/they comes with the highest recommendations.<br /><br />Peace, Love, and Good Vibrations. Send your echoes out there and they will return to you, in one form or another.

				Me my gf and 3 other friends split 1G of DReaMensioN&#039;s oldschool amber MDMA at an eletronic show last weekend. had a&nbsp; great time.<br /><br />We&#039;re all pretty experienced with good quality MDMA, <br /><br />I weighed out 4 x 160MG <br />And 4x 100 MG<br /><br />We went out to the show and 4 of us did the 160 MG parachutes, about a hour later my gf was really high and expressing her love for me and our lovely new home :) One of my good mates had quite a bit to drink and instantly blacked out after taking the parachute(pretty common from my experience from mixing good MDMA + alot of alchohol) and I saw him a hour later on the dance floor sweating his ass off rolling like crazy :p<br /><br />It took roughly 1Hour- 1.5 hour to completely hit me from a parachute and later in the night I redosed another 100mg, My gf and one buddy(not quite as experienced)&nbsp; couldn&#039;t do any more than just the 160mg. <br /><br />Over all I had a great night and the M kindof helped me and my girl get a bit closer which is always good :)<br /><br />THANKS DREAM! <br />after reading the great reviews on his LSD I think ill save it for a music festival im heading to at the end of July and me and my girl will take 1 tab each there and explore the universe ;)<br /><br />CHEERS

				Not to burst your bubble bukket, but I have seen a lot of people freak out and not have a good time taking L for the first time at a festival, or for that matter in any situation where they are around a lot of people. Many of them were couples. In fact, during my trip, that was exactly what happened to one of the couples I hung with at the festival.<br /><br />If she&#039;s never taken it before (or you for that matter), DON&#039;T let either of you do it at a festival for the first time. Especially strong L like DReaMensioN sells.<br /><br />Honestly, although I was able to have an incredible experience, it was stupid, really stupid, of me to take that much, of that good acid, in that situation, without having first met my friends. Rereading my trip report now I&#039;m not sure I made it clear how scary it was at one point. I was literally holding onto nothing but my name. The 2 things that saved me were the fact that I have taken L before, both with friends and at a festival (although never that much, and never that quality), and had some idea of what was happening and how to direct Lucy&#039;s energy (or at least nudge her in a different direction), and the fact that having &quot;overcome&quot; depression, a decade-or-so-long mild dysthymia marked by 2 major depressive episodes, I have a good deal of mental fortitude and an ability to block and/or work through negative thoughts and thinking patterns. Also, in a roundabout sort of way, without any friends (or girlfriend) to root me to a particular place or pattern (mental loops are a dangerous thing if you don&#039;t know how to spot them), which I may have found had negative energy, I was free to let the universe push me to a good place. <br /><br />My first trip was a beautiful spring day. I tripped with 2 other (experience) buddies, we spent the day hanging out and doing various bullshit with all of our close college friends (several of whom had tripped before), spent a lot of time outside, and went to the art show. That is a good first trip. A dirty crowded festival full of potentially bad energy is not a good place for a first trip. Believe me, this is not the Woodstock era, and as many good people as there are out there, there are many who will send you bad energy. <br /><br />Please take my advice on this one; You do not want to break yourself down to nothing but a name for the first time at a music festival.

				Thanks alot for the advice and I truly appreciate it theykilledkilla, <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m super experienced with LSD, considering I&#039;ve only done it 2x so far, <br /><br />Both times I dosed, I took only 1 tab. <br /><br />The first experience was in the City with a friend and his girlfriend, I don&#039;t think this stuff was too potent, I had the laughs like crazy but not much of any hallucinations what so ever. my mate wasn&#039;t being very sociable which was kindof tuff for me being the first time I had ever dropped. All in all it was an OK day, I wouldnt say it was great or anything though.<br /><br />The second experience was at quite possibly the most out of control music festival in the world, with tons of freaks dressed up in all sorts (Some actually scary looking even sober lol) So at about 12 Noon we were walking around when a guy with a Boa(snake) wrapped around his neck sold us the tabs, <br /><br />These tabs were great quality(so said my friends and brother who have all been doing LSD for years)<br />I did 1 and it blew my first trip out of the water, I have a great group of festival friends who are alot of fun and we all dosed together, walking around laughing our asses off, hanging out at the beach, very mild visuals but that was ok because this was probaly the MOST fun i&#039;ve ever had at a festival( and ive been to aLOT) <br /><br />My girlfriend has not ever tried Lucy before, but her mind is open and she&#039;s ready to try the real deal.|<br /><br />I&#039;ve experience &quot;the fear&quot; from hallucinogenic substances before(several times with Magic Mushrooms) For some reason when using shrooms I always go over the top, and it honestly sucks being in that spot, at the same music festival a few years ago I did about 5G and I was having the worst life thoughts and just wanted out!!&nbsp; haha, that being said I will never OVERDOSE with hallucinogenic substances again! :p I wil<br /><br />I will take only 1 tab, and starting early in the morning with a huge group of buddies who will also be dosing.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up though, I&#039;m going to have my girl start on just a half a tab since shes a big smaller than me.<br />

				Forgot to mention in my last post, this year I won&#039;t be going to the crazy festival as I mentioned in the above post, I&#039;ve been to this festival a few years back and it was super chill and great vibes, most like minded people ope atleast open minded. <br /><br />Im sure everything will be alright, But I appreciate you&#039;re concern. <br /><br />I would never DREAM(no pun intended heh) of taking 2 tabs at once. after my bad experiences with over dosing with mushrooms, Ill stick to only doing 1 tab probally for the rest of my days(I only use hallucinogenic&#039;s once every few years)

				That sounds like a plan. It&#039;s good that it&#039;s a more laid back festival. Honestly with the Shiva&#039;s if she&#039;s never taken L before, or hallucinogens in general, she&#039;d probably be fine with a half a tab. I&#039;d also keep some molly or sass around; not only is candy flipping possibly the closest one can get to heaven on Earth, I also found it really focused my trip and kept my mind from wandering off into the sunset.<br /><br />An experienced friend once told me that shrooms are a masculine spirit, and LSD is a feminine spirit. Shrooms grab hold of your soul and say &quot;HEY YOU. LOOK AT THIS,&quot; and it&#039;s much more difficult to keep some semblance of control. But Lucy takes you by the hand and says &quot;Hey. You. Come walk with me a bit and see what I have to show you.&quot; I&#039;d amend that to say that Lucy will show you things, things about the inner workings of the universe beyond our ordinary layers of perception. But in return, you have to show her something. It might just be a good time with your friends and all your crazy inside jokes. But if you don&#039;t show her something, she can take off running through the corridors of your mind, and if you don&#039;t catch her in time, she&#039;ll run through all the darkest corners and dig up your deepest secrets and repressed fears about yourself.<br /><br />Either way, you&#039;ll discover something new about yourself, the Universe, and your place within it. Happy trails bukket, and I hope the good vibes follow you and your gf on your adventure!

				What country are shipments coming from? It seems as though some reviews are saying its not US-US although that&#039;s what most of your listings are advertised as that. I&#039;d like to try some of this MDMA but I want to confirm that it will indeed be domestic.

				I took two of the shivas at waka and tripped insane balls. They actually weren&#039;t from draemension but we&#039;re the same exact blotter art and possibly microgram dosage. It was a life changing experience to say the least. I look forward to getting to try it again

				Just a few questions and concerns here. isn&#039;t impossible to get MDMA to a purity higher then ~85%? I thought the rest of the MDMA was MDMA-HCL and there wasn&#039;t anything you could do about it. I&#039;m not an MDMA expert by any means but still that raised a few flags for me. also which of his MDMA did you guys enjoy more? what are the differences between the rolls?

				Both of these MDMA batches, amber and white are 90-100% and 92-100% MDMA Hcl, respectfully, basically meaning absolutely pure and uncut, it just gets very hard to pinpoint exact number when it gets above 90% purity<br /><br />You should definitely get the Shiva LSD from me while it is still available,<br />I also have gotten a completely FRESH LSD Batch in now, the Legendary Indigo HUNABKUS,<br />many find it more visual and enjoy these even more than Shivas, plus it is as fresh as it gets !<br /><br />Read my profile, Domestic encompasses both USA and Canada, and everything else being International<br />&nbsp;and your order will get shipped from from the outpost with the best stock currently in regards to your order placed,<br />We both use basically the SAME MAILING SYSTEM, and Millions of ordinary mail cross in and out per day, bypassing everything customs can possibly throw in them, and always going around it completely, it is the increased activity towards SR in certain States that creates the challenge, and it DOES NOT MATTER then Where in the world your mail comes from !<br /><br />But for harder to reach states, I protect it from any kind of possible interceptions or even reason to open it and x-ray or K9 anything out of it until the cows come home<br />Rest assured that you are in Very Good hands, and everything relating to shipping around the world, and especially to Canada and USA has been Very well thought through to perfection !<br /><br />We spent over 2-3 YEARS on simply staying up-to-date with the current shipping stealth techniques and designing the packages for You :)<br /><br />Please Believe in Me,<br />cause what I need is for you to Believe in Me<br /><br />See you wonderful beings in SR !<br /><br />Peace, Love and Harmony &lt;3

				DReaMensioN:<br /><br />I took the sample (110mg) at 22h, after a relaxed day driving around. <br />2 days ago I had a micro-dose of mescaline (8mg). <br /><br />We waited 2h after dinner before taking the MDMA and in the meanwhile we had a few beers. <br /><br />15m after swallowing the parachute I can feel the very first wave of warmth going from my belly to my brain. Just 1 small, lonesome wave - but I know now more will come ;)<br /><br />1h I can feel more and more of the MDMA in my body, my mind (? and my soul?)<br /><br />We&#039;re just over 1h in the sample and I get the &quot;MDMA confusion&quot; very hard… nice, because you go with the flow without worrying about whatsoever...<br /><br />During the up-come of MDMA often you&#039;ll feel tired, or sometimes a bit paranoid, but with this MDMA i just feel very &quot;uplifted&quot;… I can feel the &quot;zoom&quot; in my ears (very clear sign of a rapid come-up) but not the fatigue or paranoia that I sometimes have… <br />It does come up strong after 1h. I measured about 1.7mg/body kg and thus I took 110mg (just 10mg less than what I would usually take), but I don&#039;t think the experience will be any less intense because of those 10mg… <br /><br />About 1.5h: the hart rate start to go up a bit, the &quot;confusion&quot; seems to be ebbing away, still quite a &quot;zoom&quot; in the ears - but that&#039;s totally normal for me when I take pure and good MDMA. <br /><br />We&#039;re home alone, with some nice psychedelic music and (this is quite rare for me) I feel the urge to actually dance (while being on MDMA)… nice and totally unexpected..!<br /><br />2h in the experience - no doubt about it; this is first class MDMA. A bit &quot;lighter&quot; and more &quot;uplifting&quot; than most other MDMA&#039;s I&#039;ve tried (but I also took 10mg less than my normal dose)… <br />Anyway: I&#039;ve sampled this product and now, without any doubt, I can recommend DReaMensioN&#039;s MDMA. <br />He&#039;s a nice guy, with a good service and very quick packaging&amp;shipping. His stealth is inventive and his product is top-notch..<br /><br />Now we&#039;re gone take some 2C-B and stop writing about the sample :D sorry for that, but &quot;life must go on&quot;...<br /><br />The 2C-B hasn&#039;t started working yet…but I can really tell you this: I&quot;m totally enjoying my ride in MDMA-county. This is not the &quot;hardest&quot; MDMA that you can buy on the Road, nor the most intense, but it is one that will bring you a VERY clean high…

				Took me an hour and a half to read this whole thread. At first I was amazed at some of the incredible descriptions of trips taken by posters. Then something said to me, &#039;hmmmmm, too good to be true?<br />Sure nuff, by last page of posts, several people are expressing frustration with vendor&#039;s silence and possible disappearance.<br />Will be interesting how this thread goes over next week or so.<br />I&#039;m rooting for those of you who are patiently waiting for your orders to come in. If all turns out fine, I&#039;m gonna jump in and try DReaMensionN wares myself.

				There&#039;s an update on his vendor page, he hasn&#039;t completely disappeared. <br /><br />Kind of a funny story.&nbsp; There&#039;s really one forum member who does most of the enthusiastic reviews, although he&#039;s been around a while and gives good reviews to other vendors as well. IIRC dreamension merited mention on one of the avenger threads.&nbsp; Interesting case, jury still out imo

				My last order with dream did take quite a bit longer than the first couple, I think it was due either to 4th of july issues or the DMT snafu. Either way, I count myself lucky that it actually arrived in time for my last festival, after reading some of these reports of the last couple weeks of shipments.<br /><br />Hopefully DReam stays awesome, because those Hunabku tabs are so incredibly clean, I don&#039;t think I ever want to take a different tab again.<br />Onset was sneaky, and within about 10 minutes of realizing that they were kicking in I felt like I was taking off. I didn&#039;t feel like I wasn&#039;t still coming up for at least 6 or 7 hours, by which time there wasn&#039;t a plateau; just a really long, slow, and gradual return to baseline, with a few smaller &quot;peaks&quot; lasting up to 30 minutes after smoking a bit of weed. T+14 hours I was still talking to the spirits channelling through the trees; well, one tree in particular. <br /><br />In the words of my tripping buddy (he&#039;s got about 100 or so under his belt, compared to my half-dozen or so), &quot;My ankles are fucked, the tendonitis in my knees is killing me, my back is fucked, my neck has a grapefruit sized bruise and my tooth is cracked in half, and it was the best day of my life!&quot; <br /><br />Seriously, he said that about 20 times the rest of the weekend<br />Stay cool DreaM.

				I&#039;ve done business with Dream before and I know first hand he is a top notch vendor. This is the drug trade we are talking about and things like this come up. Anybody whose bought drugs from the streets knows that this business can be sporadic at best. I think he just had a lot of business to catch up on which has caused him to sacrifice the great customer service he is so well known for. This is just a glitch and I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll back up to his excellent standards in no time.

				My order would&#039;ve auto-finalized in two days if I did nothing and since I have not received my orders nor a reply from two different messages three days ago...so I requested a full refund through a resolution.

Now...I&#039;ve had no reply to my pm&#039;s and nor to the resolution request I submitted yesterday for my two orders from Dreamension. It seems a few people in his reviews have had similar issues.

				Hello dear friends !<br /><br />We have experienced a slight hick-up in operations in the last week, and I see that some of you have begun to worry<br /><br />Rest assured, I wanted to notify you as soon as possible and I will make it up to all of you with a gigantic extra bonus included at no extra cost in every package that was delayed :)<br /><br />It has been all cleared up now<br />&nbsp;<br />Sincere apologies,<br />This issue has been thoroughly documented and will not re-occur again<br /><br />I have tried to send personal PMs to many of you and still do with detailed info, but not ALL of them have reached the destination because SR takes about 2-3mins for me to send a reply through<br />and half the time I get re-directed to LOGIN page again where I have to login again and wait about 5mins just to get in and then it keeps on repeating this until I shut down the whole Tor browser and restart...<br /><br />See you back on SR, there is absolutely no need to worry,<br />I work on improving the logistics and inventory all the time and I plan on being here for many years to come while keeping it as cool as possible !<br /><br />Love and Harmony &lt;3<br /><br /><br />PS. Keep this On Topic, ALL Other inquires besides Trip Reports should be directed to my SR INBOX<br /><br />Thank you

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am curious as to why you do not reply to my messages and why you explained what I have copy and pasted below to me 10 days ago and now I am being told the same thing and to wait 10 days again? Can I get tracking information this time? I have about 4 hours to decide if I would like to extend my due date an additional 10 days. In the meantime you can pm me and I will reply promptly.<br /><br />Dreamension: &quot;Greetings friend !<br /><br />I have just officially returned to the &quot;Online&quot; bit of SR after resolving internal issues AND working on the Orders that were still in queue from before the temporary Pause<br /><br />It seems that your order has been one of to be caught into the whirlwind of chaos which was caused by our shipper leaving to help out with set-up of a festival a week ago and leaving myself to work on the orders still to go personally,<br />some orders were accidentally marked shipped before going on, and some were already pacakged but were not yet picked-up,<br />which was part of the reason for slight slow down in operations, and I did not have a second to reply to any PMs because it is a full-time work for me once I begin and I also had a BTC Exchange problem to deal with on the side which did not even allow me to turn Anything around for re-stock,<br /><br />It has been all cleared up now<br /><br />I tried to focus on completing all the orders first and resolving any last bits before I re-open for normal business and begin answering all the PMs<br /><br />Your order has been shipped out at the end of last week, instead of the end of the week previous, and I have included a gigantic extra bonus of product for you to balance it out<br /><br />This issue has been thoroughly documented and will not re-occur again<br /><br />Sincere apologies for this minor delay,<br />rest assured, I wanted to notify you as soon as possible and I will make it up to you so that both of us are happy<br /><br />Please expect the shipment to arrive in around 7 days from now to be safe :)<br /><br />Blessings &lt;3&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed1310 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 second<br />July 26, 2013, 10:57 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked into and double checked your order personally,<br />your shipment has been upgraded to 150% of your original order Plus a generous bonus of my ultimate LSD has been included in it for absolutely free<br /><br />also we know have exact ETA for the arrival of your package, and it is being near the end of next week<br /><br />I have finally managed to get everything under control and will dedicate 24/7 of my time to SR again, plus will be bringing full and improved inventory back on the menu,<br />this peak of Summer has been extremely hard to deal with everything due to scorching heatwave and commitment to organization of many major Musical Festivals<br /><br />Blessings &lt;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />DReaMensioN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 hours<br />July 26, 2013, 3:47 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept<br /><br /><br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel after trying to receive my two orders from Dreamension and waiting twice it is safe to say that if I do not receive my two orders by the due date of my extension that I would most likely never receive any orders I place with Dreamension. I have waited a very long time for an order which is advertised as Domestic which from what I read in the comments is not shipped Domestically as advertised. I have received very little communication and very poor response times to 1 out of three messages which has been replied to and my resolution requests. One of the reasons I place my orders with Dreamension was lightning fast answers to my various questions prior to placing my orders. I don&#039;t order internationally because I feel much more secure and have much more peace of mind when I place my orders from SR Domestically and I receive my orders very fast. I have never waited more than just a few days for a Domestic order and I have received every single order I placed Domestically. Honestly I am disappointing that I waited patiently twice and still after so much time has passed I still have not received my orders. Even Internationally...one out of two tries should be successful. I would like to request a full refund if I have not received my orders by the due date of my extensions.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Sealed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sealed1310 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 hours<br />July 26, 2013, 1:08 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reviewing your order and extending the due date<br />I will contact you personally via PM with more info statim &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />DReaMensioN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days<br />July 16, 2013, 6:37 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old<br /><br /><br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am open to a full refund or free reship of the products I ordered.

				It gives me no pleasure to do this but I have been given little option and I see by this forum that I am not alone with my issues. I&#039;m posting here only because I have PM&#039;d&nbsp; DReaM and received no reply and messages have not been read. <br /><br />First order went like a dream, great communication sorting out order, to build trust I even FE though I wasn&#039;t asked and this I never do unless no option. Package arrived in good time and product exactly as described, couldn&#039;t have gone better. Placed second order anticipating the same, good communication setting order up as before, this time I didn&#039;t FE straight away thought bit of give and take, no package after 17 days but this is not unusual and I had faith in DReaM so I decided not to tie their coins up too long, FE.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Yes I know loads of people say never FE but sometimes you just have to trust people and show trust. And sometimes in some parts of the globe you have no choice with loads of vendors. Messaged to inform of intentions, 10 days later no package and message not read so thought it was about time to message again, left another day no reply and none of the messages read. Hmm check out their forum and see that quite a few people saying the same thing, not good.<br /><br />Left it three more days to give the benefit of doubt , still no reply so here I am. I do believe these are good people but this is no way to run a business no matter what the product. A month later no package, no message. How simple is it to message if there is a problem, people will show patience if they are kept in the loop. <br /><br />Come on DReaM this is not good for your business, things can get hectic but as all people who run their own business know you dig deep and get stuck in. You shouldn&#039;t be taking on new orders if you have no time to deal with old orders. <br /><br />I will edit this if it gets sorted, as I have said I do feel these are good people but at the moment there are some real issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Do no trust this Vendor. I repeat, Do Not Trust This Vendor. They have ongoing issues with missing orders or packages. Just enough not to arise suspicion. However, If you examine their buyer feedback area; Every page will have at least one claim of a package or order not arriving. These missing orders go well beyond July. A trend I haven&#039;t seen on any other vendor feedback on SR. Quality of product and stealth of shipping methods maybe called into question, but I haven&#039;t seen any Vendors with soo many missing packages.<br /><br />Most buyers say they received a PM from the vendor about the issue, but then nothing more and no package arrives. I received a beautiful worded PM that tried to convince me they had documented the issue, gave me a bonus for my trouble, and sent out my packaged. I almost hit finalize, but I thought better and hit resolution. I extend the due date to the arrival day the vendor claimed was &quot;safe&quot;.<br /><br />Still no package.&nbsp; Now DreamMension claimed yet another shipping error on their end and it would be arriving the following week.<br />I sent them a PM in return saying I wasn&#039;t interested in them re-send it out, and to simply refund my money. I asked for a 100% refund after paying for the vendor&#039;s more expensive &quot;safe&quot; shipping method.<br /><br />They disregarded everything I, the customer, said and did not refund my money. I&#039;m now tied up in another week plus waiting for a package that likely won&#039;t come. My advice, STAY AWAY from this Vendor or ANY Vendor with missing packages in their feedback. Just not worth it...

				Actually, I look for negative reviews, shows the vendor (probably) didn&#039;t make up his own reviews.&nbsp; However, it is clear that Dreamension needs to unfuck this situation before he can claim business as usual.&nbsp; I wish him the best, seems like a nice guy and all.&nbsp;

				I know this doesnt make up for anything that DReaM&#039;s been doing. and if this is whats happening he really should be telling the people who are ordering from him.. or atleast take his listings down while he cant be taking care of orders.<br /><br />Im from very close to DReaM and he mentions above that hes been busy with music festivals, at this time in the area close to DReaM there is a loop of 3 big hippie festivals back to back, Maybe with a day or 2 maximum inbetween, so if he is indeed out at these festivals I really doubt he will&nbsp; be seen online in the next week or 2.<br /><br /><br />That being said I just returned from one of these festivals where I got into some of DReaM&#039;s HunabKu&#039;s and I can confirm they are the same quality if not stronger than the Hunab&#039;s which were going around about 5 years ago.<br /><br />For anyone looking for the same quality LSD; Remotekontrol has the Hunab&#039;s and Luke Brown&#039;s(IMO a bit stronger than the all-seeing shivas)&nbsp; for cheaper, the exact same quality and ALOT better customer service. <br /><br />Enjoy guys I hope you all get your reships like I did!!( I did appreciate my bonus, 2 hits but I wouldnt consider that to be a HUGE BONUS)

				Yeah, something&#039;s up all right...and no, I don&#039;t think I missed a package that I knew was going to look like junk mail after spending 2+ btc on the order. Plus, Too many others are reporting missing packages within the same time span.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad some of you manage to get product from this vendor, but there are countless missing package reports throughout the vendor feedback area. Many of which well before this supposed recent personal July issue. It seemed like every other order went missing or did not arrive, however a fair amount of them did. So whatever the problem it got much worse as of late. During my&nbsp; vendor browsing, I have yet to see a vendor with soo many missing orders.<br /><br />I also got the impression the vendor did not react well to a disgruntle customer, and turtle behind these bulk emails hoping the PMs would convince them to finalize instead of going for a resolution. I know I was tempted to hit finalize at first on good faith after their first PM to me was filled with kind words, reasonable excuses, promises of extra product for my time, etc.<br /><br />Probably won&#039;t matter now if they&#039;ve pulled all their active listings. It&#039;s probably for best if their having soo many personal and professional issues. <br />

				&nbsp;:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(EVERYONE PLEASE READ IF YOU GET YOUR ORDER DO NOT FINALIZE UNTIL YOU&#039;VE TRIED THE PRODUCT****<br /><br />I ordered LSD-25 Indigo HUNABKU 150mcg (4x) on June 27th and marked shipped on June 30th. Received 6 Tabs on 8/2 seller claimed the extra 150% he was adding was going to be the better shit but at last, it all in one big rectangle I had to cut into the squares. We dosed at 11am on Saturday the 8/3. I am so f*cking glad I did not release payment after I saw it come. He asked for 10 more days 11 hours ago and if he had read his message inbox before that he would&#039;ve seen this message I sent him. So far, I have had my coins in escrow with DReaMensioN for thirty-five (35) days. Honestly, It shouldn&#039;t be allowed for a order to be in escrow for that long and have staff comment once on a reship and just accept all of his 10 day extensions so he has enough time for product to go out and people to finalize so he can get out of here because the 2 tabs of <br /><br />(Here&#039;s the last message I sent to DreaMensioN last night)<br />Hey so your tabs showed up and none of them worked. I ate one waited an hour nothing, another waited an hour nothing and a third, my lightweight ~120 girlfriend who trips balls off of ~80mcg acid said she felt it but as much as she does when we makeout after i eat a tab for like 5 minutes so....the last 2 tabs went to Ehrlich&#039;s tests and so I put a small piece of one blotter into the vial with the liquid. I suspected the tabs weren&#039;t LSD (due to unpreforation, bitter taste and it affected us different than I would expect from LSD). After the blotter was in the liquid I took the wick out, look and it was defiantly not turning purple anytime soon and submerged it and it sucked up almost all the liquid. the wick changed to a light yellow color but that was about it. Since it was a 1 time only test kit, I squeezed the wick to try to put some of the liquid back into the vial and it was definitely yellow. No way it&#039;s acid. If you wanna go ahead and refund me 100% i&#039;ll say i got great acid and ill praise you like a good at this point. It&#039;s been a month waiting and im half an hour late because I needed to type this out now. Just do the right thing and cut your losses. Thanks and hopefully this is the last message like this I&#039;ll have to send.<br /><br /><br />(Last message I sent in my resolution, still haven&#039;t released payments and he keeps asking for max time each time)<br />&nbsp; Product had already arrived, it is unpreforated tabs that are not real acid. I did a 3 of them at a time and barely felt anything. I felt like it was a weak research chemical and my friends who trip off half a tab of street ~100mcg acid took two each and they felt nothing at all. The paper also tasted like blank paper with a faint aftertaste of one of the NBOMe series. This entire order is ridiculous. If I have to wait 10 more days or they believe you again (even though at least 10 other people on the community forums are saying the same)&nbsp; I will personally spend all my time making sure no one will ever buy from you again. I am letting you keep 10% because I pity you. You sold a false product and was a month late on supplying it. So you lied to the customer in two ways. Accept this offer or your feedback and forums will definitely take a blow. If he still is pushing for more time on all his clients then he must be waiting for these orders in resolution to finish so he can get out of here quick. Dealers that take a month to deliver a product that shouldn&#039;t have taken more then a week. Also, only 1 vacuum seal instead of three like you advertise. Maybe it was real acid and your inability to properly store, ship and protect your merchandise is what broke 4 of out 6 of them. One has been tested and came up yellow on an Ehrlich&#039;s regent test. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Staff- There are 5 topics in the forums totaling 11 pages all about DReaMensioN and buyers like me who he is ripping off. Do not let him wait any longer because he&#039;s sending out fake tabs and once people get them, they&#039;ll finalize before trying anything and he&#039;ll have made so much money with just this ripoff scheme, seems like he has at least 15 people in resolution and once these fake tabs come on Monday and people start to finalize i guarantee he&#039;ll be gone.<br /><br />P.S.- Yes, I know I am copy pasta this on all of his threads but I hope that atleast one person will not just finilize when they see the letter. SPREAD THE WORD AND DON&#039;T LET SELLERS LIKE THIS BUILD UP REP FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AND THEN HAVE A MONTHS WORTH OF ORDERS TO ARRIVE ALL AT ONCE, LATER THEN EXPECTED CAUSING EVERYONE TO JUST RELEASE PAYMENT AND SIT BACK IN THE GLORY THAT AFTER A 2 or 3 or 4 or 5! WEEK TRIP ITS HERE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY AND ENDED UP HAVING TO REFUND ALL THE TABS DUE TO THEM BEING BLANK OR NOT ACID. Enough of my rant, hopefully f*cking staff will catch on before he makes off with a bunch of coins from orders he sold blank/fake tabs. Buy a test kit from amazon, its cheap, you get 10 tests and its really easy way to tell if your getting acid or not....Thanks and lets bring down this MOTHERF*CKER!!!!<br /><br />~skrill3xx/onlyAJJ/AndrewJacksonJihad/skrill3x

So your assurance of a &quot;200% reship&quot; does not interest me, nor do I find it believable in any way. Until I happen to wander out to the drop box and just happen to see your little amber rocks in some mail, that feedback will remain, and your business on this site will continue to be a nightmare for you. You can&#039;t black-list the amount of buyers you have ripped off. There is so much resolution activity going on because of you it isn&#039;t funny. It&#039;s just strange that the staff haven&#039;t acted on this yet.<br /><br />

Sweet....&quot; THAT would assure me that you indeed sent a bonus to make up for the mistake of one of your crew members, and also going online and seeing that all the other angry and cheated buyers in fact received their orders with fat bonuses and are all happy and apologetic for not trusting you.<br /><br />None of this has happened. So your assurance of a &quot;200% reship&quot; does not interest me, nor do I find it believable in any way. Until I happen to wander out to the drop box and just happen to see your little amber rocks in some mail, that feedback will remain, and your business on this site will continue to be a nightmare for you. You can&#039;t black-list the amount of buyers you have ripped off. There is so much resolution activity going on because of you it isn&#039;t funny. It&#039;s just strange that the staff haven&#039;t acted on this yet.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Your experience is not aberrant.&nbsp; I received a very similar message --- you can tell dreamension has gotten a bit snarky of late -- at the outset (3-4 mo ago) she seemed, humble, helpful and genuine -- i&#039;m not sure if she&#039;s gotten in over her head or what but the inconsistencies alone are disconcerting -- I hope that dreamension is able to salvage her reputation and right whatever wrongs that may have transpired<br /><br />few mistakes are irrevocable&nbsp; - I think that if this vendor behaves in an honest and sincere fashion from her on out - she may be able to prosper on the road<br /><br />for now&nbsp; -&nbsp; to all you prospective buyers, proceed with caution until those 1 feedback ratings are addressed<br /><br />PS let this be yet another lesson to employ the escrow system - it keeps buyers and sellers on even footing

Received 6 Tabs on 8/2 seller claimed the extra 150% he was adding was going to be the better shit but at last, it all in one big rectangle I had to cut into the squares. We dosed at 11am on Saturday the 8/3. I am so f*cking glad I did not release payment after I saw it come. He asked for 10 more days 11 hours ago and if he had read his message inbox before that he would&#039;ve seen this message I sent him. So far, I have had my coins in escrow with DReaMensioN for thirty-five (35) days. Honestly, It shouldn&#039;t be allowed for a order to be in escrow for that long and have staff comment once on a reship and just accept all of his 10 day extensions so he has enough time for product to go out and people to finalize so he can get out of here because the 2 tabs of <br /><br />(Here&#039;s the last message I sent to DreaMensioN last night)<br />Hey so your tabs showed up and none of them worked. I ate one waited an hour nothing, another waited an hour nothing and a third, my lightweight ~120 girlfriend who trips balls off of ~80mcg acid said she felt it but as much as she does when we makeout after i eat a tab for like 5 minutes so....the last 2 tabs went to Ehrlich&#039;s tests and so I put a small piece of one blotter into the vial with the liquid. I suspected the tabs weren&#039;t LSD (due to unpreforation, bitter taste and it affected us different than I would expect from LSD). After the blotter was in the liquid I took the wick out, look and it was defiantly not turning purple anytime soon and submerged it and it sucked up almost all the liquid. the wick changed to a light yellow color but that was about it. Since it was a 1 time only test kit, I squeezed the wick to try to put some of the liquid back into the vial and it was definitely yellow. No way it&#039;s acid. If you wanna go ahead and refund me 100% i&#039;ll say i got great acid and ill praise you like a good at this point. It&#039;s been a month waiting and im half an hour late because I needed to type this out now. Just do the right thing and cut your losses. Thanks and hopefully this is the last message like this I&#039;ll have to send.<br /><br /><br />(Last message I sent in my resolution, still haven&#039;t released payments and he keeps asking for max time each time)<br />&nbsp; Product had already arrived, it is unpreforated tabs that are not real acid. I did a 3 of them at a time and barely felt anything. I felt like it was a weak research chemical and my friends who trip off half a tab of street ~100mcg acid took two each and they felt nothing at all. The paper also tasted like blank paper with a faint aftertaste of one of the NBOMe series. This entire order is ridiculous. If I have to wait 10 more days or they believe you again (even though at least 10 other people on the community forums are saying the same)&nbsp; I will personally spend all my time making sure no one will ever buy from you again. I am letting you keep 10% because I pity you. You sold a false product and was a month late on supplying it. So you lied to the customer in two ways. Accept this offer or your feedback and forums will definitely take a blow. If he still is pushing for more time on all his clients then he must be waiting for these orders in resolution to finish so he can get out of here quick. Dealers that take a month to deliver a product that shouldn&#039;t have taken more then a week. Also, only 1 vacuum seal instead of three like you advertise. Maybe it was real acid and your inability to properly store, ship and protect your merchandise is what broke 4 of out 6 of them. One has been tested and came up yellow on an Ehrlich&#039;s regent test. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Staff- There are 5 topics in the forums totaling 11 pages all about DReaMensioN and buyers like me who he is ripping off. Do not let him wait any longer because he&#039;s sending out fake tabs and once people get them, they&#039;ll finalize before trying anything and he&#039;ll have made so much money with just this ripoff scheme, seems like he has at least 15 people in resolution and once these fake tabs come on Monday and people start to finalize i guarantee he&#039;ll be gone.<br /><br />P.S.- Yes, I know I am copy pasta this on all of his threads but I hope that atleast one person will not just finilize when they see the letter. SPREAD THE WORD AND DON&#039;T LET SELLERS LIKE THIS BUILD UP REP FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AND THEN HAVE A MONTHS WORTH OF ORDERS TO ARRIVE ALL AT ONCE, LATER THEN EXPECTED CAUSING EVERYONE TO JUST RELEASE PAYMENT AND SIT BACK IN THE GLORY THAT AFTER A 2 or 3 or 4 or 5! WEEK TRIP ITS HERE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY AND ENDED UP HAVING TO REFUND ALL THE TABS DUE TO THEM BEING BLANK OR NOT ACID. Enough of my rant, hopefully f*cking staff will catch on before he makes off with a bunch of coins from orders he sold blank/fake tabs. Buy a test kit from amazon, its cheap, you get 10 tests and its really easy way to tell if your getting acid or not....Thanks and lets bring down this MOTHERF*CKER!!!!<br /><br />~skrill3xx/onlyAJJ/AndrewJacksonJihad/skrill3x<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Weird.. These were the hunabs and Shivas?<br /><br />I did 1 hunab at a music festival a few weeks ago and tripped my balls off(felt as strong as the hunabs from a few years ago in Canada)<br />few days later did a shiva. and had great effects felts a bit stronger in the body but I didnt trip as hard( Could have been from doing only 1 after doing 1 a few days before )<br /><br />I&#039;ve done LSD about 50x and these tabs were forsure in the top 5. <br /><br />Hunabs were great visual from just 1 tab(Pretty rare for me.. usually need 3+ for anything visual)<br /><br /><br />No one should order from Dream though.. his prices are crazy... his customer service has went down the drain hard.. even if I did get 2 extra tabs on a 4 tab order.. I&#039;m not pleased with my order.. I waited a month and I&#039;m literally within a stones throw of Dream.<br /><br />remotekontrol has the hunabku&#039;s for half the price<br />trc has the shiva&#039;s for half the price<br />

				I once had alot of respect for this vendor and the time he would put out to make sure everyone had good customer service, its like the person transformed or something.. Now he was copy and pasting mass messages to like all customers.. <br /><br />And he was before promoting his review thread for people to get familiar with his products and now he has removed it..<br /><br />I am lucky enough to have received my package in about a month.. cause it seems like everyone has been getting scammed since then..<br /><br />Watch out when ordering from dream guys.

				Wow always sad when a vendor goes rogue. My experience with him was okay although the shipping was much slower than average. Legit MDA though. I thought i was done tripping and went to get food. I barely kept my shit together long enough to get back to my pad.
