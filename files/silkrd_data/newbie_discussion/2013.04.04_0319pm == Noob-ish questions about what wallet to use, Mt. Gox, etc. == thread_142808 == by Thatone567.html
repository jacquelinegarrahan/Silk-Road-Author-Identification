				So I&#039;m a little confused on what wallet/client I should use (and what exactly the difference is) and what &quot;exchange service&quot; site I should use. I&#039;ve been looking at Mt. Gox for that but according to this: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383<br />I should only register/log in to Mt. Gox from a computer not connected to me. How important is this? I don&#039;t know of any computers nearby that are either 1) not mine or 2) not connected to me through things like having to log in with an ID.<br /><br />Also, Instawallet is mentioned in the guide, but since it is down, is there another site I would be able to use in the meantime, or is it likely to go back up in the next few weeks/month?

				if you have cash and want to be completely anonymous about it use bit instant to gox with a fake name send a moneygram from walmart where they dont check ids then send the purchased bitcoins to another wallet from gox then from there to SR.. I had a hell of a time finding a spot that did money grams and didnt card. Hope this helped a little bit Im still new to SR but i know about BTC.

				It does, thank you. Is there a specific guide that you followed to learn what you did about bitcoin?<br /><br />Also, is it extremely important for me to not open/access an account on Mt. Gox from home, if I am only planning on buying personal amounts?

It&#039;s legal to own BTC, it&#039;s only a problem if they can trace the coins into SR. I&quot;m still looking for what I think is the most safe, efficient, and effective route for obtaining and using BTC and that requires getting accounts at places. Whatever I decide, I&#039;m sure that it will involve at least one step of tumbling, and I argue (and bet my safety on) that will be sufficient. I think we will see increased publicity for Silk Road related busts, but I&#039;ll bet every one of those will be following into someone&#039;s SR involvement AFTER they&#039;ve already been compromised.

				In the past I have tried coinbase, however they are slow and in the future I think blue sky traders will be my choice, as well as my recommendation.
