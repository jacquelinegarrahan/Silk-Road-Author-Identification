The fact that you were able to register your SR user name again adds some credibility to that scenario. I believe that DPR isn&#039;t including your overall purchase history or BTC&#039;s spent anymore in your Purchase Stats. From what I can remember, it now is based on your recent history (which he thinks is more relevant) rather than your older transactions. If you look through DPR&#039;s post history, you&#039;ll find one outlining this new feature in detail.&nbsp; :)

				If it is account deletion for inactivity it is sort of outlined in the Silk Road Wiki: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Will_my_account_be_deleted_for_inactivity.3F<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Silk Road wiki</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Will my account be deleted for inactivity?<br /><br />Accounts with zero balance will be archived if not logged into for several months. If you suspect your account has been archived, try creating a new user with the same name. If you cannot, then the account still exists. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				How long do you have to be inactive before your account is deleted?<br /><br />And does &quot;inactive&quot; mean you haven&#039;t signed into the account in a long time, or that you haven&#039;t placed an order in a long time?<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind logging in from time to time to keep my account active, but it&#039;d really suck if I have to keep placing orders that I don&#039;t want or can&#039;t afford, just to keep my account active.

				Your username was deleted because I asked you if you had a vendor account (you were offering drug samples as well as wanting to sell a bitcoin miner) - you didn&#039;t answer.&nbsp; I told you it was your one and only warning to stop advertising without a vendor account, but you ignored my post and instead continued to offer samples.&nbsp; (from what I could tell, you did not have a vendor account)&nbsp; So, as is policy, when you ignored the one and only warning and continued to break the rule about not selling without a vendor account, your account was deleted on the forums.
