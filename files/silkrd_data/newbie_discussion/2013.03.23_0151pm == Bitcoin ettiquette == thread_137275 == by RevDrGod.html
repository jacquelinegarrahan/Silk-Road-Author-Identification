				I have purchased a lot of Bitcoins since I first came aboard Silk Road. Most of the Bitcoins I have purchased, I have been credited with the purchase at the current Bitcoin rate at the time my money was accepted for the purchase. However, my last experience this last week was not that friendly.<br />&nbsp;I purchased coin on the 18th and didn&#039;t receive any coin until the 22nd. During this time Bitcoins went from approximately $46 to $73.<br />&nbsp;When I received my coin, I received the US dollar value of Bitcoins at the current Bitcoin rate as of the 22nd. <br />&nbsp;I bought my coin on the 18th not on the 22nd. It is not my fault the the vendor either cannot or will not credit me the coin I bought at the time of putrchase (Western Union). IT appears that the dealers are intentionally skimming from my coins. <br />&nbsp;If my payment is accepted on the 18th then I have purchased coin at the current rate on the 18th. I don&#039;t expect for the vendor to wait for the price of he coin to rise nearly$30 then give me coin, at it&#039;s US Dollar value .<br />&nbsp;The vendors are skimming my coins&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I correct in assuming that at the time the initial transaction that I am to receive coins at that rate? Or what?

				SR is not the best place to purchase bitcoins to be honest.<br />Have you talked with the vendor? If he&#039;s not willing to do anything at least warn others on his feedback about it. But there&#039;s not much you can do.My best advice is buy coins outside of SR, better prices and much safer.

				For the purpose of complete anonymity I have been purchasing coin on the Road. Isn&#039;t there inherent dangers to buying coins outside of the Road or the Tor network, specifically regarding anonymity? Mt.Gox for instance requires identification.

				There are various methods to buy bitcoins. Some of them anonymous, some not, it depends on where you live mostly. But whatever method you use, it is easy to mix/tumble/anonymize the coins, it has been discussed on the forums many times (search for bitfog and blockcahin.info&#039;s shared-send ). It takes some time but the fees are fair and you will never get scammed.

				Depends what country you live in, but buying btc needn&#039;t be a total headache.<br /><br />I&#039;m in the UK and our options are severely limited.<br />There&#039;s a vendor named BitcoinsUK, who will give good rates and won&#039;t dick you around, or you can purchase via the Blockchain &amp; Pingit method.<br />Again though, these are UK methods.<br /><br />My advice is to find a method that works, and stick with it. Regardless of fees etc.<br />I&#039;d rather go for reliability over faffing around with details. <br /><br />Search the forums though, there&#039;s a wealth of knowledge on the subject. Especially here in the noob board.
