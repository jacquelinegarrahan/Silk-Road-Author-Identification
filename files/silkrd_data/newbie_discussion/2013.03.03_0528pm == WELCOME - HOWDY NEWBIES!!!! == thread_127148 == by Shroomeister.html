				I have not been as active on the forums as of late. Just wanted to make a post in the Newbie forum since I never have!<br /><br /><br />HIIIIIII<br /><br />Welcome one and all to SR - Read the Rules - Stay in Escrow (unless you trust the vendor or the listing asks you not to and you MUST HAVE that item) and as always remember that anything less then a 5/5 hurts a vendor and their rating. <br /><br />At the end of dealings with a vendor - if you got legit product; safely and securely - chances are that is a 5/5 transaction.<br /><br />If it took 2 days longer then you hoped....or the item was not &quot;as strong&quot; as you had hoped - its still a 5/5 transaction.<br /><br /><br />If you got your coins took and got a bag of flour in the mail 2 months later - then we are looking at a 1/5<br /><br />TAKE THE TIME and actually write some feedback - THAT is what REALLY helps other potential buyers when looking at a listing.<br /><br />It is a bit annoying when a buyer gives a vendor a 4/5 but then only says &quot;its ok&quot; in the feedback......<br /><br /><br />And to all you buyers that have the &quot;no on is perfect - no one deserves a 5/5!&quot; - get over your self and learn how the system works here - there is no doubt (and plenty of threads, by both vendors and buyers) to back up the fact that the rating/feedback system is flawed.<br /><br />None the less this is the system we have to work with - learn how it works and what is expected as YOU a buyer and your time here will be smooth as SILK!<br /><br />Welcome one and all!<br />

				Nice post with decent newb material. Read everything you can. Double check everything; take a break; research; then double check again. Never FE, even if you have done multiple transactions.<br /><br />And be patient.
