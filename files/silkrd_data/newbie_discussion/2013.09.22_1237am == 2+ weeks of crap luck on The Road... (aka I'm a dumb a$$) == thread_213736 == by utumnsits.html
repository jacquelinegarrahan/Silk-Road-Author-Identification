				My luck has gone down the drain here on the road in the last couple of weeks.<br />Ordered a G of Blue Diamond from Diesel Therapy and got his cheaper product... I Finalized in good faith (AKA Stupidity) with the thought being that he&#039;d be able to rectify the mistake quicker if he had the coin.&nbsp; Multiple emails have been sent and not one has been read. Write that extra $50 off.<br />After tons and tons of stellar reviews of K Queen, I put in an order for 2g of Ket.&nbsp; The next day the order was cancelled and upon further research I see that K Queen has instituted a FE policy or all international orders due to some issue with bad connectivity with TOR. Odd... but hey, no biggie, this vendor has nothing but rave reviews... He/She&#039;ll deliver.&nbsp; LOL... kind of.&nbsp; Now what do the reviews say? SCAM SCAM SCAM!!! DO NOT FE!!<br />I make a first time transaction with a seemingly well respected opiate vendor who&#039;s been around for quite a while.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to name names on this one now as it&#039;s quite to screw you level... just at the DAMN!!! level. No FE require (won&#039;t do that anymore... learned the stupid way).&nbsp; I&#039;ve got quite the itch so I order EXPRESS for a hefty fee. I plug many different combos of my zip code with zips from metro areas all around the nation on the USPS website and see that all are NEXT DAY.&nbsp; Cool! Nope. Today would have been the second day and nothing... and of course today is Saturday so it will now be 4 days at the absolute soonest.<br />On the bright side I have one international order that finally arrived after 50 Days... FIFTY DAYS! I don&#039;t want to name this vendor though and although it took forever this vendor will have my business in the future believe it or not as they remained in contact the entire time and explained to many people about a costly internal issue that they had that caused a lot of orders to disappear. They then offered either a full refund or they reshipped and refunded the original shipping charge... and although they clearly had issues, they also had more integrity than I thought possible on The Road.<br />Hey, Monday is a new day and a new week. No more FE for me!
