				Hello Forum,<br /><br />This is my first post and I look forward to joining the discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />After a break of many years, I&#039;ve decided to resume my psychonautic voyages I so enjoyed at university.&nbsp; I guess its a better (and cheaper) way to deal with a mid-life crisis than a mistress or a menoPorsche.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />My question, however, is about the ability to experience psychedelics when one is on antidepressants.&nbsp; My personal cocktail is Zoloft and Welbutrin.&nbsp; My reading suggests that their resulting boost to Serotonin and Dopamine levels compromise the primary levers of my old friend Sid significantly.&nbsp; (They certainly do take the zip out of Charles.)<br /><br />Some commentators suggest not taking your meds on the day you plan to dose.&nbsp; Given that antidepressants work by saturation this strikes me as dubious advice.&nbsp; Alternatively, an extended hiatus risks discontinuation syndrome which is not pretty.<br /><br />Consequently I would welcome any experience or advice others may have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take care and all the best!

				If it&#039;s Sid it&nbsp; should be fine, it might be a tiny bit toned -down, but only a tiny bit if there&#039;s any reaction between the two.<br />You shouldn&#039;t really skip a dose of meds, besides, SSRIs stay in your system for a long time, so skipping on the day won&#039;t have any effect on how much of it is in your system. <br />If you&#039;re taking a serotonin releasing agent however like MDMA with an SSRI (like zoloft) you&#039;ll be wasting your time and money, the effect of MDMA is just negated.

				I don&#039;t take ssri&#039;s so don&#039;t have direct evidence. My indirect evidence is a bit confusing - I know people on ssri&#039;s who have told me no discernible difference, and others that have told me no difference on some occassions, but that it notably dulled the effect of lsd on others - obviously, these reports are suspect.<br /><br />Agian, not an ssri user - with mdma, the major risk is of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome<br /><br />If you use yourself as a guinea pig, try to report the results somewhere.

				Just some anec-data: I was on both zoloft and welbutrin (separately, not together). While on welbuttrin I took both acid and shrooms and they had extremely attenuated effects (barely anything). Take a tester, then take a lot, maybe? While on zoloft I snorted a good amount (.25mg?) of mdma and got nothing. I wouldn&#039;t even bother. (Also, seeing the comedown my friends had made me very much not want to experience it.) <br /><br />So, unfortunately, I think you&#039;re going to have a hard time tripping the light fantastic. You should probably stay on the meds and just smoke weed. FWIW, I&#039;ve also found iv heroin to be pretty great, so there&#039;s always that (haha). Good luck!

				Did someone really just recommend IVing heroin? ::facepalm::<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what you do, just don&#039;t go recommending that shit to people. Yeah sure it&#039;s great for pain yeah it gets you high but it also has the capacity to RUIN your LIFE. Almost ruined mine. <br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn&#039;t expect much of a trip if you&#039;re taking SSRI meds or anything that affects dopamine/serotonin/norepinephrine levels. It&#039;s ok to have a benzo handy for the end of the trip but otherwise I wouldn&#039;t take any anti-depressant at least a day before the trip happens. It will make your experience a hell of a lot better

				Wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone on antidepressants to use psychedelics. Took 2-CB while using a SSRI. Didn&#039;t experience any high but the days after i felt pretty bad.

				Thanks everyone!&nbsp; Much appreciated advice!&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t considered the impact on MDMA.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess when in doubt, weed will always sort it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />As an aside, while I doubt mainlining will ever be in my future, smoking opium in Laos proved unbelievably pleasant.&nbsp;

				Disregard what&nbsp; everyone says...<br />Everybodies&#039; physiology and psychology is completely different<br /><br />eg. someone posted they had little results with 2cb on antidepressants... i&#039;ve tripped fucking amazingly on 2cb on both prozac and citalopram... mdma is the only one that definitely doesn&#039;t work....<br /><br />Serotonin syndrome is not very understood however, the risk is that no-one actually knows who is susceptible.&nbsp; You won&#039;t run into trouble with acid that&#039;s for sure I believe, 2-c-t-X drugs are a little more up&nbsp; in the air though because of their MAO-inhibition<br /><br />Simply put.... tryptamines and acid good - Phenethylamines up in the air

In the worst case, that ends in death.<br /><br />Oxygen deprivation (also known as The Choking Game) supposedly also gives you a pretty good feeling. I&#039;ve seen a TV presenter who went into a pressurized cabin from the millitary air force, they wanted to see what happened to his cognitive function when deprived of oxygen.<br /><br />You saw him completely getting lost.. Not moving much, like a zombie, didn&#039;t talk, didn&#039;t respond, couldn&#039;t tell you his name.. Just sat there, eyes open.<br /><br />Afterwards the operator told him that if they would have left him in for another 1-2 minutes, he would&#039;ve been a goner. He just said he would be willing to pay as much as $250 for the experience he had. He saw colors and shit and everything.<br /><br />Please note this was a guy who had already tried probably more than 50 well-known drugs, but this experience blew him away.<br /><br />Mind you, I don&#039;t recommend it. I&#039;ve never done it and it&#039;s pretty bloody dangerous, and surely going to kill brain cells. I just thought it was an interesting story. And relevant since I don&#039;t see how it could possibly interfere with the medication.
