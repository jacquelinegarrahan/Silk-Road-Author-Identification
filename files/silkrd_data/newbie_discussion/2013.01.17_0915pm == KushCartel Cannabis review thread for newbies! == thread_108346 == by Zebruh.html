				Hey Guys, <br /><br />I figure this to be a good time to start a review thread of a new vendor on SR called KushCartel.<br /><br />KushCartel Vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d9a9bf46c5<br />&nbsp;<br />There&#039;s another review thread out there so this one will be for the newbies! KC offers Oz&#039;s and Quarters for a good price (~$205.00 per oz) along with a few edibles.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been talking to KC for a few days now and talked to him about ordering a QP which he said he would do. I placed the order on Tuesday 1/15/13 and still have not heard anything from him. Hopefully he is just busy and will get back to me soon! If he does I&#039;ll be sure to keep you all updated and also do a detailed review here once I receive it. If he doesn&#039;t then at least you guys all learned from my mistakes&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />If anyone else has made an order with KC or has talked to him feel free to put in your thoughts. We all have to look out for each other on the Road, lately it seems like there&#039;s been alot of scams going on. Safe Roading!<br />

				I haven&#039;t delt with KushCartel but wouldn&#039;t get too worried if its only been two days; is the order still processing or in transit? I ordered a sample from a new vendor recently and it took a few days to go from processing to in transit so I know how nerve racking it can be waiting with no answers and refreshing your SR page every 5 seconds hoping for a message lol.. but my sample arrived today :D&nbsp; &nbsp;As long as you stay in escrow all will end well!

				So I ordered an ounce of White Fire with express shipping from KushCartel Tuesday afternoon (you know, expecting to get it in 1-2 days since it&#039;s express and cost an extra 20 bucks) , and he said he&#039;d express it to me Wednesday afternoon and have a tracking number for me. On Thursday night when I inquired on the fact that it was still not in transit and I still hadn&#039;t been given a tracking number. When asked for explanation he responded &quot;Sorry for the delay bro I have to take a limited supply of package&#039;s to the post office every day I promise you will have your package by Saturday or monday no problem ...&quot; After offering me oh-so-obsequiously a &quot;free edible&quot; for the &quot;delay&quot;, he still hadn&#039;t given me the DCN tracking number I was promised, and so when I messaged him about this last night he responded an hour ago and said that there was &quot;no need to get cranky friend&quot; and that my package would be here by Thursday. So currently the estimate is 9 days wait for a package I paid express mail from. Why is everyone saying that this guy has fast shipping?

				one thing I found odd, on his feedback on his vendor page i noticed the following:<br /><br />his latest feedback ORIGINALLY said &quot;underweight, decent weed for the price&quot;<br />but NOW it says &quot; Update: overweight, and the weed is great for the price&quot;<br /><br />and the guy originally left 4/5, but is now a 5/5<br /><br />am i looking into this too much or is this cause for concern?

				I have been following KC&#039;s post and waiting for consistent legit reviews. I plan on purchasing from him but I pm&#039;d him first and asked when he could actually send the product out before I put in escrow. He has replied, said Tuesday, and seems legit but busy as hell. A lot of posts do seem similar but I think we could be over analyzing. Really, if he was scamming people; do you think he would still be hitting us back about sending stuff? I think he could have been swamped with orders, and is all out of whack. He is a new vendor so I think we should cut him some slack. I would hope someone would do the same for me being a newbie.. I’m still slightly cautious but those of you who have made orders, please be original with your review of the product so it doesn&#039;t seem like a bot or something. That would really help me and I think others out too. All In all, I think he is legit. Best of luck to everyone.<br />--Blurr--<br />

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I placed 2 orders last Tuesday(1/15) totaling a QP and paid for overnight shipping on both. I messaged KC several times and he kept assuring me that &quot;I was in the best of hands&quot; and that he would mail my package out yesterday(1/22) and send me a tracking number &quot;immediately&quot;. So, other than being pretty upset/disappointed that I paid an extra 60 bucks(30 each order of 2 oz) for OVERNIGHT shipping, I have had to wait over a week just for my package to be shipped. I messaged KC saying that I would either like my 60 dollars back because it clearly wasn&#039;t mailed overnight or I would like him to compensate accordingly and all he says is &quot;I assure you that you are in the best of hands brother&quot; MY ASS. KC is BY FAR the worst vendor I personally have ever dealt with on SR. His prices aren&#039;t really anything special and I can sure as hell attest to his service and communication being absolutely horrible. To be honest if I were any of you guys I wouldn&#039;t give KC a chance. You are putting your money in jeopardy and you&#039;ll save yourself a lot of worrying if you just steer clear of em. This is just my personal experience and opinion. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be sure to update you when/if I ever receive the product.

				I have made 3 orders with KC. <br /><br />first one i paid for priority and he gave me express shipping, came timely and the product was great<br /><br />two days later i ordered another oz, on the weekend of January 12. still has not arrived yet. im getting kind of worried about this package honestly. i messaged him to see if he can check tracking yesterday and still have not heard back, but will give him to atleast tonight to answer. <br /><br />have another order from him that he should have shipped out tuesday. he told me that this one should be &quot;right behind&quot; the second package.<br /><br />he kinda fell off after getting many orders i bet, but still trying to stay hopeful. atleast my money is still in escrow. even though he offers a reship, at this rate of service i wouldn&#039;t even get that one by next year.

I also have a package that should have been shipped out Tuesday but I highly doubt it actually did since there has been zero communication from him what so ever and he promised to send the tracking &quot;immediately&quot;. One good thing is that from what I&#039;ve been reading we&#039;ve all stayed in escrow. So IF things work the way they&#039;re supposed to and we don&#039;t receive a package hopefully the resolution center will do the correct thing and refund us our money. <br /><br />Good luck to all of those who have placed orders with KC and continue to let us know whats going on! We&#039;re all in this together. There&#039;s many ways that the vendors are protected from things like this yet hardly anything to protect us buyers. Which is why we have to stick together! Threads like this will help the next would be buyer steer clear of a possible scammer and will definitely save them a headache!

				as i posted on another thread, i placed my order with confidence on monday night and have been in contact with KC before and after my order was placed. It sucks to those who have paid for next day mail, and i understand that. but truthfully, shit happens. especially to a new vendor who im sure was not expecting this much volume in such a short time. keep the faith. escrow is there for a reason, and we are all in it. worst comes to worst the resolution center will be on our side for a vendor who has only been in business for 20+ days, 30 transactions, and a hoard of complaints against him. we are all safe, so pop a pill and relax, its coming or were getting our money back. RELAX!

I&#039;m in the Midwest&nbsp; where things usually take about 2-3 days to get here from Cali. most of the time 2 unless there&#039;s a small hitch or something but I sure as hell would rather wait 3 days than be waiting 11 days for my damn package to be SHIPPED. I hope you all receive what you ordered, Maybe he&#039;s just a selective scammer when it comes to bulk? Either way I&#039;m beyond annoyed with KC, I was relaxed the first week waiting for it to be shipped, now I&#039;m just upset and disappointed that he is so lazy and unorganized that he can&#039;t even mail some packages and send tracking numbers to the corresponding people that made the orders. It&#039;s not rocket science.

				Hey KushCartel got back to me last night with tracking for what I believe is my second package. Looks like the package got reshipped, maybe that&#039;s why it took so long. Seems like the guy knows what hes doing to stay stealthy. <br /><br />Zebruh, just stay patient for this week. I feel your pain, on not getting easily much larger order than I did and paying extra to get it quicker.<br /><br />also mine is supposed to come tomorrow. maybe yours will too. :)&nbsp; <br /><br />

Unfortunately he is not, he has 30 transactions total. That&#039;s nothing compared to what some vendors on here do and some vendors on here do tripple that in a single week and STILL have better communication and sure as hell get their product mailed out way quicker than KC. I find it very interesting that he is only messaging you back while myself and many others haven&#039;t heard from him in a&nbsp; week or so. Again, the term selective scammer comes to mind. Perhaps since I ordered bulk he took it as an opportunity to make a quick buck and went for it. Either way this clearly shows that he is ignoring many of our messages, and for what reason? I should have known better than to order from someone with the name &quot;cartel&quot; in their name, after all, the cartel never does business fair, and from my experience so far either does KC.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m glad this thread has helpped a few people who did some research before placing an order. I&#039;m not sure if you guys order bulk or just a little something to smoke on for yourself but if you do indeed order bulk I would check out SourDiesel Man. I made 1 order with him a few weeks back and it was some BOMB indoor blue dream for even cheaper than KC and was here pretty quick. Sadly I had read 1 or 2 reviews saying his product quality was inconsistent and I let that deter me which led me to KC. 10 days later I have no bud and I&#039;m out a grand. Safe to say this expierence showed me the real differences between a good vendor and an absoloutly horrile one. My frusteration level with KC is through the roof and at this point I&#039;m just waiting on the resolution center because I have no faith that the package will come. <br /><br />Let us know how the bud is when you get it though lacks!

				I ordered an oz of white fire on 1/18, I still haven&#039;t received it yet. Same story as the rest, he responded quickly at first then nothing for 10 days. He messaged me this morning and assured me it would be here by saturday and he would give me tracking tomorrow. I&#039;ll update if/when it arrives.<br /><br />Today I also found a vendor that has a nearly identical vendor page to KushCartel, with large sections copied. This vendor seems to be selling some of the quality weed people have been reporting getting from KC. I don&#039;t really know where to bring this to anyone&#039;s attention, I&#039;m new here, this was my first order in fact. I was not cautious enough I see.<br /><br />Here are their vendor pages:<br /><br />The Drug Spot<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/65e263730b<br /><br />KushCartel<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d9a9bf46c5

Stop lying to your customers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108346.msg779128#msg779128">Quote from: nerdfour on January 30, 2013, 11:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Today I also found a vendor that has a nearly identical vendor page to KushCartel, with large sections copied.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t get. If you run a account honestly and actually have a secure way of cashing out, there&#039;s crazy money to be made here. I guess these guys can&#039;t really see past a few weeks, though.

				Ok, I guess I finally had to bite the proverbial bullet and join the forums. Allow me to preface this by saying I&#039;ve had nothing but 5/5 transactions on my 15 previous orders over 4 months so possibly I was feeling overly confident when I placed my order with this huckster. I ordered KushCartel&#039;s White Fire OG and god damn am I sorry I did. <br />Here is a copy of the message I sent to KC last night after receiving my order:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&quot;Please do not issue a bad review feedback until I have tried to resolve the issue&quot;<br />KushCartel,<br />As it stands you are at a 1/5 feedback rating from me.<br />These are my reasons<br />1) The shipping time<br />The date I placed my order January 17, 2013, 4:06 am UTC<br />The date it was marked in transit January 18, 2013, 6:14 am UTC<br />Besides the obvious fact it wasn&#039;t mailed until January 30th. I never once got any communication letting me know you were backed up, misplaced, or had forgotten to mail my order. I can afford to have some money tied up for awhile, but not knowing when to expect it left me reluctant to purchase any smoke from anyone else, and worse than that, had me questioning if the order had possibly been seized.<br />2) Communication<br />I never once received a message about my order not being sent on the date it was listed as in transit. I messaged you on January 25, in an attempt to receive the tracking code. I received no response to my message, and sent you another message on January 28. This message asked you to please cancel my order if it had not been placed in transit. The next day I was dismayed to see your brief response which stated. &quot;ok kool and yes you should receive it on Friday&quot;. So not only had my order not been placed in transit, instead of canceling it as I had politely requested you decided to finally mail it.<br />3) Product<br />This was by far the most unsatisfactory element of our transaction. In the description you list the product as &quot;Indoor White Fire OG Kush&quot; this is clearly not true. The product is also listed as &quot;All the nugget&#039;s are frosty inside and out LOUD!!&quot; The product I received smells, looks, and tastes like border weed.<br />Forgive me if I have little faith that you will attempt to resolve these issues with me. I sent you this message as you request &quot;Please do not issue a bad review feedback until I have tried to resolve the issue&quot; on your vendor page. I am not expecting any resolution will be reached but I am doing my best to give you the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Carradinedreams<br /><br />To this message I received a one digit response. The subject line simply said 0.<br /><br />So Mr Kush,<br />Please go fuck yourself. Take a long bus ride across India dressed as a woman and maybe some horny rapists will give you what you have coming. You are a piece of human garbage, two bit fucking conman. I was gonna try to keep the vitriol to a minimal but I suppose getting hustled tends to bring the worst out of me. <br />Classic &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; move from KC the SchwagCartel. What he sent me I used to get in high school a decade ago for $80.00 I&#039;m a grown ass man what the fuck am I gonna do with a bag of ditch weed? I couldn&#039;t get $200.00 for this garbage in prison. Maybe for your next trick you can come up here and steal my car stereo you god damned low life street rat. <br /><br />Have a cancer filled life,<br />Carradinedreams<br /><br /><br />Apologies for my insensitivity to the atrocities in India it&#039;s just the worst thing I can currently think of. Yes I am aware that a couple hundred dollars isn&#039;t going to cause me to go homeless or anything it&#039;s just the damn principal of the whole thing.

				KC finally responded on 1/30, assuring me my purchase would be here on saturday (2/2) and that he would have tracking for me the following day. He didn&#039;t send me the tracking until 2/2, which says my package will arrive tomorrow (2/4). Here&#039;s the order info:<br /><br />ordered: January 18, 2013, 7:52 pm UTC<br />shipped: January 22, 2013, 12:04 pm UTC<br /><br />The tracking he sent me says it was accepted 1/31. So it was marked in transit 9 days before it was actually sent? Without as much as a message to let me know there would be a delay? Wow. I&#039;m trying not to jump the gun here, but from the responses in this thread I&#039;m not at all confident it will be the White Fire OG I was expecting. Seems like some people got what they ordered though, it sounds like he ran out and hoped nobody would notice. I will update again tomorrow, not that it will really matter, it appears KC is no longer a vendor anyway.

				So is the account banned?

Just don&#039;t pay for faster shipping, you won&#039;t get it sooner than 7 days.<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the price it&#039;s some pretty good bud, smells great and looks great, but shipping times definitely need improved. I received an international order from Belgium that I ordered after this bud and I received the international order first...<br />4 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good product for the price and smell proof package. Communication and shipping time lacking. I assume this is just a result of an unsuspecting new vendor. Not a scam, just trying to learn the road. Would do business again if shipping time <br /><br />What up with this shit?? No fucking way these are all real. I know my bud smelled about as appealing as a bag of raked leaves.
