				I remember a while back everyone was ranting and raving about Tormail being unsafe for some reason. I haven&#039;t used it since because of that. <br /><br /><br />Is that still the case? If so, why is it being avoided?

				I noticed the other day that when I went to the site, it said &quot;Hacked by [somebody I forgot the name] and I was unable to do anything. So I was wondering if it was safe, but yeah, I had never heard anything about it being unsafe before, nor have I heard much about it in general. I&#039;ve heard that hushmail is a good service for private email that doesn&#039;t track you.

				It was never safe.&nbsp; No one knows who owns, operates or funds it and the server owners and operators can read all of the emails.&nbsp; Use PGP and you will be fine.

If you haven&#039;t figured out PGP yet, this is high time to learn it. When using Tormail just use squirrelmail link and disable javascript for extra safety. Coupled with PGP, it&#039;s very secure.

				lol no doubt<br /><br />You can use your regular email account with PGP also but a throw away account where your not ask for any identifying evidence is always best<br /><br />lavabit.com<br />tormail.org<br /><br />that is only 2 of them but there are countless other where you can use fake info and not have to use an9other email addy to verify it
