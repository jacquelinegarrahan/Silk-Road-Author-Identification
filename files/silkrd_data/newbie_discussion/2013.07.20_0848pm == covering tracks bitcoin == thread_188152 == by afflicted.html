				The purchase of bit coins from a bank account should alert anyone with any intelligence. It&#039;s an easy thing to check and flag.<br /><br />I go to a bank and transfer cash into their account.

Your Bank knows you bought bitcoins&nbsp; :( I&#039;m assuming bitcoin fox is a laundry service so the coins you bought don&#039;t end up silkroad directly , which is good&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; buying from your bank account is a real no no . HOWEVER , 1 transaction for bitcoins from your bank is not going to raise flags ( I&#039;m assuming it wasn&#039;t for $100,000) but I wouldn&#039;t do it again if I was you .</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I use Coinbase and buy with my bank account(super simple since coins are 100%&nbsp; legal) and then I send them to a Blockchain wallet and finally to SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just limiting my coin transfers to about once a month, twice at most, so I don&#039;t raise flags with my bank.

Its a great way to wash your coins and remove any trace that they originated from you. I&#039;d recommend using them if you bought BTC in a way that could be linked back to you (bank account)<br /><br />Here is their URL:<br />fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion

				I worry about the money laundering law when buying bitcoins above board. While they are perfectly legal, if you can&#039;t keep track of them, as a vendor it probably isn&#039;t so bad as you can separate coins on way out and claim you were simply just trading hence having 10% more etc and keep your profits as a stash somewhere else.<br /><br />How do people cash their coins out secretly?<br /><br />
