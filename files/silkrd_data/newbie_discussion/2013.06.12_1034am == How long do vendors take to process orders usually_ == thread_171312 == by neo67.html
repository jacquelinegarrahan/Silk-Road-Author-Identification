				Welcome to the road!!<br /><br />It will sometime say on the vendors profile page how long you can expect to wait. Most people i order from advise that if you order before 3 then it will get posted same day.<br /><br />And most orders i place generally change to &#039;In Transit&#039; within 24 hours of me placing the order (Most times a lot quicker) but i have had to wait up to 48 hours

				As mentioned by Luvs2Trip you will almost always find this information on any specific vendors profile, but for a little more in depth for what it comes down to for us atleast:<br /><br />* Orders: The amount of orders coming in for that specific day, more means longer if there&#039;s too many.<br />* Materials: How many materials have been prepared and are ready to be used for packaging when the order comes in.<br />* Problems: Any issues like for example with the computer, printer or the broadband connection.<br />* Rules: Any non-declared rules like custom prices will create a time sink when having to figure something out on the spot.<br />* Preparation: Getting the computer up and running, equipping gloves etc., usually something that only has to be done once per working day.<br />* Personal: Any issue in our personal lives which might create delay, like having to go on a trip for example - anything longer than a day and we will list it on our profile.<br /><br />We&#039;re actively working to reduce the time spent on any specific category. We occasionally track how long it takes for us to process one order and try to figure out how we can reduce that as much as possible. A good example where we could reduce the packaging time for any shipment is cutting up our product more quickly, we don&#039;t quite know what equipment we should use for that though - more information on that specific problem in this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169901.msg1212745<br /><br />Worth keeping in mind we don&#039;t have that many orders per day yet, if we suddenly would get 80 orders per day our current way of doing things is not good enough yet. It would be very interesting to hear some details on how it works with vendors who get so many orders they have to keep more than two people employed, like for example budsupplies or jesusofrave.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks for your detailed breakdown Burning Babylon! explains it very well....................i should of just shut up and remained patient! lol<br /><br />However, i have only purchased bitcoins from this particular vendor so i guess the processing time will be significantly less than other products.<br /><br />I will sit tight but i am eager to get shopping!! :)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				A vendor has up to 4 days to mark the item &quot;in transit&quot;, per the rules.<br />Usually most sellers mark them as &quot;in transit&quot; within 48 hours and like others have said, that info is usually posted on their vendor page.<br />Go to work<br />

Also it is not advised to buy bitcoins becuase of how easy it is to scam people and you will get no help from SR support if you do get scammed! There are however some vendors that seem reputable although I couldn&#039;t advise as I have never bough coins of SR

				I&#039;m paying through Western Union, i tell the vendor how many dollars worth of bitcoins i want, give him my BTC address, he gives me WU payment details (hopefully! as he hasn&#039;t yet, only ordered this morning though) then i send through the payment.<br /><br />Sound legit??<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard about the scamming,etc but it is really a last resort as i struggled to find a suitable UK third party exchanger for my bitcoins.<br /><br />

				A couple days seems reasonable. But it&#039;s like any other business, unexpected things happen, stuff like that, maybe had to take a day off shipping, etc. I figure as long as the vendor has recent good positive feedback that&#039;s about the best you can do. I&#039;ve noticed you really have to read the feedback, because most people will still leave a 5 (since it seems some vendors will not deal with you again if you leave less than 5), but will give hints later in their review as to any issues/opportunities for improvement.<br /><br />The WU to BTC from what I&#039;ve seen often uses bitinstant.com, which, at least in the U.s. at the moment I don&#039;t think is working, some issue with ZipZap not processing the payments properly or something.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in jam there&#039;s fast vendors here who will take moneypak or reloadit and transfer you BTC pretty darn quickly.

				Well it does say on the vendor page to wait at least a week for shipping to arrive (to the UK), however i think that is based on an actual physical product been shipped, i&#039;m just getting money converted to bitcoins so i guess my question was how long do vendors usually take to send out WU payment details and then put bitcoins in my SR wallet?<br /><br />I think i&#039;ll settle on 48 hours as this is what alot of people have lent towards.<br /><br />peace.

There are obviously other bad reasons as well like for example Western Union being an inefficient means of moving money and leaving a clear trail most of the case.<br /><br />The key here is it would be fine (although not very secure) if this process had been established entirely outside of Silk Road, ie. the customers never used Silk Road to begin with when they met etc.

				Ok i can see what your saying Burning Babylon, but how will leave it leave a trail? do you need I.D when sending money via Western Union or do you mean they may be suspicious with the account i&#039;m paying?<br /><br />I have tried to find a UK BTC vendor&nbsp; but with no luck as of yet.......I just thought this would be a easier option, have you any ideas for a UK BTC vendor?<br /><br />Also can i cancel this order if i do decide not to go ahead with it.....i made the order through the checkout system but it says i cant cancel until<br />after 3 days.<br /><br />thanks.

				neo67, what about using a clearnet bitcoin site such as localbitcoins.com or going on bitcointalk.org and finding a seller on there? You don&#039;t need to mention why you&#039;re buying them nor is there too much risk as long as you keep the transaction size small.

				We check for orders twice a day, mail pick up is by 10am, so if we get the order before 10 we try to get it in before the next pick up. <br />We figure, we still need those good reviews, so it is in our best interest to keep you as happy as possible.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e292c918c4<br /><br />Happy Hunting <br />
