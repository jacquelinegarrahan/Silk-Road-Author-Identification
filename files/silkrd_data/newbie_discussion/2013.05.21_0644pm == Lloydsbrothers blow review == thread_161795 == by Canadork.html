				I had read a few reviews saying that they had some of the best coke, and I decided I&#039;d give it a try. Unfortunately, my package some how go forgotten about, and after waiting about 20 days, I finally sent them a message asking what&#039;s up. They responded later that day saying that they couldn&#039;t find any record of my order being shipped, but that they see it in the resolution center. They offered either a refund, or a reship, and I chose reship. <br /><br />It only took a bit over a week to arrive here when it was finally shipped. Stealth was everything it needed to be. And how was the product?<br /><br />Sweet jesus is it ever good. I&#039;m not a connoisseur when it comes to coke, but this is the smoothest stuff I&#039;ve ever had. Last time I did coke I was bouncing off the walls, unable to sit still. With this stuff, a two inch line has me high out of my tree, but I almost feel....relaxed. It&#039;s strange. I&#039;m definitely high as fuck, but I don&#039;t feel like i want to start chewing the buttons off my keyboard. It&#039;s the best coke I&#039;ve ever had, by far.<br /><br />5/5, would definitely buy from again.

				My friend,<br /><br />so glad to read your review and so glad you described what good coke should be like, that relaxed feeling yet high, focused yet hyper, chatty but not confused. glad you have understood that and appreciated it without looking for the tense feeling that cut cocaine gives you. You&#039;d be surprised at how many people don&#039;t know what cocaine really is and when they don&#039;t feel anxiously high they don&#039;t consider it good.<br /><br />anyway glad to see you enjoyed it properly :)<br /><br />LB
