				From what I understand LL is one of the best vendors to order from.<br /><br />Last time I checked though he was only selling bulk which (for me) isn&#039;t worth the risk.

				I seriously dislike the idea of FE, and usually would recommend finding another vendor - one who doesn&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; However, if he requires FE, he&#039;s probably one of the safer vendors to FE for.

				Once I&#039;ve sold through my current stuff, I&#039;m probably going with LL... prices would cut my margin down, but missing shipments and scams have hurt me a LOT.

				I have not had the pleasure of dealing with him yet. but i feel he is one of the best vendors here. I lurk these forms quite abit and hes probably the only vendor id trust to FE with. Lucky is the man and i wish nothing but great things for him.

				I&#039;d love to order from him, but I have to start off kinda small :(... The plan is to get a decently priced 10g order (which is nearly impossible anywhere other than from EU somewhere). After that, I plan on ordering from LL and hopefully never dealing with a single other vendor again.&nbsp; He&#039;s very appealing to anyone in the US because of his prices and location (Canada basically IS domestic for us). I&#039;d rather not get orders from Netherlands and the like, so I really can&#039;t wait till I can get on with LL. <br /><br />To Luckylucianno:&nbsp; &nbsp; You would murder the road if you had a 10 g listing. Alas, I&#039;ve read you&#039;re profile and I know where you stand on the issue. worth a shot, right? haha
