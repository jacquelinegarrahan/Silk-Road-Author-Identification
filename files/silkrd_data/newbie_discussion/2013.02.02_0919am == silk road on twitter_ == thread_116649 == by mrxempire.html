				Today, I noticed that there are fan pages for Silk Road on Twitter, and on Facebook too, I believe. As much as I love what Silk road is trying to accomplish, I disagree with these public fan pages. The less people that know about SR, the better. Although many people believe that SR cannot be stopped by DEA or any type of law enforcement, why play with fire? The more people that know about Silk Road, the more attention it will draw. I feel like if enough people know about Silk Road, there will be so much backlash from angry parents and anti-drug people that a drastic move will be done by the U.S (where i am from) that will make it extremely difficult for us to use Silk road. Perhaps a ban on moneygram orders, that are used to purchase bitcoins. Or perhaps, the government decides to post a K-9 drug unit in every post office to make sure no Silk road packages reach their destination. I don&#039;t want things over here to be like Australia or New Zealand, where they have to pay 2 or 3 times the normal price to have their packages shipped to them. If I knew for a fact that Silk Road could never be destroyed or compromised, believe me, I would laugh in the face of any who opposed us. But the truth is, we don&#039;t know this to be true. So, in my opinion, I feel that we should bring as little attention to Silk Road as possible for the time being. I only tell very close friends about this website, and I belive all of you should try to keep this as much of a secret as you can. Please share your opinions on Silk road publicity if you can.<br /><br /><br />P.S: LONG LIVE SILK ROAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! D.P.R YOU ARE MY HERO MAY YOU DRINK MARTINIS ON THE BEACH EVERY DAY!
