Don;t&nbsp; do to muck coke only 2 times a month.&nbsp; But whatever, yeah the reason I responded back to this thread because I think somebody could be intersted in employing me. You know the reason I ask is I&nbsp; can do something very well that can benfit thi site and in turn Learn other things.&nbsp; Like send out emails help out with vendor promblems stuff like that.&nbsp; IT stuff that this site needs help with..&nbsp; &nbsp;thant the admin can benfit for paying people to help out.&nbsp; So they can do ther things. Don;t know bro.&nbsp; I&#039;m mean&nbsp; if I start seeing some money.&nbsp; Ill give you my real name so you can check me out.&nbsp; Just tell me if I&#039;m wastung my time asking for employment.&nbsp; Because in all honetly I don&#039;t got time to be on a forum any forum&nbsp; just to chit chat.&nbsp; I mena if I can do It things that you knowI can learn pretty quick and that it well help me out.&nbsp; Put on my Resume.Shit I just work here.
