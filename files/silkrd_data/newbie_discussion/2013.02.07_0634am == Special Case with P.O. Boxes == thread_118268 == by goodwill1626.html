				Title: <strong>Special Case with P.O. Boxes</strong><br />

				Ok, I have spent the last week reading the forum and I have a few questions about P.O boxes in my location. I am sorry if there are answers out there that I missed, but I just would like to know some opinions before I place my first order. <br /><br />1) I live in a small town and the largest P.O. box is too small to fit a package the size of a shoe box. I will have to pick up my packages that exceed this size at the front desk. I know this seems risky but how risky is it if I am ordering only personal amounts?<br /><br />2)Personal amounts of what? I was thinking weed (which how worried should I be about the smell?), cannabis edibles (like brownies), and maybe some shrooms. Are these safe to order given the circumstances with the small P.O. box.<br /><br />3) The post office is not 24 hrs, should I be worried about this? About being on camera, or being victimized by a controlled delivery (especially for personal amounts)?<br /><br />I&#039;d appreciate any input on these questions. I am new at this and don&#039;t want to make a fatal mistake from the get go. Thanks!

NOT sketchy picking up an oversize package)<br /><br />{quote] 2)Personal amounts of what?
