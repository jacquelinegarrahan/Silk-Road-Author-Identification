				just stick with the top venders on SR, So far i have a total of 17 successful transactions and i have been a member for 3 months, spending a total of à¸¿159.35 8), my 18th transaction has been with OldAmsterdam spending a total of&nbsp; $1,170.36, i still never received the 50gs of MDMA I order but im very faithful it will show up soon.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about what your ordering, keep on top of the vender lists and read comments.

				I just hate it when it is marked in transit right away when I know it can&#039;t be. Then of course I sit and wait for longer than it&#039;s possible if it were sent that day until it shows up. If a vendor can&#039;t be honest when he actually ships I will not use them again. I understand selling is hard work but I will not give you a 5 if you bullshit me and this is just that. I happen to be busy too in my life it&#039;s no excuse.

				I was excited.. maybe a bit nervous when putting in my address, but tbh that quickly passed. <br />Some small risk to me does exist of course, but given the nature of what is done here, I accept that. <br /><br />I was more frustrated with figuring out PGP keys and buying bitcoins in the UK.&nbsp; Two things I had no previous experience with. But now that&#039;s sorted, it&#039;s all systems go. Any trepidation has long since left me. lol <br /><br />

				My first order was just placed a few days ago (expecting delivery tomorrow, maybe day after).&nbsp; After going through the tor and bitcoin dance, I was pretty excited to place my first order.&nbsp; I spent a few hours reading the forums and then placed an order with one of the top rated pot vendors.&nbsp; Just simple order for a 1/4 ounce of some pretty good bud.&nbsp; Being a total noob, I hadn&#039;t even figured out the PGP thing...yes, my name and address are out in the open [yawn...so not worried].&nbsp; I&#039;ve finally got the encryption thing down so that should be the only time that happens.&nbsp; As an older white collar worker, it is next to impossible to &#039;safely&#039; find dealers.&nbsp; I&#039;m crossing my fingers that this place will be what I&#039;m looking for.<br /><br />I actually tried to place a second order with another vendor yesterday who had a really good deal going on.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I learned that not having any purchases works against me.&nbsp; Totally understandable, but still a bit of a surprise being a new buyer.&nbsp; Once I get a few purchases under my belt, I&#039;ll be hooking up with that vendor.

				I was pretty nervous but that faded quickly. I ordered 200 pills, so bigger than most first time orders but by no means huge. I remember watching the mailman drop it in my box and I was like &quot;... no fucking way... somebody on the other side of a country slapped a label with my name on it on a box and mailed me drugs&quot;. I haven&#039;t hit up anyone local for anything other than a quarter of weed or less since, and every time I&#039;m just like, &quot;Damn this shit is sub-par, should&#039;ve just gotten it on SR lol.

				My mate had been using the SR for a few months, with 100% success rate, so this calmed my nerves a little.&nbsp; That said, it was still a little nervy.&nbsp; Each day I got home from work I&#039;d sort through the mail looking for that &quot;special envelope&quot; and when it arrived there was further trepidation as I carefully open it to access and inspect the goods.&nbsp; &nbsp;The biggest worry was when I&#039;d tried a brand new (and unproven) vendor, especially when one took 4 weeks to arrive from Vietnam. Fortunately when it finally arrived I was not disappointed! <br /><br />Now, 30 transactions in,, with 100% success rate, it&#039;s become pretty normal, and I stick to my shortlist of tried and tested vendors.&nbsp; It&#039;s still exciting when you know something is due and you hear the mail drop through the letterbox....&nbsp; although excitement can quickly switch to disappointed and an extra day of waiting....<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been buying legal RC&#039;s off the internet for a couple years now, and buying off of silk road for the first time was like the first time buying an RC; nervousness, paranoia, and a LOT of excitement. For some reason I was a little less anxious about the whole thing than my first RC purchase, mainly because with all my experience ordering drugs has shown me how safe it really is to buy domestically (not 100%, there&#039;s ALWAYS risk involved in having grey/black market products sent to your house, never forget this!). I guess the only real difference is that instead of something unscheduled it&#039;s usually something a little more illegal&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Safety first everyone! And that goes for both taking drugs AND staying out of legal trouble. Unfortunately, getting arrested and charged with a crime involving drugs can fuck your life up worse than having a bad trip because you took a little too much.

				Buying off SR the first time reminds me of the very first intro to Breaking Bad where Walter is seen filming a quick goodbye to his family because he thinks he&#039;s about to get caught.<br /><br />Only to find himself pointing a revolver at a firetruck, in white-tighties<br />Does anyone else see the similarity?

				I reckon I&#039;d have been A LOT more nervous with my first order(s) if I resided in the US of A.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much harsher penalties for drugs... etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the UK things are a lot more relaxed and I feel the police are unlikely to commit serious manpower to intercepting the odd gram of a drug sent in the post.&nbsp; If something was intercepted, it&#039;s hard to imagine UK LE conducting a controlled delivery to try and nail the supposed &#039;buyer&#039;.&nbsp; Not to say it hasn&#039;t happened, but very rare in my opinion.<br /><br />Between my friends and I (all in UK) we&#039;ve got 90+ transactions under our belt with 100% success rate.

				I went to the post office that faithful morning expecting to be thrown to the ground by le the second i grabbed my bundle of joy. it really freaked me out bcuz the police station is right across the street. so as time slowed down as i opened the door that i would soon find led me to a new way of making transactions the package was there. i grabbed it,checked where it was from as if to be suprised by what i found. this wasnt neccesary bcuz i was the only soul in the box hallway. i walked out the door,past the line of po employees steadily fufilling orders, a smile came across my face. a smile so big and full of joy that i still have wrinkles from to this very day. since then its been buisness as usually with about 10 more transactions and counting. fuck the other side of town where i risk getting shorted ,robbed,shot,possibly arrested bcuz the dealer is already under surveillance.there is a new guy in town,thanks to the road.

				Like many others, I waited a few months observing and getting secure before I made my first order...<br />I wasn&#039;t nervous because I had done my homework and picked a reputable vendor.<br /><br />Funny story though <br /><br />My first order was an overnight express set to come on sat....about an hour before my mailman usually arrives two well dressed men with brief cases came to my door. When I first saw them out my window my heart droppedI opened the door (i had of course prepared for any questions) and what do you know it was fucking Jehovah&#039;s witnesses out spreading the word in my hood....I literally started laughing when I saw the god apocalypse pamphlets in their briefcases. <br />An hour later my package came perfect and I did a happy dance, luckily they gave me some bonuses which needed that day lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;I love SR and was really just excited that it actually worked.<br /><br />For the paranoid who read this --- yes, they were for sure Jehovah&#039;s witnesses i recognized their faces from their previous visits ( I think there are 5 total in all of the U.S.) and I saw them harassing other houses <br /><br />Moral of the story----if you buy from trusted vendors you have nothing to worry about---they know what they are doing.<br /><br /><br />

				Extremely nervous from start to finish.

				I literally just put in my first order. My friends and I have always said, &quot;we should order something from Silk Road,&quot; but nobody ever did it -- until now. I&#039;m currently bragging to my friends about it. I felt pretty calm through the ordering process, except for PGP. That was a little confusing.

Personally, I like to send them to my personal bitcoin wallet and then to the Silk Road just to put another step in between my cash purchase and the silk road but I&#039;m probably just being over cautious. If you want a local bitcoin client/wallet http://multibit.org/ is probably the most user friendly of all the bitcoin clients.<br /><br />And yes, it can take several hours for your coins to deposit into your SR wallet (or non-SR wallet). This is because it takes the bitcoin network time to confirm the transfer of bitcoins from one wallet to another in order to prevent fraudulent transactions. That being said, it rarely will take 6 hours. In my experience it&#039;s usually more like 1-2.
