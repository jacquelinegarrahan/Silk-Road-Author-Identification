				First i would like to say hey to everyone! I have been checking this place out for years ( i remember when btc=$8) but now I&#039;m ready to become a vendor and start contributing.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m really a bit paranoid as I&#039;m not sure how i should go about protecting myself. I know just running tor on windows is not enough, but I&#039;m not sure where to go to get the information i need. I plan on using a separate laptop from random wifi networks to do my selling (never in my own home).&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how i should set this up and how to close all the possible &quot;holes&quot; into my system.&nbsp; Any direct advice would be appreciated, but feel free to provide me with a link b/c I&#039;m sure this has been a common topic.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks in advance!

				Search the forums, I&#039;d guess the security forum but ........the truth is out there. I think there&#039;s a way to have your Tor and other stuff on an external device, like a USB memory stick and plug in&nbsp; that in when Roading. I know that was vague but so am I right now&nbsp; :o .

				I don&#039;t see your wifi as an issue unless you&#039;re planning on moving kilos of hard drugs. If I were you I&#039;d worry a whole lot more on how you plan on <br /><br />1) putting your merchandise in containers that don&#039;t leak out at all. Even micrograms that escape a plastic bag through pores in the membrane put your package at risk of interception<br />2) Shipping parcels in such a way that you leave no personal marks that could be traced back to you or your home or wherever you&#039;re preparing your stuff from<br />3) Choosing dropoff locations and times that are randomized enough that you never create a pattern LE can get hip to<br /><br />I would think another weak link is postage. How do you pay for shipping without arousing suspicion? If you are a business you can put your drug business into the same stream and hide the trail. Then again it also sounds like doing it this way raises the risk for your business considerably.<br /><br />We really need a newbie vendor guide but the successful sellers aren&#039;t likely to want to give up their secrets because they don&#039;t want the competition and they don&#039;t want to raise their risk profile either so no matter which way you cut it you&#039;re putting yourself at risk.<br /><br />My guess is that reselling RCs would be the lowest risk drug business to get your feet wet since they are so small and scent free that they can be sent in regular prepaid envelopes.

I think you can buy boxes and packing stuff that&#039;s stamped according to what weight/size your mailing. So I guess you would just buy a bunch of those according to your needs then go home and pack and seal them then go out to any random mailbox in town and put your stuff in it, I guess with a return address that can&#039;t be linked back to you.

				I am taking stealth very seriously so i don&#039;t think i will have a problem there, plus i don&#039;t plan on moving large amounts . I just want to protect my identity..&nbsp; I guess i&#039;ll have to search around, it just takes forever to find what I&#039;m looking for.
