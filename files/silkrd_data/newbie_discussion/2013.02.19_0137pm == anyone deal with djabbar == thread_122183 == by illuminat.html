				im trying to order some weed from him but he dosnt reply to messages, how do you order off this guy?<br />after two days it was marked in transit, five days later he hasnt told me if its ready to ship or told me to finalize before he ships,<br />I dont feel like finalizing before he tells me anything, do you just finalize after he marks in transit then wait till it shows up

				i wouldn&#039;t know about messaging vendors i&#039;m not a very demanding buyer at all so i just put in an order, check the status then wait for it to show. then finalise as soon as you get it. that&#039;s how escrow works on here. check his FE policy for new users or whatever level stats you have. if you&#039;re still not sure just message him with subject DO YOU WANT ME TO FE? that might get his attention. otherwise head to rumor mill or search his name. there&#039;s a lot of info on here. use it.

				yeah that too. try to avoid FE especially on international orders when your stats are low because if the seller decides to scam you and not send anything and they are established, SR resolution will usually side with the vendor. <br /><br />greenxchange put a link to your vendor profile in your forum sig! stoners can be really lazy&nbsp; :D
