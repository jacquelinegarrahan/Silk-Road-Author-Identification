				OK, I&#039;ll help. Transfer what bitcoins you do have into my account, I&#039;ll buy the product your after and send it to you after I get it and take out my portion. <br />Your welcome, I&#039;ve always believed in helping thy neighbor.

				I dont get it, that cant be a serious question. First of all, managing and procuring bitcoins are kind of a big part of running this site smoothly.<br /><br />60 bucks knocked you out, huh? You&#039;re problem isn&#039;t coins or being short on an order, your BIGGEST problem is you either didnt know how the transactions work or you just got wiped out and forced to beg for 60 bucks. Either way, here you are and im thinkin drugs of any kind may not be for you buddy. <br /><br />Oh, and yes im judging you. I could be wrong but im usually not so i judge a lot. <br /><br />If thats a joke comment.......shmeh, ive heard less funny ones i guess.

				No ones going to give you $60 in BTC man hahahah that&#039;s just not how it works around here.<br /><br />There is a spare coins thread, generally that&#039;s for people who are say 0.001btc short on postage and shizzle, most won&#039;t mind lending you small amounts for postage. I have done for others myself.<br /><br />We all work (legally / illegally) to earn our BTC to buy our drugs. Why the hell should we work to give you our cash lol<br /><br />Crazy man, no harm in asking, just expect the abuse to come flowing. People are not stupid on here, had some dude asking on multiple threads for small amounts&nbsp; of BTC, turned out he had NO money and even raised enough to make a small order. When it came to light a great number of people were really pissed. Its just not good karma man, buy your own frickin drugs!

				First of all, your name is HYDRO1993. This means you&#039;re what? 18? 19? <br /><br />So you probably don&#039;t have a job, since you&#039;re asking for 60$ worth. How would you pay it back?<br /><br />Another point, don&#039;t lend money to drug addicts. Drug addicts ask for money. Recreational drug users know how to allocate their resources to get what they want and responsibly use. You&#039;re still a teenager, learn2drugs yourself
