				hello. I bought two different vendors just the day of closing . buy in the morning and the closure was an hour or two later. orders are supposed to be sent . I am trying to contact the seller , I hope at least be honest and answer me . I finished the two shipments , because I&#039;m new user and so they asked me , spare me everything asked one of the vendors , who put into his terms. I fie because buyers spoke highly of them, and as I am new user compliance and trust in them. &#039;m todabia within llegen me two shipments , but in case of not arriving , I wonder if they got my money came when finishing orders as it should be sending me so shipments. you know if the money when finalizing an order will arrive directly to them and the money withdrawn or confiscated &#039;m closing day ? you think ? is to know how far I can ask them to send it to me , because if I see the money confiscated unfair to send it to me . regards veloc

				I&#039;d say if you ordered something on the very same day SR went down - you need to kiss your money AND the possibility of receiving your goods goodbye. <br /><br />at best, perhaps you can find the same vendor/s on some other marketplace and at least find out what happened... but that&#039;s about as positive it can get. no money, no drugs, no fun. <br /><br />...don&#039;t shoot the messenger.

				I&#039;d try to contact the vendor on the forums or another market.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t get your hopes too high, but you never know, they might show up.

				I wouldn&#039;t hold your breath, I&#039;m still waiting on my delivery and it&#039;s getting close to 4 weeks now...<br /><br />I have my own suspicions mine isn&#039;t coming sadly.
