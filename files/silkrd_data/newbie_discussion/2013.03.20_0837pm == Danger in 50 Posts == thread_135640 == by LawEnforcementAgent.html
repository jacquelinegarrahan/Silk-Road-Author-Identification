				Time of Flight TOR tracking.<br /><br />Is it possible that the time spent on the forum, getting through 50 posts, is fodder for LE to track us down? TOR is not foolproof--no system is. Look at DRM and the waste of money it has been, only hurting valued customers in the long run. Tracking TOR is not much different than tracing a phone line in the days of grey boxes or silver boxes--remember Ma Bell?<br /><br />Anyway... it&#039;s just my paranoid schizophrenia breaking through the psychotropic drugs. But seriously. 50 posts? And please don&#039;t just spam/troll my shit.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry so much. LE I&#039;m sure does know about this site, but I think there would just be too much time and resources invested if they monitored every single post ya know?

				It all come down to cost/benefit, as far as the US goes, must jurisdictions have a lot on their plates. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about time spent on the SR or forums. How many LEO&#039;s are actually competent enough to complete a deep packet inspection?

				It&#039;s not only deep packet inspection you gotta worry about... they can ask the ISP&#039;s who is connecting to known tor entrance nodes and then narrow down the search by seeing who was connecting to the nodes at the same time as when you were posting but they would literally have to look ask thousands of ISP&#039;s. Long story short unless they know the general vacinity of where your located, then know the will not be able to correlate between your user tag and you&#039;re physical location.

				Thanks for the thoughtful replies. I still have a long way to go as far as computer intelligence, but I think I&#039;m on my way. I posted a few thoughts of mine in my &quot;First Post&quot; here in the newbie section.<br /><br />One can never let their guard down too much......

				and this is why people don&#039;t take the time to write reviews which isn&#039;t helpful to the community or Newbies.<br /><br />Getting on and off as quickly as possible is what most people do.&nbsp; Others don&#039;t even know about the forums.&nbsp; Be smart and stay safe.
