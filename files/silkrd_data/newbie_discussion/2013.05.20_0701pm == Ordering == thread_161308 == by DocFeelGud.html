				You&#039;re supposed to actually encrypt your address with their PGP and send them the resulting encrypted text in that box. Depending on what software you&#039;re using, the process is different.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look up a tutorial on how to encrypt a message or text. Basically you&#039;ll make a .txt file with you info in it and after you&#039;ve got the software to memorize the vendor&#039;s public key, you encrypt the message using it.

				I think you only have to send your public key if your expecting something back that needs to be encrypted.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve never given my public with an order yet.<br /><br />I guess an example would be If I needed to confirm my address, I would send the vendor a pm asking to confirm my address, I would include my public key so they can send my address back encrypted then I can decrypt and check that its right.<br /><br />One more thing! (jackie chan adventures) you don&#039;t even need your own public key to encrpyt either just the vendors.&nbsp; When I first learned about pgp I thought I had to create my own public key to encrypt my info but I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; All you need is a pgp program and the vendors public key and your good to go.

				I&#039;ve always been confused on whether or not your suppose to send your public key to the vendor or not.<br /><br />From what i understand, You should only use encryption when giving sensitive information like your address. It takes time for a vendor to decrypt a message so it saves them time if you dont encrypt something that isnt necessary.&nbsp;

				Exactly, unless the vendor specifically asks for it, giving them more stuff to do or process only creates more work and who wants that...<br /><br />What I get confused about is when a vendor asks you to include more information with your address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was looking over a vendor profile that wanted extra information with the address, like product preferences, shipping box size etc and I wondered if I should encrypt my address and those details or just encrypt my address then put the details in the order box unencrypted.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would have messaged the vendor to ask but then I noticed something wonky on the profile page and decided to steer clear.

				I fucking love this blog. Okay. Just made my first order with catfish 916, but can&#039;t finalize. It says in Wiki the button should be next to the order. Any thoughts? I know I shouldn&#039;t FE, and I don&#039;t intend to in the future, but for such a small order with such a reputable tender, I&#039;ll make the exception. Where is the finalize button??

Whilst I understand the reasoning behind your desire to FE, it would be negligent of me not to state here that Silk Road recommends that buyers stay within the safety of the escrow system. If you do not, we can do nothing to help you in the event that something goes wrong.<br /><br />Libertas

				I&#039;ll tell you what this thread just reinforced that I&#039;m doing everything right as far as PGP goes this was very informative. I was unsure if i needed to include my public key but it makes perfect sense to only include it if the vendor is going to send you a sensitive message back. It&#039;s good to know that I am using the right technique! I also had some spare bitcoins tried the lotto with my dollar and didn&#039;t know how to finalize but just 20mins ago it was marked in transit and the finalize button appears! Both of these were my questions when I joined a few days ago! <br /><br />Good luck!
