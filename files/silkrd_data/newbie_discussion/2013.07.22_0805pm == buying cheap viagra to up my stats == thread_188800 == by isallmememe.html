				i want to order some shit from a seller but he requires me to have at least 5 orders. i only have 1 atm so i was thinking of buying some very cheap viagra gel sachets for 6 pence each. the postage is free as well. i don&#039;t even give a fuck if they don&#039;t turn up, i&#039;ll finalize and give 5/5 just for the stats. <br /><br />so is this worth me doing or will the seller with the shit i want see through it and likely refuse me still?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />also is there any reason why the gel sachets are so cheap? ..it says 6p on the listing and the postage says free first class. i take it there is no stealth way of getting a listing to show a low price and then have it charge more on sr<br /><br />this gel sachet seller doesn&#039;t exactly have the best stats and feedback, which is why i&#039;m just a touch cautious with this. this is example from his page...<br /><br />has been a vendor for 21 days<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 91% of sellers with 98.9% positive feedback from 37 transactions<br /><br />pill never arrived, i do beleive they were never sent. sad how he lied to get positive feedback.<br />Order cancelled. Vendor explained why. No problem<br />order cancelled no reason given<br /><br />he does have more good feedback however.<br /><br />any advice appreciated, thx

				there are a lot better ways to build up stats. look in the ebook section. i&#039;ve found ebooks for 0 BTC! it still counts towards your transactions. that won&#039;t help with the total spend however. you can try lotteries some have good odds. others are scams however so beware. some vendors may also require that you&#039;re a member for at least a month. best advice i can give is to find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require fe (if profile doesn&#039;t say anything send a pm) even for low/no stat members. that may mean paying a higher price but it&#039;s worth it if you can stay in escrow

				how is buying an ebook for 0btc better than buying the gel sachet for 0.0010btc?<br /><br />anyway, i really want this stuff from a certain seller who requires buyers to have had 5 transactions before buying from him. and i want to order tomorrow. all i want to know is would buying 4 very low price items give me that 5 transactions to enable me to order or would i be wasting my time. the seller doesn&#039;t mention a minimum sr spend. i&#039;m going to try anyway, i&#039;ll post back results

				couldn&#039;t agree more with your last two posts. i&#039;ve said your last post many times myself. i do still really want to order this shit tomorrow tho, and am not able to do 4 proper buys before then.<br /><br />i just bought an ebook. will get a few more if it works out ok. i will be making regular buys from now on as well, so in a few weeks my stats will look good anyway, the ebook buys will be totally diluted by then.

				I think vendors are more interested in how much you have spent rather that number of transactions.<br /><br />Lets say you bought 50 ebooks for 0.01 btc. That would come up as 50 transactions, 0% auto finalize and 0% refund. On the surface it looks like a good customer, but vendors can see your stats including the amount spent.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always thought vendors ought to put up a minimum spends before you have escrow. Putting up a good number of transactions might be a way for scammers to hit and run.<br /><br />And I agree with the vendor of two weeks not yet being &#039;trusted&#039;. Until a vendor sends out 30+ listing to established members, I&#039;d not buy anything myself. Its too easy for new vendors to set up dummy buyer accounts, praise their own product and then hit customers with FE demands.<br /><br />I would research any vendor by simply looking at the vendor page (recent feedback) and look at the forums for good reviews from established members who basically tell the truth over quality and so on.<br /><br />One other point....<br /><br />I notice that my spend stats have now just gone to a year. Spends before that are not there. Maybe this is an SR security thing and I guess the last years spends are good enough. I can only think its a security measure as some have been here almost two years I guess and if any LEA set up a seller accouint and tried to lure people in with free samples they would not see all the spends. Not that any resellers would go for free samples I guess. <br /><br />Good luck regardless.<br /><br />I think new members ought to expect to have to FE when they have no record to prove they are trustworthy. That takes time and coin!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				if i was a scammer with a seller account, not only would i set up multiple buyer accounts to give myself good cred. i would also set up multiple forum accounts and use them to blow my own trumpet as well.
