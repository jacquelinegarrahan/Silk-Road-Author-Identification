				What is the best way to research a vendor and product before making a decision.&nbsp; I have tried typing the vendors name into the search bar in Rumor Mill and that often doesn&#039;t come up with much or in some cases comes up with some error about me having searched within the last 5 seconds (I hadn&#039;t).&nbsp; For example, try searching the vendor &quot;chillzon3&quot; using the search box.&nbsp; Nothing comes up, even though I have later found many thread including his name.&nbsp; I had to then search more generically using the term &quot;UK diazepam&quot; but then wade through hundreds of posts to find specific info I am after.&nbsp; Is there no simple way to find a thread about a vendor?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t each vendor have one official thread which is linked to from the main SR site?<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m rambling, but if anyone could advise on their process of vetting vendors before purchasing that would be great.

				The search function on this forum doesn&#039;t always work, you have to search for the same thing a couple of times and then results will pop up. Sometimes the first time I type a vendor&#039;s name, only one thread is in the results, the next time there&#039;s none and after that there are a lot more..<br />You can also see the official review threads for each vendor on their page on SR, most of them have one and post the link to it in their profile.

				Thanks, that makes sense and is kind of what I suspected.&nbsp;
