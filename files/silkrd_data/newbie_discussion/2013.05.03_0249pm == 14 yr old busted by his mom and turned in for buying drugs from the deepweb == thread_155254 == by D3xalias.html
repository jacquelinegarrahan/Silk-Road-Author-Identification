				Source clearnet<br /><br />http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/fishers-teen-admits-buying-drugs-on-dark-net-hidden-online-market<br /><br />FISHERS, Ind. - A Fishers teen has been arrested after police intercepted two drug shipments that he admitted to buying on a growing online marketplace, found on a mysterious corner of the Internet known as the &quot;dark net.&quot;<br /><br />The 14-year-old boy&#039;s mother turned him in to police after the drugs arrived at her home with the day&#039;s mail.<br /><br />The mother cried as she told the Call 6 Investigators why she took the extreme step of hauling the boy and the drugs to the Fishers police station.<br /><br />&quot;My main concern was just to make sure I was doing everything I could to try to save his life, and I knew I couldn&#039;t do it on my own,&quot; she said under the condition that her family&#039;s identity be protected.<br /><br />&quot;I was mad at him, I think, disappointed for breaking my trust,&quot; she said as she wiped away tears.<br /><br />When police questioned the teen, he admitted to buying the drugs on a growing anonymous online portal known as &quot;Silk Road – The anonymous marketplace.&quot;<br /><br />A recent Forbes article pegged sales at $22 million annually on the Silk Road marketplace, with more than 550 sellers offering everything from drugs to guns and bombs.<br /><br />The Fishers mother said she became suspicious when her son kept anxiously checking the mailbox.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s like, &#039;I&#039;m just going to check the mail, I&#039;m just going to check the mail.&#039; You know, he doesn&#039;t typically want to check the mail all the time,&quot; she said.<br /><br />She waited for the next day&#039;s mail and grabbed an arriving Priority Mail package addressed to her son. When she opened it, she found a DVD cartoon movie box that heightened her suspicions even more. She bent the box open and said that a small sealed package dropped out in her lap.<br /><br />&quot;Inside of the sealed package was a baggie, zip lock baggie with clear, white crystals.<br /><br />&quot;I had no idea what it was. I knew it was a problem. He pleaded with me every which way to Sunday to dispose of it, throw it in the trash, flush it down the toilet, mix it with water, pour it in the mulch,&quot; said the mother.<br /><br />Instead, she loaded the drugs and her child into the car to turn them in.<br /><br />In court papers, Fishers police write that they tested the substance and confirmed it was Ecstasy, a form of MDMA, or methamphetamine.<br /><br />Under questioning, the boy said he had purchased those drugs, as well as a second shipment, from a seller on the Silk Road marketplace.&nbsp; Police then traced the second shipment and intercepted it on the neighborhood mail truck that was set to deliver once again to the family&#039;s home.&nbsp; The second shipment also contained drugs, police wrote.<br /><br />&quot;I was angry at the means with which he got his hands on these drugs,&quot; said the mother.<br /><br />Fishers police declined to answer questions about the case, so the mother said she wonders whether police are trying to track down the actual seller. The return address for each drug shipment was listed in Portland, Ore., but a slightly different male name was listed as the sender of each package.<br /><br />&quot;Whoever provided a child with the drug is anonymous,&quot; the mother said. &quot;It’s not like there was someone knocking at my door, it&#039;s not like he was out in the neighborhood, coming home acting differently. It was delivered straight to him in the mailbox.&quot;<br /><br />The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department reported a similar case of drugs arriving at an Indianapolis home. Narcotics Squad Capt. Robert Holt said a package of drugs was intercepted by police last fall and the recipient admitted having bought it on the Silk Road marketplace.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s out there. It&#039;s available,&quot; said Holt, adding that Ecstasy and other odd recreational drugs are the most common, such as the so-called &quot;date rape drug,&quot; as opposed to more commonly available drugs like marijuana and cocaine.<br /><br />The &quot;dark net&quot; is also known as &quot;dot-Onion,&quot; which refers to a domain that does not contain typical traceable dot-com websites. Instructional videos are posted on YouTube and elsewhere, telling people how to download a program that allows access to an anonymous technology called Tor. A recent GQ article traced its roots back to military intelligence operations trying to keep their communications from being intercepted.<br /><br />Once the Tor program is downloaded on a computer, it causes bits of data to be drawn from thousands of computers worldwide in order to establish a marketplace or web portal such as Silk Road. Since the site is not tied to a single computer or server like a dot-com web site, it creates serious challenges for police.<br /><br />Indiana State Police Cyber Crimes Unit&nbsp; Lt. Chuck Cohen said, &quot;What we find is there are online marketplaces on the dot-Onion or dark net or elsewhere, where they essentially act as auction houses for people to trade in illegal drugs and other kinds of illegal activities.<br /><br />&quot;Someone that is wanting to sell illegal drugs can use this to come in contact with someone who wants to buy illegal drugs. These are marketplaces like any other,&quot; he said.<br /><br />He said that, while tracing the communications or the actual transaction may be difficult in Silk Road drug cases, criminals can still be caught.

				What a fantastic mother. I hope someone locks her up.<br /><br />Long post (+K), but I managed to read it. Still, I wish they stopped with the conspiracy theories. I would like just ONE article to refer to this as deepweb, or simply Tor.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				And I just wanted to add:<br /><br />1. She sounds like she has a mental condition.<br />2. What about breaking HIS trust?<br />3. What the hell is &quot;dot-Onion&quot;? No, we do NOT call it that at all. Sheesh....<br /><br />4. WHO THE FUCK wrote this &quot;article&quot;? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?<br /><br />Worst article I have EVER seen on Tor/SR.

				&quot;A recent Forbes article pegged sales at $22 million annually on the Silk Road marketplace, with more than 550 sellers offering everything from drugs to guns and bombs.&quot;<br /><br />-pretty sure I can&#039;t buy guns or bombs, scare tactics I assume by the media<br /><br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s out there. It&#039;s available,&quot; said Holt, adding that Ecstasy and other odd recreational drugs are the most common, such as the so-called &quot;date rape drug,&quot; as opposed to more commonly available drugs like marijuana and cocaine.&quot;<br /><br />-so that&#039;s saying Ecstasy (which i somewhat believe) and odd recreational drugs are the most common? I highly doubt the &quot;date rape drug&quot; is one of the most common purchases on SR. the 2 drugs they mention aren&#039;t the most common, weed and cocaine, I would assume to be the 2 most ordered drugs. Weed definantly being the most sold. I could be wrong...

				&quot;save his life&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this woman understands how the legal system works. The kid would&#039;ve gotten high had some fun worked for some good honest money and that would&#039;ve been that. Instead she turns him in and actually ruins his life. I hate how brainwashed people are into thinking all drugs are bad. Sure some can fuck you up and others are dangerous if abused but it&#039;s a persons choice to do it. Drugs don&#039;t make bad people the laws surrounding them do. Makes me wonder what the world is coming to when a mother would do that to her own son out of ignorance. Disgusting shit. No wonder the kid was trying to catch a buzz.<br /><br />Reminds me of the other day. Was googling how to smuggle weed onto a cruise ship and all the replies to things were people bashing weed spreading propaganda and straight up saying don&#039;t. Motherfucker didn&#039;t ask all that he asked how to do it. People can be fucked up man. Such is life though. Lucky for me I even blaze with my mom&nbsp; :P

				Jesus, his own fucking mother sold him out to the police. She could have just thrown the fucking drugs away and then grounded him for a month.<br /><br />This is what I am saying guys. Misandry, the hatred of men, is so deeply brainwashed into American women, that they could care less even about their own sons.<br /><br />In America, women are NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MURDER THEIR OWN CHILDREN than the biological father.<br /><br />By promoting feminism, which promotes default custody to the mother, you are promoting the murder of children.<br /><br />How&#039;s that feel, all you feminists and manginas, to have the blood of all those children on your hands?

				I have a 14 year old son and the last thing I&#039;d do would be to turn him into the police. People are no longer raising their children, they are expecting others to do it for them. Many are thrown into day care at 6 weeks old and spend the majority of their life in school, organized activities, etc. <br /><br />One thing I&#039;m old fashioned about is having a parent at home. I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s the man or woman or one of the men/women but it&#039;s best for the child to have a parent around to actually raise them. Notice there&#039;s no mention of the father. She has no idea how to discipline her child so she lets the system do it for her - which of course will be 10x worse for this kid than the drugs would be.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be happy if my son was getting X through the mail but there is no way he would be able to do it without me or his mother knowing about it. I&#039;ve made sure he knows enough about computers that he could find SR if he wanted but I wouldn&#039;t be getting him bitcoins to spend like this mother did. If he did somehow manage to pull it off and I found out, we would have a serious and realistic discussion about drugs, and if my wife insisted, possibly a punishment from his parents, but not the cops.

She has no idea how to discipline her child so she lets the system do it for her - which of course will be 10x worse for this kid than the drugs would be.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be happy if my son was getting X through the mail but there is no way he would be able to do it without me or his mother knowing about it. I&#039;ve made sure he knows enough about computers that he could find SR if he wanted but I wouldn&#039;t be getting him bitcoins to spend like this mother did. If he did somehow manage to pull it off and I found out, we would have a serious and realistic discussion about drugs, and if my wife insisted, possibly a punishment from his parents, but not the cops.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This. I have two boys who aren&#039;t yet teenagers, (who I stay home to raise, btw -- I refuse to have strangers bring up my children) but having actually BEEN to jail myself, I could never delude myself into believing that sending my child to jail was somehow saving his life, or enriching it, or helping it at all. Not to mention, i met at least a half-dozen new connections in holding cells. put a bunch of drug users and criminals together, they&#039;re going to share tips and pointers on drug using and criminal activity.<br /><br /><br /><br />john rambo, what about the father? is he not responsible for his own damn self, taking care of his child? i really fail to see how the mother &#039;denies her son his right to a father.&#039; I dont know about MOST deadbeat dads, but my own was pretty selfish and never interested in his children&#039;s wellbeing. congratulations, you&#039;re the first person to make me wonder if there&#039;s an &#039;ignore&#039; button or list on this forum.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sour Grapes, the vast majority of kids who are growing up without a father is because the MOTHER forcibly removed the father from the child&#039;s life.<br /><br />85 percent of divorces are initiated by women. And we all know that women get default custody.<br /><br />You women CHOOSE to become single mothers. Why can&#039;t you women ever take responsibility for your own actions?

I&#039;ve done some mickey mouse time (9 months) myself when I was younger. Jail is just going to mess this kid up at that age, even for a short time. Wonder if the mother has the money to bail him out - sounds like either she doesn&#039;t have it or decided not to bail him. Just can&#039;t imagine turning a child into the police. It seems to go against the protective instinct to me. The thought of one of my innocent children in that environment is a nightmare I would do almost anything to avoid.<br /><br />BTW, thanks for doing the most important and most undervalued job in the world :)

				This article was written for a local news station in Indiana so you can&#039;t blame the writer for trying to appeal to their audience, even if it doesn&#039;t suit our tastes on this forum. <br /><br />&nbsp;His mother&#039;s a cunt but the kid isn&#039;t going to jail. Precincts let mothers take their kids in so they can make them hang out in a cell for 12 hours, then they have to go to court in a few months and receive 100 hours of community service. This provides an educational experience for the youngster and ostensibly some deterrent against upsetting his mother. My mother is also a cunt and might have done this when I was 14 so I can somewhat understand.<br /><br />But yeah this kids a damn fool upsetting his mother like that when he should be renting a PO box or something. If your mother&#039;s a cunt you don&#039;t do things like that<br /><br />&amp;lol at rambo congrats on the 50

				why shouldnt a 14 year old be doing MDMA? because it can fuck up memory after prolonged use? i am pretty sure the kid did his research on the shit and did not use for days straight whenever he got it. fuck, i probably did a gram of molly in one night (yes, stupid fucking idea...but i was at a party with some close friends) and about 200mg a dose. fucked up my memory for 2 days, then i remembered everything. and to the guy who said for me to watch out with methylone...i have not had much of a problem with it in the past. about a month ago i had 5g of it and finished it in a week with friends...i probably had over half of it myself. never have had a bad comedown from it. worst thing that has happened was nosebleeds for about 2 days due to low serotonin <br /><br />to IDoNotLikeProhibition....i am 15 and i honestly find what you said to be true. most kids these days are dumb as fuck..i for one am not one of those kids. after once incident with my mom almost finding my peeve, i quickly resolved that issue with a PO box...havent had a single bad issue come about since. if i got caught with a package, trust me...i could handle grown up things. lol...anyways, it is very easy to access SR considering it is all over youtube, the news and every fucking place you can think of. i have known of the darkweb for awhile now...thats how i found it, straight through the deepweb. found this a much easier way to get my products then with some sketchy ass street dealer. sad when i can trust people over the web more than i can trust someone face to face..

But they still don&#039;t get packages I didn&#039;t order for them yet. Besides, at a certain age you just have to accept you&#039;ve done your best to raise them and give them their freedom then hope they don&#039;t fuck up too much and just be there when they do fall. I&#039;d rather they trust me than spy on them. I think my family is heading for one of those situations where the child is more responsible than the adult anyway.<br /><br />Do be careful. Sorry, it&#039;s the parent in me. I know what stupid stuff you can do at that age with drugs - but mainly from experience so I guess that makes me a hypocrite. It does scare me a little to think there are children on here. I at least didn&#039;t have access to these amounts and variety at that age, in the time of dinosaurs and dial up AOL. Research, research, research. Always start off with a low dose with a new batch and work your way up. Be careful with any combinations. Addition sneaks up on you and can take years to fully bloom yet takes you by surprise. Your brain is still developing so it can have long term effects. Hopefully this is all stuff you&#039;ve heard a million times, so grandpa will shut up now.

				I try to put myself into this mom&#039;s position, and it&#039;s really hard to do. My own children aren&#039;t teens yet (thankfully), but I do remember what it was like to be a teenager. I would like to think that their mother and I are involved enough in the lives of our children that we would know if they were considering anything like this, and I&#039;d like to think that we are doing a good enough job at teaching/role modeling for them that they know about responsible behavior. Not just drug use, but life in general.<br /><br />The sad truth is since neither of us are psychic, I guess we&#039;ll never really know. When I was 15 I was just getting started in drug use. In hindsight, it was the only time I could have used drugs, but that time is really important for mental and social development, and I was too high most of the time to really pay much attention in school or to talk to other people my age unless we were talking about going and getting wasted or trying to talk while wasted. My parents knew what was going on, I found out about 10 years later that it really bothered my dad that I was doing all of that to myself, but he believed that the best way for me to learn about all of it was to try to handle it on my own, which seems to have worked. My younger sister on the other hand, never tried any hard drugs.&nbsp; She drinks, but I guess she saw me and learned from my actions.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that drug use is bad, this definitely isn&#039;t the place for that, nor is that really my belief anyway. What I do think is that a drug that alters your behavior should be used responsibly, and 14 year olds that are truly responsible are very few and far between. They simply don&#039;t have the advantage of time that allows them to comprehend the reality of what they are doing.<br /><br />That said, if I found a package addressed to one of my kids that contained some kind of drug in it, it would be a warning flag that tells me it&#039;s past time to talk to them.&nbsp; I&#039;d never turn them into the police, that would only alienate them. I&#039;d have to make up for lost time and find out why they want to do this. I probably wouldn&#039;t let them have it at 14, like I said, that&#039;s too young. A little older and just maybe I would let them trip under my supervision. I would want to be there to make sure dosages are correct, and that they couldn&#039;t hurt themselves while under the influence. No, I wouldn&#039;t do it with them, I&#039;m not trying to be the &quot;cool&quot; dad that gets high with their kids (I don&#039;t care for not having control of my body any more, I don&#039;t even drink more than a couple glasses of wine or a beer), but I care so I would want to keep them in the house

Funny thing is not a single time, not once did my dad ever ask me to stop using drugs. He just talked to me about changing my behavior with regards to other people.

				14 is way too young to be fucking around with hard drugs. But it&#039;s also something that our society portrays in the mass media as desirable for kids to do, so they can&#039;t have it both ways.<br />&nbsp; Shows like &#039;Weeds&#039; and &#039;Ideal&#039;, Cheech and Chong movies and all the rappers harping on about getting high send a message to youth that it&#039;s great fun on drugs. The government then tax and allow thesee products of communication so they&#039;re as much to blame as the SR, the vendor and the kid.<br />Did you know it&#039;s actually illegal to teach people how to take drugs? So therefore David Geffen and Rupert Murdoch should be arrested as well since they own the media that plays movies which contain graphic depictions of drug taking and are thereby instructional tutorials.<br />At least the kid didn&#039;t die huffing a paint can whilst Robotrippin&#039;, because he couldn&#039;t score from the street.<br />Also there&#039;s no guns and bombs for sale on SR.

				yes, i lost memory of that night for 2 days...every other memory is fine. yes, i was a stupid fuck for that night. never again will i be that stupid. learned from my mistake, learned from friends mistakes. and so what if a 14 or 15&nbsp; year old uses drugs? yes, our brains are still developing...but everyone has a choice to do drugs or not. some people are stupider that others and do stupid shit. my only stupid mistake was that gram of molly used within a night. i have been smart with everything besides that one little thing. im not going to judge someone for doing drugs no matter at what age..it is their choice and i can not stop them from that choice nor will i try. i hate it when people try and control me, so i am not going to try and control anyone else.<br /><br />P.S. i rarely use any drugs anyways due to the fact that it is such a hassle for me to even get them. think the last time i had anything was over a month ago..

				That&#039;s what happens when a desired and available good becomes prohibited based on nothing but nonsense. Mdma is less likely to harm him than getting ludicrously drunk, he is less likely to commit anti social crimes under the influence of mdma (vastly so) but if mummy walked on him stinking drunk I bet she would have passed it off as boys being boys and handled it in house like a sensible human would have. <br /><br />Dealers don&#039;t often give a fuck how old someone is and this site by its nature is anonymous. So this is as much the fault of the bogus war on drugs as anything. <br /><br />That said please kid learn never talk to the cops. I know its scary and you&#039;ve just been sold out by your own mother but the cops are never ever ever your friend and never to be trusted.

				So it&#039;s a family of retardation. It would seem the male figure had the smarts to dip out on her before she took him down to the station to report a rape because he had a nocturnal emission that turned into a son. I never thought I was THAT crafty as a kid, but I DEFINITELY wouldn&#039;t spam check the mail for a package knowing damn well I never ask to check the mail normally. Especially when it seems his mommy had to hand hold him all the way out of the house any time he checked. On that note, what kind of mother fucks their child&#039;s ENTIRE LIFE over some chemical? Fuck christ. Ground him. Beat his ass for not being smart about it. Take his internet access away! But first, BE A FUCKING PARENT! Too may people are afraid to discipline their children, and as such, the world is going to be filled with undisciplined, ignorant, and downright disrespectful people. <br /><br />YOU are the parent, not the police. You have now ruined your child&#039;s life forever. You, ma&#039;am, deserve to be euthanized.

I knew what LSD was and knew I wanted to try it by the time I was in 5th grade.

I wouldn&#039;t go so far to say this article is doctored, but I do agree kids shouldn&#039;t use drugs. If not for childhood innocence reasons, just because the brain isn&#039;t fully developed until late adolescence, some claim not even until the early 20&#039;s. In my ideal world, drug use &quot;can&quot; begin at 16, as that&#039;s about the time from what I understand most people agree the brain is fully developed, but then again that can be my own bias coming through as I didn&#039;t begin my foray into drug use until late 16.<br />i honestly could believe this story considering when i was 14 (which was only like a year ago) i got into the darknet. once i found out of the darknet i was hooked on everything on it... this place is much more interesting than anything on the clearnet and also much more interesting than playing a fucking 360 or ps3. i access SR and many other sites i come upon that interest me in my free time at home. and since i was about 11 i have been researching many different drugs...the main one that has always interested me was MDMA. always wanted to get my hands on some and try it out, and that experience happened 3 years later. hell, i have been so fascinated by MDMA that i have done numerous school projects on the drug and my teachers congratulate me on how much detail, time and research i have put into the projects. and i am sure there are many other kids that are just like me who research drugs and are fascinated by drugs. and i am sure there are kids who are fascianted by the darknet also. hell, i have a good friend i met a fucking school this year who is into the same shit as me...drugs, darknet, experimenting...etc. just like this kid here in this article, i am sure he did his research before doing any type of drug like most smart people would do. he also took this risk of sending it to his house...i am once again having to do the same thing now that i no longer have a PO box for use. if any of my packages get caught by anyone, LE or my bitch of a mother, i am willing to take on any of the consequences that come with the illegal substance. <br /><br />i am just wondering why many people on here look down upon kids for using drugs when i am sure that over 50 percent of the &quot;grown ups&quot; on this site started as kids. it is our choice to make, if you do not like the choices we make, then fuck you. :) haha. one thing i can understand of the people on here looking out for us kids these days is the fact the only place we really have to send is our own house where our parents live and will possibly get our mail and open it before we do. but knowing that most of the vendors on this site have some pretty bad ass stealth, i never really worry of my parents finding anything. and if they do, it would be my mother and all she would do is be dissapointed in me or possibly not even care and just take the substance, flush it, and tell me to be careful.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Today, the access and knowledge out there is even more extensive; you would probably be stunned by what 14 year olds get into now.<br /><br />As for this story, that is just fucked up. If I caught my son doing this shit, I would be flushing the drugs while he watched and then I would confiscate his computer for at least the next year. He wouldn&#039;t be doing a damn thing without my direct supervision. He knows damn well what my policy is towards drug use as a teenager in my house. But bringing him to the cops? That&#039;s just bullshit. Way to fuck up your kids even more. Also, where did you get the money? Does his mom have no clue or what? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this backs me up a little here. this guy was doing shit at 14 before access to this shit was as easy as a click of a button on a computer. <br /><br />also silver, this story is fucked up for someones own parent fucking up their childs life in means of &quot;helping&quot; them. <br />as a teenager myself i try my best not to fuck up to badly with drugs at this age...and so far i have not fucked up<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I was doing a lot of drugs as a teenager, screwed me up for a long time; where I am from it was everywhere, all the time. Of course, nearly everyone in my family was also a drug addict of some type. We didn&#039;t have as many designers as there are available now but weed, acid, and coke were always available and cheap. Then again, as a female, I didn&#039;t pay for a single drug until well into college.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />most of the designer drugs out there today i would NEVER touch. especially the things that are sold legally inside head shops. the &quot;bath salts&quot; stuff...big waste. pretty much paying $60-$80 for a little half gram container of life or death. i find it a little sad when i can trust something illegal more than i can trust something that is legal.<br />people just want to make their money with all of this legal bullshit out there and could care less if their product kills 100 teenagers...people in this age are fucking sick..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re the guy talking about doing mephedrone, methylone, a-pvp and RCs.&nbsp; What exactly do you think is in &quot;bath salts.&quot;&nbsp; Things like mephedrone, methylone, mdpv or any other RC mixed with inactive filler.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yes, i know what was in bath salts..even then i still would not do them because i do not know how much of one chemical is inside one 100mg line of the white powder. meph alone is great, methylone alone is great, and a-pvp alone is great. would never combine them with anything. as long as i know what i am consuming and how much of that RC i am consuming...i am fine. MDPV...never going back to that again. store bought bath salts is what i would never do...chemicals from in them...yeah..will possibly do.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This mother hurted her son much more than MDMA could do.<br />I remember my mom concerns when she discovered i smoke weed, she educated herself about weed, then she planted 6 healthy plants for me. This way ill not go out to the street to buy drugs. She became my home-grown dealer. I remember (laughing right now) her watering the plants and taking care. Lol<br /><br />But the real meaning of the 14yo story is, what if he got some nbome or heroin or any fatal substance. He could end his life, right? Now thats really a big drama.<br /><br />SR cant filter teenagers, maybe thats something bitcoin dealers can do, like mtgox, liberty reserve, wm-center, etc... They must not sell bitcoins to teenagers, this is a big responsability.

				What a dumb bitch. She unwittingly has implicated herself in the event that any future transactions would occur.&nbsp; After all they don&#039;t KNOW it was HER SON and NOT HER.&nbsp; The US government does not play house, and it certainly does not play favorites.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now her story and her son are immortalized online as MDMA (Meth...lol..)&nbsp; druggies.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure his future employers will find this article with how well things are databased now.<br /><br />He should&#039;ve knocked her to the ground and threw the shit away.&nbsp; He probably would&#039;ve gotten in trouble for that as well, but the lack of evidence would be enough to not implicate both parties.

				How silly to go check the mail box and tell your mother you are going to check to mail box.<br />Just say I am going to visit Johnny down the street see if his home and want to play XBOX.<br />Then check the mail. If nothing is there say to the mother Johnny was not home or something like that.<br /><br />And 14 years is way to young to start going X. Can screw up his life really really good. Just wait till college or senior high school or what ever.
