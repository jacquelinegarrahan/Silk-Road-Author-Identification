				ALL Vendors should be allowed to post without all the 50 posts silly games.<br /><br />New Vendors ESPECIALLY Should have access so to be able to announce their new products and services. This 50 post thing is a detriment to furthering said vendors businesses.<br /><br />Also new vendors are often targeted by scammers. Having access to all the forums would aid in the prevention of this by being able to share their situations and gain knowledge and insight with other than newbies. <br />Oh well.... At Least I got another past!<br />SprayMan<br />

				agreed. <br />snake bites its tail because you are only being confirmed as a vendor in the forum if you have:<br />6weeks membership, <br />turned around 1500$, <br />received your bond refund, <br />use the same username as on SR<br />have a link to your shop in your forum signature.<br />&nbsp;<br />Plenty of time to spam the forum, if you are impatient. <br />I didn&#039;t and am waiting three days now to access the vendor forum although I messaged inigo. <br />Would love to participate discussion although I dont have 50posts. <br />There are interesting discussions in the other boards but only very little for me in newbie and customer support.
