				Heh. So here&#039;s my odd dilemma. <br /><br />I ordered some sweet stuff from a brand new vendor. nothing arrived after weeks and weeks, and the other 2 people who bought from him were saying the same thing. <br /><br />Now i got this package about 3 weeks late.. I don&#039;t know why but something about it is off. The package is really greasy, smells like oil.<br /><br />For some reason i can&#039;t get it out of my head that it could be anthrax in there.&nbsp; ??? <br /><br />Lol if i open it i die!.... Many cases of people sending out anthrax on SR? lol. I think i&#039;m overthinking it.<br />

				the sweet stuff is molly.<br /><br />anthrax doesn&#039;t necessarily look any different than M. So i don&#039;t know. And yes i hope we don&#039;t have new vendors selling anthrax.<br /><br />ODD thing is this vendor made LOADS of listings for everything with a white power form SPEEED, MOLLY, COKE,. He was a new vendor.<br /><br />How much would it cost him to make 10G of anthrax i wonder because the bag does weigh up right lol<br /><br />

				Hah, you&#039;re probably fine dude. If anything you probably just got ripped off and it&#039;s bunk but I guess you can&#039;t really tell until you try it. To be honest though, these kind of things are why I stick with already known and well-established vendors.&nbsp; :P

				ROFL i don&#039;t really think it............ but there are some odd things about this.. especially being a new vendor.<br /><br />poison has been sent out on SR early stages.. Really there&#039;s no way to tell til i open it or wait for a reply from SR staff to see if the 2 other buyers have got theirs and opened it haha... i will prob open it and cover my mouth, then test it on a open wound that way i don&#039;t die if i inhale or ingest it lol.<br /><br />And ya Bokchoy this was a risk i took with this vendor. There was no one else with remotely comparable prices at the time. I took a risk and got a 100% refund. I won&#039;t be taking the risk again because in the beginning i didn&#039;t think that anthrax may come lol.

				Oh, okay.&nbsp; PHEW!&nbsp; I thought you seriously suspected anthrax for some reason!<br /><br />Also, you&#039;ve already received a 100% refund?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t think it seems right, and you&#039;ve already received a 100% refund, you might want to consider just not taking a chance with it.

				Just so you know they have an antibiotic to treat anthrax poisoning so in the unlikely event you get it maybe you could order some of the antibiotics from SR as well? <br /><br />Just a thought, as far as i know people don&#039;t just get dusted with anthrax and then die right there over the box/letter.

				I had a good chuckle because of this thread, I cannot thank you enough. I can&#039;t help but wonder who in their right mind would take their time to send you anthrax? I couldn&#039;t imagine a vendor, even how big, getting his hands on a biological weapon. Especially the kind that causes acute disease. Even most notorious and wanted terrorist organizations have a very hard time on getting their hands on biological weapons. Even if at all. It would probably be easier to acquire a nuclear weapon (maybe a suitcase nuke?) than to acquire large quantities of anthrax, especially the kind that were sent out to high social and political figures on 9/11, which I think Is the kind you are talking about? As far as I know, to weaponize anthrax you&#039;d need a military grade laboratory (level 3-4 biosafety category) that could be distributed into envelopes and sent out to random people. The risk is too high and the outcome would be too little, I&#039;d understand if you were a major force in the media or the politics. No offense, maybe you are, I don&#039;t know -- but I tend to think those two wouldn&#039;t be using Silk Road forums. Unless he sent you a dead anthrax infected pig. But I suppose there might be someone out there crazy enough, I just don&#039;t think they&#039;d be using Silk Road or have any want or need to start killing random drug users, anthrax or not, it&#039;s all business. Plus I&#039;d imagine a gram of anthrax would be more expensive than fifty grams of MDMA (probably way off) so I don&#039;t think the vendor would be wasting thousands of dollars just to kill some random guy. It&#039;s good to be cautious just don&#039;t jump to assumptions when you haven&#039;t even opened up the package, this thread could damage the vendors reputation greatly. Like someone before me said, If I were you, I&#039;d pay the man what you owe. <br /><br />And maybe next time when buying something from Silk Road you should consider investing towards a level 3 or maybe even 4 biosafety laboratory? Don&#039;t forget to buy several hazmat suits, and a chemical decontamination shower, maybe two. <br /><br />Anthrax is an &#039;overrated&#039; biological weapon anyway, find a way to weaponize tularemia - as far as I&#039;m aware, there is no &#039;general&#039; vaccine available to treat it, unlike anthrax or smallpox, which can be treated if they are caught early. <br /><br />I do wonder, out of curiosity how much would a gram of anthrax go for on the black market? <br /><br />~ Cooler.

				This is SO ridiculous, reeki789, REALLY! <br /><br />Could it be that ur from the US? lol<br />They´re media is poisoned with articles and shows about that. And as a person before told, why the heck should someone send anthrax and the better question would be: From where should he get it from?<br /><br />Telling this is just not good, my opinion... :-/

				I can&#039;t believe nobody has said this, but if anyone seriously believes they&#039;ve been sent harmful agents instead of MDMA then they&#039;re most likely suffering from a bout of amphetamine psychosis due to abusing the shit for too long.<br /><br />Lay off speed-related substances for a few months, stick to booze, coke and maybe the occasional joint. Too much of a good thing can cause mental health problems!
