				Search &quot;local bitcoin&quot; on the clearweb. It will give you lists of BTC sellers in your area. I meet my BTC dealer at Starbucks. He knows me as John and that is all he knows or wants to.

				Whether or not that guy is a scammer, I have had some good experiences with localbitcoins too. clearnet search that. My local bitcoin guy knows me as John too, that guy won&#039;t even give me a name, not even a fake one. I like him :p

				DONT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYONE YOU COME ACROSS SR, OR THE FORMS. <br />Simply go to localbitcoins.com and find a reputable person to do business with. I was in the same boat as you, and i found the best guy possible through localbitcoins.com. I simply put money in his BOA account and within 20mins i have my BTC in my wallet. I don&#039;t do 10k a week but i hit 5k easily every week and the transactions go smooth. PLEASE DON&#039;T GET SCAMMED THROUGH THESE TROLLS ON THE FORMS..<br /><br />goodluck<br />-420

				If anyone is in need we are in the process of selling bitcoins below market value! We need to liquidate to pay some electrical bills so we are looking to let off some of our load.<br /><br />We can accept western unioin, money gram, cash to PO BOX, blank money order to PO BOX, Direct bank transfer depending on your location. We have done quite a few successful transactions with loyal and trusted customers and are looking to expand. We currently just moved some coins into a middle coin wallet for this week we will sell to honest and reputable buyers/vendors that are looking for coins, minimum $1,000 USD maximum $8,000 per transaction. Thanks for your time and hope everyone is enjoying there weekend!
