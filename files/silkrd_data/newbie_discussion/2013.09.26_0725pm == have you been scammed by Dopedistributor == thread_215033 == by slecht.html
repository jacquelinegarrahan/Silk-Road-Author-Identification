				Thankfully i didn&#039;t FE, i refused when he/she asked but seen at least 100 other people had. That started the alarm bells ringing in my head. Its all very well having a 4.9/5 rating, but when that&#039;S built on feedback that reads &quot;finalized early as requested&quot; it doesn&#039;t mean shit.<br />i only ordered 1g but he had listings for kilograms so other buyers may have lost loads, for those peoples sake i so hope i&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />slecht

				I think people just feel like it will never happen to them. And then it does, and you are out some money, and then you join with the rest of us and tell everyone you can to never FE.

				It&#039;s a shame that people take advantage of FE, as a noob here I&#039;m learning that the hard way. As a former ebay seller, I understand vendors frustration with waiting on lame buyers that wait the whole auto finalize waiting period even though they have received their products days ago. It&#039;s so hard to re up, when you&#039;re waiting on all these orders to process so it really is a bummer especially with new vendors and buyers flooding the market everyday i can only hope the SR family stays together for many years to come. As a community we really need to think of a solution to this, because legit vendors from the other side of the pond are losing alot of business for requesting FE on international orders. I can understand why they need FE because customs can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks and its really just not fair you know?
