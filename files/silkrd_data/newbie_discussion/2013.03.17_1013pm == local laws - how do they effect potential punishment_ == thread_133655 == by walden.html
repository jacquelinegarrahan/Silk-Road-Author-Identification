				Hi all,<br />I&#039;m totally new to this. I&#039;m planning on purchasing weed once I&#039;m comfortable with the way everything works. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how local laws come into play if you get caught... I live in a &quot;decriminalized&quot; state so under an oz is at most a fine and they take it away... would getting caught with less than an oz in the mail be the same deal? Or are there federal/USPS &quot;laws&quot; that could mean more serious consequences? <br /><br />I understand that it&#039;s very unlikely that they&#039;ll go after anyone for less than an oz of weed, but I&#039;m curious how much weight local laws have in the matter.

				For one never sign for anything. 99% of the time you won&#039;t have to but sometimes vendors mess up and make you sign for it. Just read reviews and make sure noone talks about signing for it.<br /><br />If the package is intercepted they&#039;ll either send you a letter or do a controlled delivery, where law enforcement will try to make you sign for it OR they will watch the package in your mailbox, wait for you to take it out, and possibly raid your house.<br /><br />This is all worst case scenario, usually vendors vacuum seal bags and make sure they are very stealthy. You shouldn&#039;t have to worry about it being intercepted. If you are feeling very paranoid however, just bring the package into your house, quickly write RTS on it (return to sender) and leave it sitting there. You can NEVER get in trouble for mail sent to your house unless you open it. If you write RTS on it then you take it to court, claiming you have no knowledge of it.<br /><br />The only way you&#039;ll get in trouble is if you open your mouth before talking to your lawyer. You can easily get off with plausible deniability. <br /><br />~TLDR I recommend reading up on the WIKI or buyer guides on the forums. You will learn everything you need to and it will put these thoughts at ease.

				Relax bro. You&#039;re not getting &quot;caught&quot; unless you&#039;re ordering half a key of MDMA or blow. They&#039;d just confiscate it IF that. 99.987% chance you won&#039;t have any issues. Now relax and order away. :)
