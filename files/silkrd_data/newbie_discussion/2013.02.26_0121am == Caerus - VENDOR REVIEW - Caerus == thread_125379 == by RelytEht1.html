				I recently purchased an ounce of Purple Cheesle (Purple Kush x Cheeze x Sour Diesel I believe) from Caerus using his limited time offer $200 deal. I placed the order on a Thursday Night and it arrived Tuesday and the packaging was superb and not suspicious whatsoever (priority not express). It was vacuum sealed TWICE which&nbsp; made it have no smell. The product itself was very good and very smelly with a tight trim and the weight was on point (28 Grams). I couldn&#039;t be happier and it was only $200 (usually $300+ from where I live). I am a new buyer and this is my first purchase and I am definitely sticking with this vendor (Caerus) when purchasing in the future, or at least until he sells out of good product or raises his prices. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for high quality product for good prices and&nbsp; he did not require me to FE as a new buyer which was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Caerus!&nbsp; :D

				Agree. I ordered Caerus&#039; Cookies the other day, had one last night and was floored. Started with a half, waited an hour, felt it a little bit, ait the other half and BAM toasted me, but in an active type of way. Instead of the couch lock i get from being TOO high, it made me move around and seriously laugh my ass off...<br /><br />Would love to do business again and definitely will.<br /><br />Next for me would be his OZ or QP.......waiting for him to reload.<br /><br />

				This guy is a serious professional. Response was prompt when I asked a question, and he was kind, courteous and helpful, which you don&#039;t always get on the road. I haven&#039;t yet gotten that GDP(it ships on Monday), but I have never been so excited for anything in my life. He gives good descriptions of his products and I LOVE the HD pictures- they get me drooling. I will update once I receive my product, but I can tell that this vendor is honest and expect nothing short of the top-notch he promises. I will definitely be returning.&nbsp; :D

				Recent buy: Limited OZ special. priority mailed.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ordered on Saturday, vendor sat with order until Monday which is fine. 5 days later and today is friday, apparently priority mailed at 8 am. Still absolutely nothing in the mail and still absolutely nothing from Caerus after a day of asking where and what is happening. This is the slowest domestic shipment I think I&#039;ve ever had. If there was any communication besides one message 5 days ago I would have a lot better things to say. Just very disappointed considering I have family members with extreme pain, they&#039;ve been without medicine this whole week now. Will update if it arrives tomorrow but, I mean so far things look bleak.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />__________________________________________<br /><br />Total transactions: 37<br />Total spent: $3352.36<br />Refund rate: 0.16%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months

Placed the same order Friday, received a message Saturday stating it was shipped. Mail came through today and still no package. Wouldn&#039;t be as big of a deal if there was more communication like he states on his vendor page. Shows that he has been active on SR today, but has not read my message to him requesting the DCN like he states on his vendor page, or any information at all regarding the package. <br /><br />It appears that another buyer received their order today and has left new feedback regarding the Promo OZ. Seems the buyer had the same issues as we are, but the quality is high.<br /><br />I hope to hear from Caerus soon, as their reputation is solid. It&#039;s just unfortunate when a Vendor gets so bogged down that they are unable to keep communication lines open. I&#039;ve seen it time and again.&nbsp; This kind of reminds me of a problem I had with a vendor named Mr. Yellow. He had a pretty solid rep until he got too big. Mr. Yellow blamed his time lag on a tropical storm which was legitimate and bought him a few extra days. Only, Mr. Yellow was actually communicating with his clients at the time, and continued lying about DCN&#039;s, shipping times, etc. Regardless of his efforts to get caught up he got in over his head with too many orders, and was kicked from the site. Although, I received my product from him, there were many others that just flat out didn&#039;t receive anything. SR admins did some investigating of their own, and decided it was justifiable to ban him.<br /><br />Not saying that this is Caerus&#039; prerogative by any means, just that shitty things can happen on the Road. It always seems to get worse when there&#039;s a major shift in BTC too. Anyway, hopefully in the next couple of days we hear from Caerus and everything is a-ok.<br /><br />TurpenT

				Hey, guys. Sorry I*ve been unresponsive. I*m going through all PMs now and will respond to everyone within an hour or so.PM me with a PGP key if you need the tracking number. If your package has been delayed let me know and you will receive&nbsp; 20% of your current order amount on your next one. <br /><br />Orders placed within within a few hours right before the crash and during the time MtGox was down and the later DDOS will be cancelled. 50 of them. All at 200-250 USD/BTC. I was gonna honor all orders at 80 dollars per BTC loss, but with btc at 75, after paying off my suppliers, I will have to pay 20-30k friom my pocket if I were to fulfill all order. If any of you bought their coins at over 200 I will honor your order if you have a proof of purchase. <br /><br />Thanks for your patience.

				Yep received notification from our favorite, but busy vendor. Looks like everything is on the up n up, and there&#039;s nothing to worry about. Just a little backlog due to BTC. <br /><br />Thanks for the update Caerus!
