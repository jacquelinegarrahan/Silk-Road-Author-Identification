				Unless your a vendor, ya don&#039;t need to publicly list it. Just send it to a vendor if you need him to send YOU an encrypted message. It&#039;s more important that you have his key so you can send your name/address to him encrypted.

The most important thing to encrypt is YOUR shipping info, ..name, addy, etc, and to do that you need his public key, he don&#039;t need yours. If you do need to get him yours, you can just PM it to him.

Generally we don&#039;t encrypt most of our conversations. We (should) ALWAYS encrypt any personal info. The other conversations can&#039;t harm us unless they connect it to you personally. Also vendors don&#039;t want to deal with encrypting/unencrypting non-sensitive information because it is time consuming. <br /><br />So if want to ask a question about the product it doesn&#039;t need to be encrypted. It is already public knowledge that &quot;VendorJohn&quot; sells this product.<br />You are ready to order and send the vendor your address. This NEEDS to be encrypted. This insures no one but the vendor can read your message.
