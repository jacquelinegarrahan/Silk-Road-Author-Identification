				BTC is trying to figure out its true value now but it will go up just not as rapidly or to the $250+ range overnight. It will gradually climb once this dust settles. <br />When the new Asic miners were released miners that had tons of BTC sold them. This was to pay for their new mining machines. The increase in value caught the eye of those looking to make a quick buck but also those that hadnt heard about BTC before thus raising the interest and the value. Then after people grabbed up BTC thinking it would keep going up those in the know started dumping it. BTC holders tried to influence the market to keep it up but as it started to drop TONS of new BTC holders panicked and sold. LTC went up and down with the BTC but no where near as high as BTC.<br />If you havent heard of it yet check out BTC-e.com<br />I dont even bother with Gox anymore.

				Hello, <br /><br />Do you both know a lot about bitcoins? From your posts, it sounds as if you do...would either one of you be willing to help me to try and get a better understanding of how these work?<br />I would really appreciate it.<br /><br />Thank you in advance
