				I am not aware of the standard price on SR.<br />It looks a bit expensive but i think it is because the bitcoin/usd rate right now is super high !<br />Lets say i want to buy an item i see right now listed at 10 BTC. Is it 10 BTC calculated with the current exchange rate or the exchange rate when the item post was created?<br /><br />Since a month ago, BTC was twice as cheap, there is no way i am going to buy a item for which the price has doubled !<br /><br />Hope i am clear, english is not my 1st tongue.<br /><br />

				Short answer: yes.<br />Not as short answer: I don&#039;t know how SR calculates the exchange rate, but it&#039;s often enough.&nbsp; One product that I bought for B0.84 ten days ago is down to B0.71 and I&#039;m sure the vendor hasn&#039;t done anything.

				atuye is correct :)<br />If you are talking about the recent skyrocket in the BTC price I think you may mean deflation :), sorry I see English is not you&#039;re native tongue, I am just a nitpicker! :P

				Most listings are pegged to the US dollar, so they cost the same no matter the BTC price. You&#039;ll notice the ones that aren&#039;t when the prices are stupidly high all of a sudden.

				Yes, most pegged to the U.S dollar, so they adjust with Bitcoin inflation/depreciation

				believe its down to the vendor and what they choose to trade in, most sensible vendors will trade in dollars in which case the BC price will fluctuate as mentioned

				I&#039;ve personally been following a vendor with over 10 products.&nbsp; As the price of bit coin fluctuates their price changes.&nbsp; It is hedging, I suppose?&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that is the correct term.&nbsp; It seems automatic.&nbsp; Though I have no idea.&nbsp; To me the prices here when purchased in personal quantity rival any street value.

				Most items are like the above members said, But what i dont actually get is about the shipping costs. Even if prices of products are shown in USD the shipping costs is shown on BTC.. so is this price also fixed accordin to exchange rate / value of BTC? or its is a standar BTC aount that could be tricky enough to pay a lot for shipping...

				The vendors can decide whether to market their products by their dollar amount or by Bitcoin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to see a vendor selling &quot;By the Bitcoin&quot; instead of a predetermined dollar amount.&nbsp; I think I remember hearing that the prices are adjusted every 30 minutes to an hour.

				top44, I&#039;ve noticed the same thing about the shipping price too. 0.3BTC is fine when the bitcoins were around $25 each, but now they&#039;re getting close to double that and the shipping cost stays the same? Hmmm, it really is like eBay!
