				I got 3 packages one day. I just want to know if any experienced people out there have had issues with this or if I should spread out ordering. I appreciate any advice.

				ive done 7 in one time. i thnk about 5 came at one. all you need to say is I fix broken iphone. or it;s some cables or a bit for my computer. I use ebay a lot. spready out makes sense. i live in a place were anyone could take my package but know one does so far (touch wood lol). if anything did go astare i would use PO or another location work can be a a good one depending whos hands it goes into and not too much attention is drawn. anything smeely obviously not small things like trips and powders maybe pills and caps. its all about good stealth&nbsp; normal they call they all kinds of things and you just go with i didnt ask for this. it&#039;s a set up.<br /><br />NN

				I wouldn&#039;t be to worried. At one point I got carried away and ended up with 5 packages coming at once. In my opinion as long as you have it so you don&#039;t have to sign for your package you will be ok. I&#039;ve never ordered anything that I would have to sign for. It&#039;s just my way of protecting myself. I know that if they ask me to sign for something that I ordered off here then its a controlled delivery.

				If your worried go ahead and actually start a little repair services or something where packages would go in and out a lot. I am sending and receiving multiple packages all the time, I don&#039;t think the mail staff would even notice if I had multiple weed orders show up in a day. They know I buy broken lots and things and would just say &quot;So, were not going to see you on the porch again until I pick these all up I bet&quot; I&#039;ll say yeah, but just leave out the part about me being inside glued to the couch instead of in the shop working, lol.
