				Hi, I&#039;m new and about to take the plunge.&nbsp; I have a friend who used bit instant a lot so I was going to order through there but I&#039;ve been seeing that people having been saying that some people are getting selectively scammed.<br /><br />Is it still safe to use bit instant and if I use it through tor will me order get flagged or can I use it through tor?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t using it through the clean net defeat the whole purpose of using fake information?&nbsp; Does anyone of any other suggested places for ordering bitcoin?<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on ordering from XXXotica since they seem to be a good dealer.

				If you feel uneasy about bitinstant, use moneypak transfers via SR vendors. there are a lot of really trustworthy vendors who will give you instant BTC for a moneypak code (its like a prepaid card you load with cash at any store)

				For some reason I keep getting repeated logged out of the SR main website and having to log back in.&nbsp; Even after having just logged in.&nbsp; Is SR getting attacked or does this mean someone else has accessed my account and I should use a different one?

I&#039;ve only done it three times (fairly new to this whole thing) but each time it&#039;s worked like a gem. Even a couple times I&#039;ve bought large amounts of coins (~$300 worth) and it&#039;s all come through to my BlockChain wallet without a problem. I have heard of people not getting their coins right away from Bit Instant, though they always seem to get them eventually, after contacting support and following through. I honestly wouldn&#039;t be too worried about Bit Instant scamming you, they&#039;re a pretty legit organization.<br /><br />Hope this helps&nbsp; :)

				If anonymity buying bit coins is a worry, use TOR and use bitinstant and send your bitcoins to email. (The email however cannot be tormail as tormial has issues receiving email from coinapault or whatever it&#039;s called to receive your bitcoins).&nbsp; When you make the payment you receive your bitcoins pretty much instantaneously if using the email method. Selective scamming is about vendors, not about the method of receiving bitcoin. Bitinstant is 100% legit.

				There is no attack, the repeated logoffs are a glitch and it&#039;s a method installed by the admins to curb attacks. They are working on it. (Per Scout&#039;s post). Make sure you read the first page silk road discussion forums before jumping to conclusions.
