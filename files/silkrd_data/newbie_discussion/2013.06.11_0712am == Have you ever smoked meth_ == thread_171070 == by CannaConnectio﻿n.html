				Nope, never will! I&#039;m undoubtedly not a moral authority, you do what you want. Meth scares the crap outta me. It&#039;s just not worth it. I have an extremely addictive personality so I can only imagine what would happen if I tried it... Me + Meth = death... no doubt. :(

				smoking meth was pretty much un heard of about 20 years ago (when crank was king) then all of a sudden &quot;crystal ice&quot; came along and now it seems smoking is the way most people do it.

				I&#039;ve done most stuff. I guess I realized at one point in life that I didn&#039;t inherit the addiction gene or disfunctions. Therefore...take a chance here and there....lucky me. BUT after studying it and seeing the kids around me &#039;sink&#039;....uggg&nbsp; no thank you! A highly addictive man-made brain frier. I&#039;m thankful it wasn&#039;t in vogue&nbsp; in my younger days. I&#039;ve had three kid neighbors....one&#039;s dead...one now has a personally of a toad (forced recovery)....and the third a beautiful X-model. Mom buys her a new set of boobs, gives her a new car(s)....BAM...all gone. Such a waste to at one time have it all, put men on their knees and then rot away before they&#039;re 25.
