				It&#039;s an incentive to hang around and learn a little before being given the privilege of awarding karma. In the main, new members wouldn&#039;t be aware of what deserves a + or a - karma point in most cases anyway. The majority of new members (not all of them) just want to order drugs without understanding the potential dangers that come with doing so.
