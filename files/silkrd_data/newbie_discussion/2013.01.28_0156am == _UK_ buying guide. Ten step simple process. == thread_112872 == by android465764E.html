				I thought I&#039;d make a simple guide for new UK people. Questions I had when I joined. I&#039;m sharing it so that anyone who is as confused as I was, can get a leg up. It&#039;s so simple you don&#039;t even need a PC if you&#039;re a smart phone junkie. (adequate firewall and protection software is advised however, personally I use AVG Pro Mobile, and Droidwall).&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Get a ฿itcoin wallet from blockchain.info <br /><br />2. Download the Barclays pingit app and register your VISA details. <br /><br />3. Top-up your pingit account using your VISA card.<br /><br />4. Open your blockchain wallet, and click the little Union Jack flag, then select &quot;pingit dsposit&quot;, enter the amount you&#039;re gonna put in, follow instructions and make a note of the mobile number and reference number.<br /><br />5. Open the pingit app, and select &quot;send money&quot;. Choose the amount, and enter the phone number and reference number when prompted. Follow on screen instruction. <br /><br />6. Go into SR and copy your SR wallet number to clipboard (again, long string of letters and numbers).<br /><br />7. Back to blockchain wallet, and select &quot;send money&quot;. Paste your SR wallet number and send.<br /><br />8. Buy drugs and go through the checkout process. <br /><br />9. When prompted, enter your address BUT encrypt it using the seller&#039;s PGP key. <br />SR have extensive help files on setting up PGP on your PC. <br />I also have a guide for using PGP on Android handsets..&nbsp; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116666 <br /><br />10. Wait for drugs to arrive.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Simplified process : <br /><br />VISA &gt; Pingit &gt; Blockchain &gt; SR.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Some things to keep in mind: <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of people out there who will try and catch you out with btc scams.<br />At present, there is no safe way of buying btc with paypal. In the UK at least, so don&#039;t even bother looking.<br /><br />Also concerning bitcoins, you can check the rates at mtgox, or download &quot;Bitcoin Paranoia&quot; app.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barclay&#039;s pingit charge %5.97 for sending out money, transfers between wallets is free, and (from my own experience) VISA do not charge anything extra to send money to Pingit.<br /><br /><br /><br />__________ <br /><br />That&#039;s my contribution to potentially confused UK people. Hope someone finds it useful.

				Yes, thank you very much indeed. You&#039;ve nicely simplified something that was beginning to look a bit daunting.<br /><br />Can I ask why you did not use Bitcoin.de and associate the account there with your online bank account? It seems cheaper than Blockchain and cuts out the middle man so to speak (if I understand it correctly).<br /><br />Right, I&#039;m off to find some top quality UK MDMA crystals (if there is such a thing!).<br /><br />Again, thanks.

				I personally would be very unsure about entering my VISA details in order to get BTC, you are much better off going to BTC OTC and using the IRC channel, they&#039;re links to it over on the security forum. <br />Here is the link to buying bitcoins in the UK, i would recommenced you read all of it and understand what they&#039;re saying.<br /><br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=62808.0<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to buy drugs from an online source there is no point in leading a trail back to yourself, i would take all the safety measures you can that people have already trialed and tested. Research before you buy!

				Is it also as easy to use your bank account instead of PingIt to get bitcoins into your BlockChain wallet?<br /><br />Just set up a PingIt account but I have to go to a branch with ID and all kinds.

				I&#039;ve successfully made my first order, fairly painlessly due in the main to your instructions Android, so thanks for that.<br /><br />I used PingIt, Blockchain.info, iGolder PGP and even set myself up a Tormail account (first time I ever got the username I wanted first go!).<br />Although PingIt and Blockchain makes the money transfer fast and simple I dislike the amount of cut they take from my small pie so will look out for alternatives.<br /><br />The only real confusion I had was around finalising the order. I used a well trusted vendor called Budworx UK. He asks for the order to be finalised before he&#039;ll send it if you have less than 15 orders or are buying coke. Everything I&#039;ve read here says, &quot;don&#039;t finalise before receiving the goods&quot;. So what are you supposed to do? I wanted a dealer and product I could trust and in all my searches on the forum Budworx UK came up trumps.<br /><br />Anyway, I am on tenterhooks waiting for it to turn up, it&#039;s a long time since I was able to get hold of some old time traditional grass. If this works I&#039;ll have a go at some crystal MDMA. It&#039;s got to be better than the stuff that&#039;s been in the SE in recent years.<br /><br />NB: Bleedin&#039; capcha, It gets me every time (and it&#039;s not joke with the Tor network and Silk Road being so slow).<br /><br />Again, thanks.

I&#039;ve bought from Budworx before and FE&#039;d, package turned up nice and stealthy, great communication from Budworx too - he&#039;s a good vendor. You can always find other vendors that are happy to let you stay in escrow, so if you aren&#039;t comfortable finalising early, then don&#039;t as it&#039;s entirely at your risk. <br /><br />@OP: I&#039;d recommend transferring your coins through a couple of temporary wallets for extra security or preferably use a tumbling service (at a cost!) - this will help your coins stay anonymous. It may take a little while longer, but in my opinion it&#039;s worth it.

I used a well trusted vendor called Budworx UK. He asks for the order to be finalised before he&#039;ll send it if you have less than 15 orders or are buying coke. Everything I&#039;ve read here says, &quot;don&#039;t finalise before receiving the goods&quot;. So what are you supposed to do? I wanted a dealer and product I could trust and in all my searches on the forum Budworx UK came up trumps.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Generally you shouldn&#039;t FE as the escrow is for your protection, but sometimes (and especially for newer buyers) you just have to. I&#039;ve bought from Budworx before and FE&#039;d, package turned up nice and stealthy, great communication from Budworx too - he&#039;s a good vendor.

You can FE with him with no drama.<br /><br />Also note, some vendors require FE if you are new and/or don&#039;t have more than three purchases under your belt.<br /><br />SR rules state to never FE. But, in reality it does happen, and people get their stuff.<br />Your call though.
