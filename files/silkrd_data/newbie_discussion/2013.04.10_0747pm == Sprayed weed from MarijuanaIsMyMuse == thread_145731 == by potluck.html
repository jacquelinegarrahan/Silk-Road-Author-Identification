				Bought a some kush from MarijuanaIsMyMuse, After smoking a joint i began to feel very cold!&nbsp; pins and needles from head to toe. never thought much off it till after a sesh. was lying it bed feeling like shit! Getting pains all over my body.&nbsp; as any fellow weed smoker knows getting into a bed after a sesh it like winning the loto! there nothing better! I was left in a state of a weird paranoia... witch i never suffer from! EVER! <br />But anyway. After having my doubts of the product quality i stuck in under the microscope. and to my FUCKING HORROR i came across what look like synthetic cannabinoids mixed in with it.&nbsp; they where deferentially NOT trichomes!!&nbsp; &nbsp;THIS VENDOR IS TAMPERING WITH THE BUD!&nbsp; &nbsp;ether for weight or to make it stronger probably both!&nbsp; It gives you more that a stoned kick!<br /><br />Anybody else bough from him recently?

				I considered ordering from him so thank you for your feedback. I recommend using LexiSadie. Her prices are fair and the product and packaging is the best I have seen in a year and a half on the road. I recently ordered from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NorCalKing which also looks good but i can not speak on this for sure yet. Only reason I went elsewhere was Lexi only ships 2 times per week now but she is very good with her business and a sure thing. I hope this helps. Also you do not have to FE for her but if you do she offers extra weight to your order which is cool. I did this both times and it paid off nicely. Good luck. Research her like i did and you will see she is legit as they come.

				It&#039;s probably not a synthetic but it could be something used to add weight making you feel sick.
