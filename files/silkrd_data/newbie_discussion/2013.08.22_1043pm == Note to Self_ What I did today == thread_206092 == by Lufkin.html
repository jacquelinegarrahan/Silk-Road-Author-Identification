				Changed the front tire on the Scag mower.<br />repaired the pole pruner (Stihl brand) used the pruner to trim the trees over the easement...<br />Watered a few plants, harvested bananas.<br />repaired the pump in the talapia pond.<br />Talked to mike about his meds.<br />Fed the chickens.<br /><br />Now on break during a double shift in the ED. First patient came in asystole and didn&#039;t make it after 20 min of vent attempts and chest compressions. Motorcycle accident! Second patient a drowning. O for 2 so far this morning!<br /><br />No wonder I&#039;m always tired.

				Interesting to see the varied life experiences of members of this forum.&nbsp; I always wonder what the everyday lives of SRers are and if there&#039;s a &quot;typical&quot; person on here.

				I was not supposed to be on call today. If fact I was looking forward to sleeping all day (yeah right). Got a call first thing (forgot to turn the damn thing OFF). Went in for a short shift (just 8 hours). Slow day too, which is nice, got the hours, without the action. Couple homeless guys with too much sun, a tourist with a jellyfish sting, woman having her fourth baby, emergency appy.<br /><br />Piece of cake, piece of crumb cake. Now home and fixing some dinner.

				Slept in till 0730, woke with a bang! Felt great to sleep. Hauled 50 gallons of propane, bought a new water pump, tried to get the MOS on my people carrier but need a new turn indicator. Had southern fried chicken for lunch. Love that stuff. Came home installed the pump, opened a new package from JustsmuggledIn, and here I am! <br /><br />Back to a regular full shift tomorrow. Unless I get lazy again and call out.<br /><br />We need rain here!

				Meant to brag in the last post that I&#039;m not spamming my way to 50. Then I realized that since nobody gives a shyte about my daily posts, it&#039;s the same as spamming my way there. right?

				Big drama on the farm today. Our latest farmer/helper is a 26 year old ex-stripper from Vegas that also happens to be our niece. Helping her get back to something more life affirming job-wise, but the drama is over the top. She&#039;s 26 as I said, but with the emotional maturity of about a 16 year old. We&#039;re getting near the time for a sit down with her to spell out expectations concerning behaviours and duties. <br /><br />On the plus side, it was a sloooow day in the ED. skinned knees, sunburn, heart attack. Spent half the time reading the Pyxis manual for hacking purposes.

				I forgot...<br /><br />--I also worried for a few minutes that I had 3 negative karma points. Then I realized that karma is more like a &quot;LIKE&quot; button. Figured I probably didn&#039;t actually offend anyone.<br />--Then realized how silly it is to care what anybody thinks on a totally anonymous board!<br />--Gave myself a break for being human.

				Wintersky.<br /><br />Love the name! Farming is hard work, but it&#039;s a life saver for me. After work I get in the zone; get all my physical exercise, cardio, core, weight bearing, and do some good for the old earth at the same time.
