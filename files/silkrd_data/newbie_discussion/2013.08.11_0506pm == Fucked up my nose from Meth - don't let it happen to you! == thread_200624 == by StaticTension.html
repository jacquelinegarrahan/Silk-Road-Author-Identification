				Just a little public safety announcement for any meth users here. A little background on me about 3 months ago started doing adderall. Sure enough I started snorting them. Once that ran out moved on to meth because hey it&#039;s cheaper and gets you higher right? <br /><br />My nose was fine before all this but recently went to a ENT doctor and he said I have a deviated symptom. I know ppl will say you can&#039;t get that from snorting shit. I did ask the ENT doctor and he said you def can. Anyways I&#039;m just stuck to taking the pills orally from now cause don&#039;t want my nose to get fucked up more. Just a little warning for any meth users that snort. It&#039;s only a matter of time before it will fuck up your nose. Mind you I was doing it everyday like a fiend but wish I didn&#039;t. In the end it&#039;s just not worth the high to have a part of your body physically damaged. I know all drugs damage your body some way but imo the nose is a vital part that helps you breathe and what not.

				Contrary to popular belief most meth is not that impure. It depends where you source it. With that being said I was into coke for a period long ago, also MDMA mostly orally but on occasion snorted which is the worst pain I&#039;ve ever felt. Doesn&#039;t even compare to snorting Meth, MDMA stings like a bitch. Anyways the meth I was getting was I&#039;d say 60% speed and 40% meth and it was more closer to adderall in chemical structure than pure meth. Still nothing is going up my nose from here on out, it literally is the worst thing you can do. IV is less physically damaging but way more addictive so there&#039;s that to deal with and won&#039;t ever do needles. That&#039;s an arbitrary line I made for myself that I will not cross.

				Well i wouldn&#039;t say cannabis sucks donkey balls or vagina or w/e. When we used to roll all weekend on E there was nothing like smoking weed after or during or just when you start to come down, you start rolling again most of the time. Depends if the pills you have are decent.

				Sorry about that. Thanks for the warning. My advice would be, stop when the nosebleeds start.

				Haha really? Well just an update haven&#039;t snorted anything for a week now and my nasal septum is still not straight but it&#039;s feeling better so I guess quitting while your still ahead applies to my situation. I&#039;ve just been using it orally and it&#039;s almost the same thing. I think snorting is an addiction in itself too. Just the routine of breaking it up and lining it up.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;All only in 3 months you said? That&#039;s rough man, hope it works out well for you. I snort everything, it&#039;s my preferred ROA :) What made you go to the ENT in the first place?

				Ya same here man, I love snorting shit. IDK one night while being sketchy and bored I looked up my nose cause it was plugged and noticed&nbsp; one side was totally blocked. At first I thought it was just swollen but after 10 days I realized that wasn&#039;t the case and I figured that my septum had been misaligned. Went to the ENT doc and sure enough it was. <br /><br />I&#039;m suprised to that it was in 3 months but I used to do coke way back in the day and snort the occasional MDMA pill too so I&#039;m sure it just wasn&#039;t the 3 months but that was as the say the straw that broke the camels back :P
