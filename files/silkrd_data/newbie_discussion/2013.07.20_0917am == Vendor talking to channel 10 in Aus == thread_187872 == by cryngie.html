				Just saw an add on tv for the project saying they have a &quot;cyber drug lord&quot; on the program this week why the fuck would you talk to the media and bring more unwanted attention to this amazing service/site.

				I don&#039;t think the attention is unwanted any more - DPR announced that he had set up a Twitter account in the last couple of days. It has since been shut down by Twitter. On that basis, I am assuming that DPR wants this place to go more mainstream ;)

				Really that saddens me, i saw atlantis were addvertising on youtube which i thought was retarded but i just think bringing it to the public&#039;s attention is bad as LE will be forced to do something if enough people piss and moan about it&nbsp;

				i&#039;d bet the person isn&#039;t a vender, prolly just someone who knows how SR/atl/BMR work and wants to gather a few bucks for talking more or less shit on TV. modern &quot;journalists&quot; especially TV journalists don&#039;t seem to care much about facts as long as the story sounds good.<br /><br />source:&nbsp; a friend of mine was on tv as a hacker.that guy hardly knows how to facebook. so he sat behind a shdow wall and threw around some buzzwords. made him 500 bucks.

				This could do 3 things to our way;<br /><br />1. Get enough attention that the public has an outcry on how bad this is, then forcing governments to put a stop to it all<br />2. Create so much public awareness that the price of bit coins will increase<br />3. Create more competition on SR forcing vendors to drop prices on products<br /><br />Pros and Cons to this situation that are out of control, there are always going to be journalist trying to make a name for themselves. Its what we do to prepare for the next step that leads us in the right direction.
