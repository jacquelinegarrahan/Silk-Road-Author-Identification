				&nbsp;8) First SR post!<br /><br />So, Here is my plan.<br /><br />1. Get Mt. Gox account, verified w/ credentials other than mine.<br />-Curious if anyone has any input on whether that is a good/bad idea.<br /><br />2. Fund Mt. Gox with credit card with same name as credentials.<br />-Again input appreciated.<br /><br />3. Tumble<br />-Blockchain and fogger? Should I use different computers too?<br /><br />4. Ultimately transfer funds to SR.<br /><br />5. PM vendor of choice. Tell them that this will be my first purchase. Confirm order. Never FE until trusted.<br />-Use PGP for sensitive information.<br /><br />6. Know my rights. JK (maybe should have been 1.)<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I will have more questions but how am I looking so far?<br /><br />Thanks. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Dont use mt.gox anymore to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; you cant use credit cards to buy bitcoins either.&nbsp; it went downhill since last year.&nbsp; Use localbitcoin.com or coinbase.com to fund your silk road account.&nbsp; way better alternatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;You dont have to PM a vendor before ordering, once you place the order, just type in your name and address where you want it sent and click place order. there is escrow protection but be aware there are some sellers on here that require new buyers or people with high refund rates to FE.&nbsp; Also many international vendors require a FE as well if you want to buy from them.&nbsp; as for PGP, its up to you to use it or not.&nbsp; other than that, do not rack up a high refund rate (&lt;5%), and never have it go to to &quot;auto-finalize&quot;, other wise almost all venders will make you FE before you can purchase from them.

				I wouldn&#039;t use Mtgox. Use loacalbitcoins. You can get coins by depositing money directly into someone&#039;s bank account, by sending money orders, bank transfers, and you can even meet people face to face to buy coins from them. Remember there is nothing illegal about buying BTC&#039;s. Then tumble them and transfer them to SR and SR has an automatic tumbler built into the site so it does it a second time once you transfer funds to SR. It&#039;s also a good idea to msg vendor and let them know this will be your first purchase and make sure they are ok with you buying from them. Some vendors may require you to FE if it is your first purchase so choose another one that doesn&#039;t do that. Read the forums on the vendor you&#039;re thinking of using and make sure they have nothing but good reviews and you should be fine. And ALWAYS use pgp. It&#039;s your own freedom that&#039;s on the line and it&#039;s your responsibility to learn pgp and protect yourself. Not doing so would be foolish.

Use the Tor-Browser-Bundle, there shouldn&#039;t be a problem with tormail. In my opinion tormail is generaly more safe than a normal email provider.

				Ah ha!&nbsp; I could not get into my new Tormail account until I disabled my firewall!&nbsp; Thank you everyone.&nbsp; Very interesting about the Yahoo email accounts and the different languages....I would have never considered that...<br />There is so much to learn here; I get one thing down and another thing comes up.&nbsp; I dreaded PGP and it actually turned out to be quite fun.
