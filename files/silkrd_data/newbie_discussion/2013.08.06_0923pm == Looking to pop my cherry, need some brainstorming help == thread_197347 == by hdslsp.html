				Hi guys:<br /><br />So this douchenozzle cheated on my little sister, but what he doesn&#039;t know is that I got his SSN and other vital info (even religion). I used it to make a pretty extensive list of notes on him and his family/siblings, for potential security questions and shit.<br /><br />I want to get some revenge on him while making off with some $ at the same time (maybe payoff my Newegg credit line and buy a GTX 780 to replace my two 570s). I don&#039;t want to massively defraud the dude, just cause him some inconvenience in the future and make my life a lot easier than it currently is with student loans and job hunting. It&#039;s as much for my entertainment as it is for revenge, because I find this stuff very intriguing and I&#039;ve lived my adult life in a very morally gray area. Maybe I should be a PI.<br /><br />There is one obstacle I can&#039;t get around and that&#039;s opening a credit line in his name without having the card sent to my address and thus tying it to me. I could open a PO Box with a fake ID, but that&#039;s a lot more involved than I was hoping to get. I feel like having everything from his SSN to his mother&#039;s maiden name (I did my homework) should be enough, but being that I&#039;ve never done this before, I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />I figure that after I get around that, I can buy a ton of BTC and transfer them to my own wallet. I have ideas on where to go from there and how to wash any money that I might want to, as well as trading for gift cards and shit if I decide to just buy things. I saw that there&#039;s a well-reviewed BTC for cash service on SR, might use that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already registered a Google Voice number with a burner, so I have a permanent phone # for registration purposes. I&#039;ve opened a NetSpend account to attempt to verify a PayPal I opened with his info, if it&#039;s even necessary. I would prefer not to go through PayPal though. I know about opening store credit lines in person with clueless cashiers, but that seems potentially messy and there are cameras.<br /><br />I know there are services on SR that might be able to help with this stuff, but I don&#039;t have money to buy BTC with right now. I could sell his info somewhere, but I imagine I would make off with far less money than I can make doing it myself.<br /><br />People here are a lot more experienced with these kinds of things, so if anyone can help, I&#039;d really appreciate it. I wanna have some fun with this dick&#039;s credit rating. If it&#039;s really hopeless then I&#039;ll just sell the info or post it online somewhere to let the 419ers go crazy.<br /><br />If this is a completely inappropriate first post, then I apologize. I&#039;m getting impatient and I&#039;m not really sure where else to turn for this kind of info.

				Can&#039;t really condone this, but if you&#039;re gonna do this then you might as well be safe.<br /><br />You can always send it to a drop address. Monitor some people for awhile, take notes of when they leave for work, when they come back, and what time their mail gets there. When you find an ideal target, ship the credit card or whatever to their house and just snatch it out of their mailbox when it gets there.<br /><br />The farther away from your own house, the better. Of course, make sure that it&#039;s an area where no neighbors are going to notice what&#039;s going on too.

				At that point I may as well go for a fake ID. :P I don&#039;t have a lot of time to case a house.
