				People I warn you. Do not buy large quantities here. I bought a 1kg cocaine and a week later I got 2 packs, in each were books. I opened escrow dispute which lasted two weeks. I showed a lot of evidence that I have been cheated. For example. <br /><br />One package weighed 450g together with the packaging (weighed by USPS). The cocaine alone were to weigh 515 grams. <br /><br />Vendor tried to bribe me into agreeing on FE twice.&nbsp; For the first time he offered an 85% refund. For the second time after purchase he wrote: “do you think you could finalize as soon as the tracking gets updated? i can probably send one of the packs a little heavy for you &quot;<br /><br />In escrow dispute he wrote once so<br />“however, the package that i sent you did not contain a book, but rather a computer hard drive that had been reassembled with 515 grams of cocaine in each one”<br /><br />Later he wrote so:<br />“at no point did i say that each pack contained 515 g of cocaine.”<br /><br />Before I opening escrow dispute he send me message:<br />&quot;both weights were over 1 lb and i have a receipt to document that&quot;<br /><br />and I asked him in dispute:<br />&quot;If you had 10 days to present proofs, why didn’t you do this? After all, it is about USD 32.000&quot;<br /><br />to which he replied<br />“SR rules state that sellers should not save the addresses, so i burned the receipt that was given to me at the store”<br /><br />It was his proof, wasn&#039;t i? 10 days ago he said that he had a sending confirmation to document this. Now suddenly have burnt it?<br /><br />And a whole bunch of other evidence. Why this all I write. Because someone can to learn on my example and do not commit the same mistakes. What is the end of this case. I paid into escrow 1140btc when 1btc cost 27,67$ (31.550usd). I regained back 459btc when 1btc cost 48 usd (22.000usd) and thus lost 9500 usd. Scammer got 459 btc (22,000 usd) for nothing, for that he was trying to cheat me and he lied through his teeth in a dispute and still trade here. Administration took the rest 220 btc.<br />I asked administration why they made such decision and I got answer:<br /><br />&quot;We did decide to trust you and ruled in your favor, you got 70% of the money being held in escrow. Because we couldn&#039;t be 100% sure that what you were saying was true, we had to go with some kind of split. Just be happy that you got the majority of your money back. I know it sucks losing 30% of the money, but just imagine how much worse it would have been if you had gotten a 0% refund! Normally we would choose 0% for someone as new as you, but we put a lot of hard thought into it and decided that our guts told us that there was truth to your story. 70% is the best we can do, please try to be glad that you were able to recover that much on a case where you were the underdog by a long shot.”<br /><br />So people you have to understand that if you are new or you have finite several transactions like me and someone scam you, even if you show hard evidence that you have been deceived&nbsp; you have no chance of winning case.<br /><br />No one has written this in rules and this case should be clearly explained. Hard evidence doesn&#039;t matter, only comments are important. Sorry for my english. I hope that I helped someone.<br />

				I would get a kilo swarmed in at 50 gram a time, that way if I got sent a book my potential loss would be a lot less than taking the risk with a kilo.<br /><br />Any vendor would split up a package and it would be wise to pay extra on post for your own security.<br /><br />If this is true, I wonder who the vendor is.<br /><br />They would have made a few thousand but hopefully the rising value of btc has lessened the pain.<br /><br />I would cry if a gram never turned up!<br /><br />

				Yes please name and shame the vendor in question. Personally I would expect any vendor to keep all info of a transaction until its completed. If you can prove your case(which you did by the packing weight) and the vendor can&#039;t prove his end at all why would there be any reason to split the escrow. I don&#039;t believe its fair for them to look down on you just because you dont have alot of history, you had the weight of the complete package and the vendor had nothing.<br />My opinion is completely based off the info you posting being true. Is there a thread that breaks down how escrow works so they both vendors and buyers can protect there interest?

				So... you don&#039;t mention your purchasing stats.&nbsp; You don&#039;t mention the vendor.&nbsp; If your story is true, yes, it&#039;s obvious he scammed you.&nbsp; But what&#039;s his rating?&nbsp; What&#039;s his history?&nbsp; You&#039;re giving us only this one order to go by, and again, yes, if what you say is absolutely true then it&#039;s pretty obvious he intended to fuck you over from the beginning.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is that basically, if he&#039;s an established vendor and you&#039;re some new guy with 5 purchases of $100 a piece or something... you did get lucky recovering 70%.<br />

				I sold btc in day, in which I got refund. I could not predict that the rate btc will probably increase. Especially that, I already had loss 9.500 usd. I did not want further take risk.<br />On the day which I bought 1kg the vendor had 2 transactions 1kg cocaine already performed and dozens of transactions with Xanax. This is reason why I trust him at the beginning. I had made 7 transactions of 100-300$. I know this puts me at a underdog position. But the guy made many mistakes which I proved in dispute. So what, evidence do not matter?? If you have a few comments everybody can fuck you even if you present hard proof. This is why I give a name this topic escrow security = science fiction<br /><br />vendor stats today: ranked in the top 0% of sellers with 92.9% positive feedback from 121 transactions<br />when I buying he had 86% positive feedback from 60-70 transactions<br /><br />Read part of escrow dispute and evaluate who is scammer in this case. I removed the links to photos and nickname of seller. At the top is the latest part of dispute. My nickname is maxuss<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;maxuss 6 hours March 13, 2013, 1:13 pm UTC delete 100% <br /><br />You&#039;re so funny. Now you are writing that you have burnt the receipt. It was your proof, wasn&#039;t i? 10 days ago you said that you had a sending confirmation to document this:<br /><br />&quot;both weights were over 1 lb and i have a receipt to document that&quot;<br /><br />Now suddenly you have burnt it? Whom are you trying to cheat?<br /><br /><br /><br />You said that both packages contained:<br /><br />“however, the package that i sent you did not contain a book, but rather a computer hard drive that had been reassembled with 515 grams of cocaine in each one”<br /><br />Now you are denying it, because you have no other arguments:<br /><br />“at no point did i say that each pack contained 515 g of cocaine.”<br /><br />An hour before sending you are trying to bribe me by telling me that you will send one package that will probably be heavier, and now in the midst of your lies you are telling me that you have sent both packages with higher weight? Liars usually get lost in what they say.<br /><br />Show me one message proving that you gave me your tormail address or that I gave you mine (I don&#039;t even have it), or where I say that I find it difficult to communicate through SR. As I wrote before you are casting aspersions, proving nothing. Provide to administrator SR access to this tormail and show that such messages are there. Are you going to write now that you have forgotten your password or have deleted these messages?<br /><br />Anyway, your story is absurd. At the end you have only incriminated yourself. I have irrefutable evidence that you have swindled me, and you know it very well, and pressed to the wall, you are trying to tell tall stories.<br /><br />And who is treating whom like a fool?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Mr.X 18 hours March 13, 2013, 1:17 am UTC accept 0%&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; ive responded to all your allegations that i could understand.<br /><br />SR rules state that sellers should not save the addresses, so i burned the receipt that was given to me at the store<br /><br />i dont understand all your nonsense about the dates and i have no reason to investigate further, because i know what i sent, and i know that i always do what is best for the customer.<br /><br />the weights that you have given (which may or may not even be accurate) match up with the amount of the product you received (1kg+)<br />at no point did i say that each pack contained 515 g of cocaine. <br /><br /><br />we then had some communications offline on tormail, because he claims he was having issues with having SR messages show up <br /><br />here is where he introduced the photos (as listed above) of the alleged parcel that he received<br /><br />i then showed him the amazon listing of the book that he claimed to received, the amazon listing showed that the book weighed over 1lb<br /><br />at this point he stopped contacting me on tormail, and instead took it to resolution.<br /><br /><br />for these reasons, i am now 100% sure that you are trying to scam me, so i am not going to waste my time dealing with your silly and hard to understand accusations<br /><br />i would much rather spend my time selling cocaine and doing business with customers that do not treat me like a fool<br /><br /><br />PS to the admins: I have said everything that needs to be said about this issue, so decide how you wish, but i hope it is very obvious to you that the facts are on my side<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />maxuss 20 hours March 12, 2013, 11:24 pm UTC delete 100%&nbsp; <br /><br />Again no answer to the allegations and change the subject. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Mr.X 20 hours March 12, 2013, 11:08 pm UTC accept 0% <br /><br />&nbsp;i will answer a few more accusations but after this i am done with your nonsense. when did i say i was elderly??? i said i was a veteran of the cocaine business.<br /><br />Also please stop with the guilt tripping, it does not make your scam look anymore viable.<br /><br />your statement regarding coming to my country and messing with me <br /><br />this is what really got me upset. people like you should not be a part of the silkroad community, and for this reason only, you should be banned from this community.<br /><br />is this really the kind of site that we want to be a part of? one where buyers threaten just so that they can get a free kilogram of cocaine?<br /><br />i came here because i heard that the users treated it as a community; a safehaven of drug users<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />maxuss 1 day March 12, 2013, 6:48 pm UTC delete 100%&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;To the administrator. I wouldn’t like to give you advice or rush you. I know that what I wrote before may seem unclear because I used an automatic translator. However, I wrote earlier that I had received books instead of cocaine, so I don’t understand why you are asking me what the subject matter of my complaint is.<br /><br />As I informed you in the beginning, my English is rather poor, so please make allowance for it. I often use an automatic translator, so I understand that there could be a lot of mistakes in the text. Now I decided to use a professional Polish-English translator&#039;s services to be understood well. All our private messages and other private issues quoted here were removed out of the text before it was sent to the translator. I inserted them after receiving the translation.<br /><br />The subject matter of my complaint is the fact that I was deceived; I received books instead of cocaine that I had ordered. Both packages were delivered 2 weeks ago. After opening them, I realized that there were books inside. I described the whole situation in my first message a week ago; I added links to pictures, etc.<br /><br />Mr.X, you don’t need to understand what I’m writing because you know very well what happened. And now you’re pretending that you don’t know what’s going on and you’re trying to show that you are an elderly person. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? How can you do something like that to another person? I trusted you. Do you want to improve your life by ruining mine? You used the information that I completed fewer transactions than you and you quote this fact. You’re a louse preying on people’s trust. You’re spreading slander, but you haven’t proved anything. I don’t know how this dispute will end, but regardless of the outcome I promise that I will visit you in the near future. You may talk nonsense that it wasn’t you who sent the packages. I’m 100% sure that you sent them because the shipping was made about 5 hours after the money was paid to escrow. You were convinced that if you gave me the number to track the package, I would release the funds from escrow and that is why you rushed to the post office. I’ve got a German passport, so be sure that I will visit you in the USA one day. Anyway, I don’t have anything more to write to you because you have already shown what kind of man you are. Only insults come to my mind.<br /><br />To the administrator<br />I don’t want to discuss the same thing all the time. But I understand that it is about a large sum of money, so the case must be clear.<br /><br />At the beginning of my conversation with Mr.X I asked:<br /><br />&quot;Hi,<br /><br />I want buy 1kg cocaine. Shipping will be to Poland (UE). I am interested buying 1kg every month. In future, maybe more. But first transaction must be full esrow.<br /><br />greetings&quot;<br /><br />You answered:<br /><br />&quot;Alright Im ready to do that. &quot;<br /><br />So if you agreed on escrow option, why did you suddenly ask me about FE? You say that I insisted on the full escrow. It isn’t true. I only didn’t agree on FE. It may sound similarly, but there is a difference. You tried to persuade me into FE twice.<br /><br />I asked:<br /><br />&quot;You say, you must to research polish customs before deciding on what the refund percent would be. You know already something more?&quot;<br /><br />You answered:<br /><br />&quot;yes i can do it with a 85 percent refund if it doesnt make it if you are willing to finalize early&quot;<br /><br />And I answered:<br /><br />&quot;The first transaction must be full escrow. We talked about this at the beginning. A lot of people here and Blackmarketreloaded wanted scam me. For the last 2 months I have seen really much on this kind sites. &quot;<br /><br /><br />Then, why several hours later did you write to me:<br /><br />&quot;do you think you could finalize as soon as the tracking gets updated?<br /><br />i can probably send one of the packs a little heavy for you &quot;<br /><br /><br />And more less at the same time you changed the description of your profile to “cocaine sold out, waiting for people to release money from escrow”. You are so kind - you will send me one package, probably a heavier one. Asshole, you wanted to play on my feelings, to trick me and con me.<br /><br /><br />Why did you try to bribe me into agreeing on FE twice. For the first time you offered an 85% refund. For the second time you wrote: “do you think you could finalize as soon as the tracking gets updated? i can probably send one of the packs a little heavy for you &quot;<br /><br /><br />You send me message:<br /><br />&quot;no i dont take you for an idiot but my receipt has both weights above 1lb&quot;<br /><br />Then, why do I have one package weighing 1lb together with the packaging (weighed by USPS). The cocaine alone were to weigh 515 grams. What is the weight given in the upper right corner of this picture?<br /><br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />You idiot It is because you put a 200-gram book inside the package. The packaging makes the rest of the weight.<br /><br />The other package weighs 28oz; there is also a book inside, but a bigger one. I attached the pictures of packages to the first message.<br /><br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br /><br />I can send both packages to the people from SR any time. <br /><br />You send me message:<br /><br />&quot;both weights were over 1 lb and i have a receipt to document that&quot;<br /><br />If you had 10 days to present proofs, why didn’t you do this? After all, it is about USD 32.000. Because you are a fucking liar! I’m presenting all the proofs that you deceived me and you aren’t facing the charges, but escaping answers and making up some stories about how long you have been in this industry. I do not care. You are trying to make use of the fact that you have more comments to screw USD 32 thousand out of me. You are a real rogue. Due to people like you, this place is dangerous and I will be reluctant to continue buying here.<br /><br /><br />I checked in the received messages that about an hour or two before sending packages (5:26 pm of your time zone according to what USPS indicates), you wrote to me that you would probably send one heavier package. Now you are writing that you sent both ones of the same weight, which additionally was higher.<br /><br />&quot;but rather a computer hard drive That had been Reassembled with 515 grams of cocaine in each one&quot;<br /><br />You have lied so much that you are getting lost in your own lies.<br /><br /><br /><br />
