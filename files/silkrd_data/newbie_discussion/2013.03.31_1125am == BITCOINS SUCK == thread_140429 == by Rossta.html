These should not matter for a) because if you can figure out how to get on to and use SR you really should be able to work out how to buy BTC and for b) BTC are simply an exchange medium; you are not required to constantly trade solely in BTC, simply to convert some currency into BTC in order to facilitate a transaction, and since prices in SR are pegged to the USD exchange rate the USD cost of a product will remain fixed, so if the cost of BTC goes up/down the cost in BTC goes up/down. What is the issue?<br /><br />You want simple? Go score off some crack-head in the rough part of town and get shit cut with poison. I want quality and I&#039;m willing to put up with a bit of effort to get it - this is a fucking black-market, so grow up.
