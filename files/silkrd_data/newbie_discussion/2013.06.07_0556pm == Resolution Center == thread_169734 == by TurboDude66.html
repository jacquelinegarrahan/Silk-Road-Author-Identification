				Hello, I&#039;ve actually been a member of the Silk Road for a few months now with around 15 transactions&nbsp; but have only browsed the SR forums. I&#039;ve always had flawless transactions on the SR and love the community that its created. Anyways I&#039;ve had trouble locating the Resolution Center because I&#039;ve placed an order with a vendor 11 days ago and since everything has always been flawless on the SR I finalized early as usual. Only this time I never received a package and according to the feedback on the vendors profile it seems I&#039;m not the only one either as others complained about very slow shipping times or not receiving the package. Is there a way to access the Resolution Center to reach an agreement after you&#039;ve finalized early? Like i said I&#039;ve never had to request a refund but the seller has stated they closed their doors and there has been no new communication with the seller.
