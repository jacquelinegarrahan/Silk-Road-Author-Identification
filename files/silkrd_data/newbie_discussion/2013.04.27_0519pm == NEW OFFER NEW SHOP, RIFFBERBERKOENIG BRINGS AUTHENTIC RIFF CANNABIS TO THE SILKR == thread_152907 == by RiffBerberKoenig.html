				Hello,<br /><br />i just opened a new shop and wanted to let you people know, what i have got to offer!<br /><br /><br />GRAND OPENING OF RIFFBERBERKOENIGS NEW ONLINE CANNABIS SHOP!<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hello and welcome everyone!<br /><br />were are proud to present our shop to you and to satisfy your curiosity about our business details.<br /><br />As our debut we would like to offer you a very special herb. It is a sativa strain originated from the Riff mountains, that was discovered on our last business trip :-). We managed to transfer a couple of these really authentic seeds to our cannabis farm over here in Germany, where we cultivated them under the controlled and optimized indoor conditions. (of course &quot;bio&quot;, that means without any chemicals used) That way we were able to harvest this premium class strong Weed, that also fits the needs of medicinal users, who demand a very pure smoke<br />and the ability to fulfill everyday work under its&nbsp; influence. (only try this with controlled doses!!!)<br /><br />As this is our first experience with silk road and this herb, we will only sell in 1g amounts to a special price on a really limited contingent.&nbsp; This way we can check this market, its demand and its acceptance, as well as future possibilities. But if you really really want to, we will not hesitate to ship bigger amounts or multiple times to you.<br /><br />Where do we send from and how fast:<br />We send from Germany.<br />We try to send as fast as possible, this will be no later than the day after the payment is made.<br /><br />Where do we send to:<br />Under normal conditions, we send only to countries inside the EU.<br />Do you live outside the EU and want to order our goods?<br />Feel free to contact us vie PM and we can try to find a solution(depending on your country).<br /><br />How do we send:<br />We try to send as stealth as possible.<br />In order not to unveil our secrets, we`re sorry, that we cann`t go into detailed information here.<br />When you have the wish to order multiple of our items, you can either choose postage paid to recieve one big parcel. Or you pay the postage fee multiple times to get multiple small mails.<br /><br />If you have still unanswered question, please feel free to contact us!<br /><br /><br />CKECK OUT THE OFFER : <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/191ac945fb<br />
