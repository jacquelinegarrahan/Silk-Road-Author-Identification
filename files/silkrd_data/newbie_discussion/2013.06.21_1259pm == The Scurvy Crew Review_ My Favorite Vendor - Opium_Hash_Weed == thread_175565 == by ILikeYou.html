				Alright so here is my review for The Scurvy Crew: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9de2239028<br /><br />First let me get the notion of them being in Spain out the way. Every package Ive ever ordered from them has been 100% Stealth to the BEST. Their lastest package was seriously some of the best stealth Ive seen. I also had on the same day I ordered from TSC Ordered from a vendor in Canada and I received TSC&#039;s packages first. So about a week to the US.<br /><br />The first product I encountered with TSC Was a 1g sample of their Ketama Hash. It is the single best Hash I have tried on the road. Came from Spain in about a week. I was topping all my bowls for about 3 days with this delicious stuff. Since then I have been hooked on TSC.<br /><br />There item that is my favorite out of ALL products on the road is there .75g mix of our Spanish opium and spicy Moroccan hash (70/30 Hash/Opium) It is amazing. Seriously, it has this peppery spicy taste of amazing hash mixed with great opium.<br /><br />So since I love that mix I read they had a new harvest of Bayer opium and opium products. I wanted to get in on this so I ordered an opium tea bag and let me tell you this opened my eyes up to how amazing their quality of shit is. I will be soon sampling their Bayer I hope and will give you a review of this.<br /><br />Review of the Tea I made:<br /><br />From 4:30pm until 6:30pm I steeped the entire pack of ground up opium ACE sent me on low setting on the stove, I read the taste was gross so I popped a grape jolly rancher in at the beginning.<br /><br />6:30pm I strained the concotion with a mesh coffee strainer and then added grape icee syrup into the mixture. I took the first sip and yes it was gross as shit but bearable with the grap. I chugged about 60% and waited a little to see the effects.<br /><br />6:45pm I could hear my stomache grumbling as the mixture was being absorbed into me.<br />7:00pm I started to feel it in my eyes which were getting heavier and I wasn&#039;t overwhelmed so I downed the other 40%.<br />7:15pm By this time the sensation was growing and Feels like I ate a 10mg Percocet.<br />7:30pm More all over body feeling. Very relaxed and even more of a body euphoria. Starting to get itchy.<br />7:45pm Feels like a 30mg perc.<br />8:00pm Started watching a movie and feel asleep probably around 8:30pm.<br />10:00pm I woke back up and still feeling it hardcore, took a benadryl to get the itchiness away.<br />10:00-11:00pm I was nodding just like I had snorted two stamp bags of H.<br />11:00pm Fell Asleep<br />2:50am Woke up to go to the bathroom and still felt it.<br /><br />7:30am The next morning I still feel it all the way through 4pm the next day im still feeling it and still itchy.<br /><br /><br />This is some good serious shit. I know the bag said put 11g in a pot and stew but I dumped that whole sample ACE sent me. I wonder how much it was exactly.

				I want to try opium very badly (never done it before), but I know my friend who has agreed to be my drop address won&#039;t be very happy to receive it. As a result, I look at TSC&#039;s vendor page daily, longingly, weighing my options. I have never taken opiates at all actually, nor do I have any desire to try anything but the extracts of the plant itself. One day it will make it to me.

				Ya you should have no worries on ordering. At first It looks like something you would buy from a health food store. But damn how great of a product it is.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175565.msg1260936#msg1260936">Quote from: fuckingACE on June 21, 2013, 03:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175565.msg1260905#msg1260905">Quote from: NewStem on June 21, 2013, 02:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I want to try opium very badly (never done it before), but I know my friend who has agreed to be my drop address won&#039;t be very happy to receive it.

				Although poppy straw or any other product made from opium poppies can be visually disguised, wouldn&#039;t drug dogs still be able to identify it?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that you will have a vendor in the US and I look forward to ordering the Bayer opium from him when it is available.&nbsp; I confess to being impatient!
