				Thanks balltripper,<br /><br />But now that we can post on the main boards we&#039;re going to (tastefully) promote our small BMR store.<br />The two domestic Australian vendors on SR that are selling dexamphetamine pills are selling them at $10USD per pill! It&#039;s a little greedy considering we know how much they buy them for...<br /><br />We understand that coming on an SR board to talk about a BMR store might make people upset so if giving us good karma will reduce your good karma (don&#039;t really know how the karma system works yet) then don&#039;t risk it.<br /><br />If not then we&#039;ll send some your way also when we hit 100 posts...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Best of luck,<br />AUS-SmartDrugs

Threads containing such info are locked where needed. If something is potentially detrimental need to be quoted to mods or the poster in question must be approached. Who to approach depends on how big an issue it is an whether the poster is a dickhead. Some are just well-intentioned. Like explicit detail of stealth in a review. Others need to be shot 40 times. Like [edit.] who claimed he actually wanted to get caught, and then when he did, unreservedly told them everything let them use his computer. Fuck head. <br /><br />Someone asked this same question about 2 months ago. They said they were doing a report or review or article or some phuking thing. So yeah, it&#039;s come up before. Lol, what do you mean you have a few LE buddies and one ex DEA friend? Hell is wrong with you?! I didn&#039;t know cops were even CAPABLE of having friends, thanks for your correction. <br /><br />Thanks for actually thinking though. It&#039;s so rare around here.

That&#039;s pretty much a mantra to me, always has been, since I started this account. It&#039;s sensible advice. PMs offer a little more protection, not perfect, but better. If you have something explicit to say about packaging or something else like that, then keep it the phuc of main. Bit of common sense goes a long way.

				I agree about having tight lips. (above and below). The majority of LE believe they are doing the world a favor by &quot;taking drugs off the street&quot; and &quot;protecting children&quot;. Which couldn&#039;t be any farther from the truth. It accomplishes nothing. Prohibition does not work. The government know that. Why are they still trying? Who knows... Anyway guys be safe.

				I agree with the OP 100%. No info, no leads, waste of their time. But when members give info and details, they will become more and more interested, and continue to watch even more. STFU and use your brain(not insulting anyone, just being real), common sense goes a long way. Lack of common sense can get you going the wrong way. Be safe, be smart and don&#039;t bring attention to yourselves. <br /><br />Cheers kik. Great post!<br /><br />-PB

				Leaks.... WikiLeaks... SR Leaks...<br /><br />Wanna take down an organization? Military? Society? Spill the secrets....<br /><br />Breach of information in a democracy is a public fight.

				My own theory is that it&#039;s a hell of a lot easier for the Police to ask Customs to keep a closer eye on the contents of packages and divert more resources for the same than set up an elaborate sting, the results of which could well not stand up in a court of law. Actual possession however is usually irrefutable provided they can prove that you knew the contents of a package - of course I am speaking in general terms.<br /><br />Nevertheless you know the kind of precautions you need to take when placing orders such as using the seller&#039;s PGP key to encrypt your address, ideally paying cash to obtain BTC and running them through a coin mixer before purchasing. I wouldn&#039;t want to seem hypocritical for suggesting that you avoid giving out too much identifiable information on the forums but being a member here isn&#039;t a crime in itself - the fact I&#039;m still at liberty in itself shows that. :-)<br /><br />V.

Threads containing such info are locked where needed. If something is potentially detrimental need to be quoted to mods or the poster in question must be approached. Who to approach depends on how big an issue it is an whether the poster is a dickhead. Some are just well-intentioned. Like explicit detail of stealth in a review. Others need to be shot 40 times. Like [edit.] who claimed he actually wanted to get caught, and then when he did, unreservedly told them everything let them use his computer. Fuck head. <br /><br />Someone asked this same question about 2 months ago. They said they were doing a report or review or article or some phuking thing. So yeah, it&#039;s come up before.

				I think that the fact that Newbies read these it is good to point out the obvious. Not everyone has street smarts, remember that. If you don&#039;t tell some people not to stick their hand in the fire they will do it every time. It is those people who need to read all these things and know what to say and not to say on line. I am sure LE not only read these they probably are members as well, so BE CAREFUL.

				Not only did I assume that law enforcement reading the forums, but I assume a lot of TOR nodes are operated by law enforcement. TOR will eventually crack, like any form of encryption is finally, depending entirely on the mechanisms of TOR to protect yourself is a bad idea.
