				Hey everyone. So I basically understand the process, but I saw one link, which I cant find now, which explained in very thorough detail how to encrypt ones address during a transaction. It was talking about using bitinstant as the BTC source but then went on to link another site which offered an encryption service or something. Anyone know the link I was talking about? (I believe it was posted in the newbie section)<br /><br />2 main questions in clarification from above:<br /><br />1) could someone explain how to encrypt an address (or provide that link?)<br /><br /><br />2) what does everyone reccommend as far as where to purchase bitcoins? (is it bitinstant?)<br /><br />Thanks much!

				I use gpg for encryption, others will have other ideas. I think there is a sticky at the top for pgp? <br /><br />I wanted to address your second question; I have always used bitinstant and had good luck with them. I think some transfer to 3rd party wallet and others transfer to SR account,,not sure on the safety maybe others whom are more knowledgeable can chime in! Anyways gl and be safe!!

				Hiya and welcome.<br /><br />I agree and use pgp4win. The forum help in ReD EyE&#039;s link is the place to start. Post your keys there and join the club!<br /><br />For coins...that is a bit harder to answer.<br /><br />Some buy from coin vendors here on SR. Some others go with clearlink vendors.<br /><br />I use a vendor on clearnet and send them here...but to each their own.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Hey guys, thanks for the replies.<br /><br />I checked that thread but it just seems to be 325 pages of PGP keys. I didnt really see a guide in there.<br /><br />Ack, if I could just find that one link I was looking at. It was very detailed, straightforward, and had pictures..<br /><br />I went to the gpg4win page but the instructions seem illusive.. Is there a link to the step by step process o using encryption for a *complete* newb?

				There is one in the Security forum. Learning to use gpg4win is actually very simple, but if you&#039;re too uninterested in doing that, many vendors accept notes encrypted via privnotes.com.
