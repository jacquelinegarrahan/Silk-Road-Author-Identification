				if schools just taught how to manage money, stay out of debt, build shit, and budget wed be ok. once they teach us to read, i say let what they read be their choice. the problems in this world are financial ignorance, media propaganda, and political smoke and mirrors. example, when we said we were fighting the &quot;war on terror&quot; and ended up in iraq, we lost all trust in our leadership. but imagine if we just said, sadams a fuck, no ones doing anything about it and hes hoarding oil so we are going to re establish a democracy there, create a free market for their oil, and hope the positive results spread to the rest of the middle east.&nbsp; i wouldnt be mad? id trust them.

				chem trails is an interesting one.<br /><br />schools definitely take away some of the special aspects of being young, less imagination and horse play and more nap time and rote lesson plans. school system is broken but there&#039;s not much to be done other than complete reform

				I conspire that the media is controlled by the Gov (Which it is pretty much) and they create stories to justify their actions. For example they will create events such as many cops being murdered to fulfill their need to expand their law enforcement teams to have a higher amount of conrol over the people and invade shit.

				Not so much a theory as much of a fact.<br /><br />Economic uncertainty + Lack of trust in financial institutions = Bitcoin WIN.<br /><br />Decentralized currencies is how we take the economic power back from financial institutions. Governments are, by their natures, dependent on their national currencies. Control the currency and you can bring the government down on its knees. We&#039;ve seen it and will continue to see this.<br /><br />Once the US Dollar depreciates to a certain level, other global nations will want to rid themselves of such a risky currency with which they depend on for foreign trade. Once that happens there will be a shift in that the US Dollar will no longer be the world&#039;s predominant global trading currency. It&#039;s already happening and countries like, China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil have begun to realize that the American government is as a whole, terrible at managing their currency, and their own economic trade stability depends too much on such a risky currency.&nbsp; At that time they will also be fed up with the depreciating US Dollar reserves they hold. They&#039;ll start looking at other currency and trade agreements which will circumvent the weakening US Dollar.<br /><br />When that happens, I hope you all have your savings in Bitcoins. The US Dollar will eventually collapse I can guarantee you this friends. As Americans inch closer to their debt ceiling (again) and begin printing more money (again) and nations begin pulling away from the US Dollar (again), things will begin to destabilize. Why do you think gold and silver are in such demand and trading so high? People begin to lose faith in a currency they start looking to precious metals (which have historically weathered many economic storms since they will always hold value) and other forms such as Bitcoins.<br /><br />When, not IF, the US Dollar collapses, I will be taking an extended vacation outside of the US and trading my Bitcoins into whatever country&#039;s currency I choose to live in. Heck, there&#039;s an exchange every currency nowadays. <br /><br />Now if you want to get really crazy you start linking how American freedoms are slowly being eroded through so many other guises, such as gun control. When a population gets fed up with the financial irresponsibility of its own government you see Occupy Wallstreet. When a population becomes angry because they have no money due to the irresponsibility of its own government.. Do you really want them equipped with assault rifles? <br /><br />I&#039;m just waiting to see when the first loan default will occur and social security check unpaid. When furloughs become mandatory and electricity is rationed as it happened to Great Britain shortly after the British Sterling Pound was replaced as the world&#039;s trade currency. That will be the day folks! If you&#039;re holding onto your Bitcoins, you will probably be better off than those scrambling to sell their stock and investment holdings and those making a run at the banks. We shall see... :)<br /><br />-CC

				&quot;Chem trails&quot; are caused by the rapid depression of gas from a jet engine, when a gas expands it becomes cold. the result of burning any kind of organic fuel (methane, propane, ethanol ect) is CO2 and H2O, the water from the combustion process freezes and thus you have a trail. The only question i ask myself is why do they seem to last so long and not just simply blow away? perhaps the lower density air up there has fewer gusts?<br />I recently had this on a college exam so I would say my professor with a Phd would know a thing or two ;)<br /><br />Dr K

				Within a community of drug users, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have to search hard to find believers in government conspiracy.&nbsp; After all, if we all loved the government we&#039;d probably listen when they told us not to take drugs.<br /><br />I heard from a reliable friend (still not a great source I know, but I&#039;m sure it could be verified) that a recent poll found that more than 50% of the US population believed in legalization.&nbsp; So to me, it seems a no brainer for the pollies to jump on board... yet they don&#039;t.&nbsp; None of them do.&nbsp; Makes me wonder if perhaps the organized crime is pulling strings to keep drugs illegal and keep the money flowing in.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I really love about SR; there&#039;s no territory disputes or shoot-ups or robberies.&nbsp; There&#039;s no violence or ignorance.&nbsp; There&#039;s no stupid fucks having gang battles over who to sell to.&nbsp; Here the seller with the best product, best service and best stealth wins.&nbsp; Disputes over territory are done with feedback and forum posts.<br /><br />I also like to think I&#039;m doing my part to bring down prohibition.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t beat us, perhaps they&#039;ll be forced to join us...

This is my first post. Been lurking for a while, finally decided to jump in :) <br />I totally agree with you. <br />Schools and religion are brainwashing agencies that steer you away from the truth and condition you to follow the pack and not question what you&#039;re told. They want the masses ignorant, not educated. <br />I&#039;ve learned more on the internet than I ever learned in schools. <br /><br />Check out Naomi Wolf - End of America docu. Very interesting.&nbsp; <br />Food Inc also eye opening. <br />Or anything Ron Paul has been saying for the last 30 years.&nbsp; <br />I have more I just can&#039;t think of them right now.

				If the government had been honest about drugs, I might never have learned to mistrust them.<br /><br />They taught me that weed was bad, but when I tried it, I learned it wasn&#039;t.<br />Then I tried all the other drugs that are &quot;bad&quot; and found that most of them weren&#039;t.<br /><br />While listening to them telling me how bad drugs were, I watched them raking in huge taxes from alcohol and nicotine.... all while the legal drugs killed tens of thousands every year.&nbsp; So I started looking into other stuff the government proclaims, and found most of it to be a big steaming pile of bullshit.<br /><br />If you lie to intelligent people enough, they&#039;re gonna learn to ignore you after a while. Maybe the disenfranchised will wander off and build their own worlds. Kinda like SR and Bitcoin :)

What I find so amusing about infowars in particular is that it is *exactly* the kind of thing that all of its community accuses the mainstream media of doing. It exists solely to whip people into paranoid frenzies to sell them precious metals, overpriced ammunition and other affiliated products and linkbait. <br /><br />He uses FUD to get rich. He&#039;s a massive troll. Kind of like Limbaugh, he&#039;s an industry unto himself profiting on the ignorance and xenophobia of his audience. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying the government is good, at all. I am saying that if you think that Obummer is going to use FEMA to open concentration camps and confiscate your weapons, you are definitely an idiot, and a very good customer for a guy like AJ. <br /><br />P.S. anyone who thinks chemtrails are a thing is a moron, and about 1 step away from this useless meatbag: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV9gRFv5Kgc
