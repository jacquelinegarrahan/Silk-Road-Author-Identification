				I&#039;ve noticed that it takes a long time to get btc from my wallet to the sr wallet. I think that is because sr waits for a certain number of confirmations. Are you saying your btc got to the sr account and then disappeared? I wonder if you should change your pin?

				I&#039;m pretty new at this BTC stuff so I dont know, what actually have happened. But I can see more experienced users have same problems.<br /><br />on this site https://blockchain.info/ you can see when your money enters and leaves your wallet. That is how I understand it however.<br />And mine entered 13:26 and left 14:15.....???

				Things have been a little &quot;phishy&quot; in my opinion as I keep getting kicked back to login page.&nbsp; Some of the verification codes don&#039;t seem legit.&nbsp; Sometimes they come up as 3 numbers rather than the usual 4-5 letter characters followed by 3 numbers.&nbsp; i always refresh until I get a legit verification code.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but wonder if someone has somehow managed to phish for passwords.&nbsp; I was corresponding with a customer last night who told me he watched his account balance go from 1700.00 to 280.00&nbsp; Weird that if someone had access to his account they didn&#039;t just take it all...then again, what else could it be.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel comfortable storing large amounts of btc in here anymore.&nbsp; Not sure what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; Maybe it will magically reappear the same way it disappeared.

				The 3 digit captcha is fine, it&#039;s been pointed out that it has sometimes been like that for the last few years, they are talking about it in another thread somewhere.&nbsp; And everyone keeps getting kicked back to login page, but it seems if you just use 1 or 2 tabs only you dont get kicked. So close everything but SR down and just use 2 tabs and you should be right.

				i have also noticed this with the weird chaptas, and have also refreshed until i got a &quot;normal&quot; one.. i really hope this money is coming back, since I pretty much threw all my money in to that account :\<br /><br />I just want to know if someone is looking in to this, and if there is some hope left, getting my money back :)

				Hi folks,<br /><br />The deposit process can take up to 24 hours but normally takes a lot less.<br />If you&#039;re checking the deposit on a site such as blockchain.info then what you&#039;re seeing is Silk Road&#039;s tumbler in action. There is nothing to worry about, and you will receive your coins.<br /><br />If you do not receive your Bitcoin within 24 hours of having sent them, you can contact SR Support on the main site using the link in the bottom right hand corner of any page.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156528.msg1096562#msg1096562">Quote from: JumboMonkeyBiscuit on May 06, 2013, 05:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Things have been a little &quot;phishy&quot; in my opinion as I keep getting kicked back to login page.&nbsp; Some of the verification codes don&#039;t seem legit.&nbsp; Sometimes they come up as 3 numbers rather than the usual 4-5 letter characters followed by 3 numbers.&nbsp; i always refresh until I get a legit verification code.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but wonder if someone has somehow managed to phish for passwords.&nbsp; I was corresponding with a customer last night who told me he watched his account balance go from 1700.00 to 280.00&nbsp; Weird that if someone had access to his account they didn&#039;t just take it all...then again, what else could it be.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel comfortable storing large amounts of btc in here anymore.&nbsp; Not sure what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; Maybe it will magically reappear the same way it disappeared. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please see scout&#039;s post on the above issue here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156229.msg1093971#msg1093971<br /><br />Locking this as resolved.<br /><br />Libertas<br /><br />EDIT: I have modified the thread title as it is misleading and somewhat alarmist, and may cause others to panic.
