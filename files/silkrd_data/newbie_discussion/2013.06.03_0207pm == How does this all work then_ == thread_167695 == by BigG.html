				Thanks Libertas,<br /><br />Think i have a lot of reading to do as well as making myself a little more secure before i can become a vendor actually found the forum before the website blows my mind a little tbh that this is available still getting my head round the whole deep net/tor thing.<br /><br />will have a read through the documents also things to look into<br /><br />making my tor use secure<br />vendor information you have provided<br />bitcoins<br />packaging products for post<br />postage of products<br /><br />anything else i should be looking into?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Make not only your Tor secure but all you communications , an excellent setup is a sim phone bought with cash or non traceable payment, then get a VPN and you are set.<br />You must also learn how to transfer your BTC to cash to fund your operation.

				cheers and tbh your right im not close to ready yet,<br /><br />I found the forum before the silk road website maybe my question was premature i didn&#039;t realize how much was involved i appreciate the help provided already by forum members the website helped me understand better the process which is what the original question was referring to. i thought it was all done through forum which i would have dismissed straight away but after reading up on the sellers guided my interest is renewed although i have realized i need to gather lots information as well as trying a few purchases and building up some reputation amongst the forum.<br /><br />my apologizes if my post was unthoughtful still getting my head round the whole concept of everything.<br /><br />many thanks BigG<br /><br />and hopefully ill see you all as a trader in the coming months.<br /><br /><br /><br />
