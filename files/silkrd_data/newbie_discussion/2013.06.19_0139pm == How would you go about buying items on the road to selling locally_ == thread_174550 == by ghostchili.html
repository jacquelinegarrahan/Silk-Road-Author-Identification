				How do you build up a customer base in the first place?&nbsp; For example, molly would be the most profitable from where I live right now.&nbsp; Problem is, I don&#039;t have any friends that use it...<br /><br />Well I do know this one chick, but I don&#039;t want to lead her on and make her think I&#039;m into her (that was just a one time thing)....&nbsp; So I don&#039;t know how well she could move it for me.<br /><br />I know they&#039;re big at raves and dubstep clubs where I&#039;m from.&nbsp; I just never really frequent that scene.<br /><br />How would you suggest getting started and getting customers?

				If you are asking questions like this then you are not ready to sell IRL. You need to do your research or else you will be caught in a month. That being said; If you have it, they will come.

				You need to find the highest in demand at the moment then since it will have better quality than the local dealers because it&#039;s off of SR you can undercut them and sell for a lower price or sell at the same price and a customer base will find you, once word gets about.

				To sell on &#039;the streets&#039; you do need to know a few people, that take the drug you sell, to get you started!<br /><br />If you have quality stuff you can then start with the people you know who will likely do the drugs with people they know who will then ask where they got it from and will eventually also end up buying it from you!<br /><br />Then they cycle continues like that!<br /><br />IMO you really do need to start selling to people you know first because then you can build up a chain of customers that are all linked together by people you can trust! Never sell to anyone that cant explain how they managed to get in contact with you. never sell to people who randomly approach you. Confirm everybody&#039;s story of how they heard about you before selling to them! If you follow this then you can keep relatively safe.<br /><br />Molly is ok for the profit margins but requires a larger customer base than other drugs because it isn&#039;t moreish meaning that repeat custom is not likely (Some people will be able to make a gram last a weekend). Drugs like coke are the opposite... if someone takes one you can almost guarantee they will be back as soon as its gone!<br /><br />Remember tho that its a risky game to play and its your freedom on the line! Better to be to paranoid over not being paranoid enough!
