				New vendor for hash in Canada...<br /><br />A very well deserved 5/5!<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Communication 5/5: Quick responses and helped setup a custom order for me.&nbsp; Answered within a few hours usually. <br /><br />Price 5/5:&nbsp; You cannot beat this price on domestic hash right now.&nbsp; Even compared to international the price/performance of this hash is excellent.<br /><br />Shipping/Stealth 5/5: 3 days express shipping and the stealth is top notch!&nbsp; Heat-sealed mylar for a domestic shipment makes me sleep easy at night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Product 5/5: As a long time connoisseur of some fabulous hash I&#039;m always on the lookout.&nbsp; This is the best domestic hash I&#039;ve smoked.&nbsp; The consistency is gummy and pliable, just the way I like it.&nbsp; When you break a piece off it looks exactly like the picture, dark on the outside lighter on the inside and a great smell.&nbsp; It&#039;s extremely potent with a heavy indica stone to it.&nbsp; There&#039;s no reason to order international anymore.&nbsp; Also the order was overweight, like a boss!<br /><br />Try this vendor if you&#039;re looking for some good quality hash from Canada!

				I&#039;m not trying to detract from such a stellar review of someone, but i find it hard to assume credibility from someone who has just 1 post(this one) and is named reviewuser. I would be simple for someone to claim that they have a lb of weed for sale with one account, make a new one and claim that you made a purchase and give a good review, then rip other people off with their newly formed sense of security. <br /><br />just my 3 cents
