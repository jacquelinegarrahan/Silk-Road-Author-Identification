				I was looking to buy some 2CB and haven&#039;t seen much discussion in other threads about the best vendors. I was looking at Subtickle, Ivory and mahakala. Anyone had any experience of their 2CB, or if not just any of their products in general?

				Would you suggest 2-cab for someone who has done acid a few times and shrooms and handful of times and enjoyed it, but had a horrible experience on salvia?

				Salvia is probably the least euphoric psychedelic I have ever done, except bufotenin *shudder*. I never had a terrible experience with salvia, but I never really had a great one either. Actually now that I think about it I even recall one trip I had on it where I felt like the texture of the objects I was looking at was being rubbed on my eyes lol. Anyway, 2-CB is a great psychedelic. It doesn&#039;t really last all that long either. I like to describe the visuals and the trip as being very &quot;digital&quot;. It&#039;s pretty fun I would definitely recommend it if you enjoyed acid and mushrooms.

I like the fact that it doesn&#039;t last long. That way if anything goes awry it will be done soon. The way you describe the trip seems enticing. How long does it take to kick in? And what about doing.meth before/during/after. :-p
