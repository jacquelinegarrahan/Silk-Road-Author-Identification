				Alcohol and valium. I woke up on the floor like 1 foot inside the door of my apartment. It was -30 outside, so if I&#039;d passed out 10 seconds earlier I would have frozen to death. I used to party til blacking out on a regular basis, good times for sure.

				we had a friend we called &quot;hops&quot; because he had turrets so bad he would hop off the ground from time to time.&nbsp; i dont know what the medication he was on was called but it was a strong tranquilizer type med.&nbsp; he had two; small yellow or orange glossy triangles and small green glossy squares.&nbsp; we had all tried them from time to time with no results.&nbsp; well one night i was selling the usual xanax, klonopin and valium and he wanted some bad.&nbsp; he didnt have cash but he had the crazy little pills.&nbsp; so i traded him a couple roche for a hand full of these tranqs.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was sent into a dream world for three days, had no idea what was going on around me.&nbsp; I would walk down the road and walk into random houses and start yelling and screaming gibberish.&nbsp; My friends ended up having to take me out to some other friends of ours house and tell their mom i was mentally challenged and my parents had left town.&nbsp; they got her to take care of me for a couple days and i slowly came back to the real world.&nbsp; <br /><br />I lost 4-6 solid days during that episode, including all my money, drugs, jewelry and anything else people could steal off me.<br /><br />worst &quot;drug&quot; time of my life.

				Believe it or not, I blacked out for maybe 5-10seconds from one hit of Humboldt, way back in the mid 90&#039;s. lol.. This stuff was stellar, but I believe it was nothing more that intense head rush from the hit. I was sitting down while inhaling, and went to stand up and almost fell down. It kinda scared me casue I never had any rush like that before.<br />

				i took lots of almost everything but only had blackouts on wodka (sometimes wodka + weed). Probably close to a hundred and one time i woke up in the hospital with all kinds of testers on my body. Pretty scary! I didnt drink alcohol for years now tho. Hate it. i can never stop when i start. Then getting aggressive, fuck up my whole room/pc just to wake up in that mess and dont know what the fuck happened. FUCK alcohol<br /><br />And honestly i will never understand how alcohol can be legal while cannabis/lsd/xtc or what ever is not. There is just no sense at all. Alcohol is the worst of em all! Makes aggressive, u dont know what u r doing at all and what not. The only answer for that is because more than 50% of politicans are fuckin alcoholics!

				A firecracker believe it or not.&nbsp; I made and ate them the night before, and I woke up at 6AM and walked maybe 20 feet, looked in the mirror, realized I was still high as FUCK (tolerance was still low), I started walking back to bed and woke up on the floor not realizing what happened haha.

				I&#039;ve only blacked out on alcohol.&nbsp; The first/worst time was at a party where there was a big punch bowl of sangria.&nbsp; A lot of people got really messed up on that and some speculated it had been spiked with GHB, but I think probably it was just way more alcoholic than people realized since it was so sweet and fruity.

				Liquor and xanax.&nbsp; The next was ether and nitrous, not the same kind of blackout as liquor but I blacked out and had seizures.&nbsp; Then beer and klonopin.&nbsp; The rest all involved xanax.

				I was about 17 or 18 with some friends relaxing before going out to a party or something.&nbsp; We smoked a little and I was drinking some 10 year old Rye that I used to like.<br /><br />The next thing I know I&#039;m driving my car down the street a good 3 miles from where we were, off to the party.&nbsp; I blacked out again some months later, while drinking the same 10 year old Rye brand.&nbsp; <br /><br />Needless to say I stopped drinking Rye and started drinking Vodka and Rum, haven&#039;t had a blackout since, although I no longer drink that much anymore, the occasional beer on a hot day or a drink when going out to dinner are about it now.&nbsp; When the hangovers started lasting longer than time spent drinking and partying the night before, I decided it wasn&#039;t worth it anymore, I stick to chemicals these days.<br /><br />

				In my amateur and overzealous days I slammed 18+ fucking grams of dried cubensis to the dome. I ground them up finely and drank it all in a few gulps of orange juice. <br /><br />NEVER DO THIS<br /><br />I went into a dream like sleep walking autopilot state. I was by myself and accidentally left my residence for a while during this state.. I got into some trouble to say the least and am very lucky I didn&#039;t get arrested and was able to make it back inside before totally blacking out in a heap.&nbsp; All said, I woke up in total amnesia/shock for a while, running around frantically having no idea what I, or anything around me was before remembering I was a human being and was &quot;alive&quot; and was on this planet called earth, and that there was planets, other people, I did too many shrooms, etc. <br /><br />The thing that first started to ground me was the realization that I could read words and numbers. I looked around me and realized my brain knew how to process these symbols, and then I began to be able to recall the ideas these symbols represented, but I still had to fight and claw hard for a good while to fully re-integrate.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Dumbest fucking thing I ever did in hindsight, but taught me a great lesson which I now live by. Never underestimate the power of psilocybin!

				Alcohol. Vodka and some kind of brandy I think.<br />Quite a few years back I raided the stash my mom hides from my dad. <br />I don&#039;t know if it was from the combination or what but I went from a bit drunk to waking up in my bed the next morning, my ribs and back really sore and no idea why. My parents wouldn&#039;t talk to me or tell me what happened for 3 days. Finally my brother filled me in....<br />APPARENTLY I wrestled with and swore at my father until my folks called my brother to come calm me down. My dad kept me pinned to the floor until he showed up.<br />APPARENTLY I talked to him for about an hour, alternating between accused my mother of stealing my weed (which I found the next day right where I usually put it... :-[ ), crying and apologizing and being belligerent<br />Finally he told me to go to bed, I said ok, got up and went straight to bed.<br /><br />To this day, I can&#039;t remember Any of it. Didn&#039;t even know my brother had been at the house.....it&#039;s a terrible terrible feeling.<br />I hate it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t drink at all anymore.

				Alcohol, only ever blacked out on that, Ketamine and MXE a few times. I am anxious and a bit of a control freak so not being able to remember what I did the previous evening is incredibly uncomfortable for me and I do my best to avoid it.

				Tequila, lots of tequila. One minute I&#039;m doing shots in a bar in Shoreditch, the next thing I know it&#039;s dawn and I&#039;m waking up outside some storage lockers somewhere in Hackney. My face was covered in scratches and I&#039;d lost my phone and wallet. When I finally got home my girlfriend, who had been freaking out, told me she&#039;d turned around for one second and when she looked back I was gone.
