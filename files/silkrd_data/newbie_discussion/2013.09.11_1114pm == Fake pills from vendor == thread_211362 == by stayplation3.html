				I ordered 10 30MG roxy oxycodone from this seller with 1 day shipping and 3 days later i got my order but the pills are FAKE. I got 8 A215&#039;s and 2 K9&#039;s. I know they are fake because the last time i took oxy was 2 weeks ago and it took me about 20MG to get totally high as a kite, like too high. Now 2 weeks later I just snorted 60MG of the A215 and 30MG of the K9 within a period of 45 minutes, after I snorted the 60MG of a215 i waiting 20 minutes then did the 30mg of the K9, i can barely feel the k9, the 2 k9&#039;s i got i think are real but they have got to be at least 10 years old because i did 30mg and it feels like i only snorted 5mg. they are VERY weak. and no it isnt my tolerance. And on top of that, the a215 pills have no taste whatsoever, like water. and they also have no smell at all. I also noticed that some pills are slightly different sizes. Also they are all white. From what I know they should be a tint of blue. the 2 k9&#039;s i got are white but they taste bitter and smell chemically. Now I dont want to call this guy a scammer yet because it could have just been a problem with his source or a mistake since the k9&#039;s are super weak but they are real, maybe his source gave him a batch of fake a215. As of now i am not dissing this seller cuz it could be a mistake from his source. I messaged the seller and asked what he was going to do about this, waiting for a reply. i also stress that I am not dissing him or calling him a scammer YET. dont be scared to buy from him until I let you guys know if he is going to fix this.&nbsp; http://oi41.tinypic.com/168byfk.jpg they look kinda real but they are white, and the top most pill and the one to the right of it is slightly smaller than the rest, they also dont have that grainy looking texture like they should they are totally smooth looking. and sorry for a long post.&nbsp; I need to know what to do from here to get my bitcoins back if he refuses to send real pills. I dont want to say the vendors username in case he fixes this. If he doesnt then ill let you guys know.<br /><br /><br />Update: seller messaged me 1 hour later and said other people are saying the same thing. He said he will message me soon when he has the ability to replace the pills. :) so there is hope :D ill update when i got more to say

				UPDATE! I&#039;ve been scammed! WARNING!**VENDOR SELLING FAKE PILLS TO SCAM**!WARNING Vendor: NOLUV22 is selling real AND fake pills! If you bought pills from NOLUV22 make sure you test ALL of them before you finalize. He sent me 5 fake 5 real pills and after a long time in escrow it finally went to the resolution team... and he lied to them, LOL!!! I took pictures and had proof of him admitting to having supplier problems, then he goes on to tell the support team the pills werent fake and that I was being difficult and that I was the bad guy ROFL. I showed my proof to the resolution team and got a 70% refund for the 5 fake pills.&nbsp; So he is guarenteed a scammer. He also scammed another user who he made FE, then sent fake pills to that user. He NOLUV22 comes to the forum to try to lie ill post all the messages between us proving he is a scammer.

				OUCH! sorry to hear about your losses man :( Yeah definitely do some research on the forums before you trust vendors you can&#039;t just trust their SR page alone. This really worries me that people like this are in the SR family. SOOO dangerous, what if someone wouldve shot up the fake pills? No bueno in my book.

				I got burned with fake Roxies IRL once. You always think you&#039;re safe with pills too, so much harder to counterfeit. Watch out on the street and on SR for those. If you look closely at them you&#039;ll see they&#039;re oddly pale and when you crush em up they crumble in a way that makes it obvious they&#039;re fake. Fuck anyone who knowingly sells bunk shit, they&#039;ll get what&#039;s coming to em, that&#039;s for sure.
