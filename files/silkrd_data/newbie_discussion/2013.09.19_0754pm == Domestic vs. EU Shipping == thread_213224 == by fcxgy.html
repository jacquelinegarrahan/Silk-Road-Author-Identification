				Hey, i&#039;m just wondering whats better?<br />If you live in the EU, should you order from your country or some other EU country?<br /><br />i was thinking what happens if a vendor gets busted - he might have the adresses of his customers. So if he&#039;s in the same country as the buyer, LE has an easyer way of coming after the buyer as opposed to a cross-europe delivery.<br /><br />On the other hand, if a package stays in the same country, the way it has to go is much shorter, and therefore the danger of being found/lost seems less.<br /><br />any advice for a noob?

				I think this adds just the risk of your package going through customs control. There are several agreements between LEs in different EU countries. I remember a case were LE from Belgium gave out adresses to German LE after they busted the guy who brought the packages to the postal office for the DutchGreenClub. <br /><br />That a vendor could store adresses is the one thing that worries me the most too. Unfortunately it is something where you have to rely on the vendor.

				No customs doesn`t mean there are no controls. Like you still get controls in a certain area around the borders. As far as I know do they have a few postal sorting centres where every mail from foreign countries is sorted. There are still some mail controls happening. The more likely if this country is known for drugs like e.g. NL, CZ. <br />This is what I read about Germany don`t know how other EU countries handle this.

				I prefer ordering from domestic vendors. I prefer this because orders are less likely to get lost and most of the time it doesn&#039;t even take two days before I have my order in my hands.

				Yes, I feel a little more secure knowing that everything is being kept within the Royal Mail system, and of the orders I&#039;ve made the ones I&#039;m still waiting on are from overseas.
