				I wish I had the balls to give vendors the rating I feel they deserve. My first order on SR went like this....<br /><br />After lurking for a while and picking my first vendor( let&#039;s call him GE) and scoring some BC , I finally pulled the trigger and ordered some gear. <br />5days in processing<br />&nbsp;15 days in transit.<br />3 days before responding to my PM&#039;s<br />When product arrived I was disappointed in both quantity and quality.<br />Still, due to my noobness and GE&#039;s long record as a vendor, I gave him 5/5. Prolly deserved a 2/5. <br /><br />Was I stupid doing this? Had issues with another vendor(stealth) but still gave 5/5.<br />I feel like I failed the system.

				Hi,<br /><br />When our journey started on this road (around a year ago...), we sent out samples and asked for feedback - not only of product, but also of packaging/delivery methods.<br /><br />The only way SR will continue to be able to operate is if buyers and vendors alike take their security seriously. <br /><br />Let them know something is/was off in the delivery - at least give them chance to put it right.<br /><br />HTH.<br /><br />

				As far as the stealth issue goes, there was no need to point out the problem, it was obvious. You don&#039;t knot tie a corner baggie with 3.5gr. product and throw it in an envelope and call it stealth. Now...it came way overweight and was some of the best stuff I&#039;ve had, but still.

				That sounds 100% unacceptable to me.&nbsp; That&#039;s a security risk and there&#039;s nothing stealth about it.&nbsp; Why would you feel a need to give a 5/5 just because everyone else knowing that what you received isn&#039;t stealth in the least bit?&nbsp; And personally I don&#039;t see how the vendor could make it right at that point.&nbsp; They could give you some bitcoin back to make you feel better, but they screwed up.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t ever planning on using that vendor again what&#039;s stopping you from giving them a 2/5 and mentioning what went wrong so other buyers can make an informed decision based on your experience?&nbsp; I know as a buyer that I would want to know to expect that if I purchase something from that particular vendor that there&#039;s a chance he could throw it in a fold over bag and just toss it in the mail.&nbsp; But if nobody steps up to the plate and write that in a review then I as the next buyer won&#039;t know any better and be as upset as you when my package arrives sloppy.&nbsp;

				I did the same thing with my first three purchases...All different vendors, and I reviewed them sooner than I should have- I should have tried the more of the gear over a longer time.&nbsp; With wanting to pay the vendors and acknowledge receipt, I barely tried each.<br /><br />I&#039;m facing another shipment of product I don&#039;t believe has much if any real shit in it.&nbsp; A regent test does not indicate purity and will test positive with even trace amounts.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not looking to trash someone&#039;s business.&nbsp; However, selling fake dope and getting away with it is not acceptable to me or I imagine, anyone.

				yah i have been bitching about the numerical ratings for a while<br />it seems 5/5 is the only positive choice and the rest are all considered negative. a 4/5 is hardly negative. i think 3/5 and 4/5 should probably be the most common if the system was used properly. <br />start rating the way you honestly feel. remember that vendors make a living doing this a lot of the time and the ratings can greatly effect their business. it should be taken seriously. but if we all rate vendors honestly it will give ourselves and others a real insight into the vendors we are buying from and in the long run we will have a better and more successful road because of it&nbsp; <br />accountability equals a better experience for everyone.<br />dont rate out of fear or intimidation. i dont like it when i see vendors saying they will not deal with you again if you dont leave 5/5&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				Completely agree, I have seen some say something like &#039;quality was really poor and the stealth was dismal&#039; and yet, still gave a 5/5????? Stealth should always be 5/5, anything else is unacceptable! I do think that if you have a problem with delivery time, quality, etc. you should give the vendor the benefit of the doubt, message them and see if you can come to an agreement. If they don&#039;t bother to answer their messages with concerns.....then they deserve what they get! Giving an automatic 5/5 is really a diservice to everyone!

				I tend to buy small amounts from new vendors to test the water and if they advertise High Grade AAAA etc and it clearly is not then I will mark them 4/5 or 3/5 depending how bad.&nbsp; Then not go back. <br /><br />After a few months if they are established sellers I make a point of going back and changing the feedback to 5/5 as why should that early 2g order or so harm their stats. <br /><br />For established vendors I have had a few hiccups but always sorted out as i believe both parties are honest. And when you&#039;re honest things tend to go right. <br />

				@OAK..<br /><br />exactly.....a 4/5 is a good score and shouldn&#039;t be considered a negative.<br />5/5 should only be given when everything is perfect...<br /><br />Processing time<br />Delivery time<br />STEALTH!<br />quality<br />&nbsp;Quantity<br /><br />Very hard to get it all right all the time.Impossible even.So a good percentage of reviews should be 4/5&#039;s.....a GOOD score.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong...I don&#039;t want to ever give bad reviews but I think the five point system isn&#039;t helping the buyer anywhere near as much as it does the vendor.<br /><br />Maybe a 10pt system? I don&#039;t know. I sure its been discussed. I&#039;m just saying.

				also buyers have to take responsibility as well when choosing who to buy from. vendors have to insist on 5/5 ratings because us buyers can have extremely high and unrealistic expectations. no one will buy off anyone with a feedback score of less tbe 95% lol thats very high. i would like to see any legit business pull that off. if everyone started using the system properly, your overall percentages are gonna drop and i think we would see a much larger range of overall scores.

				Raise the rating system to 10 or even 100... that would really show the quality in vendors. However, we probably do not have enough vendors where it would be feasible to use a scale of 100, but still... it would really help.
