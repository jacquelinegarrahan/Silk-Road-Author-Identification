				I haven&#039;t had MDMA in a long time, so I wouldn&#039;t mind testing them out and writing you a detailed review. I have written a lot of erowid experiences so I would post it on their too. Just let me know thru a message and we can chat somewhere and figure it out :) good luck selling anyways!

				Real MDMA? Not Butylone or Methylone? I love both but some real MDMA would be sweet.<br /><br />If possible I&#039;d like to buy a second, don&#039;t want to roll alone lol.<br /><br />I would post a review to your vendor account as well as here.
