				hey guys just started using sr for last few weeks, mainly treating myself to a little splurge on heroin...<br /><br />last time I had used h before this was over a year ago but I had smoked a bunch of oxys at one point and had to go thru some pretty bad withdrawals just about 10 months ago but only ever smoked the h...<br /><br />Leaving uk for the states in a few days for some fun in the sun but no drugs, besides weed and occasional xanax<br /><br />As we speak I&#039;m experiencing some mild to moderate withdrawals but I am using a combo of otc codeine/nurofen pills and lots of weed and feel ok, wish these xanax I bought on here were working but they suck, which will lead me to my first vendor review...<br /><br />Chillzon3too-<br />This is the guy I got the C10 3.5 mg xanax from, I bought 20 for half a coin... was excited by the 3.5 dosage... first let me say the guy is not a scammer, I rated him 5/5 and would recommend him to other noobs... He had great reviews, but anyway this batch that he received were apparently no good, anyway good communications and full refund, didnt require fe and just canceled my order after I had already received the product... So sum it up would try him again<br /><br />fromonetoanother-<br />Bitcoin seller for uk on here, deposited Â£ straight into local bank acct, no name given nor needed by either party and always came thru perfect and expediently. definitely would recommend... Let me also write as a warning to other noobs and I&#039;ve already posted this when it happened to me, my first btc deposit was instantly stolen, I was tricked into a stupid phishing version of sr from a link that popped up on google. I admit now I&#039;m an idiot for falling for it and I entered my pin. Made a new acct and the vendor even agreed to sell me half his minimum purchase due to what happened just bc I was nervous about the first issue....<br /><br />Heroin- only used 2 vendors<br />I myself am not much of a user tbh, I like to go thru 2 week splurges like once a year but keep it strictly to smoking and try not to use more than 2 days without a 2 day break. I&#039;ve prob never used the premium pulp fiction gear in my life and never IV only smoke, snorted once in amsterdam. Cant become an addict it would just ruin my life so this is what works best for me to manage my life and my &quot;demons&quot;<br /><br />dispater-<br />Used him 4 times, I personally like his gear, way better than street and always lasted me a while, 1g lasted me from saturday afternoon till tuesday late night. Had to fe with him but was willing to risk on $40 or so purchase for half g first couple times. First couple orders were processed super quick and arrived next day on midday purchases. Last couple were kind of annoying and took like 24hours to show in transit but still arrived withing about 48hrs or 2 mail days. Def recommend<br /><br />theXchange-<br />Solid vendor. Instant responses and super fast shipping, stealth far more advanced than dispater, his gear is cheap and still good but slightly below dispaters for my personal taste on the foil but its also a descent amount cheaper and turnaround and comms were way quicker... def recommend also didnt have to fe which is nice<br /><br /><br /><br />sk0rt- <br />bought 10mg valium off him, blue ones by auprin, they were legit and did the trick for me, comms and turnaround two thumbs up. Didnt have to fe, only problem he&#039;s been out of stock ever since, would def recommend if he comes back. Stealth was descent.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ByronLugosi-<br />Just ordered a few subutex from him, didnt have to fe, hoping to receive tomoz, comms were great and he even added a free shipping option when I messaged him about the .08 btc shipping charge on a .15btc purchase. So far excellent and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll receive tomorrow or friday....<br /><br />Also did a few lotto purchases, didn&#039;t bink anything...<br /><br />Overall so far I have to agree with this chick I know who I showed the site to &quot;this is definitely one of the coolest things I&#039;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; I&#039;m personally surprised by how easy it is to send packages domestically uk-uk with royal mail. Overnight service from her majesty!<br /><br />Gonna take a&nbsp; break now from anything heavy, florida hurricanes and humidity with a bit of sun and women, probably a lot more booze and xanax in my near future. Hope some newby uk members find this useful <br />

				Good post should be useful for others, wouldn&#039;t recommend buying your BTC from SR though as there is no way to protect yourself.

				Sounds like a good experience, can&#039;t really go wrong with domestic orders so long as the vendor isn&#039;t a scammer

				thanks guys, I did put a bit of time into writing that so hope it helps one or two noobs....<br /><br />as far as chillzon3too, like I said, I can&#039;t call him a scammer as he refunded my money by cancelling the order, however, had I not tested product first before finalizing the transaction, I&#039;m not sure I would&#039;ve been so lucky...

				hi,<br /><br />Sounds cool,<br /><br />Im a noob to sr too &amp; also in the UK , god only knows why iv never stumbled across this site before but that&#039;s life.<br /><br />I really appreciate your post as i am really concerned about my fist purchases , in fact im so worried that although i sighed up a couple of weeks ago (on a dif account name , i changed it cos i remembered i had used that name once before somewhere (dum ass, lol)) i still have not actually attempted to buy anything.<br /><br />Iv spent my time debating with myself , should i should i not :-/ , but while im thinking about it iv been reading as much as i can and trying to make sure absolutely everything is as secure and encrypted as i can.<br /><br />Iv gained access to a neighbors wifi, spoofed my adapters MAC, separate computer that had its entire OS on a truecrypt volume,&nbsp; got a few VPN&#039;s to choose from &amp; TOR all sorted. (hope its enough).<br /><br />Because i am also in the UK I shall be checking out your vendors , i had a big habit for 12 years of my life but iv been clean for over 10 years now, just subutex &amp; zopiclone prescribed but not much.<br /><br />I think whats really stopping me, well another factor, is if its as easy as you say i could develop a problem again but on the other hand im a lot older now and i know full well the consequences of more than 2 ish days of using in a row.<br /><br />Anyhow, excellent write up, really helpful to me , has settled my mind a little about this last part of the whole puzzle (iv already found decent bc vendors for peeps in UK).<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />o yea forgot to ask, what did you mean when you said ?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">stealth far more advanced than dispater, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cheers,
