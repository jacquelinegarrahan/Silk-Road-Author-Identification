				If a package is intercepted and they flag the address do they also flag the name associated with it? Say you wanted to go get a private mailbox after such a thing happened, would it be subject to scrutiny also?

				In Australia intercepted mail is passed onto federal police. The names used are then placed on a database to be cross checked against the same name at other addresses. 35 search warrants were issued in Australia this week. 31 in Victoria alone.<br />It is a good idea to use real names and different ones for each receiving location.&nbsp; The Australian police are investing large dollars and man hours to combat criminal organizations using the mail to distribute drugs. Unfortunately the average SR user is getting caught up in the net. The judge made an example of an Australian vendor, they intercepted&nbsp; 46.9 grams of MDMA and 14.5 grams of cocaine all sent to the same 1 name.<br /><br />***************CLEARNET WARNING************************<br />http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/01/silk-road-crackdown<br />

Well damn, can anyone recommend a good fake ID vendor? lol<br />What about other names from the flagged addresses, I would assume they get flagged too.<br /><br />The shitty thing is I&#039;m not sure anything was ever intercepted, there was a mistake on the vendors end and the pack never left its point of origin and was returned to the return address that I understand is a real business. No idea what happened next so I&#039;m just going with LE knows just to be safe.

				Had the same problem ... Item didn&#039;t show <br /><br />So I made a few small bud purchases ... No problems !<br /><br />I suspect that&nbsp; mail redirect is implemented depending upon size and type of seizure.<br />It would be too much effort to divert the mail for every 1/4 oz detected ...&nbsp; <br /><br />Best idea is to find a trusted vendor and stick with them ... <br /><br />&quot;In our Vendors Stealth we Trust&quot;
