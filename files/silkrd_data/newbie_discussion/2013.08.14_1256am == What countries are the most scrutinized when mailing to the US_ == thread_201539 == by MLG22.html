				As the title states...What countries would Americans want to avoid on SR? Which countries packages raise the most red flags for the USPS? <br /><br />Which countries are the safest to order from? <br /><br />Any info is appreciated, as maybe this will give us something to talk about instead of just whoring to 50....

				I&#039;m from the UK but I would imagine most south American countries and the Netherlands would be most suspect for the USPS. Also maybe Spain and the UK.

				They&#039;re not like, &quot;This package is from XXXX country, let&#039;s check it more!&quot;.<br /><br />If anything they profile by packaging, if something &quot;looks&quot; like a drug package or just suspicious as hell (poorly wrapped, smeel eminating from box, stuff to stop x-rays inside) they will scrutinize it more heavily.

				Of the big SR origin countries here I&#039;d said Netherlands but it&#039;s not impossible NL-US so go with the vendor who has better stealth rather than pricing perhaps.

				Netherlands usually because of the large amount of cheap drugs you will find there probably ;) Anyways, as long as the shipping methods are up to par you will mostly be good. China is not that sketchy either. Many every day Americans are actually recieving packages from China currently due to the state of the economy and how good China&#039;s market is for EVERYTHING.

				china would probably be one of the best countries to order from as there is a vast amount of consumer goods being mailed from china on a daily basis. your package would be lost in a sea of electronics, clothing and all manner of other goods ordered on ebay and the internet. the Uk i would guess would have a lot of business mail coming and going from each country so it would be a similar situation. countries to avoid would be holland, columbia, mexico, bolivia, portugal, czech republic, afganistan, pakistan, india, thailand, vietnam, cambodia, burma, laos, morocco, turkey and any other country that is well known drug producing country or has very lax drug laws.

				What are ya looking for? Most products can be bought domestically, although I&#039;ve gone overseas myself a few times. I&#039;ve had no problems from Spain, Belgium, UK, Vietnam . I&#039;d worry bout anything from South America .

However, there aren&#039;t many vendors on SR from China. Probably because of the tough anti-drug laws there...
