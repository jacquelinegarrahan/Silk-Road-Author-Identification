				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/00c763f581<br /><br />This is me. Brand new vendor. Had the account for a few days but been lurking in stealth learning how to use PGP before I opened properly.<br /><br />If you have any suggestions as to what info or anything extra you&#039;d like to see on my page I&#039;m open to suggestions. <br /><br />Samples aren&#039;t free but the 1/4g listings is a decent compromise on this. <br /><br />It states clearly on my page that we aren&#039;t asking for FE but for the moment you can only buy if you have 10+ purchases. <br /><br />I&#039;m starting slow on here, if it goes smoothly I&#039;ll do larger listings. <br /><br />UV

				Why is it that coke samples from new vendors are usually still quite expensive? Real samples are either free, or charge for shipment only.<br />(And also as pure as later on, instead of being cut more and more over time).<br /><br />You&#039;d better get all of your information together really well before actually vending in order to not put yourself, but definitely not your customers, at risk.

I&#039;d recommend sending out some free or cheap samples as a testament of quality though and then once you get people vouching for you maybe you could offer small sample quantities at a lower price to keep new buyers attracted to your products. New buyers may not be as willing to commit, and small quantities at fair prices to sample do great for increasing confidence. That&#039;s something I noticed as soon as I got on here, prices are high even for small quantities. A skilled fisherman knows to put some bait in the water because he can afford it when the big fish spot the little fish nibbling and come around. Best wishes!

Because apart from Australia we are about as far away from the source as you can get, plus to get it here you have to go through several countries/stops and no doubt gets stepped on each time.&nbsp;

				I put the samples at cost because of the quality of the product and I don&#039;t have a lot to throw around. My plan was to start small on here and if it works out then I&#039;ll be willing to get more in to sell. The way I see it is that when sampling cocaine you need 1/4 of a gram to really sit down and have a few lines of it to solidly know you have good stuff. Now with my product there is no dirty cuts like base in that&#039;ll give you the jitters and as for purity it&#039;s always in the mid 80s to low 90s. And if it&#039;s crap then hey, you can rate me down but I know that wont happen. <br /><br />I&#039;ll see how it goes and if people are interested then I&#039;ll think about dropping the 1/4 prices a little just to get the word out. <br /><br />As for getting my info together that&#039;s what I&#039;ve done. I made several purchases from other top coke sellers to get ideas for packaging and stealth. The thing I&#039;m having a few troubles with is the meta data thing from pictures. Can anyone explain how to make sure this is removed? Then you can see what my gear looks like.

				Prices are a bit steep for samples, but agree that you need a good 0.25 to sample, none of this 0.1 business. Not so sure about the £5 postage charge for 1st class RM either tbh, must be some stealth.<br /><br />A good start though by researching other vendor&#039;s packaging methods and certainly for researching and getting gpg set up first, something that many new vendors are failing to do, so +1 to you for that. May well give you a try in the near future. :)

I know when I test any new coke I buy I always sit down with at least 1/4 to half a gram with a good buddy and both do lines and compare and discuss. That&#039;s the only way along with a good EZ Test kit. <br /><br />The price of the packaging will reflect the stealth, spent a lot of time adapting what I&#039;ve seen the other top dogs around here do and I have made sure it&#039;s good. I&#039;m boosting up the camera at the moment so there will be some pics soon to wet the whistle.

				mid 80&#039;s to low 90&#039;s purity is a pretty big claim. <br /><br /><br />I dont blame you for not sending out freebies, seems like a lot of moochers on the road. <br /><br />If your product is good the it will sell itself, without having to give it away for a good review. <br /><br />

				Didn&#039;t want to do the samples that low but from looking around the forum SR seems to be all about showing yours before theirs especially with cocaine. <br /><br />The claim is big yeah but I don&#039;t talk shit. You might have seen that my account is bout a month old but that&#039;s coz I did the research with the packaging and GPG seeing what everyone else has and mine deffo competes. I haven&#039;t seen anything that has the oily/tacky texture or smells like mine but then again, maybe I didn&#039;t look in the right place. We&#039;ll just see when the reviews come back.

				I will order a sample shortly and post a review. Often uk sellers are very pricey on here.... But less risk of a domestic seizure so it may be worth it. Good luck with your venture, always good to see more choice and product!
