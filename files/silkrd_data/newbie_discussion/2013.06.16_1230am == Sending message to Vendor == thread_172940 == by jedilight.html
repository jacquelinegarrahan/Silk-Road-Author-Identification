				If I don&#039;t encrypt a message will a vendor still receive?<br />I sent one without it since I don&#039;t know how to encrypt but he/she hasn&#039;t replied

				Don&#039;t encrypt normal messages to vendors unless it has sensitive information like your address, your location and such. Some vendors just don&#039;t answer sometimes. Go to sent messages and see if your message is still in bold. If it is, it&#039;s still unread. Also, if a vendor doesn&#039;t reply 10 minutes after you sent it it&#039;s OK! Sometimes it takes a day.

				yeah tree is right on<br />some vendors dont answer messages. this one dude i buy from, i have sent him several messages over our relationship and he has never responded to any lol<br />dont send sensitive information in plain text. encryption is pretty easy to learn. try gpg4usb (http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/) its very good for beginners with an easy to use interface. you can also use https://privnote.com/. no download or installation. you write your note on their website and then it supplies you with a link to send to the person you want to read your message. they open the link, read it and then the message is destroyed after 1 view. some people are paranoid about privnote,

Who do you trust more, SR admins or a company? SR is illegal in itself, they don&#039;t want to rat you out. Privnote on the other hand isn&#039;t like that, and I&#039;ve read that some vendors couldn&#039;t open some privnote links because it had already been opened. It doesn&#039;t sound secure to me.<br />If you send your address via a PM though, it&#039;s not such a bad idea to put it in a privnote link, because the vendor won&#039;t have access to your address anymore, whereas he would have to delete your PM himself to get rid of your address otherwise, something he&#039;d probably forget to do.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why people use privnote for addresses when SR&#039;s address field does exactly the same thing! It doesn&#039;t make any sense.
