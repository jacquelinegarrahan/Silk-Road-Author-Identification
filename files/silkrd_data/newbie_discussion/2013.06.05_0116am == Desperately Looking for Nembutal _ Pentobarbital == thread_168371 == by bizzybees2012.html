				I&#039;m looking for it as well. <br />It is my own business as to the why. <br />If you really want to argue, google whipple complications.<br /><br />Available just over the border in Mexico in veterinary shops with the following names:<br />Anestesal, Sedal-Vet, Pentobarbital injectable, Scdalphorte, Barbithal, Sedalpharma.<br /><br />As an aside, if provided the escrow will be completed prior to use. Otherwise would just be plain rude. I&#039;d get the stuff myself if I were able to do so.

				Emerald is legitimate.. He&#039;s had a lot of transaction and has great feedback on his page and on his review thread... I don&#039;t think cyanide is very difficult to acquire because it&#039;s really widely used in the chemical industry and it&#039;s easy to make yourself too without many skills. There&#039;s even a &quot;cyanide vendors review thread&quot; on here! You can check out lesseroftwoevils on the forums, I think the link to the thread is in his sig.

The only equipment you need is a vacuum flask and some tubing (I made it a few times back when I was studying chemistry).<br /><br />Get ahold of some Potassium Ferricyanide. This can be purchased on Amazon, or from photography suppliers (it&#039;s a nontoxic dye, and dirt cheap).<br /><br />React it with phosphoric acid over heat, and use the stoichiometric equivalents shown in the equation below:<br /><br />K3[Fe(CN)6] + 2 H3PO4 = 6 HCN + FePO4 + K3PO4<br /><br />Bubble the HCN into a solution of KOH or NaOH. You&#039;ll be left with a solution of NaCN/KCN and some leftover hydroxide. You can separate them with methanol (Cyanides are insoluble in it, but hydroxides are).<br /><br />Have fun.

Have you used them yourself peacepill?<br /><br />@jimmy, the vendor MedicalM had some real methaqualone, it had been lab tested by a third party in NL.. I placed an order the day the listing came online and after that they just disappeared :( Maybe they got busted. That&#039;s really too bad because I was really looking forward to getting those ludes. Googleyed sells some &quot;methaqualone&quot; but it&#039;s fake so don&#039;t buy :P
