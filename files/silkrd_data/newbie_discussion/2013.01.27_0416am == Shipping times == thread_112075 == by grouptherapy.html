				Is it common for there to be shipping delays from the same vendor the the same region of the US? I made an order 17 days ago with XTCExpress and still no shipment, yet I&#039;ve seen feedback left on his vendor page noting 10 day shipping to my same region. Am I worrying for no reason? or should I just be a little more patient?

				Just be patient. XTCExpress has a very good reputation, so you can be assured its on its way. Probably just took a little longer to get shipped. As long as you didn&#039;t FE, I&#039;d say you&#039;re in good shape.

				You&#039;re definitely not just being paranoid. Not including Sundays &amp; holidays, it very rarely takes more than 3 days for Priority mail to ship from coast to coast, &amp; five days for first class mail (aka &quot;normal people&quot;). If you haven&#039;t already done so,&nbsp; you should contact the vendor about this issue. Did you finalize early?

				Guys, he is ordering it from Germany or around there<br /><br />OP I have shipments from NL that always take 17 days or more and some that take 8 and others that claim 30 days, there are lots of factors that can happen when shipping international places more so from these places, Do not start to worry until at least 3 or 4 weeks have passed I personally use 4 weeks as my scam/lost alert.

				Yeah sorry for the confusion. I&#039;m expecting the shipment from Germany going to the west coast.<br /><br />FiddyPhysch: Yeah, I have no doubts about XTC. I am more worried about USPS.<br /><br />Ducksworth: Thank. I&#039;ll be patiently waiting now.

				I just had a tracked/sign order from AH make it after 40 days to east coast, it was looking grim with no update on tracking and the length of time, but it made it in the end.

				Did he provide tracking, if not ask him for it. <br /><br />Some vendors mark packages in progress while they will ship them out later.
