				Never really enjoyed spliffs. My friends like mixing with a good cigar once in a while. Not my thing, but I guess it attracts some people. Gimmie a blunt and we&#039;ll call it a day.<br />I&#039;ve got a really nice bowl nicknamed Squidward for his tentacle like build. I usually break him out with groups of people and use him for general smoking<br />I love my hookah! But never actually use cannabis in it, that&#039;s what bongs are for, silly! Chocolate Mint shisha is absolutely amazing and gives a great head rush.<br />Bongs are something I&#039;ll hit on occasion, again usually when with a group of people.<br />I have a MFLB and love it a lot. Great for head high&#039;s and it really lets you be in control of how high you actually get. The AVB is a plus, and I can get wrecked off of a few grams of it. Pretty potent stuff. It destroys my tolerance, however, so I find that I tend to have to take week long T-breaks to get back down to an acceptable level.<br /><br /><br />

				How about dugouts? Not sure if they go under another name, I guess its technically a pipe. Helps me stretch a bag out longer then just hitting a pipe. I also prefer the closed metal pipes with a small hole to light it instead of glass, keeps it from burning itself.

				I used to always be that guy who smoked only when a friend had some, but I decided to pick up my own gear recently. Started out with a pipe, then got a bong.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorta tempted to get a vape, as whenever I used to vape with a friend it was just so easy to do. Plus it&#039;s silent, sneaky and efficient. Problem is that it&#039;s expensive...

				Bit of an old technique from youthful crazy days, but HOT KNIVES anyone?<br /><br />We would get an empty glass wine bottle, put a tiny bit of cooking oil in, then heat up a metal table knife to red hot on the stove. Drop it in, wait a second, shake up and down and the bottom would fall out due to the heat stress. Then heat two knives up, your friend pops a tiny bit of hash on one, squeezes it between the two knives and you sucked the smoke up through the bottle.<br /><br />No wonder we didn&#039;t cop off with many women at parties, we would be too busy ruining the host&#039;s cutlery in the kitchen then passing out on the couch!

I do remember coming in to a friends house one day after he was up all night on dexies, and he had about 50 joints rolled on his desk. My eyes almost popped out of my head when he showed me!<br /><br />Another good memory with joints is when I was travelling Cambodia and we got offered joints for $1 USD. Wasn&#039;t the best weed, but they certainly got the job done once you were sitting on your balcony looking out over the ocean having a nice relaxing smoke. So I&#039;ll always have a nostalgic place in my heart for joints.<br /><br />Although the only downside with joints is that it&#039;s a bit of a waste.

				Its quite easy, so once you have your liquid green butter run it through the food processor with the sweated shallots and freshly chopped tarragon.<br /><br />It will firm up like whipped butter. then use a flexible spatula and scrape it out onto some rolled out seran wrap/cling film in an even length across and enclose.<br /><br />Roll it up to a cylinder shape, tie off the ends and refrigerate. then every time you have a nice grilled steak that&#039;s been properly rested, cut off a little disc and enjoy!<br /><br />If you need to add a splash of vinegar to prevent the butter from splitting in food processor.

				When a bit younger, used to do bucket bongs with friends. Very quick way to fuck you up. Gave a few friends a trial by fire intro to weed like that (as I too was introduced). All coped really well barring one who really did freak out a bit!

				Pretty much exclusively blunts, nice slow burn. I don&#039;t really care for vaporising, using bongs, pipes etc. because there&#039;s something I just love about constantly drawing smoke from a blunt. It feels like a more complete experience in a way.

				The Vape is the best high, but it is not the best if you want to get high right NOW. I hate having to wait for it to warm up. The best way to smoke weed is anyway you can...i.e. crushed coca cola can MacGyvere&#039;d to be a bowl, it will still get you high.
