				I haven&#039;t been on the forum long, but in reading all the Newbie mistakes, I&#039;m learning through this journey.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I would have seen so many mistakes if I spammed by thread count to 50 and moved on.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing my time here to learn, so I don&#039;t get scammed, in trouble, and buy hast fully.&nbsp; This is my approach, and I&#039;m think that&#039;s the reason we are asked to stay in this discussion thread.&nbsp; Just something I wanted to mention...

				As far as I&#039;m concerned the 50 post thing is irrelevant. I had, with but only a few posts here, researched many of the sellers who appeared to have good deals, found one I considered the best shot, and had a perfect, no-problem transaction. Just do your homework and read up about the do&#039;s and dont&#039;s of buying on the SR, and you are much more likely to have a good transaction, regardless of your post count here.

				I think that the 50 post is too high of a hurdle for newbies. I think that unscrupulous users can easily get around the 50 post limit by posting spam messages, but the ones who play by the rules will take longer to be able to be full members of the SR community.

I think that if you&#039;re putting in the time for the right reasons, you will get to 50 before too long anyway. Also, what does it really matter? You can post the same stuff on this thread as any other, and usually there are experienced members on this thread willing to help you out. So just do the time, and gain the knowledge. No big deal!!!

				Thanks MrChinoCat, that was exactly my point.&nbsp; Do the time, you might actually learn something....I wish I didn&#039;t make my 1st purchase until about the 25th response, around now. I would have not made a hasty decision on the purchase.

				Besides combating the obvious spammers, the admins are also trying to gently remind us to READ THE FAQ before you start throwing away your hard-earned money and risking your freedom.&nbsp; Everybody here thinks he&#039;s way smarter than average, and the rules were made for all those OTHER people, so everybody feels entitled to bypass the rules and spam their way out of here RIGHT AWAY so they can go straight to the main forums and ask:<br /><br />How do I buy Bitcoins?<br />What&#039;s PGP?<br />I FE&#039;d and got ripped off.&nbsp; What do I do now?<br /><br />Can you even imagine how tired Libertas is of seeing those posts?&nbsp; I bet he&#039;d be willing to try anything if it could just get a few more people to spend a few more minutes RTFM.

				You make a good point.&nbsp; I started posting in the spam threads when I first started my account just to get me started, but I&#039;d much rather take the time to learn some things and participate in real discussions here.&nbsp; The 50 post limit seems high, but I understand it&#039;s there for a good reason.

				as a newb myself I found the 50 posts annoying but perhaps not high enough. I&#039;m happy that there are hurdles to jump. The post limit doesn&#039;t limit your reading and learning, it doesn&#039;t limit your ability to purchase, and it doesn&#039;t prevent you from asking questions in the newbie forum. It does prevent a person like myself (inexperienced in SR matters) in jumping into a conversation way above my head and perhaps giving someone some bad advice that ends in disaster, as well as people creating spam threads (multiple duplicate threads for some scam) one of which I saw in the newbie forum last night.<br /><br />The only thing I found frustrating about it was that I couldn&#039;t ask questions in threads I came across in shipping and security. But this was often a 50/50 type of problem. Some times with more searching I would find my question asked by someone else and an answer posted, sometimes I wouldn&#039;t find any advice on my particular concern. I used a spam thread (along with legit posts and questions in the newbie forum) to get to my 50. For the time being there was/is no real reason for my to post in the other forums. I&#039;ll keep reading them and keep posting in the newbie forum where most of my concerns deserve to be voiced. If I come across something specific now I have the option to ask it which is nice. <br /><br />Then again I suppose I&#039;m a &quot;look before I leap&quot; type of person as apposed to the people on here that jump in head first and want to leave feedback etc.

				I do think 50 posts is a lot to get outta the newbie forums cause I can find very little actual(not spam) topics to reply to in here.<br />and dont have many questions as I read every thing I could before really starting off,....<br />But Iv come to the conclusion I must just post on stop being antisocial and find something to gain from being stuck in the newbie forums filled with spam and small talk lol but insight can be found in this section just takes some sifting through

				I spend all my time reading and forget to post. Haven&#039;t ordered yet, but I am cleaning up my pc from when I first used Tor and bookmarked something I now know I shouldn&#039;t have. Without the 50 post thing I don&#039;t know if I would had still waited before ordering, but it is a useful reminder of how little I know about something potentially dangerous. Plus it takes five attempts to post anything, what with captcha and then the &quot;less than a second ago&quot; bollocks.
