				I&#039;ve been hearing a lot of rumors about flaws in the Tor networks that would soon be exposed.<br />I fear those may soon be coming to light, with the tightening of cybersecurity because of some self fulfilling prophecy which will lead to WWIII. In times like this I turn to my true community for answers, The Internet.<br />Not to mention this helps explain why Tor has been running slower than normal the past couple weeks/months(Quadrupled traffic). I suggest you take a couple more precautionary steps to make it even harder to locate your address/IP. Nowadays anonymity is fast becoming a thing of the past, lets be the generation to change that!<br /><br />The link below is what re-sparked my interest in these flaws. (Not a repost surprisingly, from what I can surmise.)<br /><br />gizmodo(dot)com/the-anonymous-internet-is-under-attack-1257343241?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_source=gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow<br /><br /><br />Just trying to do my part in spreading awareness. <br />God bless you all. <br />Namaste.<br />TGG

				Ok just take a deap breath and remember as long as your not ordering 5 kilo&#039;s of coke and selling it to every average joe on the block no one will come out to get you. That being said the article that has you all worked up doesn&#039;t say anything about anyone directly attacking TOR it seems that this russian guy is using TOR to communicate with his botnet and its generating a SHIT ton of traffic. The only thing being directly attacked it seams is anonymous email services which is why always always always use pgp. I wouldn&#039;t worry to much TOR is completly safe for the moment ever sense the botnet started generating traffic a lot of people have been making relays to balance it out. Things should settle down in a week or two if not no big deal TOR was never really fast in the first place.

The &quot;flaw&quot; I was trying to refer to, which m1nutman pointed out, its not so much a flaw, more like a negative characteristic of the system. The network doesn&#039;t have enough nodal relay points to even out the workload. In a sense, it feels like TOR is being DDoS&#039;d.

				WW3 has already started a few years ago..<br /><br />You just don&#039;t know about it yet since the war is against us all and the attacks is done thru air, water and food.<br /><br />There is ways to protect yourself but who would listen to that when you still believe the media and governments tells the truth about anything?<br /><br />

				I read about when WW3 was going to start in the book The bible code, since they found dates and names on everything that&nbsp; changes history for humanity by decrypting the bible, either the most high or lucifer wrote it.. <br /><br />So I had the date when WW3 was going to start, and I was watching the news that morning and there was muslims getting angry about a newspaper in Denmark because they printed some picture of their prophet Mohammed in their papers.<br /><br />its already written what is going to happen. I guess humanity could stop it but we dont.<br /><br />Prophecies is just there to show humanity the future if we continue on the same path so everyone has a chance to change the path, most people don&#039;t change their paths tho and the prophesies will come true. =(<br /><br />people want the world to change but nobody want to change the world by changin themselves..<br /><br />Politicians will not stop any wars since the wars is how they keep theit power over people, divide and conquerer humanity.<br /><br />humanity was a easy target when a system like this where the few controlls the many, we dont even know if they are humans or if they are just psycopaths, they could be controlled by aliens that hate humanity and loves when a war starts and some bombs are dropped on some childrens heads..<br /><br />

				Most people already have the mark of the beast in their forehead since that is when you calcify your pinealgland by drinking tapwater filled with flouride and using toothpaste containing flouride and chewing-gum containing flouride..<br /><br />The second mark of the best is the microchip Obama is promoting and you will get the chance to become a millionair by putting the second mark of the beast inside your arm. Thru the NESARA-project.<br /><br />The revelations part of the bible is true according to the evidences shown now, and the rest is mostly bullshit, so the prophecies are true in there and the evidences show it but people still will not listen.. They know the slaceowners are the highest power in this world and fiatmoney is the meaning of life so they will put the second mark of the beast inside their arm with ease since they gets to become millionair and they can use the money to do good in the world, thats what lucifer wants you to think since he wrote it on the NESARA page.<br /><br />So good luck if you are one of those who think life is all about shutting your eyes to everything negative since your life will get boring if you know when lucifer is killiing you.<br /><br />It&#039;s ridiculus if you ask me. humanity is ridculus at this point and they dumbed down beyond belif =(

				Its aliens tho that have enslaved humanity thru a slaveconomy..<br /><br />For you enlightened n awake people, you have to stop eating animals, let the animals be free and you will get real freedom. Since the karma created by eating animals will make shure you get eaten and stays here when this planet goes under.<br /><br />activate the third eye, stop creating karma and start rising the frequency in the body by eating living foods and in 4 years portals will open to the new Earth in 5th dimension and in 7 years the portals close an the planet goes under.<br /><br />Its going to get crazy down here so get going instantly if you still care about yourself and life.<br /><br />I know most sheeple dont care about the airplanes spraying the sky above them , they afraid to get killed if they talked about the ones killing them at the moment. So they will not make it. =(
