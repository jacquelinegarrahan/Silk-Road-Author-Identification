				Just wondering if anyone on the Road has ever made opium poppy tea from dried pods? Please share your experience with me. A couple months ago I measured out 10g of dried poppy pods ( I grow Tasmaniun high alkaloid pharmaceutical opium poppies), ground them super fine, steeped them in hot hot water, strained and drank. About 5 minutes later I had this warm flush come over me then it passed. 30 to 40 minutes later I felt slightly nauseous and it too passed in about 45 min. I didn&#039;t get sleepy either. I am wondering if I drank enough? I want to use it for chronic pain relief, I would rather use Nature&#039;s natural pain medication. I have done lots of research, reading an ebook &quot;Opium for the Masses&quot;, read &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&quot;, and read &quot;Opium Fiend&quot; But I would like to hear of others opinions and real life experiences. I havn&#039;t seen that much on Erowid&#039;s Vault either thanks, SunQueen

				I haven&#039;t tried tea yet, I just toss the shit in my mouth and wash it down.&nbsp; You save a lot of pods this way as its more efficient and the effects will last longer.&nbsp; I think you cut the dose from tea in half or something, i could be wrong though because I havent done the tea method yet but you definitely are supposed to use less.

				Were you aware that in Tazmania they grow many types of poppies and they&#039;re not all just high alkaloid types?<br />&nbsp;They also grow a type that has a very high thebaine content. These they use the thebaine from to make oxycodone. Problem is that thebaine won&#039;t get you high cause its gotta be chemically converted into oxycodone. Thats not going to happen inside your body by pure luck. The poppies in Tazmania used to get ripped off by the local waste cases by the shitload until the last few years came along when the company that grows em brought out this high thebaine/low codeine type that&#039;ll fuckin kill you long before you&#039;re buzzin and now very few of the local junkies ever dare to steal them anymore for fear of death since it&#039;s impossible, I repeat, impossible to tell the difference between the various types of poppies they&#039;re growing. <br />Not even the farmers know which are which and teenage kids get lowered from the front page headlines of the local paper into their early graves every year as the news slowly filters out that TAZMANIAN HIGH ALKALOID TYPE POPPIES WILL FUCKING KILL YOU.<br />But they ain&#039;t gonna put that on their SR ad now are they?

				Why not harvest the opium from the pods? There are lots of tutorials on this online. Basically you score the pod with a sharp knife in the morning, let the opium&nbsp; bleed out, and then scrape it off the pod later in the day. Do this every day until there&#039;s no more. Collect all the opium in a jar or something, and there you have it. Eat it, smoke it, whatever.<br /><br />There are many alkaloids in opium. One of them makes you nauseous. Many are pain relievers. There is a chemical process for separating out each alkaloid. If you are truly interested in refining your own drugs from raw opium, again, there are a lot of guides on this online... it will require a chemical that is difficult to get without attracting the DEA&#039;s attention, though.
