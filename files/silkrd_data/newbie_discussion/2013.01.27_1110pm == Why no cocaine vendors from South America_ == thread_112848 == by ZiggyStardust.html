				I&#039;d guess most your big sellers in SA already have enough connections to bank and don&#039;t need to use SR at all. They already have a system set up.

				Well there was one guy Kobletz or something like that who was trying to ship from Columbia. Problem is that only 1-30 packages made it or so I think that&#039;s over now.

				there have been a number of them.&nbsp; They are generally scammers.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t trust my money to one.&nbsp; Maybe La Fuente.&nbsp; He seems to be legit, though he&#039;s not from South America so i guess that&#039;s kinda off topic..

				I think in the future we may have more cocaine vendors from South America as silk road gains popularity and to be honest I think in the long run most are gonna fail miserably unless they come up with some extraordinary stealth measures or redirect their mail.Buyers that can afford to burn there drop address and won&#039;t be required to FE are gonna be stepping up to the plate. Obviously most larger shipments are abroad ships. Anyhow for those that don&#039;t know it cocaine only costs less than $5 a gram when bought in decent quantities. so profit margins could be huge

				Most South American countries are known suppliers of cocaine, therefore when a package comes from places like Columbia customs will already assume there might be cocaine in there and look a little harder for it. It&#039;s not very likely your cocaine will show up if ordered from a known cocaine producing country.<br /><br />Besides, as soon as cocaine hits US soil its value goes up tenfold (or something like that, maybe more I don&#039;t know), why would they sell it in a place where it&#039;s worth less? For the most part, prices on Silk Road reflect the country that the drug comes from, not where it&#039;s going.

				Australia has street prices for cocaine around 300-350.<br /><br />The product is generally 30% pure. This means getting a gram for less than $50 delivered can be stepped on pretty hard and make 2.5/3 grams for sale. <br /><br />You&#039;re damn straight the profit margin can be huge.

I was part of Koltbiz original sample test group, his coke was outstanding in my opinion both for the quality and price, and his stealth was the best I&#039;ve ever seen, I look forward to trying his new batch when he&#039;s up and running again :)
