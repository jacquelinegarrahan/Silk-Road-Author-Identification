				Well it just so happens I&#039;ve had a little light bedtime reading, or perhaps a chapter or so in the afternoon over a nice cup of tea before tickling down to the village green to bowl an over or two and knock the ball for six at Stowley-on-the-mound Cricket Club.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a rather jolly little pamphlet called the ILUMINATUS TRILOGIES....

Some of the BEST description of the experience of being on different drugs that I have EVER encountered. Not sure if you&#039;re there yet, but the scene where Erdedy is waiting for his pot dealer to call him back--this was literally the perfect evocation of what I used to feel like when I had to &quot;wait for my dealer to call.&quot;<br /><br />Now I have SR :) Muahahah<br /><br />And, knowing after Wallace&#039;s suicide that he abused drugs heavily in his 20s, one can only marvel how his amazing brain still put this book out. <br /><br />Don&#039;t quit on the book if you feel like it&#039;s dragging. It&#039;s a book to be lived with and not necessarily just read straight through. When I read it, I was at the height of my cocaine binging and this was a book that literally saved my life in that it sort of explained my life back to me. Wallace manages to nail not only all the things I found (still find) wrong and fake about the world, but he also shows us the myriad ways in which we try to escape, and how ultimately difficult it is to be genuine, compassionate, and kind in a world that more often encourages irony and cynicism.<br /><br />Many of my friends have heaped scorn on him (&quot;overintellectual&quot; &quot;full of himself&quot; &quot;gimmicky&quot;), not understanding that Wallace understood that life in modern America is hard, confusing, and disjunctive, and that a novel that sought to address this must necessarily itself be hard, confusing, and disjunctive. In a way, the book reads US as much as we read the book. There is virtually no way you can finish reading this book and be the same person as when you started it.<br /><br />Enjoy him. It&#039;s too bad he left us so soon.

Some of the BEST description of the experience of being on different drugs that I have EVER encountered.

I think I&#039;ve read about 80% of his work and it&#039;s mostly exceedingly well written and a pleasure to read.&nbsp; I have an audiobook of Consider the Lobster that he reads himself, which is great; his pacing really lends well to the style of his prose. That should be easily found on torrent sites if you haven&#039;t ran into it yet. <br />Anyway, I&#039;m planning on tackling IJ again this summer and finally getting around to The Pale King after I&#039;ve finished 1Q84 and The Tunnel. <br />I&#039;ve also collected pdfs of essays written on his work in two special issues of a journal called Studies in the Novel that were recently published.&nbsp; If you have access to university databases it&#039;s volume 44 and issues 3/4.&nbsp; (EDIT: If you don&#039;t, I could probably find a way to splice them all into one PDF and link them to you through PM if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; PM me if you do.&nbsp; I just need to find a way to cut the title pages from them because they reveal which school&nbsp; I go to and when I accessed them, which I&#039;d rather not have linked to my account here in any way.)

				I&#039;d honestly suggest reading them, it was well worth the trip. Best developed characters/magic system I&#039;ve ever found in fantasy. Everyone I know who&#039;s read the whole series read the final book in one sitting. It&#039;s damn good.

I reread the whole thing partially 3 times waiting for books to come out to refresh my memory each time a new one was released. Read the first one when I was around 12, finished the last one this year, pretty surreal experience finishing a series like that. Hands down the best fantasy series ever written IMO, Robert Jordan is incredible with the thought and care he put into building that universe and the relationships between SO MANY critical characters.<br /><br />Just started reading Infinite Jest today, thanks to everyone who recommended it, I&#039;ll post what I think when I finish it.
