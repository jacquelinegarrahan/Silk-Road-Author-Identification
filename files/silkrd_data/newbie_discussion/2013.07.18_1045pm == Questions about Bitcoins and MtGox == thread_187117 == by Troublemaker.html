				Ive been reading and doing the research. But Im new to this and I want to get it right.<br /><br />The way I understand it. I can have &quot;funds&quot; in my MtGox account that arent necessarily BTC. I can have dollars in the account and trade them for BTC as needed, thus protecting my money from the wild market fluctuations that the BTC experiences. Is this correct?<br /><br />Next up, &quot;verified&quot; accounts. I thought the whole purpose of the BTC was to create an anonymous currency. But now they want ID&#039;s? Am I required to verify my account to use MtGox? Or is that only a requirement for me to withdraw my &quot;funds&quot;? If I leave the &quot;funds&quot; in my account and say purchase gold bullion online with it will this negate the need to get &quot;verified&quot;?

You can deposit bitcoins and money into your Mt Gox account without verifying, but you can&#039;t do anything with them. I&#039;m not sure I understand your question regarding &#039;funds&#039; and gold but pretty much just assume without verifying you won&#039;t be able to do anything of interest.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck Mt Gox, btc is a decentralised currency, having some monolithic entity like Mt Gox monopolising trade is antithetical to the whole&nbsp; concept. There are anonymous options, and more coming, AB.

				Localbitcoins is okay if you want to pay ~10% fees (that&#039;s what they usually are in my area).<br />BlueSkyTraders are amazing IF they&#039;re up, which they&#039;re not right now.<br />BitInstant requires a phone number and MoneyGram, but you get your coins fast and the fee is reasonable (~4%). There&#039;s also the problem of a $500 transaction limit, which you can avoid by making deposits at multiple locations, but that&#039;s a lot of driving. They also have to be up, which they&#039;re not right now.

				I don&#039;t pay anywhere near 10% with localbitcoins but it depends on your location I suppose.

				Damn, Ive got a lot to learn....<br /><br />Localbitcoins isnt going to work. At least not right now. Closest vendor is 80 miles away and on an island&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I was under the impression that Gox was a one stop shop. Apparently this isnt the case though. Im looking at OnionWallet right now. Seems like it does basically the same thing, other than the BTC&#039;s have to come from somewhere else. <br /><br />All advice is appreciated, and any input should be geared toward someone that knows nothing so far. Because I know thats where I am. <br /><br />Once this is all figured out, my intent is to become a vendor.

				Bitinstant and Coinbase are two others I have used but the former has become a hassle though quick and the latter is a hassle and takes four days.

You place your order with localbitcoins who then take btc deposited by seller and store it in escrow, like SR. You give localbitcoins your wallet address when making order, deposit cash over counter at a bank, localbitcoins releases coins from escrow to your wallet.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Forget Gox, it is the focus of investigation by a number of corporate, national and international bodies threatened by bitcoin, AB.

				LocalBitcoins bank deposit through a seller is really one of the better ways. You can also do moneygram, cash in mail, check, etc. The choice is yours. Personally I just do moneygrams at this place down the road that doesn&#039;t ask for ID and slap a fake name and number down. <br /><br />TheGiant

				Ok. Gox is out the window then. Sounds like its the wrong route to go. Only reason I went there to begin with was because it was the only resource I knew about. Im finding others now. Its amazing what kind of doors get opened with a couple of comments, links, and new terminology.<br /><br />I just found this link;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112029.0<br /><br />I havent read it yet, but it seems like a lot of my questions can be answered there. <br /><br />I appreciate the help guys
