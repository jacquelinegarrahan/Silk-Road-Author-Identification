				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had any reasons to ask any questions about the SR. I just recently placed an order from this new vendor &quot;HappyEnding.&quot; Again, a new vendor and offered USPS or FedEx shipping options. I chose FedEx and he said it is in transit, however, they experienced some problems when sending out the order. Said the FedEx systems were down when they tried to ship so ended up shipping UPS because there was a UPS store close by. <br /><br />All of this is plausible, but I&#039;m just not sure. I had it shipped to a FedEx location for a hold for pickup. Done this before without problems so I thought it would still be okay. <br /><br />Another thing that hit me as usual was they wrote Did I do good?&quot; at the end of the message they sent letting me know it had shipped.<br /><br />Again, this is a new vendor so I&#039;m not sure how much to chalk up to inexperience.<br /><br />Not sure on what to do with this one and if I should go get it from UPS. My spidy senses are tingling, but it could still all be fine. <br /><br /><br />Please let me know what you would do and/or think I should do here.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Personally I don&#039;t like anything but USPS, unless it&#039;s something relatively legal.

I apologize for causing you to doubt or stress about the change in logistics of the order. When I messaged you the day I shipped the order to see if you would accept 5 extra pills if I could ship it out the day after, and you said you really preferred that it went out that day, so when FedEx said they were unable to process any shipments I had to make a choice and fast because time was running out. So I opted to ship UPS next day air to get you your order on time, and I really didn&#039;t think you would mind if it were FedEx or UPS since I was paying all the shipping costs. <br /><br />As for my comment, &quot;Did I do good&quot;, was simply an attempt at sarcasm, guess it wasn&#039;t funny.

				I don&#039;t know don&#039;t get me wrong the postal service SUCKS! But their is a reason for this madness they are unable to open your package without a search warrant because it is a government agency. Fedex and UPS are private companies there for you are not offered the same protections. <br /><br />I would highly recommend for safety&#039;s sake you stick with USPS even though their delivery time and turn around SUCKS! 8)
