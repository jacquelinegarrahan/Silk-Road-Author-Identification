				Did your friend ever enter his PIN when logging in? If so he logged into a scammer site and the BTC are gone. I don&#039;t think SR will reset a password; since it&#039;s anonymous, how could they possibly know if it were a legitimate request?

				Thanks very much for the fast answer. Your right but my friend can tell SR what stands in his mails and what he ordered. The problem is because of 13 bitcoins on his account.
