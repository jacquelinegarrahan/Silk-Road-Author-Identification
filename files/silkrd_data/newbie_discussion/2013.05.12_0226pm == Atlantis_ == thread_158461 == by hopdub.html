				Does anyone know if a reputable person started this site? How does anyone know it is not just a honeypot set up by LE? I personally have never been there and only heard about it. I am just curious though.

				There&#039;s no proof that Atlantis is a big LE operation. There&#039;s no proof that it isn&#039;t.<br /><br />All I know is that a couple of SR vendors are over there as-well as here. They expanded after the recent DoS attacks, so they could continue trading.<br /><br />Personally I won&#039;t be using Atlantis. I&#039;ve got no reason to.<br /><br />But to answer your question, no-one knows who started it or why.<br />Chances are it&#039;s just another site that facilitates the sale of drugs. Just like Silk Road.

Sure I could suggest a few little tweaks which would make it better for me, but SilkRoad is a tried and tested method who hasn&#039;t run off with my money or been unreasonable so taking the risk of that happening by using another site just isn&#039;t neccersary if you ask me. I&#039;m happy here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>^^^ amen +1 to u sir. plus it has more than any others

				True, any vendor could be a honey pot but LE typically likes to try to move up the supply chain and not down.

This site is not a honeypot. And yes, LE does want to move up the chain. What better way then to start another site like this and get big vendors to use it. I guess it is still anonymous is the&nbsp; right precautions are taken. I was just curious if Atlantis was started by someone with a rep already somewhere or not. <br /><br />You are all correct with your comments. Nice feedback, thanks.

				SR is safer than buying or selling drugs on the street. Anyone can be an informant. LE has an army of them!<br />Not sure about Atlantis, there is a rule in business it goes like this: Where there is profit there will be competition. <br />It makes sense that competitors would compete with SR for some market share. It&#039;s good to have more than one option if SR goes down.<br />I have full faith in DPR and crew!!! I will be here as long as SR is running!<br /><br />Thanks DPR! You da MAN!!!<br /><br />
