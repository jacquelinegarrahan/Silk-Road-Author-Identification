				Hi guys. I&#039;m new to this, first time ever using the site. Earlier today, I bought 0.5 BitCoins from a seller on BitBargain, because I&#039;m in the UK. All went smoothly, and I got the coins. I then sent the 0.5 coins from my wallet, to my Silk Road address. This was over 8 hours ago, and still, nothing&#039;s shown up. It says in the FAQ that the max it should take is six. When I click the transaction on BlockChain, it says &quot;74 confirmations&quot;. I don&#039;t even know what this means, all I know is that it&#039;s gone from my wallet, but isn&#039;t in my Silk Road account. I&#039;ve checked my account on here too, nobody has hacked my account and withdrawn it or used it, it just hasn&#039;t went in at all. Not exactly a great start to my first time on the site, can someone please help me out? Thanks!

				As long as you used the proper deposit address, it should show up around the 6th or 7th confirmation. Double check this. Also, the address you sent to -- you can see the ending balance on blockchain and whether or not the input was spent.

				If all that pans out, I think there is some sort of support system on SR. I haven&#039;t really checked. You would likely provide them with the TXN ID and go from there. I&#039;ve yet to lose any coins.

				I have 75 confirmations now man, and it&#039;s still not there... I don&#039;t know what the TXN ID is either. I&#039;m a complete noob, first time on here! Even though I&#039;m a noob to Silk Road, I&#039;m fairly computer wise though... Never had any problems like this before.

				When I went into my account, I hit &quot;Click here to make a deposit&quot;, and used the address that comes up then. Is that the right one?

				I&#039;ve just searched my Silk Road address on BlockChain, and it says there&#039;s 0 transactions?! I don&#039;t understand this at all, cause I copied and pasted the address (so it was 100% accurate), and the coins have left my wallet?!
