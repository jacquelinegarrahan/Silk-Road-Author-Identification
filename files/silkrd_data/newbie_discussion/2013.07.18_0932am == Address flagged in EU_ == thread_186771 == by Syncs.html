				I ordered small amount of weed from Holland and it didn&#039;t arrive, big surprise right. The vendor had one of the best feedback I&#039;ve seen so I thought it&#039;s worth the risk with those prices, but I was wrong. Now my question is, could my address be flagged? I was thinking about ordering 1g and testing it. I didn&#039;t use my real name btw(haven&#039;t had any issues before).

				I dunno, man, if it&#039;s worked fine before. I mean sometimes shit does just get lost in the mail, I&#039;ve had a few parcels of normal retail products from normal eBay use not arrive before or be sent back to the sender for no reason. If it&#039;s small amounts doubt anyone would be too interested in pursuing it too far anyway.

				its different in Uk. i get post from about the previous 4 residents still. and just about every squat i&#039;ve got into over the years has had a big pile of mail sitting inside the door. the postman just posts whatever the address says.<br /><br />it must suck in the US if they only post letters with the current occupiers name on it. what if you had someone over to stay for a while and they needed mail? the postman is not gonna deliver coz he doesn&#039;t recognize the name or what?

				Yeah, in the UK the name is actually not a huge deal. But be careful, if you have it sent to a previous resident it&#039;s not impossible that resident will have set up a forwarding scheme at the post office. They might end up with your gear!<br /><br />On-topic, I sent some weed from the Netherlands to a friend in the UK. The stealth was abysmal. I was new! It stank and it got caught. She got a delay on ALL her mail for several weeks after that, but after that mail went back to normal.<br /><br />She was kind of annoyed at me for screwing up her mail, but forgave me because my intentions were pure (as in pure THC).

				UK addresses are not flagged subjectively speaking.<br /><br />Without too much detail I ordered a stream of packs from EU first batch no problem then a few seized and resulting Love Letters the remaining were then received (all posted over a 7 day period). All addressed to the same person (fake name) and same delivery address.<br /><br />I still use that address but less frequently and not had a Love Letter in many years.<br /><br />

Strangely how i managed to get packages from all around the world from silkroad (netherland included many times). About 40 that was at this time. Every single one came in. Meanwhile i had about 10 orders from ebay and two didnt come in. lol.

				Thank you all for your answers. I think I will take a small break from the road, maybe find someone else who I can use as drop point.
