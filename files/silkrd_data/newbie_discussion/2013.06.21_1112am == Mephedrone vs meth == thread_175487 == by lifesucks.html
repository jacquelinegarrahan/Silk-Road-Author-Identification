			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve used mephedrone many times, both pre-ban and post ban, and found the euphoric rush when snorted quite unique. I&#039;ve never tried meth (but have ready plenty to know of its potential dangers) but am curious, and my question is how does the high of these two compare? Is the meth high similar to a much longer lasting meph high? I generally prefer snorting stims so would probably choose this ROA for meth too.

IM as delivery is a great clean way to get a good standard substance to the system. Avoids the stomach, which sometimes doesn&#039;t react well. and you get more bang for less substance. You will find many don&#039;t like needles - but they are cheap and very efficient. You must check that the substance is high purity and is soluble in water or water/alcohol. Obviously, less easy at the vicar&#039;s tea party...

				thanks for the reply. I have never used needles and doubt I will, no value judgment, just out of my comfort zone. I&#039;m still not sure how these two compare though. I find good meph very moreish, but due to the relatively short duration of effects I can usually sleep after a session. from what I hear this would not happen with meth.

IM is really straightforward with some basic hygiene, and gives an incomparably better experience, so I do recommend trying to get over the dislike of the idea, which I had too...<br />The main thing is to use drugs that are fully soluble and as pure as you can get them. Obviously the old legal regime was ideal, but the last stuff I had from Symbiosis is very good.

				Hey LS I&#039;ve tried them both and your avatar and name says it all. Both those chemicals cause too much depression and wear and tear on the body. Mephedrone is a completely bull shit research chemical and meth is a death wish. Do yourself a favor and get you some adderral at least it&#039;s regulated and gives you plenty of energy and helps reduce appetite if needed<br /><br />yea mephedrone don&#039;t hold a candle to the sleep deprivation caused by good clean ice
