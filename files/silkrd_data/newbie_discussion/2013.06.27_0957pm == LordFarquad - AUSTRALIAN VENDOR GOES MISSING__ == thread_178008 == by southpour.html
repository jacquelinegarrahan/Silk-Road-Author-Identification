				So this is my 50th post, I figured I should bring up something interesting. I don&#039;t feel has been covered very well - or my search function was playing up? But just a couple of weeks ago a high volume Australian Vendor vanished... <br /><br />A few months back quite a few new Australian Vendors started popping up peddling various products, in what seemed to me like a a sudden influx of new Australian domestic vendors. One of the popular ones appeared to be LordFarquad (stats below):<br /><br />LordFarquad<br />has been a vendor for 1 month<br />was last seen: 15 days ago<br />has 97.9% positive feedback - from approximately 300 transactions<br />Above score still in the high 90&#039;s after many orders never made it to their destination. No customers lost any money, SR resolved all orders left pending in escrow, and most customers left scores of 1/5.<br /><br />Some more information on LordFarquad, he sold very competitively priced weed, some speed and various other lower turn over products. In two weeks 300 transactions is pretty impressive turnover, the vendor&#039;s disappearance was of no financial gain, its not a story of a simple scam and I definitely believe there is more to this than meets the eye. <br /><br />Plenty of return customers have indicated it could be a LAW ENFORCEMENT (LE) issue, and this would be my guess also however one has to wonder how a vendor falls victim to LE if he has no exposure outside of SR? And what his LE issues might mean for those who have completed past transactions with him? I know the AFP would love to cause problems on the road to deter further uptake from Australian&#039;s and I am just mindful that resources could potentially be spent pursuing Australian SR users to create noise and increase the risk of being a humble buyer.<br /><br />Personally I did not do any trade with LordFarquad, so I am not concerned in that sense. However I do note this as significant and don&#039;t think it should be dismissed or taken lightly. I understand there are possibly other dynamics that play a part in LE busting someone such as a real physical drug dealing operating parallel to their SR business etc. As this is a community I believe everyone should do what they can to warn others of potential trouble and really feel this is something missing that could be beneficial in these type of circumstances. <br /><br />Should we be put more pressure on vendors to protect themselves better? <br /><br />Do all vendors need to have a back up plan so information gets back to the road if they go down?<br /><br />I welcome peoples thoughts and insight on this topic
