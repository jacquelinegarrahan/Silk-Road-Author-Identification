				So I&#039;ve sampled a good deal of the #4 H available domestically. I thought you guys might be interested in hearing my opinions on different vendors gear/service.<br /><br />DieselTherapy 3/5<br /><br />So I ordered a half g of DT&#039;s cheap H. <br /><br />Shipping: 2/5<br />I placed an order on a Saturday, priority. He marks my product in transit on monday which was cool. Then on wednesday he messages me saying he lost my adress and I had to give it to him again which I did. I expected extras for the delay but alas none came. So I expected to get my package by saturday, but DT didn&#039;t actually ship until thursday, so I received it on monday. Overall took like 8-9 days for a priority package which is okay, but not what I like.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Mylar was used which was a pleasant surprise. Overall stealth was fine for domestic.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />DT promptly answered all my PM&#039;s.<br /><br />Quality: 1/5 <br />Now here&#039;s the problem. I started off with a 150mg line snorted and felt almost nothing. So I opted for a 150mg shot, once again almost nothing, so I did another 200mg shot. Achieved a small buzz after using ALL of the product. Maybe his new stuff is better but that cheap H is NOT worth the price.<br /><br />Dragoncove 5/5<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 2 g&#039;s from DC and he is definitely a reliable vendor both took 2 days after being marked intransit to reach my hands. Don&#039;t hesitate to give him your business if you&#039;re looking for a gram shipped priority M-F. <br /><br />Shipping: 5/5<br />Ordered on a monday, was in transit by tuesday, in my hands friday because thursday was 4th of July. For free priority that&#039;s pretty sweet.<br /><br />Communication: N/a<br />Never had to send him any messages.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Was well done for domestic.<br /><br />Quality: 5/5<br />I&#039;ve had mixed results with the quality. The first gram I got from him was ridiculously potent. Smelled super dank and was overall just amazing. The second g I got was the same stuff but I ordered right when he took down the listing so it seemed like my g was cut. It had the same smell but was way fainter and didn&#039;t dissolve as cleanly. <br /><br />GIA 5/5<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5<br />Express is always overnight.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />Always quick to reply and courteous.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Equal to DC&#039;s<br /><br />DC or GIA are my go to guys. GIA is a little more expensive but quicker.<br />

				I just placed an order with dieseltherapy and did his FE option to get an extra 20% free.&nbsp; but as soon as I FE&#039;d the product I ordered was taken off the list.&nbsp; So either I got some of the last stuff, or its possible I&#039;m getting screwed.&nbsp; Has anyone else had good experiences with DT out there?
