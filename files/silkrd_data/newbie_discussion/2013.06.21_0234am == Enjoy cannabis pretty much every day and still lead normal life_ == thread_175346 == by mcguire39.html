				Is it possible to enjoy cannabis pretty much every evening and still live a basically normal life? Like hold down a job, have friends, etc? Or am I just deluding myself? I guess I could take some time off now and then if I had something else to substitute or rotate in.

				I managed to hold down a job and keep my circle of friends while being a very heavy marijuana user (4-8 bowls daily, wake-and-bake,, smoking in the parking lot at work, etc.) but after a couple years of of heavy use I noticed some things.&nbsp; For one my emotions were closely tied to being able to smoke, and I&#039;d often find myself getting inexplicably angry if I went without for even 6-8 hours.&nbsp; I also noticed that I was absolutely addicted to the ritual of smoking and vaping, and despite quite a few attempts, I failed to quit repeatedly (weed was actually much harder for me to quit than cocaine, which I used pretty heavily for ~6 months).&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I haven&#039;t smoked in almost five months now.&nbsp; My emotions are steadier and the anger thing is much, much better.&nbsp; Also, as expected, my ability to focus has improved and I find myself procrastinating less on little things that I don&#039;t want to do (cleaning, busywork, etc.). I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t miss it though, especially at night or with music, but I could never manage to consume it in moderation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d say once daily will not affect you too much, but spending all day stoned will have some downsides, even though it can be pretty fun.

				I smoke some pretty good weed every day, taking breaks from time to time. Usually smoke btwn 2-5 bowls/day. I am early thirties married with three children, masters degree, run my own business, coach kids sports teams, attend church every week, help old ladies across the street and all kinds of other stuff. Sometimes just a small vape session can put a little spring in your step or wind down after a hectic day. The key is, just don&#039;t be a lazy dumbass and smoke everyday&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks, that sounds sensible. I was a daily user for a year or two but that was 15 years ago. I was able to manage it more or less then, hopefully I still can. Basically it can be only in the evening, I won&#039;t chance driving for 6-8 hours after smoking. I cannot at all chance being stoned at work, I will be fired if that happens. Fortunately there is no random drug testing there at all.

				Well, I myself just started to use THC again in the last months (paused like 2 years, consumed bout 10 years before). In my youth, it kinda kept me from focusing on my life, now i feel like the recreation and stress relief i get from consuming makes me focus even harder...i think my point is it totally depends on the circumstances and your state of mind.

				Interesting insight. I think to a degree it makes me more focused, but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m quite as effective. Normally my mind jumps from thing to thing quickly, like if I have 4 things to do I&#039;ll spend about 30 seconds on task #1, jump to #2, then keep going around like that until they&#039;re done. I find after weed I can sit and focus on one thing at a time, but it probably takes me longer to get everything done.

				I echo hchoman....<br />I am what you would call a &quot;very high functioning&quot; pothead and have been for going on 18+ years now with daily use.&nbsp; Sure, I take breaks now and again for a day or two but I am pretty sure I haven&#039;t had a 10 day stretch clean during that entire time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over that time period,&nbsp; I married, had kids, own my own company and dealt with everything life threw at me without much drama.<br /><br />Basically, if you take care of your shit - whatever that is - then its totally possible with weed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I heard it put this way:&nbsp; &nbsp;Weed makes smart people act average but it makes average people act stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are smart and have your shit together, you may miss a few things here and there but you definitely won&#039;t be a total fuck because you smoke weed daily.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, I find it helps me sort out what I really care about and what really doesn&#039;t matter&nbsp; (which is hard to do when you are in the middle of the situation!)<br /><br />The one side effect I have seen is this:&nbsp; After smoking a lot for a long time (weeks?&nbsp; long weekend stoned all day everyday?) I am prone to being a day or two of &quot;foggy depression&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I can usually identify when it&#039;s happening so it&#039;s totally manageable (without pharma).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d say out of a month, there may be 2-3 &quot;bad&quot; days that are a result of my weed usage.&nbsp; Normally, I am an extremely happy person when I get up in the morning but for someone who may not be as naturally happy everyday, I could see weed posing some problems with depression.<br /><br />In the end (for me anyway).....weed is by far my poison of choice.&nbsp; The goods FAR outweigh the bads and I look forward to a day when I don&#039;t have to worry about the legality. <br /><br />

				Interesting, it looks like maybe there is a whole world of us functional cannabis enthusiasts. I like cannabis because it&#039;s a totally natural product. I like to get the organic, especially the clean green certified, medical AAA+++ product on here. The stuff is just amazing. The sativa rich blends I had never never had before, the feeling from those is incredible. Though I&#039;ve noticed too much of the sativas can give me bit of panic/anxiety.

				Absolutely. Smoke weed almost every day, sometimes multiple times, sometimes not at all. I definitely notice a lack of motivation after smoking, but it certainly hasn&#039;t stopped me from having a job, going to school, girlfriend, etc. Definitely possible, I guess it depends on the person.

				that depends what you mean by &quot;normal&quot; i suppose?<br /><br />i smoke pot pretty much every day, and i still manage to do everything i need to get done for the most part. i find that smoking weed makes me much more leveled out, and less prone to mood swings... it&#039;s a good depression-helper for me, and it has been for nearly 15 years now. it also helps with my severe chronic pain. i have a medical marijuana card, so i dont buy my weed on SR as i can walk into a shop and buy it locally for much cheaper, but still, i use it almost every day in some form -- edibles, drops, flowers, extracts, concentrates, whatever. marijuana has enabled me to stay off the prescription anti-depressants i took for over a decade, that gave me side effects that were intolerable (hair loss, insomnia, anorgasmia, stomach ulcers, and &#039;being a raging fucking bitch&#039; to name just a few, from the many many brands i&#039;ve tried over the years.) and it helps me to keep my use of anxiolytics like benzos, and opiates/pain medication much lower than it&#039;s been for many years previous to having easy access to marijuana.

				Why would MMJ hold anyone back from holding friends, or a job?&nbsp; Unless you are one of those people who take it to the extreme and smoke ALL DAY EVERYDAY and have absolutely no ambition in life, then NO maybe MMJ isnt for you and you should find a different route.&nbsp; However if this is not you, then of course you can enjoy MMJ everyday and still be responsible and hold down work, friends, bills, mortgage, etc.&nbsp; I smoke everyday and the most detrimental thing it has done to me is disqualify me for some jobs i would have liked due to failure of drug tests (i am in a non-medical state)<br /><br />and every once n a while i just plain forget about something .. could be bad memory.. could be MMJ.&nbsp; &nbsp;but yes, there are FAR more &quot;functioning&quot; potheads in the world than you think.<br /><br />when i was a teen i smoked everyday, and mass amounts.&nbsp; i wish i could take that back because it hindered my education, and life ambition.&nbsp; i took it to the extreme and abused it.&nbsp; 12 years later, and after having a break of more than 4 years, i started smoking again about 10 months ago and it has been everyday, about 2-3 times a day.&nbsp; one or two bong rips per session (or the occassional dab or two) and im good for quite a few hours.&nbsp; i also notice than weed now a days seems to ground me much more than it used to.&nbsp; it slows my mind down to where i can hear myself think, process thoughts and ideas, and focus on the task at hand.&nbsp; without my MMJ im a mess, im scatter-brained, all over the place, and a total anxiety-ridden mess.&nbsp; a couple tokes fixes all of this and makes everything A OK.

				Hm, so all those commercials I saw growing up of the eggs &#039;your brain&#039; frying in the pan, they were exaggerating just a bit? At least about cannabis? Plus it being a gateway drug and all. Hhaa.

				i also know two very highly-paid computer professionals who use pot every day.. it&#039;s certainly possible to be normal and successful smoking weed. its only a gateway to the munchies... most people try tobacco and alcohol before marijuana, those would be the real &#039;gateway drugs&#039; if i believed in such a thing.

				It would be no surprise if there were many people that use pot more than a couple of times a week but still hold down a job, have stable family life etc. I count as one of these. Some mornings I will have a couple of cones before work (computers / software) and find it helps me think around hard problems as well as with the discomfort that comes with large amounts of sitting. It is probably the legality issue that keeps the majority *ahem* &quot;normal&quot; people who smoke quiet about their use. I love sativa because it gives such a mentally focused high. If you are getting anxiety try meditation or (better still) go out and get some physical exercise you lazy pot head!

				Nowadays pepple who manage to work full-time while smoking heaps seem to be in the majority. At least that&#039;s how it seems to me when I look at the people I went through university with. <br />Especially among professionals and &quot;creative&quot; types. <br />By this I mean people who smoke in the evenings the same way our grandparents might have used alcohol - as an after-dinner prelude to relaxation, as a social lubricant and as a nightcap at bed time. <br />

				I&#039;ve smoked weed every day for 17+ years and I&#039;m a highly functioning pothead and well respected member of my community. I&#039;m employed, been at my current job for 6 years, and I&#039;m very good at what I do. I&#039;ve also been high every single day at my job.<br /><br />Do I occasionally forget some things? Of course, but so do non potheads. Could I do an ever better job if I wasn&#039;t high? Probably, but being high is so much more fun ;D<br /><br />It depends more on the person than the weed, IMO
