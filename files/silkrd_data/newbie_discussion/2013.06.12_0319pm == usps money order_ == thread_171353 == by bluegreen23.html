				I&#039;m unfamiliar with the system. Has anyone ever purchased one?<br />Is ID required?<br />Do you have to list your name on them? From what I can see it doesn&#039;t have the senders name.<br /><br />What about a cashiers check? I know it requires going into the bank, but could you take cash in? do you have to have an account? do they require ID? <br /><br />anyone else have a brain storm on how to send funds internationally and securely? I feel that cash has this problem of going missing with no/limited proof. I know you can send mail with a tracking number and signature require (sending money so no one cares about fake addresses and the like) but I&#039;m looking for a secure, FAST, trackable option. Something that I can send internationally and prove it&#039;s sent.<br /><br />what happens with tormail and attachments? ie: if I attach a photo to a tormail will it be anonymous? Can you enrcypt a picture and attach it?

				I haven&#039;t bought a usps money order in years, but I don&#039;t remember being required to show ID to get it. I believe you would have to get an &#039;international&#039; money order else it wouldn&#039;t be cashable outside the US. If you can&#039;t find an answer you could always just go and buy one, and if they do ID you or you don&#039;t like it, just cash it yourself later, especially if it&#039;s not for some huge amount.<br /><br />Cashier&#039;s check I think they&#039;re going to want to see ID esp if you don&#039;t have an account. I have gotten that before, but they wanted my name and address to put on the check if I remember correctly.<br /><br />

				suppose you&#039;re right, with the give it a try approach. I think there is a limit of 1k domestic and 700 international. I have no idea what I think this, maybe I read it somewhere. <br /><br />Anyone have any recent experience before I walk into the PO?

				I don&#039;t have any recent experience, no, if it is really important to you I could give it a try in the next month or so. There&#039;s a place that takes money orders for BTC and I was thinking of giving them a try. I&#039;m not overly worried about if it&#039;s anonymous so I could try buying a money order and see what happens. But probably would be as long as a month before I would do it. Maybe usps website has some details? It&#039;s hard to say these days. Some ordinary every day things require id now that never did in the past. With information systems these days it&#039;s only a matter of time before we all have a chip embedded, probably starting with being required at birth for some stupid made up reason, and absolutely everything we do will be tracked.

				Funny thats the reason I was thinking about money order&#039;s if they don&#039;t require ID then it&#039;s a safe (no postal working will steal it) way to send money for btc. Just have to check that ID, and see how easy they are to cash outside of the US. <br /><br />Hey if you do it (even&nbsp; in a month or so) then please come back and hit me up, pm me whatever. Just let me know how it works out. <br /><br />Haha they already have chips to implant in us. Turns out not to many people are into the idea. Though more patents seem to do it for the whole &quot;kidnapping&quot; precaution.

				Ok will do. Say, I didn&#039;t see it offhand on the usps web site, but I found this other site that says &quot;At the USPS service desk a request for the money order can be made. The amount of the money order will need to be specified to the USPS representative so (s)he can print out the money order in the correct amount. If more than $3000.00 of money orders is requested, a government identification such as driver&#039;s license may be requested as per the USPS.&quot;<br /><br />Oh yah it&#039;s only a matter of time before the chip or something like it becomes mandatory. There&#039;ll be some b.s. excuse about it preventing identity theft, terrorism, kidnap, stuff like that, but in the end, it will be all about control.

				So it appears that as long as you&#039;re under 3k, no ID. Wonder how easy they are to cash especially internationally. <br /><br /><br />despite loving many things about this country, that is eventually why I will flee it. Why I also spend a large amount of time outside of it now.
