It had nothing to do with drugs at all. (Aside from that I do take that advice.)<br /><br />Good place to start is Newbie PGP Club. Once you get that down, you&#039;re on the way. This isn&#039;t an ethical thing, it&#039;s more of a *YAWN* thing. The story bored me TBO. :-\

				Sorry to hear that some people need to buy their sexual pleasures, be it with cash, food, an absurdly expensive meal or drugs.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean anything negative, and I understand that when your pressed to push out 50 posts for forum access, some strange, interesting messages can reveal themselves. I hope you can develop some cool new morphinins for us to try if you chose the username Thebaine for any personal pharmacological-related reasons.<br /><br />OH and BTW, one time this girl liked me and she stuck her hand down my pants and.. Well u said it already. but this happened like 20 different times (not the same girl) and H was never involved :P<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell out unless you&#039;re physically and mentally completely out of it, and have no control either way.<br /><br />Benzos have surpressed my sexual appetite in the past (a little... way too much at the amounts I was taking for a while). If you want self control in such situations (your reasoning is your own and I&#039; not judging. I&#039;ve been an asshole, but I vow to help others and spread positive vibes where I can to make up for pain I&#039;ve caused.)<br /><br />Thanks for the random topic and reactions.. I had to throw in my 2btc. I&#039;m almost at 50&nbsp; :D

				National Direct. Thank you for your point of view and thank you for gettting my poiint.&nbsp; the absurd 50 post rule and the fact that were forced into a general forum of newbies who mostly aren&#039;t newbies.<br /><br />Your correct.&nbsp; You caught it with my name.&nbsp; I am in search of new opiate analogues. Now that i&#039;m forced into the newbie forum where no one here really knows much about pharmacology i&#039;m forced to make stuff up to try and get to 50 posts.&nbsp; Where i want to be is posting theories and exchanging ideas in the proper area.<br /><br />I love the fact you can buy opium on here.&nbsp; It allows me to extract morphine ,codeine, thebaine and trace amounts of the other opiates.<br /><br />a little homebake with some acetic anhydride and in less than a day i got pure diacetylmorphine (heroin).&nbsp; The thebaine i save up and convert to oxycodone but truely my goal is to find the perfect opiate. <br /><br />wow you really got me to open up.

				Thebaine, have you ever tried Tapentadol HCl? It&#039;s like tramadol meets oxy, but the pain relief and euphoria is far better than tramadol. I&#039;m getting some more in this week if you want some to try I can sell you some thru my vendor account (this one) if you&#039;re interested. The price would be about $50/500mg. If you want more or less that&#039;s cool. I was just really shocked by the potency of this compound.
