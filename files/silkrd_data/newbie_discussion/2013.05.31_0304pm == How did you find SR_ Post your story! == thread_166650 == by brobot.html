				So. 2 weeks ago a chick that I hook up with XTC pills calls me and tells me she got an OZ of molly and it looks weird. She comes over and pulls it out and shows me it and says it&#039;s called Moon Rock. I look at it and tell her there is no way this is Molly, it&#039;s Meth!! She proceeded to tell me it isn&#039;t and blah blah blah. I did notice some slight differences in the look after studying it for a few minutes and partially agreed with her and what not. She told me everyone loves it and is coming back for more. She leaves me with a few G&#039;s. I than could do the real test. (she doesn&#039;t know I do speed) I put some in a glass pipe and melted it down to see what it did. Sure enough it broke down like meth but cracked back clear as day telling me it wasn&#039;t meth. Fast forward to the weekend, I go to a rave with about 40 capped pills of the moon rock. Early in the night one of my buds introduces me to this chick that wants Molly or what not. She asks if its good and i tell her it&#039;s Moonrock. She got all giddy and pulls me into the bathroom and buys 10 from me than proceeds to say, &quot;I bet you got this from the Silk Road&quot; I was like uhhhh, what&#039;s that. She says umm, it&#039;s just this website thing. She opens the door and we walk out, i grab her number and I dont see her the rest of the night. Fast forward another week and i was going through my phone and I see her name and remembered her telling me about this website. Than all of a sudden I got hit with DEJA-VU. I could of sworn I already knew what the website was but I couldnt remember thinking that I had been to it before. I proceeded to text her and I said, &quot;Hay what was the name of that website thing you told me about?&quot; She replies and says &quot;I have no idea what you are talking about&quot; I said, &quot;remember you asked&nbsp; if i have ever heard of blah blah&quot;. She continues to play dumb. Frustration settles in mixed with the DEJA-VU and i shrugged it off. So a few days passes and I get a text message from her that says, &quot;Silk Road&quot; I got excited and figured it out and here I am. Oh and a week later she replies, &quot;you are welcome&quot; I never replied to her after she told me the name lol.

				I had texted a friend asking if he knew where I could find any E.&nbsp; He said he didn&#039;t know, but I could always try the Silk Road.&nbsp; Perplexed, I did a search for Silk Road and it showed me a map of the area I live in with the nearest Silk Road to me - an actual road.&nbsp; So I texted him back and asked him &quot;So...do I just go to this road and knock on the first house I come to and ask them for MDMA?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />He then informed me that it was a website, and I felt like a complete dumbass.

				I desperately wanted to try some H with a friend but the local products here are terrible and very hard to get. So one day he said he could order some....I was interested in what he meant by that and as he explained I was blown off. That is how my SR voyage began a year ago or so :P

				Well some time ago i was into farming Bicoins, and i knew what BTC is used for. One day I entered the site because i was interested how it looks and how it works. I did not order anything, but i had Silk Road on my mind, and i told some of my frends that there is site on TOR where you can buy drugs. At that time i was not doing any drugs. After some time i tryed marijuana, and since shrooms are not so widespread where i live, i decided to give SL a try.&nbsp; 8) I had luck when i stummbled upon a guy on some IT forum that sells Bitcoins, i bougt some BTC from him, and ordered some shrooms. :)

				I heard about it when it first started. Seemed too good to be true so I forgot about it. Remembered it one day, checked it out, and was glad to find that it is real and works.
