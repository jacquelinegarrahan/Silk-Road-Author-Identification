				So I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what kind of H this is.&nbsp; So it looks light brown/tan and runs fine.&nbsp; It smells weird though when smoked.&nbsp; It was sold as black tar, but it clearly isn&#039;t.&nbsp; Just wondering.&nbsp; Thanks.

				It&#039;s probably just #4. Regular, snorting, shooting h. Obviously not black tar. Who the efffff told you that? I&#039;d smack a hoe if she told me that. H users don&#039;t play. Sorry....little rant there.

				where are you located in comparison to the atlantic ocean? east or west of it?<br /><br />if you are west then maybe you&#039;ve come across some #3 which is rarely seen on that side. it will usually run very well and have an earthy sort of taste. unless its cut with something else that is strong tasting. can you describe the taste?<br /><br />

				It may still be black tar heroin. Some people make what is called &quot;cheese&quot; heroin. They mix black tar in water then place a crushed pill into it, and finally they dry it out.

				Whatever it was, it wasn&#039;t very good quality.&nbsp; Which sucks since it is my last order ever.&nbsp; What&#039;s even worse is that I only put more money into my account because the previous vendor I purchased from suckered me into paying extra for tracking (which was never received) and I ended up being 0.005 short for another order and he wouldn&#039;t help me out (which I guess I understand but most vendors are pretty good about stuff like that or so I&#039;ve heard).&nbsp;
