				Would it be possible to develop a local distribution system that allows a grower to distribute and remain completely anonymous from their customers?<br /><br />For example, a buyer could text a phone number to place an order.&nbsp; The buyer then pays the vendor via bitcoin or some other method that allows for separation between the buyer and seller.&nbsp; The seller then stashes the goods in a location and texts the buyer the location.<br /><br />Has anyone else developed a better/fool proof system?&nbsp; It seems like the safest way to eliminate the chances of someone discovering your grow op is by minimizing the number of people who know it exists.&nbsp;

				Well I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll ever get it that anonymous, plus people like to know the people they deal with, I mean if they give your number to someone else it could be a cops number texting you and everything. You just don&#039;t know really :/ what I do for local is mailbox drops, I put the product in a bag or envelope put it in a mailbox that can be opened and then they take the product and leave cash in the mailbox, if you ever got busted, could just be like I just found some money left in a bag you know nothing about. <br /><br />As for using bitcoins as the currency, alot of people still don&#039;t know how to use it, I mean honestly depends how you were dealing it, whether it be to friends or strangers but the risk is still there, most people like the money on hand routine and I mean the chances of being caught are really slim if you know who your dealing with :) Also encrypting your sms&#039;s via apps is a good idea too if talking to friends about drug deals etc.

				What are the best apps for encryption on smart phones? &#039;Silent text&#039; charges per month ( fuck that)<br /><br />Also to answer OP, anyone with a) an interest in drugs and b) access and the know how to use BTC would most likely head strait to the source (SR) <br /><br />Plus how would you even meet to exchange numbers and decide on product and quantity.<br /><br />Use a burner (once a month pay as you go phone from wal mart) and just use your head, drugs are a face to face biz for the majority.<br /><br />Although i a very interested in other ways of reducing getting busted locally (once you have your product and SR is a non issue) you still gotta move your product!<br /><br />-JOS

				Crypthaze and CloakSMS are the main ones I think, not sure if there available for iOS but they are to android for free :) <br />Downside is the other person has to have the app and the password to decrypt the message but other then that there pretty neat.

				Smart phone anything is pretty stupid. I&#039;d keep all your business to a prepaid burner. I&#039;d even go as far as buying one off the road. Smart phones are almost as bad as those supposed rfid chips the tinhats always go on about. Buy a burner give out the number and do dead drops. Never give a name and be smart who you deal with. Whenever you aren&#039;t actively using the phone take the battery out. Never use it for anything but business and never turn it on in your home. When you want to deal with business turn it on read texts reply and take the battery out again.<br /><br />With smart phones even when you think your phone is off it isn&#039;t. It&#039;s always broadcasting and they even have systems in airports which allow them to tell exactly where you are from it. The LE&#039;s use software that lets them monitor activity around smart phones even when they aren&#039;t in a call(similar things are available publicly) I wouldn&#039;t own a smart phone to begin with. I don&#039;t see why you&#039;d want one since you have a computer. Too big of a liability and too expensive anyway.<br /><br />Never tell anyone you&#039;re growing. Especially not the people you sell to. Ideally you shouldn&#039;t tell anyone anything but you should always say that you&#039;re getting your supply from someone else. Make shit up just never admit to growing and do whatever you need to make it appear like you aren&#039;t. Even if it means holding your product in reserve or losing a few sales.<br /><br />Selling at fests is a good idea if you do it right. Don&#039;t use your real name and don&#039;t frequent the same ones too often. You should approach potential customers not the other way around. Sell to people have them bring their buddies back. If anyone walks up to you and asks if you&#039;ve got anything it&#039;s safest to say no. Even if you lose business it&#039;s the safest way. When selling at fests take orders and get it from your stash because carrying it all with you is a good way to get ripped off.<br /><br />Don&#039;t have much more advice that I can think of right now. Most of it is common sense and instinct. Remember, you can never do enough research with things like this.

				Look up dead drops for distributing locally anonymously.&nbsp; Sometimes people fill hollow stakes, shove them in the ground, and give the receiver gps coordinates, for example.<br /><br />For smartphone messaging security, look into:<br />Subscription-based - Silent Circle<br />Android to Android - TextSecure<br />Android/iOS/FF/Chrome to Android/iOS/FF/Chrome - Gliph<br />Less-user-friendly-but-better-route - XMPP (IM protocol; clients can be run on most platforms)<br /><br />But remember not to blindly trust apps.&nbsp; Often times, apps are supposed to be &#039;security-minded&#039; but do not encrypt anything.&nbsp; They just have clever ways of not saying it.&nbsp; Research.

				I feel like alot of &#039;apps&#039; out today arent very safe when compared to just selling to homies, co workers and general people you have built up a raport with. Good luck though, there is always the SR
