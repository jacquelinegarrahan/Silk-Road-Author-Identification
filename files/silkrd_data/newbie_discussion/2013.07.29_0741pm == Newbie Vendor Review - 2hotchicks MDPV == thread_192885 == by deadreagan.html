				I very much regret my lack of vendor research before my first order, though I&#039;ve learned a lot from the experience.<br /><br />Order was marked &quot;in transit&quot; on the 4th. Nothing for two weeks, deadline was three days away, so I submitted a resolution to extend the deadline by 10 days. No response for 48 hours, so I sent a very mannerly message asking if they had yet to take note of the proposal. At the last minute they accepted the resolution, saying &quot;well let&#039;s take care of this...&quot; while concurrently asking for both my address and order again.<br /><br />At this point it was very clear to me that my order had never been sent out in the first place and that they tried to take advantage of me, being an easily-targeted newbie. At last, my order was received a full 23 days after being marked &quot;in transit&quot;, but it took a whole hell of a lot of time and courteousness to get it out of them. Only reason they&#039;re getting a 2/5 is because their product is of great quality, very potent, and cheap (though their methods for keeping the price down are wholly unscrupulous). Everything else about this transaction was dreadful and nightmarish. <br /><br />To top it all off, they just blatantly lied in the Resolution Center, saying &quot;no contact with new member with no ratings&quot;.<br /><br />That&#039;s bullshit: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/OI4Z.jpg<br /><br />I have been nothing but communicative and kind to 2hotchicks and they were terribly disrespectful in return.<br /><br />tl;dr STAY FAR FAR AWAY<br /><br />*edit: changed image host
