				Placed 2 orders on the 18th. Did not expect any of them for 420 (already prepared). My order came early in the morning on the 20th. Best oil I ever had. Thank you 420potconnections. I am very pleased that one of my first orders was placed with them. <br /><br />So I tried dab technique with paper clip and found it very hard to load into bong. I did manage to do it using a lighter to heat it up but it seems there is so much waste. I was wondering if there are any other ways of smoking it. I also have a vape if there is a way with that too. <br /><br />Thanks all<br />HAPPY 420

				You should try hot knives with the oil. It&#039;s my favorite. No waste and it will last a lot longer. <br /><br />Another tip,&nbsp; put a later of ashes in the bowl first. Then, drop a drop of oil (melted from a lighter off a pin ) onto the ashes. <br /><br />Then, light and smoke.&nbsp; THe ashes hold the oil from going down the screen.&nbsp; It burns up in the ashes.&nbsp; It&#039;s like smoking crack.<br /><br />Another fun one is oil off of foil. Not the healthiest and a little ghetto .&nbsp; &nbsp; Drop oil onto foil. Hold lighter under it. Use a straw or tube to suck up the smoke.&nbsp; Use a straw with knives too so you don&#039;t burn your lips in an accident.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Happy 420!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This makes a mess of a glass pipe but:<br /><br />Drop oil Into glassware ,&nbsp; heat from under it. It will vaporize .<br />Lightbulb vaporizer pipe is good for a throw away vaporizer.<br />.

				1lb propane tank - any hardware store or walmart $5<br />pencil flame tip for soldering $10-15<br />kitchen knife - heat center of knife til red hot bend it until pointing nearly straight down<br />big safety pin - stretch out and curve the sharp pointy tip slightly<br />empty bic pen (melt the air hole closed)<br /><br />knife will easily hang off tip of torch which will keep it red hot. tank lasts 45-50 hours. <br /><br />1g oil is approx 150-200 hoots<br /><br />This will be best 20 bucks u spend, lasts years too<br /><br />
