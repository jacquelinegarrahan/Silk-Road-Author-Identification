				Inglorious Basterds.<br /><br />Col. Hans Landa: It has come to my attention you have a Negro in your employ. Is that true?<br />Emmanuelle Mimieux: Oui. He is a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He&#039;s the only other one who works with me.<br />Col. Hans Landa: Doing what?<br />Emmanuelle Mimieux: Projectionist.<br />Col. Hans Landa: Is he any good?<br />Emmanuelle Mimieux: The best.<br />Col. Hans Landa: Actually, one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors?<br />Emmanuelle Mimieux: Of course I can.<br />Col. Hans Landa: Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I&#039;m quite positive he would not want the success or failure of his illustrious evening to depend upon the prowess of a Negro. So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue – talented, no doubt, as your Negro may be – you will operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?<br />

				&nbsp;No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he&#039;ll keep comin&#039; back and back until one of you is dead.

				You wanna know how to get Capone? They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. *That&#039;s* the *Chicago* way! And that&#039;s how you get Capone

				The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we&#039;d make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it&#039;s breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.<br /><br /><br /><br />hahahhhaa
