				hi. i have been a member on SR for 3 months now with about 20-30&nbsp; transactions. for 2 months i never had any problems with deliveries. 3 weeks ago one of my orders hasn`t arrived. i blamed it on a vendor (it was a very cheap psychodelic blotter ~4gbp with postage so i assumed seller was to lazy to go to post office or sth.) after that the same thing happened to ordered dmt (i blamed it on a seller who was new to SR but now when i check his feedback, no one complained about delivery...) in the meantime some orders arrived (mostly weed and molly). 2 days ago the same thing happened to ordered lsd (~40gbp) ... i don`t know what to think IS IT NORMAL THAT ON 30 TRANSACTIONS 3 OF THEM WENT MISSING? i don`t know the usual missing orders rate... thanks in advance! i am from uk

				If you&#039;re receiving some then you&#039;re not having things confiscated in my opinion. Take it up with the vendors and if you have no luck, use the proper SR procedure. I hope you haven&#039;t finalized for things that didn&#039;t arrive

				Ordering that many small orders in that short a time then yeah I think it&#039;s normal. Don&#039;t you think some posties might ave heard of SR? Also I&#039;ve had stuff turn up after 2 months with stuff from europe before, waited longer for international stuff. <br /><br />When feedback is the most important thing for a seller do you really think they can&#039;t be bothered posting small orders? It&#039;s a pain in the arse yes but they need the feedback and also make more money on small orders. Chances of more than 1 vendor you use not bothering to post small orders is minimal.<br /><br />Keep blaming the seller and soon enough no one will sell to you.

				lol, kind of funny to think of some dude in your post office nicking your stash and getting high, sneaky bugger. Obviously not good for you though, so sorry about that.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t know what to think either in your situation. My guess is its just bad luck / coincidence. Stuff goes missing in the post all the time. Worth following up on with the vendors though if it keeps happening.
