				It has been 7 days since I wired money to MTGox and nothing yet in my acct. When should I start to worry?<br /><br />On their site it say do not call them for 7-10 day. It just seems like a long time being that it was wired.

				I think your first problem is you&#039;re still using MT Gox. That&#039;s yesterday&#039;s news bro, it&#039;s all about ~CLEARNET~localbitcoins.com~CLEARNET~ it&#039;s tor friendly, can be used anonymously, and is extremely user friendly.

				Ever since MtGox &lt;-&gt; Dwolla got axed, I&#039;ve stopped using MtGox.. Delays like yours make it too unreliable.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll see your funds in there though, their customer support has been good to me in the past.&nbsp; I would send them a message on the 9-10 day if I were you.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for buying bitcoins and anonymously moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				hey hash- i recall reading somewhere about funds being seized because the account was accessed w/Tor (MtGox) or something along those lines - so i would encourage you to do some research on the forums and over the web before you access your account through Tor-if my understanding is correct, using the clearnet is fine- its that they were using the use of Tor as proof that people were up to no good (imagine that!)&nbsp; i could be wrong, but check it out- there was a reason people moved away from MTGox

				I heard about Bitcoins a couple of years ago along with Mt Gox. Never thought I needed them until I read about Silk Road. Then it was a quest to get here! So went to Mt Gox, it took 5 days to get verified, 10 days to wire transfer to Tokyo and $40 for a international wire transfer! But, I&#039;m home now!!!!!

				i&#039;ll shed some light on why mt gox takes so long - i used to import quite a bit for our company, and we dealt with firms in western europe. Wire transfer funds, under international agreement, banks on both sides of the transaction have 7 days time, each, to complete the transaction. I&#039;m sure those terms were worked out by lobbyists for the bank industry, but i suspect the reason is it gives banks on each side of the transaction a)some time to &quot;sleep with your money&quot; interest free, and they make money on the &quot;float&quot; as it&#039;s called, and b) i suspect they use that 7 day time window (on the sender&#039;s side) to play the exchange rate market where they&#039;ll try to make some more shekels off your money. Bank on the receiving end only gets the free use of the money for 7 days before they have to disburse it to the receiver&#039;s acct.<br /><br />i&#039;m not justifying it, just splaining it - and to be frank, localbitcoins.com is where i&#039;d go - check all the threads on the subject<br /><br />Newguy321&nbsp; -&nbsp; i am curious, what fees did mt gox charge for the bitcoins, above the exchange rate?

				<br />tbart<br /><br />I am still waiting on my money! It has been over three weeks now. One would think that a bank would want your money to be transferred into it as fast as possible. I could see long wait times for folks withdrawing money but for putting money in?<br /><br />I have not seen any fees yet but I am sure I will. My bank charged me 45 dollars for the international transfer. I am thinking of calling my bank and seeing if I can cancel the wire.<br /><br />I had a successful transaction with virwox but it was costly. I am checking into localbitcoins for my next purchase. Moneypak is gone now and I am not sure about okpay.<br /><br />I am going to try to find someone I can deposit money into their acct. I just live in the boondocks and there are no big chain banks nearby.

				@Newguy, I had to finally contact Mt Gox and they took care of it within 6 hours. In their mission statement, it goes something like, if there is a problem, they can&#039;t do anything until you contact them (customer support).&nbsp; Your almost there buddy!

				@Chicagodogs,<br /><br />So glad you got taken care of! I just had my 3rd chat session with them. The gave me the same ole line. I told them I will cancel the transfer if its not in my acct by Monday evening.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas about what days and hours they work?

				3 weeks is well beyond the norm - and i hadn&#039;t factored in the cost of the int&#039;l wire transfer<br /><br />next time try localbitcoins.com - total cost is what you see the seller asking for the bitcoins - i met my seller in a F2F at a mcdonalds so i could see the coins transfer into my wallet, and he stuck around until 2 confirmations had shown up.<br /><br />next time, i&#039;m going to try the bank deposit route on localbitcoins - totally anonymous transaction, and coins are escrowed once you clik on the &quot;buy&quot; button - then when you&#039;ve made the deposit, you tell the seller - sellers are paying a 1% escrow fee out of their price, so if the exchange rate seems high, factor that in - in my F2F, seller&#039;s rate was 5% over mt gox&#039;s rate at the time, but the transaction was instantaneous and anonymous<br /><br />good luck with getting things straightened out with mt gox<br /><br />fwiw
