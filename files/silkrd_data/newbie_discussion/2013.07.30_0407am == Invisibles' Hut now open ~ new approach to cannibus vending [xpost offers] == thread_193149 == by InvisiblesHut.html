To learn specifics, please visit my listing for a Ticket to Invisibles&#039; Denver Dispensary Tour below<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a7995fe601<br /><br />The gist of Invisibles&#039; Tour works like this;<br />visit http://weedmaps.com - select &quot;Denver - Central&quot; - pick up to an oz of any strain you would like. Purchase a ticket with your specific order, then Invisible retrieves it and shares a stealth listing for your custom order.<br /><br />feedback appreciated, cheers

				This just seems overly complicated. Why not just make a conventional listing?<br /><br />Also, it seems like you may be putting the dispensaries at risk of LEO danger.

				Because there are plenty of other conventional listings out there.&nbsp; I am not a grow-house myself, and unless I&#039;m large scale there&#039;s no way to compete with other SR vendors, so compete by being unique.&nbsp; Also, you can get any strain you want?&nbsp; <br /><br />Dispensaries are in no way of LEO danger anymore-so than a buyer is in danger for putting their name and address on an order.&nbsp;

				what JP said<br />plus i couldn&#039;t find &quot;DENVER _ CENTRAL&quot; - i must be stupid or blind<br /><br />and, i quote &quot;Dispensaries are in no way of LEO danger anymore-so than a buyer is in danger for putting their name and address on an order. &quot;<br /><br />don&#039;t mean to hurt your feelings here, but shipping outside of colorado wouldn&#039;t be illegal?<br /><br />sorry bud, but i have concerns with your assessment and your security

				&gt; https://legalmarijuanadispensary.com/dispensaries/in/colorado/denver-central <br /><br />shipping outside of colorado is clearly illegal, as is shipping of any drug on SR; we all know stealth.&nbsp; However, this has nothing to do with the dispensaries, nothing is being shipped from a dispensary and nothing is shipped with dispensary info on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />@JP thanks, though I&#039;m comfortable with people knowing I live in Denver

				I like the idea but have a couple concerns/questions. Your pricing structure seems hard to understand. *Invisible&#039;s Pricing Structure is as follows:<br /><br />$PRICE + $REAL COST + 1 BTC job fee. I get the price/ real cost thing but the $100 job fee must be a mistake. Also, see if there is a way to not look at the map on the clearnet. I really don&#039;t care to open tor and another browser at the same time.&nbsp;
