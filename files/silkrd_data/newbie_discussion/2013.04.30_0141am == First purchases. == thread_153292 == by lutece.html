				I am sure a lot of us here in the Newbie section haven&#039;t been able to make our first buy yet. What is going to be your first purchase once we&#039;re back on? I&#039;ve got my eye on some edibles.

				like junk, your first buy, opening your mailbox and knowing your anticipation is over, will be addiction in the greatest form. prepare to blow stacks. <br /><br />My first purchase was a fake ID, bought mainly frauds and then decided to try getting drugs. Then... it all began.

				I had my first purchase sent overnight so it arrived with signature required. I wasn&#039;t home to receive it. It was rather nerve racking going to the post office to sign for it. Worked out tho.

				I had to quit smoking weed a year ago because my employer started with random drug tests. I haven&#039;t had any other drugs since the mid-90&#039;s so I just didn&#039;t have any connections, and resigned myself to a life on the straight side.<br /><br />After doing some research I found that my old favorites LSD and MDMA leaves the body much faster than weed, and generic drug tests don&#039;t scan for them anyway. I registered on SR a few days ago and spent some tine figuring out BTC and as soon as the site is up I&#039;ll be ordering some.

				My first purchase was MDMA. Though I&#039;m looking forward to researching some edibles when SR is finally back up and running. DPR&#039;s thread says it could be a few more days &gt;:(.
