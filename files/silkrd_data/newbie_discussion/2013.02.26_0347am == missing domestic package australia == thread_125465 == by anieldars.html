				hey so this is my first post and all good morning everyone :) <br />anyways basically im in a bit of a pickle, so i ordered a few tabs off a relatively new vendor who was quite helpful through out the whole process but its been at least a week and a half now and ive not seen anyhting. the package came with tracking which im a bit worried to check in case the package is flagged but the vendor assured me he checked tracking and callled the post office and they confirmed it had arrived. i have not seen the package yet and this is the first time ive had a domestic package go missing. im a bit skeptical about the packaging because apparently when i had requested to add to the order he told me &quot;&quot;Yep, I sent it today and your post code says it will be there tomorrow.<br /><br />And yea I will make it up to you on your next order, I would have done on this order but I couldn&#039;t open the bag lol you will see my attempts when you get the package :)&quot;&quot;<br /><br />could the package have been intercepted because of a dodgy looking package? and if so, the vendor offered a re ship, would it be too risky to have anymore orders to this adress ?<br /><br />thank you<br />appreciate any help :)&nbsp;

				First thing to check is the address -- did you use your real address? with your real name? Also, when you say tabs do you mean LSD or are you talking short for tablets, as in medication? What exactly was in the package?<br /><br />Was it sent via express or regular postage?<br /><br />Check the tracking via your tor browser of choice, they can&#039;t track you then. If he has checked it, for all they know it&#039;s him checking it.<br /><br />If it has in fact been intercepted, I am under the impression (having never had it happen to me or known anyone that it&#039;s happened to) that the AFP/local law enforcement will have either sent you a letter by now, or would have made contact. Obviously if this is the case, it was only a personal amount right? You will be fine, a slap on the wrist and drug diversion if they decide to actually pursue it.

				True well the order was 20 blotters of 25i that was shipped express. the address is not my personal residence and the name is fake which has been my method since the start.<br />i checked the tracking and it said delivered tho ive not heard anything. the problem is i finalized early because i heard news of receiving a different package which was mistaken for this one.<br />if it was intercepted in your opinion would that be the last time you would use the same address ? <br />also you may not know but do you have any idea what would be the chance of LE searching my house if the person receiving the package tried to mention my name ? <br />thanks a lot btw this has been a great help ! :)

				You&#039;ve received plenty of packages there in the past? I think it might be time to change your receiving address, I know I wouldn&#039;t be getting orders sent there anymore. Can you really trust the people it&#039;s being sent to? As in, what at the chances of them keeping this one? If it&#039;s been marked as delivered, then there are a couple of different options:<br />A. there was a mistake, and it&#039;s either still on its way or it&#039;s been lost in transit.<br />B. the mailman, for one reason or another decided to keep this one and trip ballz.<br />C. the people who have been receiving your orders accidentally opened it, and decided to keep it.<br />D. the people who have been receiving it knew that there was an order coming, and decided to keep it.<br /><br />Either way, I would be changing my receiving address if I were you :) As for them searching your house, I wouldn&#039;t want to say that it could never happen and then it does -- but I would have to say the likelihood is very unlikely. Unless you&#039;ve received &quot;dealable&quot; quantities before and often, then I can&#039;t see why they would go after a consumer, as opposed to going after a seller/maker.<br /><br />Best of luck!
