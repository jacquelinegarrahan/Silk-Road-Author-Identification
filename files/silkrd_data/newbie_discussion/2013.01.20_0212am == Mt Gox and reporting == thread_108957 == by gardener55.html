				Hi All, I am new to the forum, though for a couple of weeks I have been reading all I can about,gpg&#039;s, pgp&#039;s (almost overwhelming),Bitcoins, SR, and lots on WIKI, and the Forum,there is so much to learn! Not complaining at all, very happy to discover this site and appreciate the fact there is an answer for chronic pain where I am not constrained by those who would have me convince them of it. I came across a thread about Mt. Gox, it stated that they were good to use for Bitcoins, but unfortunately any business coming from TOR had to be reported. Now this concerns me a bit. Can anyone tell me WHO they report to and in what capacity? I am ready to buy Bitcoins, but because of what I read I am shying away from them and checking out Coinbase. I want to stay safe. Any input would be appreciated. Thank-you

I am a cpm patient too so I know your pain very well.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I have a good doctor but the feds so closely reg pm Dr.s these days. Doesn&#039;t seem to matter how many CT, MRI and surgery you have they make it very hard. I don&#039;t even want to get started on pharmacist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I looked into Mtgox too. You can&#039;t access through tor because they might freeze your accounts. You also have to link to a bank account ( which I don&#039;t like) and because of the patriot act the have to collect information about you. <br /><br />They are a leget exchange and the cheapest option but you loose some privacy. <br /><br />I found bitinstant which has a small fee but is anonymous and fast and lets you buy coin with cash. <br /><br />Hope this helps you. I am going to buy some coins with this method tomorrow and will post my experience. <br /><br />I hope you feel better.&nbsp;

				You dont have to connect a bank account with mtgox you can also use bitinstant to route money to mtgox then move the money from there to an online wallet then to SR i have done so. I think mtgox knoes what their exchange are being used for but just want to look legit in the public eye, therefore would rather you not access thru TOR. I believe they were also compromised once before when allowing to use Tor and would rather be safer than sorry.

				I am a BRAND new user.&nbsp; First order was less than a week ago.&nbsp; I did a *TON* of reading before moving.&nbsp; I went with MtGox.&nbsp; ... but I&#039;m new so maybe it was dumb but it worked just fine and it was cheap.

				mtgox will freeze your accounts if you create multiple accounts with the same ip address OR if you create accounts using tor ip addresses, huge fucking hassle.&nbsp; They keep careful track of which ip addresses you&#039;re using to access certain accounts.&nbsp; I&#039;m using coinapult or blueskytraders from now on.

				I have used MtGox twice through Bitinstant and had a fast exchange, under 5 minutes.&nbsp; How could MtGox know your transferring Bitcoins into an SR account?&nbsp; I doubt the can know, so it seems safe.

				Opioid, thanks for that. I&#039;ve heard some users say that they had problems transferring into the SR wallet or that it&#039;s too risky. I wasn&#039;t sure what to believe.

				As has been mentioned before, MtGox apparently don&#039;t like their service being used for SR. I have however used MtGox on 2 occasions to deposit money directly into my SR wallet.<br /><br />It depends on where you live, as to how many services are available to you. I know that in Australia you can use SpendBitCoins which for me, is now the easiest and quickest option :)

				I&#039;ve never used bitcoins before, and it does seem relatively easy. I just don&#039;t want any problems arising as I used the Mtgox route.
