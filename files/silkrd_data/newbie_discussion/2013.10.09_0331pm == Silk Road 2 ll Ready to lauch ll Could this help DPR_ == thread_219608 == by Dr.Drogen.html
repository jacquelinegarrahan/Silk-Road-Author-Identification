				Hey Members <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading all over the web that Silk Road 2 Is ready to launch tomorrow. There just at there final testing stage. Some vendors will get a anonymous Invite before it launches. If you do not believe me please google it or something! Could this help DPR in court? Like i mean if he said &quot; It was not me. If it was how is it up again &quot; Or sum thing i don&#039;t know! I really do hope that this is not a Hox. But hopefully well all move over to SR 2 and we will all be reunited together :). If anyone knows anything about SR 2 please reply :) <br /><br /><br />Much Love To All: Dr&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As exciting as it sounds, I&#039;d urge caution as this could be (a) a hasty attempt to replace SR v1 and full of risk; (b) a scam; (c) LE sting op; or (d) A fucking HUGE success!<br /><br />Seriuosly use caution. LOTS!

				Bro, you straight up sound like LE trying to play off a dumb stoner. I&#039;m fairly new to this forum as far as membership, but damn. Are you really THAT naive to think that after this significant of an event that something that was up for 2 YEARS with thousands of transactions would come back up in a week? Fuck no. Use BMR or go use some fake ass &quot;Silk Road&quot; and give someone .1btc for shit and giggles.&nbsp;

				The best thing that the new SR site could do, is claim to be &#039;the&#039; DPR.&nbsp; Nobody has made this claim yet, founded or unfounded....but clearly, somebody claiming to be the one and that Ross was just a small time bystander would help his cause big time.

				Who knows man. Someone throws out a fake .onion address and people go nuts. Did you see the &quot;new&quot; SR address that was released the other day? It&#039;s fake as fuck and you can tell because the images are all pixly. If there&#039;s anything I can remember about DPR in my short time being a customer on SR it was &quot;Read the forums&quot; or &quot;Read the Wiki&quot;. Determining what&#039;s bullshit is mostly easy, but tread carefully as far as what people tell you man..
