				Well, can&#039;t post in the shipping section yet, so;<br /><br />How long would you say a vacuum sealed bag holds the smell of marijuana in for? I&#039;ve heard it starts to leak after a few days, especially if there is heat involved. What&#039;s the longest anyone has had a pack of bud in transit for (actually dropped off, not just marked in transit) and still received? How many layers was it, if you remember?

				Nice, thanks for the thorough response.<br /><br />Anyone else? Only shipments of weed I had were domestic and took 3 days at the most. All were double sealed and only one started to smell after I removed the first one, and that was hash.

				Food grade vacuum sealing begins leaking microscopic amounts within 15 seconds. So triple seal minimum if all you&#039;re using is food grade. The shipping forum recommends higher grade packaging (I forget the name, evidently it&#039;s similar to mylar). <br /><br />Also, the harder a vacuum you pull, the more it stress on the packaging, increasing the porosity.

				It will depend on the quality of the plastic being used to seal, how many layers used,&nbsp; how hard the vacuum is pulled, and how long it&#039;s been in there, and how much is in there.<br /><br />Plastic will always have microscopic pores which allow for scents to pour out.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t forget that dog noses are like, millions of times more sensitive than yours. So if you&#039;re able to smell it by the 3rd layer (or whatever), you can bet a dog could have picked it up a few layers before that.

				I think there are some masking substances for dog-noses connected with 2-3 layers of vacuum there&#039;s no way that dog-nose will feel it.<br />Anyway, for overseas shipment it can be opened even if there&#039;s no smell.

				Careful asking about and divulging shipping methods on these forums... But at any rate, shipping bud domestically within the US, one is usually sufficient with containing the smell from being detected by humans alone, and getting the package to its destination ASAP. LDPE (Polyethylene), like the foodsaver bags, has a higher rate of permeation than HDPP (Polypropylene) by a substantial rate. However, if one gets a package to the point of canine inspection imo you&#039;ve fucked up already as that is unlikely to be conducted at random unless you&#039;re shipping internationally. Bud should always be vaccuum sealed at least three layers when using the commercially available LDPE vac bags, although if it gets where it needs to be quick and isn&#039;t a large quantity, such as multiple pounds, a double layer will often suffice depending on certain conditions like type of bud, smell, other packaging, and time of year. Heat volatizes the terpenes in cannabis producing a more pronounced smell. So shipping to hot areas, or during the summer is riskier with smellier items than the winter, maybe. 3M makes moisture vapor barrier bags that are used for electronic circuit boards and electronics that are multiple, impermeable metal layers that can be heat sealed and are opaque. These are the best bags imo for shipping anything a canine can detect, as they are relatively cheap and can likely stand up to canine searches if the outside is properly cleaned with alcohol or acetone, and the packaging not cross-contaminated. But in summary go with at least 6mil LDPE (foodsavers are 2mil thick, each layer), at least 4mil thick HDPP, however many layers depending on bag thickness. MBBs can be used alone even with bud, but might as well do a double or triple LDPE seal, clean it, then use a MBB that is impermeable and also opaque. Vaccuum sealing doesn&#039;t change anything but the pressure differential, and altering the shape of the material and its crystallinity by tight vaccuuming, will be detrimental to avoiding slower permeation rates.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
