				Alle,<br /><br />Does anyone use Dwolla and MtGox to get their funds to SR? Is it safe? It looks like its pretty cost efficient. I&#039;d appreciate anyone&#039;s thoughts.<br />

				This is a common way to get coins, but I&#039;d advise against it. When I joined this place I spent months reading stickies and many posts.<br /><br />The reason why this is not good for SR users is because you are using Dwolla. To use Dwolla you are transferring funds from a bank account! This will compromise your anonymity. If someone really wanted to they could trace the bitcoin purchase all the way to your bank account. Bitcoins are not automatically anonymous. <br /><br />From recent reading on the security form people have been having really good luck with this scheme, I have not used it myself yet.<br /><br />Obtain Cash----&gt;Do a cash deposit to Bitfloor (using a wallet that is not your SR wallet)------&gt;When coins are in wallet send them through a coin tumbler (bitcoinfog or blockchain info mixer) to another wallet (this help to anonyomize your coins)------send to SR wallet.<br /><br />It might help to send the coins through a few more coin tumblers. <br /><br />Here is the block chain info mixer address:&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/wallet/send-shared

				What is the downside to buying bitcoins by whatever method (bank transfer) and then laundering them through Bitfog on their way to SR? Particularly for a retail customer (as opposed to a major dealer) it would seem like that would anonymize the coins in your SR wallet. It&#039;&#039;s not against the law to buy bitcoins, and no one can make you say where the ones you bought went. If they can&#039;t connect the bitcoins that were used on SR with you, then where&#039;s the danger? Just asking - anyone have input?

				If you&#039;re just buying small personal amounts, then don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;s going to take you getting prosecuted and some heavy charges for distribution etc for them to waste their time tracing bitcoins. If you&#039;re buy large amounts, then no, I wouldn&#039;t touch Dwolla or anything that requires personal verification.

				I wanted to make a quick statement to the people who&#039;s replies followed mine. For all of those people who say &quot;the quantities are too small, its fine,&quot; or LE won&#039;t go through the trouble of decoding the blockchain, you people are lying to yourselves to justify your laziness. That was pretty harsh but that is the truth.<br /><br />Only very stupid people think the police are stupid.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that LE is very very interested in SR and BTC. The last article I read about the Australian police finding a guy&#039;s package in the post and making the bust had commentary from the American FBI stating that it was a high priority target. Like I said earlier BTC is not automatically anonymous, the block chain contains the info. If the blockchain were ever decoded it would reveal a purchase history from Dwolla all the way to SR, if SR was compromised.<br /><br />to bogdanlis Here are some other options: (I&#039;ve only done the cash deposits to bitinstant, judging from what people are saying about bitinstant its sounds a bit sketch, like some people don&#039;t get their money.)<br /><br />Take the hit and buy from sugarmama he/she sells BTC. He/She is expensive for anything over $100 USD.<br /><br />Make a cash deposit at Wells Fargo to Bitcopia then to your wallet then through a tumbler/mixer then to SR wallet.<br /><br />We were using cash deposits at any CVS, 7/11, Walmart, Moneygram to Bitinstant but bitinstant has be fucking up recently.<br /><br />I learned a lot from reading sleepyeyes2k2&#039;s posts this guy claims he was former LEO. He definable has the knowledge so even if he wasn&#039;t this dude knows a lot. <br /><br />Here is a link to an interesting thread. Hes post num 55. Has a lot of good advice about protecting yourself.&nbsp; <br />
