				Maybe it&#039;s just my tin foil hat, but I wonder if there&#039;s any link between the whole bitinstant fiasco over the past few weeks and coming back without coinapult/btc address (the most super anonymous methods) and blockchain.info removing the anonymous payments/receipts and ziggap removing chase deposits (seems like it&#039;s BoA 99% of the time)

				Zipzap/cashpayment.com is fine, only way I ever use to get coin because it&#039;s sooo much faster. I&#039;ve sent tens of thousands of dollars through bitinstant over time and while they&#039;ve definitely screwed up once or twice, they&#039;ve made it right in the end every time. Coinbase.com bank transfer is the cheapest and easiest way to get coin, but it takes FOREVER (5-7 days, ain&#039;t nobody got time fo that), so I deal with the more expensive but faster option (bitinstant is 4% + 3.95 and coinbase is 1% + a few cents in bank fees depending on which bank you have). But don&#039;t take my word for any of this, try out bitinstant with the minimum USD amount ($20 I think), to test the water. Or don&#039;t, I don&#039;t give a shit.

				Although Bitinstant is back up, it seems as though their moneygram to bitcoin email address is down.<br />They have the following message posted on their site:<br />&nbsp;&quot;The Bitcoin address and Bitcoin-to-email options are temporarily offline for system updates. These options should be back up on Monday, March 11. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience while we run these upgrades.&quot;<br />How does one send bitcoin funds from MtGox to Silk Road account.<br />as a sidenote btc-e option is also down. Any reply would be awesome if anyone has any insight.

				For those of you unable to submit bitcoins because Bitinstant is down, check out Bitfloor.<br /><br />I had been trying to use Bitinstant for a couple of months but it was always down in 3-5 day sessions every time I was going to place my order.&nbsp; I got frustrated and said &quot;fuck them&quot;.&nbsp; Someone recommended Bitfloor and I had a great experience.&nbsp; You simply sign up (e-mail required), type in the dollar amount you want to transfer, and they will give you an account number (which can only be used at Bank of America) and some information.&nbsp; From here, you just tell the teller you are trying to pay an out of state bill.&nbsp; Be sure to pay the exact amount (for instance, if you order $500 worth, your price to deposit will be $501.xx)&nbsp; Hand them the cash and fill out the form with the information you got from Bitfloor.&nbsp; The money will literally be in your account 10 minutes later.&nbsp; Then all you need to do is buy bitcoins.&nbsp; There&#039;s two options, but I went for the immediate marketplace option. <br /><br />Of course, I send them through 3 Blockchain wallets before sending to Silk Road (which caused me to lose some money).&nbsp; <br /><br />After it was all said and done, $631 and some change to BoA yielded me around $575.&nbsp; The entire process took about 2-3 hours (most of the time was spent waiting for my Blockchain transfers to confirm).<br /><br />I highly recommend it.&nbsp; The exchange rates are a bit high but there wasn&#039;t any hassle.
