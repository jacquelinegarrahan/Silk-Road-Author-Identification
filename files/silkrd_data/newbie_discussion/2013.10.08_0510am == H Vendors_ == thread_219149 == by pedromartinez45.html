				Has anyone heard from any of the major SR H vendors.&nbsp; dragoncove, supremesmoke, subsrgood, gotsitall, 10toes, crystalship, deezletime, DieselTherapy, purest, etc?&nbsp; I have been trying to find them and have not been having any success, and obviously with H time is of the essence.&nbsp; There is an account on BMR posing as dragoncove but I am pretty sure it is a scammer, as I ordered from them and was asked to FE and release escrow before it would be shipped, and it has a different pgp key than used at SR.&nbsp; Purest has not logged on to either BMR or Sheeps marketplace in 3-4 days, which is causing me some concern.&nbsp; Subsrgood is not responding to emails, I am wondering if a lot of H vendors got taken down or what.&nbsp; Seems a little strange to me....

				Subs is fine is all i will say about that..<br /><br />The dragoncove account on BMR was there for a while, he had an account both places..<br /><br />As for the rest I DUNNO.. The Company is over at sheep&#039;s, they have bad ass deals going on. Their not under the company any more though..<br /><br />They sell BTH &amp; SUPPOSEDLY CHYNA WHITE BUT THE CHYNA IS ONLY 160 A G.. bUT THEY had good stats here and i only heard of 1 complaint against them..<br /><br />If u want their vendor name over their PM me, or PM them.. Again subs is not in jail.. Hes just being smart.. Now dragoncove im afraid the worst for him cause they went after akkit if ny vendors, DC was not just making his money on SR, nOT SAYING HE WAS DOING ANYTHING ELSE ILLLEGAL at all.. But i just fear the worst for him,, Hatter also. We all know NOD got popped .. <br /><br />pUREST IS on Sheeps i think, im pretty sure i saw his stuff<br /><br /><br />also bth vendor alderwright has moved to sheeps, hes stuff is good<br /><br />Thats all i can remember to update u on
