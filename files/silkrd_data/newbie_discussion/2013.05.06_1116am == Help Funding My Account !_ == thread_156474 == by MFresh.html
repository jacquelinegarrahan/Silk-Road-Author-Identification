				that seems like alot of money for a first order, I wouldnt spend so much on the first order but thats just me. It depends on what country you live in as to what bitcoin service would be best.

But it&#039;s really not a big hassle, aside from that.<br /><br />I put in an order with bitinsstant Saturday morning. Drove 16 miles to Walmart&#039;s moneygram center and my coins were in my wallet by the time I got home.<br /><br />No ID, no questions. Just fill out the blue Moneygram form, and deposite the money exactly as they told you. <br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s no more difficult than doing a bank deposit for coins, and that&#039;s about as easy as it gets while trying to maintain an acceptable degree of anonymity. <br /><br /><br />BTW: I&#039;ve noticed the moneygram tellers raise an eyebrow every time&nbsp; the go to total your transfer fees. But don&#039;t worry. That&#039;s because there are none, and most tellers have never seen a money transfer with zero charges. <br />I just say; &quot;pretty cool, huh?&quot; and they treat you like a VIP on your way out.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				are you buying BTC or trying to send US dollar straight to SR?If your buying BTC you transfer it into a bitcoin wallet 1st and then from there into the SR account.<br />I suppose you could transfer straight into the SR account but thats how I do it.<br />Im not sure you can just transfer cash into SR cos thats traceable.hope this helps.

				I would recommend bitinstant, I&#039;m not sure why you are wary of them. They have good support staff and are generally very quick. Dont have to worry about your information or anything.<br /><br />And you can either deposit directly to your SR bitcoin deposit address (that long string of letters and numbers), or make an account with an online wallet service like blockchain.info and deposit it to the bitcoin address it gives you there and then from there send them to your SR deposit address. I would recommend skipping that and sending directly from bitinstant to SR deposit address.

				I do Dwolla -&gt; Campbx. Only costs $.25. Granted you have to wait 3 days generally for the money to clear your bank and deposit to Dwolla but Campbx picks it up almost immediately. They have a $1000 trade limit unless you get verified.
