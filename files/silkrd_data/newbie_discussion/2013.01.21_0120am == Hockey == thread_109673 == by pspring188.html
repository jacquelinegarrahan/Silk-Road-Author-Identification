It&#039;s sort of like lacrosse with a ball on the floor rather than in the air.

				Hockey = Love<br /><br />First of all, I would like to say that hockey players in general are hot.&nbsp; Not all of them.&nbsp; And I am an anti-essentialist, of course, I do not believe in types of people.&nbsp; But many of them look so hot the way they throw off their helmets as they skate off the ice.&nbsp; It reminds me of when I was a kid at the community pool, and there were these boys from another school there, and they had this funny way of shaking the water off their heads when they broke the surface.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how they did it exactly, but it was cute.&nbsp; I was in love.&nbsp; I tried doing it myself, but as I (a) am a girl, and (b) had long hair at the time (pulled back in the obligatory ponytail for swimming), it never looked as cool.<br /><br />Right, so, hockey.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; The skating thing too is somehow both graceful and defiant.&nbsp; &nbsp;
