				I&#039;m highly intersted in trying out medical grade edibles. But I have my personal rule of not ordering any products that can be detected by sniffer dogs. <br />Since these products are made out of hash oils do they still give away the odors dogs are trained to detect ?

				yes im pretty sure they do, but thats not to say you shouldnt order some. I too dont like to order things like marijuana products that are likely to be detected by sniffer dogs, but if you do your home work, find the right vendor it is highly unlikely that anything will go wrong. <br /><br />EDIT: just about anything can be detected by drug dogs FYI

				Yes, the weed will still be detectable.&nbsp; But the handler will believe the dog is interested in the food.&nbsp; Drug dogs are still dogs, not a machine.&nbsp; Dogs also DO miss drugs, cops don&#039;t want you to believe this, but they are not 100% accurate. There are many examples of a dog false indicating.<br /><br />The problem is that a dog associates drugs with their toy and if they don&#039;t find their toy they will still try the behavior that gets them their toy IE indicating.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the dog&#039;s mind its the question &quot;will you still praise me?, I would like that&quot;.&nbsp; In addition cops often encourage this sort of thing with commands like &quot;come on&quot; &quot;get it boy&quot;.&nbsp; While these phrases are said during training the officer will make the toy appear.&nbsp; So basically the dog is hearing what it thinks means my toy is coming.<br /><br />But if the cop sees food he will probably ignore it as long as the vendor does not have it in the wrapper that labels it as what it is. <br /><br />So&nbsp; in my opinion you have&nbsp; a good chance of getting your goods. Plus I would think any vendor for Chews will be in the USA.&nbsp; If you are also in the USA this means a whole different (and safer for you) shipping protocol.&nbsp; The thing you need to worry about is international shipping, that is usually where they have the dogs. <br />
