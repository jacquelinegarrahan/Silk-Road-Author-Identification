				Has anyone here considered stockpiling drugs? I have so much fun with the quality MDMA on SR, I am considering buying bulk and storing just for those closest to me. <br /><br />Any thoughts? I don&#039;t what to come off as not having faith in SR, but seriously, drugs are fun and I want to be able to do them for as long as possible.

				Sure, just be sure to look up how to properly store each chemical.<br /><br />Keep in mind stockpiling is a good idea if you are a user not a dealer.<br /><br />If you were to get busted with a stockpile, those individual charges rack up fast.

				Just don&#039;t go overboard is my advice, getting caught with a couple of ounces of MDMA would not be fun.

				If you have set yourself up to be completely anonymous. Have a secure drop &amp; don&#039;t mind potentially loosing said drop. I do not see the harm. I would stake your drop before retreiving it the day your bulk arrives. <br />What is bulk to you?<br />A kg or an ounce, 10g&#039;s<br />I personally stock pile for those rainy days ahead...inevitable. But I beleive my key to success is ordering small packages, no more than 10 g&#039;s. I get more variety &amp; there&#039;s less chance of a seizure. But hey it&#039;s up to you....I wouldn&#039;t like to be busted with an ounce of any class 1 substance.<br />One tends to bury said drugs to avoid racking up multiple felonies imo. &amp; analyze your situation to the endth degree!<br />Peace &amp; Good luck with what ever you do.

				Hey guys thanks for the tips --- any stockpiling is still probably a year away from being seriously considered, but I guarantee it will be planned to a elaborate degree.

				A pretty safe idea as long as you don&#039;t go too overboard with it. 10g of molly at a time should do you fine. Just don&#039;t be tempted to start selling to strangers, because the temptation will be there.
