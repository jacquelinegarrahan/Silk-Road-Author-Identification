				a new vendor girtbysea is on the scene<br />selling alex grey blotters, 2cb and mephedrone<br />mentioning dodgy vendors<br />could it be that EnterTheMatrix has returned from Thailand to open up shop again<br /><br />not wanting to hurt girtbysea if there is no connection and we will probably never know for sure<br />just seems a bit odd that ETM had all of those items stocked on a regular basis prior to the massive increase in stock holding and eventually running away with thousands of extra bitcoins

				Hi, girtbysea here.<br /><br />I would definitely not want to be associated with that scammer. There&#039;s not much I can say to convince people I guess.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll do so by my actions: I&#039;m honest. I deal with integrity. And I let excellent products and service do the talking.<br /><br />From what I recall, ETM made &quot;extravagant claims&quot; (lies) about his product, charged through the nose, and then fucked off with everyone&#039;s money.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to do the opposite of all that, and make it a fair deal for all.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />gbs<br /><br />PS: I wasn&#039;t aware ETM sold the same blotter (I don&#039;t recall seeing photos of it), but it&#039;s a very common print going around Australia since before Christmas. And I can guarantee you ETM wasn&#039;t laying it himself.

				Hi girtbysea, I believe you are absolutely right, ETM, despite the shit he talked, definitely wasn&#039;t laying his own tabs. I picked up some IRL that were very similar to the stuff he sold on SR, for a lot less $$.<br /><br />People need to stop accusing everyone of being ETM when the only evidence you have is they sell similar prod. It&#039;s a little hysterical. ETM may be here, but realistically we&#039;ll never know until his new incarnation does a runner and leaves us a lol finger.<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142964.msg979151#msg979151">Quote from: look @ my nuts on April 05, 2013, 12:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">just look at my testes man they speak for themselves<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have no idea what this means...

				Just ordered 5 LSD tabs from girt by sea. My last LSD purchase was from ETM, a month or so before he fucked off. ETM&#039;s tabs were complete duds, not even sure if they were acid, me and 4 friends had 1 each and felt sober the whole time. I received girtbysea&#039;s tabs on friday, and they were exactly the same blotter, Alex Gray blotters with a single sided print, cardboard on the back. I had two of these last night, and my other mate also had two. After waiting 2 hours and feeling nothing, he took the last tab, and still felt nothing. I&#039;m not sure if it is ETM, but they definitely have the exact same dud product and it was very disappointing to have another failed acid trip. I&#039;ve had countless &quot;150ug&quot; tabs, and these ones are definitely nowhere near that dose, I&#039;d say maybe a quarter of that amount of acid, or not even. I haven&#039;t had a chance to talk to girtbysea because of SilkRoad being down at the moment, but i&#039;ll update with what happens.
