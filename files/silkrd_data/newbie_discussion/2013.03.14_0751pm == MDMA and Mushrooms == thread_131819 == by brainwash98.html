				When I&#039;m on shrooms (Psilocybin cubenis) Time lags &amp; The high seems to last forever.<br />When I take MDMA time &amp; the high flys by much too quickly. <br />If I combine the 2 will the time lagging effect of the shrooms slow down the MDMA high?<br />Can anyone who has &quot;hippyflipped&quot; give me some more info?

				In theory, the two should balance each other out. Just don&#039;t take too much of either, MDMA and Mushrooms gave me a pretty nauseating trip the one time I tried it.

				I did this once, might have gone a little overboard though. Puked my guts out on the come up then proceeded to have a great time and yes, it might have felt longer than just mdma, but i could be wrong. I was just so damn high:)

				Puking up drugs is a waste of drugs.<br />Id say start with relatively small doses of both, then take some more mdma later if you feel like you need more, as they will play off each other.

Good luck

				hippie flip! I have tried the combination once or twice. Honestly when I take MDMA, I am usually in&nbsp; club or festival and appreciate the energy component. And not really looking for visuals or to laugh constantly.

				What causes bad trips on shrooms? I have recently experienced confusion, panic, feeling both hot and cold at once, and the feeling of being on a verge of a seizure while my mate had an awesome trip on the same batch o&#039; shrooms. My last trip was really good though.
