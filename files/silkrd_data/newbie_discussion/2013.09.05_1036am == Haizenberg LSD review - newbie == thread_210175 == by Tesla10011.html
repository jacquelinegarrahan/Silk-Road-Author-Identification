				Well, i couldnt post on the vendors official thread, since my account is new, and i keep creating a new one due to password lost and tormail shutdown.<br /><br />so if someone could transfer this post there it would be great.<br /><br />All right, been procrastinating this for a while due to my traveling in the past month, but I must admit Haizenberg is one hell of a Vendor, 5 stars from all aspects. <br /><br />I am not an expert when it comes to LSD, but for a beginner I must say it was one amazing experience, from researching about it, to the calm down. Ordering from SR and the way things went smooth ordering and communicating with the Vendor receiving the product and trying it with a blind faith of the quality gave me a chance to have a great experience, opened up a lot of doors to me. One more time Thank you Haizenberg.<br /><br />Ok, now to the report;<br /><br />communication : this vendor is really trying hard to keep up with the customers questions and emails, and I could tell from the amount of orders he is receiving and the time it took him to answer my email, I give him 5.<br />Price: I would say reasonable but as I said I am not an expert, from searching around the net and street wise I would say it is really reasonable, considering the comfort of the delivery method.<br />Shipping time: almost 11 days to Mid. East<br />Stealth: Here where you guys must give this vendor a trophy, he delivered to one of the toughest countries, a place where you heard stories about on how hard it is to pull something like this and it is pretty risky, well considering 99% of the risk lay on me, but I am proud of this vendor for delivering, and also we must take in consideration that its LSD, kind of easier than other subst. So yeah still amazing.<br />Quality: from my experience, I would say it is god damn amazing, much stronger than other stuff I got from another vendor also here on SR. but cant really give up more on this matter since I am still new to this.<br /><br />The story; Started with a full blotter 100 ug, around 10 pm. Under my tunge for almost 30 min then swallowed. <br />Started to feel the effect after almost 40 min to an hour from there, euphoria feeling and, light visual effect, sharper colors and little bit of kind of delayed images with fast head movements. <br />Body high started almost after an hr and so from swallowing, relaxed muscle specially feet and lower body.<br />After 1:30m min, face felt really good, wide smile and really good feeling, colors getting really amazing. By this time I had to start listening to music, and relax and let the trip take me to the unknown. <br /><br />For almost 2 hrs, from there, visual effects and sound delay or speed kind of got sync. Thoughts and unconscious ideas started to manifest in the music I am listening to, and correlated to visuals I started to see on wallpapers and texture of furniture and so many other things, It was like a video clip of my unconscious thoughts dancing on the music in the back ground, at some point I felt like I am getting some clear message from myself to myself lol, cant explain this, really, it was like my brain was explaining things to me in a happy way.<br /><br />After almost 3 to 4 hrs passed I started to get really into the trip but more visual, andi was sinking in my chair, a lot of mind exploring, and cant get into details with that, but I must say, music plays a great roll in this, and the atmosphere of the trip, choose your music wisely.<br /><br />From there the trip started to vanish gradually just like it started, but it took a long time for the whole effect to go away, I would say the whole thing lasted at least for good 9-10 hrs, to a point where I was just feeling light body high with no visual or any other feelings.<br /><br />Sleep was great after that, and next day was an amazing one. No after effect of any bad leftovers from the trip. Just a lot of things to go over and think about from things you experienced from the trip.<br /><br />I hope I could write the whole experience in a better way, but I didnt take any notes or any observation from any one since I was solo. But my next trip will be dedicated for a good review.
