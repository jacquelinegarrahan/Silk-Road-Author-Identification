				Hello everyone! I&#039;ve been on the road for about a year now, but this is my first time posting in the forums. Happy to be here.<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to share my methods of MDMA ingestion and possibly get feedback/hear your stories. In all my reading here, I haven&#039;t read about anyone who doses the way that I dose, so I&#039;d be interested to hear if there&#039;s a specific reason why not.<br /><br />NOTE: Space out your trips and don&#039;t take too much MDMA! Neutotoxicity bad!<br /><br />I used to purchase pills until I realized how much cheaper it would be to just buy MDMA crystals. But having the crystal/power form means it&#039;s a lot less obvious how to dose.<br /><br />Initially, I tried plugging (inserting it in the rectum). I got my scale and put a shot glass on it, pressing tare so that the weight would be zero with the shot glass. Then I proceeded to measure out 100mg, add a little water, pull it up with a needle-less syringe, and shoot it up there.<br /><br />I found that, unlike taking a pill, this caused me stomach distress for the first hour of come up. After an hour, when I was starting to come up, I measured out 60 percent of the initial dose, added some water, and just drank it quickly â€” trying to swallow before I could taste all the chemicals.<br /><br />It was great, of course.<br /><br />For my next trip (after time passes, of course) I wasn&#039;t really in the mood to plug, so I followed the same ritual and just drank the initial dose. I&#039;d swallow fast, taste it a little but not much, and that was that. The taste went away within seconds.<br /><br />I found that the trip was just as powerful as taking MDMA rectally. Maybe even stronger.<br /><br />Now, whenever I dose, I just measure it in a shot glass, add some water, and swallow. Super fast and painless and doesn&#039;t require any empty gel caps, pill presses, or anal penetration.<br /><br />While I&#039;m obviously not the first person to dose this way, I can&#039;t seem to find anyone else who does. Everyone recommends gel caps or parachuting.<br /><br />Do people avoid just drinking the MDMA because of the taste? Or is there something else I may not know?<br /><br />Thanks!

				See, I don&#039;t mind a little anal penetration...if it&#039;s working towards some greater good. Like the occasional finger in the ass during a blow job can be mind blowing. Or that time I may or may not have put a ton of hash up my ass for an international flight (young and dumb).<br /><br />But I&#039;ve found absolutely no difference between squirting it up my ass and just drinking it. As much as I *want to believe...*

That&#039;s partly what made me say I wouldn&#039;t plug. Well, at least with plugging you don&#039;t have to fish it out I suppose!<br /><br />Christ it&#039;s a long fucking way to 50 the honest way!<br /><br />

				The syringe without a needle is a good idea, never thought of that.&nbsp; I myself can handle the taste of mdma without an issue.&nbsp; Growing up, I had issues swallowing pills, any pills.&nbsp; It was all in my head so I just chewed everything.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t till after about a year of pretty heavily doing mdma(stupid i know) in my teens that I got past the swallowing of pills issues.&nbsp; The funny thing is the first pill I ever swallowed was a pressed X pill after a buddy &quot;coached&quot; me thru it during an already incredible roll.&nbsp; I was incredibly thankful and to this day we both laugh about it 10+ years later.&nbsp; Sounds pretty lame I know but it was an amazing accomplishment at the time!!!&nbsp; I felt unstoppable,lol!!!
