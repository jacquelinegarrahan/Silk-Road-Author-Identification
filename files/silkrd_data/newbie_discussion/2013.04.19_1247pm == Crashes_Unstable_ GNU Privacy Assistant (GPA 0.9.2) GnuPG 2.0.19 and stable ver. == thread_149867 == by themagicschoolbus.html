				OS: Windows 7 64-bit<br />Software: Beta and Stable releases, same issues<br /><br />In terms of GPA 0.9.2 GnuPG 2.0.19 beta AND stable builds,&nbsp; these apps are a piece of shit!! While it does work, it crashes a lot. I open the application and click around the app, and when I need to copy my Public Key, it crashes. Sometimes when I generate a new key, it crashes.<br /><br />Its already kind of a bitch trying to figure out how to actually get PGP just to work... after reading through the &quot;how to&quot; guides which is 50% fluff shit I have to filter through to find what I really need to know (an answer to my question which can be explained in TWO LINES... )<br /><br />Yeah I know the application is free/GNU... however I&#039;ve also used a lot of freeware that wasn&#039;t a crashing piece of shit... and I really like a stable app.<br /><br />What applications are you people using, besides the GNU package? Do you guys use the GPA&#039;s clipboard to type a message of your address to encrypt it? That&#039;s just the way I&#039;ve been doing it in GPA... not sure if there is a more efficient way to go about this....<br /><br />For example, to Import someone&#039;s certificate (PGP PUBLIC KEY), do I really have to copy/paste the block, and save it under a filename .asc, then manually import it? <br />I figure with the way PGP Public keys are posted on forums, the GNU apps should have a function where you can paste someone&#039;s Public Key into a window, and then just say.. SAVE AS CERT or something like that??<br /><br />What applications are you guys using to manage PGP messages? I really don&#039;t see the point in having TWO applications, Kleopatra AND GPA.... since GPA can practically do the same shit Kleopatra does... <br />

				Try GPG4USB -----&gt; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />It&#039;s much better than GPG4Win. You can import public keys straight from the clipboard.<br /><br />And yes, you use the clipboard to type your address or whatever your message may be. That&#039;s pretty much how it is with all GPG programs. <br /><br />

				And in reference to your edit, you don&#039;t need Kleopatra. You just need GPA if you decide you want to stick with GPG4Win. But I doubt you will once you use GPG4USB.

				^^^ That was your 666th post&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thanks for the extremely fast responses people... <br /><br />I will definitely look into GPG 4 USB... <br /><br />I&#039;m also running a lot of searches for alternative PGP managers..... this the standard GNU bundle needs to be way better organized.

				A hahah.... so I open up GPG4USB... and the wizard asks me if I want to import keys from GnuPG. You click on the button to &quot;Import keys from GnuPG&quot; and an error message pops up!!!<br />&quot;Couldn&#039;t locate GnuPG home directory&quot;... <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter, no big deal. I already imported my key from file. I love how when I export the key in GnuPG, it doesn&#039;t append the .asc file name, but when it imports keys, it looks for .asc and .txt... <br /><br />Seriously... I understand the developers are trying to help out by releasing free software for the world to use... but if you&#039;re gonna half ass it, it makes things look bad. First impressions, dude. Like if its gonna work like shit, then don&#039;t even bother putting it out there, further diluting the total number of PGP applications to download, making it difficult separating the good from the bad. <br /><br />GnuPG is a hunk of shit, no doubt.&nbsp; Its like Pheonix miner and GUIminer. They&#039;re both &quot;out there&quot;, but they&#039;re the worst possible apps to use, but most commonly mentioned applications in write-ups. GUIminer... just &quot;stops mining&quot;... then wtf is the point... and of course its not fixed by the developer, but still hosted. Phoenix... I recall a thread about the 2.0 release with no documentation...
