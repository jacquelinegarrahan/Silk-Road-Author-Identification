				Is this link for real?<br /><br />https://www.bitinstant.com/<br /><br />Does this mean bitinstant is again accepting those from US? Is this site for real,because it looks like you can still transfer to Mt&nbsp; Gox and pay through bitinstant.<br /><br />Ugh. I am sooooo confused.&nbsp; And I have extremely limited funds and I need to order on Wed and receive by Friday or Sat or I am in huge trouble.<br /><br />Can anyone explain what is going on and if the above link is valid/legit?

				I am sooooo confused.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t see an option to go get them at CVS or Walmart so now how do I purchase where it will be INSTANT?&nbsp; I am in the Midwest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can I do debit or credit card or paypal, and if so, will it still be INSTANT (and I mean within a few hours like the CVS deal was?)<br /><br />Please help, because I HAVE to order on Wednesday at the latest!

				What about vendors on Silk Road? I am afraid to use them, even with good feedback, because I have limited funds and cannot afford to get ripped off.&nbsp; :(

				I used them again today, and had my coins in just about an hour.&nbsp; I went to Walmart, but there are quite a few locations listed for cash deposits.&nbsp; If you click on &quot;Fees &amp; Locations&quot; at the top and scroll down a little bit, there is a section that says &quot;Cash Deposit Locations&quot; and allows you to input an address or zipcode to find locations nearest to you.&nbsp; Good luck!

				Thank you PrettyinGreen.&nbsp; I did find it the correct place with the drop down for CVS.<br /><br />So what is all the fuss? Did they suddenly change it back to U.S. again? That is why I was worried about possible fake sites, etc.<br /><br />Does anyone know what changed? I&nbsp; am glad they again accept U.S. but why say they did not when they do or was it just for a short time or what? So confusing for someone so easily confused, lol

				There was an entire site re-design. They require you to register an account and give your personal information to verify your identity. It&#039;s a little more intrusive, but having bitcoin purchases attached to personal identity is not really a big deal. Besides the new design of the site, everything appears to be the same.

				So CVS is the best place to go?&nbsp; I&#039;ve found other places that seem to know what they&#039;re doing better.
