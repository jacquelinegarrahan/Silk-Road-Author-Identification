				So the last time I was on SR, I was highly interested in buying a couple pills of MDMA. I posted a thread to get feedback from members about shipment to Texas etc. and received a lot of heat when I bitched out and decided not to do it. Thus the negative feedback on my profile. Maybe I sounded a bit pompous, but that&#039;s in the past so it&#039;s whatever.<br /><br />I&#039;m back now and interested in ordering a sample of two grams of bud from a new vendor. I bought the necessary bitcoins to cover the transaction and just transferred them over to my SR account this morning. I can&#039;t even check to see if they&#039;ve hit yet because some small dick asshole thinks he&#039;s going to get 25 bitcoins by DDoSing the main site. Regardless, I wanted to create a thread asking for everyone&#039;s opinion once more while I wait for the page to load. I live in a small, quiet city right outside a major metropolitan city in Texas. Texas has some of the most ridiculous laws regarding marijuana use in the states. They&#039;ll string you up for possessing a simple seed. They slammed a Jamaican nationalist with 30 years in prison just for possessing seeds.<br /><br />What are the chances anything will happen should USPS find that my package contains illegal substances? It&#039;s only going to contain two grams of marijuana and I hardly think that warrants a controlled delivery. But, knowing Texas, I can&#039;t say for sure. I probably have half a gram of marijuana left at my residence, as well as a bubbler, screens, a grinder and rolling papers. If my package arrives safely, it won&#039;t even be enough to top me off at an 1/8th of an O.<br /><br />I plan on having the item delivered to my house in my name, but I probably won&#039;t open it for a few days. I might even try the &quot;return to sender&quot; trick. I&#039;m not real sure about how to deny all of this. Some people say I should have it delivered to an abandoned building in another state addressed to Cindy LooHoo while driving a friend&#039;s car to pick it up and others think I should attempt to blend in without worry.<br /><br />I mean, honestly, are they going to be so worried about two grams of marijuana being sent to me that they&#039;re going to spend the time and money to apprehend me and investigate accordingly? I highly doubt it, but I just wanted to know what some of you others think considering I live in rogue ass Texas.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t feel like waking up to flashbangs and gun shots while a fucking SWAT team murders my family members and dogs.<br /><br />Thanks, guys!

				I really don&#039;t see them busting out the swat time for 2 measly grams... especially when you got guys running across the boarder with 50 Lbs strapped to their backs and whatnot.<br /><br />I myself would go with the direct shipment to my house.&nbsp; The abandoned house etc.... that&#039;s just begging for trouble.&nbsp; <br /><br />

It just seems like a waste of resources. If it were a pound or, hell, maybe even half an O then maybe but, it just seems like two grams would hardly be worth it... Thanks for your feedback!<br /><br />Edit: I just placed the order. For fuck&#039;s sake, I hope I don&#039;t go to prison over this shit!

				lol I recon your overthinking this dude, but I guess I say that because from my part of the world there preety relaxed on drugs and 30 years for seeds? WTF man and they say we live in free countrys but they take 30 years off someones life for carrying plant seeds, wow. Goodluck with it man, I think after your order arrives saftley and you do a couple more youll look back and laugh at this thread :)

				I&#039;m probably freaking out over nothing, but I guess it&#039;s better to be too paranoid than too careless. Do you guys recommend I do the &quot;return to sender&quot; trick or do you suspect I&#039;ll be OK enough to kick black and blow some herb after a long week?

				One thing you may want to do is not mention your location on these forums ...&nbsp; other than that, I think you&#039;ll be fine.

				well for one get a vendor that ships usps priority in one of those flat rate boxes they need a warrant to even open those packages <br />two just dont buy weed over silkroad i think its over-priced and the risk associated is high if the vendor doesnt know how to send it properly<br />HOWEVER you could just get a fake ID and Fake social security card go to the post office and get a P.O. box&nbsp; and pick up only at night when the post office is closed so if a package never comes just ditch the p.o. box no connections to you.. that was my method but before i went in at night i would always circle the surrounding area for unmarked vehicles or surveillance then park with the vehicle backed in not to leave the plate number exposed since i didnt rock a front plate. yes its just a package but its a package that is not only containing a schedule 1 drug your receiving it through the mail which in its self is another felony offence and we all know once you get caught your fucked for life no REAL employer will take you with a felony just food for thought

I contacted him prior to making the purchase and we discussed a few factors including his method of shipping. He seems to be on par with how to ship items. I don&#039;t want to disclose any details, but he mentioned doing all he can to prevent particles from ending up on the outside of the bags and that sits really well with me. I know that odors permeate vacuum sealed packages (and fast, too) but I don&#039;t think two grams is going to be enough to warrant any type of controlled delivery. If anything, I&#039;d suspect a love letter or attempt to reel me into picking it up. The resources required to take me down over $40 hardly seems worth it.<br /><br />Then again, I could be entirely wrong and I might end up spending a mandatory six months in a state jail. It&#039;s all a calculated risk, I suppose.

And do they have the resources to do so? Think about it, how many orders a few grams in Texas and around you? Probably more than you! And all the smugglers, real gangsters, heroin etc- why come and throw flashbangs on your dog?
