				[2] As a member of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family, dapoxetine was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, dapoxetine is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast acting property makes it suitable for the treatment of PE but not as an antidepressant.[3]<br /><br />From Wikipedia, in fact All anti depressives do give erection problems, just SSRI (which are about the weakest SSRI drug often often don&#039;t give are problematic erection failures).<br />Those two is a part of the answer, the third answer is = Kamagra.<br /><br />We can promise that we would not have published them at all together with for example SNRI, MAO or even electric shock treatment.<br /><br />EDIT: We know that it won&#039;t fix the erection problem, that was just information from us about &quot;facts-that-are-fun-to-learn--but-forgotten-in-a-week&quot;.

				&quot;Patients should be advised not to use dapoxetine in combination with recreational drugs. Recreational drugs with serotonergic activity such as ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may lead to potentially serious reactions if combined with dapoxetine. These reactions include, but are not limited to, arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and serotonin syndrome.&quot; #1 on Google.<br /><br />Besides you wont need no medicine to delay ejaculation while on mdma.

				Indeed drugs should be used with caution. That&#039;s why i quoted Priligy&#039;s data sheet. Your recommendations seem very irresponsible. Do you have any trustworthy source saying the combo is ok?<br /><br />http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/p/Priligytab.pdf<br />http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/SPC_PIL/Pdf/humspc/Priligy%20film-coated%20tablet%20SmPC.doc<br />http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=20071127000130&amp;DocTypeID=7<br />

For example, my Daily medication list is as follow (this is the only ones that somehow affect the serotin or noradrenalin:<br />450mg Venlafaxin<br />90mg Mirtazapin<br />100mg Valdoxan<br />162mg Concerta<br />450mg Voxra<br />45mg Abilify<br /><br />And i also use on top of that use my combo of XTC/DEX/KAM 2-3 times a week and never came close to SS.<br /><br />Of course everyone is a individual, but regarding to my medication I&#039;d say it is impossible to get S-syndrome on just the combo we suggested.<br /><br />Hope you understand why I am skeptic!<br /><br />Sincerely<br />MailPharma
