				I&#039;ve decided to purchase methylone for the first time from the Silk Road as I&#039;ve used MDMA multiple times in the past, and wanted to try something similar.<br />Methylone intrigued me particularly because it is known to be a more &quot;chill&quot; drug of the two, less manic and better for home tripping, which is how I use MDMA anyways.<br />The problem is, most people who use methylone seem to have been hardcore MDMA users at one point, who take much larger doses than me.<br />Can somebody recommend me a reasonable methylone/mdma comparison range?<br />My ideal dose of MDMA is only 120mg, and the most I&#039;ve taken in a night was only 160mg (which was quite uncomfortable by the way)<br />What dose of methylone sounds optimal for me if I want a nice, chill, minimally-stimulating and introspective roll?<br />

				I&#039;ve got quite a bit of experience with methylone and assuming you&#039;re average in terms of weight 200mgs is a good dose. Although some might consider this heavy. You could start out with something like 150mgs and do smaller 50-100mg bumps after an hour to extend the trip or you could do this with the 200 your call. Methylone seems to be a bit shorter of a duration. Some also describe it as less intense. You can also take rather high doses of methylone 3-400ish but it would be much more unpleasant and I&#039;d always rather wish I took more than less. Stay safe!

				Would you say that a 150mg methylone starting dosage is simlilar to 120 mg MDMA potency wise?

				Also as a point of reference I was never a hardcore MDMA user. The doses 150-200mgs doses would be perfect for a first time. You can always start lower and just space out your rolls if you are concerned! Erowid is also a wonderful resource on this sort of thing. I&#039;d say by comparison 150mgs would be a little less potent but it would definitely be a great place to start.

				Alright thank you. I go on erowid pretty often, but the information on methylone dosage doesn&#039;t seem up to par at all

				No problem I do hope you enjoy methylone it is a rather nice compound! Yeah you are right I didn&#039;t realize how much the doses they had posted overlapped. After your first experience with methylone you&#039;ll definitely have a solid idea where you want to go next. Just space it out and remember those antioxidants!!&nbsp; As to the 500mg I&#039;d prefer not to have tunnel vision with everything being blurry as all fuck and feeling like death. Tried that once never again...

				yeah if your not around 300 lbs you wont need 500 mg. I have gone through nearly 700 mg in a night of what I thought was mdma. Once I noticed how much I used I knew it was bk. I would be dead on molly.
