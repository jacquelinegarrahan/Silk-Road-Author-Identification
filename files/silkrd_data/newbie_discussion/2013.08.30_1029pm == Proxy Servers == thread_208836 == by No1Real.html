				I am new to SR hence the reason I am posting in the noob section. I wasn&#039;t even aware the &quot;deep&quot; web and sites like SR existed until I read a tech article featuring it about a month ago. Anyway I was intrigued and hooked at the same time. I have been an avid pill user (OC&#039;s when they were around and then Perc 30&#039;s) since 1999 and when I downloaded the TOR browser and actually saw the listings on SR I thought I was in heaven. I was never skeptical about the site or if it was a scam because by the time I read about SR it was already getting quite a bit of press and the attention of LE and government.<br /><br />Anyway I consider myself to be a pretty through guy so I started doing my research. The first site I came across was (http://silkroaddrugs.org/) which is a basic road map informing the average Internet user how to access the deep web and sites like SR. I followed the steps to a tee and within a day I was browsing SR. Subsequent to reading that article I came across another one [NOTE - it is not longer online (http://silkroaddrugs.wordpress.com/)], however I was able to read it before it went offline. I can&#039;t remember the exact words but I believe the Dread Pirate Roberts himself was quoted in this article and recommended that when using the TOR browser to access SR NOT to use IP blockers/proxy servers. This was at odds with the first article I read and got me thinking.<br /><br />I signed up for a month-long membership to a service called IP Vanish (www.ipvanish.com) and have used it sparingly. From what I understand TOR already blocks the user&#039;s IP address and triple-bounces it off servers all around the world. If that&#039;s the case I don&#039;t see the need for another proxy server to go along with the anonymity the TOR browser already provides. My membership to IP Vanish just expired and based on what I&#039;ve read since I signed up I don&#039;t see a need to renew my membership.<br /><br />I just wanted to get other users opinions. Do most of you just access SR via the TOR browser or do you in fact use another IP blocker/proxy server as another added layer of protection (I&#039;ve actually read using proxy servers makes it easier to get tracked and that using TOR alone is the safest route). Your thoughts and input is appreciated.<br /><br />P.S. - I know what PGP encryption does but for the life of me I can&#039;t get it to work. Can anyone recommend a good PGP service I can download so I may be able to communicate in encrypted form?<br /><br />Thank You

				Use TorBrowser.&nbsp; PGP - google gpg4win.&nbsp; When downloading and installing make sure you check the box for GPA and uncheck Kleopatra.&nbsp; Kleopatra is a waste of time.&nbsp; GPA is relatively simple.&nbsp; There is a really good guide which will help guide you through the GPA process in the SR forums.&nbsp; I pissed away much time trying to get Kleopatra to work....again, use GPA!
