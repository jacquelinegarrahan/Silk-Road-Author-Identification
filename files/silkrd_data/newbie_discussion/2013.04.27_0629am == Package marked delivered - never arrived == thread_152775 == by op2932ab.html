				Hello,<br /><br />I recently ordered one gram of MDMA (domestic, US to US) to a PO Box. The vendor informed me it was shipped on the 12th and arrived on the 15th, with the appropriate tracking information to show it. However, I never saw the order in the PO box. What could this mean? Was it simply lost in the mail, stolen, or was the order seized? I&#039;ve already finalized the transaction, but I&#039;d like some piece of mind as to what happened with this order.<br /><br />Thank you.

				i dont know but i dont think that it can be lost after it was stated as &quot;delivered&quot;. Maybe the post office found out whats inside and stole it or probably seized.

Since the order was so small, I think it&#039;s likely that I&#039;ll only receive a love letter. The consensus is to just ignore it, correct? What&#039;s the time frame on when it will be received?

				Did you ask the attendant where you PO box is if there is any mail that wouldn&#039;t it into the box?&nbsp; That might be the reason it was marked delivered but not found.<br /><br />How long has it been since it was marked delivered?&nbsp; If it&#039;s only been a couple of hours it may be it was marked delivered when it was taken by the delivery person and may still be in transit to your box.&nbsp; <br /><br />That happened to me one time.&nbsp; I checked the tracking and it said it was delivered, yet there was nothing in my mailbox.&nbsp; It was delivered a few hours later.<br /><br />It may also have been delivered to the wrong address and the person receiving it hasn&#039;t sent it back or just threw it out.<br /><br />Finally, one other option is you have been scammed by the vendor.&nbsp; They could easily send it to themselves or send an empty envelope to an address within your zip code, knowing it will be delivered. This is unlikely, considering the amount involved, not really worth it to go to all that trouble.<br />

There is one other person who has access to that mailbox, and they did not receive a call from the post office informing them that there was a package that wouldn&#039;t fit - it shouldn&#039;t be an issue with the small amount ordered, anyway. <br /><br />The package was marked as delivered on the 16th, so it has been roughly a week and some days. I did not see the package in the box on the 16th, nor the 17th or 18th when I checked yet again. Asking the vendor about this, they only gave me the tracking information stating it was delivered and said there was nothing they could do for me.<br /><br />The vendor in question has very good reviews, and I clearly typed my correct address and encrypted it before placing the order. <br /><br />Should I reveal the vendor just in case?

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t reveal the vendor. Seeing that it is a PO box, if it did get delivered to the wrong box and someone said return to sender its gone to a ficticious&nbsp; address I would assume. You might be SOL if the vendor isnt helping.
