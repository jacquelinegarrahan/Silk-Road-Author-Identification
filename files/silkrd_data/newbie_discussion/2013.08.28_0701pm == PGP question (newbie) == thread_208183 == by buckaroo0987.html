				Or should I say a GPG question?<br /><br />I&#039;m using PGP4WIN (which I got from GPG) with Kleopatra.<br /><br />I&#039;m been going through the manual, learning how to use it, but when it comes to decrypting a message the only thing the manual explains how to do is use a plugin for Outlook. <br /><br />Naturally I don&#039;t want to use outlook... so how do I go about decrypting an email or message (using this program)?<br /><br />Thanks

				I can&#039;t really speak on behalf of Kleo - I tried it and just got impatient and looked for an alternative. I know this doesn&#039;t answer your question, but if you&#039;re up for following a super simple tutorial that got me up and running in a solid 20 minutes, check out the guide I found that&#039;s in my sig.

				OK, I think I got it figured out.<br /><br />All these guides leave out that you have to put the message into another program .. some kind of text editor, then save the file and THEN it will let you decrypt it.<br /><br />That worked, but I am definitely not liking the idea that I have to save a file with this information in it. Seams like one more trail to me...

				Yes, it means the little icon next to you date/time, not on the program itself. I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s called in English but you said you figured it out.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208183.msg1499503#msg1499503">Quote from: buckaroo0987 on August 28, 2013, 08:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">OK, I think I got it figured out.<br /><br />All these guides leave out that you have to put the message into another program .. some kind of text editor, then save the file and THEN it will let you decrypt it.<br /><br />That worked, but I am definitely not liking the idea that I have to save a file with this information in it.

You don&#039;t need to save the document obviously, it&#039;s just there so that you can copy and paste it. You could even write your message in an email without sending it, it would work too.<br /><br />Just write your adress into a text file, copy it, encrypt it and that&#039;s it. No need to save anything mate :)
