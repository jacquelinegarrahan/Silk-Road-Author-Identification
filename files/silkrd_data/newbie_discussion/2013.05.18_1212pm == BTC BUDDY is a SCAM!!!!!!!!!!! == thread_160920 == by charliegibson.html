				I sent BTC Buddy an MP for $100. Brand new - purchased 20 mins before I sent him my order. My order was cancelled with no reason given - which would not be an issue, shit happens sometimes. Went to purchase coins from another vendor and that vendor (reputable vendor) told me the card was empty. In short BTC Buddy cashed out my card, cancelled my order and kept my MP without sending me the coins. I wrote to BTC Buddy and really hope he does the right thing. If he was getting slammed for no good reason I absolutely feel for him but if he was scamming then so not cool. I am hoping he does the right thing -- should he send me my bit coins I will absolutely be back on this thread and any other stating the fact that he did indeed come thru and made good on the deal. Hope this is the case as I never did anything to him except try and conduct &quot;honest&quot; business. MYB
