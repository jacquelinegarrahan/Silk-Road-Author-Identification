				Hello everyone! I got kinda confused after reading guides to buy from SR and I need someone to fill some questions I got so I can make my first SR purchase a fact. <br />Well first of all, is there any way to buy bitcoins anonymously? Or should I just go and buy from Localbitcoins? Do you suggest any other website to buy? And how do I transfer them to SR?<br />Then what about my anonymity to the seller. I heard there is some way to generate your address and be more safe. Then, I don&#039;t have a shipping address except my home address, should I just use this? <br />Thats all for now, hope someone is willing to help. <br /><br />EDIT: I registered an account at OkPay but it asks for ID verification and even a document of my address. Do you think it&#039;s safe to send it to them or should I look for another way to get some bitcoins? Should I ask the seller if he can send bitcoins directly to my SR wallet? (I wont say it&#039;s for SR though, only give him the code)

				on localbitcoins when you start a trade you get the sellers bank account info to make a transfer. but you can also use this info to go into your local branch of his bank and pay a cash deposit straight into his bank. just make sure you write down the numbers exactly, especially, and this can&#039;t be stressed enough, the reference number. the reference number is very very important. just make sure you can get to the bank well within the 90 minute time frame from when you started the deal with the seller on localbitcoins. its usually best to message the seller at the start to mention that you will be doing a cash deposit. you get a few that will be fussy about it but the majority don&#039;t mind just as long as you pay them.<br /><br />as with the address, i have never bothered to encrypt it once and never had a problem. i&#039;m only a buyer so LE couldn&#039;t really care less about me. they could drive round the streets and catch people for possession if they really want to, its a lot easier. and even if they did go to that trouble, its only a possession charge, doesn&#039;t bother me in the slightest.

				I have found someone who only accept bank deposit through his country only, so I can not make it happen. He does work with OkPay mostly. And I did choose him cause he the only one who accept an amount so little and have high feedback. So I have to make an OkPay account in order to deal with him.<br />So you just give the seller your real address and thats all? <br />How do you transfer Bitcoins from Localbitcoins to SR?

				if you click on account at the top of your silk road page it will give you a long address that is just a series of lower and upper case letters and numbers. this is your silk road wallet address. you paste that code into your wallet on localbitcoins, put in how much you want to transfer and click send. it will show up in your silk road account usually in around an hour, sometimes a bit longer tho. as long as you make triple sure that you put the exact sr wallet address in then it will turn up. copy/paste to be sure but also best to check it letter by letter before you click send. otherwise you will send it to someone else and won&#039;t get it back.<br /><br />there was a guy posting on here the other day saying he had another wallet address copied to his clipboard and put that in by mistake. reckons he lost quite a lot of money because of it. so always check before you click send<br />

				Thanks for your replies mate. Give me an answer to the address question. You simply send your details to the sellers?

				in your shopping cart there is a box for putting your address. you can encrypt it if you know how to use pgp and it makes you feel safer. i&#039;ve never bothered myself. as long as the cops don&#039;t catch me in possession of the drugs and my tails usb stick they really can&#039;t prove anything. the worst that could happen is my address would become hot for future deliveries but i got other addresses to use anyway. i guess everyone&#039;s circumstances are different to mine tho. if you were a high profile person then you&#039;d probably be best to take extra measures, but for average joe there isn&#039;t that big a risk to penalty ratio in my opinion.

				I&#039;m European and in my country there&#039;s not many sellers and those who are selling some got the price for BTC about 140% higher than others. So I&#039;d rather buy some outside my country. So I just type my country and select all online offers. Cash deposit is called SEPA bank transfer on localbitcoins right? <br /><br />Will it be safe if I give the seller my SR deposit code to send BTC directly here?

				Well I think I should choose the cash deposit option, but somebody please tell me what is the best way for me not to get scammed? Do I need a wallet? And how should I done this transaction? I go to the bank, send the money to the seller, then how should I know that I&#039;m not gonna get scammed even if he have high feedback rate?

				i&#039;m not really familiar with sepa, but a lot actually say cash deposit, however most of the ones that just say bank transfer will also allow a deposit.<br /><br />and no you can&#039;t give them your sr wallet. if they don&#039;t deposit into your lbtc wallet then they have no proof with lbtc that they finalized the deal. you would be able to make a dispute and win if they did that. besides when you open a transaction their btc to the value you are asking for go into escrow. lbtc release them after the seller confirms the deal is done. <br /><br />transferring from your lbtc wallet to sr is easy tho.<br /><br />finally you can never be 100% that something won&#039;t go wrong. but if you stick with sellers that have a good rep then it is very unlikely they are going to want to ruin that rep and lose on sales that would make them more money than what you&#039;ve just sent them. but like with sr sellers, always check their history, rep and feedback to get an idea if they are a legitimate and consistent seller.

				i dont need an escrow account for that? I only have a LBTC account and a bitcoin wallet which I made right now. I just go to the bank, get a number of my transaction as proof, and tell the seller I made the payment through a bank? thats all? and he just sends me the BTC to my LBTC wallet? then from LBTC i transfer them to my SR wallet? <br />of course he&#039;s a verified seller with high feedback, but if hes about to scam you, what happens then?

				you&#039;re getting it all wrong. the escrow is built into localbitcoins. there is no choice. like when you buy on sr your coin goes into the sr escrow. when you buy on lbtc the btc goes into the localbtc escrow. it helps protect you. if you trade outside lbtc with a seller then when you pay money into his account he can just ignore you. you won&#039;t even be able to open a resolution with lbtc or even leave the seller bad feedback and affect his score. you&#039;ll just be giving your money away to a stranger on the internet with no guarantees or safeguards.<br /><br />and just so you know, when you use an offline wallet, even just to put your coins into for a minute before sending them on to sr, they will charge you a percentage. this just adds to the price of your drugs even more. just send them straight to sr, they tumble them anyway.
