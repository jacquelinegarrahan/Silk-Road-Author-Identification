				Hi...first time on the forum, been browsing the road for a while and just got my btc in my wallet.&nbsp; Anyone have a critique of this plan...<br /><br />My girl&#039;s going out of town in a couple of weeks so I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m going to buy one of Nod&#039;s 8balls of the time machine and go on a 24-36 hour coke binge.&nbsp; I could buy a couple 8balls locally and mix it in...I&#039;ll probably do the local stuff and then every couple hours do a power blast of Nod&#039;s stuff.<br /><br />Then when I come down I&#039;d like to smoke a little of Nod&#039;s BTH.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never, ever tried H but I&#039;m beyond curious, and especially for the comedown.&nbsp; In the past when I come down, 30mg of Hydro usually does the job.&nbsp; But I&#039;d like to try H and I&#039;m thinking I&#039;d smoke some BT and see what the effects are.&nbsp; How fucked up, sedated, opiated do you get smoking H?<br /><br />If I don&#039;t get great effects smoking it I could shoot it although I&#039;m really not too psyched for that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much to do or how to properly cook and filter.&nbsp; I suppose I could figure it out but all i want is a really, really, smooth and painless comedown from my white binge.&nbsp; And since I&#039;m taking 5 days off of work for the binge I&#039;ll just do the entire 1g of BTH which apparently isn&#039;t a lot.&nbsp; But for me it would be. <br /><br />I know going down the road of trying H for the first time out of curiousity isn&#039;t a genius plan, but I&#039;m the type of person who can do blow for a day and then come down and now do any more for a couple months or more.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty grounded and disciplined.&nbsp; I&#039;d just like to take my drug experimentation to the next level since I&#039;ve found the Road and would like to sample a greater array of products.&nbsp; My drugs of choice are pills, followed by weed which I smoke very little of, and then coke.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do coke repeatedly.&nbsp; I just blowout a couple 8balls every couple of months.&nbsp; I like benzos too but haven&#039;t done any in over a year.&nbsp; So this is my plan and I&#039;d like some advice on trying H, and I don&#039;t think I need any advice about Nod as he is highly recommended but any feedback for my first post would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks much.<br /><br />
