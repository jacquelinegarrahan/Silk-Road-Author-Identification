			<dd class="postbody">
				Instead of making a thread for spamming, lets make use of this to educate ourselves.<br /><br />General consensus says that tracking numbers are risky and most vendors don&#039;t provide shipping with tracking numbers. <br />Several people have said that checking your tracking number through Tor is a major red flag and will likely be intercepted by LE. The reason being that any server has the capability to detect whether someone is using encrypted web service like Tor, because the Tor exit nodes are public.<br /><br />Now my question is (to those tech-savy SR friends, but any input from anyone is also appreciated), what is the best way to check your tracking number if your vendor has provide you one?&nbsp; And what are some additional methods to strengthen security for a successful delivery? Here some some suggestions I&#039;ve dug up from searching the forums:<br />1. Using a proxy <br />2. Use VPN, then TOR<br />3. Use clearnet on a public wifi with little to no security<br />4. Don&#039;t even bother checking your parcel with tracking numbers unless you really need to<br />&nbsp;<br />ANY THOUGHTS IS APPRECIATED!<br /><br />IME this seems highly plausible, because I&#039;ve gotten a love letter from the customs for an international order in which the vendor provided a tracking number. At the time I was a big newbie to the whole SR thing and had been checking the order through the tracking number on TOR as well as on the clearnet (several times a day! which is a big no-no). It was no biggie though, because they were just prescriptions (not stimulants, benzos or opiates) but the package was seized.<br /><br />On a second account, another package of unscheduled substance was shipped to the same destination drop address. This order was from a different international vendor that provided tracking numbers. Stupidly, I still hadn&#039;t done my research and have been still using TOR to track my mail and checking it multiple times a day on the clearnet. Coincidentally, this package never made it to the mailbox, however it was held at the post office. When I went to pick it up from them, they required me to present an ID and give them signature.<br /><br />That is why I am so paranoid about orders with tracking numbers and the methods to check your package if you really need to.<br />

				Good, and even though vendors might not admit or give you a tracking number I can assure you 80% or more have it without you knowing, it&#039;s how they prove their shipment arrived at it&#039;s location if a transaction ever goes to resolution.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				The few times I&#039;ve been given a tracking number from here and bothered to check it I checked it on a busy public wifi. I&#039;m not an expert, but from what I&#039;ve read you shouldn&#039;t use tor in any circumstances, because as you said it gets flagged. Any of those methods would probably be fine except for #2, but I don&#039;t know which one would be best. #1 is just the easiest IMO and has worked for me.

				If you&#039;re really worried about anonymity when you&#039;re checking a tracked package, go to a public library or somewhere that has free internet access. I wouldn&#039;t see anything suspicious about checking your mail at a library as long as you have other tabs up to make it look like you&#039;re researching something obscure. Let&#039;s go with string theory, maybe something less interesting to keep prying eyes from your monitor.

				I don&#039;t see what benefit tracking gives. In the case of a non-arrival of an order, it&#039;s not like a tracking number is going to necessarily be trusted by the buyer.

				I think tracking numbers are very important in some cases. Those being when the vendor sometimes has issues with packages and does not easily offer refunds or reships. for example a mdma vendor from far over seas who ships internationally should be bought with a tracking number because when youre on day 28 you start to feel as though the vendor never sent the product to begin with. <br /><br />So in all, a tracking number is good to have for resolution and to know your product was sent. I usually dish out extra coin for tracking but don&#039;t check the tracking unless and i need to or when it has been a long while to check the status of it shipment. And when i track it at a library should be more than fine.

				Thank you for this thread! I recently got a tracking number for a SR shipment for the first and checked it without thinking about the consequences, then started wondering if I shouldn&#039;t do that. Most of the time I don&#039;t really need it. Maybe the next time I get one I just won&#039;t track it at all.

				About the postal service thing, am I wrong to think this might be conjecture and superstition? It&#039;s quite possible to detect the usage of a TOR exit node, VPN tunnel, proxies too, but that implies a more functional mail service and policing structure than most of us are familiar with.<br /><br />In related news, Torproject does have an official proxy service for use with its network. It&#039;s designed to beat packet inspection attempts that determine whether a person is working with Tor or not. People in Kazahkstan, Iran and IIRC China too need this extra layer to use TOR.

				checking your tracking number through Tor can actually compromise yourself, as it provides your address to anyone tracking your Tor session.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit &#039;evil genius&#039;, but you really don&#039;t want to reveal any info about yourself while you&#039;re going through Tor, as it can link to your whole current session.

				the way i was always told was to NEVER check the DCN&#039;s or Tracking numbers using TOR! they can see that and from what i have heard, they intercept... i dont know if this is entirely accurate but its what i have stuck to!

				Many useful tips, guys, thank you a lot! <br /><br />I believe it is better to be extra cautious when dealing with stuff. Is it really worth compromising security for convenience? It is a rhetorical question...<br /><br /><br />Entity

				I am glad I searched before acting and found this thread.<br /><br />I usually don&#039;t sweat this but with an international order sometimes you need to check in.<br /><br />I was trying to think on my own:&nbsp; clearnet or Tor?&nbsp; What are the possible implications?<br /><br />Clearnet from home would clearly be a terrible idea.&nbsp; That would basically eliminate the possibility of denying knowledge upon arrival if it came to that.<br /><br />It is speculative, but I think concerns about LEO flagging tracking via Tor are legitimate.&nbsp; Not worth the risk.<br /><br />Using a public machine e.g. a library is clearly the safest approach.<br /><br />I wonder if using my own laptop at a public wifi spot is risky due to browser history?&nbsp; Any opinions?&nbsp; Who knows if Firefox truly deletes history or if shadows remain...
