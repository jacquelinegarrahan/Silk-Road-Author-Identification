				Hello SRf-Community,<br /><br />now i collected a lot of experience on the road, but what is with the rest from the darknet?<br /><br />Before 2 weeks i ordered weed-products from the shop DeDope , <br />if i would believe TorShops, it would be a trusted shop!<br /><br />&quot;Shops with the &quot;Powered by TorShops&quot; link are verified by TorShops not to be scams.<br /><br />Any shop linking to this page with a &quot;Powered by TorShops&quot; link will be listed below. If its not listed here, its not verified by TorShops and most likely a scam!&quot;<br /><br />This stand on the TorShops-Site.<br />But on the forum from TorShops, i can´t start a new topic, or answering on other posts.<br />So i didn´t get help there...<br />I contacted the Admin, but no answer.<br /><br />So on the DeDope-Shop, i paid in over 80€ to get 10 gr from his Bubblegum.<br />Now my order is since 2 weeks in process.<br />I cant write to someone on this shop, nothing.<br /><br />You think i lost my money?<br /><br />King regards<br />bbcool

				From what I&#039;ve read, all of those sites were set up by TorShops themselves and are all scam sites, lulling you into a false sense of security with the &quot;Shops with the &quot;Powered by TorShops&quot; link are verified by TorShops not to be scams.&quot; I mean of course they&#039;re verified by TorShops not to be scams, they&#039;re set up by TorShops TO scam!!<br /><br />Never buy anywhere that you can&#039;t stay within the safety of an escrow system.<br /><br />Libertas
