				First I&#039;d like to say this does not refer to anything purchased on SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought maybe $40-$60 worth of work ever so often just for the rush over 20 years but never been my DOC ( I like to relax, benzos, a little H now and then, or a few beers).&nbsp; Never had a problem always and a 20 of work always lasts me for 2-3 hours doing it slow.&nbsp; Heart fast inability to think etc.<br /><br />Recently someone i&#039;ve known a while gave me 4 big ones for $60 and even 1/4 of it just gives a slight rush (less than 60 seconds).&nbsp; Taste very different from anything else almost like ashes and chest muscles don&#039;t get tight like usually, although i do cough more.&nbsp; I suspect it must be something like orajel with enough coke to tease but, never ran into such a thing.&nbsp; I&#039;m just curious, is this becoming common?&nbsp; My first experience was in 1988 for reference.&nbsp; Other than buying a turn blue test kit is there an easy way to see what it is?&nbsp; An anonymous trusty worthy lab to send to maybe.&nbsp; I&#039;m not upset and it isn&#039;t my thing, I just have my curiosity up would like to know.&nbsp; I googled forever and didn&#039;t find anything that made much sense.<br /><br />when I confronted the supplier his only answer was &quot;must of been the soap&quot;&nbsp; I asked if he used soap and he didn&#039;t answer just laughed.&nbsp; Anyway, this is my last time I&#039;ll purchase it as I really don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; There are far better things to spend $60 on SR.&nbsp; ;D
