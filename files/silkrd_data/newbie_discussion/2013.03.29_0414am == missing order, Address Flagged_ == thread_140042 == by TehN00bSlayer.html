				I&#039;m relatively new to SR and have had a handful of successful transactions. A recent order or mine (very small quantity) never showed up. The seller is currently now not responding (probably due to message volume). However there are many recent order reviews (within mins, hours) of this vendor from happy customers, who purchased the same product. I don&#039;t know if I can attribute this &quot;no show&quot;to the vendor backing out or whatever. <br />I have not received any letter/visit from LE. It&#039;s possible something has been lost in the mail, but the time frame doesn&#039;t seem to warrant this theory (weeks, domestic). In addition, my order before this one was delayed for a long time as well. It was a completely legal item, so it was delivered, only very late. So 2 orders in a row being mis-routed in the mail? (doubt it). As such, would you assume this recent order was seized and the address is now flagged?<br /><br />How the hell does flagging work? I don&#039;t know how the post office runs, so do they sort mail manually or electronically? If it&#039;s manual, I can&#039;t imagine a dude looking at each letter or whatever, and comparing it to a list of flagged addresses.<br /><br />My thoughts are to buy another legal item from the road, and see how long it takes to deliver. In the meantime, should i request a reship (or refund)? thoughts/opinions?<br /><br />i don&#039;t really have another place I can send orders to, so this would suck.

				I don&#039;t understand why it would be flagged if the order was legal? I&#039;m assuming you don&#039;t have DC/tracking?

				this outstanding order contained a small amount of controlled substance. The one prior, that was also delayed, was a legal item.&nbsp; No tracking on this particular one.

				I dont want to assume anything based off your situation, but it seems the new members have more issues than the vouched ones. It might be possible that the vendor assumed he could get away with not shipping out your order, and decided to keep the money. I too have had an order not go through, no response from the vendor.
