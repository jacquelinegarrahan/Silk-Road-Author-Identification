				I have installed the Tor browser and nothing else. Not that theres anything necessarily (apart from using this site) dodgy i want to do.. but are you completely untouchable using the web with this browser now? like if you made email addresses and facebooks on this browser, your IP logged to them is a tor IP?<br /><br />Is there anything added i need to for further protection other than just having the browser?

But, your IP is shown as one from Tor, instead of your actual IP.

				Yeah, i was just wondering if Tor worked elsewhere apart from SR. So can Tor IP&#039;&#039;s be traced just like regular sock proxies can but that it just takes longer kind of thing? has anyone here on the forums ever got busted.. either by having their Tor being traced or by a mistake they made on their own? thanks.

I&#039;m not an expert on the topic but I know that Tor provides protection against traffic analysis but cannot stop traffic confirmation (also called end-to-end correlation). If you need further explanation on this, google can help. I&#039;m not sure about the forums, but people have been busted through Silk Road, not sure on the circumstances.

				I probably won&#039;t be using it for anything else anyway so it doesn&#039;t matter.. but is it safe to run another browser at the same time just say firefox/google chrome.. like would it&nbsp; affect&nbsp; how the tor browser works at all? cause i;m only loading it for using this site then i&#039;m doing other stuff on another browser. thanks. also how many of you have your tor set to bridge relay?

				DON&#039;T use Tor for regular (legal) stuff.&nbsp; All of your Tor traffic to regular websites (not .onion) leaves through one of about 3000&nbsp; &quot;exit nodes&quot; (http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/) whose IP addresses are known.&nbsp; If a business wanted to filter accounts to look for ones that may be involved in shady activity, they could see which accounts have been accessed through Tor exit node IP addresses.&nbsp; This is why you&#039;ll see &quot;clearnet warning&quot; next to some links on the forums.&nbsp; Browsing on Tor is ok, just don&#039;t login to anything or in any way associate yourself with anything other than your anonymous identities.<br /><br />Keep your illicit activities and your legal ones separate.

				One of the most dangerous ways to compromise your security is to think you are &quot;untouchable&quot;!&nbsp; Always have redundant layers of security and stay mindful at all times.&nbsp; Tor is safe but nothing is untouchable if THEY want to get you.<br /><br />Always PGP your address!
