				I am away from home and am not comfortable having drugs sent to my house without me being there. I am buying a few things at different quantities so they are in my cart to keep track of that. I&#039;m not sure how the cart system works, if maybe the seller is notified if one of their products is put in a cart? Anyways is it okay if I leave these things in my cart for up to a few weeks? I&#039;m going to see if I can make a little money buying and selling BTC before I load up my account. So on top of me having a lot of stuff in my cart I have insufficient funds. Is this bad etiquette/against the rules for some reason?<br /><br />TL;DNR I&#039;m leaving a bunch of stuff in my cart with no money on my account, I&#039;ll buy everything in ~two weeks. Is this okay or should I empty my cart?

				It is not a problem.&nbsp; But do not be surprised if the items go away or the cart behaves somewhat strange. E.g. login and cart icon says 3 times, click it and only 1 item is there and icon now shows 1 items. This is because the item was already sold out or the vendor took down the listing.<br /><br />I recommend you add the vendors to your favourites list. It is more likey you can find them in the future this way.

				He&#039;s happy that he made it to 50 post count, and he&#039;s using this thread for his needless boasting (quality poster?).<br /><br />In my opinion, listings change quickly on most of the SR, with even trusted vendors taking down listings and running out of products often, so you might just get more confused. I personally just made a big list of all the drugs I want to try, and potential vendors for them, and the price. I take the couple weeks or months it takes to save up the money to follow up on vendors and make some better choices before making the final purchase.

				Instead of adding the items to your cart,why don&#039;t you just favorite the vendor and/or bookmark the item you want to buy?
