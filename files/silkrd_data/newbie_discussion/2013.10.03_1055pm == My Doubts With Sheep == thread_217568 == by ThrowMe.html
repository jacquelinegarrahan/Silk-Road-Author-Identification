				OK guys, since SR went down we&#039;re all looking for a new home. The two obvious options are Sheep Marketplace and BMR.<br /><br />Most of you have been attracted to sheep because of the clean UI and fast servers. With all kind of 3 letter agencies targeting hidden marketplaces like this UI should be at the back of the priority list for users.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s just me, but Sheep just doesn&#039;t appear ready or secure enough. If LE target Sheep like they did SR I bet Sheep wouldn&#039;t last a month.<br /><br />The communication from the owners is terrible! Look at all the issues people are having on the forum and they&#039;re receiving no replies.<br /><br />The admins are stupid enough to have a clearnet version of the site http://sheepmarketplace.com/<br /><br />The domain has an email address linked to it, and the server is only hidden behind cloudflare, a simple Warrant forces cloudflare to reveal the servers real location, hopefully that server isn&#039;t used to host the actual marketplace, but regardless there will be traces of the admins identity left behind on that server, or in the payment for that server. (and if law enforcement gain access to the server they could inject could into the browsers of users to reveal users real ip addresses)<br /><br />TLDR;<br />The admins of this site just don&#039;t seem to have the skillset required to take on such a large operation. BMR looks like a much better option at this moment in time.<br />

				They gotta get rid of that clearnet bullshit, but other than that, I know how everybody loved SR, and nothing can live up to it, only a better version, but until that better version comes along, best choices are SM, and BMR just until now, just to keep everybody satisfied, vendors, and customers. Last but not least is trust, bcuz you see where trust got DPR Everybody should be uneasy, business, nothing personal, good counter hackers, and better servers locations will be key.

				And it gets worse, I initially made an error when browsing dns records. The clearnet website isn&#039;t even hidden behind cloudflare, it runs directly from the servers ip address.<br /><br />And to make it worse they share the server with other websites, for those of you who don&#039;t know much about security, that makes it much easier to hack, all an attacker has to do is find a vulnerability in one of the websites and he compromises them all, including sheepmarketplace.com

				I was just browsing this board and come across this thread. I don&#039;t see any mention of Deepbay, has anybody heard of it or used it? The site URL is:<br /><br />http://deepbay4xr3sw2va.onion<br /><br />Looks like a deepnet version of eBay, hence the name. Have not investigated it other than look at what was on offer.<br />If anyone knows anything about it, be grateful if they could share it.<br />Or if you are adventurous, see what you think and report back.<br />Thanks people and Good Luck :)

				lots of goodness itt, needs a bump... people need to get over their worst panic and &quot;need my fix now&quot; feelings, clearly a mass of sheep (trollolol) are just flocking towards there now - who the f knows how many days or weeks or months until LE does another crackdown, especially if the security is non-existent. created acc&#039;s to both, just to check how they look and feel like... and I aint no IT specialist, SM looks a bit too much like a site for an ice cream vendor. maybe that&#039;s a good thing...? <br /><br />&quot;drugs&quot; category had like 450 entries 48+ hrs ago, now over 1600... can they handle this kind of growth? is it a &quot;safe&quot; option to buy anything from? etc etc. <br /><br />gj ThrowMe, I would + you if I knew how it&#039;s done... :)

				I hate stupid people.<br /><br />You&#039;ve basically just said &quot;ohh noez! You can reach silk road on the clearnet at a .onion.to address! We better abandon silk road because its running on a server with lots of other websites&quot;<br /><br />Until you have actual knowledge about the real implementation, I&#039;d stfu.<br /><br />Since too many vendors know who I am, I certainly can&#039;t brag about some alternative to the sites mentioned which I have created--DPR showed us what that&#039;ll get you--but you can rest assured that none of these sites will last unless they can post proof that they are safer than SR was.<br /><br />I&#039;ve given it some thought, and I believe I can create a network of hidden services that would make the military envious. I&#039;d foreshadow, but then someone would later come back and say &quot;laser secuiry?!?! That must be JJ!&quot;

				Sheep market is a bad joke, BMR is more like a not funny joke and SR was a perfect beautiful joke. if must then BMR and cmn guys &quot;Sheep Market&quot; like really, what meat do you think they are selling there ? Hope there will be soon lot of new good BMs with rep building and escrow.
