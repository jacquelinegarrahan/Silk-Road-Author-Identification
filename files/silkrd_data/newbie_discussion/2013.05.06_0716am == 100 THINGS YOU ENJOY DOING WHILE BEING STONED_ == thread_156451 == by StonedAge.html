				watching documentaries with the sound off and other music playing<br />rolling joints<br />using weed as a tool to try and learn more about myself and the world and come to terms with my life and situation (not too much though :P)<br /><br />I find weed to be an enhancer of the emotion and wishes at the time, so that being said i enjoy everything that i want to enjoy when I smoke. From listening to music, to doing Yoga, trying to Paint (even though I do not know how). To sum up I like learning new things, explore myself and surrounding world, or sometimes just relax...that is needed too :D

				If i&#039;m home i will most certainly rinse my face with water/wash my teeth.<br />Cycling is really intense (ONLY for those who can handle it!)(Safety first).<br />Talk about things. Come up with great ideas. Write them down.<br />WRITE THEM DOWN! Can&#039;t stretch this enough. <br />This will improve your &quot;high memory&quot; and imo is part of truly enjoying/understanding weed in general. Don&#039;t just black out and eat all the time...

				Eat. Everything tastes so fucking good. I&#039;ll switch between chocolate, pringles, pizza, energy drinks, in the space a few minutes.<br /><br />Music. Winamp + milkdrop visualization is extremely trippy on fullscreen, highly recommended. Infected Mushroom is always good. Global Communication to chill out.<br /><br />Games. Played through entire Bioshock Infinte stoned as fuck. Mind blown. Borderlands 1 and 2&#039;s cartoony look is spectacular while stoned, and there&#039;s always a few rounds of BF3 online. Even when fucked up enough to hallucinate I seem to do slightly better than sober.<br /><br />Movies and tv. Cartoons man. Adventure Time is a must. Also anything with a lot of special effects. I thought Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was amazing, so I must have been super stoned. Cloud Atlas even made sense and blew my mind, and I cried like a baby at the end.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Also porn, jesus christ.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />But one of the best feeling is probably a few hours in when it starts to wear off, and you realize you still have 3/4ths left of your joint, so you have many hours left of being stoned as fucking hell, fuuuck yeaaaah.
