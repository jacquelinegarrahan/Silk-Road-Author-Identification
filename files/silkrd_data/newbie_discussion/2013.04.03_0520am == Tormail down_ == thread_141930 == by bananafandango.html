				Title: <strong>Tormail down?</strong><br />

				Hello all!<br /><br />Thank you for your comments in advance. I created an account here and with tormail a couple of weeks ago. So far, I haven&#039;t really done anything except to create accounts and do some browsing. I have set up btc accounts, as well. All of this has been anonymous. <br /><br />Today Tormail is not allowing me to login. This is the first time this has happened. When I click login, it takes me to the option of Roundcube, Control Panel, or Squirrel. Then, when I click either Roundcube or Squirrel, it reads, &quot;Database Error! Contact your server administrator.&quot; I&#039;ve tried the HELP button without success. It just takes me to a page that tells me to download Thunderbird and configure it for Tormail (which I did). That did not work, either. In fact, when I was configuring T-bird, it kept telling me that my password or email address was incorrect (it was not--I retyped it many times to be sure). <br /><br />Am I screwed here? Did I fall for some kind of phishing scam with the whole Thunderbird thing? Has my account been compromised? Anyone else have this happen? What do y&#039;all think?<br /><br />Thanks again for your thoughts on this.

				Tormail is down more than it is up the last 3 days or so.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t there be at least one other Tor-based email provider?&nbsp; I would pay for good email.

				Thanks, you guys. I suppose being a noob brings a generous helping of nerves about anything that seems amiss. Or perhaps I&#039;m&nbsp; just being smart. I&#039;m glad it&#039;s not only me.

It isn&#039;t easy running a site on the deepweb even without having to hide the Incoming and Outgoing mail servers too. I am sure it will be working again in due time.
