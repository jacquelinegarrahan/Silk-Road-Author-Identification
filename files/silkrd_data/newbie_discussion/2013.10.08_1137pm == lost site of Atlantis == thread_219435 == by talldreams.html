				I&#039;m sure they knew that they were the next target. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they are closed for good to avoid prison,&nbsp; or if they have any intention of beefing security up then reopening... <br /><br /><br />

				seen an article with a quote from the so called founder of atlantis. all he stated was that he was surprised that ulbricht was the founder of SR&nbsp; and how surprised he is of how these young brilliant minds r willing to throw away a bright future to give certain freedoms back that the government has taken away.<br /><br />doesnt seem to me like he&nbsp; knew anything..i think all markets would have eventually closed except SR if it would have stayed active. The &quot;Amazon for drugs&quot;

				Nancy&#039;s &#039;war on drugs&#039; has cost the lives and freedoms of millions and set back social evolution by unimaginable amounts. I know I&#039;m preaching to the choir here but if I can get through to just one LE to think on the events of the past few years. the cat and mouse game began almost immediately. 1.2 billion in sales, not all illegal. not all hurting anyone other than the occasional injury to the user, or vendor/user getting scammed. nothing compared to the damage done by tobacco and alcohol and perhaps firearms but that&#039;s a whole other debate. my point is the cartels do not need to exist, the violence does not need to exist, the sick financial gain by cartels, LE, prisons,politicians, countries and corporations who&#039;s need for the staus quo to remain unchanged. so there it is. you&#039;ve heard this before. there&#039;s even movements within the LE community to rid the archaic system of this evil. all that is, and all that will be will come forth from the seeds that were planted here. we can debate what&#039;s right and what&#039;s wrong but in the end it&#039;s about power and it&#039;s about money. true enlightenment comes for most with those last 3 breaths and then the overwhelming sense of peace and love as you return to god or whatever you believe in. Each of us in this community will be affected by these events differently. but the thoughts of a bunch of LE feeling like they won some big battle is vein and self serving. you haven&#039;t won. you&#039;ve lost. we will prevail in the end and you will reach enlightenment.
