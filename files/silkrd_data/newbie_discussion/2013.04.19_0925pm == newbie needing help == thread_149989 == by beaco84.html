				Most ppl. buy bitcoins through https://mtgox.com/<br />Tjeck it out. Loads of tutorials on &quot;how to&quot;<br /><br />But... Your transaction will likely take up to 5 days. A better option (For smaller transactions IMHO) Is to find a national bitcoin trader. <br />For instance: If you are from Scandinavia many ppl. use https://bitcoinnordic.com/index_da.html<br />Much easier transfer for you (No need for pasport and so on) And you have you bitcoins within hours normaly. Bitcoins at nationat traders are as to be expected a little more expensive. But well worth it for a first timer.<br /><br />Now you just need to find a national BC trader for whereever you are from.

				BTC buying got MUCH easier for me when I started using localbitcoins or bitcoinslocal..something like that..pretty cool, kind of like a craigslist thing for doing personal trades. Maybe not for everyone but I will NEVER use those &quot;services&quot; again, not stable..lost lots of my $ waiting when BTCs were fluctuating so wildly plus after all is said and done, you are STILL paying 8-10%+!<br />maybe it&#039;s easier for me because I live in a big city<br />&nbsp;Hope this helps in some way :)<br />~PB2k

				first and foremost do not access mt.gox via tor browser only thru your regular browser.<br />1. go to mt.gox.com. make sure there is a green bar area in the address when you get there. <br />2. sign up for an account per mt. gox directions.<br />3. get and write down all passwords and screen names. dont forget them.<br />4. go to bit instant.com and follow directions there to put BTC onto your mt.gox account. <br />5. once you have gone thru the process and paid your amount you want at the appropriate establishment it will take about an hour to get to your mt gox account. <br />6. now that you have money on your mt. gox account oyu can buy BTC at their present price or you make a bid of your own and it may be accepted. otherwise your order for BTC is immediate and will your account money will change upon reload of screen from USD to BTC.<br />7. go to the &quot;withdraw funds&quot; on home page at mt. gox and select bitcoin in the drop down menu. enter your full amount you wish to transfer in the appropriate area. all the way to the last 0.<br />8. minimize your this regular browser. and leave it.<br />9. start tor and go to silkroad or have it open already. go to your account. close to the top. click on deposit.<br />10. copy that long screwy number by right highlighting it and rt click to copy.<br />11. minimize this browser.<br />12. you should have both browsers up and running at once right now.<br />13. go back to your mt gox page and paste the the newly copied number into the bitcoin address window under where you put in the amount you wanted to transfer.<br />14. click send funds&nbsp; &nbsp;that should do it.&nbsp; this whole process takes some time so be patient took me about a day.
