				Depends if they vacuumed sealed&nbsp; more then one time/Mylar packaging,Heat packaging etc..&nbsp; I ordered 2 packages the 22nd and around here its 98-100 degrees :/ so they probably wont last more then 10 days?

				Do you know what kind of packaging was used? MBB will last way longer than regular vac seal. 3m 3700 MBB bags double bagged might never leak.

				2-3 DAYS VACUUM SEALED,&nbsp; It wont stink but you can tell that it has decompressed. If you do it 4xtimes though it will last for 8-12 days depending.

				I&#039;ve stored quantity vacuumed sealed for up to a month, without any smell issue. So I wouldn&#039;t worry about the mailman.&nbsp; However, dogs are an entirely different story, I believe it takes less then 10 minutes for a dog to detect through a vacuum sealed bag<br />
