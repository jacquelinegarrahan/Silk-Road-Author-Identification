				So I used silkroad a good bit in the fall of 2011 and the spring of 2012, but I&#039;ve been away for awhile and coming back there&#039;s been some changes and I was hoping someone could catch me up to speed. <br /><br />The first thing (and this took me like 30 minutes to figure out) is that newbies are not allowed to post outside of the newbie thread. I imagine that&#039;s to keep the signal to noise ratio good, and it&#039;s understandable, but can someone explain to me how the system works specifically? In order to not be a newbie do you have to pass a... test or something? Or do I just got to post enough on the newbie forum to get my forum post count up high enough?<br /><br />Also I have some specific security questions on the changes that have happened to bitcoin in the last year, but more of that later. <br /><br />Thanks!

				I might not be able to be as specific as you&#039;d like, but as I understand it you just need 50 posts here in the newbie section and then you are free to post whatever on the forums.&nbsp; No test or anything like that&nbsp; :D.&nbsp; What&#039;s odd to be but I never really questioned it was I was active back when they first came out with the 50 post limit thing (I think it was sometime around Jan or Feb that this started) and I spammed my way to 50 posts.&nbsp; But I took a couple months off and I came back and I was back down to zero posts lol.&nbsp; So this time I&#039;m not messing around with spam and I&#039;m actually trying to contribute.&nbsp;

				Cool. I&#039;ll post around and see if I can push up my post count high enough. <br /><br />The security thing I have a question about: <br /><br />I was just going to post this in the Security forum but since I can&#039;t, I&#039;ll post it here and maybe get my post count up a little higher. <br /><br />I used to use MtGox but now they require verification to do anything with fiat currency. How badly does this hurt the security of MtGox? Should I switch to a different service?<br /><br />I have a bunch of coins left over in my MtGox wallet that I sold for money, and to transfer it out, I&#039;ve got to get verified. If I get verified, does that put me at risk, even though it&#039;s been over a year since I bought anything?<br /><br />*ALSO*<br />In general what&#039;s changed in the security landscape for bitcoin and silk road? Have things gotten dicier, or has SR proven itself to be a bastion against the legal forces? (or something in between. Shades of gray are encouraged) I&#039;m back to SR because it&#039;s my only source now, and I just want to make sure I don&#039;t do anything that will result in legal problems for me. I&#039;m just a weekend tripper who doesn&#039;t want to bother anybody or be bothered by anybody. I do my drugs alone and in private, I&#039;m not hooked up with the local drug scene or the like, so I don&#039;t think I have many security holes that things could get through, but I would hate the idea of cops busting down my door and taking my computer. Especially with the recent NSA stuff.... you know... can&#039;t be too careful.

				That&#039;s a pretty good question, CryptoTree. I wonder if there&#039;s a way to get statistics on the SR without endangering anyone, as I&#039;d like to know the danger level in using SR. Are most of the orders getting through? Is it really secure to just use tor for SR? Is there a special way to do that? I&#039;ve been researching for a while, and I was gonna ask in the security section, but the blasted 50 post requirement makes it really hard for anyone new to join. I&#039;m not hear to chit-chat most of the time, when I have a burning question, that&#039;s when I tried to join, but I can&#039;t ask it until I chit-chat or spam my way to 50 I suppose.

				ya its dumb, really dumb<br /><br />you can always punch up security in lots of ways, lot you read up in forums here, bmr, bitcointalk etc.<br /><br />usual vpn socks etc, creating bootable USB OS purely for any deepweb etc etc.

I mean I&#039;ve bought about 16 different times and never been caught. It&#039;s better than anything else on the deep web, and it&#039;s more reliable than street (unless you personally know the dealer. but I&#039;ve been sold some bum &quot;acid&quot; tabs quite a few times). <br /><br />I think some of it&#039;s like flying versus driving. Driving kills more people a year, but when you fly, it&#039;s out of your control. Buying online has a lot of unknowns that makes it hard for us to feel like we&#039;re in control. The thing for me is really understanding the best ways to optimize my online experience. I should probably start using PGP for my messages too. I&#039;m a little too lazy, but I think I&#039;m going to change that.

				I&#039;m thinking about going with the USB. If nothing else, because then it can be detached from the computer and hidden someplace.<br /><br />Is there a reason to go full bootable os though? ya it can be as anything and everything &quot;dark&quot; is hidden. Your PC is perfectly clean and normal..always :).<br /><br />What&#039;s your thoughts on whether or not I should withdraw my money? And isn&#039;t bitcoin untraceable like cash?<br /><br />Depends how much is in there ? I can do all your docs for like 2BTC.....so if there is 50 BTC there well worth it...if there is 1BTC...its not :)

				I can withdraw it no problem if I get verified, I&#039;m just not sure if I should. <br /><br />My thoughts were: Get verified, withdraw cash, get out and start using another service. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t transferred anything to or from that MtGox account for nearly a year, so I think I&#039;m probably safe to do so, yeah?<br /><br />If getting verified is a problem, even just to withdraw, then I&#039;ll probably just buy more coin when the market is low again, and then transfer it over to my SR account or something and spend it on something. No loss there.

				you don&#039;t have to use &quot;your&quot; details to verify ;)<br /><br />Just chuck them some forgeries and get ya coins out.
