				Title: <strong>New Theory</strong><br />

				After just finding out about what happened to the SR network by scrolling through the web, I read some preliminary information and find all of this a bit &quot;odd,&quot; per se.<br /><br />Not only is the watermarked image (and the fact that they&#039;d put an image up anyway instead of just taking down the site) odd to me, apart from all the other oddities pointed out by other users in the regular and newbie forums, but here is what I find interesting and &quot;odd&quot; about it all:<br /><br />LE websites can&#039;t update anything because of the government shutdown and the Anti-deficiency Act which has officials shitting bricks.<br /><br />Although I&#039;m not a proponent of conspiracy theories, I do find all of this (especially the timing of it all) very very odd.<br /><br />IF, and I stress the word &quot;if&quot; here, the theories that this is an elaborate ruse by DPR, then it is by far the most successful trolling trick in the history of the internet. Imagine the scenario: LE Agencies finally update their websites with new information days from now, after all the hype of speculation caused by the &quot;seizure&quot;, and are forced to have a message that says no arrest was made, and then the SR site page is brought back with an updated and more streamlined layout? Yes, it may just be an ideal fantasy, but you never know. It all seems eery to me.<br /><br />Just to reiterate my feelings on this: it&#039;s all a bit odd, especially when you consider the timing of it all.<br /><br />Have a nice day (despite the devastating news),<br /><br />~ ABF<br /><br />PS: The root idea of SR will never be lost. As JFK said so many years ago, &quot;A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.&quot;

				I absolutely agree!<br /><br />I&#039;m not not into conspiracies theories at all, but the minute I saw the seizure image, something just didn&#039;t look right. It was the watermark. Why would the feds use that?!?! It doesn&#039;t look like an official seizure notice.&nbsp; I am not saying that he DPR wasn&#039;t arrested but I don&#039;t think the site was seized. Also if you look at all the mainstream media articles every single one has different details. They clearly do not have a real a story and do not have their facts straight. I never believe what the media say. Its mostly disinformation and they all they care about is viewership and readership. The story could have easily been planted to one major news outlet and then spread like wildfire given that the site has the seizure notice, which makes it believable. I had 2 theories based on all of this before I read yours. Either DPR knew they were coming and made the site completely inaccessible, like a killswitch. I also think the watermark was deliberately placed there as a cryptic message to all of us but we&#039;re not seeing it for what it really means. Or the other theory like you said, he just got away with the most successful scam in the history of the internet.&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re not in denial. We&#039;re looking at the bigger picture instead of buying into what we&#039;re spoon fed.
