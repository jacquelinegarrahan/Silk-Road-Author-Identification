				seems like all you can do is hope that the buyer comes back to finalize while waiting for autofinalize.<br />

				You&#039;ve held up your end. I&#039;d just wait to see if they get back to you and go from there.<br />Worst case scenario you&#039;ve got to wait until it auto-finalises to get your coins.

				I have twice had the mailman ring my doorbell to hand over express package to me(but there was no signature required). The vendor clearly had the signature required option voided, but the mail man obviously just wanted to make sure i received the package in person. Needless to say, it spooked the shit out of me when i looked through the keyhole and saw him standing there the first time with my package in his hands! The other express deliveries have just been put in mailbox with regular mail. Maybe got that same knock on the door and it spooked him out completely? Should also mention the second time it happened to me it was a maillady i hadn&#039;t seen on my route before. I didn&#039;t answer the door on that one, and even though there was no signature required marked on the package she kept it and left a slip in the mailbox stating that it would be attempted to deliver the next day. After contacting the vendor to confirm the no signature required i just took a gamble and went down to the local post office later on that same day and picked it up. Looking back, it was okay, because i now know it wasn&#039;t a controlled delivery. This is just one possible explanation. Also, whether a signature required is voided by vendor or not usps policy states that is at the mailman&#039;s discretion on whether or not to make sure he/she physically handles the express package over, or leaves it at doorstep or in mailbox. Hope this helps.

				Could it be that the express package took too long to arrive and they&#039;ve gone off on holiday?
