				Well call me old fashioned but I always felt that there is nothing more fun than good discussion!<br />All this spamming to fifty posts makes me a bit sad as I am sure if people just bothered to say something of interest and start a decent thread they would hit the fifty post mark in no time. Am I just being weird?!?

				I totally agree with the idea of having a conversation, the problem is that I feel like having a conversation in the newbie area is less likely to be productive and more likely to get lost and not contribute to anything.

				I am trying to make an even balance of proper posts and &#039;bump&#039; posts in order to reach 50. I desperately want to post in the Australian forum, which I am unable to do so until I get to 50.... hence the spam post. <br /><br />HOWEVER - I am more than happy to also have a discussion / conversation! :) The last country I visited for holidays was Hong Kong - the tall buildings freaked me out, I loved Disney land (very cute and based on how walt originally planned the theme park) and I overspent in the markets there!! How about you - what was the last country you visited? <br /><br />

				So three priests and their wives are flying back from an interdenominational conference when the plane crashes and they all die.<br /><br />They all arrive at the pearly gates at the same time.<br /><br />St. Peter says to the first priest, &quot;I am sorry, but I cannot let you in. You adored sugar and sweets. You had the biggest sweet tooth, and was so involved with sugar and sweets that you married a woman named Candy.&quot; Off they go to hell.<br /><br />St. Peter then addresses the second priest, &quot;I am sorry but I cannot let you in. You truly did not love the Lord, you only loved money. In fact, you loved it so much that you married a woman named Penny.&quot; Off they go to hell.<br /><br />The third priest says to his wife, &quot;Fanny, we don&#039;t have a chance.&quot;

				I agree that actual convos are pretty great. I just want to get to 50 so I can post reviews, so I&#039;ve done a few spam posts. I&#039;m tired of looking for vendors and finding nothing (not nothing current). I figure I might as well share the experience with other people who may want to purchase from the same people,&nbsp; but aren&#039;t sure if it&#039;s worth it.
