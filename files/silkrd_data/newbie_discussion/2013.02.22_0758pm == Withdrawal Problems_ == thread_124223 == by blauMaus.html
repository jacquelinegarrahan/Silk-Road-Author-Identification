				Most withdrawals dont take that long, however, I have had some withdrawals take 5-8 hours before seeing them in the blockchain.&nbsp; <br /><br />If i were you, i would wait a couple more hours and if you still dont see them, message support and they will help you out :)

				I found this on the help page:<br /><br />&quot;Withdrawals are currently delayed up to 15 hours. All withdrawals should be caught up in the next few hours. &quot;<br /><br />So i will wait some more and then contact the support.

				I made a withdrawal last night and was surprised when it took about an hour to show on blockchain.&nbsp; lol.<br /><br />It&#039;s safe to say things are moving a bit slowly right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />My suggestion would be to wait a few more hours before contacting support ... and if it still doesn&#039;t show up, then go ahead and send support a message so they can check it out and push it through manually, if necessary.

				Is anyone else having issues with withdrawing?<br /><br />Conspiracy theory: The message on the help page is only displayed to users whose transaction got flagged an will be checked by the team

				lol ... no, your conspiracy theory isn&#039;t correct because i got the message last night and never even reported that things were slow.&nbsp; <br /><br />everything will be okay --- no need to pull out the tinfoil hats.&nbsp; :D
