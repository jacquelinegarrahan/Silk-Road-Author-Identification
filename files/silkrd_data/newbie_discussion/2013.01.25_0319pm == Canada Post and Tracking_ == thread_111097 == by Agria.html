				So last Sunday I ordered 0.5g of cocaine from a domestic vendor. It was shipped within one day and I got the tracking number on Tuesday. Everything was fine until yesterday (Thursday) when the information on the Canada Post website said it was delivered, but I never actually got anything. I&#039;m thinking that the mail carrier may have accidentally put it in the wrong box (I get my mail from a community box) and one of my neighbors got it. I&#039;m just wondering if I call Canada Post and try to investigate, am I admitting guilt? And if one of my neighbors opens it and calls LE, would that be admissible in court? I don&#039;t even care if I don&#039;t actually get it I just don&#039;t want to get in trouble!<br /><br />Anyone have any advice?<br /><br />

				Canadian vendor here.&nbsp; No expert.<br /><br />If it was marked as delivered then someone actually delivered it and scanned the bar code on it to mark it as delivered.&nbsp; Most likely wrong box.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; Someone else shouldn&#039;t open it if its got your name on it.&nbsp; That&#039;s just wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d wait for it to come to you from a neighbor.&nbsp; Deny everything and play dumb if it goes bad.&nbsp; Keep a tidy house and you will be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be strange if they did&#039;t come and bring it to you as a neighbor.&nbsp; Stealing the parcel is pretty obvious in this case .&nbsp; Most nighbors are nice to each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;Calling for it is bad.&nbsp; Also, sometimes tracking could be from a similar order and a scam, but I doubt it.&nbsp; Not for that amount. <br /><br />You really need to straighten out your mail delivery.&nbsp; It&#039;s sounds risky and sketchy.&nbsp; You can buy mail boxes at your local post office.&nbsp; It&#039;s more secure having your mail delivered there instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;At least it&#039;s locked up.

				You are thinking about the store.&nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly you don&#039;t live in Canada haha , lucky you. It&#039;s still Wintery here .&#039; Late spring. <br /><br />We don&#039;t have cameras on our mailboxes here.&nbsp; They are outside in the cold.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not a PO box at a store .&nbsp; It&#039;s an alternate mail address so he can get mail without his neighbors stealing his his mail or getting is mixed up. <br /><br />He needs a different mail address that is locked up and simple for the mentally challenged mailman to get it right. <br />&nbsp;.&nbsp; .&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; How about, get a new mail address. That is a simpler answer than explaining everything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your pack was delivered is what I&#039;m saying.&nbsp; They don&#039;t scan bar codes out of thin air.&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone scanned it before delivery, probably thinking it was the right mailbox.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here in Canada , it&#039;s not unusual to find your mail at your neighbors house, on the ground, in the ditch, in a bears mouth - running down the road.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve seen it all .&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t ship edibles to rural addresses. Animals will attack the mailbox. Hehe.&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny with hash brownies I bet .<br /><br />Also, in rural Canada , anyone can open your mailbox at the end of the driveway. It&#039;s just a wooden box or whatever.&nbsp; So, if someone knows or sees a parcel, it&#039;s a tempting thought to sneak over and snatch it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had my mail delivered by children for a week, as the mailman was off sick. Haha he got his kids to do. His route.&nbsp; How&#039;s that for small town shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;So yes,&nbsp; my confidence in the mail is shaken. <br /><br />I hope is goes good for you&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure it will turn up.&nbsp; Nobody will open it unless they plan to steal it. In that case they won&#039;t call the cops.

				Yep what Northstars said! Also if your neighbor did open your mail i highly doubt they would call LE as it is illegal to open someone&#039;s mail in Canada(just like everywhere else)<br />I am in a small town in Canada and here we have a post office and right beside it there is all the mail boxes in a seperate room so everyone has there own box.You can also be sent something general delivery in which case you can just ask at post office if they have anything(may ask for id).What the OP is talking about in Canada all through rural areas are big boxes with like 30-100 little boxes where the mail man delivers mail.I maybe wrong but that is what i got from it.
