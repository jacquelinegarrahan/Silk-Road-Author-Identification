				I IV probably four to five times a day, and seeking out and finding veins at this point is becoming a pain. I am trying to find something similar to http://nursinglink.monster.com/nfs/nursinglink/attachment_images/0018/7506/iStock_000004202079XSmall_crop380w.jpg?1300316574 , put it in first thing in the morning and use it all day long like they do in the hospital. If anyone know where to find something like this I&#039;d be really interested (or if someone sold them on SR I&#039;d be happy to buy them). Anyways, thought I&#039;d ask (and since I&#039;m limited to Newbie section I am posting it here, I&#039;ll repost when I hit 50 in vendor request).<br /><br />Also, if anyone has hints and tips on finding veins in fattier (not super fatty, but not muscular) arms I&#039;d be interested. I can not find any veins on my left arm and my right arm and hands are pretty much out of veins from years of use.

				hard not to be a condescending cunt saying this but have you thought about getting treatment? that or make friends with someone who works in a pharmacy or even a hospital porter could possibly get their hands on some. how about the between the toe thing? my knowledge on IV is coming purely from fictional tv shows here so if i&#039;m chatting shit just ignore.

				Not saying getting treatment wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea, and I really want to get off the drugs, but being at home 24x7 (which turns you into a hermit) makes life just a little bit more bearable. But let&#039;s not digress this conversation into &quot;you should quit doing heroin&quot; conversation (because I agree, though I do H for recreational purposes, I also do it because it&#039;s the absolute best pain killer on the market compared to Oxy, Hydromorphone (D&#039;s), Morphine, Opana, etc).&nbsp; And let&#039;s keep it on the finding the item, in reply to friend at a hospital, sadly I don&#039;t. I do not come off as the kind of person you would ask to roll of up his sleeves on. <br /><br />I tried for awhile switching to snorting, but I&#039;d honestly rather just eat pills than snort them or H, I snorted a whole gram of H over 3 hours and didn&#039;t get high at all. But IV 100mg&#039;s and that last&#039;s like 4 hours and brings a little smile to my face.

				Keep a close look on VP (Vein Preservation), it´s no good that your arms and hands are messed up.<br />Check out &quot;drugs-forum&quot; there are some really good info that could come in handy. <br />(not saying that you don´t know your shit but it´s always better to know everybody´s shit before ending up in you own) <br /><br /><br />Btw... Plugging is out of the question?

				Yeah tried plugging several times, unless I recently went poo it was completely ineffective. If only I could get my bowels to actually work I&#039;d be all over plugging over IV (same effect, longer lasting when it work, and you don&#039;t lose your asshole like you lose a vein...)

				i just had a chat with a friend who works in a hospital and if it&#039;s cannulas you&#039;re after then they&#039;re not even controlled in the pharmacy, they&#039;ll have them in normal supply rooms with gauze and shit. a nurse or hca could lift a few without anyone noticing. have you tried a needle exchange place for harm reduction, they should be able to help you out and provide some support. he also mentioned that your vein can collapse whilst having the cannula in so that&#039;s something to think about... have you looked on the clearweb at all? you can get medical supplies and generic pharmaceuticals pretty cheap overseas just do the research on their legitimacy first of course
