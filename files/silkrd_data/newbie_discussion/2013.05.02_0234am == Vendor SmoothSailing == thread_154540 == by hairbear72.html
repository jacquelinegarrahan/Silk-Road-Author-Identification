				Yeah mate. We FE too, as per sellers request. He was quick to respond to any questions prior to FE, however he has not replied to our queries as to the whereabouts of the goods since. That was 9 days ago.<br />Will be notifying SR and changing feedback.<br />Its all pointing towards a scam.

				Same here! gave him the benefit of the doubt with the public holidays etc however its been about 10 days now...<br /><br />Some people appear to be getting what they ordered, however a lot of these are being updated very quickly (perhaps too quickly), he might buy his product with other usernames to record positive feedback to keep us idiots rolling in with FE&#039;s<br /><br />Honestly, I knew I was taking a risk in the first place (lesson learned). 2/3 of my first orders received so happy with other vendors I have dealt with. this guy is either a clever scammer or an unorganised paranoid junkie. I suggest people start updating their feedback to save others from getting caught, mine has been over run with other peoples FE&#039;s and most likely lost on page 6 or so <br /><br />

				Well if it gives you guys some peace of mind I&#039;ve ordered off him 6 times before, all next day delivery, top notch buds too.<br /><br />But yeah,, when SR came back up I went looking straight away to get some ganja, I noticed he lowered his prices - they were cheap before but not that cheap - and requiring FE for absolutely no fuckin&#039; reason at all rang alarm bells.<br /><br />Looks like ETM the second, made his prices the cheapest so he could pull in more suckers before he did a runner. Someone&nbsp; should put this in the Australian thread

				Very sorry to here that dude, just 3 points for me and I knew the risk was there. He&#039;s feedback and story was a little sketchy to say the least, definitely would not have trusted him with a few laca. Not worth the risk, doing a few hundred cold is enough of a lesson for me.<br /><br />I would have like to put this in the Australian Thread and much sooner but it wont let me post, does it not allow new users or is there some other reason?? Wanted to warn people ages ago but with SR down, and not being able to post it just wasn&#039;t possible. Hoping people check him out here before committing, his feedback is actually improving with all these FE&#039;s...damn<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154540.msg1078968#msg1078968">Quote from: Tommy Vercetti on May 02, 2013, 06:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yep, same here....<br />I&#039;ve been hit hard by this (possible) scam, to the tune of $2150.<br />I&#039;m so, so gutted.<br />That money meant a lot to me...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Also, just noticed all his listings are gone and when I click on his name it only takes me to my messages that I&#039;ve sen him...<br /><br />So either SR have deleted his account or he&#039;s closed it (if that&#039;s possible).<br /><br />Either way, not looking very promising for us at this stage.<br />This has completely dirtied my view on FE, despite having 100% past success any time doing it :(

				Yep, something has happened to his account but I had already written off receiving anything or getting a refund...<br /><br />Unfortunately with his success I would bet he will be back under some other username, best people be very careful from now on. If it&#039;s too good to be true, it most like is! Lucky I spread out my orders to suss out different vendors. At least now I know some good ones now...

Do not treat this site as a &quot;cheap&quot; method of getting gear, you get what you pay for and in some cases that will be nothing! If you use it to get better quality gear at around street prices and even a little below, I am confident you will achieve your goals.<br /><br />And if that isn&#039;t how you want to roll, at least recognise you are gambling with the money you are FE&#039;ing...

				&nbsp;I posted a warning in the forums about this guy a few weeks ago.&nbsp; His whole operation just reeked of SCAM.

				I&#039;ve said it once , I&#039;ll say it again never FE unless it for a trusted seller or its your first couple of buys and the vendor asks you to , and it that case make sure you go with a reputed vendor ok.<br /><br />I&#039;m really sorry to hear that he scammed a lot of people...I can kinda understand why , there wasn&#039;t a lot of gear goin around last week and his prices weren&#039;t too bad , there wasn&#039;t much to choose from.<br />BUT...you only had to look at his feedback and people weren&#039;t updating their feedback after 2-3 days , that tells me that they haven&#039;t received their orders.<br /><br />Any feedback that said that they had received was either Smoothsailing posing as customer or he did send some orders just to lend validity to the scam. <br /><br />I&#039;m maybe a little older than some of you guys , coming up to the big 40 soon , and I dont mean to sound like I know it all , but just be a little more careful ok. I it looks dodgy it probably is. If your unsure about the vendor read the feedback and search the forums.<br /><br />Stay safe and get high !!!<br /><br />Oh and Smoothsailing , I know you will read this , Karma is coming to get you...

The fact his rating was 86, he had feedback stating previous deliveries had not made it and selling ounces of Medical Grade weed for $300 an ounce -&nbsp; $100 cheaper than any reputable vendor and using a generic photo taken from google non the less... Anyone those that FE take it as a lesson to be learn when using Silk Road as you have lost your money this time. In future, always check the forums before ordering and if you are unsure just ask as many users here have seen many scams on Silk Road so know the the tell tale signs...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On top of that. I would also recommend never buying from any vendor with a feedback rating lower than 98, with only a few exceptions. They have low feedback for a reason and it&#039;s not for delivering quality product :P<br /><br />I was amazed, there was this guy called MrNizeGuy007 selling a bunch of different things. He has an 86 rating people are still ordering from him! I looked at his feedback thread to see why he had such low feedback, and one person even said they had ordered some shrooms, and the package was weeks late or something. On top of that, it wasn&#039;t even what he ordered, it was like half the shrooms and couple buds of blueberry kush, and the guy said the box reeked when he picked it up. Why would you want to take that chance?<br /><br />Amazingly, people are still ordering from him!<br /><br />His most recent low feedback the last time I had checked was for selling fake hydrocodone as that&#039;s what I was looking to buy. It looks like he delivers perfectly for some people, and completely fucks over the other person (maybe he uses the drugs instead of sells them sometimes, but still wants the money so he rips people off every time that happens). I would never deal with that guy, it&#039;s like playing russian roulette.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed that people are still ordering off him, if I was that guy I would of already created a new account to try to salvage any last reputation I had.<br /><br />Who knows, he might already have another account and just uses that one as an alternate account to rip people off with to gain more money. Either way, I could come up with tons of ways ordering from somebody with low feedback would a bad choice, it&#039;s just not a good idea at all. Period.
