				I had a bunch of coins on my account from like 1.5ish years ago. I totally forgot about them and now they are around $3,500.<br /><br />Would I be able to cash these out from my mtgox account w/o causing suspicion? <br /><br />Thanks for the heads up. I dont come to the forums very often.<br /><br />:)

				I wasnt selling anything. <br /><br />I have the emails I got from bit instant about how much money I sent them to get the coins. But the only thing is that I used a fake name with bit instant. I heard thats the best option when adding funds into your account. Although the bit instant stuff was sent to my email address.

I am in the process of being verified. I just dont want to cash out, and then get a knock on my door saying that the funds came from SR. Even though I have never sold anything on SR, is it illegal to have funds coming out of SR to mtgox then to my bank account? Is that even someone they will look for with a $3,500 withdraw? <br />I just dont want anything unexpected to happen.

				Technically all you&#039;ve done is future&#039;s investing. Which is completely legal, and what investment bankers and the like do :) hypothetically they could have a list of silkroad bitcoin addys, I am skeptical though. If you are really worried there are tumbling services (bitcoin fog) that will future confuse things. :)<br /><br />the thing I&#039;d be most worried about is the IRS saying &quot;hey where did this money come from and why haven&#039;t you paid&nbsp; taxes on it?&quot; which if you are super worried about you can fill out the proper forums and pay taxes on it come next tax season.<br /><br />It may not even come up at all. $3500 isn&#039;t a huge amount unless your clearnet income is super low :P<br /><br />good luck! ;)
