				I usually ask the vendor if the photo is up to date, but sometimes they say it is then I get A different product than whats pictured without an explanation. It&#039;s not A big deal most of the time but It is A question of honesty. The reason I brought this up is while searching through the ecstasy listings I noticed two different vendors with the exact same photo for two different products. The vendors Fantastictimes and chemical brothers are using the same picture, chem bro is selling it as MDMA while fantastic is methylone. There is no explanation on their vendor page or the ad itself. the only difference in the pics is fantastic has the letters FT superimposed on it. I am not trying to slam these vendors just wondering what the family thinks about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I would say thats a pretty dishonest way of doing business, its not like we&#039;re selling stereo&#039;s here. I would just avoid them entirely and point it out on their vendor threads.

				2 pictures with claims of it being a different product is pretty big...I would research those sellers pretty thoroughly before buying something.<br />I don&#039;t like stock photos but I don&#039;t mind them as long as product comes in and looks similar.

				I don&#039;t show a photo of my MDMA, largely because I have to crush it anyway before it goes in the capsules and at that point it&#039;s basically just a slightly off-white powder...

				As long as the product is of a same / similar quality to that in the picture and description then I&#039;m not too bothered. I&#039;ve ordered MDMA off the same sellers and it can be different every time. Sometimes white, sometimes tan, large crystals, small crystals, powder etc. Often the seller might have more than one of these forms of MDMA in stock. Are they supposed to have multiple listings with different pictures each time or something? Unless it&#039;s somebody trying to scam you by sending an inferior product as to the one pictured then I think you&#039;re being a bit picky.

				This is such a BIG pet peeve! How are you going to sell me something when I can&#039;t even see the product? You are not just selling drugs, YOU are running a BUSINESS so I demand professionalism.&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t like it at all. Buy from the vendor who posts the actual photograph.. and the guy who doesn&#039;t will realize his sins and compete for your business. It&#039;s the way markets work.
