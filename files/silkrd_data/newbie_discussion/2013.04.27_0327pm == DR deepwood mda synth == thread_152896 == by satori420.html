				Hello,<br />first my english is not the best i hope it is easy to read.<br />i had not many chemical skills but have read in the past a lot and done many rp&amp;i2 synths with pseudoephedrine with success.<br />this is why i think maybe i can make something clearer for yo guys here about he is legit or not.<br />at the second point i must say when a person like dr deepwood that&nbsp; he have high chemical skills*it is true or not*, means that a synth can done from a person with no to low chemical skills ,this means not that it was easy as a cook receipe.<br />every person must learn the basics chemical things but this is what he write in his offer!<br /><br />the third thing when i read about his offer a easy way from safrol to mdma, i think what is the problem of this guy everything about this can be read easy and free available online but the whole thing is safrol is not easy to get and nobody like to order it online.<br />but&nbsp; maybe he have found ways to make this absolutly known synth a little bit more easy for beginners, like a meth synth, this was a big thing&nbsp; for people with low chemical skills&nbsp; that can theire hands on safrol but this was not so much people.<br />ok after i thing about this i like to know is he legid or not i look at his other offer that interesst me more because there was a percussor needed that is not watched. in this offer he means that a have found a way to make mda from the starting percussor helional.<br />i search at google and found a document that means the authorithys found in many busted mdma batches tracks of helional.<br />ok this is a point for him.<br />after that i found a post about that it is absolutly possible but absolutly not easy.<br />ok when i read the offer he write anythink about he update this free available synth at the last step without a acid base ... when this is true the money for the guide is absolutly it worth too.<br />let me clear something at the end of this , i think very hard to read for you thread because of my bad english, when i try to cook meth in the past i start with absolutly nothig to know about chemical things but i read a lot and read and learn and after many trys i had ... no success but then i was lucky a nice member with the name nootropics , i love him, like to send me at a night the complete guide to cook my own meth with all the points that i dont understand before i find him... and whoala the first try with his receipe i had success.<br />this is why i think when dr deepwoods words are true and not more .. nothing about it is easy as cooking potatoes, then this was a big chance for me and many of you and after many reads of his offers it looks like it is.<br />a way from helional to mda is possible that means google too and after i learn something about chemical thinks gassing can replace a acid base but can you leave with a very nasty product hmmm i don=t know is he legid or not but the last point on what i like to write is very important.<br />why is this not found out there for free ... i was at drugs/forum in the past where u can learn how you can cook drugs etc but this is the past nobody like to post ghetto synthesis at open boards at this time every think about the meth ephedrine thing what is happened absolutly hard to get now everywhere and this is why nobody post anything like that on open boards ... maybe this was a good way to bring the righ info to the right persons but who knows ... maybe i need to learn some english insted of chemical thing next time <br />peace
