				As you spend time here, you will likely come across bitcoin scams.&nbsp; In order to help you stay as safe as possible, we thought it would be best to make a thread listing the obvious bitcoin scams &amp; scammer sites.&nbsp; Feel free to post any others you notice.<br /><br />Do not send payments to any of the following sites under any circumstances!<br /><br />SCAM SITES:<br /><br />*** bitswing<br />*** bitcointalks&nbsp; (bitcointalk.org is a legitimate forum, but &quot;bitcointalks.com&quot; is a scam)<br />*** virwex&nbsp; (virwox is/was an exchange, but &quot;virwex&quot; is a scam)<br />*** btkoin<br />*** mtgix<br /><br /><br />Also:<br />1.&nbsp; Never finalize early on the marketplace<br />2.&nbsp; Never send money or bitcoins to someone offering a good or service via PM<br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t fall for it if someone on the forum says that sending them bitcoins is necessary (unless you have placed an order with an official vendor over on the market site, there is no reason you would need to send anyone your bitcoins)<br />4.&nbsp; Always, always stay in escrow!<br />5.&nbsp; Be vigilant &amp; help look out for the rest of the community!<br /><br /><br />** When a deal seems &quot;too good to be true&quot; - there&#039;s a high probability that it is a scam.&nbsp; Be very careful and always make sure that you research vendors/sites before giving them any of your hard-earned money!

				There are lots of really creative scams for Bitcoin. One might think they&#039;d make some cash if they dedicated their efforts at legitimate, if illegal business.

				Excellent points. I notice that on the wiki and to many vendors, an &#039;option&#039; exists for whether or not you want to FE. Ignore this - NEVER FE! It&#039;s a safety feature. I don&#039;t care how much you like this person or how much free stuff that person has given you. There is no such thing as 100% trust here.

				Keep your eye out for the next big one<br /><br />Silk Road reported the greatest scam in its fifteen-month history, which cost the site’s users over a hundred thousand dollars in just two days.<br /><br />Silk Road’s vendors live and die by their reputation and feedback, which buyers give much as they do on eBay.&nbsp; Nobody on Silk Road had a better reputation or more enthusiastic feedback than Tony76, a vendor of heroin, stimulants and psychedelics from Canada.<br /><br />The site has a system of escrow in place – a user places an order, money goes into escrow and the user releases it once the order has been received.&nbsp; Any disputes can be referred to the site’s administrators for resolution.<br /><br />However, ‘trusted vendors’ have always been allowed to request that users ‘finalize early’ – release the funds immediately.&nbsp; New members to the site are often asked to do so until they prove themselves to be ‘trusted buyers’, and sellers will ask for early finalisation when bitcoin – the virtual currency used to trade on the site – is fluctuating wildly.<br /><br />A few days before the great ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’ held on April 20, Tony76 posted in the forums that he was being targeted by a vindictive rival seller who had threatened to set up bogus buyer accounts to order thousands of dollars of drugs in “multiple orders, in multiple names, from multiple states”. Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’<br /><br />So when Silk Road held the ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’, the site’s highest-grossing and most trusted vendor, “Tony76”, jumped on board, offering fabulous discounts on his products and for the first time ever opened up shop to buyers outside North America.&nbsp; Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity.<br /><br />And Tony, sadly, had to ask all buyers to finalize early until he could sort out the situation with the scammer.&nbsp; And of course they did.&nbsp; He was the most highly respected and prolific seller on Silk Road; the buyers had had countless transactions that went smoothly; anyway, to not finalize might mean missing out on a bargain.<br /><br />A week later the rumblings started.&nbsp; The local orders should have arrived by now.&nbsp; Tony wasn’t answering messages.&nbsp; The bespoke site Tony had set up was gone.<br /><br />Two weeks later the rumbles became a roar as it became clear that the most trusted vendor on Silk Road had absconded with what buyers estimated was over a hundred thousand dollars for a single weekend’s work.&nbsp; One moderator of the forums placed it at a cool quarter of a million dollars.<br /><br />There followed much angst and hand-wringing going on at Silk Road.&nbsp; Some believed Tony76 was killed by Mexican drug lords.&nbsp; Others assumed he had been busted. Many refused to believe that someone in their ‘Community’ would do such a thing. Then came the conspiracy theories: he is already selling under another name; Silk Road’s owners are in on it; it’s all part of a worldwide sting and nobody is safe; Tony76 is actually a Canadian bikie gang.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest surprise to take from this is the number of people who are shocked that a drug dealer would rip them off.&nbsp; Silk Road’s advice:&nbsp; never trade outside of escrow.<br /><br />It’s a lesson that will stay with their customers for a long time.

				Wow, a quarter million is a super hard lesson..&nbsp; i feel for everyone.. it was the act of getting burned on some code by my trusted street guy for well over a year that got me searching the web and lead me to here for an alternative.&nbsp; I hope to have much better luck here then on the street.&nbsp; <br /><br />My main concern other then having stuff shipped to my home address and trying to find a po box that will take fake info, is the FE that is required for newbie.&nbsp; Should we just look around until we find someone that will do escrow if they ask us to FE?&nbsp; or are we sorta required to take the change before anyone will trust us?

				Why not use btc-otc? It might be a hassle to figure out, but the web of trust works well. Quick service, decent rates and you can shop around.<br /><br />Make sure your vendor is authorised before you transfer money. If you don&#039;t know what this is, find out. <br /><br />I might write a FAQ if there isn&#039;t one up already.

				If newbie&#039;s do need coins I can garentee https://bitbargain.co.uk/ for user&#039;s living in the Uk and I know Vervox is reputable i&#039;ve used them many time&#039;s to buy other alternate currency&#039;s using a program called second life,but I&#039;m not sure if they still do btc because it wouldn&#039;t suprise me if they thought it was to much hassle because of the Verwex scam but they are reputable if they&#039;re still selling btc.<br />Do a little research if the coin market is at £10 per btc or $15 dollar&#039;s whatever it is your not going to get them for much less there can be a little difference there has to be but in general even buying bulk coin your not going to get massive discounts dont even think your going to get 1200 coins for $800 or whatever i&#039;m pretty sure even as a newbie that they would be running at a loss.<br /><br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)<br />Maybe a sticky with known reputable btc should be made but with no assurances obviously.

				Here in the US, log into blockchain.info, create a temporary wallet, click fund, the site even gives you all the account numbers and info to fill in the next form&gt;&gt;&gt;,&nbsp; just go into a Walmart, get&nbsp; a blue moneygram form, fill in your bogus or real info and the account info from the previous form.&nbsp; Pay the oblivious person your cash, check your online wallet in 3 minutes its funded. Then you can tumble or do what you please like send it to a &quot;real wallet&quot; on your pc or whatever until you are ready to spend it.&nbsp; I dont really get why people need to go for all these bitcoin scams?&nbsp; Is it that they want to save a few bucks?&nbsp; Buyer beware I gess.&nbsp; I just hope the WalMart blue money form thing works in the future, so far no one has ever asked for an ID or anything...Peace.&nbsp;

				In terms of going thru SR members directly for BTC, from my lurking it appears that Blue Sky Traders and CaptainMal (can&#039;t find his name in a search now, may be misspelling or he is no longer active / switched names?) have been reliable.<br /><br />For instance, there is an item open now:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e30e903d1a offering BTC for cash in the mail.&nbsp; One question I have is how does the seller not have a feedback score after their name at all despite all the feedback on the page?&nbsp; Is that indicative that all of the positive feedback is fake and they haven&#039;t actually had any successful trades?<br /><br />TL;DR version:&nbsp; I want to find a balance between low-fee and convenience for potentially large, frequent cash transfers to BTC.&nbsp; If I want to move $1k cash to BTC now and then do so semi-regularly going forward, what&#039;s the best way to get this done yesterday?&nbsp; Bitinstant? Bitcopia? Direct on SR?

Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’<br /><br />So when Silk Road held the ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’, the site’s highest-grossing and most trusted vendor, “Tony76”, jumped on board, offering fabulous discounts on his products and for the first time ever opened up shop to buyers outside North America.&nbsp; Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity.<br /><br />And Tony, sadly, had to ask all buyers to finalize early until he could sort out the situation with the scammer.&nbsp; And of course they did.&nbsp; He was the most highly respected and prolific seller on Silk Road; the buyers had had countless transactions that went smoothly; anyway, to not finalize might mean missing out on a bargain.<br /><br />A week later the rumblings started.&nbsp; The local orders should have arrived by now.&nbsp; Tony wasn’t answering messages.&nbsp; The bespoke site Tony had set up was gone.<br /><br />Two weeks later the rumbles became a roar as it became clear that the most trusted vendor on Silk Road had absconded with what buyers estimated was over a hundred thousand dollars for a single weekend’s work.&nbsp; One moderator of the forums placed it at a cool quarter of a million dollars.<br /><br />There followed much angst and hand-wringing going on at Silk Road.&nbsp; Some believed Tony76 was killed by Mexican drug lords.&nbsp; Others assumed he had been busted. Many refused to believe that someone in their ‘Community’ would do such a thing. Then came the conspiracy theories: he is already selling under another name; Silk Road’s owners are in on it; it’s all part of a worldwide sting and nobody is safe; Tony76 is actually a Canadian bikie gang.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest surprise to take from this is the number of people who are shocked that a drug dealer would rip them off.&nbsp; Silk Road’s advice:&nbsp; never trade outside of escrow.<br /><br />It’s a lesson that will stay with their customers for a long time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s a great story for the newbies to read. Just like on the West side of Chicago it&#039;s buyer beware. Some ties you get really good shit and sometimes you get whoop bags.

				At first, getting bitcoins can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Follow these instructions:<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.

There is no reason to get your bitcoins from anywhere but a reputable exchange, such as Mt. Gox ... and you have to ask yourself, Why is this guy trying to sell bitcoins on SR when he can sell them on an exchange? It&#039;s weird and is probably some kind of scam ... or maybe he IS a cop ... either way, steer clear and never give out identifying information on this site, such as your PayPal address or email address.

				Another newbie here says thanks to this great thread. Yes buying drugs is always a risky business so am glad to read all of the above. The drugs I&#039;m particularly interested in are mdma, cocaine and maybe some of the psychedelics. Just getting my head around the whole bitcoin thing. In the last week bitcoins have jumped up and down in price a lot - is it always like this? If bitcoin price is high does that mean the drug price will come down? Once I get my head around the encryption and security thing intend to jump on in and buy some products. Does that mean we do not have to FE on the first deal as I read somewhere that the buyer has to prove herself first?<br />Thanks for all the helpful posts<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Noob Question: If you don&#039;t FE I don&#039;t understand how that stops you from getting scammed, all the vendor would have to do is wait until the time limit runs out, and even if they don&#039;t i&#039;m pretty sure the only options are like request a refund or request longer wait time? it&#039;s your word against theirs, thanks in advance for your answers.

				I don&#039;t know if this qualifies as a scam, but a vendor asked me for $5 in bitcoin (for added shipping) and said that was .5BTC. In case anyone hasn&#039;t noticed, the price of bitcoin has gone way up lately and at least one vendor doesn&#039;t seem to have noticed. I doubt many vendors are dropping prices to reflect the increased value of bitcoin... but buyers should be aware of what a bitcoin is worth. Here&#039;s a site that does the math for you...<br /><br />http://preev.com/

Bitcopia? Direct on SR?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I advise using btcquick.com. They are relatively new, but have good feedback on bitcointalks. I have done transactions with them multiple times, with no issues at all. You are protected from fraud because they use Google Wallet for fund transfers...Google Wallet never gives out your CC info or anything else. They merely send the vendor a one-time-use CC number for the value of the transaction, and they get the funds from that. Also, Google Wallet provides a free fraud-check/anti-fraud program that works so efficiently, that I have had my account frozen a couple times due to using TOR during transactions, and lacking a SOCKS5 proxy to place my IP in the same region as my Billing Address for my CC. This method and vendor allows for fast (usually no longer than an hour at the extremity of wait time) and efficient BTC purchase for funding your account. They sell Private Keys and Mt. Gox Redeemable Codes. They do not hold insanely large amounts of BTC in stock, usually only about 50 or 60 BTC at a time from what I can tell, but they have a contact number via Google Voice that transfers to the owner&#039;s cell phone, and they tend to be on top of all Customer Service, whether it be via phone, or email. They make you buy a Bronze Membership prior to being able to order BTC (they use Google Wallet for this transaction as well) and for every BTC you buy, you get a Reward Point. When you reach 25 Reward Points, they upgrade your membership to a Silver level, and BTC become cheaper to order. They work you with Reward Points all the way up to Gold (if I recall correctly, they may even have a Platinum membership) and BTC are near the market Low as defined by Mt. Gox live exchange rates as far as I can tell. I have yet to get to a Gold/Platinum membership, but this seems to be the case. The only weird thing, is from time to time, there will be a Handling Fee when the transaction goes through (only is approximately $1), but not always. I am unsure of why this is a sometimes thing, and not just one way or the other, but either way, they provide great Customer Service, and user friendly services. The Private Key or Mt. Gox code is sent via email to your email you used to register and become a member, and you download a separate.pdf for each BTC you purchase within it. You also can download the .pdf from your account on the website in the Order History heading, after you click to view the transaction you just made. I highly recommend btcquick.com to any and everyone. They saved me the headache that comes with Mt. Gox funding, Virwox, and virtually any other exchange of any type.

				I used www.bitcopia.com today to buy some BTC. I walked into Wells Fargo, filled out a deposit slip with their account info on it, handed the cash to the teller and the coins were in my wallet before I got home.<br />Quick as hell, no bullshit third parties to deal with or random extra fees. Highly recommend them and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

				I can also vouch for bitcopia. Although the teller was nosy and I had to bullshit up a semi-believable story. Service itself is fast and fine.<br /><br />Another good idea which just happened to me is it&#039;s fine to simply use SR address for receiving address. Don&#039;t bother with online wallets because it&#039;s too easy to get phished. Remember, bitcoins are not illegal. Nor is putting bitcoins into SR! You can buy legal stuff on SR!

				I know where mandor is coming from with looking for a seller that dosnt require FE. There&#039;s a lot of sellers that require it and won&#039;t ship to buyers with less then 5 transactions. Someone even has it on his sig that he always requires FE. <br /><br />&quot;Like a true Nature&#039;s child...<br /><br />Quote from: tony76 on April 17, 2012, 08:29 am<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Terms: As with all my sales, FE is required.&quot;<br /><br />Didn&#039;t know if he was serious or not. Nice of you Scout to put this warning up on a stickie. If someone is not an authorized vendor, then no you would not want to deal with them through pm.

				At least if you haven&#039;t FEd Silk Road can get your money back. If you haven&#039;t received the product and the seller can&#039;t prove he sent it then I would assume you will get your money back.<br /><br />I know people will probably jump on my back for this but I recently did FE for an international order with a seller with outstanding feedback because he was the only person offering worldwide shipping for what I wanted. Maybe I&#039;m an idiot but his communication has been good even after I did the deal so we&#039;ll see. If it doesn&#039;t work out I&#039;ll post here.

				signed up and decided to post in the hopes that maybe ill get some reassurance but im pretty confident i got snagged. In any case maybe my experience will serve as a lesson for others f it holds true. Anyway i tried to sign up for the SR but got a error saying that new registration is closed (btw this was like a few months ago) so im like ok whatever and move on. At the moment i cant recall how i came across the link but while using tor i gained access to the SR (i can post the link if you guys want but im not sure if thats allowed). I had done some web research on experiences using the road some with pictures and what not so i was convinced it was it. It had the exact same login page the only difference being that there was no pin to enter which i assumed was because they are allowing new members since i was able to sign up. I surfed the site and it had all the pages all the products and sections and looked pretty legit with the camel dude and all. anyway i went weeks of trying to figure out how to use bit coin was finally able to purchase coins and yesterday i sent .50 as a test to the account at this &quot;SR&quot;. after a few hours of nervous waiting it showed up in my SR account and i was excited that i was finally going to get to purchase something. I sort out my checkout and see how much i need so i send over another 1.50 and shut down for the night. today i check my bitcoin site and see that the money was successfully deposited and cant wait to get home to make my purchase. i get home and try and log in and get PROBLEM LOADING error. Im like its prolly just jacked up with people cause of the weekend. Then i hop on HW and try clicking the link for the SR there and then im taken to that original page that had the pin and tells me new registration is off. I precede to freak. I had done a test transfer for .50 to see if it was legit and when it showed up i was so sure. they even linked me to these forums. I see that a lot of people were saying the site was down earlier so im trying to reassure myself thats the case but the fact that there is a login page that requests a pin thats what make me think i got scammed. so i know this is unorthodox but which is the correct page? Are they taking new registration? are there two links to the same SR? Is this common in the SR? is there a way to tell im always on the right SR and is there a way to register? Im not really too pissed cause it was only 2 BTC so a least it wasnt too much but hell it was still 2 BTC!! i hope you guys can help and i apologize for my ignorance. Clearly being a veteran on the field holds no barring in cyber space...<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />While browsing these forums i discovered the use new identity option &amp; reload and i was able to log in to the page with my 2btc still there! im desperately trying to get them out of there now. but its taking forever to load. Which&nbsp; the real SR with the pin or without the pin??

				Ive been here for a long time. Just scammed for the first time! How? Glad you asked. Over a year ago I used a MP -&gt; BTC vendor with a great reputation. With all the issues Ive been having with other ways of getting BTC&#039;s I tried the old vendor, but could only find the vendor if it had a space in the name. I didn&#039;t think anything of it. But I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve lost my money. Of course even if it was the same vendor, there&#039;s never any guarantee...

There have been many instances of established, highly-trusted vendors who decide to suddenly retire--and their exit strategy has included convincing loyal customers to FE, offering a vague-yet-plausible excuse, and then disappearing with everyone&#039;s money. While some vendors having honor and integrity would never do this, there are others who would think nothing of it. Drug dealers and drug users are not known for their moral compasses--and while that might be an unfair stereotype, at least when applied to some--I can&#039;t help but think of something that my mother told me when I was a teenager. At the time, my friends and I were focused solely on drugs; because of our youth and relative innocence, this was limited to marijuana, acid, and alcohol; and even though we had never experimented with the &quot;hard stuff,&quot; there were a few of my buddies who behaved like junkies. They thought nothing of lying to us, cheating us, burglarizing our homes ... basically doing anything that benefited themselves, regardless of whether it was a stranger or their best friend who suffered as a result. What my mother said was simple enough and had enough truth to it that it&#039;s something I&#039;ve never forgotten, even years later; and while the words were not her own, the message was/is clear.<br /><br />She said, &quot;There is no honor among thieves.&quot;<br /><br />The escrow system exists for a reason--and the only way to benefit from it is to use it. By refusing to FE, we discourage vendors from requesting it; and by only doing business with vendors who respect and abide by the escrow system, we reward honesty and encourage good business practices. Even as a newcomer to Silk Road, there is no need to FE. When considering who to purchase my first order from, I looked at a couple of vendors whose requirements would have required me to not only FE, but jump through other hoops, the details of which I&#039;ve since forgotten. I shined them on and thirty seconds later found a couple of true pros to deal with. Those other vendors could have made a sale, but instead they drove me away and I&#039;ll never be back. There are top vendors for a reason, but even they might decide to rip you off eventually. No one on SR is above suspicion. Too many people forget that this is an anonymous marketplace, the reason being that we&#039;re all criminals, with a few cops mixed in just to keep things interesting. If you have a favorite vendor and you decide to FE as a way of rewarding excellent service, fine; however, being asked to FE should send you running, regardless of stats. When you have options--and we almost always do--don&#039;t be afraid to use them.

				Hi all,<br />&nbsp;;D&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br />As a total noob to TOR and these forums, I guess I have been lucky not to have been scammed. Normally, I will only FE once goods received and sampled. But mindful of how this may cause difficulties to some with cash flow probs and who request me to FE, then I have. My logic being that trust has to be earned and normally my feedback will reflect this. I also think that if anyone rips me off a few BC, then ultimately they will be the loser as the old saying &#039;once bitten, twice shy&#039; is certainly relevant.<br />Anyway just by the very nature of what we are all doing here, inevitably means there will be lowlife scumbags lurking around.<br />I think the Escrow system is a really fantastic way to ensure safety and trust can be built up. And the main thing reaslly is that the SR is 2nd to none. I remember scoring 30+ yeras ago and though the quality was, IMO, far superior than today at least SR is so simple in its anonymity and minus the customs means its virtually safe for the foreseeable future.<br />We all get our gear, safely and without the sleazy trappings of yesteryear.<br />My respect for SR grows day by day and as long as I harm no others then the solution and the streets remain&nbsp; free.<br /><br />I probably sound like an old nearly 60yr old tart whose as naive as a pair of unlicked bollux... lol.<br /><br />BTW... I think TopNotch is my fav, but thats for another board.<br /><br />Cheers &amp; regards to all. :)

				A good thread. I have yet to purchase, but have been monitoring the site for a few months. I&#039;ve noticed a few other trusted sellers go down in the same manner as Tony76, just not to the same degree. Always look on the profiles and threads for feedback from a vendor. You can still get anything listed by finding a vendor using escrow, you just might pay more. Watch out for &quot;too good to be true&quot; prices. The vendors I&#039;ve been watching that offer these (w/o escrow), are usually the ones I notice going rogue. MedicinoMistress was one that I noticed this happening to. I can&#039;t confirm that they have fallen apart, but their rating fell considerably over a week, and they wouldn&#039;t reply when I confronted them with questions. Their feedback showed that customers were getting worried.

				Hey Everyone, my first post!<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m pretty new here. So I was so excited about this site that I did a couple of &quot;mistakes&quot; in my first time.<br /><br />1)I didn&#039;t use PGP...at all, anywhere.<br />2) I wrote my real name and address on the Moneygram slip (at Walmart) to send money to my MtGox account.<br /><br />I&#039;m panicking a bit tbh. Especially that I just got in trouble today with the cops...for a totally different reason.<br /><br />So, how risky is my position?<br /><br />Is there a chance that the shit might hit the fan?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, what should I do?<br /><br />Thanks!

				ALWAYS USE PGP.&nbsp; Encrypt your address every time you send it to a vendor for an order.<br /><br />As for using your real name and address on the moneygram slip - you will be fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a problem.&nbsp; Buying bitcoins is 100% legal.

Can&#039;t see why not, but I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s done?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You should relax and not worry yourself. Because there are a number of security precautions in place to protect the entire community&#039;s anonymity, Silk Road exists and continues to thrive despite mainstream media coverage and scrutiny from just about every major law enforcement agency in the world. The system works as long as you remain vigilant and follow the rules, which are described in the Buyer&#039;s Guide. It is hard to imagine that the authorities won&#039;t eventually find a way to close SR down, but it is rather telling that they have been unable to do so thus far.<br /><br />Consider the following:<br /><br />-- Law enforcement is primarily concerned with shutting down SR at its source--and hopefully, arresting The Dread Pirate Roberts and his cohorts at the same time. Their main responsibility is to prevent the flow of contraband--and by cutting off the head, they kill the entire beast. Barring that, their second targets include vendors who are selling vast quantities of high-profile narcotics--the kind of shit that is regarded with fear &amp; loathing by the general public. Less successful vendors might also be targeted, but probably only if they&#039;ve been careless and made themselves vulnerable in some way. Finally, while average consumers are the lifeblood of SR--supply and demand, you know--they are considered by LE to be nothing more than a nuisance and too numerous to ever hope to combat effectively. Furthermore, LE knows that the old &quot;big fish, little fish&quot; gambit would be pointless if applied to a lowly SR member, since it is an anonymous market. No one involved--buyers, sellers, or the site&#039;s operators--knows the identity of anyone else. The only time that you submit personal information is when placing an order ... and we&#039;ll deal with that next.<br /><br />-- The mailing information that you submit is encrypted by SR and intended to be viewed only by your chosen vendor. Since SR is law enforcement&#039;s primary target, and therefore constantly at risk, you use PGP to encrypt your info a second time. Now that your message is decipherable only by its recipient, if the SR servers are seized, LE will have nothing. You also have the option of using some sort of mail drop, adding a third layer of security. (Personally, I don&#039;t bother, preferring to have my orders shipped directly to my door.)<br /><br />-- Since your vendor is the only person with your address at this point, he now becomes the weak link. If he is a professional, which will be obvious by reading his feedback and the forums, he ships your package as soon as the order is received. As long as he doesn&#039;t record your shipping info, the package&#039;s physical label is now the only record of who you are--and it&#039;s on its way to you, via the USPS. If for some reason the vendor DOES keep another copy of your information, it would be useless as evidence even in the unlikely event that he is busted. Of course, if he gets pinched on his way to the mailbox, clutching in his hand a big bag of dope with your name literally on it ... well ... then you have terrible luck. But I suppose that there&#039;s a good chance they wouldn&#039;t bother to prosecute you--and if they did, the right lawyer could get your case dismissed. Hiring a good attorney doesn&#039;t come cheap; however, having a hotshot legal wizard in your corner is a good idea, especially when you do things like order narcotics through the mail. Unfortunately, odds are that you&#039;re broke and you&#039;ll be stuck with the public defender. Shit. This wouldn&#039;t have happened if you hadn&#039;t spent all of your money on drugs.<br /><br />-- Whenever possible, order from domestic vendors to avoid scrutiny by Customs and suspicious postal employees. Delivering a dozen packages from Amsterdam to your address in less than a month will make your mail carrier take notice, even if he IS a lazy bastard who never shows up before three o&#039;clock. Domestic packages being handled by the USPS are practically invisible--and even if someone wanted to open one, they would need a warrant to do so. When choosing a vendor, look for someone who gets positive feedback regarding his stealth--that way, if your package is torn or is delivered to your neighbor by mistake (and the dummy opens it before reading the label), there won&#039;t be bags of dope spilling out all over the place. Some vendors do such a good job that even you might have a hard time finding it. When that happens, you&#039;ll momentarily wonder if you paid $150 for the decoy, an item worth about $3.99.<br /><br />-- It can be assumed that you&#039;re dealing with someone legit--not LE, posing as a vendor--as long as they&#039;re not brand new to Silk Road. Since cops can&#039;t ship drugs to people through the mail, any established vendor is safe. Again, read the feedback and forums. Besides, the cost of going after a buyer, making an arrest, jailing him, prosecuting the case, eventually imprisoning him ... well ... the cost of all that is extraordinary when weighed against what there is to be gained. So no, you&#039;re not buying drugs from the DEA.<br /><br />-- It&#039;s obvious by now that law enforcement doesn&#039;t have the time, money, resources, or inclination to target buyers on SR; therefore, they&#039;re not going to undertake the nearly-impossible task of tracing your bitcoins back to you, especially since you&#039;re talking about a digital currency that is virtually untraceable to begin with. Personally, I send a MoneyGram (real name, fake name ... who cares?) to BitInstant, who then funds a throwaway account at Mt. Gox (feel free to create a new one for every transaction, although it&#039;s unnecessary). After purchasing bitcoins anonymously on the open market, I send them to my SR wallet, which can also be changed for each transaction. (The logic behind this is that even if LE could link you to your SR account, there would be no way to tie all of the transactions together.) Some people also route their bitcoins through another anonymous e-wallet service before sending them along to SR, although I consider it unnecessary. It&#039;s worth noting that you should only transfer the necessary amount of bitcoins to your SR wallet when you are ready to make a purchase. Order immediately and don&#039;t store money with SR, because if the site is busted or suddenly disappears, so does all of the money you have in your account. The same thing goes for Mt. Gox, which has been targeted by hackers in the past.<br /><br />I suppose that I could go on, but what would be the point? Silk Road is a multimillion-dollar operation that was carefully designed to protect its users and resist attacks from law enforcement. There are numerous precautions in place, from your Tor browser to the escrow system and right on down the line. I&#039;m not going to swear that getting busted is impossible ... but I will venture to say that finding a cop waiting outside for you is only slightly more likely than walking to your car and having a piano fall on your head.<br /><br />As long as you follow the rules, you can buy all sorts of illegal shit with utter confidence, unconcerned that while you shave and have your morning coffee, the postman is downstairs jamming your mailbox full of felonies ... but if you&#039;re not quite there yet--if you&#039;re still biting your nails and unable to sleep after placing an order--Silk Road has something for that too. Lots of things, really. I hear that Valium works wonders.<br /><br />Or maybe it&#039;s all that speed you bought last week that&#039;s keeping you awake ... or it could just be that when it comes to waiting for a fix, you have about as much patience as a kid at Christmas time. Who knows when one is dealing with junkies--trying to predict or account for that crowd&#039;s behavior can drive a person bananas.<br /><br />Goddamned drug addicts.

				First of all-hello! Yes I am very brand new-still wearin my SR diapers lol. Great to be here. I want to thank you for clearing up that FE thing-I had no idea what that was all about either-there is so much to learn here and WOW holy shit about that scam with Tony! I don&#039;t know what to say-I don&#039;t hope he was killed but at same time I really hope he did not sincerely scam all those people out of that money-but you all know how some people in this world can really be and it&#039;s a shame. Thank you for the warnings and great advice.

				Just read the first couple of pages of this and am kind of kicking myself right now, but whatever. Live and learn, and so on.<br /><br />Either way, is there a list of vendors that have used the FE scam on multiple buyers? I&#039;m only on page 4 of this thread, so forgive me if it is in the later pages. At any rate, I just made my first purchases from a few different vendors on SR. Two out of the four said that they required new buyers to &#039;FE.&#039; Of course, I went ahead and did it (like a dumb ass, I trusted in the fact that they both had perfect ratings. Once I realized that finalizing and order means you can never go back and edit your comments, well, I realized that they could be pulling the FE scam on multiple new users, and still be getting positive feedback.)<br /><br />Where was I? Oh yeah, so I don&#039;t know for sure that I have been scammed, but neither of the vendors has responded to my recent messages, so I am preparing myself for that fact that I have indeed been scammed. Since I am unable to go back and change my feedback for the vendor, how else will I be able to expose them for the fucking pricks that they are?<br /><br />Thanks and such.<br /><br />BL

				I got scammed £350 the other day on localbitcoins.com. usualy a safe site but i done instant bank transfer without using escrow and trader cancelled deal after funding and ran with my money. Thieving scum bag. All my own fault as i was being impatient and took a chance. If using that site and bank transfer stick to escrow and stick with the guys you know and have traded with before. If possible meet in person, leads to good contact building.

				In Escrow means there&#039;s a hold on it, when you make a purchase SR holds the funds until you finalize usually after you get you order and are satisfied. And someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong but Bitfloor and SR act identically on a PC or a MAC,

				just want to share this cuz it is really cool, and it works really good!<br />www.bitcoinity.org/markets<br />it is a real time graph of bitcoin prices. if you&#039;re like me &amp; will only be making small buys &amp; keeping a small amount of bitcoin handy - you might as well try to buy your BC at the fairest price. for instance: just 2 days ago, on wednesday, around midnight, for about an hour, prices dropped and you could buy BC for $36 +/-. yeah, not as good as $20, but way better than $45, and today&#039;s price is pretty steady at $43.50<br />as for me, i missed it cuz i didn&#039;t find this site til thursday. i&#039;m still getting organized &amp; i expect i need to visit the PGP club soon...

				Thanks so much for posting this!!!&nbsp; The problem I am having being new here is that some vendors will not sell to you unless you have so many transactions under your belt.&nbsp; So you are left with vendors that will sell to you but demand that you finalize early.&nbsp; I just ordered for the first time and it looks like I was ripped off from a vendor that has good reviews but I noticed they all said what I wrote.&nbsp; Good communication but asked to FE early, we will see.&nbsp; Now that it has been over two weeks I have no way to go back in an change my feedback as I have no idea how.&nbsp; If this vendor makes no effort to resolve this matter I will take to the forum and blast his/her name.<br /><br />This site only works if we work like a community and watch out for each other.

				yup good info <br />stay in escro&nbsp; !!!! It is there for a reason!!!!!!!&nbsp; <br />If a vendor is asking for a newbie to FE go to another one and ask if they will&nbsp; take you on as a new client .I did this and it worked.I made a few small purchases built up my rep and now i get free stuff occassionally .<br />But really for the new guys if a vendor needs you to FE make sure its something you can loose. Some do ask for international reasons (coming through customs) but others say they have money tied up .I dont like that .<br />If they dont have money then they are not doing their job correctly ..I dont see alot of good deals on SR. We are paying high prices for the safety and quality so vendors should have a good amount of $ coming in.<br />People do forget to F so dont forget to finalize when you get your package.(it happens alot) Guys go get high first then forget about the finalizing .I always do it first then ill put a review here..<br />

				Newbie here....and about the Bitcoin thing, its driving me nuts.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know whether to upgrade my PC and try mining my own.&nbsp; I joined about three pools and NADA.&nbsp; Since their value is up right now....I can see why there would be lots of scams. I almost got caught up in one :( So this is my official first post, and I&#039;m open to any suggestions at all, but I have heard mixed reviews on mining my own and that joining a pool is a really good idea.The geek in me wants to save money and mine my own.&nbsp; Even if it doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;d have a kick ass PC.&nbsp; Any directions or recipes on doing this would be great. I have a few bits and pieces of coins all over, but not enough to send to my wallet.... well, at least I can&#039;t scam myself, but on a side note, I think it would be easy for a pool to scam you as well.

				There is no reason to ever have to buy bitcoins from anyone advertising on the forums as they are all scams and I personally would never purchase bitcoins from one of the vendors on silkroad if I ever needed to purchase some for whatever reason there are MANY legit exchanges that make transactions as anonymous as you can get.

				New here and just checking everything out. I have known about SR for a while but have only done a bunch of research up to this point. I always research and talk to people about things like this and their experiences before I take any kind of risk. I have learned from reading a bunch here and on different places always do your research and if you don&#039;t have the answer find it or ask someone that can help. <br /><br />I look forward to making my first purchase here in the next couple of days. I will be getting some BTC tomorrow as that was one of my main concerns was to do it as anonymously as possible,<br /><br />

				I&#039;m new here too, so you have to make up your own mind (duh). <br />I like the idea of going into a bank, making a cash deposit, going home and finding that it&#039;s already on the site I deposited to. I think the only concession you make to anonymity is that all banks have cameras. But as far as I know, you are just a regular customer. Maybe if you brought $10,000 you would get extra scrutiny. The last time a guy asked me for a phone number, and I made one up. The first two times they didn&#039;t ask me for anything. Then I buy whatever I want from BitFloor (paid almost $80 a BTC, it&#039;s REALLY gone up lately) and download to my computer (Qt 4.8.3).. <br />Anyway, that&#039;s how BitCopia and BitFloor work. I&#039;ve used BitFloor 3 times and that&#039;s how it works. If you are someplace where there are no Wells Fargo (BitCopia) or Bank of America (BitFloor) banks then obviously this wouldn&#039;t work. But there are other set ups with banks. <br />When I go in, I tell them I&#039;m making a &#039;cash deposit to my stockbroker&#039;, because BitFloor is also a stockbroker.<br />With the above arrangement, why would you ever want to send cash to somebody? Or anything else, even money paks or Western Union. When I deposited $1000 a couple of days ago, the total deposit to get $1000 to BitFloor was $1018, that&#039;s less than 2% fee. <br />You have to be worried about these phishing sites, like the fake silk road that&#039;s linked from the Wiki page. Wiki means that anybody can edit, and there&#039;s scammers that as soon as somebody fixes the Wiki, it gets changed to the scamming address right away. <br />I&#039;d stick with the real mainstream entities, like BitFloor or MtGix (that&#039;s another scam site, I think with a space between Mt and Gix, like Mt Gix. You have to be VERY careful, there are a LOT of clever thieves who like to separate newcomers from their BTC. <br />JMHO. <br /><br />

				fuck, I wish I had seen the forums section before going on SR. Im a total fucking noob &amp; got stung £1000 last week by Bitcoinbillionaires! Bastard!!<br /><br />anyway, now I have found the forums I have found so much information about sorting pgp&#039;s &amp; tormail. <br /><br />I find trying to purchase coins in the UK to be a complete and utter nightmare, maybe thats me just not knowing where to look to ensure that I stay safe buying them, for instance using bank transfers etc how can this be safe, paper trail &amp; order person obtaining you bank info when you send them dosh too. <br /><br />Any pointer on any aspect of anything regarding the silk road is defo in theis forum so I will be reading till me head pops.<br /><br />First post but I hope to hang about :)

				What I have found has been quite a bit of frustration so far.&nbsp; It takes forever to get things done.&nbsp; There is no clear FAQ on this.&nbsp; All of the FAQs are woefully incomplete and once I have this shit down I am going to do one so that nobody has to go through this crap again.&nbsp; I have been fucking around with this now for 18 days and am still not at the point where I can make a purchase on Silk Road.&nbsp; You would think that Silk Road would be all over this, but they are not either.<br /><br />This defies explanation.

				not really a new member...i started about 7 months ago when a friend showed me the road and introduced me to methylone..never made an account since i had no access to computers at the time...well, in the past 2 months my friend and i have been scammed fucking twice while trying to receive bitcoins. do not, i repeat DO NOT use BankofBTC, he recently just scammed my friend and i out of $84..might not seem alot but when youre considered a minor it iss a good bit to work for. he cancled order, read messages and did not reply to them. gave bitcoins to another buyer that had the same problem but not to my friend and i. still have not received BTC...only reliable vendor for BTC now is sugarmama. wish Captainmal was still around like he was when i started...

				BitInstant worked for me, although they were having problem with the MtGox API, and it took about 36 hours to get money onto my MtGox account. Sure they take a cut, but it certainly seems like less of a headache and more reliable than many other methods. I might try something else for my next deposit, just to diversify, but if I ever need some fairly quick BitCoins then I&#039;ll be using them again. Molly, why do you purchase BitCoins through vendors? It just seems like a good way to get scammed eventually.

				I got scammed by trying to use INSTAWALLET through TOR onion routing. This was my mistake because I briefly read about putting bitcoins in a secure wallet other than in SR account. To make a long story short. DO NOT USE &quot;INSTAWALLET&quot; THAT HAS A ONION ADDRESS. Like this:&nbsp; http://3rlqkicvauds47ch.onion/wallet.php?w=IcD2HASwDK4LsiIWaYWH8Zbk0&nbsp; This is the site I went through to transfer my bitcoins from MTGOX to who fucking knows....&nbsp; The real instawallet is a .ORG site and reputable from what I researched. Before you do anything, research the hell out of these forums. Learn from my mistake. Trust no one. There is an unusual amount of shady characters lurking this area of the web. This should also be considered a phishing scam but it involves BitCoins, so I posted it here.

Today I read again his condinion and it says : NEW BUYERS MUST FINALIZE EARLY<br />NEW BUYER: LESS THAN 5 PURCHASE OR &lt;5% REFUND RATE<br />IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE OK WITH THIS TERMS PLEASE ADD A MESSAGE THAT SAYS &quot;WILL FE&quot; IN ADDRESS BOX.<br />After reading I gave Finalize evaluated and gave 3/5 rating and wrote as soon as I change the order arrives rating.<br />What do you think? Do you think that when the status of my order &quot;in transit&quot; that the order has been sent?<br />Thank you for answers and advice !!! :)<br /><br />(English is not my native language - excuse lots of errors please :D :) )

				The very nature of a MoneyPak for Bitcoin exchange means things cannot be done in escrow.&nbsp; You take your chances when doing such a thing because there are no funds fronted by anyone that SR can hold onto until the transaction is complete (&quot;finalized&quot;).&nbsp; Escrow, in laymans terms, means that you deposit the funds with SR.&nbsp; SR will not release these funds to the vendor until you &quot;finalize&quot; the transaction.&nbsp; Once you &quot;finalize&quot; SR releases the &quot;deposit&quot; to the vendor.&nbsp; If you finalize before receiving your order (the transaction is technically not complete) you are releasing the deposit and that&#039;s that.&nbsp; There is no longer any leverage to keep the vendor at the counter until you have your goods.<br /><br />As I previously stated, a MoneyPak for BitCoin exchange has no funds fronted at the start of the transaction.&nbsp; The vendor can simply take the MoneyPak number you gave out and simply walk away.&nbsp; We can work to get those parasites banned but recovering your MoneyPak is very difficult and cannot happen thru SR.&nbsp; You would have to open a case with GreenDot to make life difficult for the jerk who stole your MoneyPak.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to do and you aren&#039;t compromising anything since both MoneyPak and Bitcoin are totally legal.&nbsp; Thievery of either is not.&nbsp; So, you could go to bed at night knowing that eventually this clown will see his balance but can&#039;t withdraw squat.&nbsp; If he&#039;s stupid enough he may even see this balance from the pokey.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that my friends, after being scammed my share of times from ilk like BankOfBtc, allows me to hit the pillow with a sh*t-eating grin on my face

				Well looks like my very first purchase on SR was a scam. Bought 10gm of MDMA from Chemicalsisters, who insist because of scammers, you have to finalize early. Now it seems as if no other US buyers are getting their order lately. Chances are I won&#039;t get my package either. Looks like I learned the hard way. Now I know.

Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’<br /><br />So when Silk Road held the ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’, the site’s highest-grossing and most trusted vendor, “Tony76”, jumped on board, offering fabulous discounts on his products and for the first time ever opened up shop to buyers outside North America.&nbsp; Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity.<br /><br />And Tony, sadly, had to ask all buyers to finalize early until he could sort out the situation with the scammer.&nbsp; And of course they did.&nbsp; He was the most highly respected and prolific seller on Silk Road; the buyers had had countless transactions that went smoothly; anyway, to not finalize might mean missing out on a bargain.<br /><br />A week later the rumblings started.&nbsp; The local orders should have arrived by now.&nbsp; Tony wasn’t answering messages.&nbsp; The bespoke site Tony had set up was gone.<br /><br />Two weeks later the rumbles became a roar as it became clear that the most trusted vendor on Silk Road had absconded with what buyers estimated was over a hundred thousand dollars for a single weekend’s work.&nbsp; One moderator of the forums placed it at a cool quarter of a million dollars.<br /><br />There followed much angst and hand-wringing going on at Silk Road.&nbsp; Some believed Tony76 was killed by Mexican drug lords.&nbsp; Others assumed he had been busted. Many refused to believe that someone in their ‘Community’ would do such a thing. Then came the conspiracy theories: he is already selling under another name; Silk Road’s owners are in on it; it’s all part of a worldwide sting and nobody is safe; Tony76 is actually a Canadian bikie gang.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest surprise to take from this is the number of people who are shocked that a drug dealer would rip them off.&nbsp; Silk Road’s advice:&nbsp; never trade outside of escrow.<br /><br />It’s a lesson that will stay with their customers for a long time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m rather green to SR, so this was really helpful!<br />I&#039;ll keep this in mind, and never FE! :D

				thanks for the heads up, but being a new vendor, only having a couple of transactions in place, although I had a couple of earlier transactions with an old account but forgot the password, and I have had to finalize early both times, after reading all of the threads people say about not to finalize early, leaves you in a bit of catch 22 position. All I can do i pray.....<br />trying to find a good reliable vendor is like finding love.... in a way. :)

If that doesn&#039;t work just bite the bullet and FE on a trusted sender for a small order :)

				BitInstant works like a charm. Use bitinstant to Virwox to 3rd wallet then to SR.<br />Only FE&#039;d once and I liked it as much as a fucking root canal, but the product was worth it. Took the chance and got my product. I would never say &#039;don&#039;t FE&#039;, that&#039;s your call. In my perspective it may be a necessary evil. On the up side it built up a trust with the vendor and I doubt that he asks me to do it again. On the downside, you get fucked out of your btc.

				Thank you for all the really useful info in this thread. <br /><br />I expected a steep learning curve getting my head round SR, but I didn&#039;t realise that working with bitcoins was going to be such a minefield. I thought it was just a matter of buying a bunch of BTC online and then using &#039;em to buy stuff off SR. I&#039;m glad I read this thread before actually buying any coins &#039;cos now I can see how many scams there are out there.<br /><br />I still haven&#039;t bought any bitcoins or shopped on SR. Still looking for a decent UK bitcoin seller who not only delivers but also doesn&#039;t charge way over the odds for coins.<br /><br />Addicts are notorious for wanting stuff by yesterday at the latest, which is why I reckon that so many scammers get away with stuff here. A bit of patience and a bit of research can save a whole heap of tears!

				Been browsing The Road for a while. Came across many items id love to try but i have most (though maybe lower quality at times) things available to me now. That and i value the low amount of coins i own now more than the items i would be interested in grabbing. Im a pretty safe shopper and doubt the minor tripfalls will scam me once i do. Good reads, headups, and warnings on this thread though. However earnthebitcoin.com still to few offers for me to actually complete to redeem my coins. Grr. Besides that, great site, forums and i may actually be selling before i buy.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Agreed. NEVER Finalize Early (with a seller you don&#039;t have a relationship with)<br /><br />You see so many vendor pages saying they require you to FE if you live in a certain country, if it&#039;s over a certain order amount, etc. But know that it&#039;s agains SR policy for a vendor to require FE. <br /><br />I lost $400 because the vendor page said it was required for US buyers, and as soon as I finalized their account went into stealth mode and I haven&#039;t heard from or seen them on SR again. As long as a scammer can make back the initial SR deposit required for new sellers, they will keep at it.<br /><br />Too bad we can&#039;t all just buy our illegal drugs in peace, without worrying about criminals. :)

				My first order on SR I didn&#039;t FE, still I was scammed. It was a small order with a highly trusted UK-vendor (100). And even though I never recieved any goods or even a customs letter the SR ruled a 50% refund. Newbies can easily be targeted for select scams even if you do stay in escrow.

Even if a vendor is mostly on the up and up, has good/high stats, and good reviews, some have been selectively scamming.. This is when they pick one person out of however many to rip off. It seems to be going on more and more recently, and with reputable vendors. Possibly to pad their overhead costs due to large fluctuation in bitcoin prices. It&#039;s possible that some of these vendors just made mistakes and the buyers just assumed they were ripped off. But when selectively scamming it would make sense to do it to people that FE. Especially if you are new and have little or no buying stats. So if they put up new listings that all ask you to FE or change all of their existing ones then they might be selectively scamming.<br />I would recommend to only FE with a vendor you have successfully&nbsp; made a purchase from using escrow. If there is an item you want to purchase and the vendor require FE for new buyers, move on. There is most likely the same item for sale by a vendor that is new buyer friendly. Find one that doesn&#039;t require FE. There are even some vendors that are nice enough and patient enough to walk new buys through the whole process. I only FE when I have built up a relationship with a seller through several successful transactions. They also usually give me a little extra product for doing so too. <br />

I have gone ahead and read his post. it&#039;s very useful. I&#039;ve also gone ahead and asked the same quesiton. Perhaps you can help me out although you&#039;ve somewhat answered the question for me partially:<br /><br />&quot;I have a quick question regarding international orders that need to be resolved. I&#039;m coming up on 4-5 days before auto finalization is happening and still haven&#039;t gotten my package. Should I have already talked to my dealer about a resolution? Do i need to hit resolve button in order to open a ticket with the &quot;resolution center&quot;? What is the best way to go about this? &quot;<br /><br />so first go ahead and talk to the dealer. When would it be a good idea to hit teh resolve button? White out says 12-15 days into a domestic order, but I&#039;m pretty much there with this non domestic order. Should I hurry up and shoot a message to the dealer asking what kind of resolution we can work out and let him know I&#039;ll be hitting resolve in the next 2 days?(leaving me with 2-3 days before auto finalization)?

				They always say never FE but as a new user I found rarely do I have a choice - always something like &#039;if you have 5 or less transactions you MUST FE...&#039; and 90%+ of sellers have this.

				I can&#039;t believe people actually fall for bitcoin scams. I saw a clearnet site discussing SR with someone trying to do bitcoin scams in the comments section and numerous replies by people saying that they got scammed out of several hundred dollars each. <br /><br />Thievery is immoral, but use your brain.<br /><br />It&#039;s like people clicking on banner ads or popup adds saying &quot;You won $1,000&quot;.<br /><br />

				Once you build trust with a vendor you can FE if you like,(YOU NEVER HAVE TO UNLESS SPECIFIED) I used to have a selling account and cash flow can be a real bitch with the whole escrow thing.. you have to go into stealth mode to stop people buying just to make sure you can reload again but once you got the flow sorted its all good. <br />Any vendor who always delivers and has gained your trust over time, deserves FE just to make their lives a little easier. <br /><br />Symbisios(I can never spell it right) is always next day delivery for me so I FE for him now.. hes big time so probably doesnt give a fuck either way but I do feel sorry for some sellers dangerous game they are playing..<br /><br />Bitcoin rise is like a little benefits scheme to cover all the sellers problems haha<br />

				Yes I agree about not FE when not dealing with face to face, but as street service provider the one time you give on credit something, when the client promises to pay you end of month or few days because no cash machine is around, they tend to go missing for a little while :) but my honest feeling to this is when you do things out of routine with a someone, thats when things go wrong.

				my current situation really blows.... I placed a pretty big order with a vendor, DubG, who appears to be legit. I d he sent me an email telling me how &quot;money is tied up and if I fe he would be generous in the next order&quot;, so with his rep being high and his feedback good, I did it, plus I did appreciate the value of hte product for the money. When I got the package the box was all bent up which wasn&#039;t a big deal, but it was short and not what was promised ( a lot of shake and a little short on weight)... I sent him an email saying it was short but he could hook it up next time, like he already said he would, since I fE&#039;d when he was in a bind.... So I order again, his last of the &quot;wholesale&quot; he said he was having about a week ago, and he said he would get it right out, be there by &quot;sat&quot; if not guaranteed monday, etc. I didn&#039;t get it saturday, he said he&#039;d check the tracking but didn&#039;t have it at the moment, asked him sunday if he got it, he said no and &quot;everything was so hectic&quot;....then, asks for my city and all that like he is gonna finally give me tracking, and he says &quot;It looks like i shipped double to someone else near you, I will make it whole, either a refund or different bud from another &quot;top shelf&quot; but it would be less&quot;..... I told him I was really in a bind and didn&#039;t have time to wait and that he needed to check tracking and verify it with me and I wanted to avoid a dispute if possible, because time is of the essence to me right now.... well when he responded he basically told me I was a scammer and would have to wait til resolution because &quot;many scams have been going on lately&quot;...hmmmm...ya, no kidding...... He has been horrible with answering me despite me expressing the importance of this, i mean, i gave a dud 525 dollars and 650 last week and he won&#039;t even respond when I tell him how urgent it is, or take the time to give me tracking which is his end....his page guaranteed 60 hours from order to doorstep... I sent him all my transaction and buying history, like he asked, and basically it seems like he just wants to make me squirm or delay the inevitable of the refund that he even said he would give because it was his mistake.... real disappointed. I emailed admin, this is my first dispute in 11 transactions. sucks.... thank god Ididn&#039;t FE, NEVER FE! unless its someon you really really trust

				I read the excellent Tony76-story posted as an early reply to the OP and it is such a good example of what a scam is and how we all are possible victims and how we react after we have been ripped off. I especially like the part of &quot;how everyone was suprised a drug dealer ripped them off, since he was a part of the &quot;community&quot; and &quot;trustworthy&quot;. <br /><br />It points out what it takes to decieve on such a scale as this was. It, i dare say, couldn have happened if Tony76 hadnt worked hard to earn the one thing that money cant buy and which takes time and commitment to earn; trust and loyalty from his peers. In this situation you, me and everyone else are viable marks for a scam, dont fool yourself otherwise. <br /><br />I wonder, what signs of a an upcoming scam or shady deal have you noticed yourselves when been scammed or ripped off or whatever you call it? IF you haven been, be prepared because itś will happen sooner or later if there are money to be made, unfortunatly.<br /><br />The dealer that becomes &quot;hard to reach&quot; or unwilling to talk, doesn call back etc is present almost always in my history, i think. This is a big red flag. Say some order isn arriving, if the seller has really sent it he is interested to hear from you to see if it has arrived. If it hasn he has every reason to be worried too. <br /><br />Not communicating is never good and people tend to avoid thing that are uncomfortable, like those you have decieved. <br />Think about it, it goes for you employer if you are taking a sick day when on a binge or whatever. If you really are sick then you have no issue presenting this, it may even get you some sympathies. =)<br /><br />ITs getting a bit long, this post. Iĺl digress. <br /><br />F-hand<br /><br /><br /><br />

Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’<br /><br />So when Silk Road held the ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’, the site’s highest-grossing and most trusted vendor, “Tony76”, jumped on board, offering fabulous discounts on his products and for the first time ever opened up shop to buyers outside North America.&nbsp; Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity.<br /><br />And Tony, sadly, had to ask all buyers to finalize early until he could sort out the situation with the scammer.&nbsp; And of course they did.&nbsp; He was the most highly respected and prolific seller on Silk Road; the buyers had had countless transactions that went smoothly; anyway, to not finalize might mean missing out on a bargain.<br /><br />A week later the rumblings started.&nbsp; The local orders should have arrived by now.&nbsp; Tony wasn’t answering messages.&nbsp; The bespoke site Tony had set up was gone.<br /><br />Two weeks later the rumbles became a roar as it became clear that the most trusted vendor on Silk Road had absconded with what buyers estimated was over a hundred thousand dollars for a single weekend’s work.&nbsp; One moderator of the forums placed it at a cool quarter of a million dollars.<br /><br />There followed much angst and hand-wringing going on at Silk Road.&nbsp; Some believed Tony76 was killed by Mexican drug lords.&nbsp; Others assumed he had been busted. Many refused to believe that someone in their ‘Community’ would do such a thing. Then came the conspiracy theories: he is already selling under another name; Silk Road’s owners are in on it; it’s all part of a worldwide sting and nobody is safe; Tony76 is actually a Canadian bikie gang.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest surprise to take from this is the number of people who are shocked that a drug dealer would rip them off.&nbsp; Silk Road’s advice:&nbsp; never trade outside of escrow.<br /><br />It’s a lesson that will stay with their customers for a long time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, when you copy and paste from my site, a little attribution would be nice.&nbsp; Just sayin&#039; <br /><br />http://allthingsvice.com/2012/05/30/the-great-420-scam/

				Tip noted.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve noticed that lot of user FE early on some vendors. Some also write FE because of trust etc.<br />But thickheaded and careful as i am I could not help wonder; <br />Could the recent hijacking attempt of SR result in fake profiles with fake amount of fans, products and reviews? <br /><br />Just asking. Seen a lot a strange feedback&#039;s in the review/rating part of some products.. Talking about easter in the midle of May etc..<br />But might just be bad English, i dno.

				While I&#039;m a newbie in the forums, Ive actually done over 40 transactions on the road.&nbsp; i have had to &quot;FE&quot; for some goods, but this was one item from a vendor, where all other items were fully in escrow.&nbsp; Outside of that, whenever a vendor &quot;requires FE&quot; for all of their items, I would either contact them about a transaction in escrow, or look for another vendor.&nbsp; a great example of how greedy people get screwed is SamGiancana, until recently, he had coke and meth coming from canada.&nbsp; he put on his profile &quot;FE for an extra 20%,&quot; right before he took everyones money and shipped nothing.&nbsp; The only way to really get screwed is to do a transaction out of escrow.&nbsp; While I see many vendors require it for new users (apparently some people dont know how escrow works, and dont finalize until SR autofinalizes in 17 days).&nbsp; While you may have to suck it up if you have no buyer stats, any vendor that makes everyone FE is a big red flag.<br />thats just my $0.02...

				FE seems like a sure way to kiss your money goodbye unless both parties are familiar with eachother. To me, it&#039;d be like giving some cash to someone you just met who was going to go &quot;meet the dealer&quot; to get the goods. HE&#039;s never coming back.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I was wondering if you guys could help me figure out if I got scammed yesterday. I initiated a bitcoin transfer for cash with a seemingly trusted vendor/trader here, Sugar Mama BTC. Some of the other safer methods weren&#039;t accessible in my country, and based on her reviews and general likeability here, I western union-ed the money to her according to her instructions. Communication was spot on up until my money went through.After a mail from her stating a runner was picking up the money, I never heard from her again. This was around 5:30 - 6 PM ET, and she mentioned she would be working yesterday up until 7 PM EST. By the MTCN wire tracking, I saw the money has been picked up/withdrawn. So far, no money in my BTC wallet and no response from her since. She mentioned she wouldn&#039;t be working up until Monday again, and I noticed that people on the forums here mention sometimes it took up to 4 days to process their funds (varying from an hour to a day to up to four days). I&#039;m trying not to freak out as this is my first transaction related to SR, but you can imagine my worry as someone who&#039;s motto is bitcoins within an hour has taken more than one day already to process the transfer. That alongside some clear red flags like no further communication, I&#039;m&nbsp; not exactly at ease that things are going the way I planned.<br /><br />Has anyone had any similar experiences or know what&#039;s going on? I guess I won&#039;t officially find out till Monday if I&#039;ve been scammed or not, but if anyone has any input/suggestions/experiences I&#039;d really like to hear from you.<br /><br />Thank you again to the community for your constant help to us noobs.<br /><br />Thanks.

				after they are done processing (after the seller sends them) <br /><br />He will mark them in transit... at this point the money you paid for the products is kept in an escrow account or a holding tank until you receive the product and release the funds to him... <br /><br />After it is market in transit you will see an option that says Finalize, once you have received everything in good order you finalize.. <br /><br />do not finalize early unless its for small amounts, you dont have any way to get money back

				Okay, I get that you should never ever FE. What I don&#039;t understand is when you read the vendor feedback, you frequently see stuff like &quot;FE&#039;d, great communication&quot;. What&#039;s with that? Are these folks who don&#039;t read? Or are they shills who are trying to make FE seem normal? And why do buyers want to communicate with vendors? Isn&#039;t the whole point of SR to keep everything hush-hush, the less said the better? Is this newbie missing something?<br /><br />&nbsp;???

				User &quot;Ig0wdaflo&quot; seemed like the greatest guy in the world, had perfect feedback after 9 months ... sent him $300, he promised me my BTC by 10am the next day. That was four days ago, he accepted the transfer, and nothing. I sent him a LOT of messages, most nice, some obviously pissed off, because he was reading them and logging on every day. I noticed that since then, he dropped from perfect feedback down to 68 ... <br /><br />All I keep asking him for is an explanation, and I&#039;ll leave him alone. I&#039;m a nice gal, I just want some answers. He gave me his name, location (exact location), bank account number, routing number ... I don&#039;t get it. I told him if he got robbed, if he was desperate, just explain it to me and I&#039;ll understand. <br /><br />Anyone have any experience with this guy? It&#039;s the principle of the matter now, seriously. <br /><br />Edit: I should add that I&#039;m not a newbie, I just can&#039;t remember my username, email or password for my old forum.

(verify)<br /><br />Levamisole, marketed as the hydrochloride salt under the trade name Ergamisol (R12564), is an anthelminthic and immunomodulator belonging to a class of synthetic imidazothiazole derivatives. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium, in 1966, where it was prepared initially in the form of its racemate (called tetramisole).[1]The two stereoisomers of tetramisole were subsequently synthesized,[2] and the levorotatory isomer was given the name levamisole. Levamisole has been used in humans to treat parasitic worm infections, and has been studied in combination with other forms of chemotherapy for colon cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect.[3] The drug was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2000 and 2003, respectively, due to the risk of serious side effects and the availability of more effective replacement medications.[4][5] The key toxic effect of the drug is agranulocytosis, a severe depletion of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to infection.<br />Currently, levamisole remains in veterinary use as a dewormer for livestock. The medication has also been increasingly used as an adulterant in cocaine sold in the US and Canada, resulting in serious side effects.[<br />Published on: April 26 2013<br />Tested by: PineappleLove<br />Vendor: 10toes<br />Listed as: &quot;Premium Fishscale Cocaine&quot;<br />Purchasing method: Anonymous<br />Results:<br />48% Cocaine<br />46% Levamisole<br />6% Caffeine

				Yep Arms Depot (AD) are a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />All nicey nicey and chatty before payment- then BHAM after payment they do not contact you for any number of messages. I pointed out that their Site was the same as &#039;Executive Outcomes&#039; (EO) and they posted a disclaimer that they had nothing to do with them immediately.<br />&nbsp;<br />They said a tracking number would be provided in 7-12 days- so they have around a week and half to prove this. But I am not hopeful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also wrote to Executive Outcomes- and only got this in reply- &quot;Thanks another scam&quot;. They are identical to AD, just look jazzier.<br />&nbsp;<br />For example, just look at the spelling mistake on both sites: http://imwvq3drst5zens6.onion/index.php ... er=product on EO and on http://2ousn6z3qfxvcv7t.onion/ArmsDepot ... oductID=84 on AD. It should be Lone WOLF threaded Barrel. Spelling mistakes, same layout and product offerings on both sites??? Smells very fishy to me.<br />Luckily I placed a very small order on AD I could afford to lose. Losing money is losing money- but the lesson is worth it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bests<br />Shenobie

The scam was some photo that was hacked or something (sorry don&#039;t know a lot about puters) but I know a few of us bought certain things, sent the bitcoins to some address and the real vendor never got anything. <br /><br />I know a lot more now about the different scams but confess I am glad I have a trusted bitcoin merchant.<br /><br />The information here is good in parts but wish people would just stop using it to make 50 posts!<br /><br />

				I have found that reading these forums will save you lots of time and trouble. Research your vendor here before placing orders. Also communicate with the vendor too, read their vendor page thoroughly, and most will answer your concerns maturely. Most importantly is Never FE (finalize early).<br />

				in case it has not been said already..&nbsp; &nbsp; if you decide to make an account at ATL.. or BM, do NOT use the same login credentials.<br /><br />when SR was down at the end of April i went over to ATL just to see what was going on, and my lazy ass used the same login credentials from SR.&nbsp; The next day when i try to log in to SR, my password had been changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;5 days later when admin were able to get me into my account, i had 0 BTC left in my account.&nbsp; it was a lazy dipshit move on my part to create a duplicate login, and i paid for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;all be warned!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Not pointing fingers, but ATL can fuck off.&nbsp; As for my lesson, that&#039;s what i get for steering away from SR. <br />My apologies DPR and the rest of the crew!

				Hi All, <br /><br />a research request.<br /><br />out of interest, ( i havent read all the pages but most dont seem to tell anyway) what are the amounts people are trying to buy? I&#039;m going to be setting up as a bitcoin dealer over the next few months and my first trades selling bitcoins will be small too as i build rep and confidence in regular clients just as they do with me. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to be set up by end of july but only if all goes well. a bit of logistics required for what i wish to do due to coveing mor thna one country and currency. <br /><br />All the best everyone and safe travels,<br />Gatty

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m having trouble with MT. GOX Bitcoin Exchange. Has anyone dealt with them, and if so how was the experience?! I&#039;ve just tried to deposit bitcoins into SR and though it&#039;s registered the withdrawal from their side, my account is still empty. Is there a waiting period for the transfer from one to the other, and if so how long?!<br /><br />would really appreciate any useful feedback.<br /><br />cheers Pointer79 :-[

				Decided to go with a cash in the mail service rather than have a transaction attached to a real world account - newbie paranoia strikes deep - not sure how clean you can actually wash a bitcoin or even how to do it! Used a reputable SR vendor - but sweating on my coin a bit now and wondering how insane I must have been to stick all that cash in the mail to a total stranger! First night nerves - sure it will be fine! Tell me it will be fine... somebody, please...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Update:<br />And lo, it came to pass that everything was indeed fine...

				very informative topic here... I have been using sr for a year now and only was asked to fe 1 time on my first purchase it was a small purchase and i took the risk.. the vendor made it very well worth it for me and i had 0 issues but that doesnt mean tha all vendors can be as trustworthy just i got lucky enough to find a descent vendor

Sadly, though, I&#039;m coming to the conclusion that trying to buy BCs is (maybe especially here in Canada) leaves you more prone to getting scammed than even buying drugs on SR.

				Stupid noob question: Do I have to buy my bitcoins anonymous if I buy them a mt. glox or btc-e? I have to send them a copy of my ID to be able to deposit money and to stay anonymous Id need a fake ID.

				I don&#039;t think Mtgox will be able to tell where your funds come from. You would have to xfer to your wallet before xferring to them anyway. And even if they did they wont care, as to them it&#039;s just more business.<br /><br />Bitbargain.co.uk is a very different architecture, instant xfers from UK customers that want to change money for BTC rather than major centralized company dealing with your money.

				I was thinking the same. This forum account is new because I couldn&#039;t for the life of me remember my forum password. I placed an order with uroosa336 and they cancelled on me with no explanation. Since my buyer account is old with stellar stats, they probably assumed if wasn&#039;t worth the effort to try and get me to FE. An alarming # of people have fallen for it unfortunately. If you have FEd for uroosa336, say bye bye to your money and don&#039;t bother getting your hopes up looking for your shipment.

				Just to ask my question once more, I know that any exchanges outside of escrow are not looked on kindly, so I have not given out my SR bitcoin address again via PM (and have changed it) but is your private SR address something that you have to keep private?<br /><br />Surely only I can access my SR wallet when I sign in with my password?

				It really goes without saying that you shouldn&#039;t jump on a brand new vender selling coins for MP. I bookmarked Enjoy The Coin so that I could watch his operation but now I see I made the right judgement. Pick out the longer term vendors even if their percentage is higher than you would like. A lot of SR vendors sell their coins from here when they get an accumulation. Those are the ones to watch for but you have to be patient and wait, but always watch.

				I like localbitcoins for a lot of reasons and I&#039;ve been exchanging there for quite some time. The escrow feature is nice and when doing an exchange the buyer is protected. I have to say though that waiting on people to release funds is the biggest problem. I&#039;ve got thousands of dollars&nbsp; held up at any given moment but that&#039;s simply the nature of the beast. Getting an account on SilkRoad to market my BTC exchange services is a waste of money for the most part because it is only marketing and nothing more. Word of mouth is much better in my opinion because there is no need to hype myself up. If you are looking to get BTC then send me a message here. I accept Dwolla, Cash in the mail, MoneyPak, Vanilla Reload, Western Union, and a few others.

Gox, is a breeze. Just send a MoneyGram from Wal-Mart or another retailer. You can also link your bank account. Unfortunately, the site is temporarily down as they make some improvements.<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ is perhaps the easiest method for obtaining bitcoins. Find someone near you, meet them, pay cash for BTC. I bought some yesterday and it was fast and hassle-free.<br /><br />After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, I suggest sending them through Bitcoin Fog and then to BlockChain and EasyWallet; from there, send them to Silk Road. Also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address for every transaction. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance? Recently, an SR vendor was busted and had his coins confiscated because authorities were able to trace his transactions.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay

This is unusual for someone who claims on his review thread that he is very busy right now. Also my listing is still in &quot;processing&quot; mode, which means I cannot leave feedback.<br />&nbsp;Has anyone received coin from GGatz recently?<br />&nbsp;Is this what happens after Vendors receive their bond back after $1,500 in sales?<br />&nbsp;

				GGatz got his vendor bond back and ran.

				UPDATE <br />MrBuddha - Legit, he answered all my messages almost immediately, moneypak to BTCs in almost exactly at the 48hrs as his listing says. Good man!!<br />moneyhoney - Legit had BTCs in 48hrs. didnt get response to messages but vendor states right in listing messages may not be answered. Good Vendor.<br />For all of you noobs or veterans that hate the hassle of getting BTCs go use these vendors!<br />Real review not a prop for a scam! I might also mention my buyer account had no history, would of been the easiest to rip off. Some vendors do care about their rep, especially these 2! Much appreciated guys, and I hope my reviews will help some of you.

				Bloody spammers with their bitcoin offers! <br /><br />I logged on to review a couple of items but found 3 pages plus full of spam from the usual beggars and scoundrals.<br /><br />But, I would disagree that there is no return on this continous scam. Check out the clearnet cop magnet drug markets, they are being deluged with conmen and women.<br /><br />Surely Nigeria has discovered bitcoins, so for them, even spending a 60 hour week just spamming on all the darknet markets, plus clearnet, it must be bringing in a steady trickle of dollars for them.<br /><br />The Russians also.<br /><br />In fact, name any nation, there are conmen and women who will exploit any oppertunity to seperate you from your money!<br /><br />As for vendors here, I&#039;d be very cautious if I had to buy btc that way. Best choose those with proven track records.<br /><br />And to all you spammers on here. You are NOT traders, you are thieves and parasites. Go take a long hike hopefully ending at the edge of a cliff.

				My problem is Im from australia and most people selling H or other things online here want people to FE first my other option is to go outside of AUS but then customs is a problem. Also I can&#039;t believe that in europe and the states you can get grams of h for 100-80 bucks when the aussie dollar is going higher than the u.s dollar but over here 150-300 for gear and doing the math with some vendors double that like 5.6000 for a gram 100bucks a coin 560 or so bucks for something thats in the states for 2 bit coins and we are close to the golden triangle before the year 2000 in the 90&#039;s you could get a point for 30bucks a half weight for hundred or so and it was 80% pure or higher but the cartels have released plenty of gear into aus but dealers keep users strung by the balls we need a flood in this country to bring things down just speaking my mind Im not talking about small time dealers I mean the ones who deal in thousands and thousands of kgs of the shit. Most vendors here seem nice and I look forward to trying product from some :) anyone else like to comment?

				mrbuddha scam!!!! DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER WITH THAT BITCH!!! I never FE and took the risk of moneypak--&gt;Bitcoin (which is ALL buyer risk). I hope someone just did a forum search with his name and found this. He processed transactions like a legitimate bitcoin trader, but since last weekend he began his scam. That is why he is currently at (100) on stats, to fleece as many unsuspecting buyers as possible for as long as possible. Im part of the first wave of scammed (my first time). Im glad it was for $700 and not $7,000 that a certain vendor/forum hero member just experienced.<br /><br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

				Very sorry to hear about everyone getting scammed. I have now had 2 buyers email me this am about being scammed by mrbuddha. He offered nearly no fees for btc exchange - and no fees for cash in the mail to vendors. I immediately thought this was a scam as there are fees involved in doing any type of business. I am very sorry for everyone&#039;s loss - this is just not right. Be wary of anything that seems too good to be true.<br /><br />As a vendor, I have used freedomfinancial to cash out coins and referred over 10 buyers to them.

				I am a new buyer here with just a few smallish transactions so far. I FE&#039;d my first 2 small buys as I was willing to risk the cash after checking out the vendors. I figured it was a reasonable expectation of the vendor asking me to FE considering I had not made any and then only one buy on SR. Someone has to get the trust ball rolling and I needed them more than they needed me I figured.<br /><br />Now I have a few transactions under my belt and my first decent ($480) buy without FE&#039;ing which I finalized as soon as it arrived, I feel confident vendors will let me keep funds in escrow until product arrives now if they look at my buyer stats. My rule is to finalize the same day it is received, usually after sampling if possible. If a vendor insists on FE then I will keep searching for another buyer. I believe I have proven myself trustworthy enough to not justifying FE&#039;ing<br /><br />When I discover a vendor who provides quality I&#039;m happy with &amp; suitable stealth I plan to stick with them and keep them happy by finalizing as soon as it arrives and is sampled, hopefully that will translate into a good relationship resulting in becoming a &quot;trusted buyer&quot; in their eyes and hopefully the perks that come with that.<br /><br />I havent made any OS buys yet but hopefully I can find a good one who will let me keep funds in escrow, if not, I will be thoroughly researching that vendor before making a sample buy.<br />

				1. Dude, just find an online seller of bitcoins from localbitcoin.com<br /><br />2. Choose a vendor that accepts cash deposit via bank. <br /><br />3. Send them the amount. Then funds are placed in your localbitcoin wallet in 5 minutes tops!<br /><br />Easy as 1,2,3<br /><br />p.s. it really is that simple!

				If you still have the original money pak and receipt you can call Greendot and tell them you didn&#039;t giv the number to anyone but you&#039;ve been unable to use it.

				And I would like to add, that since there isn&#039;t really any way to keep the endless throngs of thieves from popping up under different usernames and taking customer&#039;s moneypaks - at the very least try to always do the following when ordering BTC with a green dot moneypak:<br /><br />Make certain that you place an ORDER thru the seller&#039;s ad (and do NOT send the MP with the order)<br />Ask them to FINALIZE before you give them the MP number.&nbsp; That way you are at least guaranteed feedback rights.<br />What really bothers me is the fact that a lot of fake coin vendors are cancelling people&#039;s orders and stealing the money off their moneypaks, avoiding negative feedback from the customer, and keep their scam going WAY longer than it should.<br /><br />Also, PLEASE report any theft to SR admin as soon as it happens!&nbsp; And post it on the boards!<br />This will keep SR a little safer, and may save others from getting taken for their hard-earned money!<br /><br />- BTCpal

				guys. it&#039;s really simple. localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; Either a face to face transaction, or some sort of escrowed transaction. I am a member of localbitcoins.com and SR, and if you want to buy a bitcoin, pm me, i&#039;ll walk you through it, sell you one if you like, and at market value. My username here is not my username on sr....I have been around since june 2011, so i&#039;m only going to do this for a select few, as I have only a couple btc available. First come, first serve. And to protect your privacy, i&#039;ll send you half on local btc and half on SR user to user. That will also eliminate the fees SR charges you from getting them uploaded. All transactions are instantaneous.<br />

Follow these instructions:<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Has this changed since the original post was in January? I read in several places that Mt. Gox is baaaaaaaad and not to use it. I&#039;m not trying to doubt you or whatnot, I am just new and trying to understand and stay safe at the same time. ;) Thanks for any feedback.

				Here&#039;s my experience w/bitcoin purchasing so far.&nbsp; First I signed up for coinbase.com and gave them way more financial information then I was comfortable with, like my username and password for my online bank account in order to maybe be allowed to get coins- after placing an order- the first time it worked.&nbsp; The second time I waited four business days to have my order cancelled at the last minute for some unknown reason.<br /><br />Personally, if your just buying a relatively small amount of bitcoins, say under $500 worth, I think you&#039;re much better off doing your research and buying from a legitimate seller on SR.&nbsp; I can personally vouch for BTC Boss.&nbsp; He was ridiculously fast back when he was still accepting moneypaks.&nbsp; He&#039;s def a trustworthy professional.&nbsp; Cheechdeals777 is still accepting moneypaks but only for under $250 worth..but he was super fast and nice too. There are definitely some good BTC vendors out there at any given time.&nbsp; They tend to come, go, reappear again pretty quickly from what I can tell.&nbsp; Just carefully do your research.&nbsp; Look at the feedback, the item page, and the sellers page carefully and really read what it says.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made the mistake of ordering too quickly before and luckily I didn&#039;t loose my money but I did waste more time then I was willing to spend waiting and ultimately cancelled the order anyway.

				Yeah, I always wonder why SR doesn&#039;t try to make it easier to get bitcoins by sponsoring vendors or just selling off some of their own through SR at times when they&#039;re especially hard to come by.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that I don&#039;t understand all this as well as they do but it seems like there must be something they could do to make it easier to get bitcoins and that it would be to everyone&#039;s advantage!

				I was going to use&nbsp; bit Instant but they been rebuilding their site for some time and they are in NY and I am on left coast.&nbsp; I investigated MTGOX but they are based in japan and but the big appeal for dealing with them is they have a huge base (over 50% of all USA bit coins) so when there is a small-med sell off their price doesn&#039;t drop so rapidly....&nbsp; But they only take deposits from a limited few choices..and the bank transfer option is waaaay too much imo.&nbsp; I finally went for Coin Base out of San Francisco...I saw their booth at the San Jose Bit coin conference and they are very good.&nbsp; Until you make it past the 30 day mark and had no problems they hold bit coin for 4 business days before you can send out but once you pass the 30 day mark and had successfully funded without a reversal then you can instantly buy up to 50 bit coins a day ready for immediate routing to your favorite venue.&nbsp; coinbase.com

				There are also some selective scammers working SR. They have super 5 star service but achieve this by asking for favors to new traders to FE.&nbsp; I broke that rule once.&nbsp; Never again.&nbsp; It seems that the FE has its advantages especially since you give your rating and can never change it: they get your money, you get nothing and they still are perfect.&nbsp; One vendor to watch out for is Haizenberg- where I gained this experience.<br />Asked me to do a favour for a bonus and FE, thought it was cool and did so, 23 days! later finally after some kind requests I received not what i ordered but a cheaper version that i could find at nearly half the price of what I was after. Bummer.&nbsp; Have asked him to make right by me but have not heard anything again from him in response. Gotta live and learn, so no FE...

				also before purchasing search vendors thoroughly through the forums. I had many successful orders before getting scammed. Thankgod it was for a very small amount (id never of ordered a large amount as he seemed questionable)<br /><br />however, i was lazy and didnt do my usual checks through the forums. If i had i prob would of saved myself $20....it pays to be extra vigilant.<br /><br />As for the FE scam, it shouldnt surprise anyone that someone would do that. Never FE!

There are multiple ways to purchase them as well so you should find one you like. I&#039;ve stuck to using PingIt from barclays, As its super easy to use with your smartphone. As with most sites there is a chance of being scammed, just never &quot;complete&quot; the trade till the BTCs are showing up in your wallet.<br /><br />Once they are in my Bitbargain wallet, i transfer them to a blockchain wallet (bitbargain Tax you 5% IIRC a week to keep BTCs stored) and then from there to my SR account.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />D

				I just wanted to say I just bought Bitcoins from LocalBitCoins.com, the service is very convenient just went to BoA and deposited money into an account and the teller asked me no questions and was very anonymous! It took maybe little over an hour and my Bitcoins were available. I did research this in security so my reference to this service has been stated before but can never be overstated IMHO.

				localbitcoins.com is the easiest and quickest way to obtain BTC at the moment. Probably the most anonymous as well. You just create an account (no personal info required) and look for a seller who has the amount of BTC you need and accepts a payment that works for you. There are users that offer many payment options such as bank cash deposit and moneypak, westernunion, moneygram, paypal, and cash in the mail (if you send cash in the mail be sure to wrap it in several layers of carbon paper (available online, Staples, and Office Depot, probably other office supply stores. If is technically illegal to send cash in the mail unless I&#039;m incorrect.)<br /><br />I recently used the site, used my phone to access the site, looked for someone who was online recently, send a request and the seller responded in one minute asking which bank I wanted to use (he accepted multiple banks.) After I responded, he replied 3 - 5 minutes later with the account info for the deposit. I ran to the bank, deposited the money with no questions asked and no suspicious looks. I had the bitcoins within minutes of marking paid and was able to send to SR in under an hour total. I won&#039;t use any other service unless they shut down.

				Hello 2 The Great People Of Silk Road,<br /><br />&nbsp;I am new to the Road, made three small transactions to give it a run. Everything was perfect! I was given a loan of 10+ BTC to make a purchase from KQUEEN. After researching multiple Ketamine vendors it was clear that all requested to FE.&nbsp; K Queen stats seemed flawless with great prices. So I decided to give KQueen my trust.<br /><br />&nbsp;As soon as I placed order KQueen responded immediately requesting me to FE or my order will not be dispatched. <br /><br />I replied: The Silk Road Wiki says never to FE.<br /><br />&nbsp;KQueen replied:&nbsp; &quot;yes, well we are reputable and have been here for a long time, we only ask this for maybe another 6/7 days due to severe cash flow issues we are having.&quot;<br /><br />I replied :So should I wait 6-7 days. I seriously can not afford to take a loss like this on borrowed money.<br /><br />K Queen replied: &quot;you have to finalize your order otherwise we will not dispatch.<br />these are our conditions we&#039;re afraid, same for everyone.&quot; <br /><br />My dumb ass working with loaned cash replied: Ok you got it! How could I not trust the K Queen? You got all you need, as you mentioned by the end of next week it will arrive. <br /><br />6-7 days go by and long behold no delivery of 10+BTC order and K Queen vendor page is shut down RIP.<br />I attempted in good faith on K Queen discussion board to advise people to keep things clean and diplomatic. Wrong move after reading what older members posted in forums. Check it for your self why. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I fell down the stairs and broke a few ribs... Hope that covers the loan.<br /><br />To sum it up NEW MEMBERS! Strictly follow the information of the Silk Road Wiki. If FE is requested, if a deal seems to good to be true then screw it~~ON 2 THE NEXT ONE!<br /><br />If by any chance Kqueen K Queen reads this post I beg you to please return my 10+BTC<br /><br /><br />This is my true experience, and I brought it on myself, NEVER FE EARLY THE SILK ROAD WIKI IS THE GOLDEN GRAIL! <br /><br />Live Learn Love Give

				I can&#039;t speak for everyone, but its I believe its safe to say a lot of us when were new to this get scammed at some point. Unfortunately it happens to when we are new to this or get desperate in our buying for whatever reasons. I&#039;ve only FE once and of course got scammed by dopeman. But that is neither here nor there. Just as in the &quot;real world&quot; of buying our products and taking risks the same applies here. Never forget there are always people looking to prey on the vunerable.

But those kind of transactions are what other (not jmb) people set you&nbsp; up for. They spend time on here, get to the guys needing to move large amounts of cash, and when they reach whatever their magic number is they jet from the scene or setup under a different vendor account. <br />Remember this is actually outside the rules of SR and could potentially get you banned. Also, just from my perspective as a vendor I&#039;d actually be scared of doing transactions that way because the feds can mark them bills and set you up on a RICO or money laundering racket.

				Those bitcoin scams don&#039;t stop there. They continue onto the road as well (not sure if any of that has been mentioned, didn&#039;t read many of the posts). However, this is the exact reason why I made this vendor account. I&#039;m just as sick of those bitcoin exchange scams as the next person and therefore am now doing it myself.

				Got an email offering the chance to buy some of 250 $200 0.1% stakes in the company profit.<br />They estimated the monthly road profit at $100-$200k per month and would pay out a quarterly total of 2.5% of that.<br />I saw elsewhere on the forums that this is a scam. Here was the biggest clue: 250*0.1%=25%=!2.5%<br />Insult my intelligence while you insult my intelligence why don&#039;t you.<br /><br />If something looks too good to be true, stop and think about it.
