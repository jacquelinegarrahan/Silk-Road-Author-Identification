				Seller bearfoot set up a custom listing for me for a larger quantity at a overall discount that would equal 4 free pills. Pills arrived overnight as promised. I open my pills to get faster absorption in mouth, and the first pill was familiar in taste and produced desired result. The second was the same. The third capsule was squishy and after tasting, proved to be not the same whatsoever. I then examined remaining pills and discovered three more that were loose fitting. I dumped all three on a piece of paper next to a tightly filled one and found that the color of the loose one was off white compared to bright white. Upon examining further the powder in the opened pills was flour. Seller denied and refused partial refund or replacement. <br /><br />Seller has no other items for sale since, except for lotteries. So beware of this lottery as you are most likely playing a rigged game. Proceed with caution. <br /><br />I have many thousands spent over 13 months with no auto finalized transactions, or negative buying stats of any kind. I have no interest in anything but people conducting professional business in a positive and helpful communal manner.

				This is ridiculous.&nbsp; I&#039;ve simply asked for you to show me some kind of proof that the pills were not filled correctly.&nbsp; I am confident in my sources and have not scammed any other buyers, so how am I supposed to just refund you without evidence that you&#039;ve been wronged?&nbsp; Something tells me you don&#039;t have the proof...
