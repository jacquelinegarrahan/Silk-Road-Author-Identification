				They&#039;re all reasonably similar, though I think 25c-NBOMe is more effective at lower amounts

If you plan to eat it orally in a pill, or just a shard, i would advise just a bit more. About 10-15mg ingested orally. Best of luck to you.

TBH, far to many reasons why i cant stand them.. and thats just me, i can not speak for others either of coarse. <br /><br />Just save your money man, how ever long it may take, and go for some L. I wouldnt consider any other options.

				Not even worth it at the low price tag? I planned on flipping enough of it to make my money back (won&#039;t be selling it as acid because i&#039;m not an asshole) so a ton of free trips just seems so tempting...<br /><br />&nbsp;On another note, I think I just had legit L for the first time this past weekend. White, un-perforated and tasteless blotter.<br />$10/hit and 1 had me tripping pretty hard. However, the price point seems odd to me.&nbsp; I imagine anyone I&#039;m buying psychedelics from gets their supply from the road, and looking at the current acid prices, $10/hit doesn&#039;t make sense. It looked exactly like this (clearnet): http://files.shroomery.org/files/05-14/306171897-scan0001.jpg

				Definitely 25i, in my opinion. I&#039;m fully aware some don&#039;t like it, and don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ll take L over that shit any day, but the trip that 25i gives you is fucking amazing. Just my opinion

				I can recommend 25i. Some people don&#039;t like it, but I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences. 1000mg is a sweet spot for me, I get an intense but enjoyable trip. Start with a low dose and see if it&#039;s something you like.
