				Hello friends, I am a newbie and I have a question about XTC/MDMA.<br /><br />I made my first order 2 weeks ago. I ordered 5 XTC. One pill has 110 mg. I never had experience with XTC/MDMA before. <br /><br />I take LSD 8-10 times per year. <br />10 days ago I took LSD with my friend. Then we came to my flat. I have heard other people speaking about this great combination:LSD + XTC<br />I think 3 hours later I drop one XTC pill. It was like paradise, LSD together with XTC. 2 hours after it, I drop another XTC pill. Same did my friend. We had a great night and I think we were both really high. We like our new experience : LSD+XTC<br /><br />Yesterday I take in the morning the last XTC pill. The effects come in 1,5 hours and I dont feel a lot. In some moment I realise I like what I feel and what I see. This feeling is may be 1 hour, but not very strong. <br />After it I get every 15-20 minutes very unpleasant and not comfortable feeling inside of my body, it feels like all is gone and lost, it also feels like this on physical level. Very unpleasant... like poison in a certain way. I get this feeling within a period of 2 hours, like I say every 15-20 minutes for a very short time, may be 2 minutes, after it all is again fine. <br />Later starts another problem. I want to pee every 15-20 minutes. This problem I have from 12 am till 6pm. And the urine is white like water. Besides I feel really irritated, a bit sick, in my mouth and my stomach a bad feeling, my tongue looks very white and dry. It feels very unpleasant in the body. <br />Later comes my friend and we smoke marihuana. After smoking I feel quiet good, almost ok. This unplesant feeling in my body does not disturb me anymore so much like in the beginning. In the evening we smoke again and after it I go to bed and sleep. <br />Today I feel a bit tired, but my mood is good.<br /><br />MY QUESTION - : <br />does it always feel like this after XTC? <br />Or is my XTC pill not good quality?<br />What can help to stop the XTC bad feeling? sleeping pills? Marihuana was quiet good helping me.<br /><br />I heard a lot of good stories about XTC/MDMA and I want to experience this great feeling.<br />Is it may be better to order pure MDMA next time because it may be cleaner than XTC pill?<br /><br />Please, give a good advice<br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br />

				I think also my serotonin was down and may be the pill was shit<br /><br />but remember when I took LSD and after it 2 XTC pills, it felt like heaven. I dont understand then.<br /><br />And what about MDMA? is it safer to buy it and to see that it is cleaner than XTC pill?

				Yup the seratonin levels is one thing, but as for the constant peeing, (this is my guess)<br />Drinking lots of coffee makes you urinate a lot, i&#039;m guessing this is because of the caffeine<br /><br />If so, your pill must contain quite lot of caffeine powder, which sometimes too much caffeine can<br />give you the shakes and lots of urinating! <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if i&#039;m right but this is my assumption, better to space your time between you last took ecstasy for a month I feel,<br />but if you&#039;re eager to take it again and can&#039;t wait, I suggest eat a lot, if you have the money buy some 5HTP supplements Or just eat<br />healthy, green tea for antioxidants, bananas, any fruits for their vitamins, and you might be alright to take it for the next weekend!<br /><br />I was so eager after popping a pill of 200-220mg mdma, the next day I popped my last one and didn&#039;t get the feelings<br />to last long... thats me being impatient &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; <br /><br />MDMA is just amazing huh? easy come easy go haha

				@HEARTS<br /><br />thank you for the good answer.<br /><br />I think the pill was cut with some unclean shit. Probably you are right about urinating and caffeine in the pill.<br /><br />But what about MDMA? is there a bigger chance that it can be cleaner than XTC pill and thus less unpleasant feeling afterwards?<br /><br />Ah, any thought about come downs? marihuana is good and helped me. what else? sleeping pills like valium?<br /><br />Peace

Also I guess even 10 days can&#039;t make the ecstasy high that strong as you noticed, you&#039;d have to take a larger amount in order to.<br /><br />Umm as for comedowns, I don&#039;t have experience in any other substances to relax with after ecstasy except marijuana :P Always nice to take a bongshot or a joint right after to help sleep or relax! Since there could have been amphetamines in the pill. Umm I&#039;ve never actually used valium but its a benzo so it should work as well!<br />I&#039;d stick to Weed though just to be on the safe side, but I don&#039;t think a little valium will do any harm i&#039;m sure, just to get some rest! <br /><br />Ugh out of anything to get high on, waiting for some 25i NBOME&#039;s coming on monday I think :s<br /><br />Ohh I forgot to add, if you want to get good ecstasy pills, Check out Schizofreen&#039;s vendor page, He&#039;s got a wide variety, I&#039;ve tried his Mortal Kombats and they were just amazing! He also sells MDMA crystals, his prices are very very reasonable and quality! He&#039;s based in Netherlands.<br />Here&#039;s his page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2c0321b45c

In theory anything can be in powder and anything can be in a pill. If I buy a large batch I always get it lab tested with the anonymous service provided by erowid/ecstasydata.org -- it&#039;s fantastic, but pricy. ($140 for a powder sample.)<br /><br />In practice, I&#039;ve found powder to be more reliably pure MDMA than pills. Some of the batches I have received have been cut with MSM, which is mostly harmless and just reduces the potency. Scroll through the reports on ecstasydata.org and see if you can find a match for the pills you bought -- it could be that someone else sent one in for testing.<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING:<br /><br />A pill with MDMA and caffeine at a 12:1 ratio: http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2765<br />A powder sample that 100% Methylone, but was sold as MDMA: http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2757<br /><br />It&#039;s just a couple of examples, but as you scroll through the list, you&#039;ll be alarmed at how many things sold as &quot;Ecstasy&quot; have very little (or NO) MDMA at all. Sad state of affairs that prohibition brings us to.<br /><br />The last pill you took sounds like it could have been something else, but I would be surprised if *some* of the pills you had were legit and one was not. Don&#039;t underestimate the power that overdoing it with MDMA can have on your body and its ability to make you feel like shit. Seriously... It&#039;s intense... I would suggest waiting 1-3 months between rolling, if at all possible, and maybe longer. It&#039;s such an amazing time. Don&#039;t blow out your brain and lose the magic...

				You&#039;re serotonin levels are depleted. Believe it or not, serotonin is also affected when you take other drugs such as LSD, weed, alcohol, etc. <br /><br />MDMA works differently by releasing your serotonin in vast quantities. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter used in regulating mood, sleep, memory, appetite, along with other brain functions.<br /><br />Imagine your normal serotonin levels are like a dam with a lot of water. When you take MDMA, the dam is released, and your brain is flooded with serotonin beyond what it is normally used to in its regulated pathways. This causes the extreme happiness that you feel, along with that intense feeling of intimacy.<br /><br />Do realize that when your &quot;dam&quot; is released, it takes awhile to refill the reservoir. Sleep, a healthy diet, and just getting rest will slowly refill your serotonin levels. <br /><br />I would wait at least a week, better for 2 weeks, before rolling face again.<br /><br />You should always stick with MDMA in powder form imo, because pills can be cut with adulterants.

				@ youcanttouchthis<br />&nbsp;- GHB??? Never heard. Must check wikipedia<br /><br />@Hearts<br />&nbsp;- Thank you for answer. But there is also chance to buy MDMA in crystal and wash it with aceton and all this ingredients. It only sounds so complicated. But as I say, everyone (me as well) want to have a pure enjoyeble high with as less as possible negative effects. May be I need to research a bit this topic how to clean and wash MDMA and so on. I love pure and clean LSD, I also tried 3 times really pure and potent cocaine with no comedowns, really nothing bad, just good mood when the effect is over. So in the same way I want to try MDMA to have after it a good memory and to enjoy the trip))<br />25i NBOME?? I heard it is a bit like LSD but never tried it. Please describe if possible later your trip&nbsp; :)<br /><br />@godness240<br />&nbsp;- I did not know that MDMA can be like acid. also depending from the mood. I did not know it can bring you in bad mood.....Good to know<br /><br />@csillag<br />&nbsp;- thank you, it is a interesting info. I suppose a lot of vendors cut their products with something. it is sad anyway&nbsp; :(<br /><br />@grizzbrah<br />&nbsp;- I plan I wait some months before I roll next time. In this periode I want to research about MDMA, all the techniques, good and bad experiences and so on. I understand it like this that in crystals it may be the cleanest but no one can guarantee it. I wrote also above to @Hearts, where I say that I would love to experience this one time of MDMA when all is just pure magic. When I took it last week after LSD it felt like paradise, but now I believe LSD could just mask some negative effects of it. When I tried it without LSD it was most of the time quiet unpleasant<br /><br />@cannamanuk<br />&nbsp;- no, it was not Bentley, it was Toyota<br />&nbsp;- sorry , what is EZtest????<br />

				Niki.. i&#039;ve had bought several mdma&#039;s from here... and once, i ordered a 84% mdma.. very good, i fucking rocked in that party.. but at the same time i was rocking on the dance floor, one experienced friend mine, was almost dying because of the mdma.. and he took the same mdma of me, and even in a lower dose. he was on the rave party for 2 days and he was tired.. and i was fresh, arrived oh that day.<br /><br />please dont take mdma when you are tired or feeling bad.. a bad trip of mdma is very very very bad. you just puke and puke, and puke , and you puke air and bubbles, you stay without any strength on the body and you feel like you are dying, really. the only thing that i know that cures the mdma trip, it&#039;s speed<br /><br />when you know someone that it&#039;s really bad with the mdma, feeling rlly bad, just give him some speed and it will pass :)
