				I&#039;ve heard a lot of talk regarding the recent climb in bitcoin exchange rates. I&#039;d like to believe that it&#039;s because more people are actually using them vs a bunch of people speculating. But it seems like it was a combination of the two? Hopefully people will stop speculating, and actually start adopting the currency!!!! :D<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3

				Meh... Its very interesting, and lovely to see that my BTC that i recently bought is actually worth more...<br /><br />But at the same time it dosent matter cause the prices on sr adjust (usually?), although the actual reason as to why its on the rise dose concern me alil bit.

				i think it definitely effects sellers more. using this week as an example of course... holding onto money an extra week before cashing out can be a couple extra hundred depending on how busy the seller is.<br /><br />the value of bitcoin seems directly affected by the strength of the sites that use it. people dont care how much they pay for bitcoin because all they want are the goods/services. i noticed when SR was down in october that bitcoin was steady. turns out SR was down because so many new users were trying to access the system. at that point bitcoin was around $10.50

				Well it has reached $30 under worse circumstances. Now the supply is twice less (the block reward halving) and more sites adopted it, including wordpress (that&#039;s huge) so hitting $30 or beyond again shouldn&#039;t be impossible.<br />Or at least i wish so because the last time i bought significant quantities the price was $11.7 :)<br />

				Yes, even if they fall again, everyone here still has a use for them hence they will always have a value. In my opinion the only way the bcoin would actually lose value and not recover is if there was another way better, more efficient or what not coin that was somehow superior. Even then I believe bcoin would still be around even if it wasnt as valuable.

				Seems like a bubble for sure short term, but overall, I think BTC will continue to appreciate since supply is limited. The current bubble could collapse today, or it could keep going to 1000 - no one knows.&nbsp; I think any of us holding coins are going to be subject to short term volatility; maybe win or maybe lose.&nbsp; If you want to minimize risk, then don&#039;t hold any more BTC than you need for whatever you&#039;re buying soon. If you&#039;re holding more, then you&#039;re speculating in this BTC market.

				Economics tied to politics and sociology, confounded by psychology, is a volatile and unpredictable thing... Money is like the new particles in physics... everyone seems to know what will happen next, until it actually happens... but it still takes 100 years to really know what happened--and scientists never stop arguing about what happened.

				I&#039;ve noticed two things happening whenever bitcoins rise - by this I mean sharply and quicker than the general ascent.<br />I get fewer orders, buyers hold their coins hoping to gather more bang for their buck and savvy vendors switch to unhedged escrow.

				I love BTC, i like it as a currency<br />an investment, a way to get my fix!<br />and i think that more people will get to know about it everyday<br />and theyll start buying as well and therefore make the coins go up<br /><br />i think it will rise fairly steadily and once it hits a certain number(maybe 100usd)<br />it will skyrocket...and the more people buying them will only contribute to even more people buying them<br /><br />lets just hope theres nothing any government or hacker or anyone else can do to shut it down or slow it down.

				As far as I am aware, Litecoin has numerous benefits over bitcoin, including faster transaction times. <br /><br />In the short term I can&#039;t see bitcoin going below 75 any time soon. Although if the media have their way, I can see a fast adoption rate for litecoin...
