				Any information on the whereabouts of Chemicalcat? I placed a $400(US) order on Friday, paid an addition .52BTC &quot;highest priority express overnight shipping&quot;. I did not receive my order yesterday, the order still shows &quot;processing&quot;, and I have had no response to SR messages. <br />I&#039;m still relatively new, but my stats are flawless and I&#039;ve spent over $1200. <br /><br />Ideas?

				I would assume the vendor is really busy or something. If it says still processing that means the order hasn&#039;t been shipped, don&#039;t be expecting it till it&#039;s marked in transit.

				Also, I&#039;m not sure how it works in your country but in mine the postal system is mon-fri so I would realistically expect it to be shipped on the Monday.

				Still no word from Chemicalcat; no response to my messages even though profile states was last seen &quot;today&quot;, which would mean that he has logged into SR, correct? I cannot cancel the order myself until tomorrow (4 day wait period). Not happy.

				He was in a car wreck recently so sometimes it takes him a while to respond. He also mentions this on his seller page. I&#039;ve ordered from him once before and was very satisfied.<br /><br />That being said, I am having some other MoneyPak issues with him right now.. and it&#039;s been 2 days with no response. I&#039;m giving him the benefit of the doubt. For now.

				Just an update, he took a few days but did get back to me. The issue isn&#039;t fully resolved but he appears to want to work it out with me. <br /><br />Again, will update later when the issue is fully/actually resolved. At least he&#039;s communicating.

				Ive done 3 deals with him. All flawless no problems. Then last week I fucked up and sent him 6btc for a deal we agreed upon. I thought no problem this guy has been great even throws in extras every time. Ive spent about $2000 with him. He was even gonna send me a free sample he forgot to put in with an order. I told him don&#039;t worry about it get me next time. SO anyhow on the 10th after I sent him the 6btc I messaged him to make sure he got the transfer. He said yes I&#039;m getting your package out right now. 9 days later nothing and no response to several messages. I hope he&#039;s just haveing some computer issues or something and I will owe him a huge appology. But I have a bad feeling I learned my lesson the $600 hard way. DON&quot;T FUCKIN FE EVER!!!!
