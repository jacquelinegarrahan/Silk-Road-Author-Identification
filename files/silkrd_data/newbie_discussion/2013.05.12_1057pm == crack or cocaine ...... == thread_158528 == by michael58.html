				Years ago I was in a fairly serious auto accident and since then I have not been able to do cocaine in the conventional way. My nose just can&#039;t handle it the way it could prior to the accident and I don&#039;t have the balls to go to the Doc and say&nbsp; ..... Hey WTF I can&#039;t snort coke anymore whats up with that. I haven&#039;t tried crack yet but am willing to give it a shot as I love coke and the effects it produces. Would I be better off buying the finished product or would it be better to buy raw coke and cook it up myself. Those who chime in about coking it up myself might want to include some very basic instructions on the easiest most effective way to do so.

				I would not recommend rocking it up, you will most likely fail the first few times and end up wasting a lot. If you have coke, try a foily. You get 2 parts coke, 1 part baking soda, add a drop of water, swirl it around on tin foil, light from the bottom and it&#039;s insta crack, but no where as strong.

				I&#039;m fairly certain information on how to produce crack cocaine from cocaine is available on the clearnet. I believe all equipment/chemicals involved (besides the cocaine) are OTC.<br /><br />It&#039;s your decision, what you want to do. There&#039;s always the option of not doing any drugs like cocaine or crack cocaine at all; addiction is a difficult road to go down, and usually ends up in one of a few places (all not so good). Also, as far as I know, crack is not a drug that is able to be done in moderation. It&#039;s one of the most addictive mind-altering substances we know of. I&#039;d say don&#039;t get involved, but it&#039;s really irrelevant to me whether you do or don&#039;t. However, objectively, if your goal is physical and mental well-being, don&#039;t do it. If it were a choice between crack (100mg once a day) and being constantly stoned out of your mind all the time, I&#039;d even settle for the latter. At least you can get off it of your own volition, and at least you can operate relatively properly as a human being while on it. So assuming you don&#039;t enjoy sabotaging yourself in pretty much every way imaginable, I would not do it.

				AS I posted earlier ..... I have tried coke ..... liked it ( REALLY liked it ) ..... and never had a problem saying NO ......... got a life and good job and want to keep it that way. I have heard that the high you get from crack is much more intense but would find it hard to believe that saying NO to crack when its time to say NO wouldn&#039;t be any harder than saying no to the conventional stuff. I feel fortunate not to have an addictive personality. I enjoy the gambit Gambling, alcohol. drugs (selectively ) but won&#039;t trade my life for any of the fore mentioned. Thanks guys for the input ......

				Just be prepared to be fiending. You will want another hit every 10 minutes, and that is something that can interfere with having a &quot;normal good life&quot;

				Ronnie ..... you are probably right ....... I look at doing drugs like gambling .......I never take any more money thru the front door of a casino than I can reasonably afford to lose. So I kind of try and figure out what I will need for the weekend and won&#039;t chase. This is one of the things I like about doing business on SR. Place the order on Monday and enjoy the weekend. I absolutely don&#039;t do any drugs Sunday thru Thursday ...... wheres the fun in staying high all week and what do you have to look forward to come Friday night if you have been high all week .&nbsp; Thanks to the poster that posted the instructions I may just find a reliable vendor and buy a little rock to try. Ronnies point might be don&#039;t worry about Sat cuz it&#039;s gonna be gone Fri ..... intersting !
