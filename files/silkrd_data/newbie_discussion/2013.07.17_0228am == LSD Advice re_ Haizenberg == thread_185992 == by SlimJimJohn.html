				I&#039;m in my early 50s.&nbsp; I last did Lucy in college - windowpane - sugar cubes with pretty awesome liquid drops - microdots, etc etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s been a very long time.&nbsp; I have done shrooms on occasion - but nothing too intense - and definitely not Lucy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been a life-long fan of the early incarnation of Genesis.&nbsp; The old stuff with Peter Gabriel - before Phil Collins shit all over it.&nbsp; Recently, the lead guitarist from the early days, Steve Hackett, has put together a band that plays all the early material - and they nail it.&nbsp; Apparently he&#039;s pulled together some amazing studio musicians who are good as, if not exceed, the playing abilities of the original lineup.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought his recent CD called &quot;Genesis Revisited II&quot; - and i am pretty fairly impressed - and i am a pretty big snob when it comes to music.<br /><br />So, Steve Hackett is touring and I&#039;ve got tickets to see this amazing lineup in late September.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is probably the last chance I&#039;m ever going to have to see this music performed live - with integrity - in a kick-ass venue with the full lightshow and videos etc etc.<br /><br />i decided to take Lucy with my wife for the show.&nbsp; I want it to be really special.&nbsp; This is a one time thing and I want it to great.<br /><br />I purchased two 100uG tabs from Haizenberg.&nbsp; He seems to have pretty good reviews - his stuff is tested - and most of the star vendors on the Avenger&#039;s list either won&#039;t sell to a newbie - won&#039;t ship to the USA - or are currently out of stock.<br /><br />question:&nbsp; given my age and the decades that have passed since taking Lucy - would a tab of 100uG be too much?&nbsp; Should i split one tab with my wife?<br /><br />Just how high should i expect to get?<br /><br />I know most of you probably have pretty high tolerance for the stuff at this point.&nbsp; But - again - it&#039;s been decades and i do not want to spend the concert under my seat.<br /><br />1 tab or 1/2 a tab?

				I took his tabs for my first time on LSD, I think I even had the high potency gandalf prints, 1 tab was totally manageable. Just don&#039;t stress out about it, enjoy the show and find a friend to drive you home ;)

				I&#039;d say one tab would be fine, you will more then likely been in a nice sweet spot, a clean trip which you can manage and enjoy the music.<br />Hope you and the wife enjoy the show chap, let us know how it goes, I&#039;m always intrigued on how stories end!<br /><br />PlanB 8)

				I think 100ug is a pretty standard dose even for first-timers, so considering you at least have a pretty good idea of what to expect, 100ug should be no problem for you. I shouldn&#039;t say this, but think of it from the other side- you wouldn&#039;t want to dose too low and be disappointed on such a special occasion, would you? <br /><br />Enjoy, and let us know how it goes. I will be experiencing my first trip on one of Haizenberg&#039;s hoffman blotters as well, in the next while here.

				Thanks for the feedback all - I ordered 2 tabs so I think we&#039;ll take 1 each.&nbsp; The show is in september so I guess I&#039;ll keep them in the freezer until then.&nbsp; I let you know how it goes.
