				Hey<br />So I am really excited to bang the only water soluble benzo, and I was simply looking for some guidance.&nbsp; I will be breaking my rule of never breaking the skin on this one, however I&nbsp; have got to know.<br /><br />So please some simple guidance as to how to take the pill and convert it into a shot would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I have never coked and or shot anything, but my benzo tolerance is stupid high, and I&#039;d like to feel this before I ween off.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />

				Dissolve it in some water, measure it out volumetrically, inject it? I dunno anything about injecting anything though.<br /><br />When I was 15 or 16 I said I would never pay for drugs (that obviously didn&#039;t last long) but I still maintain that I&#039;ll never pay for coke. Good luck with your tolerance issues, man.

				Whatever.&nbsp; I&#039;ll always wake up, and give you the best damn service you&#039;ve ever had my restaurant.<br /><br />If I could bang this shit I would, it&#039;s just the math of of the dissolving mg - ml, and what my solvent is. So fuck it, I eat em, like a man with out a sense of adventure, which is no man at all. Emasculated emoticon.

				Fuckin&#039; Bruce man, I spit my coffee out on my monitor at the Darwin Award comment..<br /><br />Good advice too. It&#039;s actually a bad idea to even snort pills isn&#039;t it? But I hear that people do all the time.

				First, you don&#039;t. But when you do, you remove the coating from the tablets, crush them into a fine powder, dissolve in sterile water, and boil the water over a lighter flame before loading it into a syringe equipped with a micron filter. Don&#039;t worry about what doesn&#039;t dissolve; the bulk of the pill is not midazolam (but you can go ahead and eat it &#039;just in case&#039;). After you inject it, you lose consciousness for about a minute. Then you repeat the process beginning with step one, you don&#039;t.

				I dont think any of you have any real idea of what youre talking about.&nbsp; First off, my man Bruce, thats why midazolam is different.&nbsp; It is water solluble, and can be snorted.&nbsp; Therefore it can be banged.&nbsp; Dude talking about cooking the shit Im not sure, I think adding heat would subtract from potency, Im not admittedly not sure, and if I were to do it, I&#039;d&nbsp; be inclined to treat them like a shaker.<br /><br />Thats my two cents on a fictional future occurrence
