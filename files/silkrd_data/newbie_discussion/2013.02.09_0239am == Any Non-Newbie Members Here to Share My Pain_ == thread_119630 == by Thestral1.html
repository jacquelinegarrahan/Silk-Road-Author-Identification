				I can understand how you feel since the same happened to me!<br /><br />I think that it would still be worth reporting that scam in the Newbie Section, there&#039;s quite a high chance that it will be read and word will spread about it.<br /><br /><br />I wish you the best of luck with any other order you might do on SR

Such as when you send your address during the order process, for example. That way if SR became compromised the only person that could see your shipping address would be your vendor (they delete your address upon shipping, but it also helps to become friendly with your vendor as well). I&#039;ll occasionally encrypt messages to vendors in SR if it contains sensitive info, such as anything that could even roughly pinpoint the area I live or personal details about myself.

				Yea I agree I only post when I have my first interaction with a vendor and when I have a successfull delivery. No need to get chit chatty just be to the point. <br /><br /><br />anyway to everyone involved. PLEASE understand cash laws in your country and how much total (not per but total in 30 days) is a safe limit for you to not to exceed per month.<br /><br />Easiest way to get busted is sending to much cash at once be patient! plan ahead

				Veta,<br /><br />Some people are going to give me grief over this advice, but I think I know where you&#039;re coming from getting dollars turned into BitCoins is a pain in the ass when you&#039;re just starting out.&nbsp; I&#039;m at the 2-week mark, and I am *almost* to the point where I can do a Dwolla exchange directly into a Mt. Gox account.<br /><br />In the meantime, I&#039;ve placed 6 orders by funding my BC address using bitinstant.com.&nbsp; The downside is that it costs about $8 in fees per transfer.&nbsp; The upside is that it&#039;s quick - you take the money to freaking Wal-Mart (or one of many other places), do a money transfer, and the address is funded within the hour.&nbsp; After that, it takes between 2 and 4 hours for SR to catch up.&nbsp; If it hadn&#039;t been for bitinstant, I would still be sitting around waiting for accounts to verify and clear.

I&#039;ve been on SR around 7 or 8 months and this came as a shock when I tried to write up a review last night for a vendor that went above and beyond for me. <br /><br />I know there are legitimate reasons for the new rule, so I&#039;ll play (like I have a choice). I wouldn&#039;t even mind if Tor isn&#039;t slow as molasses, but it&#039;s a necessary evil for the security. And I&#039;ll take that tradeoff any day. So it looks like I&#039;ll be talkative (typeative?) for a little while.<br /><br />For all of the newbies: welcome aboard!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; Use PGP and do your research on EVERYTING - anonymous ways of buying bitcoins, delivery options, booting from a thumb drive (not crucial but there are plenty of ways to further protect yourself), etc. It will pay off in spades, the most important of which is keeping you safe.<br /><br />For all of you scammers: go fuck yourselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thestral1, you&#039;re hard to catch. You dont come in here much. I&#039;ll talk to you later but you probably won&#039;t read this so I won&#039;t actually write anything on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I come in here more than one would think, I just don&#039;t post a lot. I&#039;m also careful about spending too much time on Tor. But you caught me! Now I&#039;m intrigued to hear what you wanted to say...

I know a couple of vendors who are (were) in the same predicament and they weren&#039;t happy. Oh well, 50 isn&#039;t that bad. Of course it&#039;s easy for me to say since I just made my quota. You&#039;ll be there in no time.
