				I just noticed AfterHour has disappeared.<br />Well if he got caught that&#039;s a shame.<br /><br />I never ordered from him, but I was planning to in the future.<br />Heard so many good things about them too.<br /><br />The worst part is that someone will have to spend a long time in jail for a victimless crime.&nbsp; :(

				the lesson here is that if you&#039;re a successful vendor on sr perhaps it&#039;s best to stick to sr and ditch offline vending. despite all the paranoia it&#039;s extremely unlikely to get caught solely for vending here even if you&#039;re in the top 1%

				Poor guy, bought from him a few times and he was a great vendor! Seemed like he began slipping up towards the end of his time at SR though, maybe he was getting sloppy and thats why he or they ended up getting caught!
