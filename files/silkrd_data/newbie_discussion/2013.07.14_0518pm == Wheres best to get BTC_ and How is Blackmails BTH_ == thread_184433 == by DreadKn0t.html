				I am about to try out localbitcoins tomorrow.&nbsp; My plan is to go to my bank, and deposit x amount of $ in it.&nbsp; Then get on Dwolla and link my account to localbitcoins and make a purchase.&nbsp; Does this sound like a smart idea or are there other inexpensive ways of doing this?

The reason i was asking about blackmails black tar was because its a good price for the road i think and i personally have never tried black tar before, i hear the stuff can be VERY potent, yet also very dirty. now, for the most part ive been trying to keep my shit together and not be the way I was before because it just kept running me in the same circles when trying to find my path in life. i still take my subs and all that jazz, which really helps, however after extended periods of time i have without dope (like atleast a couple months or something) i bite the bullet and want to get high for one day and regardless of however i feel or however much cash i have the next day, i have taught myself just to hop right back on the sub routine without a thought of the blemish i put into my sobriety the day before, just so i can keep moving on with my life. SO what im getting at is, its been a little bit of time since the last time i decided to get high, but if im gonna spend the money on the stuff. i dont want to get too much, but i want to get something ive never had before &amp; hope its good stuff. so i appreciate your post, not to mention everyone else who has made their input on the bitcoin thing. the local bitcoin seems like a solid source, but ill be honest the whole meeting face to face thing makes me a little paranoid, idk why. and how does it exactly work? do they just take my cash and then go home and load them for me, or give me a code, or idk. someone fill me in on that if they dont mind cause i might decide using that even if it does take a little longer. i got time to spare, the waiting game is no rush for me on the road since i really only purchased lsd or herb on the road and thats nothing i sweat or jones over as long as i know its coming. and it is tempting to go through the vendors, and that is always the initial action that goes through my mind when trying to transfer cash to coin, but it kinda sickens me how some people with no respect not thinking about how people may have to earn their dollar and they will just burn you. then the fact SR administrators cant do anything about it is even more crazy! so those are reasons unless i hear really solid service of a vendor and a person whos personally used them i may check it out, otherwise i would like more info on local as well and know the mechanics behind it so i feel safe having to transact with someone random face to face, idk sorry for such a long post everyone. anyways, im out, if there are more posts ill respond! take care yall!<br />-DK

				They&#039;ve changed their policies.. it&#039;s not as simple as just setting up a cash deposit. They require a little background information about you now.
