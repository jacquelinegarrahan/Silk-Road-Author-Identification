Have had a couple hiccups, so things have been progressing slowly, but I have shown a small profit so it&#039;s all good considering how I started out with literally just 100 dollars. <br /><br />If there is any demand for psychedelics in your area, I would suggest investing in the NBOMe series, as they are cheap enough that you can pop them off for 10$ each while still making a tidy profit and at least 99% of people should be able to get at least a mild trip out of a single 1mg tab. Plus, they are much easier to move through customs than bulk weed, 100 tabs takes up as much space as a post it note. <br /><br />Good luck and welcome to the Road!

				Yo man, I&#039;m new to here too and I&#039;m in the same position. Being the middle man to try and turn a profit. As I&#039;m sure you know it is very rare to see anything in the UK even near to the quality of most the stuff on SR. Even the mid grade stuff you can buy on here cheap is good compared to the cheese in the UK. If you find the right seller, a big profit can be turned man. If you want message me and I&#039;ll tell you my favorite seller! Peace.

				I&#039;ve made money in the past buying bulk MDMA from European countries and selling it in the states. Very quick profit but be careful to not get too greedy. I haven&#039;t had a single 25gram package go missing or intercepted. <br /><br />NEVER tell people you are the one buying in bulk. Always give the impression you have to go &quot;pick-up&quot; the drugs from a friend first! Stay safe and use common sense. You can never be too careful and the dealers who last are the ones who are too paranoid to take unnecessary risks!

Do not try to lay/press your own tabs/pills, leave that to the experts. As I&#039;ve mentioned above, the NBOMe series is a good starter, and you can never go wrong with weed.

				Hi man, theres a guy called &quot;LaFuente&quot; I&#039;ll include the link to his page below. He offers an oz of midgrade for about £40 and offers a quarter of a kilo for just £200ish!!! Thats a big profit, and it means you can sell in oz&#039;s and still turn a profit rather than having to sell grams. Dont worry about the fact that its mid grade, its still better than most the stuff we get here. La fuente&#039;s rep went down for a bit, but it seems to be coming back now, and at that price, you cant complain! Let me know if you order, and tell me what you think. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/92626d1a47
