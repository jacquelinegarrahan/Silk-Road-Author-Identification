There&#039;s plenty of BitCoin scams out there. Sorry to hear you lost your money, but there&#039;s likely nothing that can be done to get it back. Did you give them your credit card information and credentials, as well? I would keep a close eye on your bank account for a little while, if so.<br /><br />Keep us posted on how this goes.

They are a scam and probably the #1 spammers here, which is the reason the 50 post rule came into existence<br /><br />Probably not the best time to scold you, but do a little research first. Do a simple search of &#039;silkroadtor&#039; here and you&#039;ll see that every post mentioning it says it&#039;s a scam. They also operate under various misspellings of legitimate exchanges, so be careful. (mt gix, virwix, bitcointalks, etc)

				@Doc Chronic<br /><br />Word. That is precisely what I am aiming not to do. I am gonna learn as much as I can about everything involved in this before I even consider diving in. Knowledge is power... but most people just wanna go ahead and get that order in the mail -.-
