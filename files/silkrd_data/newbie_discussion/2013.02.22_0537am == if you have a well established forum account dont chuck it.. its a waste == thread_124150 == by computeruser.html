				i tried meth last friday and became an instant addict, but the good thing about it was that all the numerous other drugs i like instantly became worthless to me.. its like ive reached the top.. no need for anythign else except meth.. and i have locked away the meth for 2 days and can hack it.. once per month debauchery seems ok.

				if anybody reads this one of the best things you can do for yourself if you want to moderate your supply is by a time delay safe to put your drugs in. ive got no way to touch whats in there atm and its working well so far.

				im gonna leave SR for the rest of the year and i got everything i need in my safe. it opens up either in a monthly or 3 weekly cycle. it all depends on how much meth ill be using during my &quot;day of debauchery&quot;. when i estimate that range sensibly i&#039;ll be able to rationally calculate how many months or 3 week cycles i will be able to last on the safe. at the moment ive got enoguh xanax to use for 2 years at 1 per month.. enoguh valium for 2 years at once per month or whatever.. i got 150grams of ghb powder.. dunno how the fuck im gonna be fucked using that.. incorporate that into my meth sessions. i also got 3 large doses of 2-cb. then i got the meth.. and it all depends on how much i can use in a meth session

				im on a low income and sick and tried of spending 500 bucks a pop on drugs. fortunately since i started meth last week ni no longer need mdma, 2-cb, ghb, lsd, weed blah blah supplies because all those drugs were just extra money. with my time locked safe and some fucken self control the meth will provide me with the best high and ill be using drugs less per month than ever.

				low income and wasting your life savings aay - spending 500 on mdma and then 500 on 2-cb and then 500 on blah blah blah.<br /><br /><br />will have possibly 5 grams of meth and if i use 0.5 grams per month in a single debauchery day that will last me.. holy shit.. only 10 months<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;well at least its better than needing all the other drugs

				when starting a meth session for a month ill be starting in teh morning. i&#039;ll see what proper plugging will do and hopefully i&#039;ll only need to use 2 points to be fucked up royally. then i can add some amyl nitrrite into that right away... when a few hours wears off i&#039;ll wack in one of my month viagra pills and smash out a gram or two of ghb and then maybe use a point or 2 as a smoking ROA.. so if all goes well maybe i&#039;ll only need 3 points for a day of debauchery per month but i think its going to be closer to 4 or 5 points
