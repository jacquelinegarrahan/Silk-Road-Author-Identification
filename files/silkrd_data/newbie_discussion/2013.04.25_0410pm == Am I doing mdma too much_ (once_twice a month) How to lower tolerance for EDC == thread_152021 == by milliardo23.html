				Ok so from 2010-11 I did it only like 6 times all my life<br /><br />But once 2013 started...<br /><br />Twice at NYE but they didn&#039;t do ANYTHING (ripped off)<br /><br />Once in January (2)<br /><br />Once in Feb (2)<br /><br />Once in March (2)<br /><br />Twice in April.... took 4 at a big event in april 6 (4 was the most I ever took in 1 night, usually only stay at 2 a night before that) Then one pill at a friends house on the 19th<br /><br />and planning to do it tomorrow...1-2 pills at a rave<br /><br />Is that too much in 1 month? Or should I just wait till june so I can lower my tolerance for EDC? I know I&#039;m not gonna do it in may so yeah... any opinions are appreciated<br /><br />Btw I&#039;m 5&#039;5 and weigh pretty average<br />

				I would stick to once a month, twice is overdoing it in my opinion. But really, it won&#039;t make a huge difference if you&#039;re leaving a couple weeks between each roll.<br /><br />Tolerance for seems to work like LSD, if you take a break for a couple of months it will go back to normal pretty much.

				Along with potentiating your Mollies, DXM, Ketamine, and Magnesium all serve to bring down your tolerance to amphetamines. I&#039;m a moderate Adderall user and this is how I ensure I keep taking only the minimum effective dose. It&#039;s all very technical, but here&#039;s a link if you care to read up on the subject. <br />http://www.addforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9575

				Take it easy there bud.&nbsp; If you start doing it too much your tolerance lowers and you kinda start resenting the roll.<br /><br />

				omg I&#039;ve been doing mdma multiple times a week for the last 2 or 3 months<br /><br />I really need to look into potentiating! I haven&#039;t had a noticeably weak roll yet, though. Maybe I&#039;m just bad at building up tolerance

				You&#039;re rolling far too often, you should really be awaiting at least 6-8 weeks between rolls. The thread I&#039;ve linked below gives some good information :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66048

				For a little while, I was doing it 3-4 times per month (~250mg each time) and that was definitely excessive. Lost some of the magic doing that.<br /><br />You can post-load with 5-HTP, that&#039;ll bring your seratonin levels back to normal a lot faster, but still, these days MDMA is for special occasions as far as I&#039;m concerned.

				What EDC are you going to? I took a break before I went for a long time cause I knew I was gonna roll a lot. I wouldn&#039;t roll until you go because you&#039;re gonna end up rolling for like 3 or 4 days in a row. Its awesome until like the week after when you&#039;ve lost 10 pounds and feel like shit.

You can cut a few days off that with 5-HTP.<br /><br />But honestly, the thing that kills it more than anything is the MDMA experience becoming routine. I know I have a vested interest in people doing this stuff all the time as I sell it, but for me it&#039;s a &quot;special occasions&quot; sort of drug. The experience is fantastic, but I&#039;d rather save it for times when I know I&#039;m really going to enjoy it.

				Everyone is different, but I&#039;m willing to bet a lot of people here have gone through binges on the stuff.&nbsp; I did for about a year, where I rolled pretty much every weekend and I came out ok.&nbsp; My only issue was that the tuesday blues got a little worse over time.&nbsp; Oh and I was taking really high doses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Definitely better every once in a while though IMO.&nbsp; I think the excitement of knowing you only are going to do it once or twice a year is part of the fun.

				<br /><br />No way, if you think you body can take it. Then its fine. You know your own body and mind better than anyone else. If you are still feeling positve in day to day life then no way is that excessive. I have gone through stages of doing in like 7 times every 8 weeks. Its cool

				When I first started, I was taking it about once every 4-6 weeks. Before a year was out I noticed that I started needing higher doses. <br /><br />I decided to take a 6 month break before I started to lose the magic. I now roll every 4-6 months and am able to have a solid roll every time.

				I&#039;ve been rolling every other week for a while (thanks to SR!) and have had no noticable side effects. But I&#039;m taking a month break for EDC Chicago...and then another month for EDC Vegas baby!! Can&#039;t freaking wait!<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten rolls from XTC Express which were SUPER strong. Yikes. I prefer the crystals though. Tesseract had the best domestic but he&#039;s in Stealth mode I think. Did not like MIMM&#039;s poder / crystals at all. <br /><br />Juergen&#039;s new tan is pretty damn good and can&#039;t beat the price. About $90 for 2 grams. Wish the domestic MDMA was cheaper....

				If you want to lower your tolerance quit taking it until EDC. Also you should only be taking it once a month MDMA is very nuro-toxic. But then again I have someone that buys MDMA from me every few days when they&#039;re in town and I know they use it every time they get it. &lt;- Don&#039;t be like that guy LOL.
