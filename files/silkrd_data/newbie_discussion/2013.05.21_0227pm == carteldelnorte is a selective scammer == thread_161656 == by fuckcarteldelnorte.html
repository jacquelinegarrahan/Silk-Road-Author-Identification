				I placed a small order that never arrived.&nbsp; Requests for tracking were either ignored or they tried blow me off by saying they will get back to me later and never did.&nbsp; I chose to finalize the order because the money means nothing to me and I will not waste time with resolution and fuck up my stats.&nbsp; It is what it is buddy - go ahead and order - some will win, some will loose.&nbsp;

				haven&#039;t received my package either, it&#039;s been more than two weeks. Also, and more worrying, he blatantly lied about the package being shipped (long story - I&#039;ll tell more when this is resolved). <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t order from him if I were you. <br />&nbsp;

				I placed a huge order. He was very prompt with communications and never asked me to FE. I am hoping to god he is legit because I already got beat by infinitesource for 300 bucks earlier this week when he lured me into fe because i only had 6 transactions. If I do not finalize early does that mean I will not be scammed? I had no issues with smaller transactions but now that i invest my hard earned coins its making me paranoid. I look for good deals so maybe this is why i am in the hot zone. Keeping fingers crossed will update the community with what I find. I paid for xpresspost mail to us so it should take about 7-15 days to reach me id imagine. 10 being typical.

				If you haven&#039;t finalized, you can still get your money in case he isn&#039;t on the level (which I don&#039;t know anything about), but it could have an impact on your buyer stats.

				i received a free sample essiantly his first week vending he is a very nice guy to deal with. he has had some canada post issues the last bit from what i can gather as there are people waiting up to 3 weeks for a package and 6 days for overnight. i am in the same boat but the vendor has agreed to reship me so hopefully it shows. all i can say is he seems legit jus super overrun and missing half the operation(health issues) be paitent and hopefully things work out

				I don&#039;t know about the scammer part, but I can tell you that I have not had a good experience thus far.. <br /><br />Shipping was SLOW even tho I paid for express it took over 12 days to get here... I just got a package from Canada from another vender and it took four days INCLUDING a weekend to get here.. So.. I know that was SUPER fast but 12+ DAYS COME ON!!!<br /><br />Product.. TOTAL Crap... I have sent him a message about this.. I want to give them a chance to explain before posting more about it.. One of the WORST experiences of my life I might add.. <br /><br />More to come.. one way or another from this..

I paid for express shipping and it STILL took 12 days to get here.. A normal 1st class postage letter / small pack from there takes 4 days to me counting a weekend (just had one come this past week) I have had normal CA mail take up to around a week before.. but NOT EXPRESS.. 12 days means he did not post it.. <br /><br />It tested as MDMA, I wrote a detailed review on it in the MDMA thread you can find it there.. If I had to guess (as thats all I can do now) is that it&#039;s PMA/ PMMA IF you have not heard of ether substance please go google it on the clear net.. NASTY SHIT<br /><br />&nbsp;I wont sell anything that I have not taken my self.. and this is exactly why! I can&#039;t sell this shit!&nbsp; Not only would I feel bad but it would ruin my name in the local community too! and OMG if it killed someone 0_o ...... I can live with the fact that I am, in deed , a drug dealer.. That fact alone does not make me a scum bag. I care about people and 90% of the people I deal to ARE my friends to some degree or another. I am careful about what I offer to sell them. I test each product first and always offer dosage information to them if they want it.. I know that I am not the norm, but I wish more people would be like me in this regard. <br /><br />I&#039;ve sent a few messages no reply&#039;s.. I don&#039;t think he cares any more..

				PMA seriously? I think I&#039;ll just ask for my $36 back and see where that gets me! What do you think is the story with the positive feedback he&#039;s been getting on his MDMA? Fake feedback?<br /><br />Being a drug dealer doesn&#039;t make you scumbag at all. We&#039;d be two scumbags united if that were the case! I&#039;m glad that there&#039;s other people than myself in this world that exercise some sort of safeguard for their customers!!

				I really don&#039;t know.. <br />Most of the feedback on SR is not exactly &quot;good&quot; there is a few that are still waiting per them, a bunch of FEs and a few Good stuffs....&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just tossing out there what my experience was.. And I think the largest glaring thing is the fact that he could have contacted me and we could have talked about this.. but he is ignoring me...<br /><br />I don&#039;t trust him or his product.. I have yet to have had anything truthful from him..
