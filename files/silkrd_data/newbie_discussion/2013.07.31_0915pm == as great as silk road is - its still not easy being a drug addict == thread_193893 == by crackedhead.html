				the waiting on the man for the drugs isnt any easier than it used to be back in the day...back then your man might make you wait a few hours or half a day.<br />These days....days can become weeks until you can get that next fix...thats even when you plan well.....i seem to run out and then theres the interceptions or non-arrivals<br />which arent easy to deal with - when your kind of dependent.<br /><br />in the past few months ive had<br />2g<br />1g<br />2g<br />3.5g<br />2.5g<br />1g<br />3.5g<br />1g<br />crack and meth orders not arrive - that i can remember....<br />these have been randomnly intercepted amongst my arrivals - perhaps i should give up!<br /><br />the problem is i rely on international as domestic isnt viable for me.... i would be bankrupt if i bought this shit domestically...........<br />not complaining just whinging - atleast the road has opened up the world to me.....just wish there was better way to get these drugs into my letter box and into me ----some sort of silk road drug running delivery service that by past customs... remote control hot air balloons perhaps...<br /><br />have they worked out how to teleport stuff yet? - if not i hope someone is working on it.<br /><br />ive been waiting 2 weeks now since my last order/binge arrived - i suppose it makes me healthier before i go again...,,.......i like to use some shit every day.<br />
