				If you stick to small amounts for personal, it should really be no issue. I don&#039;t see them investigating things under 5 grams and at most you would get a love letter and lose your package. If you are concerned, stick to domestic...it rarely fails.

				Its all about the stealth.<br /><br />I got 3 Packages opened from south america to western europe by customs. They never managed to find it. That was a few years back tho at a different market.

				As long as you research the vendor you want to buy from and make sure that they have good reviews and stealth, you should be fine. There are many reports of large quantities of mdma coming into the US from overseas without any problems thanks to the stealth these vendors use.

				even customs follow certain &quot;rules&quot; with regards to inspecting packages. And if you do your research, you&#039;ll find vendors who have got it down to the T.<br /><br />I&#039;m in Australia, apparently the toughest customs. Fuck that I only order International. 20g+ each time as well, I&#039;ve just had one order from Belgium delayed for about 30 days and waiting to recieve. Rest come through within a week or two.
