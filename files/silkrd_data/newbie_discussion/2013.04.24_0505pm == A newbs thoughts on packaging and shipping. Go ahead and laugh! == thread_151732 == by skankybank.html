				Alright, I just joined SR a few days ago, but that doesn&#039;t make me an amateur&nbsp; postal service or drug user. I&#039;ve been using them both for 30+ years, and haven&#039;t gotten arrested (well, not for drugs or mail fraud, anyway!)<br /><br />Living in France, and addicted to cheap Ebay shit from China, I&#039;ve noticed that not ONCE has any of my packages from China been opened. <br />I&#039;m still waiting for my my delivery from a SR vendor, so I have yet to gauge how they package things, but if they don&#039;t make the outside look like a cheap LED bulb in a box, maybe they might think about it? Small 8x8x8cm box, sealed with gobs of brown packing tape? <br />Of course the normal stealth odor-proof sealing ways inside would stay unchanged.<br /><br />I&#039;m only thinking out-loud here because I just read to be careful of ordering from Belgium, and guess where I ordered from??

				I rarely see people from France on the Internet, do you think that&#039;s because of the language barrier?&nbsp; I see lots of Swedes but then again they tend to know English better than most kids in the US.<br /><br />I also get a lot of shit from China (a big drug producing country) and AFAIK I&#039;ve never even had a package opened.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten very small packages, pretty big heavy boxes and pretty big light boxes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not one opened.&nbsp; That might be because of the particular customs point my stuff comes through though.
