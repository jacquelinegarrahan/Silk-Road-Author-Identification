				Just wondering what everyone&#039;s worst experience was with a drug and what drug that they will never do again?<br /><br />For me it was clearly K.. idk if I took too much but that shit had me tripping, seeing a digital picture with everything glowing for like a good 2 hours. It sounds fun but it wasn&#039;t.

				For me it was LSD, I just never sleep when I&#039;m on LSD, it&#039;s really fun but sometimes it last too long ! I had some bad experiences with LSD and that&#039;s why I will not take more LSD now.

				Well the alcohol I have no clear answer but as far as the nicotine I&#039;d suggest switching to an E-cig. I smoked for 10+ years and haven&#039;t had a real cig for almost 8 months now. Got a few ppl to switch so far and they&#039;re quite happy with the change. It still has nicotine in it but minus hundreds of those other chemicals that regular cigs have. Plus they&#039;re actually cheaper too.

				I really started hating mdma.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t mind the taste at first, but now just thinking about it almost makes me puke. As i always dropped those bombs with just water, I even had problems drinking plain water. Always had that taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Magic is long gone and the feeling of happiness feels just so hollow. Its like you couldn&#039;t value something stolen nearly as much as if bought with hard earned money.<br /><br />Plus major depressions the next days.

				I don&#039;t care for amphetamines much. Sure, I like the buzz and energetic feeling, but after a few hours I wish I could turn it off. The day after, I just wish I could get some sleep and think it&#039;s not worth it.

				5WSZR1Zx I agree with you on the alcohol. As much pills and shit I can put up my nose I can&#039;t handle alcohol for shit. 2 drinks and it&#039;s GG. I never really liked it too be honest. Maybe in high school when it was still new to me. <br /><br />About the adderall, I used to do coke back in the day and just recently was using adderall for a bit and a line of adderall blows any line of coke that I have ever done. Could be I was getting shit product or adderall is just better and cleaner. Who knows.<br /><br />

				oo that&#039;s another one that I&#039;ve never tried, I think I&#039;d be too scared too..lol.. I hate trippy stuff, things like K. Anything that messes with your perception but that&#039;s prolly cause I can&#039;t handle it, lol. I think there&#039;s a correlation between someones personality, genetics, and other factors that pull them to certain drugs. Also there life experiences and current life situation factors in. For example it wouldn&#039;t be hard to imagine that a workoholic and what would happen the first time they tried adderall and the aftermath.

				eww benzos...ya just started trying those out and I&#039;ve always been anti-benzo as like what&#039;s the point I take a pill and chill out. For someone like me it&#039;s great at the end of a long night, a little bit too great. I can easily see how you can get hooked on them.<br /><br />Never tried Seroquel but have used Trazadone before and that&#039;s kinda similar a bit I think? That shit is like a KO punch. Sleep 12-14hrs np.<br /><br />Whatever your DOC is remember to stay safe and take occasional breaks.

				Meth because it is so crappy for your body but actually fun and cheap enough to want to take it when nothing else is around.

				I hate crappy drugs and the wrong dose. At the end of the day, we all prefer either stims or psys or opiates ( or a delightful combo&nbsp; :D, but the bad experiences always come from poor quality, cuts and the wrong amount.

It means that you never figured out what it is all about. The mystery is in the body and the way the body works itself into nature.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Even after having that experience you don&#039;t really figure out what it is all about. You definitely figure out something but there&#039;s no way of telling if there&#039;s more to it and how much more. It&#039;s a good question whether humans are able to experience something really unanthropomorphic.
