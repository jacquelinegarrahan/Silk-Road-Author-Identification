				I&#039;ve had 25i plenty of times, but I must say that this product is very very good quality. Clean,zero body load. <br />10:00 I took 1.5 tabs dosed at 1200ug at just before I arrived at a festival. When I got there&nbsp; I sat in a chair with my ipod rocking out for the comeup. <br />10:40 I feel soft and gushy, really mellowed out and things start to look sharper,colors very vivid<br />11:15 I got up and walked around as I felt a wave of euphoria and started laughing <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I look at my hands and everything is crawling , the blood is curling and moving about, then it appears as if&nbsp; some sort of moving ,breathing patterns are coiling up my arms...I&#039;ve seen this before, it&#039;s very beautiful. <br />11:30 - 3am the trip just gets better and better. I feel so loved up,it&#039;s sexual man. I head to the dance floor and shit got wild. The floors were soupy like an ocean,the ceiling and walls were<br />crawling with fractals and other patterns. When I waved my hands it was very traily, leaving colors of lavender,pink and green that would continue to float around in the air. I REALLY love the trails!!! Everything is exploding with color and it&#039;s like you can paint with your hands and then watch the trails left behind morph into whatever your mind wants to envision. <br />The music sounds so emotional and I can hear every voice distinctly. <br />BODY ORGASMS !!! wtf man...as I&#039;m dancing twirling my hands about me I feel an incredible wave of bliss overtake my body,a tingling sensation in my balls as if I&#039;m about to cum...this lasts for hours. Literally orgasm after orgasm , the best feelings in the world! No joke, it was like I had died and went to heaven, all problems ceased as I was washed over in a sea of bliss. Everything was swimmy,like I was in some isolation tank. Just thinking about this blows my mind away...the dimensions of being,of the magnitude of consciousness. <br />Often while dancing I would get &quot;lost&quot; in my head,eyes closed, watching the most beautiful and intricate patterns dance and morph before my closed vision, the most ornate art work ever, blending and churning mosaic like ,and it went with the music well.&nbsp; The next day I felt amazing,in fact I was high<br />as a kite all day,totally blissed out...felt light and euphoric. This afterglow sometimes stays the whole week if you let it.<br />SO all in all: this 25i is outstanding,highly recommended. I love LSD but I am tempted to say that 25i is better as it offers a very deep,visual trip, incredible body highs, and none of the &quot;weirdness&quot; that can happen with acid. My only fear is that this stuff is going to get very popular and the price will skyrocket. Right now, shit, you can have 100 trips for less than $60!!! Think about that!&nbsp; And as far as LSD purists saying 25i is less spiritual, I call<br />bs on that...it&#039;s what YOU make of it...YOU make the trip for the most part. I&#039;ve had very profound insights on 25i when I tripped solo, reflecting on life and being in nature. <br />AMAZING PRODUCT THAT EVERYONE SHOULD EXPERIENCE !<br />THANK YOU THANKYOU THANK YOU SAM !!!
