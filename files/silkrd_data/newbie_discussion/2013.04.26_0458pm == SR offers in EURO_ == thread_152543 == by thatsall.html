				I would love that!<br /><br />And we also need a stable and trustworthy exchange to buy bitcoins using Euros.<br /><br />Bitcoin-24 has been seized by the Police and a lot of people have lost lots of money (me included) :(

				You can use Mtgox to buy Bitcoins using Euros... However, you first need to fund your Mtgox account with euros, usually by bank transfer

				Yes, but MtGox often takes several weeks to process bank transfers in euros (I remember having to wait almost A MONTH!)<br /><br />Bitcoin-24 was wonderful in this aspect, bank transfers took only 1 business day. And the fee was very cheap (less than 1,5 euros per transfer).<br /><br />I registered in bitcoin-central, but now it&#039;s been hacked :(<br /><br />This is horrible. We currently have no serious alternatives to MtGox :(

				I&#039;m not talking about buying stuff on the road with euros. I just suggest to add the option to check the offers not only in btc or $ but also in euros. I am aware of sides like &lt;&lt;&lt;CLEARNET WARNING&gt;&gt;&gt; preev.com e.g. to calculate easily. but it seems good to me, if this option is integrated into SR.<br />

				Mmm, it could be interesting, but it could also introduce some other problems.<br /><br />Which exchange rate (between euros and dollars) should Silk Road display? It varies a lot, and usually banks charge a fee on top of the exchange rate.<br /><br />But, yeah, it could be something like an approximation for informational purposes only. But it should warn the users beforehand.

				Most prices are pegged to USD, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve seen a couple of vendor pages which display all their listings with the USD price instead of BTC price. If I can ever get back on the site and I can find an example I&#039;ll link it back in here.

				as it comes to the exchange rate, there shouldn&#039;t be more problems than with the $. SR refers to the mtgox rate (with some hours delay). as mtgox has an exchange rate for euros, too, it&#039;ll work fine as wells on SR...
