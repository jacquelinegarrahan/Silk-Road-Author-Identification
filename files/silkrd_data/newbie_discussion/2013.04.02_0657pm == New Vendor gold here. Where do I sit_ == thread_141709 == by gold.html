				Your store would be cool for money laundry I&#039;d imagine. You fee is a little high though..

				A few things to consider:<br /><br />Coins and bars will always be higher than spot price since there is purifying, coining, and distribution costs involved. On the flip side, if you resell them you will always get paid above spot price.<br /><br />If you compare my prices to coin dealers, you should see I&#039;m on par. Plus they usually require shipping insurance and restricted delivery which drive your shipping costs to like $50 or more.<br /><br />It may seem high for the smaller coins, but that&#039;s the commission taking a bite at a higher rate for smaller purchases. Plus, smaller coins are always higher per spot price.

				Yes you must be right, I know nothing about coins though.. I was just referring to the dollars you sold, I didn&#039;t know the actual value of your gold but I assumed the fee was the same? But I agree that you can&#039;t sell coins at a price as small as their gold weight.

				Ok, good to know you were talking about the cash. Cause I&#039;m not the only one selling gold on SR, and you&#039;ll see my margins are a LOT lower than anyone else. <br /><br />Yeah, the way I priced the cash was I just undercut everyone. I did this mainly to get some transaction history. If you look, I&#039;m the lowest price for domestic purchase dollars. I&#039;m considering dropping the price of cash even further to close to zero margin. It will still be higher than the exchange rate due to the commission, but if you add multiple to cart, you will see the price/dollar drop significantly since you will be paying a lower commission rate.

				You pay a lower SR commission if you put multiple times the same item to your cart? I didn&#039;t know that. Maybe you should also sell bitcoins since you sell dollars. I don&#039;t wanna launder my money anyways but buying gold is still interesting.

				When I first got on here, I tried adding multiple to the cart and sure enough the price went down per item. But don&#039;t take my word for it, try it for yourself and let me know.<br /><br />Also, I took your advice and realized I&#039;m not trying to make $ selling cash, I&#039;m trying to rack up transaction dollars to get credibility. So in that spirit, I just dropped the cost of dollars even further. I should now be the lowest priced dollars and gold on SR, lower than most by a lot.
