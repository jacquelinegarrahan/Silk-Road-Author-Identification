				I&#039;d like to share a little story. Take from it what you will.<br /><br />I recently had a parcel delivered to my home. I wasn&#039;t there when it arrived, so the carrier left a notice. The next day, I went to the Post Office to pick up the item. The clerk couldn&#039;t find it. While I waited, her boss called the carrier and found out the parcel was out for a second delivery (even though I hadn&#039;t requested it).<br /><br />I went home and a Post Office van was parked outside. The delivery person, who was different from my usual carrier, was sitting in the van. I handed her the delivery notice and she gave me the parcel. Apparently, she had been waiting for me. She said too often parcels get stolen when she leaves them at the door. Obviously she&#039;s also protecting herself (and the Post Office) from fraudulent claims of loss. <br /><br />The upshot? It&#039;s not unusual for the Post Office to insist on delivering a parcel to you personally. I&#039;m always an advocate of caution, but I hope this helps to alleviate some concerns.

				Was it a SR parcel or a regular parcel? If that happened with a shipment of drugs I&#039;d be pretty sketched out

				No, it wasn&#039;t anything illegal. I should have said that upfront.
