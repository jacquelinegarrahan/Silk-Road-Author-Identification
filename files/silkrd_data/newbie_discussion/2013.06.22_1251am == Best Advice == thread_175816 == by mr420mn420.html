				What would you say the best advice to give a newb like myself here on the road. Everyone is seems really cool, its a underground sub-culture where people, for the most part, want to help you.&nbsp; Any tips, tricks(not cheats) or just plain good advice would be great to hear. I am proud to be on the road and I feel lucky to be here to share this amazing exchange of goods and ideas.

				that is actually not bad advice to keep it to yourself...but other than that just stay smart, work with trusted vendors, read reviews, read the forum, keep your Bitcoins clean as possible, use your real name and address when ordering, don&#039;t every sign for any package, use PGP for your address, don&#039;t FE - just use the vendors that don&#039;t require FE for your first few transactions, and if you want something from a vendor that requires that then you will have those under your belt already, start with small purchases under $100 to see how the process works first, ask vendors questions that you have (most of them are happy to answer), use erowid.org for all your drug information, dose yourself careful, recoup after using anything, live prosperously.<br /><br />yes and dont get too sketched out, there are a crap load of people using this system for a good reason, its awesome.

				1) Do your homework - read the wiki, read the forums, etc.<br /><br />2) Use your name and address<br /><br />3) Research the sellers before purchasing<br /><br />4) It is a market so treat it like one, look for the best deal and dont support those sellers that are charging too much because it just allows them to continue to do it.

				Do your research. Ask questions, but don&#039;t expect others do to your homework for you.<br /><br />Learn PGP. Use it.<br /><br />Remember that no matter how casual and easy this seems, drug trafficking is a serious crime, and you will regret it if word gets out in your local community that you&#039;ve been ordering drugs online. If you&#039;re dying to talk to someone about how amazing this place is, talk to other users on the forums: there are plenty of others who&#039;ll share your enthusiasm and who won&#039;t compromise your anonymity. <br /><br />Try a few small orders first just to get comfortable with the process. Ordering one or two gray market items or drugs on the higher end of the schedule makes waiting for the first package less stressful.<br /><br />Be patient. Silk Road isn&#039;t going anywhere and good security (and stealth) can&#039;t be rushed.<br /><br />Important: Everyone here is (potentially) a cop, and anyone can read these posts. Be careful about what you share.<br /><br />Equally important: Give vendors your real name and address. You want to maximize the chances of an unexceptional delivery, and the more normal your packages look, the better. (Also, it&#039;s easier to claim that someone sent drugs in your name than it is to explain what the wrong name is doing on a package apparently meant for you.) If you&#039;re still living with your parents, get a PO box. Ordering drugs to your family&#039;s house is the sort of thing that leads to major police investigations.<br />&nbsp;<br />Resist as much as possible the temptation to use SR while high.<br /><br />Keep calm and carry on.

				If you want to be really safe, check the vendors reviews as the other has said. Look for the best stealth. I rather pay 1 btc more to make sure it is Really good stealth.

				There&#039;s some great tips here.<br /><br />I am curious how often parcels actually get delivered to a residential address (Australia), especially with a lazy postman. I&#039;ve had a SIM card sent to the post office for collection, with a card left at my door, and it would have easily gone into my postbox.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Triple check your address before you send it to the vendor.<br /><br />If you have two vendors offering the same product and they are both shipping domestic but the feedback is a little strange......meaning one guy has 100 with 9 months as a vendor and 400 successful transactions and the other guy is a 99.7 with 9 months on the road and 266 transactions....ALWAYS go with the 100 guy, even if his product costs more.<br /><br />If you are uncertain this little trick works every time (and earned me negative karma in the process!) simply look at the spelling, grammar and punctuation of a big time lister compared to someone that does low volume. Ideally both should be well written (if a native English speaker) with few if any spelling errors. Punct and gramms errors are acceptable in small doses (hey, technical writing ist hard!) but excessive run ons, all caps, muscle-head from Missouri typing has no excuse.<br /><br />DO NOT do work with any vendor that can&#039;t be bothered to spellcheck or grammar check their listing. If they can&#039;t be bothered to spell a few words correctly or to punctuate and format with decor, chances are they can&#039;t be bothered to take the time to do a lot of things right, like their own personal security, erasing your name and address of their computer whence the order is completed and other vital tasks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				My advice is to never finalize early. Seriously, there are dozens of others selling the exact same thing. You may pay a couple dollars more, but is &quot;saving&quot; $12 worth not having it show up at all?
