				Here&#039;s a little list I put together of some vendors that do not require FE for first time or low order count buyers. It is certainly by no means exhaustive. I do not personally vouch for these vendors personally, I merely ran through their profiles for this info. I haven&#039;t even ordered yet! <br /><br />I was shopping for some MDMA somewhere below the $500 price point, so all these vendors had some in-stock at the time of this posting. They of course offer a variety of other goodies as well. <br /><br />If you know of any other vendors that are newbie friendly, please post them! As always, read the vendors instructions and follow them to the letter. <br /><br />In no special order:<br /><br />**Last Updated: September 23, 2013, 09:08 pm**<br /><br />TheHerbalist<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3490c0dd7b<br /><br />technohippy<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/031a27a119<br /><br />Cork1Screw<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/11e4008097<br /><br />galileosophia<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2dbfd15a6b<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206791.0 <br /><br />bodyinaction<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6d74f1e358<br /><br />cubesalesman7600<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12ad522dbf<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92144.0<br /><br />StExo<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9d39982214<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184438.0<br /><br />Jack N Hoff<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cd543c7d28<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171553<br /><br />LaxMax<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/abd97500d8<br /><br />SuperStealthSam<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/dd68c81c09<br />(Bulk shrooms)<br /><br />FartBomber<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/696ed9cdd9<br /><br />NorCalKing<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2877098b49<br /><br />QuickSilverHawk<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d5c0580881<br /><br />Apollonian<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6b3f304da8<br />(Limited quantity for first time orders)<br /><br />BTCB<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/78fbcc6b81/0/25<br />(FE rules vary by item)<br /><br />GearShifter423<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3d54779788<br /><br />RaverLove<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9937e52494<br />(Newbs order &lt; $500)<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168861.0<br /><br />GroovyBruce<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ace172728b<br />(Newbs establish contact first)<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83885.0<br /><br />Tessellated<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/93af9ae133<br /><br />MachineElves <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7076c26b1e<br />(No USA)<br /><br />anon92467686<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/64bd3df17d<br />(Netherlands only)<br /><br />N1NJ4 PR0<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/72190aa4b1<br /><br />GeoffreyGiraffe<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f7441e60e1<br /><br />vividvisions<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b0184f0ffd<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154522.msg1077783;topicseen#msg1077783<br /><br />9asay<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/031357083f<br /><br />usa2usadutchxtc<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c7006419f1<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=81344.0<br /><br />hypnotiqstatez77<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7c7bfcb881<br /><br />garthvader911<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6ff896c799<br /><br />funbags101<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/96e65a0f4b<br /><br />ashylarry<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f85784d8b0<br />Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140269.0<br /><br />kwiktrip<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/604415c683<br /><br />Koenigsegg<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/34fd3aca38<br /><br />Einstein777<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9448462206<br /><br />BestPricePills<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c5195bb669<br /><br />Thanks and good luck!<br /><br /><br />

				I really like that idea, but even though i have 1,000$+ in purchases, I have never had a problem buying from vendors as a newbie, I always thought to myself to never finalize early and i&#039;ve never been ripped off on here, i had an incident which turned out to be a vendor preparing the parcel for me and he forgot to ship it, a few messages with him and he realized he messed up and shipped it right away.<br /><br />IMO the best advice for newbies is:<br /><br />1. dont buy from vendors that require FE, even if the product looks great<br /><br />2. check a vendors reviews on their page before ordering from them<br /><br />3. be an honest person, dont try to scam vendors, they work hard for their....digital currency<br />and if youre an honest person you&#039;ll get a good reputation

				Your step #1 is the reason I made this thread! <br /><br />Though I&#039;m sure buying and FEing from a well renown vendor would more than likely end well, they often don&#039;t even give us newbs a chance :(

				You can add MACHINE ELVES to your list if you are after &quot;Shit Hot&quot; DMT&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />They were fantastic and never ask for FE (although they do limit the amount you can buy if below a certain number of purchases and / or too many refunds, etc)<br /><br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7076c26b1e

				@Mister Mortimer <br /><br />Bungee54&#039;s profile clearly states he requires FE:<br />&quot;IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 10 SILK ROAD TRANSACTIONS WORTH 1000€ IN AGGREGATE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FE BUT REFUND POLICY APPLIES!<br />IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 5 SILK ROAD TRANSACTIONS YOU CAN ONLY ORDER WITH FE &amp; NO OPTION ON REFUND !&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve updated the list with your suggestions. Keep em coming! Please feel free to update with any more vendors and I&#039;ll do my best to keep this updated. <br /><br />Do you guys n gals think this would be worth it to make this a sticky post? I don&#039;t care if someone else takes this info; I crave karma no more. I just want to make it easier for us newbs to dive in and get to ordering! <br />

				US Vendors<br />Best Price Pills<br />Einstien777<br /><br />Both great to deal with<br /><br />Honestly I do not know why anyone would FE especially if you have never bought from a particular vendor before, they knew the rules when they signed up, This way the risk is split, seems fair to me.<br />

				Groovy, that I can understand.&nbsp; In my few experiences here I have never, not once even needed to contact the vendor, placed my order, arrives in mail a few day later.&nbsp; I mean these guys aren&#039;t your doctor, or psychiatrist, they are there to make money at a big risk, I find it amazing some respond at all to misc. questions.&nbsp; I guess the real test would be when something doesn&#039;t arrive or is wrong, that would separate the good from bad I suppose.

				I need to add myself to that list. <br /><br />I am open to legitimate transactions with newbies and have no qualms about working within the escrow system for new buyers.<br /><br />Please, if you&#039;re in the market for some excellent CA-grown buds, come shop with me.&nbsp; You won&#039;t be disappointed.&nbsp; I offer great customer service, packaging, and product.&nbsp; Treat yourself and don&#039;t fuck with FE.<br /><br />See my seller page in my message signature.<br /><br />Look forward to working with you!
