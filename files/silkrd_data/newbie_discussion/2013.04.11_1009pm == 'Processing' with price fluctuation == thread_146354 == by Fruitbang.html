				Hello there. I hope the following question isn&#039;t too wasteful of your time.<br /><br />So I recently made one of my first deposits and orders, and picked a real doozy of a time to do so in the process it seems, what with the mania and Mtgox issues. Ah well :). <br /><br />My situation is this:&nbsp; my order was made before the crash, and is now &#039;processing&#039;. The vendor, however, has now logically adjusted his prices according to the changed value of the bitcoin, and the same item has now risen slightly in price. <br /><br />Am I wasting my time waiting for this to go through? Or is this stage of the exchange a done deal and it&#039;s just my good fortune I got it slightly cheaper? <br /><br />Furthermore, would it be considered &#039;bad form&#039; for the vendor to cancel, or merely savvy?<br /><br />I understand there&#039;s some sort of &#039;hedging&#039; system but as to which stage of the transaction this applies to I&#039;m not sure. I thought I&#039;d turn here in my ignorance anyway. <br /><br />Thanks for any replies!

				Hey.<br /><br />You can see whether the transaction was hedged or not in your orders. if you click on the item, theres a line that states : total price.<br />when that is $, youre safe, when its in btc its like this :<br />from what ive heard, its pretty much up to the vendor to accept those orders.<br />sooo... either its gonna be cheap drugs or youll lose some money.
