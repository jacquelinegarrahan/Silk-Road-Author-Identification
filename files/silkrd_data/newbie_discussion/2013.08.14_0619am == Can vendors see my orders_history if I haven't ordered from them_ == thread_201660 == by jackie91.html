				I am getting messages from vendors I haven&#039;t done any business with offering me deals for products I routinely buy. How do they know what I am buying? I don&#039;t reveal what I routinely buy in the forums, I don&#039;t share my buying history with anyone, except for vendors I do business with and even then they should only be able to see my stats, right? What am I not aware of?<br /><br />enlightenment greatly appreciated.

				No, at least, not that I am aware of. I only see dollar and percentage statistics.<br /><br />This is alarming, you may want to notify the staff. Or at least, I&#039;d be concerned.

				I will contact SR Support. I did some searching after my post and I saw there are vendors offering for sale to other vendors some method of seeing a buyers stats even if they haven&#039;t been contacted by the buyer. They don&#039;t say anything about order history, just stats. I&#039;ll keep looking.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;No, no-one can see your history but you and admin. Can you post some (edited) examples of these messages mate?

				I deleted the other one but it was from a vendor who exclusively sells a product that I order very often. Of my 46 purchases 34 of them are for the product the vendor sells , and that is the only product he sells. I looked at his listings and profile but didn&#039;t order from him because I didn&#039;t like what I saw.<br /><br />Got this one after buying BTC with reload card. And I got it long before the vendor filled up the forum with their lame ad.<br /><br /><br />[▌฿ ▌HOT　Ｐｒｏｍｏｔｉｏｎ　10 BITCOIN＝＄８０９ send in 1-10minutes{24hou<br />« Sent to: whenwhy, darxter, TeamGB, Shaggy Shaman, jackie91<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply to All<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Delete<br /><br />[▌฿ ▌HOT　Ｐｒｏｍｏｔｉｏｎ　10 BITCOIN＝＄８０９ send in 1-10minutes{24hours Livehelp satisfy service}<br />1 BITCOIN＝$99<br />2 BITCOIN＝＄１９４<br />3 BITCOIN＝＄２８６<br />4 BITCOIN＝＄３６９ www.bitinme.com 　[protect by trustwave and mcafee]<br />5 BITCOIN＝４４９<br />6 BITCOIN＝＄５２９<br />7 BITCOIN＝＄６０２<br />8 BITCOIN＝６７７ www.bitinme.com&nbsp; [secure payment and positive SSL]<br />9 BITCOIN＝＄７３９<br />15 BITCOIN＝＄１１９９<br />20 BITCOIN＝＄１５９９ www.bitinme.com&nbsp; [okpay PAYPAL AND CREDITCARD 3D PROTECT]<br />30 BITCOIN＝＄２１９９<br />(Special)40 BITCOIN FREE EXTRA 1 BITCOIN BONUS＝＄２７９９<br />(Special)50 BITCOIN FREE EXTRA 2 BITCOIN BONUS＝＄３０９９<br />http://www.bitinme.com<br />www.bitinme.com

				I think it is merely coincidence.&nbsp; I routinely get messages claiming to be selling cheap cocaine/btc.&nbsp; If you set your forum account to not show others when you are online you will probably stop getting these messages.

				This happens to me all the time to the point i was going to start a thread and ask are any other constantly bothered by these. It&#039;s usually from completely new account without much or any posts. And i can see these messages/spams are sent to others as well. I often get same two times as well. Am i unlucky or are others getting these as much as i do...
