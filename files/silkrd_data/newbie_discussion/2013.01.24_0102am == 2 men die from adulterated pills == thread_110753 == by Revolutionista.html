				In my local city 2 guys died a few days ago from taking adulterated ecstasy tablets (pma apparently). As expected the typically think inside the box media spent all the airtime reminding people how dangerous taking drugs are and predictably did their bit to try and scare people away instead of pointing out if theyd been supplied with good product none of this would have happened. <br />This was more of a rant combined with trying to get to 50 without taking the piss but the idea the government doesnt make any effort to save the lives of drug users never mind the logic of not decriminalising just really twists my melon.

				Just another reason why adulterated shit= bad shit.&nbsp; The consequences are more unpredictable than using what you &quot;expect&quot; to be using and if it turns into a scenario where you end up in the ER usually the dr&#039;s are just going to treat you for what they CAN find in your system.&nbsp; So yea..fuck that<br />TinyDot

				Not being a chemist I dont know wether pma is a deliberate addition or wether its a byproduct of making mdma when you dont know what your doing. Id prefer the 1st. Dont like to think that even my favourite vendors on sr might inadvertently send out pma in their pills. Plus the contaminant being pma is being investigated as we speak by authorities but im guessing somone has already tested it using a home kit because it &#039;seems&#039; to be common knowledge

				Most of the &#039;danger&#039; of drugs like MDMA comes from their legal status, which means dodgy suppliers, unknown dosages, and damaging adulterants. Exactly how an argument for keeping alcohol banned during prohibition was the &#039;dangers&#039; of methanol-adulterated supplies turning you blind, as if that&#039;s somehow proof of the danger of alcohol itself. Some day, I hope that all drugs will be legalised - not just decriminalized... unless they can be manufactured and sold legally on an industrial scale, the dangers of contamination are still there. It really does sadden me that politicians these days, that obviously experimented with cannabis in their youth, and know full well how harmless some drugs are (and are smart people, so must at an intellectual level be able to appreciate the benefits in harm-reduction that would come from legalisation), still support the obviously broken status-quo. In thrall to the tabloid newspapers, afraid of losing votes, outright admitting that they follow (misinformed) popular opinion rather than evidence-based science... sigh. No wonder David Nutt resigned.

				So does anyone know about the synthesis of mdma? Is the pma an unexpected reaction/lack of reaction on the way to making mdma or has someone specifically set out to make the stuff? Not gona lie ive had thoughts of doing one huge cook with the help of a paid degree educated chemist to set me for life but if im relying on&nbsp; someone else knowing what their doing and I dont know what im doing maybe thats a bit reckless? I suppose you can always use several of the freely available testing kits after its made but id still like to know if the supplier is incompetent or if he had an agenda

Its funny how &#039;misuse of drugs&#039; use goes hand in hand with political dissatisfaction.<br />As for the recipes iv seen them before and im pretty sure you can buy a guide on sr for very cheap but even with a significant understanding of basic chemistry it wasnt something I could do myself. The plan is to psych some broke ass university leaver into a one off &#039;job&#039; after I spend a couple of years safely accumulating the necessary chemicals in the correct ratios. <br />

				To put it simply, PMA adulterated pills don&#039;t hit the market accidently. Somewhere in the chain, an asshole threw it in the mix for monetary gains/higher profit margins, or self-fulfilling sociopathic reasons. Thank this community for its bountiful supply of quality substances, and honest reviews from users. If you ask me, if SR ever shut down, those responsible for it&#039;s downfall deserve death. There would be a tragic surge in people looking for street drugs and getting garbage from unethical, poor, lazy-ass motherfuckers.

In my teens I got to know a girl who didn&#039;t like me taking E, because she knew two guys who died because their pills were spiked with rat poison (!) She seemed serious but it makes no sense. Surely the second rule of dealing drugs (after &quot;don&#039;t get caught&quot;) is &quot;make sure your customers come back&quot;. If you kill your customers, they don&#039;t buy more. The guy pressing them couldn&#039;t have been so goddamn stupid to cut them with rat poison, surely? You don&#039;t need to be a chemist to know that crap is bad for humans.
