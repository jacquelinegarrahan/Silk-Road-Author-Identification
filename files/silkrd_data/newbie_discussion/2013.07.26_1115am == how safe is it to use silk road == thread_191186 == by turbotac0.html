				NOT SAFE AT ALL! YOU MAKE ANY TRANSACTION YOU ARE GOING TO PRISON FOR 5 YEARS! DON&#039;T DO IT!!!<br /><br />Kidding obviously. It&#039;s safe so long as you do your homework, choose a good vendor and know what to do in an instance shit goes south with LEO.

But at the same time always stay smart and stay safe. Never give out any details about yourself or where you are from and NEVER put your address into a text box and hit enter. Like I said before learning pgp is key. And remember, there are no stupid questions!!!!

				i love SR been on it for awhile now and never had an issue with anything, i dont ever feel paranoid more like excitement to see what comes, do as these other replies have told you.....many use SR everyday without a hitch....once you get you first couple transaction under your belt you will feel safer trust me......this is a way better method than going to a street corner somewhere atleast i think it is.

I just treat every order like I&#039;m a newb. I run with the assumption that no matter how many precautions you take, there&#039;s still a possibility of every transaction going south and making sure that I have an out. Hell, I don&#039;t even run a persistent volume on tails in the instance that something goes south and there&#039;s a search that I have plausible deniability. I just hope that people stay as safe as possible for their own safety as well as mine. Recently there have been a ton of newbs who have been fucking up shit left and right when they are ordering by using fake names, doing dumb shit, etc. That raises the possibility of a vendor getting caught up which could increase the odds of finding myself in a pinch. Just be careful is all I am saying.&nbsp; Don&#039;t start getting so excited about SR ordering that you get comfortable and make a small mistake, cut corners, etc. Especially newbs. That puts us all at risk.

I been a long time pot smoker, even in the old days when I would pay 70 bucks for a quarter of high grade circa 1990 Oregon weed, and only get 40 dollars worth, or get taken. Most of the time, I got ripped off. Eventually I began to hate dealing with dishonest motherfuckers and started drinking, eventually by 2008 I was a drunk, and got charged with a felony because I couldn&#039;t stop drinking and did crazy shit while drunk. All because I loved pot so much that I was forced to hate it. And I hated it because supply was a fucking issue. As as far as what I have learned so far about SR, supply isn&#039;t an issue. Just protecting our vendors and ourselves. That part is easy.<br /><br />In my mind these days my use isn&#039;t a concern to the pigs, I am not planning on dealing it though the thought does entertain me. Still boggles my mind that I can get a qp for 800. I spent that much for two oz on the street last year, even with all the dispensary weed making its way from Wash. and Colo. last year and it was mixed strains/quality.<br />I look forward to getting my supply from the vendors here. Keep that purple kush/varieties coming, they are my favorites, and the hash....Heavan.<br /><br />Much love and dope.<br /><br />V.
