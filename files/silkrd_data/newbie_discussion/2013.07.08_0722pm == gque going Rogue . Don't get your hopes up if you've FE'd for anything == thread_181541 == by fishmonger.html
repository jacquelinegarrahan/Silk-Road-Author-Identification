				Seems all too common with FE&#039;s and that&#039;s why people advocate against them, but in any case sorry to hear. At least you learned something and have grown, which is what I&#039;m told we&#039;re all here to do in the first place :)

				This guy decided to rip everyone off with f.e, I was checking out his new listing on china white<br />and was thinking of ordering a sample. I&#039;m glad I take my time with my purchases.<br />You can usually tell there&#039;s something wrong , cartel de norte and gque were both new vendors 3 months<br />cartel had good looking products and lots of them but i heard that he was an old ripoff vendor with a new name.<br />gque seem to have decent feedback on his coke listing till just a couple days ago.<br />order small with a new vendor and stay in escrow. i only f.e for long time vendors and i know im still taking a risk<br />doing that, just make sure when you finalize that you know you could be throwing your money away.

				I&#039;m pretty sure gque has done the runner. I&#039;m pissed off as had $600 tied up with him/her. I&#039;m in Australia (so hence the FE). Never had a problem with any vendors on here previously, but think I might have met my match. Hopefully time will tell. Surely they will stop vendors gaining high ratings by giving out samples. Lesson learnt, stick to trusted sellers!
