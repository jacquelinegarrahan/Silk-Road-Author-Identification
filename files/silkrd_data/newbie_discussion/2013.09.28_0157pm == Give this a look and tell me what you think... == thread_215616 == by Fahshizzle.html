				Is it possible to use Tails as a cold storage for my wallets? i understand there&#039;s a VERY small chance i have&nbsp; keylogger or trojan deep in my BIOS that would boot along with Tails but just assume i dont for this :D<br /><br />What i&#039;d like to do is this:<br />Save a wallet generator to something like an SD card<br />Disconnect the ethernet (no wireless installed)<br />Boot Tails (w/Persistence)<br />Generate 50 cold storage wallets<br />Import the public keys into a spreadsheet doc<br />Import the private keys into a DIFFERENT spreadsheet doc<br />Save the public keys to my persistence volume<br />Save the private keys AND the generator to the SD card (should probably have a b/u of this in case the card craps out then all my private keys would be lost!)<br />Reboot and all of that should be gone allowing me to carry on as normal<br /><br />I think this provides a &quot;clean and safe&quot; (enough for a small timer like myself anyway) way to generate and maintain my account. The reason for so many wallets is because i will be disposing of them after every use. My buddy and i will be tumbling our funds, in fact since im at it, look this over and tell me what you think, please and thanks! :D <br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works (looking for ways to improve or if there&#039;s pointless redundancy):<br /><br />We go in half on the btc purchase - 10btc/2 = 5 per person = Wallet A &amp; Wallet B, diff localbitcoin transaction, could do 80/20 70/30 doesnt matter but for ease of understanding, whole numbers make life easier<br />Send the seperate BTC we each bought to the other person - Wallet A&#039;s 5BTC goes to Wallet B, and vice versa. It&#039;ll shows funds were paid to someone but LE would never know who<br />We BOTH then send the 5 &quot;NEW&quot; BTC to the same wallet - &quot;Wallet C&quot; is now a &quot;spending wallet&quot; and will never be used again, the coins have also been tumbled at this point to an anonymous person<br />Prepare and shop, acquire total - Lets say the total comes out to 8BTC, again for ease of math as it will probably never come out that perfect<br />Send all 10BTC to SR from Wallet C and spend<br />The remaining 2 BTC are then sent out to Wallet D and Wallet E evenly<br />Wallets D &amp; E could be flagged as coming out of the SR! - To combat this, we send the coin to a common cold storage wallet, &quot;Wallet F&quot; before spending but AFTER/IF D &amp; E need additional funds<br />Wallet F will become the same spending wallet as C was in the above example for the next purchase. <br /><br />When you draw it out on paper it has a cool &quot;helix&quot; pattern and it really makes sense BUT im far from experienced so some help refining would be great :D

				I fear you dont understand the term tumble you might want to read up on it a bit more because that can be traced to point of sale

				@cryngie<br /><br />Oh but i do. I&#039;m referring to spending the coins completely unrelated to the SR. At this point im nowhere near big enough to worry about an actual mixing service. call the &quot;flipping&quot; of the coins w/e you want but really it&#039;s the same thing. <br /><br />you still have to send your coin to a mixing service leaving that trace. the same trace as me sending to my buddy except LE knows about the mixing services and they dont know about my generated wallet<br /><br />if im still not understanding YOUR point, please enlighten me. im here to learn and your post wasn&#039;t constructive at all

				Ok every transaction is tracable through the blockchain what a mixer/tumbler does is breaks up the coins into random amounts and multiple transactions thus making it virtually impossible to trace where as yours I could trace through blockchain to the point of purchase easily

				well fuck, i put a lot of work into that flow chart... was hoping using a friend to buy the coin for me and then sending it on to me would solve the traceability of it

				epic fail on that one, but if you get a wallet from say blockchain.info they tumble them for you there is also a deepweb service called bitfog but they have a higher charge 1-3% from memory and blockchain is instant

				im trying to set up a local Lucy gig since there aint shit here, nothing huge and all blot&#039;s. what do you suggest i do? Blot is super easy to conceal and no matter how safely i buy btc i still have to ship it. ive accepted that but as for buying btc, there are 10 million pages of different ways to do it and a lot of them have conflicting information. in a way i said fuck it and am now willing to even walk into a bank and make a deposit using localbitcoin. really it&#039;s &quot;pretty safe&quot; as long as im not ordering a libraries worth. say 1 sheet at a time. <br /><br />what would you suggest? <br /><br />bitinstant sounds cool but the month wait to get to level 2 is lame, im trying to get a 5 strip anyday now
