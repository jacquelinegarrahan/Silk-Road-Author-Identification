				Just going to post this to the newbie section because I don&#039;t have to patience to spam 50 posts right now.<br /><br />Flashback a couple of weeks to the USPS rate change.&nbsp; I had ordered something right around this time and the package never got to me.<br />Long story short the vendor used too little postage, realized that mine and some of his other packages weren&#039;t arriving because of this and graciously gave me a full refund.<br />I had since ordered from a different vendor and had no trouble.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since successfully order from the vendor who&#039;s package didn&#039;t arrive plus two others.<br /><br />Yesterday I get a signature card in the mailbox telling me to come to the post office and sign for a package or sign the card and leave it for the mailman.<br />Card list sender as US Postal Inspector.&nbsp; I have no outstanding SR orders and am not expecting any other packages.&nbsp; This is obviously my order which never arrived due to the rate change.&nbsp; As much as I would like this package it goes without saying I shan&#039;t be going to pick it up or sign for anything.<br /><br />The only question I have is this:&nbsp; will I be able to safely receive at this address anymore.&nbsp; This package came to their attention because of incorrect postage and an obviously incorrect return address.&nbsp; Would that have caused them to inspect/open the package?&nbsp; If they just wanted the difference in postage they would not be asking for a signature.&nbsp; Also the card would say that there is postage due, which this one did not.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really panicking or anything cause I won&#039;t be signing for the package but I am apprehensive about shipping here in the future.&nbsp; Any constructive thoughts or relating of similar experiences would be appreciated.

				The package is lost.&nbsp; It cannot be recovered, it contains nothing of interest and you need to remember that for your own safety.&nbsp; It sounds like the guy is fishing.&nbsp; They&#039;re spread pretty thin.&nbsp; Sign that and you&#039;re obviously worth a little more time.&nbsp; Throw it away because you have no clue what it&#039;s talking about, and you&#039;ll never hear from anyone again probably.&nbsp; Unfortunately... I doubt they&#039;ll just wipe it away from history that easily.&nbsp; So you best assume they&#039;ll be watching more closely.<br /><br />C&#039;mon.&nbsp; It&#039;s junk mail.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you agree...?&nbsp; ;)

				Short answer: No. There is no way I&#039;d continue to use that address.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the situation: The postal service now has possession of a package with your address on it, with suspicious/illegal contents in it. It doesn&#039;t take much thought to realize that with a fake return address and a real delivery address, and illegal contents, you tried and failed at getting something illegally from someone not in your area. <br /><br />If you do decide not to pick up the package, do be aware that the postal service does open packages that are left unclaimed - and you can bet they&#039;ll be contacting you after they find what&#039;s in it, looking for answers. I don&#039;t mean to scare you, but I am directly related to a postal service employee and this is exactly what they have told me about a package I lost in the process a couple years back. (It contained books, not illegal goods though.)<br /><br />It MAY be better to sign for the package, act like you had no idea it was coming to you or what was in it, and basically do as you would if you really did have no idea a package was coming your way. They cannot prove you ordered it, if you&#039;ve done things correctly.<br /><br />This is just my thoughts on the matter. I have only second-hand knowledge of USPS workings with packages that don&#039;t make it to their recipients.

				Never ever ever ever ever ever sign for a package with illegal contents.&nbsp; It&#039;s the surest way to get busted because you are implicitly acknowledging that it is your package.&nbsp; &nbsp;No good can come from signing for it.&nbsp; And no, I would not use that address for illegal shipments in the future.&nbsp; Better not to get shipments in your name again either, but if you insist on taking that risk, get a private PO Box one town away from yours.&nbsp;

				Definitely won&#039;t be signing anything.&nbsp; The notice is torn up and discarded already as will be any potential future ones.&nbsp; Just wondering what happens next.

				Have a story ready - always be prepared to be visited or questioned. Be paranoid for a while, just to be safe. After a month, you can safely consider yourself good. But do have that new address ready.
