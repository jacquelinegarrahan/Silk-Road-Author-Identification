				Hello SRoaders,<br />Its been a while since I&#039;ve posted, so here if a little insight...<br />Step one, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. No matter what angle LE comes at you, just refrain from saying anything until you can speak with an attorney.<br />Step two; get a court appointed attorney. Do not go out and get the &quot;big dog&quot; drug attorney to represent you, yet.<br />Depending on your circumstance/evidence and charges brought upon you, let the court appointed attorney do all the leg work for you. The DA will sometimes give them a plea deal and now you have a starting point to go to the &quot;big dog&quot; and say can you do better? This will save you thousands of dollars in b.s. charges that the &quot;big dogs&quot; will milk out of you.<br /><br />&quot;Lawyers are the root of all evil&quot;<br /><br />My 2 cents,<br />GP

				Great advise,<br /><br />does that mean you can tell the court appointed attorney all the truth and they have to keep it between him/her and you?<br /><br />That sounds pretty cool client confidentiality.

No matter what angle LE comes at you, just refrain from saying anything until you can speak with an attorney.<br />Probably the best thing you can do!<br /><br />Step two; get a court appointed attorney. Do not go out and get the &quot;big dog&quot; drug attorney to represent you, yet.<br />Depending on your circumstance/evidence and charges brought upon you, let the court appointed attorney do all the leg work for you. The DA will sometimes give them a plea deal and now you have a starting point to go to the &quot;big dog&quot; and say can you do better? This will save you thousands of dollars in b.s. charges that the &quot;big dogs&quot; will milk out of you.<br /><br />Now i cant speak from experience but have had several friends get busted in different circumstances. 1) my Hispanic roommate who was completely harassed throughout the whole ordeal. Had 2 bags of diff strands (bad idea if your traveling) all with half eighths in them and received attempt to distribute charge (seems ridiculous to me but i see there point but they honestly were for personal use. He then stupidly got caught a few days later. Ordered the &quot;big dog&quot; and managed to have all charges dropped if he did PTI (first time offender) didnt quit any drugs passed all drug tests and now hes good to go. but he paid upwards of 6000g s to get it dropped.<br /><br /><br />scenario number 2 was a big bust on my former roommate (who i knew was inevitably going to get busted so i moved out. Next house he moved into he got caught with&nbsp; ounces of shrooms molly, pills (roxys,bars,sheets of acid...the works) so they were fucked oh yea and each tenant had a QP of bud or less in each of their bedrooms. I think it depends on how much money you have and what your charges are but if my future depending on getting this shit dropped to take classes and drug tests through a preventative program id do it id pay whatever it takes. I see where your coming from but money really can buy your freedom! which is fucked up for us poorer folks but i fully understand it is all about cirumstances and what your charged with<br /><br />hope it helped idk im kinda barred out&nbsp; :) from my first order that arrived moments ago haha&nbsp; 8)

				Don&#039;t let them break you when you are in lock up. Always wait for a lawyer.

				You never get broken when you first go in unless there&#039;s no chance for bail. I was in jail for quite some time before I was finally released on bail, and now I&#039;m ditching the country.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t so much about saving money as it is about &quot;how to properly do your time&quot;. It&#039;s pretty obvious to go to the big dogs asking if they can do better. I dunno. Maybe I just planned better than most people, I guess.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t get caught, guys. Don&#039;t even tell your fucking brother.

				Got an order in the mail a few days ago and a cop came by my house yesterday for a completely unrelated reason. LE definitely caught me off guard! <br /><br />Might be wise to rehearse what you might say, won&#039;t cost you more than five mins and will save you in the bigger picture.

				I think it goes without saying to try to not get caught. But my analogy is like being a professional motor cross rider and not crashing and getting hurt. Its not if, its when. I haven&#039;t met a drug dealer yet that hasn&#039;t been busted. I consider myself&nbsp; lucky so far.
