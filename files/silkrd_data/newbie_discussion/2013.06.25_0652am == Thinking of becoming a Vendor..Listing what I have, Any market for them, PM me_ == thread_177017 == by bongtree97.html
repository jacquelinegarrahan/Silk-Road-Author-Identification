				Well I see a psychiatrist and I get RX certain meds I dont want along with the meds I do want...That being said I have meds that I dont want and Instead of keep them or just toss them I was thinking of selling them... here is what I have...Just curious if there is a big market for this stuff..<br /><br />Phentermine 37mg&nbsp; 50+/- of them<br />Trazadone-100mg&nbsp; &nbsp; 200+ of them<br />Cymbalta-60mg (i think thats the mg?) 30 of them<br />Adderall-IR 20mg 175+/- of them<br />&nbsp;Norcos 10/325 (yellow ones)<br />Lexapro 100 +/- of them<br /><br />If I were to sell what would you as a buyer pay and is there a demand for such? <br /><br />&nbsp;Im not a &quot;big time&quot; wanting to be seller, It would be just a &quot;my extra meds every month&quot; type deal...<br /><br />Currently Im into more of the lsd, mdma, weed and benzo type thing so these meds listed dont really suit me..Also I dont like taking RX meds other than alprazolam or kolopin...<br /><br />I hope Im not breaking any rules by posting this but if anyone is interested in buying some or trying one let me know I can send pics or whatever need to show legit-ness (?) lol, heck Ill even send a sample if you pay for shipping, Ive bought enough to know how to stealth ship so don&#039;t fret :p<br /><br />&nbsp;...Im a buyer not a seller but I paid for these meds I have about a 3-4 month supply of all of them and they are just sitting there : /&nbsp; <br /><br />

				SR is a little like Ebay in terms of doing market research.<br /><br />Have a product you might like to sell? Find other vendors who are selling it and see if there is any purchase history. Check prices across vendors over regions. Adjust accordingly. ????. Profit. Rinse. Repeat.<br /><br />I know for a fact that the last three script items you listed I would be able to sell on the street in minutes. Here on SR, they are guaranteed to sell.<br /><br />It would be a very good way of supplying yourself with all the psychedelics and weed you could want. :)<br /><br />Good luck on your endevour.

You may give out free items to others if you wish (though we advise people not to give their details to anonymous strangers on the forums for obvious reasons) but if you attempt to make sales again before obtaining vending privileges your account will be deleted.<br /><br />Libertas

				As I say above there needs to be a clear and fully accessible link on the home page to become a vendor unless you do not want any more of them,&nbsp; Otherwise, you offer no alternative to workarounds such as negotiating off-board transactions here or someplace else.&nbsp; PLEASE FIX THE BUG.
