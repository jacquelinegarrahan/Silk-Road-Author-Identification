				Definitely more appropriately priced (reflective of street value - not these exaggerated prices; can you believe some douche bags on here charge $800 a gram?!), and better quality heroin. The gear, when available, on here is nearly 200% overpriced, and worse quality than I&#039;ve ever scored on the street.<br /><br />And more Oxycodone, preferably Oxycodone - not Oxycontin. The ER/CR is too much waste. Get some Oxynorm in tens and twenties mg and if you can match, or even come reasonably close to, international prices ($0.65-$1/gram depending on amount purchased) you&#039;ll get some very worthwhile business. There is a huge market, and no reasonable or consistent supply.

				It&#039;s very very rare to find decently priced domestic Oxy&#039;s. Or opiates in general I guess.<br />But yeah, profit margin might be a bit less than the other drugs but I&#039;m sure the demand would be high at the right price.

I mean I&#039;ve known of singles of Endone (5mg) being sold for $20 a pill, but also as low as $5 a pill - even for purchases of only 1-5 units. Bulk(ish) sales, by that I mean anything from a pack (20 pills) to 3-4 packs, then $0.80-1/gram ($80-100 a box; generally the cheaper price is for multiple packs) is standard practice in my experience IRL. I&#039;ve never known of IRL sales above 4 boxes in one transaction so I can&#039;t speak for prices beyond those amounts, but I&#039;d hazard a guess that you&#039;d never get much lower than $0.60-70/gram even with 500 unit amounts. And this is just for Endone - Oxycontin 80s are a whole different ball game, I used to know of them going as cheap as $20/pill even with purchases as small as 20 pills. But usually $40-60 a pill was the standard, even for singles.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=145733.msg1044003#msg1044003">Quote from: aussiepp on April 23, 2013, 03:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IMO, anywhere near $1 per MG is a pretty decent price. <br />I&#039;ve only came across one person selling them IRL and he was charging $25 for 5mg.

If you&#039;re buying singles or even &lt;20 pills on here you&#039;re wasting both the vendor&#039;s and your own time. Once you&#039;re talking about 200+ mg than I think we should be heading toward $0.80/mg prices<br /><br />The douche you came across IRL was a goose. Though I guess it&#039;s entirely dependent on location and supply too. Anyone paying $5/mg, even for a single, is an idiot. Though like I said before I have known of a single Endone (5mg) going for $20 but this was to a desperate junkie who needed anything to kill his heroin fix.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=145733.msg1044041#msg1044041">Quote from: Tellemetree on April 23, 2013, 04:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">RL 80s at $45 - $70, 40s at $30 - $45.

And when you know they&#039;re either importing from international SR vendors at &lt;$1/gram prices, or obtaining them direct from pharm labs here for even less, it makes you sick.

If you&#039;re buying singles or even &lt;20 pills on here you&#039;re wasting both the vendor&#039;s and your own time. Once you&#039;re talking about 200+ mg than I think we should be heading toward $0.80/mg prices<br /><br />The douche you came across IRL was a goose. Though I guess it&#039;s entirely dependent on location and supply too. Anyone paying $5/mg, even for a single, is an idiot.

				We all have our own preferences ofcourse. <br />Myself the best drug in existence for recreational use, is MDMA. Pills are fine when strong and clean. Ive yet to ever try molly amazingly enough. I had some MDA a few weeks back but it was an MDMA experience without the overwhelming euphoria which is what I personally love about MDMA. A good combination was MDMA caps with added 2CB which really was amazing. Not sure what ratio but it worked like a dream. <br />If you can get hold of some clean pure MDMA crystal or some of the amazing pill imports floating around europe Ill be buying from you. When the word is out that the pills are good, I mean good like back in the day good, they will sell. Green Mitsubishi, the original dark speckled ones had me flat on my arse sweating, eyes wobbling and then had me up dancing at some gay club in Canberra, mind you Im not gay and I have social anxiety so figure. Best drug on earth, just cant do it every day.<br />I really liked the MDMA 2CB caps. If I could source them Id get them again. The vendor I got them from has gone stealth for about 3 months now. He may have been the one busted in Perth I think. Busted becuse he was selling from home not from SR.

				I&#039;m still waiting for the one bright domestic vendor who realizes that yes, they can get a half ounce of coke for &lt;1000 if they look around, 100g of mdma for $1500 or less and the list goes on. <br /><br />Supply and demand I know. If you were smart about it you would stack your cash, wait and buy a sizeable amount of good quality shit then charge acceptable prices like $200 flat rate for MDMA. $250-300 for a gram of coke. Not 400+. Yes people will still buy it at 400+ a gram but if you had your molly listed at 200 (which would still net you 20k in sales from a &lt;2k investment) you would get an overflow of business. It would literally fly out the door at reasonable prices. Any drug would. So much greed. Then the vendors cry &quot;we&#039;re taking the risk. We name the price.&quot; Fair enough. Your gear your price... If your price was 20-30% cheaper your business would improve tenfold. <br /><br />I know many(myself included) continue to get from overseas and honestly do nothing but laugh at domestic vendors. Again if a vendor offered me a street price, I&#039;d be tempted to take it.<br /><br />Why would I bother fucking around getting bitcoins and waiting for mail to purchase something I could chase around and get on the street for cheaper? Sure the quality won&#039;t be as good depending on what it is but I sure as fuck am not paying $100 for a point of meth when you can nearly get a gram for that on the road and half that price on the street.<br /><br />TL;DR: Have reasonable prices. They will come in the masses.<br />/rant.

				reasonably priced heroin. there is only 3 domestic H vendors on SR and 1 only joined 2 days ago. All are way overpriced even if you dont look @ OS prices. I have purchased off 1 of the au vendors and even tho the service couldnt be faulted it wasnt great. The quality wasnt there either. ATM im buying from OS and even tho it takes a week to arrive the quality is double and the price is 25% or less. all it would take is 1 reasonable vendor to balance the market and make some good $$ in the process.

				Would love to be able to get weed and mdma for a reasonable price domestic, so not $150 for a quarter of bush.

Some vendors are very good and if you want to do bulk orders and ship in multiple packages they&#039;ll change their &quot;profile&quot; for every order. Some of them really care about the cust service and getting the goods to you and will go through the headaches necessary.

				Going to fire sale my classic CD8N MDMA to get my 100 FB back. Pissed off a customer who was late to order when i specified I would be out of the office by 3pm, BTC reached my account after 3pm. Conditions of order sorry! Public listings burn vendors, so my fault. <br /><br />grams with either gratis xanax 2mg bars and a lucky order will get 20mg of Oxycontin CR included, and a very lucky mdma order will get 10 X 2mg xanax&nbsp; bars to come down from you pounding heart molly night. If you don&#039;t like oxy, specify in a message. first in gets it.&nbsp; in reverse order of listing in paragraph.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t think it isnt as good as the best EU MDMA, you basically don&#039;t know what quality MDMA is. This stuff is great and I really sell it this cheap so if you want some really clean awesome molly, get in fast. It wont last long. When you use Lab Reagent chemicals, no need to wash. <br /><br />good luck,you wont be disappointed, <br /><br />CD8N<br /><br />Good luck, <br />CD8N
